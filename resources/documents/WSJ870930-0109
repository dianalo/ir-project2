Although he was cited for reckless driving, a police statement said Sidy Kane was &quot;not arrested because . . . he's protected by diplomatic immunity.&quot;    Like the 37,000 other members of the foreign diplomatic community living in the U.S., Mr. Kane enjoys diplomatic immunity and cannot be arrested, prosecuted or sued for damages in connection with any crime.    Under a bill introduced by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, diplomatic immunity would be limited only to foreign diplomats and consular officials. Relatives, dependents and staff members attached to diplomatic missions could be prosecuted for drug trafficking, reckless driving and certain violent crimes.    Diplomatic immunity is a useful principle that enables emissaries to work abroad without being harassed. But why extend such privileges to people whose closest link with foreign policy may be chauffeuring an ambassador about town? Chuck Ashman, co-author of a recent book on the misuse of diplomatic immunity, says most crimes are committed by the sons, daughters, spouses and aides of diplomats. &quot;They are all briefed by their country's officials before they come here,&quot; he says, &quot;and they are told our laws can't touch them. As soon as a policeman comes to the scene, they claim diplomatic immunity.&quot;    Peter Christiansen, a retired police detective, told a Senate hearing last month that after weeks of work he arrested a man linked to at least 15 rapes in the New York City area. Although the suspect was positively identified by two victims, he had to be released because he was the son of Ghana's ambassador to the United Nations. The man spent 45 minutes in custody and left the police station laughing. He later returned voluntarily to his homeland.    The State Department has recorded only 31 cases of crimes committed under diplomatic immunity, but the American Federation of Police, a nonprofit group of law-enforcement officers, says hundreds of other cases aren't reported because they are dropped on the spot by local police in Washington, New York and the 37 other cities with consulates.    The State Department argues that diplomatic immunity must be granted to all foreign members of the diplomatic community in order to ensure that foreign governments don't retaliate by filing trumped-up charges against U.S. diplomats. But under the 1961 Vienna diplomatic convention, the U.S. has the right to question the fairness of a foreign judicial system -- as it did in the case of Turkey in the 1960s -- and negotiate to use its own legal rules. In addition, the U.S. already waives its immunity for the crimes specified in Senator Helms's bill, thereby following the principle of international reciprocity and minimizing potential resentment abroad.    Last Friday, Senator Helms attempted to attach his limitation on diplomatic immunity to a defense appropriations bill, but the move was tabled by a vote of 48-46. He plans to bring up the issue again soon both in the Foreign Relations Committee and on the Senate floor.    U.S. diplomats need to feel secure as they go about their business abroad, but the American principle of equal justice under law also needs to be upheld. Closing a legal loophole that allows foreign citizens who aren't diplomats to avoid responsibility for their actions would both deter future incidents and send a message that in this country respect for the rule of law prevails. </TEXT></DOC>
