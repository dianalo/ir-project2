The Commerce Department said the increase in the gross nationalproduct, the broadest measure of economic health, was a fullpercentage point higher than its original estimate made a month ago.   The initial report had put GNP growth in the April-June quarterat an anemic 1.7 percent. That was the poorest performance in threeyears and had increased fears that the economy could be facing animminent recession.   However, more recent government statistics have shown thateconomic activity in the second quarter was not as weak aspreviously believed, prompting economists to put away their gloomyforecasts of an impending downturn.   In another report today, the Commerce Department said sales ofnew homes shot up 14.4 percent in July, their biggest monthlyincrease in almost three years. The gain, which put sales at anannual rate of 739,000 units, was credited to the big drop inmortgage rates which occurred during the month.   Analysts said the exceptionally large upward revision in the GNPand the strong home sales report showed that the economy was movingahead at a healthy clip in the seventh year of the current expansion.   ``This is a clear indication, if anyone needed such assurance,that this economy is not headed into a recession,'' said LyleGramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association.   The White House was sure to be cheered by the upward revisionsince more robust economic growth makes it easier to meet theadministration's deficit-reduction goals.   In more good news, today's GNP report showed that inflation didnot worsen even though growth was stronger than originally thought.   An inflation gauge tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 5.1percent from April through June, down slightly from an originalestimate of 5.2 percent made a month ago. The increase in prices,which followed a rate of 4.8 percent in the first quarter, wasblamed on higher energy costs.   Almost two-thirds of today's upward revision in growth came fromhigher consumer spending than previously believed.   Consumer purchases climbed at an annual rate of 2.2 percent,double the previously reported rate.   Other areas of strength were government purchases, which rose ata rate of 12.3 percent, and spending for business investment, whichrose 8.2 percent.   One remaining area of weakness was housing construction, whichfell 12.6 percent in the second quarter, the biggest decline sincethe recession year of 1982.   The administration is forecasting that the economy will expand by2.9 percent this year, down from GNP growth of 4.4 percent in 1988,the fastest pace in four years.   To meet the administration's growth forecast, the economy wouldhave to expand at an annual rate of just 2.2 percent in the secondhalf of the year, a level that many economists believe is obtainable.   The administration two weeks ago criticized the Federal Reservefor keeping interest rates so high that they threatened to topplethe country into a recession.   However, today's report was likely to strengthen the Fed'sresolve to keep rates about where they are now, given the businesssignals showing that growth remains fairly robust.   In another report today, the government said that corporateprofits after taxes fell a sharp 5.4 percent in the second quarter.The decline, which followed a 1.1 percent drop in the first threemonths of the year, was the biggest setback since a 16.5 percentdecline in the first quarter of 1986.   Trade was another bright spot in the GNP report. The tradedeficit declined by $2.5 billion in the second quarter, reflectingthe fact that exports grew at a faster rate than imports.   The 2.7 percent GNP growth rate in the second quarter followed a3.7 percent increase in the first quarter. However, most of thefirst-quarter advance stemmed from a rebound in the farm sectorfollowing last summer's drought. The non-farm economy actually grewat a lackluster 1.5 percent rate in the first quarter.   The various changes in the GNP put the total output of goods andservices at an annual rate of $4.134 trillion in the second quarter,after adjusting for inflation.</TEXT></DOC>
