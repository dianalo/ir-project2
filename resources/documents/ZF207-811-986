 We will devote the next issue of this Report to a fullreview of events related to traditional publishing markets, with news ofmass-market desktop products filling the October and November issues of theSeybold Report on Desktop Publishing.andP;  This summary of highlights will serveas a guide to finding in which issue to look for various types of coverage.andM;Where we list the relevant issues, we will abbreviate this Report as SRPS andthe desktop report as SRDP, specifying Oct. or Nov. for the appropriateissue.andM;Output, fonts, PostScriptandM;Secret no longer.andP;  Adobe's sudden conversion to the open-format religion waswelcome news for the industry, but for a growing number of vendors, Adobereally hadn't any secrets left to hide.andP;  Printware became the latest firm toadd the ability to handle encrypted Adobe fonts in its 600- and 1200-dpimachines.andP;  (RIPS has been doing it for nearly a year.)andP;  The Companydemonstrated a program that performs authomatic hint-insertion and generationof fonts in Adobe's Type One format.andP;  A module to generate Apple Royal-formatfonts is under development.andP;  (Oct.andP;  SRDP)andM;The Univeristy of California (Berkeley Computing Department) is now licensingthe entire source code for a prototype PostScript interpreter program,including the routines for encrypting and decrypting Type One fonts.andP;  Beforethe show, it had been charging $10,000; in view of events, it may decide tocut the price.andP;  (Oct.andP;  SRDP)andM;PostScript horsepower.andP;  Several vendors (among them Sritech and PipelineAssociates) showed laser printer controllers based on the Advanced MicroDevices 29000 processor.andP;  This RISC chip is rated at 17.5 MIPS average and 25MIPS in burst mode (where the data and instructions are already in the chip'sinternal pipeline), which should give approximately ten times the performanceof the 68000 processor used in the original Apple LaserWriter.andP;  (Oct.andP;  SRDP)andM;However, the AMD 29000 is not the only hot chip around.andP;  Raster ImageProcessing Systems, whose controller is used in the Itek Graphix and BirmyGraphics imagesetters, has ported its code to the Intel i960.andP;  The i960 isavailable in several versions, allowing a tradeoff of price and speed; thelatest version (which RIPS is not yet using) averages 44 RISC MIPS and can begoosed up to bursts of 66 MIPS.andP;  (Oct.andP;  SRDP)andM;Harlequin Software brought a Transputer-based controller to the show.andO;Transputer chips, although they are 10-MIPS RISC processors in their ownright, are disigned for parallel processing; with property written software,you can speed up a system merely by plugging in more chips.andP;  Unfortunately,making PostScript run in a parallel computer has turned out to be a trickybusiness, and Harlequin is the first firm to claim success.andP;  However, it didnot show any printed output at the Conference.andP;  Look for a productannouncement in mid-winter, we were told.andP;  (Oct.andP;  SRDP)andM;Eicon described a new 200-dpi flatbed laser plotter developed by its sistercompany, escher-Grad.andP;  Coupled with Eicon's PostScript RIP, the new machineshould sell for under $80,000.andP;  (Oct.andP;  SRDP)andM;The font front.andP;  Kingsley/ATF shipped its first fonts, featuring its ownhinting scheme and &quot;optical scaling.&quot;andP;  A utility program to generate Macscreen fonts and modify kerning tables will be bundled with each font pack.andO;Giampa Textware is a new company selling something old: revivals of fontsfrom the Lanston Monotype library.andP;  So far, it has produced seven fornts inMacintosh PostScript form.andP;  (Oct.andP;  SRDP)andM;Altsys upgraded its KeyMaster logo editor program to handle 256 logos (upfrom 16) and renamed it The Art Importer.andP;  (Oct.andP;  SRDP)andM;AsiaGraphics has begun designing and marketing PostScript fonts for theJapanese, Chinese and Korean markets.andP;  The price is reasonable: less than$1,000 per font--under 15 cents per character.andP;  (Oct.andP;  SRDP)andM;Font tools.andP;  The Company demonstrated software that makes Adobe Type 1 fonds(automatically generating the hints) and said that it is developingfont-making tools for Apple's Royal font format.andP;  Kingsley/ATF is finishingup a commercial version of its Mac font editor program, Type Designer I.andP;  Itwill be priced higher than competing products, but putatively offershigher-quality output.andP;  (Oct.andP;  SRDP)andM;High-resolution PostScript imagesetters.andP;  Linotype said that thelong-promised Ethernet option for its RIP III will be available by year end.andO;Monotype increased the number of fonts it bundles with its PostScript RIP toinclude the 35 LaserWriter Plus core fonts.andP;  Birmy and Varityper/Tegraintroduced PostScript imagesetters based on the ECRM PelBox 3000.andP;  (SRPS)andM;Optronics said that it has applied for a patent on a new halftone screeningprocess that allows precise control over dot shape and edge density at allangles and at frequencies from 65 to 300 lines per inch.andP;  It intends tolicense the patent to competitors as well as use the technology in its ownproducts.andP;  (SRPS)andM;Low-resolution PostScript.andP;  Seiko's new model 5500 color printer can renderPostScript for just $7,000--if you run Custom Applications' softwarePostScript RIP, Freedom of Press, in your own PC.andP;  CAI says that the latestversion of Freedom supports all color extensions to the PostScript language.andO;(Oct.andP;  SRDP)andM;Oce showed a more expensive color printer ($18,000), but one that has morebuilt-in functionality: an Adobe controller and Pantone-certified colors.andO;The printer fetures a plastic-based ink sheet rather than wax-based ink.andO;(Oct.andP;  SRDP)andM;Two vendors showed finished Macintosh version of their PostScriptinterpreters for the screen: Lincoln and Pipeline.andP;  (Oct.andP;  SRDP)andM;Of course, there were lots of vendors offering 300- and 400-dpi PostScriptprinters.andP;  And National Semiconductor and Texas Instruments touted theirspecialized graphics processors for PostScript printer controllers.andP;  (Oct.andO;SRDP)andM;Non-PostScript output.andP;  Xitron gave what it claimed was the first U.S.andO;showing of a new 600-dpi printer from Hitachi.andP;  Like other Xitron printers,it supports Ace, Cora, Compugraphic and Autologic input, as well as nearlycomplete PostScript.andP;  (SRPS)andM;Meanwhile, Applied Publishing Technologies unveiled the latest capabilitiesfor its Chameleon output systems: support for network functionality using aNovell network.andP;  (SRPS)andM;Ultre introduced a SCSI interface for its UltreSetter.andM;Canon exhibited a very nice color copier/printer, the CLC 500.andP;  But it willbe a while before the arrival of software to take advantage of it.andP;  (Nov.andO;SRDP)andM;Type distortion.andP;  One area that has become a hotbed of activity is thedistortion or modification of type for use in headlines and design work.andO;Berthold has been selling a high-end product, called the Berthold Headliner,for close to a year.andP;  Letraset has been offering a less capable product,called LetraStudio, for a similar period of time.andP;  Broderbund demonstratedits nearly finished TypeStyler, which features a nice user interface and lowprice.andP;  Emerald City, which offers the attractive capability of readingPostScript files from a hard disk and displaying them, demonstrated itsthree-volume pack of Smart Art.andP;  (Nov.andP;  SRDP)andM;Composition systemsandM;Although there weren't any brand-new composition systems, some vendorsdemonstrated enhancements of note.andP;  Magna has added a nice footnoting programbased on the former CCI routine.andP;  Frame has frozen the code for its landmark2.0 release and will begin shipments in October.andP;  Itek Graphix added supportfor the Xerox 7650 scanner to its Designitek, plus significant typographicenhancements, and added performance boosts and a code-conversion program tothe InPrint system.andP;  (SRPS)andM;Miles 33 showed new magazine software, ready for shipment to a test site inOctober.andM;Atex is nearing release of its PC PageMakeup system, which has been in betatesting for a few months and now supports use of a Writer Software PC for handamp;jof text files against the layout specified on the layout (Archetype)workstation.andP;  DP Telos previewed version 2.5 of its software, includingfacilities for handling directory work and a sophisticated programminglanguage.andP;  (SRPS)andM;Mycro-Tek reported the status of its Quark Xtension for paginating its textand AdWriter files.andP;  Personal TeX unveiled a new, faster preview for itsPC-based documentation system.andP;  (SRPS)andM;Multi-Ad previewed a new version of its Creator for display ads, with someuseful enhancements.andM;Ultimate Technographics demonstrated an alpha version of a PostScript previewcalled PostView, which uses an Eicon board and Bitstream fonts.andP;  (SRPS)andM;Penta demonstrated typographic enhancements to its system, including sectorkerning, plus a new DG computer.andM;Information International showed a new version of DocuPro, saying it isfinally about ready for the market.andM;ArborText unveiled the 3.0 release of The Publisher for Sun workstations andgave a preview of its software running in Apollo hardware under X Window.andO;(SRPS)andM;As expected, Aldus showed PageMaker running under Presentation Manager.andP;  OS/2now confers some advantages over Windows, but real gains will have to await a'386-specific version of OS/2.andP;  Sun's demonstration of PageMaker running on a386i merely showed how bad Sun's DOS-compatibility mode really is.andP;  (Nov.andO;SRDP)andM;Letraset demonstrated the beginning of what it hopes will bring it from thedesktop market to the graphic arts arena.andP;  Its product, Design Studio,provides a lot of quality composition features--kerning, tracking,justification based on the optimum interword space, good controls overhyphenation, etc.--with a ReadySetGo style of user interface on theMacintosh.andP;  (Nov.andP;  SRDP)andM;Silicon Beach's forthcoming Personal Press was designed for computer novicesrather than professional publishers; although its composition engine wasn'thooked up yet, its other features pushed it beyond most entry-level programs,but not to the point of threatening PageMaker or Xpress.andP;  (Nov.andP;  SRDP)andM;Building forms on the desktop.andP;  A recent spate of form-creation anddata-entry programs gave us hope that a paper (which, after all, is whatmakes the world go round) might finally be on its way out.andP;  As we looked overXerox's ElixiForm and FormBase, Aldus's TrueForm, Delrina's PerForm (with itslink to IBM's FAWN archiving system), Information International's FormMasterand VisionSoft's still-unnamed developmental product, we realized that eachhas a part of the solution.andP;  What's missing, though, it forms software fornetworks, and robust networks that can support the level of informationsharing tha's needed.andP;  (Oct.andP;  SRDP)andM;Color systemsandM;Crosfield Lightspeed showed a major new software release, version 2.0.andP;  Thepackage contains a comprehensive set of typographic tools, including rotatedtype, text wraparounds, automatic dropped capitals, foreign language support,and hung punctuation.andP;  (SRPS)andM;CyberChrome showed a prototype of an image-editing workstation.andP;  Theworkstation is the result of a joint effort with Everex and Time Arts.andP;  Ituses bit-sliced chips for some of the data-intensive aspects of imageprocessing.andP;  The workstation should be ready around the end of the year.andP;  Thetarget price is $75,000.andP;  (Nov.andP;  SRDP)andM;Pre-Press Technologies has radically restructured its product line.andP;  Thereare now four levels offered: a $295 separation module for the desktop market,a scanner control and separation package at $695, a basic image adjustmentand separation package at $995, and a comprehensive and powerful $6,000package for color adjustment and separation.andP;  (Nov.andP;  SRDP)andM;Networked Picture Systems showed Design Express, a retouching package for usewith an NPS system or with a high-end prepress system.andP;  NPS has alsointroduced a set of tools for moving Open Prepress Interface files fromdesktop publishing sources into the NPS system.andP;  (SRPS)andM;Pansophic introduced PressWork, a hardware and software package that includescomposition software developed by Archetype and color separation softwarefrom Pre-Press Technologies.andP;  Pricing was not yet fixed.andP;  (SRPS)andM;In the Silicon Graphics booth, Full Color Computing showed its powerful FullColor Publisher package for image assembly and retouching.andP;  For publishingapplications, it can output via Scitex systems.andP;  The software starts at$9,000 and runs on Silicon Graphics workstation in the $20,000-plus range.andO;(SRPS)andM;Letraset and Optronics announced an interesting technology agreement thatwill provide the former with some new color production software from thelatter.andM;Color scanners.andP;  A variety of new color scanners appeared at the show.andP;  Mostwere based on linear CCD arrays.andM;Sharp showed its new JX-600, which scans at resolutions from 30 to 600 dpi.andO;It carries a $14,995 list price.andP;  Sharp also had a tiny handheld colorscanner (200 dpi, 4&quot; X 6&quot; image area) for $995.andP;  (Nov.andP;  SRDP)andM;Howtek, which up to now has been a major reseller of Sharp scanners,introduced a machine of its own, the Scanmaster 3.andP;  This 400-dpi unit, shownin a hotel suite off the show floor, is aimed primarily at the OEM market.andO;It has been designed specifically to improve on earlier machines,particularly in tonal range and avoidance of streak artifacts.andP;  End-userpricing will start at around $8,200.andP;  Howtek also showed enhancements to itscolor prepress system.andP;  (SRPS)andM;Siemens showed a prototype of its 400/800-dpi scanner, also an OEM product,which will cost the end user around $7,500 when it is released in the firstquarter of next year.andP;  (Nov.andP;  SRDP)andM;Barneyscan didn't show a new scanner, but it did have new software forscanner and retouching.andP;  (Nov.andP;  SRDP)andM;Dainippon Screen used the show to focus on its line of OEM color scannerproducts.andP;  These range from desktop flatbeds at 800 dpi carrying an end-userprice around $8,000-$10,000 up to drum scanners in the $70,000 price range.andO;(SRPS)andM;Microtek delivered a price shock with the MSF-300Z, which can input 24-bitcolor (in three passes) or 8-bits of grayscale data; with a PC or Macinterface, it sells for less than $2,700--worth looking at for low-endapplications.andP;  (Nov.andP;  SRDP)andM;Not everyone is using CCDs, though.andP;  Array Technologies showed its new ArrayScanner One.andP;  This $20,000 image capture device uses a novel 288 X 288-pixelphotodiode array as its sensing mechanism.andP;  Using a piezo-electricmicropostioning mechanism, Array collects image data of up to 8,000 X 8,000pixels.andP;  The machine can be configured to scan slides, opaque originals, and3-D objects.andP;  OEMs are the principal market.andP;  (SRPS)andM;Calibrating displays.andP;  Calibration of color monitors got a boost as Radiusentered the field.andP;  The Radius product costs $695 and works only withRadius's own display card and with Radius or Apple monitors.andP;  It is intendedto keep monitors consistent from day to day, and to ensure consistent coloramong a group monitors.andP;  Barco, which had previously introduced itsself-calibrating monitor, emphasized that its approach ties the colors on thescreen to recognized color standards, and that it is able (through carefuldesign of the monitor's electronics) to keep tight control on color changebetween calibrations.andM;Linking high-end and desktop color.andP;  With Hell Graphics showing its newdesktop link to the color system, and with significant additions to bothCrosfield's Lightspeed System and Scitex's Visionary system, all the majorhigh-end color vendors seem to be making a serious effort to extend theirreach to the desktop color market.andM;The systems vary in capabilities and approach, but the basic message isclear.andP;  The designer can define page geometry, set type, create line art, andspecify graphic elements on an off-the-shelf Macintosh system.andP;  The piece canbe proofed on a LaserWriter or comp'ed using standard color printers like theQMS ColorScript or Du Pont 4Cast.andP;  Once the design is complete, the piece israsterized into the native format of the high-end system, where anexperienced color operator can handle production considerations such as GCR,chokes, spreads, and dot gain.andP;  High-quality color scans from Hell orCrosfield drum scanners can replace the (for-position-only) desktop scans.andM;The gain for the user:  full control of the design, high throughput andquality, and a saving on very expensive operator time.andP;  For the color house:a large and growing potential user base and direct competition against theall-desktop systems.andM;Monochrome graphicsandM;Several vendors shared the gray-level editing software spotlight.andP;  XeroxImaging Systems touted its new Gray F/X package, which was largelydevelopedby Media Cybernetics and is similar to that firm's Publisher'sPartner.andP;  Agfa Compugraphic revealed a strongly enhanced version (2.0) of itsMC View Plus program.andP;  Astral showed the 2.0 release of Picture Publisher forPCs and previewed the port of the gray-scale editing software to the Mac.andO;(Nov.andP;  SRDP)andM;Apollo introduced its lowest-priced workstation to date and with it desktopsoftware--iWrite, iPaint and iDraw.andP;  The three new programs will be the firstpackages Island Graphics markets under its own label.andM;The PC-compatible world is plagued by a host of incompatible image formats.andO;Harvard Systems showed its utility package for getting images from one toanother with the least loss of image quality.andP;  (Nov.andP;  SRDP)andM;A new version of Arts andamp; Letters (by Computer Support Corp.) adds smart fileformat conversion, autotracing of bitmaps and other goodies.andP;  (Nov.andP;  SRDP)andM;ZSoft added more features to PC Paintbrush IV, but for some reason left theCMYK color model out of the product (it supports RGB and HSV color only).andO;(Nov.andP;  SRDP)andM;An unexpected combination of photo-retouching and photorealistic 3D renderingwas presented by Enabling Technologies.andP;  The software, which will run on Macsor DOS machines, produces effects that are difficult to achieve via separatepackages.andP;  (Nov.andP;  SRDP)andM;Monochrome scanners.andP;  In monochrome input, 8-bit scanners were the order ofthe day; nearly all vendors in this field showed units that could input 256levels of gray.andP;  The most notable development was Agfa Compugraphic movingits Focus scanner up to 8 bits of grayscale data per pixel.andP;  Another trendwas the profusion of handheld scanners, including Marstek's 5&quot; Mars-128 andLogitech's new 400-dpi ScanMan Plus for PCs.andP;  (Nov.andP;  SRDP)andM;Writing and editing toolsandM;Xyquest gave a sneak preview of XyWrite IV, which offers a reasonably fast,editable WYSIWYG view of a document and is due to be released early nextyear.andP;  Lennane Advanced Products not only showed the DeScribe &quot;wordpublisher,&quot; it also used this occasion to change the company name toDeScribe, Inc.andP;  (Nov.andP;  SRDP)andM;A pair of grammar checkers made a splash: Grammatik IV, Reference Software'snewest entrant, which is being released this month for both PC and Mac, andCritique, an impressive newcomer from IBM that--so far, at least--runs onlyon hardware far above the &quot;desktop&quot; level.andP;  (Nov.andP;  SRDP)andM;Mainstay showed an intriguing preview of a product in earlydevelopment--Audio MarkUp, a version of its document annotation software thatwill enable users to attach and listen to revisable voice annotations.andP;  (Nov.andO;SRDP)andM;SoftQuad revealed its developments on the Sun platform and severalsignificant enhancements for the next (2.0) release of Author/Editor.andP;  U.S.andO;Lynx previewed an InterMedia-like product for the Macintosh that should beavailable early next year.andP;  (SRPS)andM;Two software-based educational tools showed their potential worth.andP;  Publishby Design, interactive training software from Online Computer Systems, helpsbring novice desktop publishers up to speed.andP;  Petroglyph displayed apre-release version of an online reference for writers and editors that runsunder Silicon Beach's SuperCard hypertext environment.andM;Optical character recognition.andP;  Calera expanded its high-end OCR product linewith TopScan Professional and TopScan Macintosh, both due to be shipped thismonth.andP;  Xerox Imaging Systems spotlighted the Kurzweil 5100 system's newability to convert scanned text into Interleaf and FrameMaker documentformats.andP;  Toshiba devoted its entire booth to Express Reader, anAT-compatible OCR board due out in December.andP;  (Nov.andP;  SRDP)andM;On the increasingly packed software-only OCR playing field, Inovatic showedReadStar VI, which combines the trainability and automatic operation of itsearlier products.andM;We also test-drove programs from CTA, Ocron (in the Advanced Vision Researchand Umax booths), OCR Systems, and Xerox Imaging Systems' Datacopy division.andO;(Nov.andP;  SRDP)andM;Text storage and retrieval.andP;  Mainstay's Marco Polo won admiration for theease and speed with which it stored documents and retrieved those that metspecified requirements.andP;  (Nov.andP;
