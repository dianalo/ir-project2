The enterprise could be the largest in China to be wholly owned by a U.S. company, Motorola Chairman Robert Galvin told reporters here. The extent of Motorola's investment in China hasn't been announced yet, but Mr. Galvin confirmed that Motorola will spend &quot;multi-tens of millions of dollars&quot; to develop these plants in Tianjian, the port closest to Beijing.    The move by Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., is an apparent response to recent decisions by the U.S. and its allies to allow China to obtain far higher levels of western technology than is allowed the Soviet bloc. Paul Freedenberg, undersecretary of commerce for export administration, predicted that by next year China could export 32-bit microprocessors with the help of Motorola and other U.S. concerns.    Such a capability would put China on the same footing as Taiwan, South Korea and other newly industrialized countries as a producer of parts of high-quality personal computers, and perhaps eventually of the computers themselves.    Mr. Freedenberg said other U.S. technology producers with Chinese plants or distribution outlets, such as Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, Calif., and Wang Laboratories Inc., Lowell, Mass., stand to benefit from the relaxed export controls. A Hewlett-Packard spokesman said its joint-venture factory in Shenzhen in southern China assembles HP 3000 computers from imported kits but could advance to full manufacturing status some day.    Reporting on a recent trip to China, the chief U.S. export regulator said Beijing is responding satisfactorily to U.S. concerns about protecting technology from illegal diversion. He added that the 1988 trade act will authorize U.S. concerns to send bulk shipments of technology products to China, a major improvement over the current requirement for individual licenses for every product to be shipped.    A spokeswoman for the Semiconductor Industry Association, the U.S. trade lobby, acknowledged that Chinese-produced chips could compete someday with U.S. devices in various markets. But she stressed that arrangements such as Motorola's likely will be &quot;symbiotic&quot; because of the opening they give Motorola and other U.S. vendors to the growing Chinese market.    In his remarks, Mr. Galvin wouldn't specify the type of products the Tianjian plant will produce, except to say they would include both &quot;transistors and integrated circuits.&quot; He stressed, though, that the venture is intended to be a &quot;model&quot; to instruct China in operating high-technology production lines. &quot;This won't be just another feeder plant or low-cost offshore base,&quot; he said.    Mr. Galvin was here to receive a major Commerce Department award for product quality on behalf of Motorola. Two other U.S. concerns, Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, and Globe Metallurgical Inc., a unit of Moore McCormack Resources Inc., Stamford, Conn., won the same award, which is named after Malcolm Baldrige, a secretary of commerce who died in office.    Mr. Galvin vowed that Motorola will spend &quot;half a billion dollars&quot; in the next 10 years to sharpen the quality of its products and services. </TEXT></DOC>
