The agreement was initialed by negotiators from both nations, butstill has to be formally signed.   It came two weeks after President Bush warned the Koreans theyfaced a possible ban on shipments of their fishery products to theUnited States if an agreement was not reached by the end ofSeptember.   Earlier this year, drift net treaties were negotiated with Japanand Taiwan, whose fleets along with the one from South Korea fishthe international waters in the North Pacific.   Ed Wolfe, the State Department's ambassador for oceans andfisheries, said the treaties provide for a ``cooperative enforcementprogram designed to minimize interception of U.S.-origin salmon anda cooperative monitoring program designed to assess incidental takeof a wide variety of marine resources.''   Under international law, only American fishermen are allowed tocatch salmon spawned in the United States.   The Korean agreement grants U.S. enforcement officers``unrestricted authority'' to board and inspect Korean drift netvessels to search for evidence of catches of fish spawned in theUnited States, Wolfe said.   In addition, all Korean drift net vessels will have to beequipped with satellite transponders by the 1990 fishing season.These would allow U.S. officials to keep track of the location ofvessels to ensure they don't fish outside designated areas.   In exchange, the Koreans will be allowed to fish an expanded areaof the North Pacific in May.   More than 700 vessels from Japan, Korean and Taiwan have beenusing drift nets in the North Pacific, ostensibly to catch squid.   But U.S. fishing groups claim they are actually fishing forsalmon that spawn in North America and swim the Pacific Ocean.Salmon runs in Alaska, Washington state and Oregon have alreadysuffered as a result of the catches, the American groups say.   Environmentalists also complain that use of the drift nets, whichthey call ``walls of death,'' result in the deaths of thousands ofmarine mammals and seabirds annually.</TEXT></DOC>
