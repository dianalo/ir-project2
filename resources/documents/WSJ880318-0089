Stevens (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP FREST JAPAN CANDA </CO><IN> PCS CMD MON FRX </IN><TEXT>   The dollar strengthened on the back of yesterday's report on U.S. merchandise trade that showed a smaller deficit for January than most analysts expected. But a sustained advance by the dollar remains unlikely, traders said.    Meanwhile, the Bank of England cut a key interest rate, prompting rate reductions by British commercial banks. Traders interpreted the action as a U.K. government attempt to contain the pound's recent surge, especially against other European currencies. But sterling continued to strengthen against the bellwether West German mark.    The Commerce Department's report that the U.S. trade gap widened to $12.44 billion in January, from $12.2 billion in December, confirmed the more optimistic forecasts and caught most currency traders by surprise. An average of estimates by economists surveyed by the Dow Jones News Service before the release placed the deficit at $12.8 billion, and many traders said they were looking for a figure between $13 billion and $14 billion.    The news lifted the dollar to 1.6915 marks in late New York trading, up 0.9% from 1.6765 Wednesday. The dollar climbed 0.8% to 128.65 yen, from 127.58.    In midmorning trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was quoted at 128.40 yen.    The dollar's rise was exaggerated, however, according to traders, because much of the demand for the U.S. currency yesterday came from speculators buying dollars to cover short, or oversold positions established before the trade report. These speculators were expecting a wider trade deficit for January, and that the dollar would fall.    &quot;We all got caught and had to run for cover,&quot; said Peter Wild, first vice president and treasurer at Bank Julius Baer andamp; Co., New York. &quot;That was the big part of the (dollar's) move,&quot; he said.    Immediately after the 8:30 a.m. EST trade report, the dollar bounced up to 1.6850 marks and 128.30 yen, from 1.6750 marks and 127.40 yen before the release.    The dollar's rally was interrupted within an hour of the trade news by selling from traders taking quick profits on the currency's rise. Dealers interpreted the bout of profit-taking as another indication of bearish sentiment in the market and lack of confidence in the dollar's ability to sustain a rally.    &quot;The dollar has a limited upside potential, and it remains more vulnerable on the downside,&quot; said David C. Redding, vice president of money market economics at Bankers Trust Co., New York.    After the round of profit-taking, the dollar slid back to 1.6733 marks and 127.70 yen.    Traders attributed their limited expectations for the dollar to factors other than trade, including the federal budget deficit and political uncertainty of an election year. And despite progress in closing the trade deficit over recent months, traders said the narrowing has been slow and halting and that the gap still remains wide. Although better than expected, the latest trade news &quot;doesn't change the big picture&quot; for the dollar's outlook, Robert Hatcher, vice president and corporate foreign exchange dealer at Barclays Bank PLC, New York, said. For the near term the dollar will likely trade in ranges between 1.67 and 1.71 marks and 127 and 130 yen. &quot;Instead of trading at the lower end of the range, we'll trade at the upper end,&quot; Mr. Hatcher said.    In other trading, after a brief dip following British interest rate cuts yesterday, the pound resumed its advance against European currencies. Although the pound weakened against the dollar, along with most other major currencies, falling to $1.8333 late yesterday, from $1.8480, it climbed to 3.1010 marks, from 3.0982.    After the Bank of England cut its money market intervention rate a half-point, British commercial banks responded by lowering their base rates a half-point to 8.5%. The lower rates make sterling less attractive for foreign investors. But traders remained bullish on the pound because yields for sterling-denominated investments are still significantly higher than for investments denominated in dollars or marks, and the British economy is seen as robust.    Mr. Hatcher said the Bank of England's rate cuts appeared to be an attempt by Britain to keep the pound from rising too high. A stronger currency hurts British exporters by making their products more costly abroad.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $1.30 an ounce to $444 in brisk trading. The estimated volume was 4.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $444.20 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---              Late New York Trading             Thursday, March 17, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
