Newspapers have reported that the younger woman recently gavebirth to a boy at a Rome hospital after carrying to term theartificially fertilized egg of her 48-year-old mother. The sperm ofthe daughter's 35-year-old stepfather was reportedly used tofertilize the egg.   The recent reports have touched off a debate in medical andreligious circles over the ethical questions raised. Some doctorsand scientists have expressed doubt that the episode occurred.   The daily La Stampa of Turin reported that the stepfather wantedhis own children, but that his wife, already the mother of the20-year-old and two other children, had been advised against furtherpregnancies.   The family discussed the matter with a gynecologist, and thedaughter volunteered to ``lend'' her womb to her mother, the papersaid without citing sources.   Newspaper reports have not identified the people involved or saidexactly when the child was born.   The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano criticized the peopleinvolved and called the case ``unacceptable experimentation thatkills the dignity of the person.''   The newspaper cited a document on respect for human life byCardinal Joseph Ratzinger, a Vatican official in charge of theCongregation for Doctrine of the Faith.   ``What happened in these days is a consequence of not acceptingthat from a moral point of view, responsible procreation must resultfrom a conjugal act. If separation of procreation from the conjugalact is permitted, conception becomes a question of mere technicalreproduction. And terms such as conjugal love, maternity andprocreation become meaningless,'' the newspaper said in an editorial.   ``The girl was painfully used as an object; she was used for ninemonths as an incubator, a prisoner of the egotism of the mother andof the detestable techniques. She killed her dignity as a woman. Shedefinitely injured her personal future,'' the newspaper said.</TEXT></DOC>
