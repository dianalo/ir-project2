<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-38-1152 </DOCNO><TEXT>In fission reactions and deep inelastic processes states of large angularmomentum are produced which deexcite themselves by emission of photons.The part of a gamma spectrum corresponding to high transition energies(Eandgt;2 MeV) reveals its statistical origin by a nearly exponential dependenceon the excitation energy. A reason for this is an exponential dependenceof level densities entering the process. At low energies one observessome humped structure in the gamma deexcitation spectrum and in a sidefeeding pattern. There are two bumps entering the probability of theside feeding vs angular momentum. I try to explain this kind of behaviourusing a ''closed'' model for calculating level densities and consistingof a realistic interaction. The model for treating fermions is a Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubovprocedure. The outcoming single quasiparticle energies together withwave functions give a good basis for calculating both level densitiesand matrix elements of transition operators entering the calculationsof gamma spectra. 7 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
