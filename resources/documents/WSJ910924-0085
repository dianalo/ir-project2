The Wilmington, Del., chemical and aerospace company saidit has signed secrecy agreements with a number of companiesthat are experimenting with Slendid, including certain fastfood companies that it declined to name. Hercules said itexpects one or more of these companies to have products usingthe pectin-based fat substitute on the market within the nextfew months.</LP><TEXT>   Supermarket shelves are already getting crowded withproducts aimed at what is expected to be a $1 billion annualmarket for fat substitutes that sharply reduce the amount ofcalories in food. Slendid, the first fat substitute made frompectin, joins the ranks of multipurpose fat substitutes suchas Simplesse, made by Monsanto Co. from egg whites or whey, amilk product, and Stellar, a fat replacer made from cornstarch by the A.E. Staley Mfg. Co. unit of Tate andamp; Lyle PLC,among others.   Food and Drug Administration approval isn't required tosell the fat substitute, said Hercules, which has been makingpectin products for nearly 50 years. Pectin, a carbohydrateoccuring naturally in all fruits and vegetables, is commonlyused as a thickener in jams and jellies.   Thomas L. Gossage, Hercules chairman and chief executiveofficer, said in an interview that he would be &quot;verydisappointed&quot; if the new product doesn't capture more than10%, or more than $50 million in annual sales, of the $500million a year fat substitute market in the U.S. He said thecompany eventually hopes to carve out a similar piece of theoverseas market for fat substitutes, which he said could alsoeventually grow to $500 million a year.   Wall Street reacted positively to the Slendidannouncement. Hercules' shares were quoted at $41.625, up $2,in late New York Stock Exchange trading.   Robert Reitzes, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence Inc. in NewYork, said: &quot;This is a minor plus for the company. It couldadd five cents to 10 cents a share to annual earnings in afew years, and position Hercules as a prime player in theflavors market.&quot; Last year Hercules reported net income of$96 million, or $2.04 a share.   Mr. Gossage said that Slendid took about two years and $2million to develop. Hercules technicians in the U.S. and at aHercules plant in Denmark, which is the world's leadingproducer of pectin, developed the product by purifyingpectin, he said. Commercial demand for the product willinitially be supplied by the Denmark plant, with productionbeing added at a plant in Florida and one in Germany incoming months, he added.   Slendid will be sold in powdered form, then mixed withwater by commercial users to mimic emulsified fats. Theparticles in the water have the physical and sensorycharacteristics, or &quot;mouthfeel,&quot; of fats, but no taste,Hercules said. The product can be used to replace up to 100%of the fat in products including dressings, soups, sauces,baked goods, frozen desserts, processed cheeses, yogurt,spreads and other foods, the company said.   In a four-course lunch served in Chicago to introduce theproduct, featuring soup, salad and dressing, cold salmon withmayonnaise sauce and cheesecake, the use of Slendid in eachcourse reduced the total calories per meal by 60% to 502 from1,273 calories, Hercules said.</TEXT></DOC>
