Irvington Station Unit 3 in Tucson will continue tooperate on natural gas or oil, and modification work toinclude coal as an alternative boiler fuel by 1992 has beenhalted, the company said.</LP><TEXT>   In 1981, the U.S. Department of Energy ordered the companyto convert the Irvington Station to coal in accordance withthe Power Plant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978.Rescinded in 1987, the act would have prohibited power plantsfrom burning natural gas as a boiler fuel after 1990.   By not completing the conversion of Unit 3, the companyestimates that it will avoid $25 million in additionalconstruction expenditures.   Tucson Electric has been troubled by a stream ofmisdirected investments in real estate and financialservices, as well as by apparent excess construction ofgenerating capacity. In January, cash-flow problems forcedthe company to eliminate its quarterly dividend on commonstock for the first time since it went public in 1946.</TEXT></DOC>
