From its portfolio of leveraged buy-out investments,Citicorp is seeking to sell its approximately 42% stake inReliance Electric Co., which could fetch $350 million to $400million, Wall Street sources said.</LP><TEXT>   As expected, Citicorp unveiled separate plans for aninitial public offering of 50.3% of its Ambac Indemnity Corp.municipal bond insurance unit that would raise about $500million.   Both sales would improve Citicorp's capital as apercentage of its assets. The Ambac offering would have abigger impact, because it would also have the effect ofremoving about $25 billion of assets from Citicorp's balancesheet as calculated by banking regulators.   Because regulators will require banking companies tomaintain capital equal to 4% of assets by the end of nextyear, removing $25 billion of assets &quot;is the equivalent ofraising $1 billion of capital,&quot; said Thomas E. Jones, aCiticorp executive vice president.   Mr. Jones said the Ambac offering would improve Citicorp'sratio of Tier 1 capital (defined as common equity pluscertain preferred stock) to assets by 0.35 percentage point.At March 31, Citicorp had Tier 1 capital equal to 3.75% ofassets. The Ambac sale, therefore, would put Citicorp overthe 1992 regulatory requirement, barring any big losses orsharp increases in assets.   Mr. Jones said Citicorp expects to realize a gain on theAmbac offering, but wouldn't estimate its size. The offeringis expected to be completed in about two months.   Citicorp filed a preliminary registration statement withthe Securities and Exchange Commission for 17.6 millionshares of Ambac Inc., a newly formed holding company for itsmunicipal bond insurance business. The maximum proposed priceis $28 a share; the number of shares sold could be increasedto as many as 20.2 million.   Citicorp will retain a voting interest in Ambac of only20%, and could relinquish that voting power about nine monthsafter the initial public offering. The low voting stake isintended to satisfy banking regulators that Ambac's assetscan be removed from Citicorp's books.   Ambac had assets of $1.23 billion at year end. Bankingregulators use a much larger amount in figuring Citicorp'scapital ratio because Ambac has guaranteed about $86.2billion of bonds.   In the filing, Ambac reported revenue of $162.4 millionand net income of $105.5 million last year. The companyexpects to declare an initial dividend rate of 40 cents ashare per year, the filing said.   Reliance Electric is widely regarded as the mostattractive investment among about 100 minority non-votingstakes that Citicorp owns in companies that went throughleveraged buy-outs. Though there have been periodic rumorsthat Citicorp wants to sell the entire portfolio, the bankingcompany has apparently focused on the sale of its Reliancestake. Reliance said it has hired Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. andPrudential Securities Inc. to explore various optionsregarding its capital structure. Wall Street sources saidthese likely include looking for a buyer of the Citicorpstake.   While declining to comment on Reliance, Mr. Jones said,&quot;There is an effort to move the larger positions {in the LBOportfolio} as the market can absorb them, but it's nothingunusual.&quot;   Reliance, a former unit of Exxon Corp., was taken privatein a 1986 leveraged buy-out led by Citicorp, PrudentialSecurities and the industrial company's management. Reliance,based in Cleveland, makes electric motors.   Since then, Reliance &quot;has been doing great,&quot; says SalomonBrothers Inc. analyst Edward Mally. For 1990, Reliance postedearnings of $48 million on sales of $1.55 billion. Thecompany had operating profit, or earnings before interest andtaxes, of $185 million and long-term debt of $618 million.   Investment bankers say Reliance might be valued at eightto nine times operating profit, adjusted for debt andpreferred stock. That would put a value of about $350 millionto $400 million or more on Citicorp's stake. Nearly all thoseproceeds would be booked as a gain for Citicorp, whichacquired its stake in 1986 for less than $10 million.   Citicorp had been an active sponsor of leveraged buy-outsin the mid-1980s and scored some big gains on its equityinvestments in buy-out companies. Current winners, aside fromReliance, include a minority stake in York International. ButCiticorp also holds equity in some buy-out companies thathave run into trouble coping with their big debt loads, suchas Morse Shoe Inc., Papercraft Corp. and LeasewayTransportation Co. Those equity positions are likely to be oflittle value.</TEXT></DOC>
