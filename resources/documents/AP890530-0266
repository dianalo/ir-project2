Analysts said a strong U.S. dollar and expectations for more ofthe wet weather that touched key growing areas over the recentthree-day holiday weekend affected prices.   Traders, coming off last week's life-of-contract lows, began theday on the defensive after weekend rain was reported in both cornand soybean regions, and wheat opened lower in sympathy.   In general, the closer to delivery a contract was in each of thethree markets, the better it fared. Only July soybeans managed toclose with a gain.   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 3{ cents lower, with thecontract for delivery in July at $3.91{ a bushel; corn was 2{ centsto 6{ cents lower, with July at $2.61} a bushel; oats were 3{ centsto 4} cents lower, with July at $1.65\ cents a bushel; and soybeanswere 7 cents higher to 19 cents lower, with July at $7.18 a bushel. Europe.   ``I think it's a good thing,'' the president said. ``It's goodfor NATO. I happen to think it's good for the entire free world.''   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the summit paved the wayfor ``a historic chance for realistic and significant arms controlprogress.''   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Kohl's main Europeanantagonist in the missile flap, said she was ``very, verysatisfied'' with the agreement on short-range missiles. It was, shesaid, a ``pretty tight document.''   French President Francois Mitterrand described the meeting'sresults as ``very positive.'' And Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's primeminister, said, ``European unity is reaffirmed.''   The Germans entered the summit demanding immediate negotiationswith the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact to reduce short-range nuclearmissiles in Europe.   U.S. and British officials said attention should be focusedfirst on slashing the East's enormous superiority in conventionalarms in newly opened talks in Vienna between NATO and the WarsawPact.   They also worried that entering into those negotiations wouldinevitably lead to outright elimination of the missiles, known inmilitary jargon as the ``third zero.'' NATO contends it needs anuclear arsenal to offset the East's massive conventional force.   After discussions lasting until early Tuesday, NATO foreignministers fashioned a compromise.   The allies said they would ``make every effort'' to bring theVienna talks ``to an early and satisfactory conclusion,'' possiblywithin six months to a year.   Once implementation of such an accord has begun, the UnitedStates ``is prepared to enter into negotiations to achieve apartial reduction'' of short-range nuclear missiles to equallevels. The word ``partial'' was underlined.   ``There will be no `third zero.' Partial means partial,'' Bushinsisted at a news conference.   The leaders also said reductions in short-range missiles ``willnot be carried out until the results of these (conventional)negotiations have been implemented.''   They agreed that the troublesome question of deploying a new,more powerful generation of surface-to-surface nuclear missiles``will be dealt with in 1992 in the light of overall securitydevelopments.''   They said they ``recognize the value'' of the American effort todevelop a replacement to the aging Lance missile. The weapon wasintroduced in 1972, and military analysts say it will becomeobsolete in 1995.   The United States wanted a strong endorsement from the alliesfor its development program. Kohl, worried about the survival ofhis center-right government, wanted to delay a decision onproduction of the missile until after important elections next yearin Germany.   The leaders reaffirmed that their strategy for deterrence wasbased on a mix of ``adequate and effective nuclear and conventionalforces.''   ``Where nuclear forces are concerned, land-, sea- and air-basedsystems, including ground-based missiles, in the presentcircumstances and as far as can be foreseen will be needed inEurope,'' they said.   Overshadowed by the arms control push was a set of guidelinesfor encouraging the enormous changes under way in the Soviet Unionand Eastern Europe.   ``We welcome the current reforms that have already led togreater openness, improved respect for human rights, activeparticipation of the individual, and new attitudes in foreignpolicy,'' the leaders said in a separate statement. ``But muchremains to be done.''   They called on the East to tear down the physical and politicalwalls separating Europeans, simplify border crossings and allow thefree movement of people and information.   The NATO allies said they will try to increase contacts amongindividuals in the East and West and seek more economic and tradeties.</TEXT></DOC>
