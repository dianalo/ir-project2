World Population Chart _ 1988.''   ``The populations of Asia and Latin America are growing moremoderately than Africa's, and of course in many countries in Europethe population growth is almost stationary,'' said Rafeeuddin Ahmad,the undersecretary-general who presented the report at a newsconference.   ``Each woman in the world has, on the average, 3.4 children. .. .The number for Africa is 6.2 and it is around 3.5 in Latin Americaand Asia.
