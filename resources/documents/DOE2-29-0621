These diagnostics provide high resolution time-resolved measurementsof relativistic electron beams such as the diameter and displacement,and with proper analysis, yield moments of the distribution for radialprofiles. These modern diagnostics can be configured into high-speed,gated video cameras, x-ray framing cameras, streak cameras, and opticalscanners for digitizing images from film. While the video signal formatof these cameras may be different (RS170, CCIR, interlaced, noninterlaced...),the use of these diagnostics can be greatly facilitated by using a singleinterface for all of the cameras.</TEXT></DOC>
