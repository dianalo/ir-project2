(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge today denied thegovernment's request for a stay of his order requiring the Officeof Thrift Supervision to return control of Franklin SavingsAssociation to its former officers.   The denial by Judge Dale E. Saffels sent government attorneys tothe 10th U.S. Circuit Court in Denver seeking to override Saffelsand get an order that would keep Franklin under federal management.   The government was fighting a deadline Saffels set Wednesday forturning Franklin over to its former managers.   Franklin's chief counsel, Roger Stanton, said the savingsassociation had its attorneys ready in Denver to file a responseopposing a similar motion there. He said 10th Circuit rules do notprovide for a hearing on such a motion.   OTS seized control of Franklin, based in Ottawa, Kan., and thestate's largest thrift, last February in a dispute over whether itwas being managed prudently. It placed Franklin under management ofthe Resolution Trust Corp. as conservator.   Franklin's officers sued to regain control of the thrift, andSaffels held in a 93-page opinion made public Wednesday that thegovernment seizure was arbitrary and capricious.   He ordered the government to remove the RTC as conservator ofFranklin and to turn over management reins today to the thrift'schairman, Ernest W. Fleischer.   However, OTS attorneys filed a motion Wednesday night for a stayof judgment, seeking to keep Franklin in the hands of the RTC whilethe government appeals Saffels' decision.   Saffels said the OTS ``has not demonstrated either a stronglikelihood of success on the merits on appeal, or that it wouldsuffer irreparable harm if a stay were not issued.''   The judge, ruling on the stay motion without a hearing, said astay would be ``contrary to the public interest.''   Harris Weinstein, chief OTS counsel in Washington, said lateWednesday the federal agency would appeal to the 10th Circuitseeking a stay if Saffels denied its motion.   In his order, Saffels found that the OTS decision to takecontrol of Franklin ``lacked any basis in fact.''   Weinstein disagreed strongly.   ``We firmly believe the government acted in a timely and propermanner in taking over Franklin, an institution that was beingoperated with insufficient capital and in an unsafe and unsoundmanner,'' Weinstein said in a statement issued in Washington.   ``OTS continues to believe that prior to the conservatorshiporder, Franklin was placing excessive reliance on high-risk assetsfinanced by high-cost and mobile brokered deposits, and that at thesame time Franklin used improper accounting methods under which itrecognized gains and deferred losses while distributing more than$45 million of the institution's funds in dividends to theshareholders.''   Saffels also retained jurisdiction in the case for the next 90days, meaning that the OTS cannot appoint another conservator orattempt to place Franklin in receivership during that time withouthis approval.   Saffels told reporters that after 90 days, the OTS could moveagainst Franklin again. That could mean more court hearings, hesaid, ``and we'd probably start over again.''   The ruling was not expected to have any direct impact on othersavings and loan litigation.   At issue in this case was whether OTS was justified in seizingcontrol of the $11 billion thrift on Feb. 16 for allegedly losingmillions in the futures market but deferring those losses forbookkeeping purposes by using a controversial hedging accountingsystem.   Franklin officials, headed by Fleischer, sued the government onMarch 12, contending the government had insufficient evidence oflosses, management problems or improper accounting procedures totake over the thrift.   Saffels declared in his lengthy opinion that ``no statutoryground for the imposition of a conservatorship existed.''   ``This was not a case of improper or retroactive rule-making,but one of erroneous application of existing regulatory rules,'' hewrote. ``The facts of this case clearly show that the regulatoracted wrongly in imposing the conservatorship. This court mustcorrect that wrongful action.''   The judge went out of his way to distinguish the Franklin casefrom others being prosecuted around the country by OTS.   ``This is not a case involving an infamous or notorious savingsand loan association, the likes of which the public has recentlybecome more than familiar,'' Saffels wrote.   ``This is not a case involving fraud, corruption or self-dealingby the management or directors of Franklin. There has been noallegation or even hint of illegal or unethical conduct byFranklin's management or directors.   ``Essentially, this case boils down to a dispute over accountingpractices,'' he wrote.   Fleischer, who was in Saffels' courtroom when the ruling wasreleased, said he was ``very pleased with the decision and the carewith which the decision was written.''</TEXT></DOC>
