State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the fundswould be given to a commission comprised of United Nations andOrganization of American States officials. The commission, known byits Spanish initials, CIAV, was set up partly to oversee thedismantling of the Contras, most of whom are based in Honduras.   ``We have explained our intentions to the government of Hondurasand the Nicaraguan resistance,'' Boucher said. ``Both have reactedfavorably. The UN and OAS secretaries general have also beeninformed.''   The commission, Boucher said, will be asked to submit proposalsfor use of the funds.   The disclosure was part of what appears to be an increase indiplomatic activity concerning the fate of the rebels as Nicaraguanelections draw closer. The Feb. 25 election in Nicaragua will matchPresident Daniel Ortega against an opposition coalition led bypresidential candidate Violeta Chamorro.   Sources close to the Sandinista government said Nicaraguanofficials would meet Saturday with Contra representatives inTegucigalpa. CIAV officials also will attend.   Amnesty for rebels willing to return in peace to Nicaragua willbe discussed, sources said.   In addition, State Department officials are expected to conferwith CIAV officials at an undetermined location next week on thepeace process.   Most of the Contras are at camps in southern Honduras. The fiveCentral American presidents have called for the demobilization ofthe Contras but the rebels, with U.S. support, have said theyshould remain intact until after next month's elections.   Boucher's announcement of a conditional U.S. commitment to fundthe demobilization of the Contras was in response to a communiqueapproved by the five Central American presidents last month.   According to some interpretations, the communique required theimmediate transfer of all U.S. aid funds for the Contras to theCIAV. However, the State Department disputes that interpretationand says it has gone beyond the requirements of the communique.   U.S. aid to the rebels consists of food, clothing, shelter andmedical services and is due to run out at the end of February.   The Sandinistas have given high priority to promoting thedismantling of the Contras, but the rebels have insisted that mustbe voluntary and in the context of a free and fair electoralprocess in Nicaragua.   The biggest setback occurred in early November when theSandinistas, contending that the rebels engaged in terroristactivities, suspended a cease-fire that had been in effectinformally with the Contras for the preceding 19 months.   Nine days of talks between the Sandinistas and the Contras aimedat restoring the cease-fire ended in failure Nov. 21.</TEXT></DOC>
