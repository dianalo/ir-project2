He met with Andreas Papandreou, the former Socialist premier,and Communist leader Harilaos Florakis. Since the Nov. 5 elections,each has failed in a separate effort to form a coalition with amajority in the 300-set Parliament.   None of the three indicated whether progress was ade on Friday.   If the three leaders cannot get together, President ChristosSartzetakis is expected to call another election.   Police meanwhile fought running battles Friday in central Athenswith youths who rioted on the fringes of a march commemorating astudent uprising Nov. 17, 1973.   Three riot policemen and a reporter were slightly injured bystones thrown by about 200 rioters who firebombed a police bus, adepartment store and the entrance of an apartment block.   More than 20 young people were killed in the revolt at theAthens Polytechnic. The military regime collapsed in 1974 afterseven years in power.   During Friday's melee, the rioters built burning roadblocks andsmashed the windows of six banks. Police said no one was arrested.   Political observers believe the results of the next electionwould be the same: no one party would win enough seats in the300-member Parliament to govern alone.   In the Nov. 5 balloting, New Democracy took 148 seats, threeshort of an absolute majority, Papandreou's Panhellenic SocialistMovement won 128 and the Coalition garnered 21. Two independentsand an environmentalist took the remaining three seats.   On June 18, elections also failed to produce a winner. Aconservative-communist government led the country until theNovember elections.   All three political leaders have said they want to avoid newelections but differ on its goals and duration.   Mitsotakis and Florakis said they favor an all-party governmentthat would govern until March when presidential elections will makeanother poll mandatory if no candidate receives at least 180 votesin Parliament.   According to the constitution, new elections are called ifParliament fails to choose a President. The newly electedParliament can then pick a president with a simple majority vote.   Papandreou agrees with Florakis the electoral system should bereplaced by simple proportional representation, but Mitsotakis sayssuch a change would create unstable governments.   The three parties are also divided over negotiations with theUnited States on the continued presence of their militaryinstallations in the country. A U.S.-Greek defense accord expiredin December.   Despite 17 rounds of negotiations with a PASOK government beforeit failed to be re-elected in June after eight years in office, thebases issue remains unsolved.   Papandreou said he wants one more round of negotiations beforethe draft agreement is put to a national referendum. Thecommunist-led coalition said it would support an all-partygovernment only if the U.S. bases were shut down while Mitsotakissaid retaining the bases is vital to Greece's security.</TEXT></DOC>
