So, in a sense, a little bad news mighthelp.   Nearly 58,000 unionized machinists struck the company this pastweek after contract negotiations collapsed. The workers want agreater share of Boeing's record profits and less mandatoryovertime, which has kept many toiling seven days a week to fillstaggering order backlogs.   On first glance, the strike came at a bad time for theSeattle-based company, which dominates the commercial airplanemarket despite intense competition from McDonnell Douglas andEurope's Airbus Industrie.   Domestic and foreign airlines ordered more than 700 planes thisyear from Boeing, stretching back-orders to more than 1,600aircraft worth $80 billion, delaying deliveries by months andirritating customers who had been counting on those planes tomodernize aging fleets.   Of particular concern to buyers and Boeing management is thecompany's commitment to deliver 57 of its new 747-400 jumbo jets byyearend. Before the strike, Boeing officials had ordered assemblylines to turn out an unprecedented 27 of the big planes just in thelast three months of the year.   The strike will almost certainly disrupt that acceleratedschedule, which could cost Boeing late-delivery penalties andnarrow the profit it makes on the new planes. A few importantclients have even dropped hints they want to renegotiate existingorders or even shop elsewhere.   The International Association of Machinists has hoped to exploitthis pressure on Boeing to make the company capitulate, in whatlabor leaders are calling one of the most importantunion-management struggles of the decade.   But some analysts say the strike could actually help the companyand backfire on the Machinists, a militant and powerful union thathistorically has enjoyed enormous influence in the aerospaceindustry.   For one thing, the walkout provides a reasonable excuse fordelivery delays, since it's unlikely customers are going to demandairplanes assembled by strike replacements or foremen.   For another, Boeing had maintained such a relentless productionagenda that many of its parts suppliers had failed to keep pace, sothe walkout gives them an opportunity to catch up.   But perhaps the most important reason the strike may not hurtBoeing is the nature of the commercial airplane business itself,built on longstanding relationships between airlines and aircraftmakers. Buyers cannot simply repudiate multibillion-dollarcontracts that stretch over periods of years.   Even if they could, they may have nowhere else to go to buy theairplanes they need. Boeing's competitors face many of the sameorder-backlog problems that Boeing has.   McDonnell Douglas, for example, has doubled its work force inthe past two years to satisfy growing demand for new planes, butthe company's productivity has dropped because the new employeesare so inexperienced.   At Airbus, where production is expected to double within fouryears, officials have acknowledged a similar productivity problem.The 20-year-old four-company consortium also faces pressure fromEuropean governments tired of subsidizing its money-losingoperations.   Of course, the Boeing strike outcome depends partly on how longthe walkout lasts. Strikers have a $90 million fund that will paythem $100 a week after the third week, so they won't deplete thatmoney for more than three months.   They also may get financial help from other forces in organizedlabor, which seem to be targeting Boeing to regain some of theground lost over the 1980s to other blue-collar employers in thiscountry.   ``The unions have shown that they can no longer deliver higherwages or increased job security even in the highest-payingindustries _ the airlines, the auto companies, steel and regulatedpublic utilities,'' said Daniel Lacey, a Cleveland-based consultantwho tracks labor trends.   ``Aerospace is the last high-paying target industry they haveleft, so organized labor just can't afford to lose at Boeing.''
