Industry studies by plant owners and reactor vendors supportedthe conclusion that improvements were needed to help operators diagnosethe approach to or existence of ICC and to provide more complete informationfor operator control of safety injection, flow to minimize the consequencesof such an accident. In 1980, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)required further studies by the industry and described ICC instrumentationdesign requirements that included human factors and environmental considerations.On December 10, 1982, NRC issued to Babcock andamp; Wilcox (Bandamp;W) licensees'orders for Modification of License and transmitted to all pressurizedwater reactor (PWR) licensees Generic Letter 82-28 to inform them ofthe revised NRC requirements. The instrumentation requirements for detectionof ICC include upgraded subcooling margin monitors (SMMs), upgraded coreexit thermocouples (CETs), and installation of a reactor coolant inventorytracking system (RCITS).</TEXT></DOC>
