Walsh is on the job, looking into who did what, when in order to sell arms to Iran at prices inflated to benefit the contras. Before Mr. Walsh recommends any indictments, however, it will be interesting to see if the subject of the U.S. Constitution comes up in his investigations. A prudent prosecutor thinks twice about indicting people who've broken no constitutional laws.    The Iran-arms/contra affair raises the issue of whether Congress can legitimately pass laws to constrain the president from defending the nation. The Constitution, Supreme Court interpretation and past practice all suggest that Congress's legal restraints on the president in the field of foreign policy -- from the War Powers Resolution of 1973 to the Boland Amendments -- violate the separation of powers.    The text of the Constitution establishes the president's unique role in foreign affairs. Article II, section 1 grants the president all the &quot;executive power&quot; of a nation. Article II, section 2 is more specific, making the president the &quot;commander in chief&quot; of the armed forces. Article II, section 3 grants him the power to execute the laws, which includes discretion in interpreting the meaning of laws. There are also broad foreign-policy powers that are inherently granted to the executive because they are not granted to Congress.    The Founding Fathers concluded there was no alternative to a strong executive after they saw how difficult it was to defend the colonies under the Articles of Confederation of 1777, which had given Congress the upper hand in foreign policy. Neither the states nor Congress could run an effective foreign policy. In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton warned the House could play only a minor role because &quot;decision, secrecy and dispatch are incompatible with the genius of a body so variable and so numerous.&quot; He added that &quot;it is vain to impose constitutional barriers to the impulse of self-preservation.&quot;    The Founders, as practical men, understood that no country could have 535 foreign policies or commanders in chief. In 1800, Rep. (later Chief Justice) John Marshall told his House colleagues that the president is &quot;sole organ of the nation in its external relations, and its sole representative with foreign nations.&quot;    The Supreme Court has had little difficulty establishing executive authority in the few cases it has considered. The leading case was U.S. vs. Curtiss-Wright Export Co. (1936), which recognized FDR's broad power to ban the sales of weapons to warring countries in South America. The court found a &quot;very delicate, plenary and exclusive power of the president as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations.&quot;    The similarity of the facts of Curtiss-Wright with the contra issue is not entirely coincidental. It takes an extraordinary issue, such as whether to help arm foreign troops, to get a case into court. Individual U.S. citizens must be accused of breaking the law for judges to conclude that the issue isn't just one for the political branches to fight out between themselves. The current controversy is another rare incident that could lead to court review of legislation.    If any of the key players in this affair are charged with violating federal laws, a defense lawyer might argue: &quot;My client has broken no constitutional law. Any laws that were broken sending arms to Iran or diverting funds to the contras were unconstitutional laws. Congress cannot usurp the authority over foreign affairs that the Founders gave the executive branch, which my client represented.&quot;    Potential charges against Oliver North, John Poindexter or others raise the possibility of a landmark ruling on separation of powers in the field of foreign affairs. The high court has been forced to settle some other nettlesome checks-and-balances issues involving congressional overstepping in recent terms. The Chadha case invalidated the legislative veto, upsetting hundreds of bills. This past term, the Supreme Court voided the automatic budget-cutting provisions of Gramm-Rudman as a legislative usurpation of presidential authority. As with the foreign-policy restraints, these cases involved bills passed over the objection of the president.    A review by the courts of checks and balances in foreign policy is overdue. The War Powers Resolution, passed over President Nixon's veto, requires that troops be withdrawn within 60 days unless Congress acts to authorize the deployment. The 1980 Intelligence Oversight Act requires that congressional committees be &quot;fully and currently informed&quot; of intelligence activities. The Boland Amendments of 1983, '84 and '85 prohibited using funds for &quot;supporting, directly or indirectly, military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua.&quot;    Past practice shows that when Congress tries to constrain the president in matters of national security, the president's policy prevails. The nearby list describes the 137 occasions when the president sent troops or arms without congressional approval -- indeed, often despite congressional prohibition (see related story: &quot;137 Cases of Executive Action&quot; -- WSJ Jan. 15, 1987). The incidents are culled from State Department and congressional reports on uses of force and arms transfers published through 1970. President Ford's response to the Mayaguez seizure, President Carter's attempt to rescue the Iranian hostages, and President Reagan's liberation of Grenada and attack on Libya show that the executive branch continues to claim and practice such authority.    The president had sent troops or arms abroad 199 times as of 1970 without Congress declaring war, which has happened only five times. In 62 of these cases of non-declared war, Congress had consented to the president's action by appropriating funds, passing resolutions or by the Senate having ratified a treaty that empowered the president to act. So two-thirds of the time -- 137 of 199 cases -- the president acted without authorization by Congress.    The highlights: President Jefferson pursued the Barbary pirates. President Wilson armed the merchant marine before World War I despite the failure of Congress to authorize funding. FDR sent 50 ships to Britain in exchange for naval bases despite congressional resistance to entry into World War II. President Kennedy acted on his own to quarantine Cuba.    Any defendants in cases arising from the Iran/contra affair will have one hurdle before claiming executive power. President Reagan has distanced himself from the operations, saying he didn't authorize his staff to take the steps it did. The separation-of-powers issue would be more clearly drawn if Mr. Reagan had said his staff was carrying out the orders of the commander-in-chief, that any violations of law were within the authority of the executive but taken without authorization.    The defendants could argue, however, that their actions were in pursuit of the executive policies of looking for post-Khomeini moderates, freeing hostages and getting arms to the contras until Congress joined this policy by authorizing $100 million in aid. The only difference, they could argue, was the means, not the ends.    These issues may not reach the courts, especially if immunity is granted. But one troubling point will not go away. The same Constitution can't give Presidents Wilson and Roosevelt the power to get the country into world wars while at the same time deny today's executive branch the right to send TOW missiles to Iran and funding to the contras.    ---   Mr. Crovitz is assistant editor of the Journal's editorial page. </TEXT></DOC>
