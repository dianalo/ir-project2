During an annual ceremony at the steep river bank, PatriarchDiodoros I was surrounded by about 300 pilgrims, most of themPalestinian and Greek women. Many held plastic and glass bottles tobe filled with blessed river water.   About a dozen Israeli soldiers armed with submachine guns guardedthe pilgrims as they made their way along barbed wire fences andmine fields to the river bank.   Attendance has dropped by about 80 percent since the beginning ofthe Palestinian uprising in December 1987, said Father Innocent, aGreek Orthodox priest. ``People are simply scared,'' he said.   The Jordan River has served as a cease-fire line since the 1967Middle East war when Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan.Shortly after the war, Israel closed the river bank to visitorsbecause of shelling by Palestinian guerrillas.   Israel first allowed Eastern Orthodox denominations to return fortheir annual baptism ceremony in 1981. Roman Catholics, who hold aceremony nearby in October, followed in 1985.   ``The border makes me feel worried,'' said Chris Kalivas, a truckdriver from Athens. ``This is not what I had imagined,'' he added,pointing at the barren desert lining the 60-foot-wide river.   ``Everything looks so desolate,'' added Stefan Durst, a Lutheranpastor from Hamburg, West Germany. Durst said he came out ofprofessional curiosity.   Other pilgrims were more cheerful.   ``I'm not scared. We've come here to pray to Jesus,'' saidShahira Mahle, 18, who came with a group of 50 Israeli Arab pilgrimsfrom the northern Israeli town of Nazareth.   Also among the pilgrims were Russian and Romanian nuns in blackhabits and black cone-shaped velvet caps.   The three-hour ceremony began with the reading of psalms andscriptures in Greek and Arabic at St. John's Monastery.   The site, along with other monasteries near the river, wasabandoned in 1970 after a Romanian monk was killed by Palestinianguerrillas, said Shmuel Hamburger of the West Bank's militarygovernment.   After the prayers, the patriarch led a procession of 40 chantingpriests in black and gold robes to the river bank.   Diodoros then hurled the cross, tied to a rope and wrapped in abunch of basil, into the murky river. The two white doves releasedby the patriarch fluttered over the river before settling among thereeds at the water's edge.</TEXT></DOC>
