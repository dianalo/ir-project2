An uncontrolled border, such as the Journal advocates, would cause chaos in the U.S. Our nation's vibrant economy can absorb and utilize productively large numbers of entrants, but the flow must be orderly and controlled. An open border is, by its terms, neither orderly nor controlled.    An open border poses real dangers to our national security. Not all people who would come across an unpatrolled, unguarded border are nice people who wish us well and only want a job. Some are smugglers with drugs to deal, some are terrorists, and some are spies seeking to subvert our government. However, a closed border could be as destructive and senseless as an open border. It would deprive the U.S. of the renewal, enrichment and new vigor that immigrants and refugees bring, and it would make America insular, provincial and unproductive.    If neither an open nor a closed border is the answer, then what is? The answer is to close the back door and keep the front door open. Curtail the &quot;back door&quot; flow of illegal aliens and maintain a generous &quot;front door&quot; flow of legal immigrants, refugees and temporary foreign workers. The Simpson-Rodino-Mazzoli Act, which controls illegal entry through a combination of increased surveillance at the borders and document-checking at the work place, closes the back door. And it opens the front door by establishing a very generous legalization program for the illegal workers who have lived in the U.S. for many years, creating a new program to legalize agricultural workers, and expanding and modernizing an existing temporary foreign-worker program.    From another perspective, the Simpson-Rodino-Mazzoli Act eases the frustrations and the nativist backlash that grew in the U.S. during recent years in the face of uncontrolled illegal entry. As a result, the national climate now has improved markedly and is more congenial to opening the front door even wider. In this connection, the Subcommittee on Immigration, which I am privileged to chair, will conduct hearings later this year and next on improving and expanding the laws governing legal entry into the U.S.    The most effective immigration policy won't do the job unless the people in our neighboring countries have a full opportunity to earn a living and raise a family in their native land. Essential to any immigration reform are steps to ensure peace and stability, political freedom and economic opportunity in the developing nations of our hemisphere. The International Migration Commission, formed under the auspices of our bill, has begun its three-year deliberations that will lead to exactly such policy recommendations.    Romano L. Mazzoli, (D., Ky.)   U.S. House of Representatives   Chairman   Subcommittee on Immigration,   Refugees and International Law    Washington</TEXT></DOC>
