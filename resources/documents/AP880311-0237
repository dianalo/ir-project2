Nine people died in the attack, including five of the 11hijackers.   The reports included dirt on the musical family from Siberia anddescribed in detail how they were duped into thinking they hadlanded in Finland.   Even under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign forglasnost, or openness, the reports offered a rare account of an actof terrorism in the Soviet Union.   The hijackers were all members of the Ovechkin family, aSiberian jazz ensemble from Irkutsk that went by the name ``SevenSimeons.''   Armed with a bomb and shotguns, they boarded the Leningrad-boundTupolev-154 in Irkutsk, and after a refueling stop in Kurgandemanded that they be taken to London, the newspapers said.   But the pilot set the plane down on a small airfield nearLeningrad. Five of the hijackers, including the ``hero-mother,''described as the ringleader, three passengers and a stewardess werekilled in an ensuing shootout.   The newspapers covering the story didn't rely on dispatches fromthe official news agency Tass; they assigned their owncorrespondents.   Trud said the group, which was named after a Russian fairy taleabout a large family of farmers, was a hit in Irkutsk and wasgaining popularity nationwide.   The ensemble visited Japan in November. Their pictures appearedin the local press frequently and they were the subject of adocumentary film.   The group had been scheduled to play a concert March 4-6 inIrkutsk, but canceled because one of the brothers was ill,according to Trud. The real reason for the cancellation, the papersuggested, was that they were preparing to flee the country.   ``At that time they were selling all their household goods,''Trud reported.   Pravda said the trip to Japan swelled their heads.   ``The boundless praise apparently made their heads spin; theOvechkins began to dream about the `good life' abroad,'' it said,without citing a source.   It said the family members had everything going for them. Theyhad jobs and profited nicely from a private farm plot. But Pravdasaid there was a dark side.   The mother, Ninel Ovechkin, continued to deal in vodka, evenafter her husband died a few years ago from excessive drinking.   The media reports indicated that Mrs. Ovechkin, described as aplump, well-dressed woman of over 50, had at least 11 children.   Before setting out for the Irkutsk airport, the Ovechkins left anote on their apartment door saying they were going to anotherSiberian city and would return Friday, according to Pravda.   All members of the family but the eldest sister boarded theflight, Trud said.   They carried only hand baggage, mainly musical instruments,according to Pravda. Everything was searched except for the stringbass, which wouldn't fit in the X-ray machine, Pravda said. TheOvechkins refused to allow the bass to be checked into the baggagecompartment, and nothing suspicious was found in a visualinspection, Pravda said.   Tass said Thursday the weapons used in the hijacking had beensmuggled aboard the plane in the instruments.      The newspapers portrayed stewardess Tamara Zharkaya as a martyrwho negotiated calmly with the hijackers, who were armed with16-gauge, sawed-off shotguns.      ``This girl took a tremendous responsibility upon herself,''Pravda said. ``She succeeded in psychological victory over thebandits.''   Sovietskaya Rossiya quoted Pilot First Class Valentin Kupriyanovas saying the crew decided to accept the demand because thehijackers were becoming dangerous.   ``To avoid placing the passengers at risk, we decided to fulfillthe demands of the bandits and fly abroad,'' Kupriyanov recalled.``The ground (flight controllers) approved our action. But thecloser we got to Leningrad, the clearer it became that we would notreach even nearby Finnish or Swedish airports.''   Izvestia said the flight crew contacted the ground, and a planwas worked out to dupe the hijackers into thinking they werelanding in Finland.   An assault team was waiting when the Tu-154 touched down, mediasaid.   The attack was over in minutes.</TEXT></DOC>
