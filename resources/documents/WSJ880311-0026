American officials say that after the rioting in Armenia and Azerbaijan, which they estimate left 100 or more dead, there are as many as 35 other flashpoints where ethnic grievances against the Russian-dominated leadership threaten to erupt. Kremlin hardliners fear a new round of unrest in Eastern Europe if Gorbachev doesn't convincingly set down disturbances within the country.    The troubles couldn't come at a worse time for Gorbachev; he is struggling to consolidate his power ahead of a June party conference, and can't afford to show more weakness when Moscow is already hoping to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan.    &quot;The situation is broiling, and I think he's sitting on a powderkeg,&quot; says Rand Corp. Kremlinologist Jeremy Azrael.    CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL of some Contra aid seems more likely.    Chances grow that the bipartisan group of senators pushing Contra aid will force the House to go along. Their package, to be unveiled next week, calls for $30 million to $36 million of aid, excludes arms and guarantees Reagan a later vote on military aid. Sponsors believe their plan will avoid the unusual liberal-conservative coalition that beat Speaker Wright's proposal.    Passage won't derail GOP efforts to make the Contras an election issue, Republican strategists say: They will target Democrats in Spanish-speaking areas, such as Florida Rep. Lehman. But Democrats say the issue will probably hurt pro-Contra Republicans more. A case in point: GOP Rep. Miller's Seattle-area district, where anti-Contra sentiment runs high.    MONEY MATTERS shape the next phase of the Democratic conflict.    Gore fund-raiser Nathan Landow says he got $50,000 in pledges on Wednesday and will raise $100,000 more at a 40th-birthday party for the candidate later this month. But Gore faces contests over the next six weeks in such inordinately costly media markets as Illinois, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania, and pros doubt he can match Dukakis.    Dukakis, emerging from Super Tuesday with a healthy surplus, eschews negative ads for now. But aides paint Gore as a regional candidate. One asks, &quot;Where is that guy going to win north of the Mason-Dixon line?&quot; Jackson steps up direct-mail money efforts and adds more fund-raisers, seeking cash to buy Chicago TV commercials before the Illinois primary.    On the GOP side, federal election commissioners plan to seek an injunction if Robertson tries to avoid spending limits by returning his federal funds.    RETURN OF THE NATIVE? Some Democrats lobby for the return to Dukakis' campaign of John Sasso, who quit after being fingered for leaking anti-Biden tapes last fall. He wouldn't replace current campaign chief Susan Estrich, who has won high marks. But longtime aide Sasso is one person the often-stubborn Dukakis listens to.    BRIGHT FUTURE? Some GOP politicians figure that Jack Kemp, who dropped out of the presidential race yesterday, will remain an important political player, even though it is unlikely he would be Bush's running mate. They say that if the Democrats win the White House this year, the 52-year-old Kemp immediately becomes a front runner for 1992.    CHANGE OF HEART: CBS News, which had been feuding with Bush, gave him &quot;totally positive&quot; coverage the week before Super Tuesday, according to the Conference on Issues and Media Inc., which measures TV coverage. &quot;Something has changed at CBS,&quot; suggests John Merriam, the firm's president. The group says Gephardt got the most negative coverage on all three networks.    BLUE-COLLAR BLUES afflicted Dukakis in several Southern states, according to NBC News exit polls. He won just 7% of blue-collar Democrats in Alabama, 12% in Louisiana, 16% in North Carolina. But the NBC polls show he did far better in Texas, where Dukakis, who speaks Spanish, won over half the Hispanic vote.    CONFLICTING GOALS mark U.S. policy toward South Korea.    Prodded by Congress and public opinion, the administration increases economic pressure on Korea's new government. Treasury Secretary Baker, at Roh Tae Woo's inaugural, pressed for a rise in the value of Korea's currency. Trade representative Yeutter warns that the U.S. won't back off its push for trade-barrier reductions.    But some State Department officials believe the pressure is too public, fueling anti-Americanism and putting Washington's friend Roh on the spot ahead of his first parliamentary elections. They say Roh must resist U.S. pressure now or be branded as Washington's lackey. They predict he will offer the U.S. concessions after the April elections, but not before.    Aides to the chief of Samsung Group scramble to assuage administration anger over his suggestion that U.S. pressure might endanger Korean interest payments to American banks.    MINOR MEMOS: Urging Democrat-turned-Republican John Connally to return to his former party, Jackson places his hand on Connally's head and intones, &quot;Heal.&quot; . . . Cuomo may run after all. Andrew Cuomo, that is: The governor's 30-year-old son considers a race against GOP Rep. DioGuardi. . . . After Rep. Dornan delivers an energetic denunciation of the Sandinistas on the House floor, Rep. Obey offers to &quot;help get him a sedative.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
