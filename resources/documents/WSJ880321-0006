Rundle (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> TNM INS </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   California lawmakers are racing to pass a bill intended to keep troubled Blue Cross of California, the state's largest health insurer and one of the largest nonprofit insurers in the U.S., from technical insolvency.    Many individuals and small businesses in the state who can't get coverage elsewhere depend on Blue Cross for their health insurance.    The legislation would clear the way for Blue Cross to sell its TakeCare affiliate for about $45 million. TakeCare, an Oakland, Calif.-based health maintenance organization with about 155,000 members, had 1986 revenue of $117 million. Blue Cross needs the special legislation, because there isn't any provision in insurance regulations to convert the nonprofit affiliate into a for-profit concern.    Despite some recent improvement in its financial condition, Blue Cross is telling lawmakers that it must sell TakeCare soon to meet certain regulatory requirements of the state insurance department. State Sen. Barry Keene wrote the bill to protect the consumers who are dependent on Blue Cross for health insurance, an aide said.    Blue Cross &quot;could be technically insolvent -- that's why we've asked (Sen. Keene) to carry this as an urgency bill,&quot; said Angele Khachadour, Blue Cross general counsel. When a company becomes insolvent, &quot;the department of insurance is required to put it into conservatorship,&quot; she said.    Insurers must maintain a statutory surplus of more than $20,000. At the end of 1987, Blue Cross had a surplus -- assets minus liabilities -- of about $25 million. But it has had underwriting losses of $300 million in the past two years, and expects to report a further loss for the first quarter.    Leonard D. Schaeffer, Blue Cross president, said the TakeCare sale is &quot;vital&quot; and &quot;a bridge to the second half, when we expect underwriting results to be better.&quot; He said the insurer's financial woes are well known, but declined to comment on what would happen if the TakeCare sale isn't completed. The statutory requirements don't affect Blue Cross's ability to pay claims, he said.    After several successive quarters of narrowing losses, first-period losses have worsened because of seasonal factors, Mr. Schaeffer said. Blue Cross is on target with a turnaround plan it put into place last August, he said. Last year, the insurer had underwriting losses of $152.8 million, compared with $148.4 million in 1986. Blue Cross had 1987 revenue of about $2 billion.    After passing the lower house 66-10 Thursday, the Blue Cross measure is headed toward quick approval in the Senate. Gov. George Deukmejian is widely expected to sign the bill, but hasn't announced his intentions. The measure would take effect immediately because of its urgency status.    Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports, is the only opponent. Consumers Union argues that any special law that gives Blue Cross the assets from a TakeCare sale should include guidelines on how the funds are used. For example, Blue Cross might be required to make health coverage available at affordable rates to employees of small businesses, Consumers Union has suggested.    Blue Cross, with nearly three million members, is one of the largest of the 77 Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in the country. Each of the plans is autonomous, but pays dues to the national association in Chicago. Last year, the plans collectively had losses of more than $1 billion, a spokeswoman said. Since the first plan was founded in 1929, however, none has ever been declared insolvent. </TEXT></DOC>
