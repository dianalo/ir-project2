But then Cargill learned what was really behind the intense opposition among farmers and government officials that was blocking its efforts to build a feed mill in this small seaport town: Nokyo, the powerful farmers' cooperative.    That's because the Minneapolis company's entry threatened the regional cooperative's own lucrative feed business, part of a string of businesses in the area that take in annual revenue of $2.87 billion. &quot;We would have to fight for market share and lower prices,&quot; says Iwao Nishimura, a Nokyo offical in charge of fighting off Cargill's challenge. &quot;We also have to survive,&quot; he says.    To get permission to build the mill, Cargill had to call in the U.S. trade representative to put pressure on the government, and then agree not to undersell Nokyo and other Japanese feed producers.    Indeed, understanding the powerful Nokyo, with its influence over the government, consumer groups and other opinion makers, goes a long way toward understanding Japanese trade intransigence and the strong sentiment for agricultural protectionism. Nokyo plays on Japanese feelings of vulnerability about their food supply, half of which comes from abroad despite import barriers.    Almost everyone over the age of 50 -- 40% of the population -- remembers the severe food shortages that accompanied World War II and its aftermath when many ate grasshoppers and boiled grass to survive. Nokyo has framed the debate in Japan so that Washington's demands that Japan lower barriers to U.S. farm products are viewed as attempts to reduce farming, which would put Japan once again at the mercy of the outside world.    As a result, say scholars, Japan has grown more protectionist, not less, on agriculture in the past 15 years. &quot;Food security is a very good excuse,&quot; says Yujiro Hayami, a professor of economics at Aoyama-Gakuin University in Tokyo. &quot;It is a very good way to scare the public . . . and to reduce resistance, and it is essentially a shield for Nokyo.&quot;    Nokyo has a lot to protect. In addition to controlling the marketing of much of Japan's farm production, the agrarian union is also one of the world's largest banks, one of Japan's biggest insurance companies and a major manufacturing concern with thousands of retail outlets that even sell cars and major appliances. Nokyo's operating profits exceeded $15 billion on revenue of $57.61 billion last year, ranking it among the largest companies in the world, bigger than IBM or Mobil Oil. (By contrast, Cargill, one of the biggest privately held companies in the U.S., has revenue of $32 billion.)    Nokyo derives its power from a politically active membership of eight million, which includes about six million farmers who have grown prosperous on the $60 billion in annual government subsidies that Nokyo has won for farmers and which it helps distribute. It employs half a million people, or one person for every 12 Japanese farmers.    Moreover, it maintains its influence with contributions of about $110 million a year to members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, according to U.S. government analysts. &quot;There is no organization in a democracy that has the clout Nokyo has,&quot; says a U.S. government official in Tokyo.    Even though barriers to imported agricultural goods keep Japanese food prices among the highest in the world -- rice is eight times more expensive here than in the U.S. -- there is nary a peep from consumers. In fact, a coalition of 18 consumer groups, representing 20 million people, came out against the &quot;unprincipled liberalization of food imports&quot; and declared that rice imports &quot;should never be liberalized.&quot;    Nokyo's close ties to consumer groups helps foster that attitude. Says Naokazu Takeuchi, president of the Consumers Union of Japan: &quot;We are trying to strengthen our interests with Nokyo. There shouldn't be a conflict of interest between food producers and consumers. They should have an intimate relationship.&quot; Mr. Takeuchi describes his group as the only &quot;Ralph Nader-style&quot; consumer group in Japan.    At 7:30 every Thursday morning Nokyo delivers a box of milk, meat, vegetables and fruit to the Consumers Union headquarters in the outskirts of Tokyo. But Mr. Takeuchi says he takes no direct financial contributions from Nokyo. They pay him an honorarium, plus expenses, to speak at conventions of Nokyo youth and women. Nokyo has also bought as many as 10,000 Consumer Union publications in one year, one-sixth of the group's sales.    Other consumer groups make money by selling beef brought in under Japan's complicated quota system. The system limits supply and pushes the price of beef that is imported for less than $3 a pound to beyond $15 a pound. Last year, sellers of imported beef in Japan made about $928 million, says the U.S. Meat Export Federation.    Mr. Takeuchi's views and those of other consumer leaders closely reflect Nokyo's. &quot;We think it is wrong to look at our food as if it were a color TV or a VCR,&quot; he says. &quot;We aren't trying to bully America, but if there is too much wheat in America send it to Africa or the Third World. We don't want it. Don't push it on us.&quot;    To many Japanese, including those in the government Agriculture Ministry, the high prices are a sort of insurance policy for food security. Japan's farmers produce barely enough to feed 50% of its people, so if imports were cut off, the Japanese would suffer as they did in the war. &quot;It isn't rational to expect that the U.S. will help Japan {in the event of a war-caused food shortage},&quot; says one ministry official. Yet, the government, which stockpiles oil and even has a 10-month supply of raw silk, stores very little food.    All that contributes to the feeling of vulnerability that keeps Japanese sticking to the status quo. &quot;We are in a recession right now,&quot; says Hatoko Shimizu, secretary general of the Japan Housewives' Association. &quot;If we switch to cheaper products from abroad, where are there going to be jobs for our children?&quot;    No one is suggesting a quick change in Japanese attitudes. Prof. Hayami expects protectionist sentiment to increase in the next few years as Japanese agriculture continues to decline. Surveys show that two-thirds of the Japanese believe as much food as possible should be grown in Japan even if it is more expensive than imported food. The percentage is only slightly lower for young Japanese, indicating how pervasive the attitude is.    A confidential U.S. government report says the feelings of vulnerability and protectionism fostered by Nokyo and the government are entrenched. &quot;A prompt change in perception and viewpoint in the general public can only be precipitated by a major crisis, e.g., an all-out trade war,&quot; it says. </TEXT></DOC>
