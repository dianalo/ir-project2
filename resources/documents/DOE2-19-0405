The role of H{sub 2}O vapor during the high-temperatureanneal is understood through a thermodynamic analysis of the fluorineremoval reaction. The role of a HF getter (e.g., SiO{sub 2}) is understoodthrough the same type of analysis. We have demonstrated that a zero resistancetransition temperature at 77 K can be obtained for an annealing temperatureas low as 690 {sup 0}C for films deposited on SrTiO{sub 3} substratesby increasing the P/sub Handgt;2/O$ and decreasing P/sub HF/ during the high-temperaturesoak cycle.</TEXT></DOC>
