People of Asian descent, including the large Chinese community,have increasingly been threatened, insulted in public, and deniedentry to restaurants since Fujimori's surprisingly strong finish inthe April 8 vote.   For many, it's a nightmare relived.   Fifty years ago, just before the outbreak of World War II in thePacific, Juan Iida watched mobs loot the homes and businesses ofJapanese Peruvians.   ``It was the worst experience of my life,'' said Iida, the77-year-old founder of the Japanese-language daily newspaper PeruShimpo. ``I don't even want to think about it happening again.''   Anti-Japanese fever peaked with a recent statement by Sen.Enrique Chirinos Soto, a spokesman for rival candidate Mario VargasLlosa. He said Peru is not ``ready to have as president afirst-generation Peruvian.''   Vargas Llosa dismissed the spokesman and decried the racialincidents. People in other circles, including outgoing PresidentAlan Garcia and Lima's Roman Catholic archbishop, have also spokenout against the hatred.   Fujimori, an agronomist born of Japanese parents, won nearly 30percent of the vote in the April 8 balloting to 32 percent forVargas Llosa, forcing a runoff. Backed by left-of-center voters,the political independent is expected to prevail over theconservative novelist in voting expected in early June.   ``Fujimori is as Peruvian as I am and as you are,'' Vargas Llosashouted at supporters who chanted anti-Japanese slogans outside hishome the night after the election. Even so, some critics haveaccused members of his center-right Democratic Front coalition ofdeliberately fanning the fires of racism to cut into Fujimori'ssupport.   ``It was a primitive response by frustrated people,'' saidAmelia Morimoto Hayashi, of the Japanese Peruvian Cultural Center.   However, in the long run, it may be Vargas Llosa who suffers ifrace becomes an important issue in the campaign, according to someanalysts.   Eighty-five percent of Peru's population is Indian and mestizo.Another 5 percent is black.   In addition, Vargas Llosa is viewed by many as part of the whitecaste that has traditionally ruled this Andean country from coastalLima. An urbane man, he lived and wrote for 16 years in Europebefore returning to Peru in 1974. Critics accuse him of being outof touch with Peruvian reality.   ``The final stretch of the campaign revealed the racist andclass character of Vargas Llosa's entourage,'' said FernandoRospigliosi, a columnist for the independent news magazine Caretas.   Indeed, Rospigliosi said Fujimori's success so far has stemmedin great measure from deeply rooted anti-white prejudices: ``Thehigh vote obtained by Fujimori can be explained in part, in myopinion, by the racial factor.''   Fujimori's own reaction has varied with the moment.   Sometimes he has joked. ``Some people fear that during mygovernment they will have to eat with chopsticks,'' he said soonafter the elections.   Later, he blamed the racial outbursts on ``certain discontentedgroups that are making use of whatever weapons available to createproblems.''   Fujimori's own campaign may actually have helped bring theracism to the surface.   Throughout the race, he played on Peruvians' stereotype oforientals as ``hard-working and honest.'' He has repeatedlyreferred to himself as ``el chinito,'' the little Chinaman.   Many voters thus came to view him as a foreigner, and thisworked largely in his favor. Public opinion polls show that votersregard foreigners as less corrupt and more efficient than Peruvians.   Racism has long played a part in Peru's history. Peru'stelevision stars and news announcers are generally white, as arepeople in most advertisements. The winner of the Miss Peru pageantinvariably is white.   The Maoist guerrilla known as the Shining Path is to some extentan outgrowth of anti-white sentiment among the Quechua-speakingIndians of Peru's highlands.   Most Japanese Peruvians are the children of pre-World War IIimmigrants who came to work on coastal plantations. Most latermoved to cities and many started their own businesses.   On May 13, 1940, dozens of their stores and homes were looted bymobs driven by anti-Japanese war propaganda. Most businesses thatsurvived the looting were seized later by the government.   More than 1,400 Japanese Peruvians were deported to camps in theUnited States, where other Japanese Americans were detained.   After the war most Japanese Peruvians had to start over withnothing. Many spent the next four decades ``just trying tointegrate, to become Peruvian, so it wouldn't happen again,'' Ms.Morimoto says.   Most Japanese Peruvians have been successful. Many own largebusinesses and factories. Others are doctors, lawyers, andengineers.   But the memories remain.   ``What I fear most is that Mr. Fujimori will not make a goodgovernment, which is a very difficult task in Peru today,'' said61-year-old Gerardo Maruy, retiring president of the JapanesePeruvian Association.   ``The same people who thought him a miracle worker,'' saidMaruy, ``will be the first to turn against him, and against us.</TEXT></DOC>
