Under the proposed terms, Welsh, Carson, Anderson andamp; Stowe would pay either $15 a share cash or a combination of $10 cash and a unit of securities for each of Comdata's 19,040,000 common shares. Comdata shareholders would have the option of taking either form of payment, though Welsh Carson and its affiliated investors would own at least 60% of the fully diluted stock of the merged company.    The proposed transaction supplants a previously proposed recapitalization, under which the money-transfer services concern would have purchased as many as six million of its common shares for $14.50 each.    James G. Gregoric, executive vice president, said the new transaction was entered into in the interest of &quot;maximizing shareholder value.&quot; He said the merged entity would probably continue to be a publicly traded company. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Comdata closed at $14.375, down 50 cents.    The proposed transaction is subject to a definitive agreement and approval by Comdata holders. It is subject also to Welsh Carson obtaining as much as about $200 million in debt financing, which that firm believes can be done through major commercial banks and investment-banking firms.    Welsh Carson manages private investment partnerships, concentrating on leveraged buyouts of companies in the data-processing industry.    Separately, a group led by Rosewood Financial Inc., a Dallas-based investment firm, disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it bought a 6.2% stake in Comdata and may seek representation on the company's board.    The group said it opposed the previously proposed recapitalization plan and &quot;may seek to influence the policies and management of Comdata.&quot; It also disclosed that it had asked federal antitrust regulators for clearance to increase its stake to more than 15%, should it decide to do so.    The company doesn't regard the filing as a threat to the newly proposed merger, according to Mr. Gregoric. </TEXT></DOC>
