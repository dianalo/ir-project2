<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-17-1157 </DOCNO><TEXT>A combinatorial optimization methodology is developed, which enables theefficient use of hypercube multiprocessors onboard mobile intelligentrobots dedicated to time-critical missions. The methodology is implementedin terms of large-scale concurrent algorithms based either on fast simulatedannealing, or on nonlinear asynchronous neural networks. In particular,analytic expressions are given for the effect of single-neuron perturbationson the systems' configuration energy. Compact neuromorphic data structuresare used to model effects such as precedence constraints, processor idlingtimes, and task-schedule overlaps. Results for a typical robot-dynamicsbenchmark are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
