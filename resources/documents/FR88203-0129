Unless otherwisedetermined by the Secretary , or otherwise agreed by the sponsor and theusing agency, substantial use of an airport by government aircraft willbe considered to exist when operations of such aircraft are in excess ofthose which, in the opinion of the Secretary, would unduly interfere withuse of the landing areas by other authorized aircraft, or during any calendarmonth that_a.
