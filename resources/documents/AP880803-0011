The official China News Service, in a report monitored in HongKong, also said 316 people were missing after the downpour.   On Tuesday, the official Xinhua News Agency said 225 people werekilled and 449 were missing in the deluge and sudden flooding,which struck Friday and Saturday.   Xinhua said 100,000 people were affected by the flooding, whichdestroyed more than 16,000 homes, broke 100 reservoirs and 305bridges and caused damage estimated at $167 million.   Qiu Weikang, an official from the flood-hit city of Ningbo, saidtoday that the search continued for the missing.   But a provincial foreign affairs official who identified himselfonly as Huang said chances of finding any more survivors were slimbecause the floods came so fast that farmers had no time to escape.   He called the flooding the worst ever to hit the denselypopulated province.   Qiu said as much as 18 inches of rain fell in a five- orsix-hour period in parts of the five hard-hit counties aroundNingbo, a prosperous commercial city on the East China Sea.   He said the rainfall was the heaviest in 100 years.   Qiu said the floodwaters have receded, electricity and watersupplies have been restored and roads have been reopened.   The city has mobilized efforts to donate clothing to disastervictims. Private entrepreneurs also donated money, Qiu said.   The storm triggered Zhejiang's second flood disaster of theyear. Forty-five died after torrential rains in late June.   At least 750 people have been reported killed in floods ravagingcoastal, southern and northern China this year, while wide areas ofcentral China are suffering from one of the worst droughts inmemory.</TEXT></DOC>
