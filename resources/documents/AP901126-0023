The charges against Chen Zeming, publisher of the now-bannedEconomic Studies Weekly, and Wang Juntao, its editor, are the mostserious to be brought so far against intellectuals involved in thepro-democracy movement.   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said relativesof the two men received formal notices late last week that Chen andWang had been charged with ``plotting to overthrow the governmentand counterrevolutionary incitement.''   The Beijing city Foreign Affairs Office said it had not heardabout the charges.   The government's move, more than a year after the two men werearrested, indicated its desire to wrap up remaining cases from theprotest movement and put the controversial events behind it.   Other sources have said the government is preparing to holdtrials for alleged ringleaders of the protests, which began withstudent marches in Beijing in April 1989 and spread nationwide. Themovement was crushed when the army opened fire on protesters inBeijing two months later, killing hundreds on unarmed civilians.   Hundreds of participants in the protests already have been sentto labor camps, a punishment that requires no trial. Dozens ofothers have been tried secretly, and at least 18 are known to havebeen executed.   However, none of the alleged ringleaders has yet been put ontrial. One reason is the Communist Party's fear that trials wouldrequire releasing information about the involvement of high-levelparty officials in the movement. The party has closed itsinvestigation of ousted party chief Zhao Ziyang without announcingany conclusions or punishment for that very reason.   Zhao was dismissed as party general secretary last year forallegedly supporting the democracy movement.   Chen and Wang acted as advisers to the Beijing student protests,helping plan the strategy of early student marches and formulatedemands.   Both got their first experience in confronting the government in1976, when they joined a protest in Tiananmen Square against theradical leftist officials who led the destructive CulturalRevolution.   They were arrested then, but were released when the CulturalRevolution leadership was ousted and the protest was officiallyreappraised as patriotic.   Wang became a leader in the Communist Youth League, butcontinued challenging the official line. He helped found anunofficial journal called Beijing Spring in 1978 during a briefperiod of open political debate called the Democracy Wall Movement.Many other participants in that movement were jailed.   He and Wang were arrested in October 1989, in Canton, where theyapparently were trying to flee the country.   Family members have not been allowed to visit Wang and Chen inprison, although they have been allowed to send books and clothing.Wang's wife, Hou Xiaotian, also was jailed for several months afterthe protests. She was recently released from a hospital after beingtreated for ailments she said were related to her prison stay.   The government recently set up a special group of lawyers todefend protesters brought to trial. Sources said the protesterswould not be allowed to hire their own lawyers or organize theirown defense.   Authorities say 355 people remain in jail under investigation inBeijing in connection with the democracy movement, and two inShanghai. No figures have been released for the rest of thecountry.</TEXT></DOC>
