Mr. President, from time to time I have been reporting to mycolleagues a bicentennial minute, since this is the bicentennial year,of things that happened in the past in the Senate that I think may be ofinterest to my colleagues.[S16MY8-19]{S5878}may 16, 18<ITAG tagnum="89">may 16, 1<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>868<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>: dramatic senate first vote to remove a president</ITAG>Mr. President, 120 years ago today, on May 16, 1<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>8<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>68, for the first time in history, the Senate votedon an article of impeachment lodged against a President of the United States.By a tally of 35 to 19, the Senate fell 1 vote short of the two-thirdsmargin necessary to remove President Andrew Johnson from Office.During the Constitution Convention of 1787, the delegates gave close attentionto the Senate's role in impeachment trials. Several argued that the Presidentshould not be impeachable, for this would make him too dependent on thelegislature. In opposition, Benjamin Franklin asserted that there mustbe some ultimate limitation on Presidential power and that impeachmentwas a method of removal greatly to be preferred to the alternative_assassination.The Convention struggled over the definition of an impeachable offense.Early draft language identified these offenses as ``neglect of duty, bribery,maladministration, or corruption.'' Finally, the delegates settled on ``highcrimes and misdemeanors'' as encompassing the above terms.Early in their deliberations, the framers wrestled with the apparent conflictof giving the Senate the power to elect the President, as was then contemplated,and also the power to remove him. At first they tried to solve this byhaving the Supreme Court and the Senate jointly conduct impeachment trials.Late in the Convention, after the framers devised a special electoral collegeto select Presidents, the way was cleared for the Senate alone to try impeachmentsof all Federal officers, including Presidents. In trials involving a President,the Chief Justice of the United States would preside, keeping the VicePresident, who would normally preside from the impropriety of conductinga trial that might result in his own ele<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>va<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tion to the Presidency.Although the Senate has conducted only one impeachment trial against aPresident, its power of removal remains a vital safeguard of our liberties.[S16MY8-20]{S5878}F<ITAG tagnum="66"><CODE-213>5</CODE-213>F<CODE-213>0</CODE-213></ITAG>[S16MY8-21]{S5878}THE TRADE <ITAG tagnum="81">THE TRADE BILL</ITAG>[S16MY8-22]{S5878}DOLEMr. DOLE. Mr. President, I know that the trade bill has been sent to thePresident. I think it arrived on Frida<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the 13th.I assume the President, in keeping with public statements he has made andstatements he has made to many of us, will veto that bill.I know that one provision the President is strongly opposed to is the so-calledplant closing. But there are other provisions in the bill that I wouldhope that the President w<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>uld detail in his veto message because, in my view,there are numerous provisions that should be modified or dropped from thetrade bill before the President sends up his veto message that should beaddressed in that veto message.If that is done, it is my hope that before the year is out the House andthe Senate can get together on another trade bill, pass it promptly inthe House, hopefully quite quickly in the Senate, and send it back to thePresident for his signature, because overall the trade bi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ll<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> is not bad.There has been a lot of work. Senators <T4>Bentsen </T4>and <T4>Packwood, </T4>in particular, in the Senate have spent weeks and weeksand weeks and months and months trying to devise a trade bill.There are some provisions that I believe the Senate will h<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>pefully delineate in his veto message that shouldbe altered, modified, or deleted.If that is done, I would hope that we will have a trade bill.Plant closing has been the one issue discussed publicly. In my view, thereare other matters just as important. It is not a matter of notice to theemployees. It is a matter of whether the Government should become involvedin the private sector and start telling a business what they can and cannotdo.But in any event, the bill is now at the White House. I assume at sometime in the next couple of weeks the President will make his decision andsend us a message.Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.[S16MY8-23]{S5878}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S16MY8-24]{S5878}AMERICAN P<ITAG tagnum="81">AMERICAN PUBLIC OPINION SAYS ECONOMY NOT MILITARY NO. 1 PRIORITY</ITAG>[S16MY8-25]{S5878}PROXMIREMr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, the Council for a Livable World has recentlypublished a number of public opinion poll results that show a strong consensustoward economic over military priorities. The polls were conducted duringtwo periods. The first polling period was between October 15 and 20 oflast year. The second polls occurred between February 17 and 24 of thisyear. Based on these polls, how do our constituents evaluate the strengthof our country? A nationwide sample of 1,505 persons were asked<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>:<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> ``Do you agree or disagree? In today's world a country'seconomic power is more important than military power in determining itsinternational influence.'' 67 percent agreed, 20 percent disagreed, 13percent responded ``don't know.''Responses to a second question indicated a similar view. Asked: ``Whenpeople talk about the strength of the United States they sometimes meandifferent things. Which of the following come closest to the way you thinkabout the strength of the United States?'' Of the 93 percent of the respondentswho had an opinion only 14 percent said ``military strength.'' Another3 percent said, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>`<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>`Getting our way with other countries.'' The other76 percent responded as follows: Unity of the American people, 26 percent;economic strength, 21 percent; setting a moral example to the world, 16percent; a strong education system, 13 percent.Asked<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>:<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> ``Which do you think is more important_investingin a strong economy or a strong military, or don't you have an opinion?''59 percent responded ``economy,'' 14 percent ``military,'' 23 percent replied``both,'' 4 percent replied ``don't know.''A reason for this emphasis on economic instead of military strength wasdisclosed by respondees to a fourth question. Asked<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>:<ITAG tagnum="80">``Which of the following do you think is the greatest threat to thefuture of the United States?'' Respondents declared: ``Economic troubleswithin the United States, 48 percent; terrorism from third world countriesand extremist groups, 31 percent; the military strength of the Soviet Union,17 percent, don't know, 4 percent.''</ITAG>Taken together, these responses show an American public that understandsthat the security of our country fundamentally rests on its economic strength.Behind that widespread American conviction is the knowledge that economiccapability is quintessential for military strength. There is also the factthat as President Eisenhower told us, excessive military spending drainsthe economy. Such spending diverts our economic resources from improvingeducation and health and from building a more efficient and productiveindustry. The resources instead flow into amassing a vast military arsenalthat will cost billions to maintain. Many American are also struck withthe irony that the superpowers are building their huge military establishmentsduring a period in which infinitely destructive nuclear power makes a superpowerwar a certain loser for both sides and therefore an event that will almostcertainly never take place. When the President of the United States andthe Secretary General of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union agreethat a nuclear war can never be won and must never be fought, and whenvirtually every informed scientific expert fully agrees, the arms racebetween the two superpowers is the ultimate waste.The Council for a Livable World cites this question, asked of a scientificallyselected sample of 1,505 Americans nationwide, ``Over the last 6 yearsthe United States has increased its military spending. Has this militarybuildup made you feel more secure, about the same, or less secure thanyou felt 6 years ago_or haven't you thought much about this?'' The response:42 percent said that the big military buildup had made no difference. Another20 percent replied that they felt less secure. Only 31 percent respondedthat the buildup had made them feel more secure. Seven percent had no opinion.Asked, ``How much waste, fraud and inefficiency do you think there is indefense spending_a lot, some, not very much or none at all?'' sixty-eightpercent responded ``A lot,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>'' 28 percent said, ``Some''; only 2 percent said,``Not very much''; 2 percent said, ``Not sure.''Asked whether the United States should try harder to reduce tensions withthe Russians or get tougher in this dealing with the Russians, 64 percentsaid reduce tensions; 26 percent said get tougher; 7 percent said followpresent policy; 2 percent said, ``Don't <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>k<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>now.''Asked what are the most important problems the next President should workon, only 14 percent mentioned ``Strengthening our national defense.'' Andin response to a question on what should be the most important goals ofAmerican foreign policy, only 22 percent said ``containing Soviet expansion.''This contrasts with 62 percent who specified ``strengthening our econ<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>my to be more competitive with other countries.''Mr. President, these responses show strong support for negotiating agreementswith the Soviet Union to terminate the arms race on all fronts_nuclearand conventional, and concentrating our energies on building an economicallystronger, better educated, healthier country.[S16MY8-26]{S5879}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S16MY8-27]{S5879}NATIONAL D<ITAG tagnum="81">NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT</ITAG>The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the bill presented by the Armed Services Committeecontains a new provision, which is section 802. It concerns the use offixed price contracts in research and development programs. This is anissue we had faced in the Department of Defense <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ap<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>propriations bill for this current year. It was originallyproposed by the House Appropriations Committee.The present provision in this bill before the Senate, introduced by mygood friend, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Senator <T4>Bingaman, </T4>places a limit on the use of firm fixed-price contractsin full-<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>sc<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ale engineering development programs. My concernis not so much with the issue of the use of this contracting mechanism.I am worried by the precedent of the Congress restricting specific contractingpractices of the Department of Defense.I agree with the Senator from New Mexico that most research and developmentprograms are too immature and not sufficiently defined to permit a rigidcontracting structure. I agree that we must be wary in attempts to savemoney in the Randamp;D phase by forcing contract terms. We probably couldsave a dollar in Randamp;D costs, however, only to spend $5 in procurementchange orders if we are not careful.Last year we faced an even more stringent proposal from the House AppropriationsCommittee. I opposed that initiative, also. Ultimately, in <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>conference, we settled on report language that iscontained in the report that ac<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>companied the continued resolution.I believe the proposal in the bill that is before the Senate now takesa more reasoned approach to the issue. My amendment limits the force ofthat provision to 2 years, through September 30, 1990. This limitationwill provide both the Department of Defense and Congress an opportunityto study the issue and evaluate the use of fixed-price contracts in Randamp;Dprograms.We should be careful not to tie the hands of the program managers and contractofficials at the Pentagon with too many legislative restrictions as wecontinue to tighten defense budgets and demand even more bang for the buck.We must not forestall contracting and management options that can preventgold plating of some of the weap<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>on<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> systems.I do express my appreciation, Mr. President, to the Senator from New Mexicofor his consideration of my conce<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>rns,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and the managers on both side of the aisle who aremanaging this bill on the floor for their assistance and cooperation andthat of their staffs in reaching an accommodation on this amendment. Asa member of the Defen<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>se Ap<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>propriations Subcommittee, I look forward to workingwith them in monitoring this issue now.This compromise, I <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>think, wi<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ll avoid more restrictive legislation in the appropriationsprocess this year. This is a provision that I think both the authorizingcommittee and the Appropriations Committee can live with for at least a2-year period to study the impact of such a restriction.I ask my good friend from Georgia and my friend from Virginia if this amendmentis acceptable.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>[S16MY8-40]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5879}<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>WARNERMr. WARNER. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. President, we have had the opportunity to examinethe amendment of the Senator from Alaska. It is acceptable to this side. [S16MY8-41]{S5879}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator's major changehere is to convert a permanent provision on a fixed-price contracting provisioninto a 2-year provision to determine whether it is working and give usa chance to assess it without making it permanent. Is that correct?  [S16MY8-42]{S5880}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct. That is the major change. It makesa fixed time period during which we can analyze the impact of this.  [S16MY8-43]{S5880}NUNNMr. NUNN. I think this is a good amendment. This is a complicated area.While we want fixed-price contracting anytime we can get it where it makessense, there were some instances here in the last several years that theDepartment of Defense has insisted on fixed-price contracting when theelements of risk and when the research was at a very primitive stage andmade it impossible to have a sensible fixed-price contract.  We are trying to strike a proper balance under the rules of fixed-pricecontracting in that area, the Randamp;D area, as opposed to the procurementarea. I believe the 2-year limitation will give us a chance to furtherassess that. So I would urge our colleagues to support the amendment. [S16MY8-44]{S5880}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from Virginia and Georgiafor their comments. I might say that it is my goal to avoid this issuein the appropriations conference which, by its very nature, is going totake place much later in the session. If the authorizing committee fromthe Senate can obtain approval of the authorizing committee from the Houseon this measure, I think it will eliminate a substantial <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>controversy <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>between the House and the Senate in the appropriationsconference.

Mr. President, this amendment applies <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>to <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>section 807 of the bill which pertains to foreignselling costs.Mr. President, if enacted, section 807 of this bill would have the effectof reversing a government policy which has been in effect for nearly 10years which prohibits the allowability of contractor costs associated withforeign marketing endeavors. Over the past year, the administration hassent mixed signals as to its position on this matter. Clearly, the defenseindustry feels that such a policy reversal would be beneficial.Given the uncertainty as to the Government's position on this issue aswell as misgivings over the fiscal prudence if such costs were allowable,the annual appropriations bill has incorporated a prohibition against regulationchanges to make such costs allowable. Section 8062 of the fiscal year 1988Appropriations Act contains this <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>prohibition.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Last month, the deputy inspector general, Derek Vander Schaaf, testifiedbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee on this issue. He stated:[S16MY8-54]{S5880}<ITAG tagnum="21">It is our position that there should be a direct and beneficial relationshipto the Department prior to our assuming costs from foreign marketing activities.</ITAG>I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Vander Schaaf's statement be printed inthe <T4>Record</T4> immediately following my prepared remarks.The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.(See exhibit 1.)[S16MY8-55]{S5880}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. The <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>IG'<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>position argues against the allowability of foreignmarketing expenses <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>absent <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>a clear indication of financial benefit to the U.S.Government. The Appropriations Committee sponsored prohibitions on allowabilityof such costs has been based on the same concerns expressed by the DefenseInspector General's Office.While section 807 would permit foreign selling costs as an allowable expense,this section does represent the first serious attempt to define the parametersunder which allowability of such costs may accrue some benefits to theUnited States.The provision recommended by the Armed <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Se<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rvices Committ<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ee<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> requires the negotiation of advance agreements betweencontractors and the Secretary of Defense to determine the nature and scopeof foreign marketing costs to be allowable. This is a step in the rightdirection, but the inspector general also points out that the criteriafor determining such advance agreements under the terms of the committee-sponsoredprovision is somewhat vague.In an effort to allev<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ia<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>te this concern and clarify the requirements, I proposean amendment to section 807. This com<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>es<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> from our prior work on the Appropriations <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Su<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>bcommittee on the same subject. The amendment wouldrequire that the Secretary determine that cost advantages will accrue fromallowing such foreign selling costs and that these savings be reflectedin the annual budget requests submitted to Congress.Having sponsored the provision to prohibit these costs in the annual appropriationsbills, I am still not entirely convinced that permitting foreign marketingexpenses within allowable contract overhead is beneficial to the UnitedS<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ta<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tes and I continue to share the reservations expressedby the Defense Inspector General's Office. However, there is also a volumeof evidence which motivated Deputy Secretary of Defense Will Taft to findbenefit in this cost accounting approach. At a minimum, my amendment tosection 807 establishes a ``means test'' on the prudence of incurring suchexpenses if they are in fact considered to be allowable.Thus, as amended, section 807 goes a long way toward addressing the concernswhich led to the enactment of prohibitions in the appropriations bills.Assuming section 807 is part of the enacted bill as amended by this amendmentthat I submitted, the need to consider this matter in future appropriationsbills will be substantially alleviated, I think, if not eliminated.[S16MY8-56]{S5880}Exhibit 1<ITAG tagnum="74">Exhibit </ITAG>1[S16MY8-57]{S5880}Statement <ITAG tagnum="74">Statement by Derek J.

Our opposition to the proposed legislation on foreignselling costs is based on several factors. These include:</ITAG>[S16MY8-60]{S5881}1.<ITAG tagnum="21">1. Lack of a direct and beneficial relationship to the Defense Departmentfrom the financing of such costs;</ITAG>[S16MY8-61]{S5881}2.<ITAG tagnum="21">2. Funds allocated to foreign selling costs could be better us<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ed<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> in other ways to more improve the competitiveness(productivity and reliability) and cost-effectiveness of contractors; and</ITAG>[S16MY8-62]{S5881}3.<ITAG tagnum="21">3. A large portion of defense equipment and service purchases madeby foreign governments a<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>re<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> paid for through United States foreign assistanceappropriations that are required to be spent in the United States.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In 1985, the Congressional Budget Office looked into the potentialcosts and benefits that could be anticipated from allocating foreign sellingcosts to defense contracts. In a July 1985 letter on this subject to SenatorStevens, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office stated:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``It is unlikely, however, that there would be any increase in foreignsales to offset additional budget costs . . . foreign sales are such anintegral part of the business that marketing is unconstrained by cost <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>allocability. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Also, DoD and industry representatives agree thatother political and economic constraints probably limit any increase insales. If this is so, repealing the prohibition could cost the FederalGovernment as much as $80 million to $300 million or more per year.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is our position that there should be a direct and beneficial relationshipto the Department prior to our assuming costs from foreign marketing activities.Obviously, there may be some indirect benefit to the Department if, asa result of foreign marketing activities, the overall Defense businessbase is enlarged. Our initial reaction is one of visualizing increasedcosts <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the DoD with only a nebulous benefit from potentiallyincreased sales. Thus, from an accounting point of view, there is a seriousquestion on the allocability of such spending.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As I mentioned earlier, a major portion of foreign sales are financedby U.S. foreign assistance appropriations. The foreign governments arerequired under these appropriations to purchase equipment and materialfrom U.S. contractors. Accordingly, I fail to see commensurate benefitsto the Defense Department or the U.S. Government by paying contractorsfor selling expenses on items that have to be purchased from them by law.I would compare this to Department of Defense paying selling expenses toa contractor that is the current sole source supplier of a weapons system.In both cases whether we paid such selling costs or not, the Defense Departmentand the foreign government would still purchase the items from the contractor.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Further, rather than paying for the entertaining of foreign officials,I believe that alternative uses of such funds would provide a greater benefitto the Defense Department. These funds should be used to support existingcontractor productivity enhancement and improvement programs such as theIndustrial Modernization Incentives Program. Such an action would directlycontribute to improve competitiveness of U.S. producers and lower coststo the Defense Department.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Currently corporate decisions to incur foreign marketing expensesare based on good business judgment. In effect the proposed legislationwould move the basis of such decisions from good business sense to a questionof ``Will the government underwrite this expense?'' In other words, ifthe federal government is willing to foot the bill for overseas sellingexpenses, nearly everyone would opt to incur the reimburseable cost.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finally, I have concerns about the feasibility and potential problemsassociated with<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>the <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>establishment and administration of annual dollarceilings on foreign selling costs. What criteria would be used to establishsuch ceilings in view of the problems associated with determining the actualor potential benefits of such costs? To what extent will we approve theexpenditure of DoD funds to finance the competition of two or more U.S.companies vying to sell the ``same'' item. Moreover, defense contractingofficers would be subjected to extreme external pressures in setting suchceilings which would increase the opportunities for abuses and fraudulentactivities.</ITAG>I believe this amendment now has been agreed to on both sides and againI thank the managers of the bill and their staffs for their cooperationand patience in attempting to work this out. I think it will work it out,so this will be one other area that we will bury the hatchet between theauthorizing committee and Appropriations Committee.  Again, I inquire of my good friends if this is the case?  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Se<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nator from Virginia.  [S16MY8-63]{S5881}WARNERMr. WARNER. The Senator from Alaska correctly rep<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>re<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>sents the sentiments of this manager and I urge theadoption of the amendment.  [S16MY8-64]{S5881}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, this is another area where we have had a differencein policy with the Appropriations Committee. I do not think the differenceis a major difference because both of us want to prevent abuses and bothof us want to allow the appropriate costs.  The Senator from Alaska has made some good points relating to the cost-overheadfactor in the foreign sales cost factor and how it ought to relate to overhead.I believe this amendment is an appropriate balance between the variousconsiderations here; between the consideration on the one hand to makesure that the Government costs do go down and on the other hand to makesure that the appropriate costs are passed on in appropriate manner, afterhaving been approved in concept by the Department of Defense.  So, this is a good amendment. We urge its adoption.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.  [S16MY8-65]{S5881}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I just add that one member of the industrycame to me and commented upon the appropriations provision, that they hadoriginally opposed, saying that as a result of the provision they haveanalyzed some of their overseas marketing costs and found that they shouldnot be incurring them anyway.  So it has brought about, I think, an understanding of concerns of the Congressand, in view of the statement of the Department's <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>In<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>spector <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Ge<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>neral, I think this is a proper solution and it shouldeliminate the difficulties between the two committees. I ask adoption ofthe amendment.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there any further debate on this amendment?If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.  The amendment (No. 2080) was agreed to.  [S16MY8-66]{S5881}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which theamendment was agreed to.  [S16MY8-67]{S5881}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, I m<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ove<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> to lay that motion on the table.  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.  [S16MY8-68]{S5881}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. There is another matter I will not get into. I understandthere is a negotiation between the Senator from Louisiana representingthe chairman of our Appropriations Committee, Senator <T4>Stennis, </T4>and the manager of the bill, concerning section 903. I can only state that I am not going to ask for a rollcall vote on that.This is a decision that has been made in the negotiations between the membersof the staff.  Senator <T4>Hatfield, </T4>the ranking member on our side, wi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ll<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> be back in the Senate, I am informed, in just afew minutes.  I do want to say on the record, however, that although I will not opposethe conclusion that, I believe, has been reached by the staffs of the fullcommittees, it does seem to me that the inclusion of the P-3 aircraft thatwe authorized to be procured for <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>the <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Navy Reserve being deauthoriz<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ed<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and the specific requirement that that mon<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ey<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> not be obligated and expended, is not a good conclusion. The other three ite<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ms,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> I think, in the restriction on appropriated fundsfrom the appropriations account are, under the circumstances, a matterof negotiation and I can see some differences of opinion with<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="80">regard to those three items. They were not substantial. But in allprobability they can be covered_I hope they will be covered_by authorizationssoon. I specifically mention the coastal defense augmentation account of$20 million.  </ITAG>I also believe that was something that should move and, in view of thefact that we had other items that we could not agree to, we allocated moneyto the coastal defense augmentation account in the appropriations processconnected with continuing resolution last year.  But the Navy Reserve needs these P-3's, in my judgment. It is not a questionof just allocating money that we found we had no appropriate emergencyuse for compared to the other. In this instance, the P-3 aircraft to beprocured for the Navy Reserve would put them in the position of havinga vital piece of equipment to assist in activities related to our coastaldefense. I really think that money should be made available.  As I said, I have talked to the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. <T4>Johnston, </T4>and those moneys are to be made available for otherprograms under this agreement. Those programs include operation and maintenanceto prevent the furlough and separation of civilian employees in other high-priorityreadiness programs. I appreciate the fact we have a great need for moneythere, but I am concerned that the moneys that would otherwise have beenavailable for the Navy Reserve for the procurement of P-3 aircraft willbe eliminated by this compromise that has been negotiated.  I hope that the authorizing committee will keep in mind, as it goes toconference, our real concern over those moneys. And if there is a disagreementin conference on the part of the House with regard to that section_I mightadd, the House did have a similar section in its authorizing bill and deletedit, it is my understanding.  I hope, since this will be going to conference, that perhaps the distinguishedmanagers of this bill could reconsider and make some money available forthe P-3C aircraft that both the Guard and the Reserve need.

Mr. President, this amendment presents a very narrow questionbut a very vital and important question. That question is, Shall the $20billion Aegis Destroyer Program be determined by free and open competitionor should that be restricted to two shipyards?The amount of money involved, Mr. President, could be an incredible amountfor the Government.The question presents itself, Mr. President, in the following way: Thepresent law requires that for the current fiscal year any ships bid underthis program be under free and open competition and not restricted to anyshipyard.The House Armed Service Committee overruled that requirement of presentlaw and determined that it should be restricted. The Senate Armed ServicesCommittee inserted a provision which purports to give free an<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>pen competition but which in effect does not.What the present provision of the Senate Armed Services Committee billprovides is that in effect competition cannot be limited ``unless the Secretarycertifies to Congress that the limitation of such competition to such contractors(i) will result in a lower total cost to the United States * * * or, (ii)is necessary to meet the cost, schedule, performance, or other requirementsof the Navy determined by the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Secretary.''<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Now, what our amendment does, Mr. President, is to take out that phrase``or other requirements of the Navy'' and, second, it says that certificationby the Secretary must be made after the bids are received.In effect, Mr. President, to say you are going to have a free and<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> open<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> competition and not know what the ground rules are,to have some language like the Secretary of the Navy can present a certificationthat says ``or other requirements of the Navy'' is to simply do away withfree and open competition. Here is the offending phrase, Mr. President;``or other requirements.''Now, in the 90 <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>mi<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nutes reserved for this amendment, I am going tobe asking repeatedly, what in the name of all that is good and holy doesthis mean. What does ``or other requirements'' <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>as<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> determined by the Secretary of the Navy mean?Why, it does not mean anything. It means whatever the Secretary of theNavy wants to say ``or other requirements'' means.It sort of reminds me, Mr. President, of when my daughter, Sally, was <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>sophomore in high school. And one morning she cameby, one Saturday morning, and she said, ``Dad, can I borrow your creditcard.'' S<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>he s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>aid, ``I want to go buy a sweater and stuff.''

And the sweater did notcost but $25, but the ``and stuff' cost about $150.[S16MY8-93]{S5883}WIRTHMr. WIRTH assumed the Chair.[S16MY8-94]{S5883}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I do not <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>kn<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ow why they did not use that phrase ``and stuff''because it is more colorful than the phrase ``or other requirements.''It is no more specific. It is no more meaningful. It is no more substantivethan the phrase ``or other requirements.''The problem here is if you are going to have free and open competitionyou have to know what the groundrules are.Our shipyard down there, Avondale, tells us that it costs $1.5 millionto submit a bid. You are not going to spend $1.5 million and take all thetime of your top executives submitting a bid if, after the bid is in andyou are the low bidder, they came up and then say, ``Aha, catch 22, wehave some other requirements.'' The other requirements are that you can<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>no<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t buy in-house and/or you must be in Maine or youmust be in a State that has a lobster population right offshore becauseour workers like to eat lobster. I do not know what it means, Mr. President.It does not mean anything.W<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>at is all this about, Mr. President? How did allof this come about that the Senate Armed Services Committee could havesuch a vague provision?What is <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>at <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>stake here, Mr. President, in addition to a $20 billionprogram is our shipyard, Avondale in New Orleans, tells us that they have5,800 employees <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>now, and <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>at<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> without the ability to bid and without getttingon this program they might go down to 2,000 employees. So it may be 4,000employees. Competition for those employees is very keen, indeed. The BathIron Works in Maine would like to keep all those employees. There is ashipyard in Mississippi; there is one in Seattle; there is another onein California. The fact of the matter is that the number of ships to bebuilt is decreasing, and the number of shipyards is still very great. So all shipyards want the opportunity to build these ships. And the questionis whether you decide that based on, What? Personality, whether you areon the Senate Armed Services Committee, or whether you are on a committeeor not, or other requirements, or whether you decide on the basis of freeand open competition.What happened in this competition in the past, Mr. President, is in 1985,the first competition took place for one ship. Bath won that. By the way,that first ship has not been compl<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>et<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ed yet. But they won the first competition. The <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>se<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>cond competition was for three ships. That was infiscal year 1987. The RFP, that is the request for proposals, specificallystated it was for fiscal year 1987. It was for three ships or for two shipsand one option. And it provided that the Navy would give at least one ofthose ships to Bath. That is the shipyard in Maine. If they were not thelow bidder, then they would negotiate. What happened? The Ingalls shipyard,the first shipyard, came in at the low bid of $160 million. So they gotthe first ship. Avondale came in second at $148 million. But they did notget the second ship, according to the provisions of that RFP. Bath<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> which had a $263 million or about $89 million overAvondale, entered into negotiations with the Navy. And they negotiatedthem down to $190 million, still above Avondale. But they negotiated themdown to $190 million. So that at present Bath has two ships, one which they won on the firstbid, the one which they won on the second bid by negotiating down, andthe third ship is at Ingalls in Mississippi. Mr. President, after this bidding was over in August 1987, the Navy sendsa letter to Avondale, and says, well, notwithstanding the fact_well, theydid not say notwithstanding the fact. This is editorial comment on my part.They said in effect notwithstanding the fact that these RFP's were limitedto the fiscal year involved, fiscal year 1987, they said from now on weare going to limit this binding program to Bath and to Ingalls. In the first place, Mr. President, that is illegal under the Competitionin Contracting Act. The Competition in Contracting Act says that the fulland open competition shall be used by the Department of Defense subjectonly to certain exemptions and those exemptions are limited only to thefiscal years for which procurement is to be made. So to say that you are going to have <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>co<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mpetition and pick two shipyards for a $20 billionprogram from here on out is not possible under the Comptiton in ContractingAct. So I ask my colleagues to remember, Mr. President, the position of theSenator from Maine <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>in<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the Senate Armed Services Committee that there hasbeen an op<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>en<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> competition for this program. There has not. Andthe Competition in Contracting Act would prevent that. It is not legal.It is not proper under the Competition in Contracting Act to make exemptionsfrom free and open competition for anything more than the one procurementfor which the RFP is submitted. Mr. President, is the Navy asking for this change in the law which is submittedin the Senate Armed Services Committee bill? The answer is no, Mr. President.Under Secretary Costello for Acquisition was asked about that at the DefenseAppropriations Subcommittee. I asked him as follows. Dr. Costello said it would be perhaps better toensure that we have adequate competition in the qualified bidders. [S16MY8-95]{S5883}<ITAG tagnum="21">Senator <T4>Johnston. </T4>All right, and that is proceeding now with proper competition?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dr. <T4>Costello. </T4>To my knowledge, it is, yes. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Senator <T4>Johnston. </T4>In other words, there is no need to change the law nowwith respect to that DDG-51? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dr. <T4>Costello. </T4>I would say I do not see any need to change the law.No, sir. </ITAG>The Under Secretary for acquisition for the Navy says there is no needto change the law, that the competition is going adequately. Assistant Secretary Everett Pyatt for Shipbuilding, I have talked to himinformally. I do not have him on the record. But he has said the presentlaw is going fine. The Navy is seeking to gather up competitive bids forthe three DDG-51's now provided in the RFP. Mr. President, if the competition is going along fine under the presentlaw, what are we worried about? Why are we worried about the phrase ``orother requirements of the Navy?'' We are worried about this for one reason:If we spend $1.5 million and several months submitting a bid and turn outto be the low bidder, we do not know who the new administration is goingto be. It may be a Bush administration, it may be a Dukakis administration,or it may even be a Jesse Jackson administration. But whoever is in thereas the next President, we do not know who the Secretary of the Navy willbe, who the Under Secretary for Acquisition will be, or who the AssistantSecretary will be, and what idea they have about ``other requirements.''They may well provide or decide that ``other requirements'' means geographic,or it may mean anything in the world. Consequently, we may have spent,in an area that has 12 percent unemployment_that is, the State of Louisianamay have spent_$1.5 million and many months trying to acquire somethingfor which they had no chance to begin with. Mr. President, our position is very clear. First, it is in the nationalinterest to have free and open competition. It will get you the lowestprice among qualified bidders. Understand, Mr. President, that under the present rules_in other words,you have to be qualified to submit a bid_48 code Federal regulations, partI, defines the phrase ``responsible contractor.'' It means having the necessarytechnical skills, the necessary production, construction, and technicalequipment and facilities to perform the contract. So, even without this language, bidding is limited, as the Navy wishesto qualify people, to qualified contractors, then, who have the technicalability to bid the contract. We are willing to accept that test, and thatought to be a proper test. But if we are a qualified bidder and we submitthe lowest price, we submit that we or Bath or any other contractor oughtto have the right to get that bid. That is what the law presently says.There is no reason at all to change the present law. I yield the floor. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="1">1The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We determine who can do the best job by competition,by throwing out a proposal and saying whoever can build it the best andfor the cheapest price is going to get the job.That is what we are trying to put back into the Navy destroyer program.The amendment of Senator <T4>Johnston,</T4> in which I join him, simply says that we are going toask for bids and let the Navy decide based on who can come up with thebest price, who can come up with the best schedule, and who can come upwith the best performance.I ask my fellow colleagues what is wrong with that? What is wrong withsaying that the Navy can limit competition only if they can show they aregoing to have a better cost, better price, and better performance, or abetter schedule as a result of limiting competition?If they cannot show that, then qualified American shipyards should be ableto bid. That is the only thing this amendment is about. It is to say thatthe qualified shipyards, whether they are in California or whether theyare in Washington State or whether they are in Maine or in Virginia, orwhether they are in any other State that has a shipyard, that they oughtto be able to participate, they ought to be able to come in and say, ``Wethink we can do it better than anybody else.''The Navy says we do not want that kind of competition, it is too different,we want to say there are only two shipyards that can possibly bid.The amendment of Sen<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>at<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>or <T4>Johnston</T4> says that is wrong, that we ought to get back to allowingfor open competition and let the free market determine which shipyard canbuild and if a Louisiana shipyard cannot compete on the price, on performance,or on schedule, they should not be considered for the job. But do not slamthe door in the face of the shipyards of America before the competitioneven begins. Do not tell them that they cannot even participate becausesome bureaucrat has determined that they would like it a different way.Mr. President, the shipyards in America are folding right and left. Thestatistics are frightening. We have lost 76 shipbuilding and repair firmssince 1982. We have lost over 52,000 American workers in American shipyardsbecause people are building ships in foreign yards.But we have said do not worry, shipyards, we are going to preserve theNavy work for you to make sure we keep an industrial base in the Americanshipyard industry.What does the Navy do? They say, well, we are only going to let two shipyardsbid.The argument on behalf of the Navy is that we have already had competition,and indeed they did run a competitive competition for the first three ships.And let me tell you what happened. The first ship went to Bath. They hadthe best proposal. The second ship went to Ingalls. And then the Navy writesin the contract if Baths does not get the second one, do not worry, Bath,we are going to give you the third one; do not worry, Bath, we are goingto give it to you for whatever price you submit.Let me show you the numbers as to what happened. For the third ship Bathsubmitted an initial bid of $282 million. On the second ship, Ingalls submitteda bid of about $162 million. Avondale from Lou<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>is<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>iana had submitted a second bid of about $180 million.But guess who got it? The high bidder.Eventually the Navy had to bring them down to a price of about $189.9 millionwhich was still almost $28 million more than the other bids.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Is that the kind of competition we can stand up and be proud of? Is thatthe kind of competition that produces the best cost and the best price_$28million more than the low bid?  The only thing that the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Jo<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>hnston amendment is saying is let competition decidewho is going to get the work. And what is wrong with competition? It isas American as apple pie, and that is one way we can prevent the $100 hammersand $100 toilet seats, by saying anybody who can do the work has as a rightto try and get the job and let the one who can do it the best with thebest price for the best performance get the work.  That is what this authorization bill is all about. That is what Senator<T4>Johnston's </T4>amendment does, and I cannot understand how anybodycan say we are so much against competition that we are going to have toreserve work for a company without freely competing and let the low companyget the job.  So I join with the senior Senator from Louisiana and congratulate him forhis perseverance in this area.  Every chance he has had he brought this issue up as it should be, whetheron a continuing resolution or on the authorization bill.  Let us bring competition back to the Navy and his amendment does that. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yie<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>lds<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> time?  [S16MY8-119]{S5886}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield myself just 1 minute to make one pointwhich is crucial to this.  It has been said that there has been a competition or that there have beentwo competitions. That is correct, Mr. President, there have been two competitions.But under the Competition in Contracting <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Act,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the only competition that can be had under the lawis the competition for the ships under consideration for that particularprocurement.  The two competitions that were held, the first one was in 1985 for oneship. The second one for fiscal year 1987 was for two ships. There hasnot been a competition for the whole program. There cannot be a competitionfor ships as yet unsubmitted for bid because the competition in contractinglaw, Mr. President, provides that there shall be an RFP with free and opencompetition for each new procurement.  The Navy could have submitted the whole program of 30 destroyers all inone program and had one bid for it. They did not do so. They submittedfirst one ship and then a separate procurement in fiscal year 1987 fortwo ships.  So, Mr. President, there has not been a competition to limit this t<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o 2 <CODE-213>0</CODE-213> shipyards for 30 ships. There has been a competitionto limit it to two shipyards only with respect to the two ships in fiscalyear 1987.  Moreover, Mr. President, it would be a grave mistake to change the lawto say that after bids are in you can come in and restrict competition.I mean, you can see, Mr. President, just by the numbers we are lookig athere. Avondale was almost $100 million, well, $89 million less than Bathon the second ship. Can you imagine, if you have 30 ships, how much thismight cost the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>U.S.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Government?  Bath, Mr. President, is a shipyard that is thought to be in some trouble.Just in the Defense News of Monday, April 18, 1988, it stated:[S16MY8-120]{S5886}<ITAG tagnum="21">The Navy had hoped to build about five ships per year, but cost anddesign problems at Bath have led to a nearly 10-month delay in the constructionschedule and the lead ship is not expected to be delivered to the Navyuntil mid-1990.</ITAG>My colleagues will recall that Bath had a leveraged buy-out and may bein some difficulty. We also know that these are the OSH<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>A<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> violations at Bath for which they had to pay over$1 million in fines.Mr. President, I hope Bath has its problems straightened out, and it maywell have those problems straightened out. But the fact of the matter isto come in and try to get a shipyard which might be in trouble, limitingcompetition, as we are, to two shipyards, one of which might be in trouble,could cost this Federal Government billions and billions of dollars.If they could compete, let them compete openly and fairly and not, Mr.President, to come in with the competition which has some vague languagelike ``or other requirements.''And I will repeat during this argument today that I hope somebody willtell us what this means: ``or other requirements.'' Because under thisamendment, as put forth in the Senate Armed Services Committee bill, youget a chance to bid all right, but the Secretary of the Navy can come inwith ``othe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> requirements'' as determined by the Secretary of<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>the <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Navy after the bidding is over with. So it is theclassic <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ca<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tch-22. As I said earlier, it is like my daughter said, when she wanted to borrowthe credit card: ``I want to buy <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>sweater and stuff'' and the and ``stuff'' turnedout to cost more than the sweater. The other requirements here are likelyto turn out to mean, ``Yeah, you had a right to bid but you really cannotbid unless you are f<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>rom<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the State of Maine.'' That is what is involved here.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. <T4>Shel<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>by<CODE-213>0</CODE-213></T4>). Who yields time?[S16MY8-121]{S5886}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senatorfrom Texas.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>The PRESIDING OFFICER. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The Senator from Texas is recognized for 2 minutes.[S16MY8-122]{S5886}GRAMMMr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think the issue we are talking about here isa thoroughly narrow one. It really bo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ils<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> down, as I see it, to these three words: ``or otherrequirements.''In committee, we looked at the concern that if we open competition, didthat commit the Government to any binding contracts, or tooling and otherexpenditures, to the shipyards. Knowing, that if we had to build up tools,that unless the savings from the additional yard coming on line were greaterthan the cost of tooling or supervising it, that we could lose money eventhough it might look like we were ga<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>in<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ing money. So we have a provision in here that protectsus against that. It seems to me, therefore, that we have already dealt with the really legitimateconcern about the third shipyard. I think, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>in<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> these questions, where we have doubt about how weought to operate, that our natural inclination ought to always be towardcompetition. I think with the protection we have that we are not goingto be entering into a contract that is going to cost us more than we gain.I think we ought to open it up for more competition. This is why I supportthe amendment of the Senator from Louisiana.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?[S16MY8-123]{S5886}STENNISMr. STENNIS.

Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from Louisianais just the latest chapter in a series of efforts made by one shipyardto use the Congress to micromanage the procurement action by the Navy inits contracts for the DDG-51 <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>De<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>stroyer <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Pr<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ogram.Now, I make no reference to individual <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Me<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mbers of this body<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>, of<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> course, who are acting in good faith.Competition is really not the issue, Mr. President. I am not an expertin this field, but I have been here these years and have exercised an activeinterest in it to more than just a minor degree during each of those years.There are a lot of companies that are the very finest and best shipbuildersin the world. I am very proud of what share of that is in my <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>St<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ate, and other States the same way. I am proud ofthe attitude<ITAG tagnum="80">on the part of this body and the House of Representatives to see thatright is done, that competition is allowed, and that all have an opportunity. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>So let us not fool each other and criticize eachother. Competition is not really the issue here, <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Mr. President<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. There has already been competition, more than once.In fact, the Navy on two separate occasions conducted a competition<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> and<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> it was generally understood by all shipyards participatingthat the results of that competition would be used by the Navy in awardingfuture contracts for the construction of the destroyers. It was furtherunderstood that once two shipyards were selected for participation in theDDG-51 <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Pr<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ogram, future competition on the construction ofthis class of destroyers would be between those two yards.  <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>There are just not enough of these destroyers inthe Navy program to justify the participation of more than two shipyards. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>As a result of the competition previously held in1985 and 1987, two shipyards were selected by the Navy to participate inthe <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>De<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>stroyer <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Co<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nstruction <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Pr<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ogram_Bath in the State of Maine and Litton in Mississippi. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The shipyard in Louisiana participated in the biddingprocess but was not selected.  <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>In spite of this prior competit<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ion<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, last year during consideration of the Defense appropriationsbill in the House of Representatives, an ame<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nd<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ment was adopted which had been offered by Congressman<T4>Livingston </T4>of Louisiana, requiring additional competition forthe 1989 <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>De<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>stroyer <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Co<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nstruction <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Pr<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ogram with even an addition<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>al<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> mandate that <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> third shipyard be given a contract in the program.This was done in spite of the fact that all interested shipyards had theopportunity to bid in the two competitions already held.  <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>There was no similar provision in the Senate appropriationsbill last year, and in conference with the House, a provision was agreedupon which did require additional competition for the 1989 <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>De<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>stroyer <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Co<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nstruction <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Pr<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ogram, but did not require that an award be madeto a third yard.  <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The provision inserted in the Defense appropriationsbill which became a part of the continuing resolution last December wasreally not a proper subject for the Appropriations Committee, but its inclusionin the bill resulted because of the action of the House of Representativesin approving that particular provision. As Senators will recall, we workedmany days and often late into the night reaching final agreement on theDefense appropriations bill and ultimately the continuing resolution. WhileI did not feel that the matter offered by the Congressman from Louisianahad any place in the appropriations bill, it was already there when thebill reached the Senate and had to be dealt with in the House-Senate conference.A compromise which was reached was agreed to which now needs to be corrected. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Therefore, we are faced again with this issue. TheNavy has steadfastly taken the position that the competition has alreadybeen held, and it should be permitted to utilize the results of the competitionin awarding the contracts for the entire <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Co<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nstruction <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Pr<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ogram for dest<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>oyers of this class, as was anticipated by the Navyand all the interested shipyards when the competition was held. Of course,the two successful bidders already selected will compete for the contractsfor the destroyers in each year's <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Co<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nstruction <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Pr<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ogram. I certainly agree with the soundness of thisposition.May I have the remaining time, please?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi's time has expired.[S16MY8-127]{S5887}STENNISMr. STENNIS. Will the Senator allow me 2 more minutes?[S16MY8-128]{S5887}COHENMr. COHEN.

The Senator from Mississippi is recognized for anadditional 2 minutes.[S16MY8-129]{S5887}STENNISMr. STENNIS. The House, in the military authorization bill for fiscal year1989, repealed the provision requiring additional competition for theseships among all yards.Let me say this again. I have not rendered any big service here but I havebeen through hundreds and hundreds of these committee meetings over theyears. There is a sense of fairness. There is a sense of competition. Thereis a sense of a pattern of operations that is fair and splendid, and ithas reared a fine group of high production workers that almost take theprize throughout the Nation in many ways.In the military authorization bill for fiscal year 1989, the Senate ArmedServices Committee adopted a provision recognizing the importance of continuedcompetition, but adopted compromise language giving the Secretary of theNavy some discretion in considering overall costs, schedule, performance,and other requirements of the Navy in deciding whether there would be additionalcompetition with a report to Congress and review by the General AccountingOffice.Mr. President, I am saying I have been impressed with the considerationof these matters, emphasizing, again, the fairness of it and chance tohave competition, the chance to get a job and get the work done; the chanceto get a splendid ship built. Let us not overlook our own national interest,our own national viewpoint of need.We must, we just absolutely must, proceed here with a competent, able groupof men and women in those fields. That must continue.In my time in the Senate, I have conducted many hearings, and been involvedin a great number of procurement programs by the Department of Defense.Certainly competition is a healthy thing, and every qualified person orcompany should have the opportunity to participate in providing militaryequipment to our <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>De<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>fense <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>De<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>partment.

I think it is simply incorrect for any aspersion to be left asa result of this debate about the quality, the ability of the people ofthat yard to construct ships. They have been doing it for many decadesand doing it well, as the Navy can indicate.I think that is really what this gets down to. Do we trust the U.S. Navyto cond<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ct a shipbuilding program in accordance with law?Or are we going to say that when a decision is made by the Navy that someSenator does not like because his yard does not win we are going to overturnit through the political process? That is really the issue here. Competitionhas not been the issue.There has been competition_a fair, open competition_which everybody understoodbefore it occurred. And if that process was unfair or wrong, protests shouldhave been made at the outset, not after the process is over, not afterone yard lost, not after the decision has been made.Mr. President, I urge the Members of the Senate to reject this amendmentand to observe it for what it is. It is not an effort to promote competition.I yield the remainder of my time.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?[S16MY8-146]{S5888}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.[S16MY8-147]{S5888}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. On this question of the prior competition, will the Senatornot agree with me that the RFP's, which were submitted, were not for a30-ship program, but were for a 2-ship program in the case of the RFP submittedfor fiscal year 1987 and for a 1-ship program in the case of the RFP submittedin 1985. Am I correct on that?[S16MY8-148]{S5888}MITCHELLMr. MITCHELL. It is very clear that the program was intended to establisha lead and a follow-on yard. And that while the Senator is correct thatit was limited as he stated, there is no doubt, considering the mannerin which the shipbuilding programs have been conducted, which everybodyunderstood, that once those yards were established, we are going to proceedto construct the remainder of the ships in those two yards, depending uponthe number of ships that might in the future be available.[S16MY8-149]{S5888}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Point No. 2: <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>he Senator said it is an established procedure tohave a lead and follow-on yard. But does the Senator know that at least,with other kinds of programs where you have a lead and follow-on yard,for example, the TAO <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>P<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rogram, which<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>is an oiler program which Avondale_I think they arethe follow-on yard, they are the follow-on yard, but it does not limitcompetition with respect to that. Will the Senator agree with me that alead and follow-on yard does not mean you limit competition to those twoshipyards?[S16MY8-150]{S5888}MITCHELLMr. MITCHELL. TAO oilers can be built in every American shipyard limitedonly by space. The surface combatants, like the destroyer program, arehighly specialized, only built in three yards. Indeed, it is my understandingthat the Avondale yard has never built a missile-firing surface combatantof the type being described here.[S16MY8-151]{S5888}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. But the Senator does agree that the TAO <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s not limited?[S16MY8-152]{S5888}MITCHELLMr. MITCHELL. I agree it is not limited because there is no need to limitit. It can be built in every yard in the country limited only by space.[S16MY8-153]{S5888}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Exactly.[S16MY8-154]{S5888}MITCHELLMr. MITCHELL. And it is unlike this program. There is no analogy whatsoever.[S16MY8-155]{S5888}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. The final question: Can the Senator enlighten us on whatthis means: ``Our other requirements''?[S16MY8-156]{S5888}MITCHELLMr. MITCHELL. That is not my amendment.[S16MY8-157]{S5888}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Mr. Presisent, I yield myself 2 minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.[S16MY8-158]{S5889}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. I am glad my distinguished friend from Maine has narrowedthis issue. As he pointed out, Mr. President, there was a competition,but the competition was limited <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> two ships in 1987. There is this leap, Mr. President,You have one competition in 1985 for one ship. You have another competitionin 1987 for two ships, and then after that comes in, then after that competitionis over, on August 31 of 1987, my shipyard received a letter and says,``Aha, we were not talking about three ships, we were talking about thewhole program.''Now, how are we supposed to know that it was the whole program? It wasnot in the request for propo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>sa<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ls. It would be illegal under the competition incontracting act to do it that way. It is a catch-22. After the bids arein, then they say we are talking about the whole program.So, Mr. President, it is not allowed under the act. T<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>he<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>re is no need at all to change the present law. Thepresent law, which was incorporated in the Approprations Act last year,was worked out with Ingalls Shipyard, which agreed that that was OK withthe Mississippi delegation. We all agreed. We thought we had this thingsettled. Free and open competition was going to be the rule of the gamefor the ne<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>xt<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> year. There is no case at all made, Mr. President,that that should be changed.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?[S16MY8-159]{S5889}BREAUXMr. BREAUX. Will the Senator from Louisiana yield me <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>2 <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>minutes?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Louisiana is recognizedfor 2 minutes.[S16MY8-160]{S5889}BREAUXMr. BREAUX. I just wanted to follow up on what the Senator from Louisianapointed out. That is<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>, <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>why was nobody objecting earl<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ie<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>r? The simple reason is earlier there was open competition.In 1985 when they had competition for one ship<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>, <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Avondale lost. Avondale did not try and change thatdecison because they had a right to compete.Only in 1987, after the third ship was granted automatically to one shipyardand the Navy came in and said that all future ships that we are going tobuild are going to be closed competition, that we decided it was improperand inappropriate to follow that type of a program.So when the competition was open, nobody was complaining, despite the factour shipyard in Louisisana lost. But when the Navy came in <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>in <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>1987 and said that is it, no more competition forthe rest of the program, those of us who looked at what was happen<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ing<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> to the bids said that is not right.The open competition the Navy said they <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>had<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> resulted in the third ship costing almost $28 millionmore than the low bids on the first and second ship. Is that the kind ofprogram we want to run in this country when budget numbers are tight, whenwe have a limited amount of dollars left in the defense appropriations?We should be getting the biggest bang for the buck. The only way to ensurethat is to provide for open competition and let the shipyard who does thebest job at the best price, the best delivery schedule get the contracts.Tht is all the Johnston amendment does.It says, let us have a little competition around for a change; let us stopthe $10 hammers and $200 toilet seats.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> L<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>et the best competitor get the business. When welose fairly, no problem. Do not say we cannot even come to the field andcompete. Do not say only a selected few can participate in the game.The Johnston amendment says competition is good for the Navy, as it isfor every other segment of the United States.So I think a vote for the Johnston amendment is a vote to save this DefenseDepartment some money, to ensure that they get a bigger bang for the buck.If you want the ships to cost more, vote against Johnston. If you wantthe ships to cost less and get more for our dollar, support the Jo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nston amendment.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?[S16MY8-161]{S5889}COHENMr. COHEN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time that I may consume.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Maine.[S16MY8-162]{S5889}COHENMr. COHEN. Mr. President, there has been a good deal of confusion injectedinto this debate. I think my colleague from Maine, Senator <T4>Mitchell,</T4> phrased it quite appropriately. He said this is notthe competition in contracting amendment or a vote for good competitionin our shipbuilding program. It is a sore loser amendment.As I listen to the debate, I am tempted, and I may do it, as a matter offact, Mr. President, I may at the conclusion of this debate give what theauthors and sponsors of this amendment really want. If they want a chanceto compete under the law, then I would offer to strike all the provisionsthat we put in to accommodate them, the provisions that the Navy has tocertify that it will result in lower total costs to the United States,that it is necessary to meet the cost schedule, performance, or other requirements,that there be a GAO certification, Navy certification, I will offer tostrike all of that and simply say that the Secretary of the Navy shallprovide for the construction of the shipbuilding portion of the DDG-51destroyer program in fiscal year 1989 through full and open competitionas provided in chapter 137 of title 10, United States Code, section 18of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act. That is the Competitionin Contracting Act.Now, if anyone is in favor of competition, we can go on record and juststrike everything that we tried to do to accommodate the Senator from Louisianaand simply allow the Navy to compete under the Competition in ContractingAct, and I may very well offer my amendment at the end of the debate.I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Mississippi.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Mississippi.[S16MY8-163]{S5889}COCHRANMr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Mainefor yielding to me. When the distinguished Senator from Alaska was on thefloor, he observed that language was includ<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ed<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> in the continuing resolution for appropriationslast year dealing with this subject.I will take a few minutes to try to explain to the Senate the legislativehistory of this controversy to try to put in perspective what is goingon right now on the floor of the Senate.Since Senators have already discussed the contents of the request for proposalwhich the Navy issued when this program was begun and when bids were firstmade by competing shipyards in 1985, I will not describe details of theprogram<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> bidding.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> I think what happened when the bidding was over<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> however<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> should be of particular interest to the Senate.Avondale in Louisiana, Ingalls Shipbuilding in Mississippi, Bath Ironworksin Maine, and others submitted bids to con<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>truct the first <T3>Arleigh Burke</T3> guided missile dest<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ro<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>yer, DDG-51. Everyone in the industry knew this wasone of the largest programs ever bidded upon in the history of the Navyand in the history of shipbuilding in the United States. Over 20 shipswere comtemplated for this program, and winning that competition was consideredextremely important. There were two winners, and there were some losers.The two winners were Bath Ironworks and Ingalls Shipbuilding.After the competition was over, there was an effort in the legislativeprocess to reopen the bidding by means of an amendment to the appropriationsbill in the House of Representatives, offered by a Congressman from Louisiana,which directed the Navy to reopen the bidding and to select a third shipyardto participate in this program.That was the legislative effect of the adoption of that amendment in theHouse of Representatives in the Appropriations Committee, and that provisionsurvived the House. In the Senate no similar provision was included, andso in conference last year on the continuing resolution<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> we had to deal with this provision mandating bylaw the selection of a third shipyard for this program.In the negotiations, which involved this Senator, Senator <T4>Stevens, </T4>Senator <T4>S<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ennis, </T4>Senator <T4>Johnston,</T4> and others, along with conferees on the part of theHouse, we wrestled long into the night on whether we were going to permitthe Congress by law to direct the Navy to select a third yard.A compromise was reached<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and a sentence was included in the provision attachedto the House language stating that, although the Navy really did not haveto select a third y<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ar<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d, it did have to open up the bidding in 1989.The practical effect of that compromise continues today. Senators and lawyerscan disagree on the meaning of the words and other considerations, butas I understand it the Navy feels constrained by that language, and Senatorsthink that the Competition <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>in<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Contracting Act has been amended in an appropriationsbill at the instance of the House but modified in conference with the participationof some of the Senators here.Now, what has happened this year? In the authorization process, the billfrom the House Armed Services Committee included a committee amendmentthat repealed the conference language from the appropriations bill lastyear and in effect rendered operative the Competition in Contracting Actof 1984 without any amendment from the appropriations process. It justput the law where it was after the adoption of the 1984 Competition inContracting Act.When the bill got to the floor, a Congressman from Louisiana was goingto offer an amendment to strike the House language. The House Rules Committeeruled that such an amendment would be out of order, how<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ev<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>er, and it was not offered.We come now to the Senate. Although the bill from the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee retained language similar to last years appropriations compromise,the distinguished senior Senator from Louisiana proposes an amendment tomodify that provision again. I think Senators have a right to know whatthe p<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>rac<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tical effect of that modification would be. My interpretation,and it may differ from others, is that it would strength<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>en<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the mandate of last year's appropriations bill andcould be interpreted as requiring by law the selection of a third yardby the Navy. That is the issue. Are we going to permit the Navy to continueto enjoy some flexibility under the law or are we going <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>permit the Congress, each time there is a competitionand there are dissatisfied bidders, to direct the Navy or the Air Forceor the Army in the details of compliance with the Competition in ContractingAct?I think this is dangerous territory, Mr. President, for us to try to choosesides between well-liked, well-respected Senators, who have the best ofmotivations to try to manage the competition program of the Armed Serviceson the floor of the Senate, as we are being called upon to do today.We have a law on the subject, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.Let us stick with that law. It was carefully drafted. Let <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>us <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>not try to inject new provisions and wrin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>kl<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>es that might have the effect of perferring one shipyardover another or second-guessing the decisions made by the managers of theseprograms. Let us use our regular oversight authority. If we think therehas been a violation of the 1984 law, let us have a hearing. Let the ArmedServices Committee bring in the Navy and ask them about the way this programhas been submitted to the industry.If there have been violations, let us discuss them. If there is an aggrievedyard, I am sure the courts will take into account any proof that the Navyhas violated the law or has not dealt fairly with a bidder. We see thathappen from time to time.This is not the place, Mr. President, for us to try to resolve this dispute.It could probably be handled much better for all concerned in another forum.I hope the arguments made by the distinguished Senators from Maine, Mr.<T4>Cohen </T4>and Mr. <T4>Mitchell, </T4>will be reviewed carefully by the Senate. If the Senatorfrom Maine offers an amendment,<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I hope we will vote for his amendment. If he doesnot, we can vote to reject the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I assume and understand Senator <T4>Helms </T4>has been on the floor and he will probably be ready to bringthose up which appears to me to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 12:40or 12:45. Those amendments are going to take a good bit of debate and time.We have an order for 3 o'clock I believe on the D'Amato amendment relatingto drug offenses and capital punishment. That will take about an hour aspreviously agreed on, at least to get to a tabling motion. Then we have about seven or eight other amendments that we understand willbe called up. So we need people to understand that they should be alertat least after 4 o'clock and about 7 if we are going to get through hereat a reasonable hour this evenying, to get their amendments to the floor,and to make sure we have no lapse time here.I do assume that we will go with the Helms amendments right after thisone; also, the Domenici verification amendment, 28 minutes equally divided.That one may cause a rollcall vote. So I would ask if Senator <T4>Helms </T4>and his staff could get in touch with us and let us knowtheir intention, and also Senator <T4>Domenici </T4>on his as to when he would prefer to bring that up. I thank the Chair. [S16MY8-169]{S5890}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. President, we have had so much talk here about what sounds like somethingcomplicated which really is not. The real issue here is two things: firstof all, whether this phrase ``or other requirements'' should be part ofthis amendment; second, whether or not you are going to put on other requirementswhether they ought to be put on after the bids are received or before thebids are received. Let me be more specific. The change in the law as presently contained inthe <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>enate Armed Services Committee bill says in effectthere shall be competition unless the Secretary certifies that limitingcompetition would result in a lower total cost to the United States oris necessary to meet the cost schedule performance or other requirementsof the Navy. Mr. President, in the Armed Service<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Committee meeting_and I was there_the argument wasthat you should not have this free and open competition because to getanother shipyard in the process would cost the Navy additional money. Theyalso said that second shipyard might not be qualified or it might delaythe program. So this amendment takes care of that. I think it is provided for underthe <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>F<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ederal rules anyway. In fact, I know it is. I justread that into the <T4>Record. </T4>This amendment clearly provides for any question of costor qualifications or time. It clearly states that. That is not at issuehere. What is at issue is the second requirements, which says ``is <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><G7./>1S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>0634<ITAG tagnum="80">necessary to meet other requirements of the Navy determined by theSecretary.''  <CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG>Mr. President, <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>we have gone on here for over an hour. I have askedrepeatedly from the start what does this mean. It obviously has no meaning.It is obvious that this phrase in the Senate Armed Services Committee billis meant really to excl<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ude<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> competition. It is meant to seek to give you competitionwith one hand but to take it away with the other hand.  <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The second part of this amendm<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nt says that these bids which should be received_actually,the RFP's are set to go out next month. The bids would be received shortlythereafter. Our amen<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>dment<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> simply says that you do not exclude the bids untilthey are received. You do not come up with requirements until you knowwhat the bids are. In other words, if you are going to say there is noway that someone could commit to a lower bid, there is no way you can makethat determination until you actually receive the bids.  <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Mr. President, <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>we did in fact work this matter out as the distinguishedS<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tor from Mississippi said. He was part of the negotiation.I was. It was difficult. It was a negotiation among friends and neighbors,allies. And we worked it out. I thought it was worked out to everyone'ssatisfaction, including the shipyard in Mississippi, Inga<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ls, and including the shipyard in Louisiana. No oneliked it too much. But it provided for a narrow competition for 1 year. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>This amendment, while talking in terms of savingthe Navy money, really cloaks through with this clever use of language``or other requirements,'' and just does away with that competition altogether.  <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>It is a $20 bi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>lion program. There has been no competition for the$20 billion program prior to this_competition for the two ships in 1987,of course, and competition for the one ship in 1985, of course. Everyoneconcedes that. But there is no competition for the total program. Thereshould not have been a competition for the total program because <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>w<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e did not know how many ships and when they <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>w<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ere going to be asked for, and what the conditionwas going to be at that time.  <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I ask my colleagues, <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Mr. President<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>.

Having conferred with the Parliamentarian, I understand that itis not possible to offer an amendment to delete all reference to the DDG-51program. I still believe that the compromise we reached in the 1988 appropriationsbill is correct.I say to my friends, without regard to where they stand, that no matterwhat we do on this bill, it is coming back again to us under the appropriationsbill. The House put the provision in the appropriations bill that mandateda third contract to build destroyer. We will face that again in the appropriationsbill. We settled it in the conference on the continuing resolution, andI ask unanimous consent to have that provision printed in the <T4>Record.</T4>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the<T4>Record,</T4> as follows:[S16MY8-176]{S5891}shipbuildi<ITAG tagnum="89">shipbuilding and conversion, navy</ITAG>[S16MY8-177]{S5891}<ITAG tagnum="21">DDG-51 destroyer program, $5,500,000: <T3>Provided,</T3> That contracts awarded for any DDG-51 class destroyersin fiscal year 1989 shall be made on the basis of a full and open competitionamong all technically qualified bidders regardless of prior contractualexperience for construction of DDG-51 destroyers.

We have 2 minutes remaining. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has 2 minutes and 26seconds. Who yields time? [S16MY8-182]{S5891}COHENMr. COHEN. Mr. President, as the Senator from Louisiana has characterizedit, it is a simple issue. What has happened, however, is that it has been clouded by the argumentsoffered by the Senators from Louisiana on the words ``other requirements.''As I tried to point out earlier, under the Competition in Contracting Act,which Senator <T4>Levin </T4>and I helped to write, to become part of the law, the Secretaryof the Navy, the head of an agency, could limit competition to one solesource for construction of that destroyer if he determined that it wasin the public interest to do so. That is what the Competition in ContractingAct allows for_an exemption specifically directed to allow the head ofan ag<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ncy to certify to Congress that, with the interestsof the public to be served, there be only one source for that contract.Here we have the Secretary of the Navy competing_open, full, fair competition.So, for those who argue that it is not open to competition, it is misleading.Second, I indicated that I would be happy to strike all the language Iconstructed in an effort to satisfy the Senator from Louisiana. As to the provisions that would require the Secretary of the Navy to havemore competition unless he certifies that it would result in lower cost,meet the other requirements of the Navy_I offered in the committee to havethe GAO make a certification to Congress. But nothing seems enough to satisfythe Senator from Louisiana. His colleague has indicated that the Navy will save. The Navy has estimatedthat it will incur additio<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nal<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> costs of about $22 million.The Secretary of the Navy says:<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>[S16MY8-183]{S5891}<ITAG tagnum="21">The current shipbuilding plan provides for three DDG-51's in FY-89,increasing to a level of five per year in subsequent years.

If futureDDG-51 <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>construction levels should rise to seven ships ayear, the Navy <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>could then add a third yard.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213></ITAG>The Secretary of the Navy acted <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>in<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> behalf of the interests of this country on all theprograms the Senator from Louisiana has cited; the Aegis cruiser, the FFGprogram, the SSN-688, the SSN-21.

The Navyis getting ready to consider building 26 additional destroyers. That iswhat we are talking about. Should we limit the competition to only twoshipyards, or should say that any qualified American shipyard that is technicallyqualified has the right to submit <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>bid and that the low bidder who can do the job willget the job? That is what the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>J<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ohnston amendment assures.  <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The other side says that the Navy has already hadcompetition on the first three. That is the problem this amendm<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nt addresses. The way they were handled, particularlythe third ship, will cost the American taxpayer almost $28 million forthe destroyers' commission.  <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The third ship bid that was submitted by Bath isalmost $28 million more than the previous low bid on the second ship. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The Navy said, ``We already had competition.'' Thatcompetition is killing us. That is the kind of competition that causesus to pay hundreds of dollars for hammers and toilet seats. That is whatis wrong with the process. That is why the Johnston amendment_if we areconcerned about getting the biggest bang for the buck in the Defense Department_isso important. It says that on the next 26 ships, we will have open andfull competition.  <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The Johnston amendment says that if the Navy feelsthat it is necessary in the future to limit competition, they can do soif it is necessary to meet the costs, the schedule, or the performancerequirements of the Navy. Is that not enough for the other shipyards whowant to limit competition?  <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>In other words, the Johnston amendment clearly saysthat if they want to limit competition and it is going to be cost effectiveor important for the schedule of delivery or for the performance, theycan do it. But if it does not give us a better cost bid, if it does notgive us a better schedule or does not give us better performance, theycannot do it.That is all the Johnston amendment does. The Johnston amendment says thisnebulous term ``or other requirements,'' whatever they may be, should notbe part of the law of the United States.Vote for the Johnston amendment for competition in this country.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.Who yields time?The Senator from Maine has 2 minutes and 15 seconds.[S16MY8-186]{S5892}COHENMr. COHEN. Mr. President, I would simply respond, as I <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ndicated before, that if the Senators from Louisianawere only interested in free and open competition, they would have acceptedmy proposal to strike all the language and just subject the entire biddingprocess to the Competition in Contracting Act.They obviously were not interested in doing that and, therefore, are notinterested in free and open competition according to that particular law.I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Maine.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Maine.[S16MY8-187]{S5892}MITCHELLMr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, there is a very simple issue here. It is whether<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>na<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>val shipbuilding contracts are to be decided by theNavy under law or to be decided through the political process here on theSenate floor.The Navy has conducted an open competitive process on this shipbuildingprogram that is the same as its process followed on the frigate program,the cruiser program, and the 688 class submarine program which saved thetaxpayers of this country billions of dollars.Not once did the Senator from Louisiana protest the use of that competitiveprocess in those programs.The Navy then initiated in 1985 the same competitive process on the destroyerprogram. Not once did the Senator from Louisiana protest that process.Only now, after the yard in Louisiana has lost in that open competition,not once, but twice, only now do they come in and say we want to changethe process, we want to change the rules, we want to write into law a processthat will get our yard a contract, that they cannot win in the open competitiveprocess. And that is the only issue here.Are our Navy contracts, our military contracts, going to be decided asa result of the raw political process or are they going to be decided pursuantto law as the Navy has done it?There has not been a single allegation here that the Competition in ContractingAct has been violated in any way. And it has not. The Navy has adheredto the law. It has saved the taxpayers billions of dollars and now a processwhich has been used successfully in three other major programs is underchallenge here because one yard lost.This is not a competition amendment. This is a sore loser amendment andif we approve<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>this process then we can expect every losing competitorin a military contract from now on to come into here and ask that the rulesbe changed so that they can get a contract, and that is the issue beforeus.[S16MY8-188]{S5892}HEFLINMr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendmentoffered by <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>he Senator from Louisiana, Senator <T4>Johnston</T4>, which, I believe, would place an undue burden on theNavy and unnecessarily micromanage the Navy in procurement of their newdestroyer program.Mr. President, I have, and will remain, an advocate of greater competitionwithin the Defense Department. However, we should not go so far as to unnecessarilymicromanage their activities. This amendment would do just that.The Navy stated and followed through on their acquisition process and alreadyheld extensive competition on this program. The Senator from Louisianais interested in allowing a shipyard from his State to compete in thisprogram. However, the fact is that this shipyard, Avondale, has alreadycompeted twice and was not selected by the Navy on both occasions. Mr.President, there is simply no sense in forcing the Navy to go back andallow competition all over again.The acquisition plan of the Navy for this destroyer program is such thatonly two shipyards would be included in the building process. In carryingout this process, the Navy held a full free and open competition for alead shipyard in the program. As a result, a shipyard located in the Stateof Maine, Bath Iron Works, was selected as the lead shipyard, while theshipyard located in Louisiana was not selected.Then, Mr. President, the Navy held a second full free and open competitionfor a follow-on shipyard for the destroyer program. During this secondopen competition, a shipyard in the State of Mississippi, Ingalls Shipyard,was selected. Again, Mr. President, the Avondale Shipyard was not selectedby the Navy.Now, Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana wants the Avondale Shipyardto compete again on the program after they have lost twice. As I have said,I am not opposed to free and open competition. However, this amendment,at this point in the program, simply goes too far. Mr. President, we shouldnot bring DOD contractual decisions to the floor of the U.S. Senate.The Senate Armed Services Committee has already addressed this matter andtaken care of it. They have included a provision in the bill which wouldrequire the Secretary of the Navy to certify that this is the best andmost cost effective way to proceed with this acquisition plan. If the Secretaryof the Navy cannot make this certification, the program will go the fulland open competition again, and the Avondale Shipyard will get to bid athird time. The committee has also required a GAO report on the matterin order to ensure the cost effectiveness of the plan even further.The Navy has successfully used this process of lead and follow-on shipyardson three other major surface vessel programs in the past. There is simplyno sense in changing this process at this point in the program.Mr. President, we should not do this here on the floor of the Senate. TheNavy has already held two open and fair competitions on this program, andthe winners and losers have been selected. The Senate has no business micromanagingthis proven and successful competitive process at this stage in the gameof this program. At the request of the Senator from Louisiana, the ArmedServices Committee has addressed this matter, and we should let that languagestand. I urge my colleague to reject this amendment.Thank you, Mr. President.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment has been examined by both sidesand approved by both sides, as I understand it, so we will make haste.It is an important amendment. I will not require a rollcall vote on itbecause I think most Senators, if not all, would vote for it in any event.But let me explain the amendment briefly and then we shall see. Mr. President, a number of months ago our distinguished colleague, theSenator from Arkansas, Senator <T4>Bumpers</T4>, alluded during Senate debate a possible American violationof the ABM Treaty. At that time, I asked the distinguished Senator to specify the violationhe had in mind. He did not identify any such violation, and we did notpursue the matter. Now, however, I find myself concurring with the view of the distinguishedSenator that the United States has engaged in a violation of the ABM Treaty.Let me say quickly I think it is not what the Senator had in mind as aviolation, if it is a violation, but we would have to speak to that. In any event, article XIV, paragraph 2 of the ABM Treaty reads as follows_andthe actual text is important because without understanding what it actuallysays some Senators may be misled by the glib arguments and obfuscationsof the State Department lawyers_the provision precisely reads, ``Five yearsafter entry into force of this <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>reaty, and at five-year intervals thereafter, the<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>p<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>arties shall together conduct a review of this <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>reaty.'' Mr. President, the term ``entry into force of this <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>reaty'' is a legal specification of a date certain.The Joint Commitee print entitled ``Legislation on Foreign Relations''on page 69 states categorically that the ABM Treaty_and I quote_``Enteredinto force on October 3, 1972.'' It follows, at least_as Sam Ervin used to say_at least to those who<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>are able to read and understand the English language,that ``five years after'' October 3, 1972, is October 3, 1977, and thatthe date of two 5-year intervals after that date is October 3, 1987. Anyother interpretation is contray to the plain meaning of the English wordsused. In English, a year is the length of time it takes the Earth to orbit theSun. In practical usage, it is either 365 days or 366 days in a leap year.Either way, it is precise and definite. Perhaps the Russian version of a year is different, but I doubt it, andregardless we are, according to the rules a<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d procedures of the Senate, bound by the Englishversion. And the English version is unambiguous. So, Mr. President, the point is this: On October 3, 1987, the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>p<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>arties did not conduct a review of the ABM Treaty,nor did they begin such review, nor did they even set a date for beginningsuch a review. So Senator <T4>Bumpers</T4> was right. The United States violated the ABM Treaty,in my view. They did none of those things, Mr. President, because the United States_theUnited States, not Russia_did not wished to do so. Some may believe thatthe United States wished to avoid this meeting because the a<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ministration would have been required to protestat least one material breach of the ABM Treaty by Russia. Some may believethat the administration may have not wished to discuss a material breachof one treaty amid the then ongoing public relations hype of the proposedINF Treaty. In any case, Mr. President, the treaty said what it said. It said it inplain English. The United Staes of America is in violation of the treatyfor not having conducted this review and I think it is high time that wecorrected this defect and that is the purpose of this amendment. I yield the floor.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. [S16MY8-206]{S5894}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I find myself agreeing virtually completely withthe Senator from North Carolina on this one. I think he has said it verywell. I believe it was originally back on March 2 of this year, and heexpressed these sentiments again this morning, that ``Treaties are to beinterpreted in an interpretation that is in accord with the plain meaningof the English language.'' And I agree with him. He is exactly right. The Senator also said that: ``Sometimes Senators understandably might bemisled by the glib arguments and obfuscation of the State Department lawyers.''I agree with that completely. I have had a few differences with them myselfon what I felt was the plain English language of a treaty. I think the Senator also says, and I agree with him completely, that ``Irefuse to be a yes-man to the U.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. State Department when they start playing fun andgames with what a treaty says and what it means.'' So in all of those statements the Senator and I are in complete accord.And I do agree with the Senator that ``5-year intervals'' means 5-yearintervals. According to my calculations that would be October 3, 1987.I guess the Senator might agree, it is as if you got home one day, it wasyour anniversary, and you forgot it. A day or two goes by and your wifesays: ``Well, I am wondering how long it is going to take you to rememberour anniversary. It was on Sunday.'' You say: ``But, dear, anniversaries mean you can acknowledge it any timewithi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the year following that date. Why should you beangry?'' That is about where we are on this. October 3, 1987, means October3, 1987. At least the parties should have started reviewing it then. [S16MY8-207]{S5894}HELMSMr. HELMS. Exactly. [S16MY8-208]{S5894}NUNNMr. NUNN. I agree with the Senator, and I think he is absolutely right.The problem is, this may be a little thing to some of the people in theState Department, or it may be a big thing. I am not sure. They think ignoringcertain provisions for convenience sake may be a little thing. I think when you start down that path, whether it is on a violation bythe Soviet Union or whether it be obfuscation by the United States of alegal point, when you start down that path, there is no place to draw aline. So I think the Senator is totally correct, and I urge our colleagues toadopt the amendment as written. The Senator worked with our staff in working out certain language thatwould have related to the INF Treaty. That has been deleted, as I understandit. So we now have it clearly directed to the ABM Treaty and the anniversarydate; is that correct? [S16MY8-209]{S5894}HELMSMr. HELMS. Correct. [S16MY8-210]{S5894}NUNNMr. NUNN. I urge the Senate adopt the amendment of the Senator from NorthCarolina as it has been submitted, which takes out all reference to theINF Treaty. [S16MY8-211]{S5894}HELMSMr. HELMS. WIll the Senator yield for one observation? [S16MY8-212]{S5894}NUNNMr. NUNN. Yes. [S16MY8-213]{S5894}HELMSMr. HELMS. I cannot speak for the lovely Colleen Nunn, but I know thatDot Helms would not permit such interpretation of an anniversary as theState Department has apparently interpreted this one. [S16MY8-214]{S5894}NUNNMr. NUNN. I think Dot and Colleen would understand obfuscation when theyran into it. Occasionally I tried, but I very seldom succeeded. [S16MY8-215]{S5894}HELMSMr. HELMS. I thank the Senator. [S16MY8-216]{S5894}PELLMr. PELL addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.   [S16MY8-217]{S5894}PELLMr. PELL. Mr. President, I oppose<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the Helms amendment as offered but support the amendment.I believe the administration should begin the ABM Treaty review conferencein the near future. If the conference were to occur in late summer or earlyfall, that would seem to be acceptable.In that connection, I would point out that the Director of the Arms Controland Disarmament Agency, General Burns, has told the Foreign Relations Committeethat he anticipates that the review will be held in late summer or earlyfall.I do not believe that the parties were obligated to conduct the ABM Treatyreview conference on October 3, 1987. As General Burns told the Committee,``the United States and the Soviet Union have until October 2, 1988 toaccomplish the ABM Treaty Review.'' General Burns also pointed out, ``TheUnited States has consistently taken the position that 5-year review conferencesmust be initiated, but need not be completed, within the year followingthe date of the 5-year anniversary.''Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the responses of General Burnsto the Foreign Relations Committee be inserted in the <T4>Record.</T4>There being no objection, the response<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s were<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> ordered to be printed in the <T4>Record,<CODE-213>5</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213> as follows:[S16MY8-218]{S5894}5.<ITAG tagnum="21">5.Q. Why has there been no ABM Treaty Review this five year anniversarywhen past practice was to do it close to the anniversary?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. Under the Treaty, the United States and the Soviet Union have untilOctober 2, 1988 to accomplish the ABM Treaty Review. The Treaty Review,however, is but one of a number of fora for discussing ABM Treaty relatedissues. Besides the two sessions each year of the SCC, one of which isgoing on at this time in Geneva, issues related to the ABM Treaty, includingSoviet compliance, are being extensively discussed in the NST negotiationsas well as other diplomatic channels. In view of this related activity,I anticipate the Review will be held in late summer or early fall so asto take advantage of the outcome of these discussions. The forum and theagenda for the Review will be decided on that basis, as well.</ITAG>[S16MY8-219]{S5894}6.<ITAG tagnum="21">6.Q. What is ACDA's view of the Helms ABM Treaty Review Amendmentproposed and subsequently withdrawn from the Intelligence Oversight Bill?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. The United States is in full compliance with the ABM Treaty. Paragraph2 of Article XIV says that ``Five years after the entry into force of thisTreaty, and at five year intervals thereafter, the Parties shall togetherconduct a review of this Treaty.'' This provision is similar, but not identical,to provisions in other arms control treaties that have five-year reviewconferences, including Article VIII of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, ArticleVII of the Seabed Arms Control Treaty (which requires only a single five-yearreview), Article XII of the Biological Weapons Convention (which requiresonly a single five-year review), and Article VIII of the EnvironmentalModification Convention. Since the Parties cannot be expected to conducttheir reviews exactly upon the five-year anniversaries, the question hasrisen in the past as to when a conference must be initiated if the Partiesare to be in compliance with a review conference provision. The UnitedStates has consistently taken the position that five-year review conferencesmust be initiated, but need not be completed, within the year followingthe date of the five-year anniversary. This is because, where the provisionsdo not set a more precise date, the Parties will be in compliance as longas the period does not extend to becoming a six-year period. For example,the second NPT five-year review conference was initiated in August 1980,and the third NPT five-year review conference was initiated in September1985, which were five months and six months, respectively, after the March5 anniversary date.</ITAG>[S16MY8-220]{S5895}new and co<ITAG tagnum="89">new and conclusive evidence of soviet nationwide abm breakout</ITAG>[S16MY8-221]{S5895}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. Mr. President, there is now conclusive, clearcut evidence thatthe Soviet Union has broken out of the ABM Treaty by deploying the prohibitedbase for an illegal nationwide ABM defense.In late 1981, our distinguished colleague Senator <T4>David Boren,</T4> who is now the chairman of the Senate Select Committeeon Intelligence, stated that the Soviets were:[S16MY8-222]{S5895}<ITAG tagnum="21">Tesing . . . air defense radars and missiles in an ABM mode, providingthe breakout potential for a nationwide ABM defense . . . [and] buildingnew large ABM battle-management radars and a rapidly deployable new ABMsystem, adding further to a nationwide ABM breakout potential.</ITAG>Senator <T4>Boren</T4> was absolutely right in 1981 to predict Soviet ABM breakout,and he is absolutely right to be even more worried about Soviet nationwideABM breakout today.President Reagan himself stated on October 13, 1985, that: ``For some yearsnow we have been aware that the Soviets have been developing a nationwidedefense'' in violation of the ABM Treaty. President Reagan was correct.As recently as March 14, 1988, President Reagan stated: ``The Soviets maybe preparing a nationwide ABM defense of their territory. In other words,they may be preparing to break out of the ABM Treaty.'' Again, PresidentReagan was correct.The CIA made the same correct prediction in a declassified national intelligenceestimate on June 26, 1985:[S16MY8-223]{S5895}<ITAG tagnum="21">The Soviets will significantly improve the capabilities of their strategicdefenses [by the early 1990s.] We are particularly concerned that the Soviets'continuing development efforts give them the potential for widespread ABMdeployments. The Soviets have the major components for an ABM system thatcould be used for widespread ABM deployments well in excess of ABM Treatylimits.

But if the ABM Treatyrestrains only American defense and not Soviet, then the ABM Treaty maybe contrary to fundamental United States national security interests.

These leaders are sayingthat we do not have the political will to do what we need to do in ourown defense; they are in effect saying that American appeasement is ouronly alternative for dealing with relentlessly increasing Soviet power.[S16MY8-230]{S5896}significan<ITAG tagnum="89">significance of new assessments of soviet abm radars</ITAG>The Senate should be informed of some new administration assessments pointingto new Soviet nationwide ABM breakout violations of the ABM Treaty. Theseassessments are all unclassified, and they are new_they have just beenreceived from the administration.The new assessments demonstrate clearly that the administration has concludedthat each of the 10 Pechora-Krasnoyarsk-Sevastopol class radars is itselfan ABM battle management radar, and thus each of the 10 radars itself isa separate violation of the ABM Treaty. Moreover, the new assessments meanthat the Soviets have established an illegal base for a prohibited nationwideABM defense. These new assessments in turn provide conclusive evidencethat the Soviets have broken out of the ABM Treaty by deploying the basefor a nationwide ABM defense, as well as the nationwide defense itself.The question of Soviet ABM breakout is not whether, but when. And the whenis_now. According to a carefully researched book, published in 1986 bythe authoritative Mr. Bill Lee, of the Defense Intelligenc<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Agency:[S16MY8-231]{S5896}<ITAG tagnum="21">[The Soviet air, space, and ABM defense organization] PVO also developedthe flat twin transportable missile-engagement radar designed for use inconjunction with the Pechora-class radars and with the SH-8 high accelerationinterceptor. . . . The new Moscow ABM defenses and the second generationof large phased array radars will probably be completed during the period1986-1988. The Soviets would then appear to be in an excellent positionto break out of the ABM Treaty by deploying their ABM-X-3 system. Completionof the Moscow defenses will require that most, or perhaps all, of the majorcomponents already be in series production. . . .

There are many indications that the Soviets will break outbefore the end of the 1980's. . . . The USSR already has high-acceleration,low-altitude interceptor technology, small phased array radar and computertechnology that is comparable to or better than similar U.S. technologyof a decade ago. . . . The Soviets will soon have sufficiently large ABMbattle-management radars in operation to make nationwide deployments areality<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> . . . Recent intelligence assessments of ABM capabilitiesfor the SA-10 and the SA-X-12 also could mean that nationwide deploymentof at least limited ABM defenses may be underway . . . [everything indicatesthat the Soviets] are following a breakout scenario.</ITAG>Moreover, according to press reports, the CIA has stated:[S16MY8-232]{S5896}<ITAG tagnum="21">The Soviets have developed all the required components for an ABMsystem that would be deployed not only to augment the defenses around Moscow,but also for widespread deployments beyond Moscow in excess of ABM Treatylimits. These components include the Flat Twin engagement radar, the PawnShop guidance radar, and an aboveground launcher for the Gazelle SH-08interceptor. As compared with a silo-based version, a site for the mobileSH-08 could be deployed relatively rapidly, in months rather than years.These components have not been tested together since 1984, but the 1984full system test of the Gazelle with the Flat Twin represents the culminationof the final phase of testing, and the Soviets are still emphasizing adeployment option for the Gazelle and Flat Twin. Nationwide breakout technicallycould begin at any time if the Soviets had made the decision and startedpreparations 1 year or 2 ago. The major components of a rapidly deployableABM system continue to be operated at the test facility at Sary Shaganand major successful testing integrating Gazelle and its Flat Twin radarwas conducted in 1984. The full-system has completed testing, includingfull system testing against live targets, and this indicates that the systemis available for deployment. The Soviets would almost certainly take stepsto deploy their own ABM system in the 1990s if the U.S. was proceedingwith SDI, using SH-08/Flat Twin or new and modified components.</ITAG>The ABM-capable SAM-12B system is reportedly about to be deployed. TheSoviets reportedly now have several ABM breakout options for deploymentof mobile SH-04 and SH-08 interceptors that can be taken ``off the shelf,''which means these interceptors may already have been produced. SH-08'smay have already been covertly deployed. According to recent press reports,the floor space of the plant manufacturing the SH-08 has doubled in size,despite the completion of the required interceptors for the legal MoscowABM <ITAG tagnum="80">system. This doubling of floor space suggests series production oflarge numbers of SH-08 interceptors for nationwide deployment_reportedly<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>3,000. </ITAG>There are already 2,500 SAM-5 ABM-capable interceptors deployed nationwide,together with 2,000 SAM-10 ABM-capable interceptors. There are about 7,000small ABM-capable engagement radars associated with these two systems.There are 31 Soviet large ABM radars. Given the near completion of thelong-leadtime LPAR network, lack of evidence of SH-08 ABM interceptor deploymentto go with the network could itself be evidence of covert interceptor deployment.The SH-04, SH-08, SH-11, SAM-5, SAM-10, and SAM-12B interceptors are reportedlyall believed to be equipped with the low yield nuclear warheads requiredfor ABM usage. There are also press reports that ABM point defenses are being constructedat deep underground command and control bunkers and other widely scatteredstrategic sites around the U.S.S.R. Indeed, we should be deeply worried that because the long-leadtime componentof a nationwide ABM defense_the LPAR network_is almost completed, otheralready produced but covertly deployed ABM interceptors that go with theseLPAR's probably already exist, but they are not detected. Given also thehigh degree of Soviet efforts at data denial, indeed, we should assumethat other undetected interceptors are already produced and are deployedcovertly nationwide. But as shall be seen, there is also much other additional new unclassifiedevidence of a Soviet nationwide ABM defense breakout. There are now twoSoviet ``material breach'' violations of the ABM Treaty confirmed by conclusiveintelligence evidence, Soviet admission, and by the President and the Congress.Both of these confirmed Soviet ``material breaches'' of the ABM Treatyhelp provide an illega<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> base for a Soviet nationwide ABM defense, whichis prohibited by the ABM Treaty. Together, these two violations themselvesconstitute Soviet nationwide ABM breakout, especially when combined withmany other bodies of evidence of Soviet ABM breakout with covert interceptormissile deployments. In sum, the Soviets have not been prevented by the ABM Treaty from constructingthe illegal base for an illegal nationwide ABM defense. They are constructinga nationwide ABM defense itself, in full-scale breakout. Beyond many other bodies of evidence of Soviet nationwide ABM breakout,we will review first all the unclassified evidence of Soviet nationwideABM breakout.

In fact, theentire 10 LPAR network clearly constitutes a prohibited integrated basefor an illegal nationwide ABM defense.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Second, the Krasnoyarsk radar's siting is ideal forenabling it to provide accurate RV impact predictions for nearly ICBM fields.This siting is thus ideal for battle management.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Third, given this ideal siting for ABM battle managementfor the Krasnoyarsk radar, this siting is therefore further evidence thatthe Krasnoyarsk radar is an ABM battle management radar. The nine otherLPAR's are all very similar to Krasnoyarsk, and Krasnoyarsk is a battlemanagement radar.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Fourth, the similarity of each of the other 9 LPAR'sto the Krasnoyarsk ABM battle management radar means that in fact all 10LPAR's are ABM battle management radars.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Fifth, in addition to the entire LPAR network beingviolation of the ABM Treaty by being the prohibited base for a nationwideABM defense, each individual LPAR is a violation because it is internettedwith the others and therefore is an ABM battle management radar.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Sixth, U.S. intelligence should therefore expectto detect other ABM interceptors near Krasnoyarsk, which would be positionedto receive hand-off data from Krasnoyarsk for their engagement radars.We should also expect to detect interceptors near all the others, and nationwide.Indeed, there are already many ABM-capable SAM-5's and SAM-10's deployednear Krasnoyarsk. And Krasnoyarsk is located optimally for defense of another30 percent of the Soviet ICBM <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>forces. Thus the Moscow and Krasnoyarsk ABM <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>systems themselves can probably defend over 60 percentof the Soviet ICBM force.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Seventh, given the evidence that the network of 10LPAR's is a base for a nationwide ABM defense, and given the further evidencethat each of the 10 LPAR's is an ABM battle management radar, it wouldbe prudent for U.S. intelligence to predict covert deployment of other<ITAG tagnum="80">ABM interceptors nationwide. The evidence of an LPAR network basefor nationwide ABM defense, the long-leadtime component, together with10 individual ABM battle management radars, indicates clearly that theSoviets are breaking out of the ABM Treaty. Indeed, there are already about4,500 ABM-capable SAM-5's and SAM-10's deployed nationwide. Moreover, thousandsof ABM-capable SAM-12B's are reportedly now being mass produced, and over3,000 SH-08 ABM intercept<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>or<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s are reportedly planned and already in series productionat a plant that has recently doubled in size.</ITAG>[S16MY8-242]{S5897}CorrectCa<ITAG tagnum="89">Correct Categorization of Sary Shagan LPAR_Either Confirmation ofNationwide ABM Defense Break Out Or Another Krasnoyarsk Smoking Gun</ITAG>The correct categorization of the Pechora-Krasnoyarsk-Sevastopol classLPAR at Sary Shagan is the final key piece of evidence of the Soviet breakout in<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> a nationwide defense.The President has reported that the Krasnoyarsk LPAR was identical to theSary Shagan LPAR, but the President added incorrectly that the Sary ShaganLPAR was exempted from the requirements of article VI constraining earlywarning radar location because it was located at a test range. ArticleVI states that each party undertakes ``not to deploy in the future radarsfor early warning of strategic ballistic missile attack except at locationsalong the periphery of its national territory and oriented outward.''But article IV is the provision on test ran<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e exemptions, and article IV states:[S16MY8-243]{S5897}<ITAG tagnum="21">The limitations provided for in article III [i.e. on allowed ABM deployments]shall not apply to ABM systems or their components used for developmentor testing, and located within current or additionally agreed test ranges. . .</ITAG>This means that test ranges are exempted from constraints only on ABM radardeployments, but test ranges are clearly not exempted from the restrictionson early warning radars embodied in article VI. Therefore, if an LPAR isat a test range, it can legally be only one thing_it can only be an ABMbattle management radar. If it is an ABM battle management radar, it isexempted by article IV's test range exemption, but only from the restrictionson ABM deployments in article III.As noted, the President reported to Congress on January 23, 1984, thatthe Sary Shagan LPAR was an early warning radar. The President incorrectlyreported further that an early warning radar could be located at a testrange, thus exempting it from the requirements of article VI on early warningradars. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>B<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ut the only exemption for radars at test ranges,however, pertain to article III limitations.In sum, the LPAR at Sary Shagan is either an ABM battle management radar,in which case it is legal if located at Sary Shagan under the article IVtest range exemption, or it is an early warning radar. Five of the otherLPAR's are identical to the Sary Shagan LPAR, so if it is an ABM battlemanagement radar, so are all five of the others. If, on the other hand,it is an early warning radar, it can not be located at a test range, andfurther, it must be on the periphery and oriented outward. But the SaryShagan LPAR is several<ITAG tagnum="80">hundred kilometers into the interior of the U.S.S.R., and further,it is oriented obliquely across the further interior of the U.S.S.R. inthe direction of the Indian Ocean.</ITAG>Thus there are only two choices on how to categorize the Sary Shagan LPARcorrectly_either it is itself a legally located ABM battle management radarat a test range, but it is identical to 5 of the other 10 LPAR's, eachof which also must be considered to be ABM battle management radars, andthey therefore constitute an i<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ll<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>egal base for an illegal nationwide ABM defense.And since the Sary Shagan ABM radar is an integral part of the prohibitedbase for the illegal nationwide ABM defense, it too would be illegal. Oralternatively, the Sary Shagan LPAR is an early warning radar, and as suchit must be on the periphery and oriented outward, according to articleVI. But it is not, so it must be regarded as another Krasnoyarsk, clearoutviolation.In either case, the Sary Shagan LPAR's correct categorization increasesthe evidence that the Soviet's are breaking out of the ABM Treaty.The strongest evidence supports the conclusion that the Sary Shagan LPARis an ABM battle management radar, and that it and the other five LPAR'sidentical to it form the illegal base for a prohibited nationwide AMB defense.[S16MY8-244]{S5898}other evid<ITAG tagnum="89">other evidence of soviet nationwide ABM Defense Breakout</ITAG>It is important to emphasize a very important judgment made in PresidentReagan's December 1, 1987, seventh report to Congress on Soviet SALT violations:[S16MY8-245]{S5898}<ITAG tagnum="21">``In no case where we determined that the Soviet Union was in violationof SALT I and SALT II did the Soviets take corrective action.''</ITAG>This means that the Soviets have not corrected any of their ABM Treatyviolations. Indeed, there is an expanding pattern of Soviet ABM Treatyviolations.The Soviet Krasnoyarsk radar is a clear violation of the ABM Treaty, whichthe President has reported is ``based on conclusive evidence.'' Moreover,in diplomatic channels, the Soviets have conceded that the Pechora radaris an early warning radar, and this radar is identical to the Krasnoyarskradar. The Soviet claim that Krasnoyarsk is a space-tracking radar is contradictedby these facts.Thus the Soviets have in effect admitted in diplomatic channels that Krasnoyarskis a violation.The CIA has also recently provided the following declassified additionaljudgment:[S16MY8-246]{S5898}<ITAG tagnum="21">The United States is aware that, over the last several years, Sovietofficials have indicated that the Krasnoyarsk radar is a violation of theABM Treaty. </ITAG>This means that the Soviets have admitted privately to themselves thatKrasnoyarsk is a violation. Soviet scientists are also privately admittingthat Krasnoyarsk is a violation, according to open testimony from expertwitnesses before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. There are pressreports of Soviet admissions that Soviet Defense Minister Dimitri Ustinovdeli<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>b<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>erately planned the Krasnoyarsk radar violation in1972, precisely when the SALT I ABM Treaty was signed, and when Ustinovwas Party Secretary and Politburo member in charge of the defense industries.This further evidence confirms that the Soviet leaders k<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ne<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>w from the early 1970's, when they first plannedits construction, that Krasnoyarsk was a cle<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ar<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> violation. Thus there is now clear-cut evidencethat the Soviet leadership signed the ABM Treaty full intending at theoutset to violate it_the Soviets have publicly admitted this themselves.During 1987, both the Senate and the House of Representatives voted overwhelminglyin agreement with the President that the Krasnoyarsk radar was a clearviolation of the ABM Treaty. On May 7, 1987, the House voted unanimously,418 to 0. The Senate voted overwhelmingly, 93 to 5, in September 1987,and <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>on<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> February 23, 1987, the Senate also voted 93 to 2that the Krasnoyarsk radar was an <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mportant obstacl<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> to the advice and consent of two thirds of the Senateto the ratification of the proposed INF Treaty. Krasnoyarsk thus constitutesa <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>m<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>aterial breac<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of the ABM Treaty. Moreover, in his December report President Reagan referred for the firsttime to ``the new violation in the deployment of the Flat Twin and PawnShop observed at Gomel.'' The President added that: [S16MY8-247]{S5898}<ITAG tagnum="21">The U.S. Government finds that the USSR's activities with respectto moving a Flat Twin ABM radar and a Pawn Shop van, a component of anABM system, from a test range and initiating deployment at a location [i.e.Gomel] outside of an ABM deployment area or ABM test range constitutesa violation of the ABM Treaty . . . This and other ABM-related Soviet activitiessuggest that the USSR may be preparing an ABM defense of its national territory.</ITAG>The Soviets have admitted in diplomatic channels that precisely the verysame Flat Twin/Pawn Shop radars now de<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>pl<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>oyed at Gomel are ABM radars. They have admittedfurther that if such ABM radars were ever located outside a test rangeor the allowed Moscow deployment area, this deployment would contitutea prohibited base for a prohibited nationwide ABM defense, thereby violatingthe most important provision of the ABM Treaty, article I. But more recently,the Soviets have even lied to the United States about their Gomel ABM violations,now claiming falsely that this activity is not a violation. Moreover, theSoviets have recently falsely claimed that the Flat Twin/Pawn Shop ABMradars were sent to Gomel to be dismantled, when the United States knowsthat this was not accurate. Gomel thus also constitutes a <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>m<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>aterial breach<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.There is other strong evidence that the Soviets are deploying a nationwideABM defense, which violates the ABM Treaty's ban on developing even a basefor a nationwide ABM defense.President Reagan also stated that over 100 ABM-mode tests of Soviet SAM-5,SAM-10, and SAM-12 surface-to-air missiles and radars are ``highly probable''violations of the ABM Treaty. In fact, he added that: ``In recent years,we have gathered an increased amount of evidence'' on Soviet ABM-mode testsof SAM systems.Indeed, two top Soviet officials have actually admitted that the SovietSAM-5/10/12 were originally designed to have ABM capabilities.The Soviets have already deployed over 2,500 SAM-5 ABM-capable engagementradars nationwide, and over 2,500 SAM-5 ABM-capable interceptors, 2,000to 4,000 SAM-10 ABM-capable interceptors, and about 1,000 SAM-12A interceptors,plus reportedly about 500 SH-08 mobile ABM interceptors_with 3,000 planned,and already in series production.The President has reported further that the mobility of the Soviet ABM-3system is a violation of the ABM Treaty's prohibition on mobile ABM's.The Soviets reportedly are now mass producing the mobile ABM-3 system_SH-04and SH-08 interceptors and Flat Twin radars_for rapid nationwide deployment.The Soviet rapid reload capability for ABM launchers is a serious causefor concern. The State and Defense Departments state that the Soviets ``may''have a prohibited rapidly reload<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>able ABM system.President Reagan said in December:[S16MY8-248]{S5898}<ITAG tagnum="21">The U.S. Government reaffirms the judgment of the March 1987 Reportthat the aggregate of the Soviet Union's ABM and ABM-related actions (e.g.,LPAR radar construction, concurrent SAM-ABM mode testing, SAM upgrade,ABM rapid reload, ABM mobility, and deployment of ABM components to Gomel)suggests that the USSR may be preparing an ABM defense of its nationalterritory. Our concern continues . . . The redundancy in coverage providedby these new radars [the 10 Pechora-<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Krasnoyarsk-Sevastopol Class radars] and the dispositionof these <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>radars closely resembles the design of the U.S. SafeguardABM program.</ITAG>The U.S. Safeguard Program was designed to be a 12-site, nationwide ABMsystem.Reportedly, radar internetting, calibration, and ``hand-off''<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>exercises have already been detected between someof the LPAR's, the Moscow Pill Box, and the smaller ABM-capable engagementradars.

Further, as the administration stated in October<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>1985:  [S16MY8-251]{S5899}<ITAG tagnum="21">The aggregate of current Soviet ABM and ABM/related activities suggestedthat the USSR may be preparing an ABM defense of its national territory_preciselywhat the ABM Treaty was designed to prevent.  </ITAG>As the Secretary of Defense has warned:  [S16MY8-252]{S5899}<ITAG tagnum="21">The deployment of such a large nu<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>mb<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>er of radars, and the pattern of their deployment,together with other Soviet ABM-related activities, suggest that the SovietUnion may be preparing a nationwide ABM defense in violation of the ABMTreaty. Such a development would have the gravest implications on the UnitedStates-Soviet strategic balance. Nothing could be more dangerous to thesecurity of the West and global stability than a unilateral Soviet deploymentof a nationwide ABM system combined with <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>it<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s massive offensive missile capabilities.  </ITAG>There is also unclassified evidence that the SH-11 ex<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>atmospheric ABM interceptor, reportedly now operationalin 16 silos around Moscow, uses an infrared optical target acquisition,tracking<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and homing system. At the time that the ABM Treatywas signed in 1972, however, only ABM radars and inertial guidance wereused for target acquisition, tracking, and guidance, Therefore, the SH-11'sinfrared system used for target aquisition, tracking, and guidance is asubstitute for ABM components in existence in 1972_radar<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and inertial quidance. The SH-11 is therefore basedon ``other physical principles,'' not in use with ABM systems in 1972.Thus the SH-11's deployment violates even the ``broad'' interpretationof the ABM Treaty.  On February 7, 1988, the Soviet publication Moscow News openly admitt<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d that their SH-11 used an infrared tracking andhoming system, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>while <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>trying to deny that this was a violation of the ABMTreaty. But this Soviet admission confirms that the SH-11 is a violation.   The CIA reportedly suppressed this evidence for several years, and didnot report this evidence until just before the December 7, 1987 Pearl Harborsum<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>m<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>it. The CIA's report only came after the administrationhad already lost the congressional debate over the narrow, restrictiveinterpretation of the ABM Treaty, versus the legally correct interpretation.[S16MY8-253]{S5899}abm treaty<ITAG tagnum="89">abm treaty negotiating record indicates soviet intention to deploynationwide defense</ITAG>Finally, several other important new facts emerge from an unclassifiedreview of the ABM Treaty negotiating record provided in the Ph<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.D.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> dissertation of a leading defense exp<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>er<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t. The Soviet ABM network allowed under the termsof the ABM Treaty indicates a deliberate Soviet plan to use this networkas a base for a nationwide ABM defense in direct contravention of articleI of the ABM Treaty. The Soviets have gained a huge advantage over theUnited States by constructing a large and extensive network of long-leadtime radars.First, during the 1969-72 negotiations on the ABM Treaty, the United Statesargued that Soviet construction of a large network of LPAR's would be thecrucial part of a Soviet nationwide ABM defense. The United States negotiatedunsuccessfully to try to ban this possibility. But Soviet deployment ofthe base for a nationwide ABM defense is exactly what has been deployed.With this LPAR network now in place, the Soviets could clandestinely assembleshort-lead time and transportation items such as interceptors, launchers,and smaller engagement radars necessary to complete a nationwide network.The allowable Soviet LPAR's agreed to under the terms of the ABM Treatyare far more numerous than the low number in the original American position.``Agreed Statement F'' ostensibly on radar limits does not apply to theLPAR's that the United States was most interested in controlling in SALTfrom the outset of the SALT negotiations.When the Krasnoyarsk radar violation is seen in the context of the originalconcerns and intentions of U.S. SALT negotiators in limiting LPAR's, theKrasnoyarsk radar is extremely significant militarily, and it reveals Sovietpreparations that could support a nationwide ABM defense.It is undeniable <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>th<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>at the location, power level, size, type, orientation,and sign<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>al<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> characteristics of Soviet LPAR's give them the capabilityto identify, track, discriminate, and predict the impact points of reentryvehicles.In sum, the Soviets have not been forbidden by the ABM Treaty from constructingwhat must be considered the base for a nationwide ABM defense. The UnitedStates negotiating position on LPAR's shifted from a complete prohibition,to the acceptance of existing Soviet LPAR's such as hen house radars butwith a ban on future complexes, and finally to no restrictions on LPARdeployment except for location and orientation. And even that constraintwas subsequently ignored<ITAG tagnum="80">with the Krasnoyarsk radar. Agreed Interpretation F together witharticles II, III, and VI, supposedly regulated LP<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>AR's<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, but in actuality these provisions allowed an expansionrather than a constraint on the peripheral Soviet network of LPAR<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. The Soviets chose to exploit a right to deploy,without numerical limits, LPAR's on the periphery of their territory, evenwhen those LPAR deployments defeated the key purpose of the ABM Treaty.</ITAG>The decision by Soviet leaders to build Pechora class radars on the peripheryof the Soviet Union occurred in the mid-1960's, and the decision to buildthe Krasnoyarsk LPAR away from the periphery occurred in the early 1970's.The process of building these radars began before SALT began, and continuedduring and after negotiations on the ABM Treaty. It was widely acknowledgedby experts that without restrictions on LPAR's, the integrity of the ABMTreaty would be in doubt.[S16MY8-254]{S5899}u.s. fear <ITAG tagnum="89">u.s. fear of confronting the soviets over their abm treaty violations?</ITAG>Article X<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>IV<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>(2) of the SALT I ABM Treaty, states:[S16MY8-255]{S5899}<ITAG tagnum="21">Five years after entry into force of this Treaty, and at five-yearintervals thereafter, the Parties shall together conduct a review of thisTreaty.</ITAG>The ABM Treaty entered into force on October 3, 1972, and thus the third5-year review was required to be conducted by the SALT I Standing ConsultativeCommission [SCC] beginning on October 3, 1987.The previous two <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>5-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>year reviews, in 1977 and 1982, both started onlya month after the 5-year anniversary date of entry into force of the ABMTreaty.In 1977, the first 5-year review began on November 4, 1977, and resultedin a public communique on November 21, 1977. In 1982, the second 5-yearreview began on November 9, 1982, and resulted in a public communique onDecember 15, 1982.The U.S. State Department, however, has decided to delay indefinitely thisthird 5-year SCC review. The delay would appear to violate the treaty.There is no good reason for the United States to delay the third 5-yearreview.But this third required SCC review of the treaty would be the first 5-yearreview to occur since President Reagan initially reported the Soviet Krasnoyarskradar ABM Treaty violation and other Soviet SALT violations to Congresson January 23, 1984. There have now been seven Presidential reports toCongress on Soviet SALT violations, and the Krasnoyarsk radar has gonefrom an ``almost certain'' violation to be ``confirmed and conclusive violation.''Moreover, the entire Congress has voted overwhelmingly several times toconfirm the President's judgment that the Krasnoyarsk radar is a clearcutviolation of the ABM Treaty.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><G7./>1S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>0634<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>A violation that is serious, ``defeats the objectand purpose'' of the treaty, and is militarily significant and dangerousenough to allow one side to abrogate the treaty, must be regarded a ``materialbreach.''

These new Soviet <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>AB<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>M violations include the Gomel Flat Twin/Pawn Shopradars, and they are as conclusive and as clearc<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ut <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>a violation as Krasnoyarsk. The other new developmentis that the SH-11 is an ABM interceptor using ``Other Physical Principles,''and therefore it violates the ABM Treaty. As noted, the Soviets have evenadmitted that the SH-11 ABM interceptor uses ``OPP,'' and that it is deployed.The third new ABM Treaty violation is several more bodies of evidence thatthe Soviets have probably finally begun their long expected nationwideABM breakout deployment.  <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The Soviet Flat Twin/Pawn Shop ABM radars at Gomelare also clear violations.

There are three American options regarding the troublesome Krasnoyarskand Gomel radars. The United States must confront the Soviets with theconclusive Krasnoyarsk and Gomel radar violations, and the United Statesmust declare the Krasnoyarsk and Gomel radars to be ``material breaches''of the ABM Treaty. But the United States can only give notice to abrogatethe ABM Treaty, decide to take a ``proportionate response'' to the Soviet<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Krasnoyarsk-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Gomel violations, or do nothing, thereby condoningthe Soviet violations. None of these three options are attractive to theadministration, and each has certain perceived disadvantages for the UnitedStates. Thus the United States is doing nothing about the illegal SovietKrasnoyarsk-Gomel radars. But the United States will eventually have to confront the Soviets on theseABM Treaty violation issues directly and in public, even though this couldseverely complicate the ongoing INF Treaty ratification process and theSTART negotiations. The unprecedented State <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Department <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>decision to delay indefinitely the third <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>5-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>year review of the ABM Treaty thus suggests thatthe <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>detentists <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>of the State Department are reluctant to confrontthe Soviets on Krasnoyarsk, Gomel, and all the other new Soviet ABM violations.But the treaty is still the law of the land. The review is required bythe terms of the treaty itself, and the review is required to begin onthe 15th anniversary of the treaty's entry into force. Further, the resultsof the review must be reported to Congress and made public. Therefore, this U.S.-initiated failure to review the ABM Treaty may beregarded as a U.S.-initiated violation of the ABM Treaty. The State Department is thus facing the dilemma of being required to confirmnew Soviet ABM Treaty violations as clearcut as Krasnoyarsk and Gomel anddiscuss them publicly with the Soviets, just after the President has signedthe INF Treaty at the December 7, 1987, Pearl Harbor summit. Moreover,the State Department is reluctant to do anything to disrupt the ongoingSTART negotiations. The State Department would appar<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>en<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tly rather appease the Soviet Union than defend Americannational security. Clearly, this is why the State Department believes that, as one diplomatstated privately, ``this is not the time to discuss ABM compliance withthe Soviets.'' But while this delay of the required review may complicatethe ongoing INF ratification process and the negotiations for a START Treaty,it is imperative that the law be respected and obeyed_and that every precautionbe taken to protect <ITAG tagnum="80">the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>American <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>people and their liberties.</ITAG>Why should the United States itself initiate a violation of the ABM Treaty,in order to cover-up and appease 10 Presidentially confirmed Soviet violationsand five brand new Soviet breakout violations of this <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>treaty?<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Three things need to be done. First, the third required ABM Treaty reviewwith the Soviets is already over 7 months late. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>This <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>required review must be initiated immediately. Second,the Soviets should be required to dismantle their Krasnoyarsk radar violationbefore the United States will ratify the proposed INF Treaty. Third, thePresident should report to the Congress the results of the third 5 yearreview before his late-May 1988 <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Moscow <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>summit. If the President were to participate in asecond summit without conducting the required third 5 year review, it wouldagain appear that he was condoning and appeasing Soviet ABM Treaty violations.It would also appear that the State Department, by promoting further <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>summit <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>meetings to sign a START Treaty, is defying the expressedwill of the Senate, which voted overwhelmingly that the Krasnoyarsk radaris ``an important obstacle'' to Senate advice and consent to any new armscontrol treaty such as the proposed INF Treaty.Presidential warnings that the expanding patten of Soviet violations ofall existing arms control treaties is dangerous to American national securitymust be heeded. President Reagan did discuss the Soviet SALT violationswith Mr. Gorbachev at both of his previous summits. And on March 10, 1987,President Reagan reported to Congress that Soviet correction of all theirexisting SALT violations was an ``essential prerequisite'' for him to signany new arms control treaty.But the pattern of Soviet violations continued to expand, according toPresident Reagan's report to Congress on Soviet SALT violations of December1, 1987. None of the Soviet violations were corrected, according to thePresident. The President thus seemed to condone the expanding patten ofSoviet SALT violations when he signed the INF Treaty. The President's INFTreaty signing in the context of an expanding pattern of ever more seriousSoviet SALT violations could be interpreted as an act of appeasement.Some Senators wonder if it therefore was unwise for the President to signan INF Treaty and ask the Senate to give its advice and consent to itsratification before each of the confirmed and new Soviet violations ofarms control <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>treaties <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>are fully reversed and corrected. In signing anynew arms control treaty with the Soviets before full compliance with existingarms treaties is restored, the President of the United States could appearto condone, forget about, and appease past violations.

Sucha Senate vote could likewise appear to be <ITAG tagnum="80">appeasement.</ITAG>The Chief of the Soviet General Staff Main Operations Directorate reportedlytold a high ranking American official visiting Moscow recently that theSoviet Union intended to continue to ignore United States concerns andfeeble protests over the ever expanding pattern of Soviet SALT violations.The general's statement can be seen as another example of Soviet nuclearblackmail.For this reason, the Senate voted on February 17, 1987 overwhelmingly_93to 2_that ``the Soviet violations of exiting'' treaties was ``an importantobstacle to the achievement of acceptable'' new arms treaties with theSoviets. The required October 3, 1987 ABM Treaty review already 7 monthslate may be the last opportunity for the Soviets to come into compliancewith existing arms control treaties.

President Reagan added that the Soviet Unionnow has a ``first strike capability'' which was ``seriously eroding thestability of the balance,'' and which has resulted in a ``loss in the survivabilityof United States strategic forces.''<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Fourth, I would point out that article XV of theSALT I ABM Treaty, which was ratified on October 3, 1972, states:[S16MY8-260]{S5901}<ITAG tagnum="21">Each Party shall, in exercising its national sovereignty, have theright to withdraw from this Treaty if it decides that extraordinary eventsrelated to the subject matter of the Treaty have jeopardized its supremeinterests.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Fifth, President Reagan reported further to Congressthat the siting, orientation, and capabilities of the Soviet KrasnoyarskABM battle management radar ``directly violates'' three p<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ro<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>visions of the SALT I ABM Treaty. Both the Senateand the House of Representatives have now each voted unanimously that theKrasnoyarsk radar is a violation of the SALT I ABM Treaty.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Sixth, President Reagan has also reported furtherto Congress that<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <ITAG tagnum="80">it is highly probable that the Soviet Union has conducted multipletests of surface-to-air missile interceptors and radars in a prohibitedABM mode, and has developed a prohibited mobile ABM system. The Presidenthas also reported to Congress that ``all Soviet large phased array radars_havethe inherent capability_of contributing to ABM battle management, and LPAR'shave always been considered the long lead time elements of a possible territorialdefense.'' President Reagan himself added that the Soviet Union ``may bedeveloping a nationwide ABM defense'' in direct contravention of articleI of the ABM Treaty, the most important provision of the treaty.</ITAG>The failure to achieve permanent constraints on offensive weapons and theSoviet strategic offensive and defensive buildups have placed the supremeinterests of the United States in jeopardy. The President is required toreport to the Senate on an urgent basis whether the United States shouldwithdraw from the SALT I ABM Treaty.The Helms amendment, as incorporated into the Pell amendment, merely providesthat the President of the United States should make such a report. Therequired report is long overdue.There was also another Helms' amendment recently introduced and withdrawncondemning the United States violation of the ABM Treaty, by failing toconduct the third 5-year review. Continued failure by the State Departmentto conduct the required third 5-year review of the ABM Treaty may makeit necessary to offer this amendment again.[S16MY8-261]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5901}<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>the inf tr<ITAG tagnum="89">the inf treaty requires conventional parity to preserve deterrence</ITAG>The United States and NATO must maintain a strong nuclear deterrent, inorder to preserve deterrence against Soviet-Warsaw Pact conventional forceadvantages.

The Pershing II isthe only system that will meet the NATO deterrent guidelines, by beingable to strike key targets quickly and accurately deep inside the SovietUnion. What is the effect on the credibility of deterrence of the requiredremoval under the INF Treaty of the Pershing II's if no remaining systemscan replace their capability? By eliminating the Pershing II, the INF Treatyalso cripples the NATO ability to deter Soviet CBW capabilities.

F-111 fighter-bombers about 200; Total, about 4,000.  </ITAG>But none of the above systems have the range, swiftness, accuracy, andmegatonnage of the key NATO nuclear deterrent system, the Pershing II.Only the F-111 could possibly substitute for the Pershing II to strikekey command, control, and leadership targets deep inside the Soviet Union,but it has a radius of only 300 miles unrefueled, and 1,000 miles refueled.Moreover, Soviet-Warsaw Pact air defense capability has increased greatlysince the NATO ``dual <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>track<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>'' decision of 1979, when the decision was made tosupplement the F-111's with the Pershing II's. Under the INF Treaty, whatdoes NATO have that can go past the 300-miles range, unless we can refuelF-111's in conflict, and it can penetrate?  Are these 4,000 NATO warheads left, most of which have either no range,or very short range, a credible deterrent to the Soviets? Was the Montebelloreduction of about 2,400 warheads reciprocated by the Soviets? Did it representunilateral reduction, and already contribute to denuclearization of NATO? It is clear that the Pershing II is the only system that will meet theNATO deterrent guidelines, by being able to strike key targets quicklyand accurately deep inside the Soviet Union. What is the effect on thecredibility of deterence of the removal of the Pershing II's, when no remainingsystem can replace their capability?  There are grave dangers in relying on 400 SLBM's dedicated to SACEUR forNATO deterrence of the Warsaw Pact. The use of strategic intercontinentalweapons for theater deterrence purposes is extremely dangerous for theUnited States, and not credible to the Soviets. Such reliance also dangerouslyincreases the already severe United States strategic intercontinental inferiorityto the Soviets.

If the Pershing II is the main NATO deterrent weapon, the INF Treaty byremoving this weapon takes away the very basis of deterrence. The INF Treatyputs NATO on a slippery slope leading toward the denuclearization of WesternEurope, which has been a fundamental objective of Soviet foreign policysince 1945. The denuclearization of Western Europe would make the regionsafe for Soviet conventional aggression, and result in the neutralizationof Western Europe due to the threat of Warsaw Pact conventional might.Under the INF Treaty, NATO sacrifices the credibility of its deterrent. The only way that the INF Treaty can be made acceptable and deterrencemaintained is for it to be accompanied by negotiations requiring NATO-WarsawPact conventional force parity.

Mr. President, I wanted the clerk to read a portion of the amendmentto indicate the strong feeling of the Senate in adopting this amendmentbecause dismay and alarm over deplorable and deteriorating conditions inEthiopia have been expressed repeatedly by Senators on both sides of theaisle. But these words thus far have produced no result.Let me give you some examples of what is going on.In the past 2 or 3 weeks, the Ethiopian Government warplanes were bombingdeliberately a food relief station in northern Ethiopia. According to thereport by the Associated Press, warplanes struck the camp about 30 minutesafter monthly food allotments had been distributed to 5,000 to 8,000 peopein rebel-held territory.One of the eye witnesses of the bombing attack said the attack on the civilianswas intentional. He said: ``They flew over and looked at them and cameback and hit them.''The bombs killed about 50 people, according to the AP report, and mostof them were children who were playing in a kindergarten.This amendment, Mr. President, would make absolutely clear where the UnitedStates stands by condemning the brutal regime of Colonel Mengistu and bysupporting the imposition of sanctions on that regime.This proposal would be a strong message from Congress not only to the EthiopianGovernment, but to our own administration. For far too long, the 40 millionpeople of Ethiopia have taken a back seat to other priorities of foreignpolicy. There have only been a handful of people within the administrationwho have really fought to get policy attention focused on Ethiopia.We continue to react and react and talk and talk and talk and write letters,but to no avail; the children are still being killed, countless thousandsof people are starving to death because of this brutal regime. I thinkit is time that we tighten the screws. That is exactly the purpose of thisamendment.Just a few weeks ago, as a matter of fact, we finally heard the Presidentof the United States place Ethiopia in the same list of priorities as armscontrol and peace in Nicaragua. In a major foreign policy speech beforethe World Affairs Council, President Reagan demanded that the Soviets dealstrongly with their puppet regime in Ethiopia. Here is what Ronald Reagansaid: ``They''_meaning the Soviets_``can stop this disaster before it happens.''I will say to the President, so can we in the United States.There is a brutal dictator in Ethiopia who has chosen to obliterate hisopposition by starving them to death. He takes no prisoners. His latesttactic is to kill countless thousands of innocent men and women and childrenand do it within a matter of weeks.I feel strongly about this, and I think other Senators do as well.When he took power through a barrel of a gun over a decade ago, Mengistutook the most basic of freedoms from his people. Right to free speech,right of free press, right to associate * * * you name the freedom andit does not exist in Ethiopia. And now, he is deliberately threateningthe lives of 2-3 million people * * * by taking away food.Ethiopia is a country whose people have suffered enough at the hands ofan illegitimate brutal dictator. The plight of these people today and tomorrowhas to take center court. We must p<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rsevere in keeping the spotlight on that countryuntil its peoples are free from the murderous hands of the Dictator Mengistu.Some have asked for pressure from the United Nations. But frankly, thatoption is bearing_who can be surprised_no fruit. The most that the UnitedNations has been able to accomplish is to allow a handful of UN personnelback into the area.

Our food is there, yet the Communist government refuses to permitthe food to be given to the hungry.The amendment I am offering is identical to a provision reported, unanimouslyby voice vote from the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on May 3.First, it outlines some of the more criminal actions that the EthiopianGovernment has undertaken, especially in recent weeks.We could fill volumes detailing the inhumane activities that the Mengistugovernment has undertaken * * * Such as its villagization scheme whichhas already displaced over 5 million people * * * or its holding of manythousands of political prisoners, or its use of torture, or forced conscriptioninto the army of 12 or 13 year old boys.The amendment speaks to the current emergency situation which resultedwhen the Ethiopian Government forcibly expelled all foreign relief workersfrom the north putting at immediate risk of starvation some 2 to 3 millionpeople.In the amendment, Congress condemns the Government of Ethiopia for theseactions and urges the government to reverse that decision. We want thegovernment to allow our relief workers back into the area even at theirown risk.We also urge the President to keep this issue at the highest level of priorityin his discussion with the Russians, because it is Gorbachev's advis<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rs who sit in Addis Ababa and direct Mengistu.In the amendment, Congress urges also the President to impose sanctionsif the Government of Ethiopia undertakes any of the following actions:First, forced resettlement;Second, forced confinement of anyone already moved to a resettlement camp;Third, diversion of food relief to the military;Fourth, denial of food relief to any person at risk of famine;<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>F<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ifth, seizure of U.S. food or relief equipment; orSixth, prohibiting the monitoring of food relief.If the government engages in any one of these actions, the amendment authorizesthe use of sanctions.It does not mandate sanctions.

Mengistu has combined a murderous assault on human rights with aneconomic program that has made Ethiopia the world's poorest nation. Hehas also prosecuted an endless war against secessionist rebels in two provinces,Eritrea and Tigre. Well, not quite endless: The rebellion in Eritrea beganwhen John F. Kennedy was president.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In this conflict, hunger is just another means of war. The Ethiopianarmy, which has taken a beating lately, is getting ready for a major offensive_notjust against the rebel forces but against the civilian population.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It recently expelled the foreign relief workers who had been distributingfood and medicine in the contested areas. That way, it can commit its crimeswithout witnesses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It also wants the foreign relief agencies to give their supplies andvehicles to the government. They have stoutly refused. The government,you see, isn't interested in taking over their humanitarian mission. Whatit wants is food and trucks to fuel and transport its army.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Food has other uses too, like coercing civilians into doing what theregime wants. What the regime wants is to uproot people from rebelliousregions and move them across the country, depriving guerrilla forces ofsupport. It is also forcing peasants into government-run villages, wherethey can be watched and controlled more easily.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Harvard anthropologist Jason Clay, who interviewed hundreds of victimsfor a book on the 1984-85 famine, found that Ethiopia's government systematicallydenied food to those who resisted being moved. Their choice was submitor perish.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Many did both. According to some witnesses, the hardships of resettlementkilled more people than the famine. The disturbing truth is that the West'sdonations of food often harmed the very people they were supposed to help.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The forced transfer of large numbers of peasants is a key part ofthe regime's nationalization of agriculture.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Here and elsewhere, that has been an infallible recipe for disaster.Regions that once fed Ethiopia's cities can no longer feed themselves.Food production per capita has dropped by 7 percent since Gen. Mengistugained power, just the opposite of what has happened in most of the world'spoorest nations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The nation's health has suffered as a result. Ethiopia's infant mortalityhas risen sharply. Life expectancy at birth is just 45 years. For comparison'ssake, that's 12 years less than in India.

Finally, the Presidentis required to make reports to Congress every 60 days on Ethiopia's conducton ``the response of the United States.''It is my understanding, as the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committeehas already stated, that this language is identical to language recentlyreported out by the House Foreign Affairs Committee as far as its operativerlanguage. We all known there is a terrible tragedy going on in Ethiopiaright now and literally tens of thousands of innocent people are facingterrible conditions including starvation.

The Senator from North Carolina is recognized. [S16MY8-335]{S5907}HELMSMr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, the increasing Cubanization of Panama is a growing realitythat I think this Senate must face if the administration, particularlythe Pentagon, will not. I do not speak for any other Senator, but I justcannot see how we could condone allowing the dictator Noriega in his desperationto stay in power to jeopardize United States interests in the Panama Canal.To this date, I must sadly say the administration has not been willingto take a firm public stand against Noriega and the Cubanization of Panama,nor in my judgment to face up to the hard facts. Now, the Senate did adoptthe D'Amato amendment requesting a public report on the extent of Soviet-Cubanmilitary involvement in Panama. But the administration has ignored thatSenate action, and Mr. Noriega, as anybody knows who has checked the newsin the last 30 minutes, continues to be treated with kid gloves, if notas some kind of favorite son, rather than the thug that he is. Mr. President, let us go back a little more than 10 years, and as Al Smithused to say, ``Let's look at the record.'' On March 3, 1978, the distinguished majority leader of the Senate, Mr.<T4>Byrd, </T4>on behalf of himself and Senator Howard Baker, the thenminority leader, and 76 other Senators offered an amendment to the PanamaCanal Neutrality Treaty in conjunction with the debate on the relinquishmentof the Panama Canal and the territory of United States in the Panama CanalZone. Mr. President, the Byrd-Baker amendment, as it is known, provided the following:[S16MY8-336]{S5907}<ITAG tagnum="21">Under the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operationof the Panama Canal (the Neutrality Treaty), Panama and the United Stateshave the responsibility to assure that the Panama Canal will remain openand secure to ships of all nations. The correct interpretation of thisprinciple is that each of the two countries shall, in accordance with theirrespective constitutional process, defend the canal against any threatto the regime of neutrality, and consequently shall have the right to actagainst any aggression or threat directed against the canal or againstthe peaceful transit of vessels through the canal.</ITAG>Mr. President, that amendment was adopted by the Senate with only threedissenting votes_85 Senators voted for it, 3 Senators voted against it_andit was subsequently accepted by the Republic of Panama and is now a partof the text of article IV of the Panama Canal Treaty. Now, what makes the Byrd-Baker amendment of 10 years ago particularly relevanttoday is the continued reports that I am receiving both from reliable independentsources as well as the news media that for all intents and purposes theSoviets, the Cubans, and the Nicaraguans have moved into Panama. Worsestill, the armed forces of one or more of these countries, notably Soviet-controlledCubans, may have penetrated canal defense areas manned by United Statestroops and may have ac<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>tu<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ally engaged United States troops in combat. Now, I am choosing my words carefully because I do not want to violateany intelligence rules in the process. A principal purpose of the pending amendment that I just offered is todetermine, so that the public can know as well as the Congress, if thesereports are correct. I happen to know of my own knowledge, but I thinkit ought to be made official. I think the American people ought to know.I think certainly that the Congress ought to know, and I certainly thinkthat the Congress ought to pay attention to the information when it isreceived. The amendment does not say that the reports are correct or incorrect. Theamendment simply ensures that the President of the United States who hasaccess to all of the relevant facts will inform the American people aboutthese reports, reports which I will not reiterate that I have been receivingon a regular basis from various sources. I think the American people havea right to know. That is the purpose of this amendment. I hope somehow that these reports will be proved incorrect. But they arethere, reports of Soviet-instigated Cuban military activities in Panama.They are there. I think we need to bear in mind that it would be naiveto the extreme to even think that the dictator Noriega is incapable ofselling his soul, his country, and the Panama Canal to the Communists toreceive the totalitarian political technology, chiefly armed might, thathe needs to stay in power.   Mr. President, I am sure that most Senators are familiar with reports that100,000 Soviet-made AK-47's and Soviet-made rocket-propelled grenade launchersalong with grenades and mortars and other weaponry made to order have beenshipped to Panama and hidden in inac<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>essible sites around the country. If that is nota threat to the Panama Canal, I do not know what would be one.Even more disturbing is a recent report that a Marxist-Lenist ``internationalistbrigade'' so-called consisting of about 1,200 troops has infiltrated intoPanama from where? From Cuba. If this report is true_and I think it is_thenit would be logical to assume that the influx of Soviet <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>w<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eapons is a directly re<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>la<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ted incident because do not forget that the f<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ndest goal in this hemisphere of the Soviet Unionis not merely to get Nicaragua, Cuba, and other countries under the Communistumbrella but to get that Panama Canal. That is what a lot of us warnedabout 10 years ago.In any case, Mr. President, the implications fo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the security of the 50<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>000 <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>A<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>merican citizens in Panama today, and the even greaterstrategic implications of these apparent developments are staggering. Andwe should not be asleep at the switch which is why that amendment is atthe desk right now. That is why I ha<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>v<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e offered it.The Senate and the American people are entitled to know the truth and theyare entitled to learn it from the man they elected twice to be the Presidentof the United States, Ronald Reagan. They are entitled to have from thePresident a formal statement of the facts.If the President confirms that the facts are as reported, then the UnitedStates should take seriously its treaty responsibilities and act to fulfillits obligations under the Byrd-Baker amendment of a little more than 10years ago. The bottom line, Mr. President, at least in the judgment ofthis Senator is that those obligations include the obligations to insistthat the dictator, General Noriega, is brought to justice for drug traffickingaimed at the young people of this country, and our present and future securityas a nation.I will yield the floor in just 1 second.

Mr. President, will the Senator yield? [S16MY8-344]{S5909}HELMSMr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. I yield to my friend. [S16MY8-345]{S5909}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. Mr. President, I do not know what the time situation is on thisamendment. But I want to inquire of the Senator. I read the report somewhere.It slips my mind where I read it. That was about the fact that they werein the process of a firefight that took place between American Marinesand unidentified troops, that some of the people killed were actually CommunistCuban troops, and some were taken to the hospital. Some w<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>re wounded and then they were picked up by the CubanEmbassy or a Cuban interest group in Panama. Does the Senator know anythingabout that?[S16MY8-346]{S5909}HELMSMr. HELMS. I have heard the same reports. We have checked them out. Wefound to the best of our knowledge that they are correct. [S16MY8-347]{S5909}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. Is this the article the Senator referred to?[S16MY8-348]{S5909}HELMSMr. HELMS. That is correct. [S16MY8-349]{S5909}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. Th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s may be the article that I happen to have read.``Other officials have cited conflicting reports that Marines killed atleast two Cuban commandos during the April 12 incident near Howard AirForce Base and wounded six others.'' I think that is something that shouldbe of alarm to all Senators. But the question I would like to ask the Senator, which is very frustratingto him and to this Senator is, as the superpower, the leader of the freeworld, the United States of America seems to be so intimidated that itis afraid to use judicial force when necessary in the preservation of libertyand the preservation of commerce in the Canal Zone, which was up until10 years ago the United States Canal Zone in Panama. It was handed overto these two-bit drug dealers by the thinking here in Congress th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t somehow if we gave the Panama Canal to them, thenthey would start being nice people; the same thinking in my view that keepsus from giving aid to the freedom fighters in Nicaragua. But I guess thequestion<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>is<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>:<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Does the Senator not think it is about time thatthe Congress of the United States admits the failures of the War PowersAct and repeal it, or else the administration test it in court and usejudicial use of military power for the good of the order in a case likePanama? If the United States is so weak, I guess I am asking the Senator,that we cannot get rid of a dictator like Noriega, yet we did try to dothings <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ere that impose hurt and pain on the people, whichthen makes Noriega stronger and makes the United States weaker in the eyesof the people of Panama, that we shou<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ld<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> wake up, are there not time<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> that the judicious use of force, military if necessary,would be more sensible and better for the good of the order than the processt<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ha<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t is taking place? There are two questions. I apologize. [S16MY8-350]{S5909}HELMSMr. HELMS. I am one of the very few Senators who voted against enactmentof the War Power Act. I recall having read the English language of it priorto its being considered on the floor of the Senate. Not being a lawyer,I decided to call on my then colleague from North Carolina, the very able,very distinguished, beloved Sam Ervin, who was a constituti<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nal authority, par excellence. I said: ``Senator,can I come by and see you for a moment? I want to ask you a question.''He said, ``Sure.''I went to his office, and I took a copy of the proposed War Powers Actand I read it to him, and he smiled at me.He said, ``What is your problem?I said: ``I'm not a lawyer, but as a nonlawyer, this seems to be, ipsofacto, unconstitutional.''He grinned and he said: ``You got it. You don't need to be a lawyer toread the English language.''In response to the other part of the Senator's question, I think it isalmost past time for the United States_to use the Senator's words_judiciouslyto defend freedom.I do not think that the President of the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>U<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nited States ought to be hobbled in the conduct offoreign policy, and a key element of foreign policy ought to be the preventionof a takeover of this world by the Soviet Union and communism.It is said: ``Helms sees a Communist under every bed,'' but they are justabout right. They are everywhere.I appreciate the Senator's concern, and on the presumption that he is goingto support my amendment, I thank him.[S16MY8-351]{S5910}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. I am going to vote for the Senator's amendment.When I was in Idaho on the past break, quite a stir was raised by someof the more liberal members of the media, which is a lot of them, aboutthe fact that I made some comment that I believed in the George WashingtonRevolutionary War theory of military, and that is that you never do anythingthat hurts the people of whatever country you are trying to engage with,whether it is the United States in the case of General Washington's ContinentalArmy, or if it is U.S. Army as an invading force in Europe. You try tobe good to the civilian people you are trying to defend, so that you havethe support of the people.In Panama, it seems to me that we have taken a position that is hard onthe people but lets General Noriega go scot free.Of course, the headlines were that <T4>Symms</T4> calls for using military force in Panama. I said that wedo not need to send military force to Panama; we already have militaryforce in Panama.What we need is the political will to back up a clear-cut position, andall we get is a vacillation of our foreign policy that seems to come outof Foggy Bottom. It is never a clear position. The State Department ison one side and the DOD is on the other. In this case, the DOD is againstthe use of any military force. But there is always a confused signal thatseems to come out.I hope that at some time I am long enough in this town to see someone inthe White House who will make a clear decision and give some orders anddirect that we preserve peace and freedom and not be intimidated by it.If the United States of America will not defend peace and freedom in theIsthmus of Panama, then who will, if the United States of America willnot do it? Nobody else is going to do it.I venture to say that if the roles were reversed and it was the SovietUnion that was overseeing a canal zone that they had given to some tinhorn,two-bit dictators who are thieves and trying to undercut the youths oftheir country by sending drugs in, they simply would not have any hestitationto use force if it was necessary to restore a semblance of what they considereda government that was in comity with them.In my view, this whole Panama situation has been badly bungled by everyoneconcerned since the day that the treaty was signed, through the ratificationprocess in the Senate in the late 1970's, through this time period today.Sooner or later, the United States of America is still going to have toaccept the responsibility that we are the leader of the free world. CentralAmerica, Panama_that region is part of the world where we are going tobe the ultimate referee, to decide what the outcome will be; and the soonerwe get on with it, the less bloodshed and tyranny and problems will happen.This situation has been grossly mishandled by the United States. Thereis plenty of blame to go to the Democrats, plenty of blame to go to theRepublicans, plenty of blame to go to people who are not interested inpolitics, plenty of blame for the State Department and DOD. Everybody canshare in this blame. But I believe we should get on with it now.I support the Senator's amendment. At least it will make people focus onthe fact that Noriega's best friends in the Western Hemisphere are FidelCastro and the Ortega brothers.``The Ortega brothers,'' in this Congress, does not mean much. I oftensay at home that it appears, when I look at Congress, that Congress hasnot realized that there is a difference between the Ortega brothers andthe Osmond brothers. I hope that sometime Congress becomes more enlightenedand can recognize that.[S16MY8-352]{S5910}HELMSMr. HELMS. I thank the Senator.The difference between the Soviet Union and the United States was dramaticallyand horribly pinpointed for both the Senator from Idaho and the Senatorfrom North Carolina in 1983, when, by the grace of God, Senator <T4>Symms</T4> and Senator <T4>Helms</T4> were not on that plane that was shot down deliberately andpremeditatedly by the Soviet Union because it was in violation of the airspace.Mr. Noriega is another Keystone Cop exercise by the State Department.It reminds me of the inept husband who did not know anything about babiesor anything else, who was asked by his wife to change the diaper on thebaby, and he took he pins off and left the diaper in place.That is what they are proposing to do in Panama by letting Noriega get,as somebody said, time off for bad behavior, and designate his own successor.You do not deal with tyrants that way. At least, I was raised to believethat you did not. But maybe I have lived too long.In any case, I thank the Senator for his comments, and I yield the floor.[S16MY8-353]{S5910}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I have conversed on this amendment with the chairmanof the Foreign Relations Committee and have talked briefly to the rankingmember, who is proposing this amendment. I agree with much of what the Senator from North Carolina is saying aboutthe situation in Panama and much of what Senator <T4>Symms</T4> has just said. But one of the problems with this amendment,as drafted, is that it would deny funds for the combined board which isset up by the Panama Canal Treaty, and that board has a large bearing onthe protection of the canal. The operation of the board really, basically,works with both the Panamanian forces and the United States military forcesjointly to protect the canal.So, in order to make a very strong point about our disapproval of G<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ral Noriega and the current <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>overnment in Panama, it does not serve our intereststo disrupt the military protection of the canal, and I am afraid that thatis what this would do.I am also afraid that Noriega, in fanning the flames of his own population,wi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>l use this amendment, unless it is changed somewhat,as an effort by the United States to break the Panama Canal Treaty. I thinkthat at this juncture, that kind of fanning <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>of<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the flames, when we have economic sanctions in place,could find very <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eceptive public opinion. So we have to be very carefulabout how we word our efforts to deal with the situation.And I would ask the Senator from North Carolina if he would consider accepti<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ng<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> a possible substitute that would take out any referenceto the combi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ne<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d board established by the Panama Canal Treaty. Thissubs<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>itute would read as follows:<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>[S16MY8-354]{S5910}<ITAG tagnum="21">It is the sense of the Congress that the United States should limitits military cooperation with Panama to those activities essential to thedefense of the Panama Canal or the presence of U.S. Armed F<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>or<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ces in Panama and should provide no further militaryassistance to the Panamanian defense forces if there are any armed forcesof the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, or Cuba, or Nicaragua presentin the Republic of Panama, or as long as Gen.

If the Senator will, let me suggest thatwe have a brief quorum call and let me look at the actual text. I alsohave a suggestion. Maybe we can meld them. I suggest the absence of a quorum.[S16MY8-358]{S5910}NUNNMr. NUNN. I wonder if the Senator would withhold that for a moment.[S16MY8-359]{S5910}HELMSMr. HELMS. Yes.[S16MY8-360]{S5910}NUNNMr. NUNN. I would be delighted to put in that quorum for the purpose ofdiscussing this amendment.Let me ask if on the next amendment, which is the one related to Afghanistan,the Senator would be prepared to enter into a time agreement that wouldlet us have the vote on or before 2:15, the chairman says, and the reasonbeing we have a very important Foreign Relations Committee meeting. I knowthe Senator wants to be there. We could perhaps conclude the debate onthat amendment and begin a vote in time to reach the 2:30 meeting.[S16MY8-361]{S5911}HELMSMr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment, I believe, isabout as straightforward as it could be. The amendment would block fundsto implement the Afghan agreement of April 13 until this Senate receivesfrom the President of the United States those so-called Afghanistan accordsfor advice and consent as a treaty. We have no business dealing in thisfashion, in the judgment of this Senator, on <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>so<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>me sort of agreement that I very much doubt any Senatorhas read.If we are going to get involved in this, this treatymaking, let us makea treaty, not some agreement that has been entered into by the State Department.There are many reasons why I say this: There are many reasons why the Senateshould review the accords in the form of a treaty. The first and main purposefor this review is to prevent any further degradation or diminition ofthe constitutional duty of the Senate to give<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> its advice and consent to any treaty that the UnitedStates signs with another sovereign nation.The second reason, Mr. President, is that the nature of the Afghanistanagreement is so ill-conc<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ei<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ved that the Senate should have the opportunity todebate these issues before it give its advice and consent. Possibly wecould improve the document. All wisdom does not reside in Foggy Bottom.Mr. President, let me summarize, as quickly as I may.The U.S. Department of State, in order to get an agreement with the Soviets,agreed to let the Soviets supply the Soviet installed puppet ``Afghan Army''with weapons and supplies.However, Mr. President, in order to satisfy the U.S. Senate, domestic politicalopinion, and the President, the State Department dreamed up the so-called``symmetry argument''_that is to say, each superpower would have equalability to supply their respective side.So, Mr. President, the State Department in order to satisfy the ``symmetryagrument'' and get an agreement, apparently applied pressure to Pakistanto get Pakistans signature on an agreement that makes it illegal for thePakistanis to ship any arms to the freedom fighters.If that is not a buzzard stew, I never heard of one. What kind of foreignpolicy is that? The Soviets, no doubt, plan to abandon the southern partof Afghanistan for now, but only for now.[S16MY8-375]{S5911}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. Will the Senator yield? I do not want to interrupt the Senator'sspeech, but I thought you asked a question and deserved an answer. Theanswer to the Senator's question is it is a typical policy designed tosnatch defeat from the jaws of victory.This Senator visited Pakistan in <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>January <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>1988 and visited what <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ha<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s happened over there on the border and talked withthe leader of the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>M<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ujah<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n and other leaders that are involved in the effort.Freedom is clearly winning over the Communist Russian, Soviet troops. Clearly,Soviet troops are getting their tails handed to them on a tray over there.All we had to do was keep what we were doing and we were winning anyway.Those Soviet troops will be leaving or else they will have the same fatethat befell the British some 100-plus years ago in this same country. Therewill not be anybody left when it is over.But, no, the United States comes up with some scheme to let them off thehook, which is what Yunis Khalis said to me in January 1988. He said:[S16MY8-376]{S5911}<ITAG tagnum="21">You people in the United States are getting ready to sell us out.We fought, we died, we bled, and now you are getting ready to sell us out.We have a million and a half refugees in Iran, 3 million in <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Pakistan, <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>a million of our own citizens have been killed hereand we are not going to stop until we throw the Soviet Army out, no matterwho helps or who does not.</ITAG>So, for us to sign an agreement that ties the hands of the forces of freedombehind their backs and allows the forces of oppression to have a free reignto fight and kill innocent people is absolutely pathologically irrational.[S16MY8-377]{S5911}HELMSMr. HELMS. I totally agree with the Senator, and I thank him.Mr. President, the result is that while the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Soviets <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>can supply <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>all <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the material and weapons that they want, we willnot be able to use our <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Pakistani <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>pipeline to resupply the freedom fighters.

Mr. President, in northern Afghanistan the Soviets have made treatieswith the local puppet off<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ici<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>als and constructed a massive series of forts andfire bases to protect their political, economic, and military control overthis territory.This northern territory, Mr. President, is the richest in Afghanistan.The north not only provides the nation with more than half its total wheat,barley, and vegetable harvest,<ITAG tagnum="80">but also produces 2 billion cubic meters of gas annually for exportby pipeline to the Soviet Union.</ITAG>The Soviets no doubt plan to abandon the southern part of Afghanistan,and for now, wait for the rebels to become less organized and, low on weapons,and then hit back.Perhaps, Mr. President, the Soviets are planning a creeping extension ofpolitical and military control based from this northern super province.Mr. President, as the freedom fighters' military supplies run low, andthere may be less international political support for their cause whenthe Soviet troops appear to have left. The Soviets could creepingly takeback the rest of Afghanistan from their set of puppet provinces and firebases in the north.Thus it could well be that Soviet hedgemony over Afghanistan is assuredby this agreement.In a post-Afghan agreement era, the political cover will be there for theSoviet apologists to say<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>_<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>a la Nicaragua<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>_<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>``we <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>cannot <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>wreck the peace process and supply arms to the rebels.''The freedom fighters thus would be left to face the Soviet weapons withoutUnited States political and military support.Mr. President, as the Senate is already aware, Soviet orchestrated sabotagehas destroyed the majority of the Afghan's stockpile of arms in Pakistan.That sabotage destroyed the last stockpile of American military aid tothe freedom fighters in Afghanistan and will, according to some reports,take 6 months to replace, even if the United States and Pakistan decideto break the existing laws that were <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>consummated <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>in the recent Afghan agreement.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two articles, one fromthe Washington Post, dated April 24, 1988, titled, ``North AfghanistanSeen as a Pro Soviet Buffer,'' and an op-ed piece from the Hartford Courant,dated Sunday, April 24, 1988, titled ``Even Though Defeated, Soviets Emergeas Victor of Afghanistan War<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,''<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> be printed at this point in the <T4>Record.</T4>There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in the<T4>Record,</T4> as follows:[S16MY8-378]{S5912}[From the <ITAG tagnum="71">[From the Washington Post, Apr. 24 1988]</ITAG>[S16MY8-379]{S5912}NorthAfgh<ITAG tagnum="74">North Afghanistan Seen <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>as<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Pro-Soviet Buffer_It Could Become Naj<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>bullah's Last Redoubt</ITAG>[S16MY8-380]{S5912}(ByDavid <ITAG tagnum="71">(By David B.

The relationship betweenthe politi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>al parties in Peshawar and the actual guerillas fightingin the field is indirect.The guerilla commanders fighting in the field have their bases in local,family, ethnic, and tribal loyalties. They are independent of the direction,command, and control of the Peshawar political parties. They receive assistancein varying degrees, mostly quite limited, from the Peshawar political parties.In 1981, the political parties today were divided into three ``Moderate''and seven ``Islamic fundamentalist'' groupings. The first moderate groupingwhich was established in June 1981 is usually referred to as the Unityof Three. It is composed of the political parties of Ahmad Gailani, MohammadNabi Mohammadi, and Sibghatullah Mojadeddi.The ``Mahaz-i-Milli Islami'' (National Islamic Front) is led by Sayed AhmadGaila<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ni<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. Gailani is from a well respected traditional Islamicreligious family. His organization has a Pushtun cast with support in sixsouthern border provinces. Gailani's views are democratic and nationalist.The ``Harakat-i-Enqilab-i-Islami'' (Islamic Revolutionary Movement) ledby Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi is loosely organized and pragmatic po<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>li<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tically and ideologically.The ``Jabha-i-Milli Nijat'' (National Liberation Front) led by SibghatullahAl-Mojadeddi, a highly regarded Islamic scholar, is traditional and Pushtunin orientation.The Islamic fundamentalist grouping was formed of six parties in August1981 and expanded to seven parties in March 1982. The group was referredto as the Unity of Six and later as the Unity of Seven. The groups areas follows.The ``Jamiat-i-Islami'' (Islamic Society) is led by Professor BurhanuddinRabbani and is mainly Tajik in ethnic composition. This organization hasguerilla affiliates active in the northern provinces from Herat in thenorthwest to Badakhstan in the northeast. Guerilla commanders affiliatedwith this organization include: Ahmed Shah Massoud (Panjshir Valley), Zabiullah(Balkh province), and Ismael Khan (Herat province).The ``Hezb-i-Islami'' (Islamic Party) led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar a Moslemextremist whose views have been anti-Western. Hekmatyar is disliked byother leaders, including moderates, for his ruthless and self-serving behavior.The ``Hezb-i-Is<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>la<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mi'' (Islamic Party) led by Yunis Khalis is a breakawayfaction from Gulbuddin's party. As a military group it conducts guerillasactivities principally in Kabul and Nangarhar provinces.The ``Itihad-i Islami Baraye Azadi Afghanistan'' (Islamic Union for theLiberation of Afghanistan) led by Abd-i-Rab Rasoul Sayaf also has an extremistIslamic ideology which looks for an Iranian style government with an anti-Westernorientation. The group, however, has few if any guerillas forces.The ``Harakat-i-Enqilab Islami'' (Islamic Revolutionary Movement) is ledby Nassrallah Mansour who broke away f<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ro<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>m Nabi Mohammadi's ``Harakat'' organization in 1981.The party is without significant influence and has no effective guerillaforces inside Afghanistan.The ``Harakat-i-Enqilab Islami'' (Islamic Revolutionary Movement) led byRafioullagh al-Mousin who, like Mansour, broke away from the original ``Harakat''in 1981. The organization has a negligible following.The ``Islamic Front' led by Mohammad Mir is a breakaway from Mojadeddi'sparty with few followers and no affiliated guerrilla bands.In 1985, a combined resistance alliance composed of 7 of the 10 partieswas formed and has come to be known as the Peshawar resistance alliance.The current leader of the alliance, Mohammad Yunis Khalis, was electedas leader for an 18 month term on November 8, 1987. The seven leaders comprisingthe alliance are: Khalis, Sebghatullah Mojadeddi, Pir Sayyid Ahmad Gailani,Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Prof. Burhanuddin Rabbani, Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi,and Adb al-Rab Abd ul-Rassul Sayyaf.Deeply disturbing are numerous reports that the United States as well asPakistan have given the bulk of assistance and support to Hekmatyar andhis extremist Islamic organization. Hekmatyar is reported to have influenceover no more than 10 per cent of the guerillas fighting inside Afghanistan.These reports indicate that moderate resistance organizations have notreceived the level of assistance that they deserve. Persistant reportsfrom sources familiar with the main guerilla commanders inside Afghanistanindicate that very little assistance from Western sources has reached them.They rely on what they can capture from the Soviets and their Afghan surrogates.Further disturbing reports have circulated which indicate that significantamounts of Western assistance, including U.S. assistance, which was intendedfor the Af<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>han freedom fighters have been diverted to Khomeini'sregime in Iran. It would certainly be an appalling and morally repugnantsituation for our government to have used the Afghan freedom struggle asa cover in order to funnel weapons to Khomenini in his mad war againstIraq.[S16MY8-386]{S5914}the gueril<ITAG tagnum="89">the guerilla commanders inside afghanistan</ITAG>Mr. President, the real freedom fighting takes place on the ground insideAfghanistan irrespective of the activities of the exile political partiesbased in Peshawar, Pakistan, As I have indicated, the commanders of theguerilla organizations fighting inside Afghanistan are the real heart ofthe struggle.While some of these commanders do have relations of varying degrees withthe external exile political parties, these relations are secondary tothe military conflict inside. The future of Afghanistan will in large measurebe determined by the battlefield successes of the military commanders andtheir guerilla fighters rather than by the negotiations political partiesin exile.Mr. President, it is a fact that the guerilla commanders and their bravetroops fighting inside Afghanistan have not been conquered in 8 years ofbloody struggle. In fact, the guerillas who are fighting inside Afghanistanhave been gaining in strength and have been consistently defeating theSoviet enemy in spite of every conceivable challenge posed by the Sovietmilitary machine.Among the most well known guerilla commanders are Ahmed Shah Massoud, Aminwardak, Abdul Haq, and Ismail Khan. There are many fine commanders withdistinguished records. Today, I shal<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>just mention four owing to constraints of time.Ahmed Shah Massoud is of Tajik background and is known for his valiantand steadfast fighting in his native Panjshir Valley in Kapisa province.He is the son of a retired army brigadier general and attended the prestigiousFrench run Istiqlal School in Kabul. His organization is reported to encompassguerilla groups in the neighboring Baghlan, Takhar, and Badakhshan provinces.Amin Wardak leads the main guerilla group in Wardak province and has closeties with resistance groups in Logar, Bamyan, Paktia, and Ghazni provinces.He is a graduate of the French run Istiqlal School in Kabul.Abdul Haq is of Pushtun background and operates in the Kabul region. Hisinfluence spreads to guerilla groups in <ITAG tagnum="80">the Ghazni, Zabul, Kandahar, and Paktia provinces which border Pakistan.</ITAG>Ismail Khan is regional commander in Herat and the west of Afghanistan.His region includes Herat, Badghisat, and Fariab provinces. Over the pastyear he has continued to significantly broaden his areas of influence inthe west.In July 1987, Ismail Khan chaired the most broadly based meeting of commandersever held within Afghanistan. The meeting took place at a secret locationin a remote part of southern Ghor province. The meeting released a communiquewhich called for practical measures to improve military coordination includingimproved communication. The communique demanded military and politicalunity and chastised the political leaders for not being able to work together.It also called for the establishment of a national commanders' counciland a role in the determining of the future of Afghanistan.Mr. President, I would emphasize that the Afghan resistance has been growingever more powerful and the cumulative military successes in 1987 boostedmorale to the highest level since the Soviet invasion in December 1979.[S16MY8-387]{S5915}The Partit<ITAG tagnum="89">The Partition of Afghanistan</ITAG>Mr. President, there is no question in the mind of this Senator that theSoviets intend to remain entrenched in the northern third of the countryprotected by the Hindu Kush.It is in the north where the Soviets have built several hundred manufacturingand industrial factories. It is in the north where the natural gas productiontakes place and where it is diverted to the Soviet Union.Even before the advent of Islam, the Hindu Kush separated the Hindu fromthe world of Zoroaster in Persia. This formidable barrier marks the dividingline between Central and Southern Asia. It forms one of the greatest andleast known mountain ranges in the world which have been, are, and willalways be strategic.The Hindu Jush dominate Afghanistan. They run westward from its highestpoint_24,891 feet_in the Pamir mountains in adjacent Soviet territory almostto the Iranian frontier.The Hindu Kush actually refers only to the eastern and central parts ofthe mountain chain. Where this joins the center of the Pamirs, the systembecomes continuous with the Karakorum range, itself a western arm of theHimalayas. The Hindu Kush originates on the ``bam-e-dunya'' (``roof ofthe world'') in the steep northeastern corner of the country, wh<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>re the narrow Wakhan corridor inserts a panhandlewhich separates the Soviet Union, China, and Pakistan. The Soviets haveeffectively annexed the Wakhan corridor.Along a southwesterly route, the Hindu Kush divides the vast valleys ofthe Amu Darya_the ancients' Oxus River_and the Indus River basin, forminga succession of a ridges of high peaks containing snow and glaciers. Atthe Pakinstan border, the altitude begins to drop near the source of theBashgul River and continues to drop all the way to Kabul_7,820 feet. About125 miles from Kabul, it connects with the Koh-i-Baba (``Ancestral Mountains''),thus extending the watershed to the vicinity of Bamyan in central Afghanistan.At this point, the Hindu Kush divides into two parallel ranges called theSiah Koh (``Black Mountains'') and the Safed Koh (``White Mountains'')and, while still losing elevation, becomes the Firozkoh (``Turquoise Mountains'').These latter are the so-called Paropamisus a word which Aristotle usedin his ``Meteorologica'' in 330 B.C. to describe the Hindu Kush. The Paropamisusacts as a barrier between Herat and the Soviet Union.Mr. President, this strategic geography which was well known to the ancientshas not been lost on the Soviets. They know precisely what the significanceof all this real estate is. The massive and feverish Soviet activity whichwas detected this spring in the last several months in this region leavesno room for doubt about Soviet intentions.The Soviets have during the months of February, March, and April of thisyear conducted massive logistical operations bringing supplies to the northernnine provinces. These operations have included truck caravans which have<ITAG tagnum="80">contained in excess of 500 and even 1,000 trucks at a time. Air operationsinvolving Antononov-12 and Antonov-26 transport aircraft bringing tonsof supplies to this northern region have been detected. The Soviets havereportedly built a system of fortresses in a line extending across thenorthern provinces which can be covered by aircraft from over a dozen airbaseson the Soviet side of the border with Afghanistan.</ITAG>With these operations completed, the Soviets have prepositioned all thesupplies that they need for the near and medium term occupation of thenorthern third of Afghanistan.The State Department has tried to promote the notion that it achieved somesort of success at the Geneva <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>m<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eetings which resulted in the so-called arrangementsfor Soviet withdrawal.Far from successful, these arrangements allow the Soviets to retain theirmassive stockpiles in northern Afghanistan to be used to reinforce theKabul puppet regime of Najibullah. On the other hand, the United Statesmust halt assistance to the freedom fighters. This is far from the ``symmetrical''arrangement described by Foggy Bottom. In fact, it is reported that themassive explosions at weapons arsenals in Pakistan in recent weeks destroyedWestern stockpiles for the freedom fighters.Mr. President, in conclusion let me state that in the weeks to come wein the Senate have a responsibility to keep out attention focused on Afghanistanand, indeed, Pakistan, Kashmir, and India. We cannot look aside thinkingthat all has been so<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ved by the diplomatic negotiations at Geneva. Farfrom it.Mr. President, I do not doubt that the world is now going to witness anew phase of Soviet activity in the region as the Kremlin seeks to increaseits hegemonic strategic position in the region through new and complexmanoevres. It is not outside the bounds of possibility that a war willerrupt owing to Indian aggression against Pakistan. Should this take place,the further Balkanization of the region will result. The Soviet partitionof Afghanistan marks the new phase of the battle in this ancient crossroadof civilization.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. <T4>Graham</T4>). The Senator from Rhode Island.[S16MY8-388]{S5915}PELLMr. PELL. Mr. President,<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>he Geneva accords require that half of the Soviettroops in Afghanistan be withdrawn by August 15, 1988. The remaining halfare to be removed by February 15, 1989.Most observers believe that the Soviets will meet these deadlines. Manyexpect the Soviets to completely withdraw before the end of this year,if not before.This amendment is gratuitous and misch<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>iev<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ous. If enacted, it would severely embarrass thePresident on the eve of the summit with Secretary Gorbachev.It could also be counterproductive. If the role of the United States asguarantor of the Geneva accords is put into abeyance until the Senate approvesby a two-thirds majority vote, we run the risk of delaying the entire process.By all accounts, both public and private, the Soviets are indeed implementingtheir withdrawal. I believe the adoption of this amendment, at this time,would be very unwise. One of its results would be that more Afghans woulddie. I urge my colleagues to support the floor manager's tabling motion.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.[S16MY8-389]{S5915}HUMPHREYMr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, every one of us can take pleasure in markingthe beginning of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. It is importantto note that this is only a beginning, that the Soviets under the timetableagreed to have 9 months.There was considerable concern that the Soviets might not withdraw fully;that, in fact, they might leave their troops in the northern provinces,above the Hindu Kush Mountains, where they can more safely occupy the territoryof Afghanistan. I have no idea whether they are going to do that or not.I think the best way to ensure against that, the best way to ensure theSoviets comply completely and on schedule is to keep the Afghan resistancewell armed. That is the best insurance policy we can take out.For, let us remember<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>that the Soviets, notwithstanding all of the PR picturesof the last few days, are not withdrawing out of any noble sentiment. Theyhave not gotten soft, after 9 years of slaughtering a million and a quarterAfghans, most of whom were civilians. They have not gone soft. They areleaving because they are no longer willing to pay the price of occupationexacted by the Afghan resistance.The resistance has been able to exact that increasingly high cost, becausethey have been supplied with the wherewithal by various friendly parties.So I simply reiterate, the best way to ensure the completion of this process,whose beginning was marked yesterday, this process of Soviet withdrawalfrom Afghanistan is to keep the resistance well armed.On that point, Mr. President, there is considerable danger to the pipelinethrough which these weapons flow to the resistance. And those dangers ariseout of the very Geneva agreements which the Senator from North Carolinais seeking to bring before the Senate that the Senate might pass its judgmenton that agreement.A month ago in Geneva, Secretary Shultz obligated the United States toact as a guarantor of several written agreements relative to the war inAfghanistan. These agreeme<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nts<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> arose out of, I guess, 6 or 7 years of negotiationssponsored by the United Nations. That sounds very legitimate, does it not?When you say the United Nations sponsored negotiations which led to documents,which led to a signing ceremony, it sounds very legitimate. But the importantpoint to remember is that there was not one single legitimate representativeof the Afghan people present during even 1 day of those negotiations overmany years.The people who we <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>have c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>alled legitimate represenatives of the Afgha<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> people<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>;<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> namely, the Afghan resistance, were excluded fromthese talks which have such a vital bearing on the future of their country.Who was there representing Afghanistan but the very puppet government setup by the Soviet invaders and against whom we have been encouraging theresistance to fight, even <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>at<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the cost of their own lives.So there was our Secretary of State blessing an agreement reached, in theabsence of the people whose cause we have embraced, and reached, instead,by a puppet government with absolutely no legitimacy at all except 120,000Soviet troops armed with the latest aircraft, helicopters, tanks, and antipersonnelweapons which have been used without compunction, not only against combatants,but especially against the noncombatants_men and women, elderly and children,refugees, innocents wiped out, not by the tens of thousands, not by thehundreds of thousands, but, according to a study financed by the FrenchGovernment 6 months ago, to the extent of 1.25 million, most of whom werecivilians.A million and a quarter dead people. Think of it, Mr. President. That hasbeen the sacrifice of the Afghan people in their effort to throw out theforeign invader. A million and a quarter. It is almost incomprehensibleIt is even<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>more incomprehensi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>bl<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e when you measure it against a standard. When youapply the ratio of the combat deaths_I should not call them combat deaths.I should call them deaths because I do not want to imply these are thedeaths of soldiers. These are mostly the deaths of persons no<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> involved in combat. When you apply that ratio, a million and a quarter of the Afghans, againstthe population of the United States, it works out out to 16 <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>or<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> 17 million dead Americans. That is the price theAfghans have paid thus far_it is not over yet_in seeking to restore theindependence of their country. And who was representing the Afghan people who suffered so terribly atthese United Nations-sponsored talks in Geneva? The resistance? No, thepuppet government set up by 120,000 Soviet soldiers, that is who was representingAfghanistan. Can anybody wonder why the resistance repudiated these agreements, repudiatedthe negotiations? Hardly any wonder at all. Who would not? We certainlywould in their place. The Senator visited and meet 5 weeks ago with six of the seven leadersof the parties and the deputy leader of the seventh. During a meeting,which ultimately lasted 3 hours, these leaders repeatedly pleaded withthis Senator to try to stop the signing of these agreements_this was justa few days before the agreements were signed_saying, ``Look, we weren'tinvolved in the negotiations. These are illegitimate documents. But morethan that, they put us, they put the resistance at a distinct disadvantage,''and they do so for these two reasons: First, one of the agreements betweenthe parties states that Pakistan will not interfere in the internal affairsof Afghanistan.  <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Sterile sounding enough, but what it means in thissituation is that under the agreements, Pakistan is bound to stop armingthe Afghan resistance. Take Pakistan out of the picture and it is impossibleto provide assistance to the Afghan resistance because of geography.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The only way to get the stuff into the resistanceis through Pakistan. If Pakistan were to comply with these agreements,as she is bound effective yesterday, the pipeline would be cut off immediately,the resistance would be progressively disarmed as they use up their ammunitionin the next few months.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>And what is the outcome? The Soviets win at the bargainingtable with the help of the State Department what they could not succeedin winning through 9 years of merciless warfare against the elderly, thechildren, the men and the women of Afghanistan.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>That is what happens under these agreements if Pakistancomplies. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The State Department claims that they made everythingall right by reading a unilateral statement at the conclusion of this signing.Remember, a unilateral statement is not part of the agreements. It is merelywords on a piece of paper that was read by our representatives which saythat as long as the Soviets continue to supply this Soviet-puppet governmentin Kabul that we are going to continue to supply the Afghan resistance.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Well, that is fine, except how do you do it if thepipeline is breached? How do you do it if Pakistan complies with this samevery agreement? It is poppycock. It is nothing but hot air and hypocrisy.It is a lie.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>We now have to depend on Pakistan violating thisvery agreement if we are to make good on the words of this unilateral statementand, more, if we are to make good on the statement of reassurance issuedby President Reagan to the resistance on several occasions this year whenhe said that we would stand by them.The Geneva agreements contain a lie, a contrad<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ic<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tion, an hypocrisy, cynicism. There are many withinthe administration and within the Senate <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>who,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> in private at least, have been highly critical ofthe State Department and of this administration for associating itselfwith this arrangement which has come out of Geneva.  So we put the resistance at a disadvantage in the sense that the pipelineto them remains open only if Pakistan violates the agreement. Believe,me, Pakistan, as the Senators will see in the weeks and months ahead, isgoing to come under enormous pressure to cease its violations form theSoviet Union, obviously, from India, probably, and from every other countrythat wants to make trouble.  If that is not bad enough, Pakistan, under its political system, is boundto have parliamentary elections sometime in the next 2 years or so. Sometimein the next 2 years, Pakistan has to have nationwide parliamentary elections.So in that context, with Pakistan coming under increasing pressure andcriticism, not to mention KGB-supported terrorism within Pakistan, onehas to worry about the integrity of that pipeline, that lifeline, the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>only<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> lifeline on which the resistance depend and mustdepend for success.  [S16MY8-390]{S5916}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. Will the Senator yield for a question on that point?  [S16MY8-391]{S5916}HUMPHREYMr. HUMPHREY. Yes.  [S16MY8-392]{S5916}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. I thank the Senator for yielding. I want to say, Mr. President,I thank the Senator for the points he is making, which I totally concurwith.  When I was in Pakistan, in January, I got the distinct impression fromour people in the field, State Department employees, some of them militaryadvisers, and others involved with the U.S. Government, that they sharedthe viewpoint the Senator and I are speaking of today, and that is thatwe should stay the course, we should not deviate from our current program,because it is working, and continue to sustain it.  Without mentioning the names of any people out there, did the Senator getthe impression 5 weeks ago that they were fearful of the agreement thatwas about to be signed, that it was going to leave them with the rug jerkedout from under them in what they had told people?  [S16MY8-393]{S5917}HUMPHREYMr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, before I respond, let me ask for the yeasand nays on this amendment. For my part, I do not have a great deal moreto say but I do want to have an opportunity to say it.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested. Is therea sufficient second?

Can the Senator forbear for just a moment?[S16MY8-398]{S5917}DIXONMr. DIXON. Of course.[S16MY8-399]{S5917}HUMPHREYMr. HUMPHREY. I would be happy to hear the Senator from Illinois.[S16MY8-400]{S5917}DIXONMr. DIXON. I just wanted to ask my good friend from New Hampshire whetherit will require much more time to discuss this since a number of my distinguishedcolleagues want to repair to the Foreign Relations Committee Room and atthe appropriate time I was to offer a motion to table.[S16MY8-401]{S5917}HUMPHREYMr. HUMPHREY. Our foreign relations are badly in need of repair so I certainlywill not hold up the Senate. Indeed, we might invite the Secretary of Stateto come in because he needs to hear this. He does not hear it from hissycophants down the road. But in any event, in answer to the Senator'squestion, this is not my amendment but speaking only for myself perhapsI can wind up in 5 minutes or so, not counting whatever my friend, Mr.<T4> Symms,</T4> uses.The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from New Hampshire will withhold,the Senator from New Hampshire had requested the yeas and nays. The Chairwas about to <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ask<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> if there is a sufficient second when the Senatorfrom Illinois requested permission to make an inquiry. Does the Senatorfrom New Hampshire pursue the request for the yeas and nays?[S16MY8-402]{S5917}HUMPHREYMr. HUMPHREY. I make that request.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficientsecond.The yeas and nays were ordered.[S16MY8-403]{S5917}HUMPHREYMr. HUMPHREY. I thank the Chair for its assistance.To answer the question from the Senator from Idaho, yes, indeed, the resistanceleaders were alarmed to a man, angry, resentful, for which I cannot blamethem a bit.[S16MY8-404]{S5917}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. These are American employees or leaders of the Mujahidin?[S16MY8-405]{S5917}HUMPHREYMr. HUMPHREY. I am speaking of the Afghan resistance leaders, the politicalleadership with whom I met. Did I misunderstand the question?[S16MY8-406]{S5917}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. I was at a meeting with Mohammad Khalis, Mr. President, if theSenator will yield, and in the course of this conversation the young manwho represents the U.S. State Department, who lives in Peshawar, made thepoint to Khalis that I was speaking as a U.S. Senator who had a strongopinion, he was speaking as a member of the U.S. Government, but that hisGovernment was not going to undercut, ``sell-out,'' the Mujahidin. AndKhalis, the leader of the Mujahidin was convinced in January that the superpowerswould get together and cut a cozy little deal and <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>leave<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> these poor brave freedom fighters stranded in thefield short of equipment and strung out with the powe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>rf<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ul Soviet Union and a massive army there.Now, what I <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>am <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>trying to get at, the Senator was there 5 weeks agoso that was in March or April. I want to know if the State Department peoplewho are <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>out<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> there in the field shared the opinion that was beingmade back here at Foggy Bottom. That is the question I am trying to get<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>at.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Because I came out of Pakistan really proud of theAmericans I met there who were representing the United States of America.I wondered if they had compromised to where they are supporting what Ithink has the potential to be a disastrous agreement to snatch defeat fromthe jaws of victory in Afghanistan.[S16MY8-407]{S5917}HUMPHREYMr. HUMPHREY. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>The<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> answer is that I just do not recall, and if I did<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> I do not believe I would want to state in this Chamberif any subordinate in the State Department was opposing the party line,but certainly some have still do express dismay and regret and horror atwhat the State Department has done. Mr. President, the resi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>st<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ants are concerned on many counts. They were notinvolved in the negotiations. Indeed, the very puppet regime against whichwe have encouraged them to<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> fi<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ght represented illegitimately the Afghan peopleat those talks.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>The second point is that only if Pakistan flagrantly violates this agreementwill the pipeline, on which they depend exclusively, remain open to theresistance. The third point is that the State Department has permitted the Sovietsto transform their public relations problem,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> into our public relations problem, because now theSoviets under these agreements are perfectly free to resupply militarilyand in every way, and as lavishly as they wish, this puppet regime in Kabul.There is not one word of restriction on the Soviets with respect to theirpropping up this puppet regime contained in these Geneva agreements. On the other hand, as I pointed out on the side of the resistance, Pakistanis required to cease arming the resistance and only if Pakistan is willingto violate these agreements and withstand the pressure and the criticismcan we keep the resistance armed. Fourth, we put the Soviets in charge of our program. We have put Moscowin the driver's seat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> because in this unilateral statement which was readat Geneva we pledged to cut off assistance to the Afghan freedom fightersif the Soviets cut off assistance to this puppet regime. And so here we have this 8-year program which friendly countries have providedthe Afghan resistance with the wherewithal to throw the Soviet occupierout of Afghanistan, here we have it coming to a successful conclusion<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and all the Soviets have to do to cut off the flowof arms to the Afghan resistance under this Geneva agreement is to claimthat they have cut off aid to their puppet government, and then we arerequired to cut off aid to the Afghan resistance. It is a mess. It is disgraceful.It is a very dangerous development. In the long run, 6 months or more,time is now on the side of the Soviets, so we had better keep the resistancewell armed that they can finish the job as quickly as possible. Mr. President, at the very least this matter bears serious detailed examinationby the Senate. I believe the State Department has pulled a fast one, andI hope the Senate will adopt the pending amendment so that these agreementswill be carefully examined by the Senate. [S16MY8-408]{S5917}DIXONMr. DIXON<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> and<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Mr. SYMMS addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois. [S16MY8-409]{S5917}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, I did not want to foreclose my distinguishedfriend from Idaho if he has further remarks, because I was going to makevery brief remarks and then move to table. Did my friend from Idaho havemore he wanted to say? [S16MY8-410]{S5917}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. I say to my friend I just wanted to make a couple or three moreminutes of remarks. [S16MY8-411]{S5917}DIXONMr. DIXON. Then if it is all right with my friend from Idaho, I will withholdmy brief closing remarks and motion to table until my friend has concluded.[S16MY8-412]{S5917}SYMMSMr. SYMMS addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.   [S16MY8-413]{S5918}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. Mr. President, I think the chairman of the Free AfghanistanCaucus, Senator <T4>Humphrey,</T4> has really framed the issue before the Senate. But Ido think there are three of four points that need to be reemphasized todayin this very important vote to sen<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>he right signal to the world.No. 1, the reason the Soviet Army is withdrawing from Afghanistan is becausethey are being defeated on the field of battle by the mujaheddin who havebeen armed and supported by the United States and other countries in theworld.The Stinger missile completely changed the context and the strategy andtactics of the war. I think it should be noted, however, that Mr. Gorbachev,the great grandfather and friendly image to the Western media_and I notesome people in this country somehow think he is a new person, and he maybe new and we hope he is new, but I might say to my friends that the SovietUnion is supporting terrorism being aimed against the civilian populationof Pakistan. There were 250 innocent Pakistanis killed in 1987, another750-plus were wounded with bombs going off, and so forth.Recently, these terrorists blew up a huge munitions yard where a greatmany of the supplies that we have spent a great deal of time, money, andeffort to get to that position were exploded and detonated. Many valuableweapons that are needed by the Mujahe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>in, the freedom fighters, resistance fighters, tocarry on the war have been lost because of State-supported terrorism backedby the Soviet Union.I think it is interesting to note for the <T4>Record</T4> that we, the United States of America responded, correctlyso, in this Senator's opinion not strongly enough, but at least we madea good-faith effort in the bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi, because theLibyans had been involved, caught red-handed and involved in State-supportedterrorist acts.Mr. President, the Soviet Union is now conducting state-supported terroris<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> acts against innocent people in Pakistan. They aretrying to intimidate the Government of Pakistan. People like to say thisis a Soviet Vietnam. This is not a Soviet Vietnam. In the Vietnam conflictthe United States won the battle on the battlefield and lost the war herein Washington. What we are allowing the Soviet Union to do_if we do notstand firm and keep sending the supplies to the Mujahe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>in and give them plenty of supplies, adequate Stingermissiles so they can protect their troops from air threats_is to lose thebattle on the battlefield but win the battle politically. Then we willbe snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. I think it is a most importantvote.So I urge colleagues to support the Senator from New Hampsire and the Senatorfrom North Carolina, vote with them on this issue, and vote against thetabling motion. I yield the floor. [S16MY8-414]{S5918}DIXONMr. DIXON addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois. [S16MY8-415]{S5918}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, I believe this is another example of the attemptto fix something that is not broken. This agreement is a historic achievement.For the first time, Soviet forces are leaving a country they have occupied.The Mujahed<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n have achieved a military victory over the Sovietoccupation forces. The Soviets have now begun their withdrawal. One-half of the Soviets will be withdrawn by August 15, and the remainderwithin 9 months. Thus, the agreement is working. Presidents frequently enter into executive agreements, as we all know,which are not referred to the Senate for advice and consent. There is noestablished legal principles setting forth a difference between an executiveagreement and a treaty. Presidents have entered into thousands of executiveagreements, some of them similar to this one. So, Mr. President, there is nothing unusual about the arrangement here.There is no reason to require that this be submitted for advice and consent.More importantly, if it were submitted, it would destroy a very effectivedocument that would otherwise achieve a historic result. In my opinion,Mr. President, if you want to stop those Soviet tanks in their tracks asthey are leaving Afghanistan, you ought to support this amendment. If youwant to bring peace to Afghanistan, you ought to support the motion totable which I am about to offer after conlcuding remarks by the distinguishedmanager.In view of the fact that there is another committee meeting shortly, Imove to table the amendment by the distinguished Senator from North Carolinaand I ask for the yeas and nays.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficientse<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>co<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nd.The yeas and nays were ordered.[S16MY8-416]{S5918}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, if the clerk will withhold, let me just inquire.I saw the Senator from North Carolina as I was leaving. He indicated hepreferred this vote be delayed. Did he leave any such instructions on thaton the floor?I want to accommodate him. If he woul<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> prefer the vote occur after the capital punishmentvote which would be after 4 o'clock, I would want to accommodate him.[S16MY8-417]{S5918}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. If the Senator will yield, I have not received any specificinstructions from what Senator <T4>Helms </T4>wished. I am informed by his staff that they thought thatwould be more suitable to him. But he did not say anything to this Senatorabout it. So maybe that would be acceptable if there is no objection toit.[S16MY8-418]{S5918}DIXONMr. DIXON. May I say, if the Senator has no objection, there are a lotof amendments that could occur yet today. If we could dispose of this rollcall<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>now, I had no request from the Senator from NorthCarolina.[S16MY8-419]{S5918}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. I had no request. So let us vote.[S16MY8-420]{S5918}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have not been able to reach the Senator fromNorth Carolina. Since a number of Senators are coming back for this rollcallvote and understand that it would occur now, I think the Senator from NorthCarolina will understand. We will hold the Panama amendment and set itaside temporarily until this vote occurs. We will vote on this one.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to tablethe amendment. On this question the yeas and nays have been ordered, andthe clerk will call the roll.The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.[S16MY8-423]{S5918}CRANSTONMr. CRANSTON.

Without objection, it is so ordered.[S16MY8-444]{S5919}D'AMATOMr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, one of the areas of the drug epidemic thatwe have overlooked is the area of punishment. This Senator is not goingto suggest, as some might editorialize, that any one punishment, no matterhow strict it is, is going to end the drug epidemic. That would be naive.As a matter of fact, Mr. President, let me say that I took some offense,some umbrage, at the suggestion that this body had the naivete to suggestthat, by involving the military in attempting to interdict and in certaincases make arrests of the drug planes that are coming in and the boatsthat are bringing these cargoes of death and destruction, that would endthe epidemic. That is nonsense.Mr. President, as important as education is_and it is important and thecornerstone_and rehabilitation,<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>which is necessary, it is equally important thatpeople understand that if they are going to savage our people by supportingdrugs, if they are going to t<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ke the lives of others with reckless abandon, asthey have, if they are going to strike down our police officers, be theyFederal, State, or local, as they have with increasing impunity, that thereis another side to this, and that is called punishment.Mr. President, I think we have to find a clearer message for those whodeal in drugs, that if you kill someone while dealing with drugs, if youorder a death, then you can and you will face the death penalty under certainprescribed standards, which this amendment adheres to. And that is thetoughest penalty that society can mete out. This epidemic calls for nothingless than the toughest.Mr. President, the death-dealing drug lords fear no one today_no one. Theytake on our police officers. They literally machinegun our neighborhoods,killing innocent people, because they have total disdain for human life.Right now, the only thing that the death-dealing drug lords will ever fearis death itself. That is why, Mr. President, unfortunately we have to movewith swiftness to see to it that we do have a death penalty as it relatesto the drug kingpins who order the assassination of police officers orwho order a hit and who supervise a criminal conspiracy, a continuing criminalenterprise, which is defin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d in section 21 U<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nited <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>tates<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Code 848.Because the penalties are so severe, the continuing criminal drug enterprisestatute requires five stringent elements of proof for conviction:First, the defendant's conduct must constitute a felony violation of narcoticslaws.Second, that conduct must take place as a continuing series of violationsof the Federal narcotics laws.Third, the defendant must undertake this activity in<ITAG tagnum="80">concert with five or more people.</ITAG>Fourth, the defendant must act as the organizer, supervisor, or manager,known as the kingpin, of this criminal enterprise.Fifth, the defendant must obtain substantial income or resources from thisenterprise.The amendment also provides that:[S16MY8-445]{S5919}<ITAG tagnum="21">Any person, during the commission of, in furtherance of, or whileattempting to avoid apprehension, prosecution or punishment for, an actthat violates the Controlled Substances Act, who intentionally, or withreckless indifference to human life_</ITAG>Just last week we read the case in New York where tragically a 20-year-oldwoman was killed because the drug gangs did not care who in their neighborhoodwas exposed to their shooting_[S16MY8-446]{S5920}with reckl<ITAG tagnum="20">with reckless indifference to human life, kills or participates substantiallyin the killing of any Federal, State, of local law enforcement officerengaged in, or on account of, the performance of such officer's officialduties, shall be sentenced to any term of imprisonment, which shall notbe less than 20 years, and which may be up to life imprisonment, or maybe sentenced to death.</ITAG>This amendment has been carefully crafted to withstand constitutional scrutinyunder recent Supreme Court rulings. For the death penalty to be applied,the Supreme Court held that the killer must have had specific intent tokill or have had acted with reckless indifference to human life and musthave actually killed or must have been a substantial participant in theactivity leading to the killing.Mr. President, there are a number of reasons to support capital punishment.Let me simply suggest to you that it does deter murder.Let me quote one case. After the shooting of Rosa Velez to her death, inmy State, in her home in Brooklyn, NY, when the perpetrator was caughtin the act of burglary, this is what he said:[S16MY8-447]{S5920}<ITAG tagnum="21">Yeah, I shot he<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. She knew me and I knew I wouldn't go to the chair.</ITAG>A law that actually encourages criminals like Louis Vera to kill theirvictims, I suggest, must be changed, and particularly as it relates tothe dealers of death and destruction in a continuing criminal drug enterprise,the drug lords and those who work for them and those who demonstrate thisruthlessness of taking over neighborhoods, of threatening people with death,of assassinating even police officers as we have recently seen too often,too tragically.Mr. President, to satisfy the constitutional requirements for the impositionof capital punishment, the amendment requires that there be advanced noticeof the Government's intention to seek the death penalty. The amendmentprovides for consideration of specific mitigating and aggravating factors.The burden of proof regarding such aggravating factors rests upon the Government,while the defendant bears the burden of proof regarding mitigating factors.The death penalty may be imposed only by the unanimous vote of the jury.I would suggest that that is as it should be. I do not think that any oneof us would want to have that burden of saying that he or she alone wouldmake that decision, but by the unanimous vote of the jury.Let us discuss how this legislation would work and what type of cases thislegislation could potentially cover.We have heard much, recently, about the ``posses'' and the gangs involvedin drug dealing and the violence that accompanies that involvement. Underthe first part of our amendment if a member of a drug gang is involvedin a continuing criminal enterprise and kills an individual or p<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rticipates substantially in the killing of an individual,he can be subject<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d to the death penalty.It must also be proven that he had intent to kill or that he had recklessdisregard for human life. These same rules would apply to gang members,major narcotic dealers or anyone else engaged in or working in furtheranceof a continuing drug enterprise.Part 2 of our amendment provides additional protection for law enforcementofficers, including Federal, State, FBI, Customs agents, police and sheriffsas well as prosecutors, judges, and correctional officers.This provision is introduced in response to killings that we have seentake place, whether they be in California or New York or, all too often,throughout many parts of our country. Our officers are needlessly, senselessly,with reckless abandonment shot down.The critical need for this legislation is highlighted by the recent assassinationof Edward Byrne, a 22-year old New York City police officer who was gunneddown while guarding the home of a witness in a drug-related prosecution.As Edward Byrne sat in that patrol car at 3:40 in the morning, Mr. President,the killers approached the car, drew their guns, Officer Byrne absolutelyunaware that anyone was there, and shot him in the head. This is what itwas reported that one of those assassins said. He said: ``I could see hisblue eyes.''Mr. President, is anyone here prepared to say that someone who commitsthat kind of a cold-blooded murder as a result of a continuing drug enterpriseto demonstrate to the law authorities that they were immune, that theywere fearless, that that person should not be subject<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ed<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> to the death penalty? That a jury of his peers shouldnot look into that case to examine how it is that someone would take thelife of a 22-year-old police officer in his car?I would suggest to you it is not the place of this body to act as judgeand jury, but to allow the process of justice to go forward and to allowthe jury of 12 <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>of <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>our peers, to make that decision.If there are any mitigating circumstances, then let the defendant offerwhat those proofs must be.Mr. President, I hope we adopt th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>is <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>amendment. It is long overdue. The American peopleare entitled to this protection and they are sick and tired of the protectionsthat are afforded to those wh<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> are killing, maiming, and destroying our neighborhoods,our children, our police officers.

I thank the Chair.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. President, it is no secret in this body thatI oppose capital punishment for a number of reasons, not the least of whichis you cannot correct your mistakes. With the kind of hideous and obscenecrimes which occur that all of us are aware of, whether they are drug relatedor not, each and every one of us wishes to deter those crimes. Some ofus believe capital punishment deters. Others do not. I am one who has checkedthe statistics on deterrence and would state again, as I have before, thatthe States, in general, which have capital punishment have, on the average,higher murder rates than those States without capital punishment.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>So, assuming or presuming that capital punishmentdeterred, one would think that the homicide rate in those States that havecapital punishment would be lower than that in the States without it, butas a matter of fact, that is not so.As a matter of fact, it is also the case that other countries in the WesternWorld, in particular, that do not have capital punishment, have lower homiciderates than those States that do have capital punishment in this country.Many States do have capital punishment. Their homicide rates almost invariablyare higher than that in those countries of the Western World that do nothave capital punishment.But the main reason that I have stated my opposition to capital punishmentis that you cannot correct your mistakes. Over and over again we have convictedwrong people of crimes. We have executed wrong people for crimes.Not too long ago, there is a story that came out of Florida about JosephGreen Brown, somebody who had been on death row for a long period of time.About 15 hours before he was to die one time, as he sat in a death watchcell 30 feet from the electric chair, a Federal judge is<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ues an order staying the execution. He actually wasfit for his burial suit and that tended to have an effect, obviously, onhim.Then it turned out a few years later that he was released because therewas inadequate evidence against him. The court released him on the groundthat he never should have been convicted to begin with. And his lawyerssaid that this case really ought to make people take pause.It is possible that a person who is innocent can be sentenced to deathand very likely could be executed. Refer<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ing to a survey by two people at Tufts Universityand the University of Florida, they said that 343 people have been wrongfullyconvicted of offenses punishable by death in this country this centuryalone, and<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> according to that study<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> 25 were executed.Mistakes are made in this system, and when a mistake is made in a capitalcase, when capital punishment has been inflicted, you cannot correct thatmistake. So that is the reason why other people have opposed capital punishment.I am not going to spend the few minutes we have this afternoon that isallocated to this issue to try to persuade anybody relative to the meritsor demerits of capital punishment. Most of us have made up our minds.What I would like to do is spend a few minutes on this amendment that ispending before us.My friend from New York has talked about drug dealers and how they dealout death. Let me tell you, they do. I live in a town where too many deathsare caused by drugs and related to drugs. But I asked our police commissioneras to who are the victims of these drug-related homicides, whether or not,for the most part, the victims of the drug-related homicides are drug dealersor whether or not they are innocent people, including police officers.Here is what he wrote:[S16MY8-452]{S5921}<ITAG tagnum="21">A survey of drug-related homicides in the city of Detroit indicatesthat the overwhelming majority of these victims are drug t<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>affickers.</ITAG>And so when we face the amendment of our friend from New York, what wehave to ask is who are we trying to protect in this kind of amendment?If, in fact, it is true, as it is in my home town, and I think in mostplaces, that the majority of victims of drug-related homicides are drugdealers, not innocents, not police officers, but drug dealers, then wehave an amendment which ends up protecting drug dealers to the same extentit protects police officers and to the same extent it protects innocentpeople.If you believe that capital punishment deters, despite all the statisticsto the contrary, but if you really believe that, then what are we tryingto deter here, because this amendment is not limited to cases where victimsare police officers or victims are innocent people? This amendment treatsdrug dealers who are victims exactly as it treats police officers who arevictims and exactly as it treats innocent people who are victims.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>It makes no difference who the victim of a drug-relatedhomicide is under this amendment. Capital punishment is an option in bothcases equally. And what kind of society do we have if we have on our booksa law where the punishment that is available in a crime will apply equally<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>wh<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>en the victim of that crime is a drug dealer thanwhen the victim of that crime is an innocent person or a police officer?This amendment makes no difference, and the statistics, again, at leastin my hometown, are that most of the victims of these crimes are drug dealers.So when the sponsors of this amendment talk about drug dealers dealingout death, they could not be more right. I live with too much of that whereI come from. But it is those drug dealers themselves who are, for the mostpart, the victims of the drug-related homicides. Most people where I comefrom do not want to treat a crime whose victim is a drug dealer in thesame way as a crime whose victim is a police officer. This amendment treatsthose crimes in the same way.And so then it raises the question just who exactly are we seeking to protect?This amendment is improperly drafted for many reasons. I am not going to<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>go <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>into them now because I want to save most of ourtime for other speakers as well. This is an amendment that should be debatedat length because, again, it would, for I believe the first or perhapssecond time, place on the books a Federal law, capital punishment. It doesso <ITAG tagnum="80">in an area, where it seems to me, we have a very serious problem,and that is drugs. We ought to try to deter it. That is clear.</ITAG>But the question is whether this amendment is either properly drawn orproperly t<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ar<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>geted to the class of people that we are trying todeter.As a matter of fact, these people who deal out death every day are morelikely to suffer death in the course of their activity than<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>they are by the addition of a new penalty to theFederal books. The likelihood is far, far greater that death will cometo a drug dealer because of his activity than<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>because of the presence of capital punishment asan option on the Federal lawbooks.Yet they persist in that activity anyway despite the present likelihoodor possibility that death will result to them because of their currentactivity.If a deterrent of greater ce<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tainty, which is they will be killed during a drug-relatedactivity, is not sufficient to deter them now, of course the question thenarises, how will a deterrent of lesser cert<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>inty which is the death penalty on a Federal statutebook<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> possibl<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> add anything to what exists?So I happen to agree with my friend from New York in terms of the feelingsabout drug dealers and trying to deter drugs. We both come from communiteswhere there is too much of it, and all of us know the terror which hasbeen visited upon our communities and neigh<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>b<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>orhoods.The question, though, is how do we deter it and how do we punish it? Whenit comes to deterrence, the statistics do not bear out the argument ofthe <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>p<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>roponents of capital punishment. But if you believethey do, then that is a good reason for using your deterrent in the casethat you most want to deter, and that is the case where an innocent personor a police officer or a law enforcement officer is the victim. That isa different situation from where a drug dealer is the victim of anotherdrug dealer.Let us not throw those situations in the same boat. We should treat thosedifferently. This society should treat the killing of a drug dealer byanother drug dealer differently than it treats the killing of a policeofficer by a drug dealer. This amendment does not. For that and many otherreasons, it is flawed.I again think that we should have significant debate on this amendmentbefore this amendment is adopted.Mr. President, I yield the floor.[S16MY8-453]{S5921}D'AMATOMr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished Senatorfrom Texas.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas [Mr. <T4>Gramm</T4>] is recognized.[S16MY8-454]{S5921}GRAMMMr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this amendment. Asyou will recall, the other night we put our armed services into the waragainst drugs. I think we ought to begin by noting that if, in fact, weare going to have a war against drugs, that there is no quicker way toshow we are serious about it than by instituting the death penalty. A deathpenalty for kingpins in the drug industry, who order the killing of peopleor drug dealers, who kill our police officers. It seems to me that parentsof America and the kinfolks of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>m<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>arines, who are going to be put in the position ofdanger, have every right to ask if we are going to put our citizens' soldiersin the position of having to apprehend drug dealers, should we not havea death penalty if one of them is killed by a drug dealer?So I think the question here is how serious are we about this problem?I think we should be very serious. If we are not willing to impose thedea<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>h penalty on kingpin drug dealers, who order themurder of our police officers or our citizens' soldiers, then I submitwe are not very serious about this war, and we are unlikely to win thiswar.I think the truth is that we are going to have to get a lot more seriousbefore we start a war on drugs. It is very easy to spend money. It is veryeasy to commit the military to something, but it is just like throwingthe first blow in a fight. The first blow is always the easiest one, especiallyif you are throwing it. It usually gets a lot tougher after that.I think this is the first time we have had a real test of whether we areserious about this war on drugs. If we are not serious enough to use ourstrongest penalty for people who commit murder in the carrying out of drugtransactions, then really I doubt that we are serious at all. I think weare going to have to get a lot more serious<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>, <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. President, if we are going to win that war. Ithink we need to adopt this amendment today. I think we are going to haveto eliminate this absurd situation where the person selling the drugs isviewed as a criminal, which clearly he is, but the person buying the drugs,an equal partner in the transaction, is viewed as a victim. Clearly thebuyers may be victims, but they too are victimizing society by creatinga market for drugs which creates the smuggling industry, that is preyingon the health and safety and happiness and lives of our children.I do not think this amendment means we are going to win the war, but Ido think it means we are declaring war on the drug industry. I think itis imperative that if we are going to put our military personnel in danger,we have the strongest possible deterrent to protect them. Quite frankly,I think a drug pusher or drug dealer, who murders a police officer oughtto be put to death, and I believe the majority of the American people sharethat conclusion. I am confident, if they had an opportunity, they wouldvote for this amendment. They do not, but we do. I hope that the vast majorityof Senators will vote for this amendment.I yield back the remainder of my time.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?[S16MY8-455]{S5922}D'AMATOMr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.[S16MY8-456]{S5922}DeCONCINIMr. <T4>DeCONCINI. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend fromNew York for offering this amendment and his continued leadership.I say to the Senator from Michigan, we have debated this issue before andthere is nobody who has been a stronger law enforcement Senator. He hasput forth some tough penalties and worked hard in the drug area, but therejust happens to be a dispute as to the necessity and effectiveness of thisparticular legislation.In order to further strengthen our law enforcement efforts against thosewho deal in illegal drugs, I rise to support the amendment offered by theSenator from New York. He has worked tirelessly in the area of strong legislationnot only in this bill but many other bills. In fact, Senator <T4>D'Amato </T4>is a cosponsor with some 73 others of the Antidrug AbuseAct of 198<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>8<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. Because of apprehensions and concerns raised byseveral of our colleagues, we decided it would be best if we did not includethe death penalty in the Antidrug Abuse Act of 1988, not because therewas any softness on the part of those of us who share the same view butbecause we wanted to move forward with law enforcement, with apprehension,at the source countries and with education and rehabilitation and prisonexpansion. But I believe the D'Amato death penalty amendment will providethe kind of deterrent that will truly send a message to the drug traffickersthroughout the world that the United States takes this problem very seriously,as the Senator from Texas just pointed out, and we are ready to deal ina serious manner with this problem. Those who deal in illicit drugs havedemonstrated total disregard for human life. The Jamaican gangs, who callthemselves posses, taken from the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>old <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Wild West movies, have taken control of the cracktrade in the United States today. They are better armed than our police,and it is not unusual to see them with sophisticated weapons, Ak-47's andUzi machin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>eg<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>uns. We have seen time and time again through theAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Agency, the horrendous problem and the amountof death that they have brought, cold-blooded murders in the streets ofour cities. Fortunately, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>my<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> State has not witnessed it yet, but it is not immune,by any means. They are responsible for over 600 murders as a result ofdrugs, and yet we have no death penalty for these ourtrageous bandits.Let me provide an example from Arizona of the brutality and r<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ut<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>hlessness of the drug dealers. Witnesses recentlytestified in Tucson that a 17-year-old Tucson high school student, a verygood student, by the way, was murdered because he owed the alleged killer$2 million and four kilos of cocaine. The 18-year-old suspect in the casetold detectives that he put a wire around the victim's neck and strangledhim while two of his cohorts beat him. To that man, do we want to say,``Well, we will just send you through the regular system so you can beparoled. At 18, you will be back out on the street in 4 or 5 years.''Two years ago, when the Senate was working on the antidrug bill of 1986,the Senate refused to vote directly on the death penalty amendment fordrug traffic<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>k<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ers and instead we did a procedural sidestep. I votedagainst tabling then and if we should have a motion to table today, I urgemy colleagues not to support it.Let us pass this amendment. Let us institute a death penalty. This billhas a lot of carefully drawn procedures. It is not just going to be handedout like tissue paper at celebration. This is a serious matter. Proceduresare set out which require separate hearings, notice of those hearings oramendments to the notice of hearing, and, if a person pleads guilty, therebe a jury empaneled and the jury must consider certain mi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>igating circumstances before they can conclude thata death penalty is warranted. This is after a full jury trial or a pleaof guilty in a case.The American people have consistently demonstrated in opinion polls timeand time again, more than 80 percent of my constituents, they are in favorof the death penalty. Some argue that the death penalty would not be goodbecause there would be mistakes. Unfortunately, there are mistakes andnobody can deny those mistakes, but there is nothing more that can humanlybe done than this bill provides in the procedures to minimize and hopefullyeliminate any mistakes.How far are we going to go? Are we going to permit this kind of death tocontinue and not have a price that is equal to the kind of killings thatare being committed?I thank the Chair and I thank my good friend from New York.[S16MY8-457]{S5922}HATFIELDMr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?[S16MY8-458]{S5922}LEVINMr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield 5 minutes to my friend.[S16MY8-459]{S5922}HATFIELDMr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment andam struck by the irony of debating a death penalty amendment to a militaryspending bill. No one doubts that drug trafficking and drug abuse havebecome this decade's most severe domestic and international social problem.Every aspect to our world is affected by drugs, from the conduct of foreignrelations to the safety of our streets.We all support efforts to combat this crisis, as evidenced by passage ofthe 1986 drug bill and the recent introduction of the Omnibus Anti-DrugAbuse Act of 1988. Our budget resolution was amended, by a unanimous vote,to provide an additional $2.4 billion in budget authority and $1.4 billionin outlays for fiscal year 1989 to address this problem.Mr. President, in spite of these efforts, the drug problem continues toget worse. Our frustration is evident, as is the concern of our citizens.But we must not let our heightened sense of alarm blind us to the realitiesof the issue before us: First, sentence of death has not been proven asuccessful deterrent to violent criminals. We only have to go back in ourhistory to Elizabethan England to find that the greatest source for pickpocketswas at the public hanging for pickpock<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>et<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ing, second, the sentence of death has been handedout in such an arbitrary ma<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ner that it perverts even the most rudimentary notionof justice, and third, the sentence of death is an inappropriate responseto the drug problem or our Nation's malfunctioning criminal justice system.In the short time I have today, I will not address those points. They havebeen touched upon by Senator <T4>Levin, </T4>and others. Needless to say, if the tabling motion fails,I will be prepared to discuss those arguments in some detail and at somelength.Those technical arguments in opposition are secondary to my belief thatthe death penalty is fundamentally inequitable and that it brutalizes thehonored values we hold dear in this society_foremost of which is the valueof human life.Mr. President, we live in a world of constant danger. All of us long tolive our lives in peace. As Americans, we have a rich history as peaceseekers and peacemakers. We long to rid the world and our society of thethreat of war and violence, and to find some way to reduce the tensionbetween the superpowers that keeps this world an impulse away from nuclearholocaust. Certainly it is this desire for peace that led to the signingof the INF <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>reaty, soon to come before this body for debate.But those proclamations for peace are hypocritical. Peace is not possibleabroad when there is violence at home. We will never be at peace with anycountry until we are at peace with ourselves; and we will never be at peacewith ourselves until we cease destroying life and cease enhancing our capabilitiesto exterminate all life. The resurgence of the use of capital punishment is a troubling sign, anda symptom of a deeper problem. This get tough on drugs frenzy is a reflectionof a mean spiritedness growing th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ro<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ughout America. Sparked by the frustration over thegrowth in drug trafficking and drug-related crime and killings, this newmean spirit renounces reconciliation and, instead, embraces confrontation;it responds to violence by engaging in violence; it condones the takingof life as a means of protecting life. During my 21 year tenure of service in this body, I have repeatedly confrontedthis issue. Legislation to establish a Federal death penalty has been pendingin the Senate since the 93d Congress. Each time the issue has been debated,I have carefully listened to the arguments of the proponents, and remainedunconvinced. To me, the death penalty is no different f<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ro<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>m abortion or war or any other governmentally sanctionedform of killing. Whether these acts claim justification in shifting conceptionsof morality, political ideology, or criminal justice, these acts are wrong.  We sit in this Chamber and debate issues involving the sancti<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ty<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of life, and we do so far removed from the battlefields,abortion tables, and execution chambers. We lose ourselves in a maze ofcarefully crafted arguments; and in the process, we distance ourselvesfrom life entirely, deluding ourselves into believing we can understandlife and human behavior through an elaborate process of intellectualizationand abstract debate. Well, Mr. President, we cannot. In the case of the death penalty, this tendency to insulate ourselves fromthe implications of our decisions <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>is<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> readily apparent. The antiseptic term ``capitalpunishment'' is substituted from the term ``public execution'' or ``State-sanctionedkilling.'' The executions themselves are conducted in cloak-and-daggersecrecy, with elaborate phone hookups to the Governor and last-second courtappeals providing the impression that the Government is about to do somethingthat it would p<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>re<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>fer not to do. I was Governor of Oregon two decadesago and participated in the process<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>_<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the horrible memory of that experience remains freshto this very day. The inescapable conclusion from that experience is that killing a criminalwho k<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>il<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>led an innocent person serves only to perpetuatea circle of violence and hate and performs no function worthy of civilizedgovernment. Instead of embarking upon the high road which sustains life,the dea<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>th<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> penalty drags along the low road of venge<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>an<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ce, of eye for an eye re<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ribution, or cold bloodletting and it cheapens thesancti<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ty<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of life. Then<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> as now, Mr. President, I believe the death penaltyto be immoral, unconstitutional, and outside the legitimate authority ofgovernment and I urge my colleagues to support the motion to table theamendment. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I thank the Senator from Michigan.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in support ofthe first and second degree amendments offered by Senators D'<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Amato <CODE-213>1</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>and <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Wilson <CODE-213>1</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>which authorize the death penalty for drug-relatedmurder and establishes constitutional procedures for the imposition ofthe death penalty for this offense. I commend them for offering this bill.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>As we have witnessed over the past few years, drugshave become a big business. Drug trafficking and violent crime_especiallymurder_are often intertwined. These amendments would provide for the impositionof the death penalty against the drug kingpin as well as any other individualin the drug organization who commits murder. As well, these amendmentswould provide for the death penalty for a person who violates the controlledsubstances laws and kills a Federal, State or local law enforcement officer.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>P<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eople involved in the drug business often have noregard for human life and kill to further their interest. It is intolerablethat in our own country, law enforcement officers and other innocent peoplehave become victims of these violent killers. The death penalty for theseoffenses is both an appropriate and necessary penalty.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Someone said that it is not a deterrent. From theexperience I have had in practicing law and as a judge, trial judge, itis a deterrent, a strong deterrent.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>se<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> amendments comport with the constitutional requirementsthat have been outlined by the Supreme Court. These amendments set up abifurcated process which the factfinder must follow when determining whethera sentence of death is justified. This process consists of a hearing todetermine the guilt or innocence of the defendant, and a second hearingto determine whether to impose the death penalty on a guilty defendant.As my colleagues are aware, I have strongly supported the death penaltyfor many years. On the first day of this Congress, I introduced S. 277which establishes constitutional procedures for the imposition of the deathpenalty for those Federal crimes for which this penalty is currently authorizedsuch as murder, treason, and espionage. Further my bill authorizes thedeath penalty for an attempted assassination of the President as well asmurder committed by a Federal prisoner while serving a life sentence. LastCongress, the Judiciary Committee reported a bill similar to S. 277. Inthe 98th Congress, a similar bill passed the Senate by a vote of 63 to32. Unfortunately in the year and a half since I introduced S. 277, therehas been no action on this bill or the seven other death penalty billscurrently pending in the Judic<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ary Committee.These amendments that are before us today are similar to a provision thatwas approved by the House and included in the omnibus drug bill of 1986.However, as my colleagues will remember, the Senate did not approve thatprovision. I believe that it is appropriate to act on this issue now. Althoughthese amendments are not as broad as the bill that I introduced, it isa step toward the full implementation of our death penalty laws. I stronglyurge my colleagues to support these death penalty amendments and opposethe motion to table.I yield the floor, Mr. President.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are talking about scumbags who exploit the weakness of theweak in our society, who are after our children and destroying them. Weare talking about deterrence of people like that.I know one thing: if the death penalty becomes the law in these particularareas, it is going to be a terrific deterrence to those who would go aboutexploiting the weakness of our youth and of others in our society who areweak, who are likely to partake of the illegal influences that they bringto them.We are talking about heinous crime.

In all honesty, capital punishmentis society's ultimate recognition of the sanctity of human life.Mr. President, capital punishment is our society's ultimate recognitionof the sanctity of human life. The Declaration of Independence clarifiedthat governments are instituted to protect inalienable rights to life andliberty. Capital punishment is our Government's ultimate sanction and maybe the only way to make some he<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>in<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ous crimes unthinkable. As Walter Berns, a leadingstudent on this matter, has observed, criminal law makes a moral statementwhen it punishes. Ironically, it <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>is<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> only through application of the sanction of capitalpunishment that civilized society is able to express the deep reverencethat it places upon human life.[S16MY8-466]{S5924}deterrence<ITAG tagnum="89">deterrence</ITAG>It is important, and I believe essential, to keep in mind that the Anglo-Americanlegal system is based upon the belief in the sanctity, the worth, and thevalue of one human life. Thus, if the death penalty deters merely one would-bemurderer_let alone more than one_and saves but one innocent potential victim,then it is morally and legally justified.While there is much debate as to whether the death penalty deters murder,I am in agreement with those studies which conclude that the death penaltydoes operate as an effective deterrent for some crimes involving premeditationand calculation, such as murder for hire.In addition, great weight must be placed on the experience of the law enforcementofficials_particularly those who deal frequently with murderers and potentialmurderers. The vast majority of these officials, based on their professionalexperience, continue to favor the retention of the death penalty<ITAG tagnum="80">as a deterrent to violent crime. Moreover, we should keep in mindthat those who are, in fact, deterred by the threat of the death pena<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>lt<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>y and do not commit <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>mu<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rder are never included in statistical data. In thewords of the prominent author and criminologist, Charles E.

The newspaper USA Today,in a l<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ter report, carried the results of a national pollwhich showed that 75 percent of all adult Americans, three-fourths of thegeneral population over 21 years of age, agreed with the death penalty.In 1984, 36 States had capital punishment statutes. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Today in 1987, 38 States have capital punishmentstatutes. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Clearly, the majority of Americans and their electedrepresentative are behind the application of capital punishment for thosewho are convicted of grievous capital offenses.[S16MY8-467]{S5924}constituti<ITAG tagnum="89">constitutionality</ITAG>The need to establish a constitutional procedure for the imposition ofthe death penalty is required by a series of Supreme Court cases startingwith Furman versus. Georgia in 1972. It is important to note that thesecases never held that the death penalty itself is unconsitutional; theymerely found that the penalty was not accompanied by sufficient constitutionalsafeguards. These decisions require legislative guid<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>an<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ce before the penalty can be imposed. These amendmentsmeet the challenge of Furman of guided discre<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ion b<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>as<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ed on rational criteria.The key cases relating to the constitutionality of the death penalty are<T3>Gregg </T3>v. <T3>Georgia,</T3> 428 U.S. 153 (1976), and <T3>Coker </T3>v.<T3> Georgia,</T3> 433 U.S. 584 (1978). Under both cases, a punishmentwill be deemed excessive and thus unconstitutional if it ``first, makesno measurable contribution to acceptable goals of punishment and henceis nothing more than the purposeless and needless imposition<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="80">of pain and suffering; or seocnd, is grossly out of proportion tothe severity of the crime.'' </ITAG><T3><CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Co<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ker </T3>v. <T3>Georgia, </T3>433 U.S. 584, 5<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>92<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. Attention must be paid, according to the decision,to ``history, precedent, legislative attitudes, and the response of juriesreflected in their sentencing decisions<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> . . .<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>'' It is worth noting that Justice Powell, in hisCoker dissent, offers a test for constitutionality which centers on society's``evolving standards of decency, particularly legislative enactments andthe responses of the juries in capital cases.'' <T3><CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Co<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ker</T3> v. <T3>Georgia, </T3>at 6<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>03<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. What this means is that the nature of the act itselfshould be taken into account and measured against the prevailing normsof society. The key seems to be proportionality. The Greg court did notspecifically hold that the death penalty for armed robbery was unconstitutional,but it did assert that excessive or disproportionate penalties violatedbasic constitutional standards. Thus, capital punishment imposed for adrug-related murder under amendment No<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. 2070 and 2071 are within the bounds of constitutionalpermissibility, if it meets the societal norm standard and does not offen<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the proportionality principle.[S16MY8-468]{S5924}possibilit<ITAG tagnum="89">possibility of error </ITAG>These amendments establish every conceivable procedure to minimize thechance of error. Admittedly, any human institution carries with it thepossibility of error. Yet the danger of miscarriage of justice must beweighed against the far greater evils for which the death penalty aimsto provide protective remedies. In this case, the procedures outlined inthese amendments employs a system that reduces to the minimum the possibilityof error; now we need the self-confidence to rely on that system. The protectionto society afforded by the death penalty warrants our efforts to proceed.[S16MY8-469]{S5924}felony mur<ITAG tagnum="89">felony murder and capital punishment</ITAG>Critics of the death penalty have erroneously asserted that the felonymurder rule is a narrow and highly restrictive rule which eliminates, amongother things, any proximate causation from actions which directly resultsin the murder of someone who dies from an act which is linked to the deathby a causal chain. <T3>Edmund </T3>v<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213><T3>Florida, </T3>458 U.S. 782 (1981), sustained the felony murder rule.The Edmund court fo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>cu<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>sed on the element that the defendant intended thatlethal force be used in the commission of the capital offense. The testlaid down by opinion for felony murder is that the defendant intended ``thata killing take place or that lethal force'' would be employed. In otherwor<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s, for a felony murder conviction, it must be proved<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>beyond <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended tokill the victim, that the defendant intended that the victim be killed,or that the defendant intended the lethal force used in the commissionof the offense would result in a homicide. Scienter, or knowledge, is anessential element in applying these tests. Moreover, according to prevailingcriminal law in most state jurisdictions, if the defendant action was soreckless, wanton, and willful, being completely indifferent to value ofhuman life, that also would be enough to trigger a first degree murderconviction. [S16MY8-470]{S5925}Aggravatin<ITAG tagnum="89">Aggravating offenses </ITAG>Those representing the other side of this issue often misinterpret thepost-conviction, resentencing procedure in capital offense cases popularlycalled aggravation and mitigation. The Supreme Court has required, as aresult of the decision in <T3>Lockett </T3>v<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213><T3>Ohio, </T3>43<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>8<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> U.S. 586 (1977), a balancing of aggravating andmitigating factors to determine whether or not a convicted defendant shouldbe sentenced to death. This means only relevant aggravating and mitigatingfactors relating to the defendant's character, past history, prior bad<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ac<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ts, and the nature of the crime in question. TheLockett court focused on ``any aspect of a defendant's character or recordand any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant offers asa basis for a sentence less than <ITAG tagnum="80">death.'' (</ITAG><T3>Lockett </T3>v. <T3>Ohio, </T3>at 604). The opponents of the death penalty misconstruethe latter and oppose the former. What they are doing is to emphasize mitigationat the expense of aggravation. But the Supreme Court has declared thatthe entire nature of the crime and the criminal be taken into account.Aggravating circumstances, Mr. President, are meant to be exactly that.The <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Co<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>urt has listed in prior cases appropriate factorsof aggravation and mitigation. <T3>McGautha </T3>v. <T3>California, </T3><CODE-213>5</CODE-213>402<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> U.S. 183 (1971). If a statute provides for specifiedmitigating factors, and others are not relevant, then they do not apply.On first degree murder convictions, defendants have the burden of demonstratingwhy they should not be subject to the ultimate sanction. And justly so,if civilized society is going to continue to be civilized. Manufacturingand distributing narcotics, particularly in large amounts, is an activitythat can be lethal and it is foreseeable.[S16MY8-471]{S5925}conclusion<ITAG tagnum="89">conclusion</ITAG>In conclusion, Mr. President, the death penalty without a doubt reflectsthe majority view of the American people. It is designed, of course, tobe applied by the courts within the parameters of due process and fundamentalfairness.Capital punishment shows that our society is committed to upholding itsvalues. The death penalty indicates the moral tone of the system for whichit is designed. It reflects, most of all, a sense of justice in rightingthe terrible wrongs inflicted upon victims and their survivors, and thewrongs inflicted upon society itself.Capital punishment is a regrettable necessity. It is morally and philosophicallydefensible. The legendary ancient <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Gr<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eek philosopher, Socrates, himself subject to capitalpunishment, nonetheless defended it in one of the great Platonic dialo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>gs<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>on<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>eve <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>of his execution_the Crito. The interests of the<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tate and the interests of society, Socrates argued,mus<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> take precedence_<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>in<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> cases where the individual has offended the fundamentalnorms of society.Heinous crimes, Mr. President, deserve the ultimate sanction.

Mr. President, an article appearingin the February 19 edition of the Los Angeles Times recounted the slayingof a San Diego policeman by a drug-crazed maniac who shot the officer ina drug-induced moment of panic. Prior to the shooting, the killer had toldan acquaint<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>an<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ce, ``I wouldn't hesitate to shoot a cop.''<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. President, it is time for the Congress of theUnited States to take action to change the attitude. Perhaps if drug dealersand their henchmen knew that the consequences of killing a law enforcementofficer would be death, they would think twice before squeezing the trigger.The amendment offer<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ed<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> today by the Senator from New York will go a longway toward changing this arrogant attitude about the men and women whoput their lives on the line every day to uphold the laws against drugsthat the Congress and our State legislature<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> enact.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>A February 29 New York Times article discussed theassassination-style shooting of 22-year<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>old rookie officer Edward Byrne. He was gunned downwhile sitting in his radio car guarding the home of a witness in a narcoticstrial who had complained to the police about crack sales in his neighborhood.Ten thousand peace officers attended Eddie Byrne's funeral to show theirresolve to fight back against the drug dealers and pushers who threatentheir lives on a daily basis.In yet another incident, two special agents of the U.S. Drug EnforcementAdministration_George Montoya and Paul Seema_were shot to death by drugtraffickers. These were not accidential slayings nor did they occur inthe heat of passion. They were cold blooded, pre-meditated murders by membersof a heroin crime cartel in the Far East. These murders were not just attackson these two men_they were attacks on the Federal justice system_indeed<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>an<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> attack on society itself. It is time to send a clearmessage to the drug trade that these attacks will no longer be tolerated.The amendment we consider today would impose the death penalty on drugkingpins and their hitmen when they intentionally, or with reckless disregardfor human life, kill or participate in the killing of any person. Thisprovision applies to those engaged in a continuing criminal enterprisein violation of the ``Drug Kingpin'' statute involving five or more personsand a series of three or more crimes.The amendment also provides for the death penalty for anyone who, in thecourse of engaging in an ongoing organized drug crime, intentionally killsa Federal, State, or local law enforcement officer while he is acting inthe line of duty.The measure has been carefully crafted to withstand constitutional scrutinyunder recent Supreme Court rulings on capital punishment, specificallyEnmund versus Florida, 1982 and Tison versus Arizona, 1987. In those cases,the high Court held that for the death penalty to be applied, the killermust have had specific intent to kill, or else must have acted with recklessindifference to human life, and he must have been a substantial participantin the activity leading to the killing.Procedural safeguards are also built into the amendment. Specific mitigatingand aggravating factors would be considered and the defendant would receiveadvance notice of the Government's intention to seek the death penalty.The dea<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>th<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> penalty could only be imposed upon a unanimous voteof the jury.Yesterday, the Nation joined together to remember the 155 peace officerswho were killed in the line of duty last year. The best way to honor thesefallen heros is to enact legislation that would severely punish those whokill those charged with upholding and enforcing our laws. I intend to votefor this amendment to honor the memory of those who have fallen in thewar against drugs, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.Mr. President, I commend, as did the Senator from Utah, Senator <T4>D'Amato, </T4>Senator <T4>DeConcini, </T4>and Senator <T4>Wilson. </T4>When I discovered how strong the sentiment on this issue is, I joined them,to try to make certain this bill would contain this kind of provision.Yesterday, the Nation joined to remember 155 peace officers who were killedin the line of duty last year. In my opinion, the best way to honor thememory of those people who have given their lives for this Nation wouldbe to severely punish those who kill anyone in violation of our laws. This is a very narrow amendment before us now, but I hope that the Senatewill vote to reject a motion to table and will put this issue before us,so that we can deal with it appropriately. [S16MY8-474]{S5926}D'AMATOMr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, before we conclude this debate, let me saythat it is obvious that the drug dealers and drug czars are absolutelyfearless, when they can shoot down a police officer and have him executedfor no other reason<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>than that they want to demonstrate what they cando. I suggest that the time for the death penalty is long overdue. Last Thursday, there was a headline in one of the local newspapers in NewYork: ``Sleeping Woman Shot in Drug Turf Gun Battle.'' She is now on arespirator. At 1 o'clock in the morning, 10 men came and shot up the buildingshe was sleeping in and killed her. There is a reckless indifference tohuman life. I suggest that the death penalty is appropriate. I also suggest, as it relates to those who would kill someone in a drugconspiracy, that the only way you will get them to be able to talk is whenyou can hang that threat of the death penalty over their head. Then wewill get the kind of cooperation we need. Mr. President, the safeguards as they relate to constitutionality and asthey relate to enforcement are provided for in this bill. If we are seriousabout fighting the drug epidemic and those posses and those gangs thatare marauding, let us put a little fear in them instead of having the citizensand the police officers the ones who are fearful.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? [S16MY8-475]{S5926}KENNEDYMr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Michigan yield? [S16MY8-476]{S5926}LEVINMr. LEVIN. I yield whatever time the Senator needs, or whatever time Ihave remaining. How much time remains? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes. [S16MY8-477]{S5926}LEVINMr. LEVIN. I yield 5 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized for5 minutes. [S16MY8-478]{S5926}KENNEDYMr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose this death penalty amendment. Thisis the wrong amendment at the wrong time on the wrong bill. Capital punishmentis wrong as a matter of principle, it is wrong as a matter of public policy,and it is wrong to attempt to tie this highly contentious and controvers<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ia<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>l issue to the Defense authorization bill_especiallywhen it is delaying final action on the bill and on the Senate's considerationof the INF Treaty. I oppose the death penalty. The U.S. Government ought not to be in thebusiness of taking lives. In my view, the death penalty is cruel and unusualpunishment, and I hope that some day the Supreme Court will reach the sameconclusion and declare it unconstitutional. The death penalty is not justified as a matter of public policy, becausethere is no convincing evidence that capital punishment has any deterrenteffect on crime. No criminal justice system_no matter how extensive itsprocedural protections_can eliminate the possibility that an innocent personwill be put to death. No criminal justice system can eliminate the substantialrisk that racial discrimination and other arbitrary and unconscionablefactors will play a role in determining who shall live and who shall die.Any marginal deterrent effect that the death penalty may have is clearlyoutweighed by the risk of mistake and the danger of prejudice. Every <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>M<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ember of the Senate wants to do something about violentcrime and drugs. But the death penalty is not the answer. It is not goingto reduce violent crime or stem the tidal wave of illegal drugs washingup on our shores. There will be other opportunities and more appropriate legislation forthe Senate to consider the death penalty. We ought not to tie up the Senatedebating this amendment now. It does not belong on the Defense authorizationbill, and the President and the American people are waiting for us to beginconsideration of the INF Treaty. I urge my colleagues_whether they support or oppose capital punishment_tovote to table the pending amendment, so that we can move on expeditiouslyto final passage of the defense bill, and complete action on the INF Treatybefore the Moscow summit. If the motion to table fails, I will be prepared to discuss the amendmentat greater length. But I hope that the outcome of this vote will make thatcourse unnecessary. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? [S16MY8-479]{S5926}LEVINMr. LEVIN. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Illinois. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois [Mr. <T4>Simon</T4>] is recognized for 3 minutes. [S16MY8-480]{S5926}SIMONMr. SIMON. Mr. President, I hope, for two reasons, that this amendmentwill be rejected. First is a procedural reason. The reality is that if we are talking aboutimposing the death penalty, we ought to be looking at this very, very carefully.I do not think there is any question that if the death penalty goes onhere, there is going to be extensive debate on that, as there should be.We should not be taking the lives of people just all of a sudden becausesomeone comes up with an amendment.The second reason goes to the substance of this issue. I recognize thepolitical popularity of the death penalty, but I also know one simple truth,and that simple truth is this: The only people who get the death penaltyare the children of the poor. If you have enough money to hire the bestattorneys, you do not get the death penalty in this country. It is justpoor people who get the death penalty. I do not think we ought to havethis kind of penalty, a penalty of that severity, simply for the childrenof the poor, and I would hope that we would approach this with great caution.Finally, I would add that this is one penalty where, if someone is innocent,there is no possible way to compensate for what has been done.I recall some years ago when the death penalty was under considerationbefore the Illinois General Assembly. A man was about to be executed, Ibelieve in the State of the Presiding Officer_I am not absolutely certainof that_but about that time, someone in Carroll County volunteered thathe had been guilty of the crime. We came very near to executing an innocentperson.Unfortunately, our history has a number of instances where innocent personshave been executed.I think this is not the way to go, and I hope with all due respect to myfriend from New York that this amendment will be rejected.I yield back the remainder of the time allotted to me to the Senator fromMichigan.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. <T4>Conrad</T4>). Who yields time?[S16MY8-481]{S5926}D'AMATOMr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, to reiterate, I do not believe that this amendmentis a panacea. I am not suggesting it is going to stop drug trafficking.I am going to say I think it will have a measured impact in terms of thedrug dealers who fear no one. The only thin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>they fear is death itself, and let them be on theend of that fear for a change. There are proper constitutional safeguards,I believe, in this bill built in to meet all of those requirements underthe Supreme Court decision.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.[S16MY8-482]{S5926}TRIBLEMr. TRIBLE. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment. It will addanother weapon to our antidrug arsenal by imposing the death penalty forkillings that occur during drug-related crimes. Last week, we made a decision to involve the Armed Forces more heavilyin drug interdiction. That was a necessary step, and it will enhance ourefforts. But improving our interdiction efforts is only one step. We mustalso have penalties that adequately punish and deter. This amendment will provide a Federal death penalty for: Drug kingpins who order the killing of someone; The person who actually commits the killing; Anyone who demonstrates a ``reckless indifference for human life'' whokills or participates substantially in the killing of someone in connectionwith a continuing criminal drug enterprise; Anyone who demonstrates a ``reckless indifference for human life'' whokills or participates substantially in the killing of a law enforcementofficer in connection with a drug transaction such as a policeman is shotduring a shootout; and Anyone involved in a drug transaction who kills a law enforcement officer.Drug crimes are dangerous and deadly. Those who traffic in illicit drugsprey on our young people. They pose a clear and present danger to our Nation'slaw enforcement officers and, indeed, to the fabric of our society.Yesterday in the Nation's Capital, the Fraternal Order of Police held itsannual memorial service for law enforcement officers killed in the lineof duty. In 1987 alone, 155 police men and women were killed. Our policeare under assault, and they are especially vulnerable to violent, well-armeddrug runners.These drug kingpins contribute most to the widespread availability of narcotics.They threaten our policemen and our citizens. They are willing to killanyone who gets in the way of their drug-pedaling and profits. They imposeunacceptable risks on this country. It's time our society imposed a comparablepenalty on them.Quite simply, they deserve the toughest punishment that the Governmentcan impose.This amendment will provide a valuable tool for the Nation's prosecutors.It will afford our police and our children and all of our citizens a measureof protection. Moreover, it will send a powerful signal that America willno longer tolerate the damage that drugs inflict upon our children, ourfamilies, our homes, and our schools.I urge that the Senate pass this measure decisively and vote against themotion to table.[S16MY8-483]{S5927}HELMSMr. HELMS. Mr. President, there is supposedly a war against drug<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> ongoing in this country.

Nor can drug czars be dissuaded by fines or light sentences.They laugh at such measures. What's a million dollars to a billionairedrug dealer? We need to place the fear of capital punishment in front ofthe drug czar.The present law does provide the weapon of life sentences in the fightagainst drug czars. But how many life sentences are acutally served? Notmany, because the criminal gets out on parole. We need the ultimate weaponin this war on drugs: the threat of the death penalty.Mr. President, this amendment gives the jury the option of imposing thedeath penalty in two specific cases. First, it applies when one who isengaged in a continuing criminal enterprise inte<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ntiona<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>lly or recklessly causes the death of another. Second,it<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>applies when a law enforcement offic<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>r is killed by one who is <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>en<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>gage<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> in a continuing criminal enterprise.We have countless <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nstances where judges, law enforcement officers,and others have been kil<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ed at th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> hands of drug czars.These murders are utterly despicable acts_they are deliberate and calculated.This amendment sends a st<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ong signal to the drug czars that we will not sitby and allow them to murder in cold blood.Mr. President, although the infliction of the dealth penalty is a personaltragedy for the convicted criminal, it is necessary in a civilized societyin the interest of just punishment, deterrence of others, and protectionto society from the offender himself. Without capital punishment for suchheinous murders, the Government fails in its primary duty to administerjustice, and in the process, it endangers all law-abiding citizens.Perpetrators of these and other tra<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>itionally capital crimes wilfully risk the forfeitureof their lives. They have shown themsel<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>v<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>es unfit_through their own deli<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>b<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>erate and voluntary conduct_to participate in civilizedsociety becaused they have, in effect, declared war on that society. Undersuch circumstances, the death penalty is proportionat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> to the crime, it fits the crime, and no other punishmentwould really do justice.Mr. President, in considering the justice of the death penalty, we mustno<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> overlook the fact that the guilty act is alwaysa voluntary act. Under traditional Anglo-American law on this subject,an essential element in every capital crime is that <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>it <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>be a free act of will. The offender was free to choosenot to commit the crime.Opponents of the death penalty, however, wou<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ld<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> have us believe that capital c<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>imes are mostly a product of one's background, upbringing,environment, childhoo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, and so forth. In their op<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nion, people who commit capital crimes are not properlyeducated or conditioned_or ``socialized'' as they say. As a result, itis really a neglectful society, not the offender himself, who is responsiblefor capital crimes. Naturally, given such a view, to inflict the deathpenalty becomes ``cruel and unusual punishment'' in every case.This view represents a profound misunderstanding of human nature. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t assumes that we do not act, in the most seriousmatters, with free will and freedom of action. It implies that we are notresponsible for what we do. Indeed, it reduces the meaning of human actionto a level little better than that of animals. Like them, we supposedlychew our cuds, do what comes naturally, and die_and that is all there is.Fortunately, Mr. President, this view of human nature, while it may beheld by some psychologists, penologists, and aca<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>emics, is rejected out of hand by the overwhelmingmajority of Americans. They know, from ordinary experience that they cancontrol whether or not they murder someone else, and they know that virtuallyeveryone can do so as well. That is wh<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> they strongly support the death penalty and whythey expect Government to use it without delay for heinous crimes suchas those covered by this amendment.Mr. Pres<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>id<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ent, in addition to serving justice, capital punishmentis a strong deterrent. It simply stands to reason that in societies wherethere is a swift and sure application of the death penalty for heinouscrimes, there will be less heinous crimes. The whole theor<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of deterrence is based upon the certainty, and theseverity of punishment.Deterrence has two main objectives_general and specific. General deterrenceis community centered. Its underlying rationale is to protect the well-beingof society. All potential wrongdoers are put on notice by the inflictionof punishment through the instrumentality of the courts that serious offenseswill earn a serious penalty. General deterrence constitutes both a presentwarning and a future threat to all would-be offenders that criminal activitywill definitely incur some definite penalty.Specific deterrence i<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> aimed at a specific wrongdoer. It simply means thatthe convicted murderer who receives the death penalty, will by the veryact of execution be prevented from murdering again. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t is important to keep in mind that <ITAG tagnum="80">the Anglo-American legal system is based upon the belief in the sanctity,the worth, and the value of one human life. Thus, if the death penaltydeters merely one would-be murderer, and saves but one innocent potentialvictim, then it is morally and legally justified. </ITAG>Mr. President, on the overall issue of the morality and wisdom of capitalpunishment in our time, th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ere<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> has been much debate by various religious groups.Some religious spokesmen have recently even condemned capital punishmentas the same kind of violation of the human person as abortion. Nothing, Mr. President, could be further from the truth. As I have saidon many occasions_to show the fundamental distinction between capital punishmentand abortion_I favor capital punishment for all unborn babies who havecommitted capital crimes. The crucial point here <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>is<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> that unborn children are perfectly innocent of anycrime, having committed no voluntary act whatsoever_much less a culpableone. On the other hand, capital punishment is only imposed when an offenderhas committed the most egregious crimes against innocent human life. Reserved in this way as the ultimate punishment for ultimate crimes, thedeath penalty does not violate our religious and cultural value of protectingin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ocent human life. Indeed, it actually vindicatesthis value by applying the ultimate sanction for unconscionable attackson innocent citizens. Traditionally, both Judaism and Christianity have affirmed the authorityof the state to use capital punishment for heinous crimes. Without belaboringthis point, I will simply add three short items. First, the Mosaic codementions murder, kidnaping, witchcraft, idolatry, sodomy, adultery, incest,blasphemy, and several other offenses as punishable by death. Second, St.Paul said the ruler ``beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the ministerof God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.'' (Romans13:4). And third, St. Thomas Aquinas made this classic defense of the deathpenalty:[S16MY8-484]{S5928}<ITAG tagnum="21">If a man is a danger to the community and corrupts it through somesin or other, it is right and just that he should be put to death in orderto safeguard the common good. * * * As God himself does, so should humanjustice put to death those who are a danger to others and reserve punishmentfor those who do not seriously endanger others. (Summa Theologica, II-II,64. art. 2.)</ITAG>Mr. President, there are numerous Federal statutes currently on the booksthat provide for a sentence of death. However, the fact is that the deathpenalty cannot be imposed <ITAG tagnum="80">for Federal crimes because we have failed to enact constitutionalprocedures for imposing such a sentence.</ITAG>In 1972, the Supreme Court, in the case of Furman versus Georgia, ruledthat the existing death penalty statutes were unconstitutional becausethe jury was allowed to use its unfettered discretion in determining whethera sentence of death should <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>be imposed. That ruling rendered the Federal death<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>pe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>na<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>lty inoperative.Subsequently, in a series of landmark decisions handed down in 1976, theSupreme Court determined that the death penalty was const<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>it<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>utional when imposed under certain procedures specificallydesigned to guard against the jury using it<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> unfettered discretion.Other decisions have clarified the circumstances under which the deathpenalty may be imposed. Since these decisions<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> efforts have also been underway in the Senate toset up the necessary procedures for the imposition of the death penaltyin accordance with the Supreme Court's rulings.This amendment complies with the constitutional requirements outlined bythe Supreme Court. This amendment establishes the appr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>op<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>riate procedures for the imposition of the deathpenalty in the specific cases addressed by this amendment.Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment in order thato<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>r society may once again have a measured responseand justified deterrence for these heinous crimes.The Senator from Michigan controls 2 minutes and 49 seconds. Who yields time? [S16MY8-485]{S5928}LEVINMr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The remainder of the time is yielded back by theSenator from Michigan. All time for the debate has expired. The Republican leader. [S16MY8-486]{S5928}DOLEMr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. [S16MY8-487]{S5928}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for thequorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. [S16MY8-488]{S5928}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wonder if any of those Senator who are opposedto the death penalty wish to move to table the amendment. The silence is deafening. Do they not wish to table the amendment? If the amendment is not tabled,under the agreement, it comes back before the Senate tomorrow at 10 a.m.or prior thereto if all other amendments on the list have been called upand disposed of. Am I correct? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. [S16MY8-489]{S5928}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support the death penalty. I am going to moveto table the amendment because that is what we agreed, that we would havea tabling motion. All Senators may wish to vote for or against the amendment,but that was the agreement. Senators have come to the floor expecting tovote on the tabling of the amendment, as was announced. And if the amendmentis not tabled, then it will go away until 10 o'clock tomorrow, providedthere are other amendments that keep the Senate busy until that time. Let me give those who were so adamantly opposed to the death penalty theopportunity to move to table the amendment. I do not want to take the flooraway from anyone. I do not want to be in anyone's way. Because I am supportiveof the death penalty, there would be no reason for me to move to tablethis amendment, other than to have the Senate do what it said it woulddo, and that is vote on the motion to table the amendment today at 4 p.m.And it is 13 minutes after 4. [S16MY8-490]{S5928}DOLEMr. DOLE. Will the majority leader yield for a question? [S16MY8-491]{S5928}BYRDMr. BYRD. Yes. [S16MY8-492]{S5928}DOLEMr. DOLE. I do not know what the parliamentarian may have decided or theChair may have decided. It was my understanding, if there was no motionto table made, then we have a question. Maybe that has been resolved. But I agree with the majority leader. I wish some of those who were opposedto this death penalty amendment would stand up and move to table this amendment.Great speeches have been made on the Senator floor. But, if that does not happen, then I think we do owe it to our colleagueswho are here_and some have been here since even before 4 o'clock_waitingto vote. It is my understanding that if the motion to table carries, then that isthe end of this amendment. If not, and we finish at some reasonable time,say 6, 6:30, we would come back for further debate on the amendment forawhile this evening, in any event, and then we would have to figure outsomething to do between now and 10 o'clock. [S16MY8-493]{S5928}BYRDMr. BYRD. If the hour of 10 o'clock arrives and the amendment has not beentabled in the meantime, then it comes back before the Senate. I do thinkthe Senate, having agreed to the order that the amendment would be calledup at 3 o'clock and that there would be 1 hour of debate on it and thenthere would be a tabling motion and vote at 4 o'clock, I believe the Senatehas an obligation to proceed and uphold the order.So if no Senator who is opposed to the death penalty wishes to move totable the death penalty amendment, then I think some of us, some one amongus who supports the dea<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>th<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> penalty, should move to table it and vote againsttabling the amendment. I will do that if no one who is opposed to the deathpenalty does it. I will give those Senators another opportunity to makethe motion.[S16MY8-494]{S5928}FOWLERMr. FOWLER. May I address the majority leader for a procedural question.Mr. President, I have not been involved in this issue, so I am reluctantto rise, but I think it might be helpful to those of us who are here tovote, given the present quandary. If there is no motion offered, is itour understanding that we would not<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> under any circumstance, revisit this amendment until10 o'clock tomorrow morning; is that correct, if no motion were offeredat this time?[S16MY8-495]{S5928}BYRDMr. BYRD. If no motion were offered, then the matter would come back beforethe Senate tomorrow morning no later than tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock.[S16MY8-496]{S5928}FOWLERMr. FOWLER. But not before?[S16MY8-497]{S5929}BYRDMr. BYRD. It could be before. In the event that no other Senators <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>wis<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>hed to call up any remaining amendments on this listbefore the Senate, then, under the order, the death penalty amendment wouldbe back before the Senate.[S16MY8-498]{S5929}FOWLERMr. FOWLER. And if a motion to table was offered but that motion f<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>iled, when would the Senate then revisit the D'Amatoamendment?[S16MY8-499]{S5929}BYRDMr. BYRD. At no later than tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.[S16MY8-500]{S5929}FOWLERMr. FOWLER. So, in all likelihood, regardless of whether or not a motionto table was offered, the Senate would not revis<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>it<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> this issue until 10 o'clock tomorrow morning underthe existing order. If that is the case, may I ask the majority leaderto consider vitiating the order and proceeding with business, since wewould not, in all likelihood, get to the D'Amato amendment again until10 o'clock tomorrow morning.[S16MY8-501]{S5929}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, any Senator who wishes to ask unanimous consentthat the order be vitiated may do so and it would be within his rights.If the Senate wished to vitiate the order, then there would be no voteon the motion to table today. But unless that is done, I think if we aregoing to enter into agreements around here, we ought to keep them.The Senator from New York called up his amendment on Friday and there wasa desperate effort here on the part of all of us to get on with actionon that bill. One way of moving the bill forward at that time was to agreeto set the amendment aside by the Sen<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tor from New York, Mr. <T4>D'Amato,</T4> until 3 p.m. today and there would be 1 hour of debateon the tabling motion and that vote would occur at 4 o'clock today. Ifthe tabling motion failed, then the amendment would be again set asideuntil the hour of 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, at which time the finalvote is to occur, unless prior to that time all other amendments have beendisposed of or Senators who wanted to call up their amendments had calledthem up, whichever one was the earlier of the two times, then that wasthe time which would govern the resumption of debate on the D'Amato amendment.I do not think we should have entered into the order on Friday, puttingthe Senator's amendment aside. That was one way of getting it aside. Wew<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>re all for that until 3 o'clock Monday so we couldgo ahead with other amendments. It was agreed that we would have a tablingmotion at 4 o'clock today.Now comes 4 o'clock and those who are within their rights and for goodreasons in their own minds oppose the death penalty amendment, now theydo not want to come forward to move to table the death penalty amendment.So, in order that the order be carried out in good faith, if no opponentof the amendment wishes to move to table, this proponent of the amendmentwill move to table,<ITAG tagnum="80">because I think we ought to be serious about these orders when theSenate enters into them. We ought to mean what we say and we ought notto wait until the moment arrives and then back away, hoping that the issuewill go away until tomorrow at 10 o'clock when those who oppose the amendmentsay they will filibuster the bill to death, rather than see the amendmentvoted on.</ITAG>[S16MY8-502]{S5929}DOLEMr. DOLE. If the majority leader would yield just for one observation?[S16MY8-503]{S5929}BYRDMr. BYRD. Yes.[S16MY8-504]{S5929}DOLEMr. DOLE. It is not part of the record but I did indicate to the Senatorfrom Michigan, Senator <T4>Levin</T4>, that there would not be a cloture motion filed prior to10 o'clock tomorrow and that was the agreement we made. It is not partof this agreement. That is another way to get a vote. That may be resortedto.I have not made a final determination but maybe others on the other sideof the issue may be circulating a cloture petition. We are in the processof doing that but it will not be filed, if at all, before 10 o'clock tomorrow.[S16MY8-505]{S5929}BYRDMr. BYRD. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Georgia.[S16MY8-506]{S5929}NUNNMr. NUNN. I have just one question to ask the majority leader as managerof this bill. Is this really necessary to go through this kind of maneuveringnow? Here we are. Everybody knows how they are going to vote on this. Everybodyknows we are not going to get a death penalty on this bill.[S16MY8-507]{S5929}DOLEMr. DOLE. We do not know that.[S16MY8-508]{S5929}NUNNMr. NUNN. We are not going to get an armed services bill, if the deathpenalty is on it, any time in the month of May. Let me put it that way.We all know we have to finish this bill.We just are not. We know it will be delayed. We know the INF Treaty iscoming up so anyone opposing the death penalty, all they have to do isdelay this bill until we get to the INF Treaty and then we delay it for3 or 4 weeks, then we come back and we are right here again.This is why we all complain about the quality of life. The reason we donot have a good quality of life around here is because we make ourselvesmiserable with u<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>se<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>less procedures and then we complain about the leadershipnot letting us go home at 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock. What are we trying toprove here? Has anybody got a point that they can say we are really tryingto prove because if not, I do not know why we do not go ahead and havea legitimate tabling motion, let the people vote their convictions on that,whether they are for or against the amendment.That is the way we ought to proceed. That is the way we anticipated. Ifwe try to play games on this we are simply going to spin our wheels. Weare not going to finish this bill any time soon. We are going to have tocome back in June.We have 50 more amendments on there most of which are going to fade awayby 10 o'clock tomorrow morning but will still be on there when we comeback in June. We may not finish this bill until July and we will not haveany difference. Even if we put the matter in conference, you know who weare going to be conferring with if the D'Amato amendment goes on? And Ifavor the amendment.We are going to be conferring with the House Judiciary Committee. Doesanyone believe we are going to come out with a defense bill with this onthere? Does anybody believe that?What are we doing around here? Have we really got to go through this kindof useless procedure, and I would say this on both sides, when it has noeffect, no purpose? [S16MY8-509]{S5929}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. Mr. President, would the Senator yield? [S16MY8-510]{S5929}NUNNMr. NUNN. That was a question, but__ The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader__ [S16MY8-511]{S5929}NUNNMr. NUNN. The majority leader can answer yes or no. Whatever he prefers.[S16MY8-512]{S5929}BYRDMr. BYRD. I think I already stated where I stand on this. I support thedeath penalty. But I think in view of the fact that we all were eager,last Friday, to move the bill forward the rest of the day and have somemore votes on other amendments, all quite willing to put off this amendmentuntil 3 o'clock today; if we had not entered into the order, that amendmentwould have stayed before the Senate on Friday and we probably would not<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>have <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>gotten any other amendments agreed to. So that was a part of the order. Are we going to take the position nowthat, in the future, we will seek whatever advantage we can at a givenmoment and that once we have <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>had <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the advantage, once we have secured the advantageand achieved whatever purposes we may have in mind, then when the timecomes to carry out the rest of the barg<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ai<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n, we will keep our seats and we will not move forwardand make the motion? So, Mr. President, as one who supports the death penalty but as one whobelieves that the Senate ought to carry out its orders that are enteredinto, and which in this case made it possible for the Senate to make progresson other amendments on the bill, I think the Senate ought to now carryout the order and vote on the tabling motion. I am not sure that a vote will render any decision on the tabling motion,but that is what we said we would do. There are a good many Senators hereready to vote. I will be glad to yield to the distinguished Senator.  [S16MY8-513]{S5929}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. I thank the majority leader, Mr. President. I just want torespond if I could slightly to the Senator from Georgia for whom I havegreat respect. Having been one of those who has tried to help change thescope of the military involvement in the war on drugs, one of the constantcritici<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>sms<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> that I ran into as we were having the negotiationswith the administration and with Members of the House and even here inthis body was the fact that we really have not demonstrated yet that weare really committed to this war on drugs to the extent that we ought toinvolve the military. One person in particular mentioned to me personally the fact that we hadnot even made it a death penalty to be involved as a kingpin in the drugmovement or to be involved in a death as part of a movement of drugs perse. I reported that to the Senator from New York, who had a visitor, theassistant U.S. attorney, and he proceeded to draw up this amendment. I want to say that part of the overall attack on the war on drugs is tomake certain that the world knows that we not only are going to commitour military offshore beyond the 3-mile limit, but we are going to restorethe death penalty in those very limited circumstances where a person isinvolved in the killing of a human being as part of the movement of drugsinto this country.   I think that that is the reason we want this vote now, and I would urgemy good friend, the distinguished majority leader, to make the motion totable. I think there will be an overwhelming support. There ought to bean overwhelming support of the proposition that a person who moves drugsor is part of the movement of drugs, who is responsible or partially responsible,substantially responsible for the death of another human being, ou<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>gh<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t to be subject to the death penalty. We ought torestore the death penalty in this area, and that is the reason. It is part and parcel of the overall attack on the war on drugs and, tome, it is as important as the issue of involving the military in the waron drugs beyond our 3-mile limit. I would urge those who are taking the position opposed to the death penaltyto look at the limited nature of this amendment, and it is very limited.I would say to my good friend, if he makes the motion to table, I wouldbe happy to join with him in making the motion to table, as an ardent supporterof the amendment, just to fulfill the time agreement that we belaboredourselves so much on on Friday evening. But I say to my good friend from Georgia, Mr. President, that to me thisis just as important as the involvement of our military people beyond the3-mile limit in the war against drugs. How in the world can we involve our military people and expose them tobeing killed as they really perform an act of war against the people whoare violating our borders with this contraband and not at the same timeindicate to the world that anyone that is involved in a death in thosetypes of situations is going to be held to answer and given the death penalty,if the jury so finds it is necessary. [S16MY8-514]{S5930}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader retains the floor. [S16MY8-515]{S5930}BYRDMr. BYRD. I yield. Yes. [S16MY8-516]{S5930}NUNNMr. NUNN. If I could just respond briefly. Frankly, I would say to my friendfrom Alaska I will vote on an up or down vote when it comes time to voteon it on the proper bill, for this approach. I think there are some technical flaws in the way the amendment is drawnbut they could be worked out over a period of time. So I am not arguingwith the Senator on the merits. In fact the Senator makes such a persuasiveargument I will let him come and confer with the House Judiciary Committeefor the summer, September, October, and November, because that is how longwe will be on this <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>if <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>it is put on this bill. We will not be able to get a defense bill out if this amendment is puton it. Let us face that. We know that. Maybe that does not matter to anybodyexcept the floor managers but it matters to us because we have to havea defense bill. Eventually it will matter to the whole body. I am not disagreeing with the Senator from Alaska on his substantive argument.What I am saying is frankly, procedurally what I hoped would work out isthe Senator from New York would be given a true test vote, where peoplevoted the way they saw their views on this issue on the motion to table.Then I was hoping we would get around, at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning,if the motion to table fails, the Senator from New York <ITAG tagnum="80">realizing how important it is to get this bill passed, realizing howimportant it is to go forward with the provisions that have already beeninserted on the bill relating to the military and drugs, would agree toremain for his amendment but would pull it down until we h<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ad <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>another bill, perhaps a Judiciary bill. </ITAG>But, if the Senator does not get a vote on this bill we are going to behere from now until June, July_and I will say this to both sides of theargument. He is going to get a vote at some point on this issue this year.So I do not see why we do not just go ahead and face it. Let everybodyvote their conscience and let us finish the bill. That is all I am asking.[S16MY8-517]{S5930}BYRDMr. BYRD addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.[S16MY8-518]{S5930}BYRDMr. BYRD. I fully agree with the Senator from Georgia. He is trying toget a bill. I do not think there is a likelihood we will get one if thisamendment goes on it, but that was not the way we were talking on Friday.The Senator from Michigan entered into the crafting of the unanimous-<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>co<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nsent request that enabled the Senator from New York[Mr. <T4>D'Amato</T4>] to set aside his amendment, which is what we all wantedto do on Friday. We wanted to set that amendment aside, and we were eagerto enter into an agreement with Mr. <T4>D'Amato </T4> that would allow us to put that aside the rest of theday on Friday and call it up today at 3 o'clock.Then when we reached 3 o'clock today, those who are opposed to the deathpenalty and who are opposed to the amendment do not want to take the floorand make a motion to table it.The Senator from Georgia is right, we are just going to play games, andif everybody votes against the amendment, the Senator from New York reallydoes not get a reading of the sentiment in the Senate. And if he has gottena reading on the sentiment in the Senate, I would then join with the otherson tomorrow in urging him to take the amendment down. He has an opportunityto get a reading on it, and the Senate now has the opportunity to expressits view, its will on tabling the amendment, but apparently that is notgoing to be the case.Apparently, the Senate is not going to reflect its true sentiment.[S16MY8-519]{S5930}D'AMATOMr. D'AMATO. Can I respond to the majority leader?[S16MY8-520]{S5930}BYRDMr. BYRD. Yes.[S16MY8-521]{S5930}D'AMATOMr. D'A<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>MATO<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. Mr. President, I think the majority leader hasexpressed the prevailing sentiment of this Senator and others of my colleagueswho are interested in seeing to it that the depth penalty is availablein proper cases, as we intend, as drafted in this amendment. We are goingto push forward and get some legitimate expression on that. I just as soondo it here tonight as opposed to be wrangling again at 10 o'clock.There will come an opportunity for us, and we are going to continue topress on th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>is<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. I am committed to that. But I think the majorityleader has very eloquently and adequately expressed the sense of the frustrationI think that the overwhelming majority of the Senate who feels that thereis a proper place for the death penalty as crafted in this legislationto be the law of the land.I am not going to, nor do I intend to, impede the business of this body.I think that is why we came to the agreement as we did this past Friday.I am not going to contend that we will, but certainly I would hope we canhave a legitimate vote on this issue so we could demonstrate whether ornot there is a<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>true feeling within this body that the death penaltyis appropriate, particu<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>arly in the case tha<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> relates to the organized <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>crime <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>enterprise that the drug people are running wherethey have these executions that are ordered or in wreckless disregard forhuman life.[S16MY8-522]{S5930}LEVINMr. LEVIN. Will the majority leader yield so I can move to table?[S16MY8-523]{S5931}BYRDMr. BYRD. Yes, I will momentarily, I told the distinguished Republicanleade<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> I would yield to him.[S16MY8-524]{S5931}DOLEMr. DOLE. I thank the leader. I want to say this is a very serious issue.It is one I think we can have strong differences of opinion on. We havehad them. We had them in 1986. We had the death penalty in the drug billin 1986. ``Oh, we can't do that. It is going to kill the drug bill.'' Wegave up again.The House has passed the death penalty twice. They are not going to holdit up. The American people do not give one whit who is on the House JudiciaryCommittee. They could care less who is on the Senate floor.Fifty percent of the American people list drugs as the No. 1 problem. Theydo not know about all these juris<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>dictional disputes we are all concerned about, properlyconcerned about.But I share the view of the majority leader.The Senator from New York made an accommodation to the Senate on Fridayin good faith, and he would like to get a true vote. Maybe if we have atrue vote reflecting the division in this body, he might decide not topursue the amendment. But it not, we have to get a closure vote.That is one way to get a true vote. If we get cloture on this amendmen<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, then we might be able to keep it on the bill. Hehas not made that dete<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mination yet and will not make it before, as I promis<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d the Senator from Michigan, 10 o'clock tomorrow.But if everybody votes no on the motion to table, that is no reflectionof our position, and, it would seem to me, the chairman and the rankingmember have done a remarkable job on this bill, to finish it in 5 legislativedays when you had 2 days of debate on base closing. Two days on b<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>se closing. One hour on the death penalty for thosewho inflict death and misery on children in America does not seem to meto be an overreaction by the Senator from New York or anybody else whofavors a death penalty when strictly limited.So I hope if there is a motion to table that it will be a true reflectionof the Senate's will, and that will help the Senator from New York makea final decision on what course of action he will pursue. [S16MY8-525]{S5931}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Michigan has askedme to yield to him so he may make a motion to table. I do that. [S16MY8-526]{S5931}LEVINMr. LEVIN. I thank my friend. I do not know whether my making a moti<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n to table will lead to a truer vote than anyoneelse making the motion to table, but I am happy to do that. Let me say two things, first, if I may, given the debate which has takenplace. First of all, I think the majority leader will agree when in conversationlast week there was a discussion as to who might make a motion to table,it was explicitly left unclear as to who might make a motion to table.So that is not a change in any understanding. [S16MY8-527]{S5931}BYRDMr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?[S16MY8-528]{S5931}LEVINMr. LEVIN. I will be happy to. [S16MY8-529]{S5931}BYRDMr. BYRD. When I put the request, I left it open because I did not knowwho would want to make it. I thought that someone among the Senators whohad been speaking out against the amendment would move to table it. [S16MY8-530]{S5931}LEVINMr. LEVIN. I thank the leader. Second, if I can thank my friend, the Republican leader, I greatly appreciatewhat he indicated here about the cloture motion. It was customary thatyou be so honorable, and it was indeed an honorable thing to do. I verymuch appreciate it. Again, just one word since there has been a word of debate on this, beforeI move to table. Most of the victims of drug-related killings are drugkingpins. Not police officers, but drug kingpins. This amendment treatsthe killing of a drug kingpin the same way as it treats the killing ofa police officer. They are both subject to capital punishment. This is not targeted at protec<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ing us against the killing of police officers. Maybeit is aimed to do that, but it is much broader than that since most ofthe victims are the kingpins. They are the ones who are killed in drug-relatedkillings much more than are police officers. Mr. President, I move to table. [S16MY8-531]{S5931}NUNNMr. NUNN. Will the Senator defer for 30 seconds?[S16MY8-532]{S5931}LEVINMr. LEVIN. I will be happy to. [S16MY8-533]{S5931}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, after this vote, we have several more amendments.We have 30, 40 left. I do <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>not <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>know how many amendments people want to call up now.I believe Senator <T4>Domenici</T4> has an amendment. We can have that one right after this.I think it will help. If we are able to move four or five more amendments, we will reach a point,I hope, tonight about 7 o'clock, assuming people really vote their convictionson this amendment, where we can tell people there are no more rollcalls.We have to wait and see as far as this bill is concerned. Senator <T4>Warner</T4> and I talked, and we will stay around here as late<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> tonight<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> as anyone wants to offer amendments because we willhave a time crunch tomorrow, if everything works out on capital punishmentand if we get that kind of time crunch. I do not want anyone denied theright to bring up their amendment. I want to thank the Senat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>r from Michigan. I was here the other day on thefloor when he made it clear that he was not binding himself to make themotion to table. I remember hearing that. So he acted, not on<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>y as he always does, honorably, but he put the Senateon notice implicitly that he might not move to table. I believe if we get a true vote on this amendment<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> it will be in the interest of the Senate, in theinterest of this amendment and<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>will be in the interest of passing this bill. I want to thank the Senator from New York for working out this amendment.I hope after this vote, if it is a true test vote, we can find a way tosecure final passage tomorrow morning.[S16MY8-534]{S5931}LEVINMr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for theyeas and nays.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are still working on that, so I suggest that we temporarilylay that aside, without losing its right in the turn, and take up eitherthe Domenici amendment or the Bumpers amendment. I do not think eitherwill take a lot of time, although I may be wrong.

I have had a pending amendment on the Persian Gulf ready for a portionof Friday and all day today, requiring about 1 hour, equally divided. Ihave had assurances that that would be the next order of business at somepoint. But it is my understanding that the Senator from North Carolinais going to follow the Senator from Arkansas. Is that correct? [S16MY8-557]{S5932}NUNNMr. NUNN. I am sorry. I have been trying to carry on another conversation,and I apologize. Will the Senate restate the question? The PRESIDING OFFICER.

[S16MY8-559]{S5932}NUNNMr. NUNN. I say to the Senator from Alaska that I am familiar with theamendment, but the amendment has not been agreed to. It will require debate,and I imagine that it will require a rollcall vote. I suggest that the Senator not move very far from the Chamber, becausewe have three or four matters that may not take very long; and perhapswithin 20 or 25 minutes_say, around 5:30_we will be able to take up theSenator's amendment. I do not believe it is under a formal time agreement,although the Senator has offered 1 hour, and I hope we can stay withinthat. I do not manage the order, and the Senator will have to get recognized.I suggest that he come back in the next 20 or 25 minutes and see if wecan get the amendment up later the afternoon.[S16MY8-560]{S5932}MURKOWSKIMr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, the most important principle of any arms controlagreement is improving national security. But arms control agreements cannotcontribute to national security u<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>less they can be effectively verified.If we cannot be sure that arms control treaties are being adhered to, weare, in fact, jeopardizing that security.The ciritical role played by verification explains why the intrusive verificationmeasures written into the INF Treaty have attracted so much attention.That is also why the Senate has been unwilling to take up that treaty untilall of the important verification provisions in the treaty hav<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> been agreed upon by both parties to the agreement.The confusion surrounding the verification provisions of the INF Treatymakes it clear that we must not repeat the mistakes involved in the INFnegotiation process.The new interest in verification resulting from the signing of the INFTreaty has produced a new form of nuclear proliferation, a proliferationof Government offices with the word verification in their title. I agree that verification research and development is more important nowthan it has ever been, and I'm sure all Members of the Senate agree thatwe need to do a better job in this critical area. I am privileged to have within the borders of my State two organizationswhich have been at the forefront of verification research and technologyfor many years. I am speaking of the two national laboratories in New Mexico,at Sandia and Los Alamos. I would recommend to my fellow Senators that they visit the DOE lab atSandia and take a look at the perimeter portal monitoring system whichwas developed and set up there. This is the design which will be deployedin the Soviet Union to assist in monitoring the INF Treaty. Some of the scientists at Sandia believe that the Soviets may even be interestedin purchasing or borrowing this same state of the art verification technology.I am in favor of verification research and development at the nationallaboratories and in other parts of the Government. But I am concerned thatthe effort is not well coordinated, especially as more resources are putinto this area and more bureaucratic players get into the game. I thi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>k that we are in danger of overdriving our headlightsby letting the State Department's interest in arms control agreements ou<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>run our abilities to verify those agreements. Let me give an example of what we are up against here. Last January theDefense Science Board in the Pentagon established a task force to studythe verification procedures for the START Treaty. This task force, staffed by well qualified people, completed its reportthis month. I expect that it will make a valuable contribution to our abilityto verify a START Treaty. But I remind my colleagues that the State Department began negotiatinga START agreement 6 years ago.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Yet, here we are, 6 years after we began negotiatinga START agreement, undertaking a study to determine how we can best verifyit. This is putting the arms control cart before the verification horse.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>We must take steps now to insure that our arms controlobjectives are in line with our verification capabilities. And we mustinsure that we begin the verification research today for the arms controlagreements which may be important to us in the future.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The amendment which I offer addresses this lack ofcoordination between our arms control intentions and our verification capabilities.It also seeks to minimize the confusion which may result from a mushroomingof new agencies all intent upon playing a role in the verification area.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>This amendment requires the next President to carefullyreview our arms control objectives and to then determine what will be neededin order to verify the agreements which we will seek.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The President will also examine the coordinationof our verification policy among the agencies involved in arms controland verification.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>At a minimum, this review would require the participationof the Departments of State, Defense, and Energy, the Central IntelligenceAgency, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the National SecurityCouncil.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The President would be asked to offer recommendationsfor improving policy coordination among these organizations and linkingour treaty objectives to our verification capabilities.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The findings of the President's review would be reportedto the Congress not later than June 30, 1989.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. President, I think that the floor manager andthe ranking member have seen this amendment and that they have no objection.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The Intelligence Committee might have some jurisdictionin this matter, and both the chairman and the ranking member have beenadvised of this amendment. I do not believe they have any objection.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. President, the new interest in verification resultingfrom the signing of the INF Treaty has produced a new form of nuclear proliferation,a proliferation of Government offices with the word ``verification'' intheir title.Essentially, what the Senator from New Mexico is asking is that the Presidentof the United States, by June 30 of next year, report and recommend tothe Congress of the United States a method of centralizing the activitiesof verification and the science of verification and relate that to policymakingthat will involve the need for verification and verification science andtechnology.Some of us are beginning to worry that our arms control negotiations getahead of our verification technology, or vice versa, or that there is sucha proliferation of verification research and technology that there is nota coordination as we move to enforcing our activities, as a nation, inthe field of verification.Some of us are even concerned that policy is being made without knowingthe extent to which verification technology has evolved, or the extentto which we will be unable to verify the agreements under negotiation.This amendment is asking the President to look at it all and tell us howwe ought to make more sense out of it and where it should be focused andwhere in the Government some body should be in charge of pulling it alltogether. That is essentially what it does.[S16MY8-569]{S5933}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I think this is a good amendment.The Senator is right, in the sense that we have to pull this verificationtogether. We have to have more coordination.It is not only part of the INF Treaty; but most of us concerned with theINF Treaty recognize that the reason it is important is that it is a precedentfor other treaties that will be much more militarily significant that theINF Treaty_for example, START and the conventional arms discussions whichare underway.Although I have resisted reports and think we have too many of them, Ithink this is a very important report and will focus not only on Congress,when we receive it, but also the administration, as they prepare in thisarea.I recommend that the amendment be accepted.[S16MY8-570]{S5933}WARNERMr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I would completely agree with the Senator fromArkansas.I would hope we get a START agreement. I hope we get a START agreementduring the Reagan administration, but I am not at all certain that we aregoing to be able to accomplish that goal, particularly those of us whofeel so strongly as I think most Members of this body do, that we haveto iron out the details. We have just gone through an INF debate wherethey spent a long period of years debating it and discussing it, and theystill did not reach an agreement that did not have to have great scrutinyand did not have some problems<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> which we have just gone through.My point is this: We have no certainty whatsoever that we are going toget a START agreement in this admin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>is<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tration any time soon. We hope we do but we are notcertain of that.I believe interim restraint is very important. I think the administration_thisis speaking only for myself; I do not speak for the committee on this;there are differing views_I think that the admin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>is<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tion made a mistake in not continuing the interimrestraint regime. Last year in the conference we debated this with the House. We had a three-waynegotiation with the admin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>stration. We finally concluded that we should notaddress this issue in a formal way, but we would take steps and did takesteps in last year's conference to informally stay within the general rangeof the overall ceilings that would have been the ceilings had SALT II beenratified and put into effect.I have never favored, as the Senator know<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, voting by majority vote in the Senate to formallyrequire following an agreement which has never become a treaty becauseit has never been ratified. So, I have been reluctant to impose by law provisions of a treaty whichhas never been ratified which I believe obscures the overall scheme ofthe Senate ratification of a treaty.We had a unique set of circumstances last year when the Senator from Kansasmade it clear that we are not writing into law any SALT II provisions,and that enabled me to vote for the Senator's amendment. We did not havethat set of circumstances this year, and I voted against the Senator'samendment. That may be technical to some people. But it is important tome, and that was the rationale.To make a long statement short<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>r, I will say to the Senator that as the chairmanof the committee and as one of the conferees, I will certainly be workingwith our own conferees on the Senate side and on the House side to finda way, a practical pragmatic way, to see that we stay within the generalrange of the subceilings that would have been in effect had SALT II becomea treaty and therefore the law of the land. There are not easy ways to do that. We do have ups and downs, as the Senatorwell knows. When the Trident is deployed, you go over the ceilings. Whensome older submarines are taken out, that helps bring the ceiling backdown. We have some very complicated plans for retirement in the sense <ITAG tagnum="80">of how they impact with the fiscal year. Some of the plans for retiringsubmarines that I have heard about, not formal now, but some of those becomeeffective in 1990.</ITAG>I can say to the Senator that I will work to further the goal that he hasarticulated here, and that is seeing that while both superpowers are negotiatinghopefully on the START agreement we should not have a lifting of all restraintswhich would then simply perpetuate the arms race and cause both sides tohave less and less confidence and also increase the instability of theworld.I share the Senator's goal in that respect. I will be consulting with himand with others as this conference takes place. I will be working withChairman <T4>Aspin </T4>on the House side; Senator <T4>Warner, </T4>my colleague here in the Senate; and others to basicallyaccomplish something similar to what we accomplished last year coming outof conference.(Mr. DASCHLE assumed the chair.)[S16MY8-584]{S5935}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. I thank the Se<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>na<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tor very much for his remarks that I think are righton target. Obviously, he and I agree on the necessity for restraint andthe one point he made which should not be lost on anybody is that we doindeed have a tendency to go up and come down. We have been up since thePresident elected to break out of the SALT II treaty constraints. We havebeen up as high as 1,348. I think right now we are probably at least 10below that<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> maybe a little bit lower than that.But as the Senator knows this fall we have a Trident submarine in Septembergoing to sea. Next May we have still another one. Each one of those submarineshave 24 MIRV'd missile and bomber systems. And meanwhile we will only bedismantling one Poseidon submarine, with just 16 MIRV'd missiles.But having said all of that, I do not object because I know that it isnecessary in strategic weaponry to occasionally go up to a fairly highlevel as long as we know we are coming back down.I might say at this point, the Soviet Union has shown a remarkable amountof constraint in this whole thing. They are in a much better position,as the Senator knows, to break out of the SALT Treaty than we are. Theyhave hot production lines on a lot more strategic systems than we have.They have three ICBM systems in production to our one: the SS-18 mod 5,the SS-24, and the SS-25, versus MX for us. They have two SLBM systems_theSS-N-20 and SS-N-23_in production to our one, the Trident II and they havetwo bombers in production_the Bear H and the Blackjack_to our none. Forexample, let us assume that Gorbachev's position is not as solid as wemight like t<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> think it is. Obviously, if Gorbachev falls, thatmeans the hard liners are back in control. That would also mean that, inall probability, they would not show the kind<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> of<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> restraint they have been showing in face of thefact that we are flagrantly exceeding the SALT II limits. For example,they did not continue their nuclear testing moratorium when we kept ontesting. After about 18 months they resumed testing. And it's been 18 monthssince the United States started exceeding the SALT limits.As of this moment, we have about 1,336 MIRV'd missile systems and the Sovietshave about 1,270 or, 66 less. For bean counters, maybe that is important.I do not think it is terribly relevant one way or the other.But I just do believe strongly that if we go up and back down and backup a little bit higher and back down not quite so far, if we do not havea START agreement, and one of these years we get one and say we cut warheadsin half, but we wind up back about where we are right now.So I thank the Senator from Georgia for his very statesmanlike statementon this issue. It is one that we deal with constantly. We have a tendencyto treat it almost ritualistically and by rote and not for the fact thatwe are really talking about the fate of the planet Earth.So I thank the Senator for his cooperation on this. I do not want to takethe Senate's time any further on this.I see my colleague from Vermont is here, who had asked to be allowed tospeak on this. I will be happy to yield the floor in his favor.[S16MY8-585]{S5935}NUNNMr. NUNN. I thank the Senator from Arkansas.[S16MY8-586]{S5935}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. I yield the floor.[S16MY8-587]{S5935}LEAHYMr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I believe it was Yogi Berra who once said thatit was deja vu all over again. That is almost the way it is here. We seemto be keep going back on the Bumpers-Leahy-Chafee-Heinz amendment. In someways you would almost think we would not have to. You would think thateverybody would accept the fact that if we are going to be out negotiatingfor greater arms control that we might stop just building, on both sides,a continued escalation of the nuclear arms race.But the need for some controls on strategic weapons is too great and thetime too pressing to leave this issue unsettled. Therefore, my friendsand I reintroduced the same amendment the Senate adopted by a 57-to-41vote last October 2. The only change, as the Senator from Arkansas andothers know, is to make the effective dates of the funding prohibitionrun through fiscal year 1989 instead of 1988. Otherwise, the amendmentis the one 57 Senators voted for last October. It is substantively thesame as the interim restraint provision in the defense authorization billwhich the House just recently passed.Now, this amendment would prohibit the United States from deploying anyMIRV'd missiles and heavy bombers armed with the cruise missiles in excessof the 820, 1,200, and 1,320 level.It empowers the President, of course, to waive this restriction if at certaintimes the Soviets are extending any of those levels. In other words, thereis a requirement in here. And the way it is set up, it gives no incentiveto the Soviets to go forward when we stand still because the Presidentsimply has to certify they have done that and we can move forward. Butit is about the only thing that sits out there in the way for us to saythat enough is enough.My good friend, the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee,has stated that he shares the goal of our amendment to keep in place aninterim cap on United States and Soviet strategic systems pendin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> a START Treaty. In fact, as I recall, the Senatorfrom Georgia voted for that last year.Now I recognize the distinguished chairman wants the flexibility to workout in conference with the House some kind of steps which will keep therestraints on the arms race but does not want the Senate to vote on ouramendment. I have brought enough bills to conference to know how any chairmanwould want that kind of flexibility.The distinguished chairman has also stated that he intends to work throughthe coming fiscal year to maintain an<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>interim restraint regime. In our discussions, hemade clear he would advocate and work for additional requirements of olderUnited States multiple warhead systems so long, of course, as the Sovietscontinue to show restraint in their own comparable systems. In other words,it is the position of the distinguished chairman to keep this interim restraintframework in place.I much prefer a legally binding funding prohibition on United States actionswhich would take us above some clearly stated numerical cap, such as thosein our amendment, so long as it is on a reciprocal basis with the SovietUnion.But I understand, from our battles on this floor, that the cards are stackedagainst the Bumpers-Leahy, et al, amendment becoming law, even though 57Senators voted for it last year. So I am not going to seek a vote on thisamendment, because I rely on the statements of the chairman of the ArmedServices Committee.But, Mr. President, I have come back with this issue every year now fora half a dozen years. I feel very, very <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>trongly that it is in the best security interestof the United States to have a real nuclear arms control. Also, I believevery strongly that we could continue to seek such arms control and reallywreck anything that we might gain if, while we are seeking arms control,we engage in a continuously escalating nuclear arms race.The Bumpers-Leahy amendment says: ``Let's everybody pause and think aboutwhere we are. Enough is enough. Let us stop here. As far as the SovietUnion stops here, let us do the s<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>am<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e and then support the President of the United Statesin seeking realistic reductions.''It does us no good to say that we will support efforts maybe this yearor next year or 4 years from now on the part of the President of the UnitedStates to seek reductions if what he is going to be reducing is somethingthat have added to every year. It makes no difference if all we do is toescalate the nuclear arms race and then somebody, someday when sanity finallypeeks through, say, ``My gosh, it's about time to reduce what we builton.'' Let us start from a smaller base. That is all the Bumpers-<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>L<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eahy says; that with the thousands of warheads onboth sides, that should be enough for any country, that should be enoughfor any kind of deterrent.

Mr. President, it is well known, that the UnitedStates has invested billions of dollars in military real estate in theUnited States and abroad. It is also known that some of this investmentis no longer used, is underutilized or has long ago outlived its originalpurpose. This property can be sold and contribute substantial revenues to the U.S.Treasury. However, this property should also be evaluated for alternative uses toaddress critical problems of this country. The U.S. prison system is 60 percent overcapacity today. It is projectedto get even more crowded during the next decade due to mandatory sentencesimposed in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and the Sentencing Guidelines.In anot<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>er area, the problem is similar but even more severein some respects. Persons seeking drug abuse treatment simply cannot findhelp. Drug abuse treatment facilities are lacking in every State and existingprograms cannot come close to meeting the demand. There are long waitinglists in every count<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of every State of persons desperately seeking help.Mr. President, we have to provide prison space and we should provide drugtreatment. But construction costs are scaring us off. Therefore, the amendment I offer is intended to offer an alternative toconstruction of all new facilities. My amendment creates a Commission onAlternative Utilization of Military Facilities which shall be responsiblefor evaluating and identifying military facilities which could be usedas cor<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ectional facilities or drug treatment facilities.The Commission would be made up of representatives of the Department ofDefense, Bureau of Prisons, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and GeneralServices Administ<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ation who wil<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> be appointed by the President. Mr. President, the use of military facilities by the Bureau of Prisonsfor correctional facilities is being practiced today. In fact, the effectiveexample always used exists at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. This programhas proven successful. Both the military and the prison system benefits.The base commander is pleased because work programs by the i<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mates provide jobs and saves money for his purposes.Bureau of Prison officials are pleased because placing nonviolent inmatesin such facilities allows more space for other prisons in the overcrowdedprison system. I am told that base commanders at military bases across the country haveindicated that programs like the Federal Prison Camp at Eglin would bewelcome. My amendment would provide for a formal structure for <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>more <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>future cooperative efforts. And, my amendment would also allow space at active or nonactive militaryfacilities to be used for drug treatment by the National Institute on DrugAbuse. Such facilities could often be ideal for residential treatment facilitieswhich are<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>so lacking in this country. I intend to offer legislationat a later date which will authorize the Bureau of Prisons, National Instituteon Drug Abuse, and State drug abuse <ITAG tagnum="80">agencies to establish appropriate programs at these identified facilitiesto address the tremendous demand for space for incarceration, incarcerationwith drug abuse treatment and drug abuse treatment. Such programs costswill be borne by Bureau of Prisons and the National Institute on Drug Abuseand will be required to be operated in cooperation with base commanders,where appropriate, so that activities like work programs will benefit inmateand patient, base operations and the overall efficiency and cost-effectivenessof the military facility as well as the specific correctional or treatmentprograms. </ITAG>Mr. President, I want to stress that my amendment does not dictate whatfacilities could be used or what programs should be where. What my amendmentdoes is create a Commission of experts from the Defense Department, Bureauof Prisons, National Institute on Drug absue, and GSA who will determinewhat space is available and for what purposes it could best be used. Itwill be up to the Commission and the appropriate agencies to determinethe correctional and treatment programs that would be appropriate for specificspace on active and nonactive military facilities. I am convinced that our vast investment in military property can go farto help us with the critical problems we face with our prisons and drugtreatment. I hope my colleagues agree. Mr. President, we have been talking both to the ranking member and thechairman about this amendment. I think it makes ultimate sense to do this,and I hope the amendment would be adopted. I have other debate<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, but I would be happy to reserve that. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia. [S16MY8-597]{S5937}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will momentarily yield the floor to my colleaguefrom New Hampshire so the Senator can speak to this, but I wonder if Imight ask the Senator from Florida a question or two about this first.The trauma connected with the closure of a military base is very severe.As a matter of fact, communities through the years have grown very attachedto them. In most instances the communities provide a great deal of theamenities for military bases personnel that are there. Therefore, it isgoing to be a severe hardship on the community and severe hardship on theMembers of the Congress that represent that community. My understanding of the current law is that if a base is closed, then thefirst priority goes to the Bureau of Prisons. Is that correct?<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S16MY8-598]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5937}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>CHILES<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. CHILES. I think that is correct. Immediatelywhen a base is declared surplus property, there is a list of priorities.The No. 1 agency on that list is the Bureau of Prisons.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S16MY8-599]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5937}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>WARNER<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. WARNER.

Whilethe amendment does not influence the ``fit for closure policy,'' we arenot trying to impact that policy at all. I think that it does provide analternative method. It does set up a commission and that commission willbe reporting to the President and to the Congress.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>So I think the Senator could well make that point.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S16MY8-603]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5937}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>WARNER<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. WARNER.

The Senator from New Hampshire.[S16MY8-608]{S5937}HUMPHREYMr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, if the provisions on base closing surviveconference, that will be a remarkable, almost unbelievable achievementfor this body and for the House. And I certainly hope that is the case.My first reaction to the amendment offered by the Senator from Floridawas that it would make a very difficult situation even more difficult forcommunities and especially Members of Congress representing those communitiesin the case of base closings. But, in discussing the amendment, it turnsout that existing law is even worse in that respect; that the Chiles amendmentwill ameliorate the situation a little.But it seems to me that what have discovered is the need to amend existinglaw_and I am not proposing we do it at this moment_but it seems to me thereis a real need to amend existing law because it is hard enough for a Senatoror a Congressman to go to a community where a base is slated for closingand say: ``Look, we are going to cut off this large source of the community'srevenues and, not only that, but you have to host a prison. That is a doublewhammy. That makes things very difficult for Members and communities. Butthat apparently is existing law, as Senator from Florida has just pointedout in the di<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>sc<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ussion with the Senator from Virginia. The existinglaw is even worse than what he recommends.So, I think we have discovered a situation that needs to be rectified atsome fa<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ir<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ly early date through amendment of existing law.So that in the difficult circumstances of base closings, we do not haveto compound the problem by telling a community, not only are we going totake away this base and all the revenue you are used to, but you have tohost a prison as well. That is a double nig<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ht<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mare.

I know there are American there. I know we haveAmerican service people there. We will continue to have Americans there.But for the Senate to basically say that we want more Americans there,although I would say in useful employment and very important employment,is something I think needs to be debated and discussed.I hope the Senator will address that point, particularly the question ofsafety and whether we are urging Americans, basically more Americans, tomove in harm's way.

Now, we already know that we have made exceptions on 11tankers, but it is important to note that we have two American crew memberson each tanker: We have a licensed U.S. captain and a radio operator. Andthese are requirements in compliance with the law.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The question of why we do not man those tankers withU.S. personnel has been raised by the floor manager, and the issue hasbeen the suggestion perhaps this puts the U.S. sailors in harm's way.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>That is certainly a legitimate concern, but whenone considers the realization that we have currently in the Persian Gulf14,000 military personnel and 29 naval warships protecting an expandednumber of vessels, I think it is important at this time to point out thatwe have expanded our assistance in the Persian Gulf not only to cover ourown 11 vessels that have been reflagged_and sources from the Departmentof Defense indicate that our new policy will be to provide assistance toany nonbelligerent ship not carrying contraband, not trading with the belligerentin international waters if it is attacked, if it requests assistance, ifour vessel is in a position to help and is not involved in another task_inother words, Mr. President, we have expanded our position in the PersianGulf substantially. We basically offer assistance to all friendly nationsin the Persian Gulf.So one wonders why, indeed, are we not involved in having American seamenon our U.S. ships.Well, I think as we reflect on the merits of the issues before us, we shouldconsult with the people who are responsible for providing merchant seamenon U.S.-flagged tankers, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed inthe <T4>Record </T4>a letter of February 9 addressed to President Reagan fromthe National Marine Engineers Beneficial Association.There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the <T4>Record, </T4>as follows:<ITAG tagnum="61">National Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="53">Washington, DC, February 9, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="54">Hon. </ITAG><T4>Ronald Reagan,</T4><ITAG tagnum="55">The President, The Whi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>te<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> House, Washington, DC.</ITAG>[S16MY8-631]{S5939}<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Dear Mr. President: </T4>On behalf of more than 50,000 American merchantmariners, both officers and unlicensed, we urge that your Administrationnot proceed with reported efforts to waive the manning portion of the recently-enactedCommercial Fishing Industry Vessel Anti-Reflagging Act of 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This Act, now P.L. 100-239, was passed by the Congress in order toclose a loophole created by a 1985 Coast Guard interpretation of 46 U.S.C.Sec. 8103 that permitted the use of non-U.S. crews, with the exceptionof the Master, instead of U.S. citizens, on board the Kuwaiti vessels reflaggedlast year. Had this loophole not been closed, it would have underminedmuch of the U.S.-flag merchant fleet by setting a precedent that couldhave been used by others to obtain the benefits of the U.S. flag withoutassuming many of its responsibilities. It also could have resulted in cargodiversions to Canadian ports that would have severely impacted U.S. portson both coasts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We now, however, understand that your Administration is seriouslyconsidering waiving, on national defense grounds, the provisions of P.L.100-239 in the case of the eleven reflagged Kuwaiti tankers. We believet<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ha<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t such a waiver is unjustified for reasons of nationaldefense and not supportable in law unless there is a Presidential declarationof a national emergency.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As regards national defense, there simply is no military basis forthese reflagged Kuwaiti vessels not to have all American crews. All Americancrewing would enable these vessels to be under real, not imaginary, Americanoperational control if these vessels were needed for the U.S. flag. Thepresence of nearly all non-American crews certainly does not enhance themilitary or operational effectiveness of the individual vessels. And, Americanmerchant mariners are available and ready to fill every position on thesevessels. Indeed, we have made the point over and over again that, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>as<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> we have demonstrated throughout our history, ourmariners are second to none in answering the call to our nation's defense.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some will claim that a national defense waiver is justified becausethe Kuwaitis want it that way. This appears to us to be a clear case ofthe tail wagging the dog. On a mission where thousands of brave young Americansare putting their lives on the line, it simply does not seem right thatKuwait should also be able to dictate that we change our long-establishedlaws simply to make a better bottom line for the ledger of the Kuwaitinational shipping company. Perhaps last year, when the vessels were reflagged,there may have been some nervousness as to whether insistence on U.S. crewingwould drive the Kuwaitis into the arms of the Soviet Union. But today,after many months in which U.S. protection is functioning well, we findsuch worries to be unsupportable. It is inconceivable that the Kuwaitiswould tilt toward the Russians because we, in response to the clear willof the Congress, replaced all, or on a phased basis, foreign crews withU.S. crews.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Indeed, we make the case instead that a waiver now for these Kuwaitivessels undermines rather than strengthens our defense. It results in theloss of employment for more than 500 American merchant seamen. It setsa precedent for further waivers that, once granted, can be twisted to coverevery commercial or diplomatic occasion. And it sends a message to allconcerned that the American merchant marine is expendable, a message thatruns counter to numerous U.S. Navy studies as well as the reports of yourCommission on Merchant Marine and Defense, all of which emphasize thatthe shortage of U.S. crews is now and will be in the future a major nationaldefense liability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As regards the legal case for such a national defense waiver, we findthat it does not exist. Nowhere in Title 46 U.S.C. is there authority fora waiver, in view of the fact that U.S. crews are ready and available,except in the case of a ``proclaimed national emergency.'' So far, nonehas been declared in the current Persian Gulf shipping crisis.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We urge, therefore, that your Administration not proceed with a nationaldefense waiver for the reflagged Kuwaiti vessels. We accept and supportthe need to be able to waive provisions of law when national defense istruly at stake and when it is done in accordance with the provisions ofthat law for such a waiver. We believe, however, that such a waiver atthis point would merely be for diplomatic convenience at best and, indeed,could harm our nation's defense in the future.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We thank you for your consideration of this matter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Sincerely yours,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="34">C.E. </ITAG><T4>DeFries,</T4><ITAG tagnum="57"><CODE-213>5</CODE-213></ITAG><T3><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>President, National Marine<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213></T3><ITAG tagnum="58">Engineers' Beneficial Association.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213></ITAG>[S16MY8-632]{S5939}Shannon J.<ITAG tagnum="34"/><T4>Shannon J.

We have agreed to go so far as to licensefor captains and radio operators and no further, but I think we ought toreflect a little bit more on the inequity in existence when we recognizeagain the question of contribution from the standpoint of the Kuwaitisand our own Nation.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The beneficiary of the oil clearly is not the UnitedStates. Approximately 56 percent of the oil in the Persian Gulf ultimatelyfinds its way to our friends in Japan, about 35 percent to Eastern Europe,and a<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>bo<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ut 6 to 9 percent to the United States. We are payinga price in the Persian Gulf, Mr. President. That price is about $130 milliona year. We have 29 naval warships in the area at this time and, as I haveindicated, 14,000 military personnel. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>When we get down to the question of Kuwait and what their attitude hasbeen so far, we have to recognize that they have refused to employ Americantankers and American seamen in their trade despite the fact that our seamenare not employed and that we have many tankers that are lying idle. Tosuggest that we do not have American tankers ready, Mr. President, is incorrect.We have a number of them, including the <T3>Atlantic</T3> at 404,000 deadweight tons, the <T3>Pacific</T3> at 404,000 deadweight tons, the <T3>New York</T3> at 258,000 deadweight tons, the <T3>Maryland</T3> at 264,000, the <T3>Massachusetts</T3> at 264,000, and the <T3>Williamsburg</T3> at 225,000. Most of these tankers, Mr. President,were built with U.S. construction subsidies. Now, we were almost successful in leasing one tanker, and I will get intothat in a few minutes because I think this body deserves to know the extentto which our Government went to try to lease this tanker and the results.I think it justifies consideration of the pending amendment of the Senatorfrom Alaska. In October <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>19<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>87, Chesapeake Shipping Co., which is wholly ownedby a Kuwaiti oil tanker company, won bidding for charter of the Americanvessel, the <T3>Maryland.</T3> And this came about as a consequence of a great dealof effort of the Senator from Alaska and others to try to encourage someU.S. participation in the Persian Gulf in the commercial carriage of crudeoil. As we know, the <T3>Maryland</T3> was built with U.S. construction subsidies and MarAdhad to foreclose on the Maryland. The terms of the charter that were undertakenwould be that the Chesapeake Shipping Co. would pay a total of $5 millionfor a 2-year bareboat charter. That was broken down as follows: $2.5 millionfor drydocking and repairs and $2.5 million for the use of the vessel.The proposal required_and it was agreed upon by all parties_that the vessel,which was a U.S.-flag vessel, would carry a 100 percent U.S. crew. Now,Mar<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Ad <CODE-213>0</CODE-213> went ahead and began the repairs in December. Mostof the repairs had been completed. Mar<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Ad<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> determined an additional $1 million in repairs wouldbe needed, but the Kuwaitis would not agree to an additional $1 millionin costs, nor would they agree to extend the charter to amortize the costfor 1 more year and as a consequence, Mr. President, the deal collapsed.Now, Mar<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>A<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d had <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> pay $3.5 million for the repairs that wer<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> done and then had to put up th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> <T3>Maryland</T3> for rebid.So, Mr. President, there has been more than just discussions on puttingU.S. crews on vessels to be chartered by the Kuwaiti Government. Indeed,an agreement was reached, and the reason that the agreement was not finallyput through was simply a matter of the Kuwaitis' figuring that it was cheaperto continue using their own ships. It was an economic reason, Mr. President.The plan with regard to the <T3>Maryland</T3> was for the U.S. taxpayer to pick up the costs and hopethat we could recover somehow in a pending sale of the tanker <T3>Maryland.</T3>There are two other Mar<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>A<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d vessels, the <T3>Massachusetts</T3> and the <T3>New York.</T3> These could be available if indeed repairs would orcould be made.But the point we have to reflect on is that we have already initiated discussions.We simply let our guard down and did not follow through.Further, Mr. President, when we consider the changing role of Kuwaiti investmentsin the United States, I think it causes us some justification for reflection.Using funds derived from trade and commerce, namely oil, protected by Americanlives, ships, resources, and money, the Kuwaiti Government is qui<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>et<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ly buying up assets in this country. That is whatfree trade is all about, Mr. President. The Senator from Alaska is supportiveof that. But I think we must recognize the change from what previouslywas a situation where the United States had a strong and healthy domesticproducing capability as well as a refining capability.The Kuwaiti Government is coming to the United States and buying up refineries.There is nothing wrong with that, but it does reflect on our energy security.We are seeing the Kuwaiti Government come in and purchase 100 percent ofSante Fe, International, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>an<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> energy company with $1.4 billion in 1986 revenues.Again, there is nothing wrong with that. We find tha<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the Kuwaiti Government now owns one-fifth of BPof America, which owns 100 percent of the Standard Oil Co., which owns50 percent of the oil produced fro<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>m<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Pr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>dhoe Bay.The poi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nt<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> is we are now seeing foreign ownership taking avery significant position in our refining crude oil capacity, and as welook at the tradition of the OPEC nations where they have attempted tostrangle the production of oil in order to create scarcity to get the priceup<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> we are seeing that ownership transfer to the UnitedStates. I think it is something that should cause us a good deal of reflectionas we consider our energy policy.The Senator from Alaska raises this point simply to share a point of viewthat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> indeed, o<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>il<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> moves very rapidly and as a consequence of thatmovement foreign ownership of our own domestic oil industry and refiningcapacity can come about in a very rapid manner.Some have suggested that, well, we do not have adequate individuals inour maritime industry available to take some 500 jobs that could be createdif we took the 11 tankers that have already been reflagged and put U.S.crews on them. Well, in 1986, it is estimated that somewhere between 15,000and 20,000 unemployed maritime union members were available to go to seain all capacities on these vessels.One wonders as well why some of these personnel would not find jobs onthe available U.S.-flag ships such as the <T3>Maryland</T3> or the <T3>Williamsburg</T3> that would like to be utilized in the trade. I think we have been able to cite some of the specifics with regard tothe availability of adequate personnel to man the ships. I think we havemade a point with regard to the fact that we have already negotiated toutilize merchant vessels but we have simply failed to maintain the leverage.And that leverage is based on the fact that we have our Navy over thereprotecting friendly nations, and, there is the question of why not havesome of our own ships. We noticed the British are over there hauling oil in British tankers. Wehave noticed that the Soviets have had vessels in the area but not theUnited States. We do not have a merchant ship in there because of a fear.And that fear seems to be based on the fact that we are putting some ofour seamen in dangerous positions yet our seamen have countered that theirinterest is in jobs. When we look at the record over there, Mr. President,we find that the Iraqis and the Iranians have been constantly going backand forth on each others ships and the platforms and shore base facilities.Yet of all the ships fired on over the last several years, there is onlyone record of a small ship being sunk. I do not mean to say that we shouldput our seamen in harm's way by any means but by the same token where isour obligation? Do we have an obligation to participate to some extentto the carriage of that oil? The Senator from Alaska happens to think thatis the case. [S16MY8-637]{S5940}WARNERMr. WARNER. Could I ask a question? [S16MY8-638]{S5940}MURKOWSKIMr. MURKOWSKI. I would be happy to respond. [S16MY8-639]{S5940}WARNERMr. WARNER. The merchant seamen in the history of this country have neverfeared going in harm's way, and there is a long record of courageous activityby these men over the years. [S16MY8-640]{S5941}MURKOWSKIMr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator is correct. [S16MY8-641]{S5941}WARNERMr. WARNER. But I am not sure as I <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>istened carefully to the argument. Is it that theyapplied for jobs aboard these reflagged ships and were denied the jobsfor some reason? [S16MY8-642]{S5941}MURKOWSKIMr. MURKOWSKI. No. [S16MY8-643]{S5941}WARNERMr. WARNER. Or is it the Senator is anxious to have some American-owned,American-flagged vessels incorporated in the original concept of 11? [S16MY8-644]{S5941}MURKOWSKIMr. MURKOWSKI. First, there are two considerations. Under the reflaggingagreement that we went into where we took the 11 Kuwaiti ships, there hadto be a waiver that was requested by the Secretary of Defense. That waiverwas granted, and the unions appealed the authority of that waiver. Andthe court determined that indeed that waiver was justified. That waiverwas allowing a limitation of a captain and a radio officer on those ships.That was all. The law requires that if those ships ever touch a U.S. port,they will have to be full of U.S. crude. But the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Alaska know that indeedthose ships will never touch a U.S. port. The point is the Kuwaitis wouldmuch rather use their own people or crews from other nations on those shipsthan take United States sailors and put<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> them<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> on those ships because the cost is much less touse foreign sailors. The point that the Senator from Alaska is trying to communicate to hiscolleagues is why the Kuwaitis when pushed a little bit partially negotiatedfor the <T3>Maryland,</T3> and then decided that it was uneconomic to proceed withan American-flagged ship other than the 11. And as a consequence the Senatorfrom Alaska recalls the Kuwaiti Ambassador coming to his office and explainingto the Senator from Alaska why they were not going ahead with the charterof the <T3>Maryland.</T3> And the <T3>Williamsburg</T3> was also proposed at that time. The Kuwaiti Ambassador simply said it is an economic issue only, in otherwords, advising the Senator from Alaska it is much cheaper to use his ownships. But we have American sailors on the beach.[S16MY8-645]{S5941}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, I certainly understand that. My State is a maritimeState. Indeed, I know full well the extraordinary unemployment among ourmerchant sailors at this time.I wonder, Mr. President, if the Senator would yield the floor at this timeso I could make a few comments.[S16MY8-646]{S5941}MURKOWSKIMr. MURKOWSKI. I would be happy to yield.[S16MY8-647]{S5941}WARNERMr. WARNER. First, a procedural one. Does the Senator wish to have a callfor a vote? If not, this Senator will because I think Senators should examinethis amendment with great care, and I believe it is not the proper authorityfor the manager to accept this because it is a very important amendment.I have not had the opportunity to discuss it with a number of my colleagues.So my first question is does the Senator intend to ask for a vote?[S16MY8-648]{S5941}MURKOWSKIMr. MURKOWSKI. I would like to have a bit of a colloquy.[S16MY8-649]{S5941}WARNERMr. WARNER. I am not suggesting a tabling. I would just simply ask forthe yeas and nays.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?[S16MY8-650]{S5941}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, objection. At the appropriate time, the Senatorfrom Nebraska intends to move to table.[S16MY8-651]{S5941}WARNERMr. WARNER. I once again just ask for the yeas and nays.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficientsecond.The yeas and nays were ordered.[S16MY8-652]{S5941}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, Kuwait now provides fuel for the United Statesoperations over there up to around $5 million a month. These are just someof the things Kuwait is now doing to facilitate the operations over there.Once our convoys enter Kuwaiti territorial waters, Kuwait provides escort,and then when we require security protection of United States ships inKuwaiti ports, the Kuwaitis provide t<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ha<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t protection.So I wish to have the record reflect that there are, I think, some contributionsby Kuwait to the overall operation in the gulf at this time.As yet I am still undecided as to how this Senator will cast his vote becauseI am concerned like the Senator from Alaska with respect to the unemployedmembers of our merchant fleet, and recall very well how the Senator hasfought for over a year now for the very principles that are embraced inthe amendment.[S16MY8-653]{S5941}MURKOWSKIMr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if my friend from Virginia would respond to thesense of the resolution. The resolution does not mandate that the 11 Kuwaitivessels that have been United States flagged be United States crewed.It simply urges the Kuwaitis and the Kuwaiti Government to be sensitiveand try to do more to the maximum extent possible to employ United Statesmerchant marine personnel to man its tankers or reflagged tankers withUnited States flags. In other words, it would seem to me that it wouldbe in our best interests_and I appeal to the Senator from Virginia becausehe is very knowledgeable in these matters, having been in the Navy, anda former Secretary of the Navy. And the situation that we have in our Nationwhere it is important that we maintain a stronger merchant fleet. Thatincludes a merchant fleet of tankers. Is it not appropriate that we askour friends to cooperate a little more fully in helping us maintain thatcapability?[S16MY8-654]{S5941}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, I share that with the Senator from Alaska. Indeed,that is one of the reasons I have attempted at this time to vote for hisamendment. But I just do not want this amendment interpreted as being sortof a critical attack on Kuwaitis' participation thus far in our overallgulf operations.Indeed, I think they should have in the past facilitated some of our merchantmarine interests and hopefully will do so in the future. But the recordshould reflect that they are participating like the other Gulf States inquiet ways, and in some way overt ways to the facilitation of our militar<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> activities in that area.[S16MY8-655]{S5941}EXONMr. EXON addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.[S16MY8-656]{S5941}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, I will be making a tabling motion although I donot wish to cut off debt prematurely on the Senator from Alaska.I am wondering if we might facilitate the movement ahead of the bill andbegin to clear the deck on the other very important matters that have beendiscussed by entering into a time agreement with the Senator from Alaskat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ha<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t we would agree not to table if he would agree tosay 5 minutes additional time equally divided, 5 minutes controlled bythe Senator here in opposition, and <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>5<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> minutes additional for any rebuttal or further statementsthat the Senator from Alaska could make. At that time I would move to table,and ask for the yeas and nays.Would some arrangement like that be satisfactory? I am not proposing itnow. I am asking the Senator from Alaska if some accommodation along thoselines would be acceptable to him. (Mr. REID assumed the chair.) [S16MY8-657]{S5941}MURKOWSKIMr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend from Nebraska. I remind the Chair that when initially we were discussing the proposedplan for the amendments, I had asked for an hour, equally divided, andthat seemed to have been agreeable. I understand that we are not under any firm commitment, but I had hopedthat the floor manager, the Senator from Georgia, and I could have a bitof <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>colloquy.I think what we are doing here is not an effort to criti<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ci<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ze the Kuwaitis, by any means, with regard to whatthey have done. They have done many things. They are doing more. By thesame token, when they come into a Senator's office and suggest that thereason they did not use American vessels with American crews is simplythe economics; when we recognize the commitment of our Navy, the fact thatwe have lost already a number of men on the<T3> Stark</T3> and we have lost two men in the helicopter that went down;and they communicate to us that their concern is that, ``Our economicsare not favorable enough''; when we have 25,000 union personnel ready togo to work and they are excluded from participating in the carriage ofoil_I do not want to sound mercenary in the sense that this is a commercialenterprise in the Persian Gulf, but let us recognize that without the U.S.Navy escorting all friendly nations, there would not be any commercialactivity in the Persian Gulf. I can understand the merits of the British and the Soviets using theirvessels and their crews, but I cannot understand the lack of commitmentby this administration and, very frankly, by my colleagues on the meritsof not urging the Kuwaitis to go out and charter some American vesselsthat were built with taxpayers' money, where we have already done the repairs,and they backed out because they said it was not economical. I think wewould be sending a devastating signal. [S16MY8-658]{S5942}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, I am not trying to cut off the Senator from Alaska.I asked him a question, and I have not received an answer to the question.I received more of the same that I have been listening to with great interestfor about a half hour. The question of the Senator from Nebraska_as long as I have the floor_isthat I would very much appreciate a response from my dear friend and colleaguefrom Alaska: Is he interested in a time agreement now, before I move totable the amendment, before I lost my right to the floor?

I think it is important that we move ahead. I want to give theSenator from Alaska an opportunity to make any points he can. I think hehas made some pretty good points.I simply propose, in connection with the previous arrangement that wassuggested, that there be 5 minutes of further debate, 10 minutes in total,equally divided, between the Senator from Nebraska and the Sen<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tor from Alaska, and that at the end of that time,which would be approximately 6:25, the time would expire, and at that timeI would be recognized for the purpose of making a tabling motion and askingfor the yeas and nays.I propose that unanimous consent agreement.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think that the Senator from Alaska has madea good point, but I think it is very wrong for the U.S. Senate to micromanagethe serious affairs in the gulf. Certainly, the President of the UnitedStates and the administration have full authority to do what they wantright now, if that is what the administration thinks is in the best interestsof carrying on our policy in the gulf.I would simply say that the bottom line of this amendment, as well meaningas it is_and I certainly understand the frustration and appeciate the frustrationof the Senator from Alaska, when the Kuwaitis tell him what they obviouslydid in his office, and I believe him. We have had less than total cooperationfrom the beginning from some of our allies in the gulf on a whole seriesof matters, not only who is going to sail their tankers, to carry theiroil out of their country, under our protection.I simply say that I think what we would be doing if we were to accept thesense-of-the-Senate resolution offered by the Senator from Alaska wouldbe to put even more Americans in harm's way. If a Kuwaiti tanker is sunknow, even if that tanker is under the protection of the United States Navy,I cannot see how it would improve the situation to have 5, 10, 15, or 20more Americans on that particular ship, even though they are God-fearingand unafraid American seamen.I think one of the real problems with the gulf today, if we want to attackit, and I have not, is that there is too much money and economics involvedin that war, a<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> there always is in war, without enough considerationfor the human sacrifices being made, especially by the men and women ofthe U.S. Navy who are there today, under great risk to themselves.The amendment clearly would get us more involved in the gulf, with a higherrisk of more American lives. I suggest that with all the other complicationswe have, this is not a step that is wise for us to take at this time.I again emphasize that I can appreciate the concerns of the Senator fromAlaska. He has been a very able and determined supporter of the rightsof American seamen, which we all endorse. I think we all join in this concern.I just feel that on the Defense authorization bill, we should not be tellingthe administration that they should see to it that the Kuwaitis put moreAmerican seamen on Kuwaiti vessels that are already at risk. It makes nosense to me, despite the fact that I wish we had more jobs for our seamenand our merchant marine.Mr. President, I emphasize that the administration has the authority todo what the Senator from Alaska is proposing in this sense-of-the-Senateresolution. Therefore, it would have no effect in law. It would have theeffect, I suggest, of the U.S. Senate further micromanaging the already-troubledsituation in the gulf.I <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>w<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ould simply say that I do not believe that the interestsof the United States overall would be served with the adoption of thisamendment.Mr. President, I move to table the amendment offered by the Senator fromAlaska.[S16MY8-667]{S5942}MURKOWSKIMr. MURKOWSKI.

I am about to make a tabling motion andI do not want anything to get in the way of that.Now, if there is a request to withdraw the amendment and if we could savethe tabling motion I would be fully reasonable and wait for that particularpurpose.Is there a request for me from either one of my colleagues, without losingmy right to the floor? I ask the question of my colleagues without losingmy right to the floor. Is there a request at this time that I would beglad to yield for the purpose of withdrawing the amendment? I am glad toyield for an answer to my question from the Senator from Alaska withoutlosing my right to the floor.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska yields to the Senatorfrom Alaska for a question.[S16MY8-674]{S5943}MURKOWSKIMr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.I ask a question: In view of the point that our colleague from Nebraskabrought up on the idea of micromanaging, nobody wants to micromanage theresponsibilities of the administration, but I am sure my friend would agreethat the matter of having a strong domestic maritime industry and a strongmerchant marine is important. When we have an opportunity to participatein some area of the world, why, I am sure my colleague would agree thatit is appropriate that we also have tankers and well-experienced merchantmariners to carry that oil. And while I appreciate his consideration forputting them in harm's way, none of us want to see that, but we also haveour Navy over there.So, my purpose was to send a message to Kuwait. I think the message hasbeen sent with the dialog that has taken place.It would be the intention of the Senator from Alaska to recognize a parliamentaryprocedure to withdraw the current pending sense-of-the-Senate resolutionwith the intention of perhaps seeing what the Kuwaitis' response was toutilizing American vessels that might be available for hire and Americanmerchant sailors.So, I would ask my colleague from Nebraska if he would agree to a unanimousconsent withdrawing the amendment by the Senator from Alaska at this time,with the clear intent that the Senator from Alaska would look to see whatwould take place during the next few weeks to see if this colloquy hashad any impression whatsoever on the Government of Kuwait to become moreinvolved in utilizing American vessels and American seamen?<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S16MY8-675]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5943}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>EXON<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. EXON.

Since he is not available at this time andmy friend, Senator <T4> Exon,</T4> is very well versed on this issue, I would like to engagehim in a short colloquy in expressing my concerns about the issue of titleIV of the DOD Reorganization Act which is that requiring certain toursof duty in joint staff by officers of the military in order to be eligiblefor promotion. I would like to start out by saying that Senator <T4>Nunn</T4> and his staff, the distinguished majority staff, have workedlong and hard on this issue, and I am very appreciative of their efforts.Mr. Punaro and Mr. Locher are very aware of the gravity of this situationand have worked in conjunction with DOD and our House colleagues in tryingto make some changes which in this Senator's view are much needed. Mr. President, this issue deserves special attention. I think that thereforms that were made in the Defense Authorization Act, the so-calledGoldwater-Nickles Act are very, very important, but I did not think theychange the basic structure of the original act. I believe, in my view, that the act is far too complex and micromanagesthe promotion of our officers in a way that interferes with combat assignments,forces early selection for flag rank, and is producing real hostility <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> join<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> duty tours, which is exactly the opposite from whatwe intended. We do <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ot want the military officers to view joint dutyas a punishment tour. We want it to be a tour of learning and experiencewhich would qualify them for higher command. This act still requires tours of duty that are far too long. A 2-year minimumassignment does not mean that tours are only 2 years long, but it getsrid of major personnel perturb<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tion. The <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>cu<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rrent tours not only create major problems in termsof their length but require special training. They do not recognize service in many forms of joint combat action suchas Libya or Persian Gulf. They force the officers who are not selected into longer tours. This canpresent serious problems in many areas, such as extended overseas dutyor sea duty. The net result does not lead to an improved officer corps,but a force ticket-punching for many officers that <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>has <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>just the opposite result of what the act intends.I understand the strong feeling of some Members of the House on this issuebut, in moving towa<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>rd<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, conference, I think we need to do everything possibleto ensure that all of the reforms suggested in this year's <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>De<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>fense <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>A<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>uthorization <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>A<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ct are agreed to by the House. I think we also needto move towa<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>rd<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> a much simple<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> bill based on 2-year tours of duty. I think thiswould accomplish all the intentions of the original act and make any jointduty meaningful and popular. My point, I say to my colleague from Nebraska, is joint duty is necessaryto prepare people for positions of major command and in the decisionmakingprocess. What I am afraid we did in a very zealous and well-intentionedeffort in the Goldwater-Nickles Act was basically micromanage to such adegree that throughout the officer<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> corps<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> now some of this duty is being viewed as punishmentrather than an opportunity to learn and <ITAG tagnum="80">advance. </ITAG>I am pleased at some of the changes that have been made in the authorizationbill. I hope my friend from Nebraska, who will play an important role inthe conference, will agree, along with the chairman, to try to bring aboutthe changes that are in our bill and convince our House colleagues of theimportance of it.I appreciate the indulgence and understanding of my colleague, Senator<T4>Exon</T4>.[S16MY8-693]{S5944}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, the direct answer to my friend and colleague fromArizona is, yes, we do understand. I have discussed it with the chairmanof the committee, Senator <T4>Nunn</T4>. We had, as he has properly alluded to, extensive discussionsin the Armed Services Committee on this very point.It has been the Senator from Arizona, I wish to say, who has been the pointman, so to speak. We have listened to him extremely carefully on this becausethere is no one in the Armed Services Committee who has <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>had<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the duty in the Navy under some of the most extremeconditions ever, both in command and <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>in c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ontrol, and a man who <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>did<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> work his way through, through his own efforts, theNavy and served with great distinction. We are all very proud of what hedid. Therefore, we listened very carefully to the legi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>tim<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ate discussions and points that were made by my friendand colleague from Arizona.I would point out, as I know he will agree, that we in our bill <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>came <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>forth with every request that the Department of Defensehad made with regard to further improvement or fine<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> tu<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ning, as I think we might call them, on the historicGoldwater-Nickles Department of Defense reauthorization bill. We believethat further discussions and thought processes should go forward in thisarea.There has not been total unanimity in the Armed Services Committee <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>about<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> shortening some tours of duty. But I, as one memberof the committee, thoroughly endorse the concept that is the driving force,I believe, behind the actions taken by my colleague from Arizona, and thatis to not have our tours of duty and rules for promotion so strict andso arcane that they do harm to the service and the people that serve inthat service with great distinction.So I simply thank my friend from Arizona for bringing this up.

[S16MY8-694]{S5944}McCAINMr. <T4>McCAIN. </T4>Mr. President, I thank my friend for his kind remarksand understanding of what is a very important issue to all of us, especiallyto the officer corps in all branches of our military.I also think it is well to point out that if we as a committee and if weas a body are going to act in a correct and mature fashion, we need bettersignals and a more coherent position from the Joint Chiefs. I think someof the confusion that the staff will attest to was generated by the factthat we were receiving mixed signals from the Joint Chiefs and from theDepartment of Defense itself which, in my view, created some needless differencesof opinion. I hope, in the intervening time, we can get a clear signalas to an agreed upon position from the Department of Defense which includesthe chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the members of the Joint Chiefs ofStaff. So I thank my colleague again for his support and understanding of thisvery important issue, along with the staff and the distinguished chairmanof the committee.[S16MY8-695]{S5944}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, I could not agree more that a classic case hasbeen evidenced in this particular episode by the fact that the Joint Chiefsand the Department of Defense have not gotten their act together. That,more than anything else, I think, complicated final disposition of thismatter in the Armed Services Committee.I repeat again, we will take a further look at this. I think it will bea very interesting discussion. Hopefully, we can come out of the conferencewith something more along the line that the Senator from Arizona has inmind.Mr. President, I yield the floor.Mr. President, what is present parliamentary situation?

Repressive steps taken by the Sandinistagovernment clearly indicate that they are not interested in pursuing ina realistic fashion negotiations toward a cease-fire and reintegrationof the Contras into their society. They feel, and I am sure correctly,that the Contras are dramatically weakened and they will be able to prevail.Let me just give you a quote carried in the New York Times today by PresidentDaniel Ortega Saavedra:[S16MY8-705]{S5945}<ITAG tagnum="21">The general's older brother said in a recent speech that talks withthe Contras would have a limited agenda.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">They think we are willing to discuss if there is going to be a revolutionaryprocess or a counterrevolutionary process here, President Ortega said.This is not up for discussion.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">What we are discussing is how the mercenary forces who are alreadydefeated can lay down their weapons.

I think we may have a further amendment. So I willnot take a lot of time. The fact is that in the eyes of the Contras andthe rest of Central America this body_the other body, actually_has abandonedthe Contras to the unseemly fate of the unwanted.

We now see that they inte<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d to continue the course of the Marxist revolution.And the tragedy of all of this is that someday, Mr. President, we may berequired to intervene militarily and use <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>N<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>orth American troops for wh<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>at<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the Contra troops were doing pretty well; that is,fighting for freedom against an expansionist, Marxist, odious regime whichhas taken its nation into the depths of poverty and the depths of repressionand oppression by a ruthless people who have betrayed the revolution.With that I suggest the absense of a quorum.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.[S16MY8-706]{S5945}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for thequorum call be rescinded.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.[S16MY8-707]{S5945}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. Mr. President, I was here on the floor and heard my distinguishedcolleague from Arizona make what I thought were so<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>me<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> very accurate and succinct points with respect tothe so-called peace initiative in Central America. I think it is well toremember that we heard these same, same cries back in the seventies. Thatwas ``Give peace a chance.'' It has a nice ring to it.We gave peace a chance in C<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mbodia and South Vietnam, and the Sen<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>at<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>or from Arizona is absolutely correct. If that isthe kind of peace we are going to give <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> our fellow Americans in Centr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>al <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>America, Nicaraguans, then I think that the greatestbastion of freedom on Earth<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I do not know what it will take for this Congressor a new Congress to recognize that Daniel Ortega and Tomas Borge and theother commandantes are no different from any of the rest of the Marxist-Leninistbandits that roam this Earth. They are no different, Mr. President.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The quote of Mr. Ortego should be a message thatis strong enough for us Americans to recognize. When he says, ``They arelucky they did not get the guillotine or the firing squad, that is whatthey deserved,'' what he is saying is the only<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> re<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ason we did not give them the guillotine or firingsquad is because we are trying to stall off the support that Congress wasgiving to the contras.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>In other words, it is manipulating U.S. foreign policy.I guess what saddens this Senator so much is that many of us were hereon this floor predicting that this would be the outcome, predicting thatwould happen. Eventually, sooner or later, if the Marxist-Leninist commanda<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nt<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>es are allowed to stay in power, they will consolidatethat power; they will surround the Contras; they will ultimately kill theContras, the freedom fighters that were friends of the United States andwere fighting for not only their freedom, but for our freedom and for freedom,you might say, for all Americans in the North and South American Continent.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>That is really what the issue is all about. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> think the Senator from Arizona is probably correct.It saddens this Senator to think about it. We will probably be asking_wewill be forced to do it, maybe not this President but the next President_touse American, U.S. American, boys to fight a battle that the NicaraguanAmerican boys were fighting with our help. And they were doing well atit.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>They had established command and control of theiroperations. They had established the ability to do large scale operationsin the country. They were gaining control of the countryside. Many of thoseleaders that I talked to said that within a year they would have had Managuasurrounded and had complete control of the countryside in Nicaragua.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>They had support of 85 percent of the populationof the Nicaraguan people. When the Senator from Arizona and I visited withCardinal Obando y Bravo we asked him the question: How many people in Nicaraguado you believe support the Contras? He said at least 85 percent; withoutbatting an eye.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Yet we come here to this Congress and we could neverget the support for those people that had the support of the people fromthe countryside in Nicaragua.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>So, now, Mr. President, we have made the situationworse, not better. Our options are less, not more.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>We have tied the hands of the administration; wehave tied the hands of the freedom fighters. We weakened the position thatwe were in. We made it more difficult to deal in the future.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I say, once again, as is all too often the case,the United States of America is preparing to snatch defeat from the jawsof victory. People may say it is not important, but it is important. If,in fact, the Soviets and the Cubans are able to ensconce another Sovietsatellite nation in the mainland of the Americas_and they have done it,so to speak, in defiance of the United States of America, they have madeus weaker, made them stronger, and they also give an outlet for the peoplein neighboring Panama to start strengthening their hand.The people say: ``Well, it doesn't matter if Nicaragua is a Communist country.''I wonder if it will matter to those same people if Panama becomes a Communistcountry some day as that revolution is exported, or up to Mexico if weget a revolution going there? At what point will we be forced to committroops, American troops, U.S. troops? That is really what the issue andquestion<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> is<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>.  It is unfortunate, I think, that this continues to go on. Every day thereis another report of the situation deteriorating either economically orpolitically, and also from the standpoint of human rights in Nicaragua.The situation<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> is<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> deteriorating on a daily basis. [S16MY8-708]{S5946}McCAINMr. M<T4>c</T4>CAIN. Will my friend yield? [S16MY8-709]{S5946}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. I will be happy to. [S16MY8-710]{S5946}McCAINMr. <T4>McCAIN.</T4> First I would like to say my friend's remarks are extremelyaccurate and very important. I think it is important that he and I, andperhaps our distinguished friend from North Carolina and others, even thoughour cause may be lost in Nicaragua, in Central America, I think it is importantthat we make a record and remind this body frequently as to what is happeningas we watch the situation degenerate into one of continued oppression,repression, and eventually the increased subversion of the neighbors ofthe country of Nicaragua, which goes on as we speak. Once the Contras areneutralized, in my view, it cannot help but be dramatically increased.Let me also make a comment about a mutual friend of ours who has workedat the White House and before who worked for our distinguished former Ambassadorto the United Nations, Jose Sorzano. According to press reports I readthis mo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>rn<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ing, Mr. Sorzano is going to resign his positionwhich he has held as an assistant to General Powell in the White Housein working on Latin American affairs.  According to press reports, Mr. Sorzano is resigning because of his frustrationwith our inability to address this very difficult issue.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Fi<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rst of all, I would like to say I owe the highestrespect and regard for Mr. Sorzano and the outstanding and dedicated workhe has done for many years. I think not only I, but many Americans, arevery appreciative of what he has done.I would also like to remind my friend, Jose So<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>zano, that it is very difficult for the administrationto act if it is clear that there is no way that the House of Representativeswill approve military aid. And that, I believe, was the originator of thebeginning of the deterioration of the Sandinistas as a fighting force.Unfortunat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ely<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, we see that continue to this day.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ield back to my friend from Idaho.[S16MY8-711]{S5946}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. I want to say I concur with the comments the Senator from Arizonamade about Mr. Sorzano at the White House.I might say the unfortunate part of it is that most of the people who havebeen in and out of the White House over these past many years who have<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>had a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> clearcut position on this issue have been frustrated,either frustrated by the inability early on of the administration to declareitself clearly to the American people on the issue or the Congress to <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>fa<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>il to declare itself clearly. Many of them have movedon to other endeavors.Of course, the Senator from Arizona makes the comment that it may be alost cause. I would say most likely freedom is never a lost cause, whetherit be in Nicaragua or the Soviet Union. As long as the pulse of libertycan beat in some people's veins, somewhere, sometime people will wake upand support those who are endeavoring to be free because it is only naturalthat people should live freely on this Earth.I yield the floor.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question now is on agreeing to the amendmentof the Senator from North Carolina.[S16MY8-726]{S5947}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, can we suspend for one moment?Mr. President, I think it ought to be stated what the modification is briefly.This is still an amendment that expresses strongly the Senate's concernabout a possibility of armed forces of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,Cuba, or Nicaragua.

Mr. President, in the Armed Services Committee we had a lengthydiscussion on the matter at hand.We have had considerable discussion yesterday and again today. I am pleasedto report that all sides involved in this have come to the agreement thatwe will satisfy the present problems we have in this area by the simpleintroduction of the one amendment that has just been sent to the desk.It has been agreed to I believe on both sides.In addition thereto, a colloquy will follow. We will correct some of thereport language in the bill in this regard. Essentially, all we are doingis moving up a requested report that the Armed Services Committee has madeof the Department. That required report was originally in the report languagein the bill not to be accomplished before November 1, 1989. We will, bycolloquy, move that up to March 1, 1989.[S16MY8-752]{S5948}GLENNMr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kennedy amendment todelay construction funding for the special isotope separation [SIS] project.Mr. President, the amendment before the Senate would withhold funding forthe construction of an SIS facility until March 1, 1989, and would requirethe Secretary of Energy to submit before then a report to Congress on thestatus of the SIS technology. My reasons for supporting this amendmentare threefold:First, I am not convinced that there is or will be sufficient demand forplutonium to justify the SIS project.Second, even if such a demand does exist, it is premature to determinewhether the SIS technology is best suited to meeting that demand in a safeand economical manner.Third, I am concerned that funding of the SIS construction project woulddivert resources from safety improvements and environmental cleanup atthe defense production complex, a task of the utmost priority that willcost many tens of billions of dollars.DOE has repeatedly acknowledged that the United States now has a substantialsurplus of plutonium. Energy Secretary Herrington recently remarked that``we have more plutonium than we need,'' and Under Secretary Salgado h<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>as<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> seconded this assessment, commenting that a 2-yearmoratorium in plutonium production ``would not have a negative impact''on national security. With an INF agreement on the horizon and a STARTagreement under negotiation, the United States plutonium stockpile is likelyto grow. Even in the unlikely event that the United States should requireexpanded plutonium capacity before a new production reactor becomes operational,contingencies already exist. For example, DOE has stated that the HanfordN reactor is ``in a cold standby status, with the capability to restartif a national security need develops.''Mr. President, without an urgent mission for the SIS plant, it would beunwise to begin construction while laser isotope separation technologyis still i<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n th<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e research and development stage. Further groundworkis ncessary to determine whether SIS technology can be applied safely andefficiently on a production scale. For example, DOE has yet to completea <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>sa<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>fety analysis revi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ew<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> document for this project. Accordingly, this amendmentwould not affect funding for Randamp;D and design activities. Instead, itwould require the Secretary of Energy to report on the status of technologydevelopment before appropriated funds could be spent on construction.This makes sense in terms of health and safety not only at the proposedSIS<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> pl<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ant, but throughout the defense production complex.Rather than requesting a first installment on a multibillion dollar constructionproject that may prove unnecessary or unworkable, DOE should be gettinga start on its staggering environmental cleanup task. Under Secretary Salgadorecently estimated that cleanup costs at DOE facilities could run as highas $100 billion. A report giving a more careful estimate, with timetables,is scheduled to be delivered to me by DOE no later than July 1, 1988. Thisis the legacy of an agency that for decades ignored environmental and safetyproblems in the name of production. We can no longer allow Americans tobe placed increasingly at risk of being poisoned or irradiated by the veryindustry that is supposed to be protecting them from nuclear devastation.Mr. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>P<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>resident, I urge my colleagues to support the amendmentoffered by my colleague from Massachusetts, and to defer funding of theSIS plant until both the value and the safety of this proposed facilityhave been convincingly demonstrated.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>[S16MY8-753]{S5948}KENNEDYMr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the amendment that the senior <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Se<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nator from Ohio and I offer today would defer untilMarch 1, 1989, only those expenditures that would be used for actual sitepreparations for a new weapons plutonium production facility in Idaho calledthe special isotope separation plant [SIS] for short.This amendment would not affect any other aspect of the SIS developmentprogram, and the Secretary of Energy has stated that the provisions ofthis amendment <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>``wi<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ll not adversely impact the schedule of the SIS project.''I have discussed this amendment with the chairman and ranking minoritymember of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and with the chairman ofthe Strategic Subcommittee and the Senators from Idaho. We have also agreedthat the due date for the Secretary of Energy's report on the SIS plantshould be changed from November 1, 1989 to March 1, 1989.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>A similar amendment has already been adopted with broad bipartisan agreementby our colleagues in the House, because it represents a very modest andprudent limitation on the pace of this program, which to date has not receivedthe kind of congressional oversight it deserves. The agreement was workedout with the consent of the Department of Energy, interested parties inIdaho, and the substantial number of legislators who were seeking evenstronger action to halt the construction of this potentially high-riskfacility. The basic rationable for this amendment is that this body is not yet inpossession of sufficient information to evaluate the true costs and technicalrisks posed by the proposed<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> SIS plant. SIS technology involves the use of lasersto separate isotopes of hot vaporized plutonium in proximity to highlyf<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>la<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mmable hydrogen gas and ethanol. At present, thetechnology is unproven at a production scale.There is simply a lot we do not know today about how to operate such anSIS facility safely and economically. SIS technology is not rea<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>dy<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> for deployment in fiscal year 1989. Successful construction of a safe SIS production plant depends on the successof the production-scale technology demonstration program at the LivermoreNational Labor<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>at<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ory. This program is not even scheduled for completionuntil September 1989. Technical problems could delay that date even further.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>There is a disturbing and increasing degree of concurrency between theLivermore <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>D<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>evelopment <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>P<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rogram and construction of the SIS production plantat the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory [INEL]. Essential researchand development to demonstrate the feasibility of the production processis slipping into the outyears but construction is moving forward. Highlevels of development funding overlap construction funding at least through1990 and possibly beyond that date, depending on the results of the Livermoreproduction demonstration program.This pattern of expenditure is just the opposite of that expected for asuccessful development program entering the deployment stage.As most legislators are aware, concurrency invites cost escalation andpotentially disastrous technical problems. What the senior Senator fromOhio and I are suggesting, in effect, is that we fly this complicated technologybefore we buy it.A closely related and important issue is whether this body is in possessionof sufficient information to conclude that SIS technology can make thetransition to a production-scale plant capable of safe routine operations.The fundamental, indispensable document on this subject is the safety analysisreview [SAR] document.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>The Department of Energy has stated that a draft of this document <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>will not be completed until <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>September <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>1988. This body should not allow construction workon this plant to proceed without first examining the safety analsysis review[SAR] document.Another concern is the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>disposal <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>of radioactive wastes from the plant. The SIS plantis expected to generate 220 tons of long lived radioactive waste annually,but the anticipated disposal site for this waste is experiencing technical<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>difficulties, <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>and may not be able to accept it.Some mea<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>su<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>re of concurrency and increased technical risk mightbe justified in the SIS plant were being constructed to satisfy some urgentnational security requirement for weapons-<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>grade <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>plutonium. But as Energy Department officials readilyadmit, the SIS plant is not designed to meet a well identified near termneed.There is presently a surplus of <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>weapons-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>grade plutonium. Moreover, the windfall of plutoniumf<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ro<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>m INF weapon reductions will make available the equivalentof about 2 years production from the SIS plant, postponing the date atwhich the Nation might conceivably need to draw upon the output from thisproposed facility.Further, in the event of strategic reductions, the United States will havea plutonium surplus for an indefinite period, obviating the need for thebillion dollar investment in the proposed SIS plant.Given the adequacy of existing sources of <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>weapons-grade <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>plutonium through the late 1990's, there is no compellingneed to preempt the arms reduction process by rushing to build this additonalplutonium production capacity now.We have the time, Mr. President, and most important of all, we have theresponsibility to carefully evaluate both the need for an additional sourceof weapons plutonium and the risks of the untried SIS technology, beforewe embark on construction of an SIS production facility in Idaho or anyother location.I ask that a nu<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>mb<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>er of DOE statements on the SIS plant be in<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>clud<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ed in the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Record<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213> at this point.There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the<T4>Record</T4>, as follows:[S16MY8-754]{S5949}DOE Statem<ITAG tagnum="74">DOE Statements on SIS Plutonium</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``[T]he language of the amendments adopted in the House <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Armed <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Services Authorization Bill . . . will not adverselyimpact the schedule of the SID project.''

Mr. President, this amendment is quite similar to what we passedlast year. It has to do with a destroyer. We had a very vigorous debatethis morning on the issue. But basically we are not producing enough destroyers.The military, the Navy, requires at least five a year. We are now downto three for authorization. This is simply an amendment that, if fundsfrom prior years can be found, would allow the Appropriations Committeeto actually fund an additional one if they could come up with any funding.So it simply gives them the authority to act in the event that any priorsavings can be identified with additional destroyers. My understandingis it has the support of the chairman and the ranking member.[S16MY8-774]{S5950}NUNNMr. NUNN addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We have beenbuying, I understand, about five a year. This is what I was talking aboutthe other day when I mentioned that we are going to have to retire someaircraft carriers at some point I think not because of the ship fixationor because of any dogmatic rule about that, but simply to pay for the modernvessels that have to accompany the existing carriers.My understanding is that the fleet obsolescence on the destroyers is reallyoccurring more rapidly than other ships. Whether we are going to be ableto actually afford this one or not, we do not know. We had to make thechoice in the committee between an attack submarine and this destroyer.We felt that based on the existing funding that we know about we were notable to afford it. But the way this amendment is drawn, it would have tocome if it is going to be financed out of prior years' appropriations thatremain for obligation which may be transferred; in other words, if fundsare elapsed, and so forth.We know we need the ship. The Senator from Maine and the Senator from MississippiI know have conferred on this. I know they are very much in favor of movingthis.

E<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>veryone in this Chamber, as far as I know, and thePresident of the United States. Everyone that I know of is concerned aboutdemocracy in Panama, the Panama Canal, the people, drugs, whatever it is.There have been a lot of efforts to find some quick solution to get himto go, but they have not worked.Now there are reports that he has, in effect, been given a golden parachute,90-days' notice, and a lot of other things that this administration isbeing criticized for. But I think the important thing is that if we sendthis signal, it is going to undermine the so-called war on drugs.It was only on Friday of last week we decided to bring the military in,we are so concerned about it. So in a very limited basis, particularlyi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> surveillance and in some cases in arrest, we aregoing to extend more power to the military because we are concerned aboutthe war on drugs.So, I say, let Noriega go, but let us not send him off with a le<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>al golden parachute.I would hope that reports that are emanating from differe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t<ITAG tagnum="80">news sources as recently as the 7 o'clock <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>news <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>are incorrect.

But I wouldhope that as someone who has been a supporter of the administration_andI think my record is pretty good_they would understand the American peopleare never going to understand if we dismiss indictments on Noriega.Maybe there is a good reason for it. Maybe it can be explained in a secretsession. But I am not certain if it is ever going to be explained to thesatisfaction of someone in my State, or someone in the State of the PresidingOfficer, or someone in any other States whose children have become addictedto drugs that might have come from the efforts of General Noriega. We willnever be able to explain the profits he has made, the millions and millionsof dollars. Let us make no mistake about it. Ten years ago we discussedthe Panama Canal on this floor, the Panama Canal Treaty.I remember saying at least once, at least once mentioning Noriega's name10 years ago, along with General Torrijos and his brother, and we wereconcerned about drug traffic. The Senator from North Carolina, the recordwill show, indicated 10 years ago that Noriega was mixed up with drugs.So there is no big secret and I think the record will reflect that.So, I am joined in this amendment by Senator <T4>D'Amato <CODE-213>1</CODE-213></T4>and <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Senator<T4> Helms</T4> and Senator <T4>Thurmond</T4> and maybe others who have not been contacted. Not inan effort to derail a settlement or arrangement between the administrationand Noriega to get him out of power. We all want him to go. And maybe theadministration has tried everything. Maybe this is the last resort. Andsome will say, probably accurately, that the indictments are worthlessanyway. He is never going to be tried in this country.But they are a strong symbol to a lot of law-abiding citizens and millionsof people who are concerned about drugs, that we are not going to tolerateit.I am just fearful that by dismissing the indictments that strong symbolevaporates. I am not certain that is what we really want. There has gotto be some other way.Yet I do not quarrel with those who have been dealing with this on a dailybasis, trying to find a solution. We have tried economic sanctions, theydid not work. We tightened <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>up <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>sanctions, <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>they still did not work. Noriega seems to have gottenstronger.But I would hope and I know the Senator from New York has been active inthis area on a day-to-day basis for the past several weeks and as a cosponsorof the amendment. I yield the floor.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York, Senator <T4>D'Amato</T4>.[S16MY8-786]{S5951}D'AMATOMr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I want to applaud and thank the Senator fromKansas for taking a courageous stand; for not doing what is fashionableor easy. The easiest thing is for him to say nothing or certainly, nothingpublicly. It is not easy for the former majority leader, the leader onthe Republican side, to differ with the administration in a public way.But sometimes you have got to stand up and make a stand for what you knowis right, what is important for this country. That is what Senator <T4>Dole</T4> has done now.Mr. President, a case could be made, I believe, that if Noriega were legi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ti<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mately going to give up power, if the Panama defenseforces would come under the control of someone who would not use them tocontinue a criminal drug enterprise, if true democracy in the fullnessof time could be guaranteed, then an argument could be made that this indeedis analogous to plea bargaining. Mr. President, that is not the case. Noriega is not called upon to giveup any power. This is a ruse, a facade, a sham. And it is scandalous.What we are doing is rewarding him. We are giving him a pardon. And forthat he says, ``Well, come August, I will leave the country on a littletrip.''There is nothing in this agreement that would preclude him from comingback the day after the pardon is issued, the day after the indictmentsare dismissed with prejudice.Mr. President, let me suggest to you what that means. Once the indictmentis dismissed, it can never be brought again. That is a pretty good deal.That is, indeed, a ``golden parachute.'' I never heard of that kind ofdeal in any court in this land, let alone for a fellow who has killed,who has murdered, who has robbed, who subverted his people, the constitution,who presents a very real danger to this Nation and our national securityas it relates to the Panama Canal and the Cubanization that is taking placein Panama; a man who has trafficked and money laundered for the carteland made hundreds of millions of do<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>lars on the misery and death that is taking placein our Nation. And we talk about a war on drugs.What kind of message are we sending?I want to tell you, there are some people downtown who had better wakeup. They have got Potomac fever. They do not really understand what istaking place throughout the length and breadth of this Nation. They donot even understand what is taking <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>place <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>in the city of Washington, where we see death andmayhem.I want to ask you, how do you get tough with the drug dealer after youallow this for this killer, an indicted felon? There are U.S. attorneyswho dedicated their lives to law enforcement who have said ``we will resignrather than go along with this kind of thing.''We have to put our hope in the fact that maybe a judge will do an unprecedentedthing. A Federal judge, who will be called upon to agree with the dismissal,may say no. Those great political pundits who are making these assumptions had bettertake a look at that because I think this Federal judge has the courageto look at all these things and to say, ``what kind of an example is this?Demonstrate to me how it is in the national security interest that youare going to allow this.'' Because that is what the Federal Governmentwill be in the national interest. How?When Noriega can handpick his own successor as the head of the army? Where,mythically, we are going to say, ``Oh, no, President Delvalle is the fellowwho we respect. He is the President.''But when Delvalle has called upon us to ask for extradition, we have noteven had the courage and the sense to ask for that extradition.Well, Mr. President, how will any nation take us seriously? How will theyrespect us? What will they understand when the United States makes a commitment?If you were looking for freedom, and to break the chains of tyranny, couldyou count on the United States? When we encourage President Delvalle totake the action he did, to fire this dictator, this murderer, this drugdealer, and then we abandon him and, more importantly, the millions ofPanamanians who looked to us?How will any nation ever think that the word of the United States is onethat you can put your faith and your trust in?How will this rightfully be interpreted by the political process, by thejournalists, by everyone else? I suggest that this administration is doingitself in.Personally, I would rather see a ``poison pill'' than the ``golden parachute''in this case. That would be more appropriate.Let me suggest that we are making a mockery of our own laws. It is a sadday in this country if we continue to pursue this.I do have a hope because, Mr. President, I still have a deep and abidingfaith in a wonderful man. He is a wonderful man, a decent man and a goodman. He has been courageous and led this Nation over unprecedented economicand worldwide difficulties; and he has been successful. That is RonaldReagan, our President. He is a man who listens to the American people.I do not think the American people want us to drop these charges and togive testimony, indeed, to the effectiveness of the drug cartel and ManuelNoriega. I think they would rather see that we do what is right: to sayto Manuel Noriega, we are going to pursue these charges, we are going todo that which we must to keep faith both with the Panamanian people whoseek freedom and democracy, and with our own national security interests.I hope the American public lets our President know that they oppose a sellout<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>, <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>and any dropping of th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>se charges; that they call the White House, thatthey write to the White House, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>and <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>let our President know, because I think there aresome people around him who are just not letting him know what the realfacts are.I have great faith in our President. I think once he knows and once hehears the way the American people feel and once he gets all of the facts,he is not going to permit this to take place: The dropping of the chargesagainst a drug-dealing dictator, giving him, in essence, a free hand topick his success<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ors;<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> continuing the subservience of the Pa<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>amanian people to the drug cartel; and saying tothe whole world that the United States does not have the will, the ability,the wherewithal<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>, <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>or the moral stamina to meet its commitments.Thank you, Mr. President.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week I ma<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>de<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> a statement on the amendment of the Senator fromPennsylvania [Mr. <T4>Heinz</T4>]. A section of that statement was inadvert<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ntly omitted. A corrected copy is as follows:Mr. President, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> rise in strong support of the amendment of the Senatorfrom Pennsylvania.The amendment will strike sections 808 and 916 of the bill. The provisionsunwisely repeal two sections of current law. Our amendment would simplyrestore current law.As reported to the Senate<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>, t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>he Department of Defense authorization bill wouldoverturn a public policy of 40 years which recognizes the national interestof retaining a portion of Government contracts of our domestic industries.This is a serious matter of national security.Military contracts are critical in maintaining our industrial base. Wehave kept that industrial base viable by ensuring that a significant p<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>er<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>centage of these contracts stay here at home. Withoutthat reserved portion, that percentage, we will become more and more dependenton foreign sources for our<ITAG tagnum="80">own military defense. And that, Mr. President, is simply unacceptable.</ITAG>I do not believe the American people will tolerate a situation where webecome more and more dependent for key military components upon countrieswhich may not prove to be reliable allies_or maybe not even allies at all.Take specialty steel, for example. This industry provides the specializedcomponents needed for today's sophisticated weapons systems. It is a hightech and very competitive industry. In the past few years, the industryhas adjusted and streamlined its operations to compete in the modern worldmarketplace. Yet, the industry still faces unfair trading practices fromsteel producing countries.If the Gramm provision remains in the DOD authorization bill, it will givethese foreign companies an unbeatable advantage in bidding on Governmentcontracts and reward them for their unfair trading practices. That willundo the progress that has been made over the past few years in modernizingthe specialty steel industry and will result in a decline in the industryitself_not because it is inefficient but because it is being outbid bycompanies with an unfair price advantage.It is not only hi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>gh<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>-tech industries which will suffer from the workingsof these provisions of the bill, however. Many comp<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>an<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ies in the textile and apparel industries rely onmilitary uniform contracts. Yet it is clear that if the Gramm amendmentremains in the bill, our textile industry will be unable to outbid countrieswhose textile and apparel industries pay sweatshop wages.That will inevitably lead to a further decline in the industry's productioncapacity. In fact, the import penetration rate for textiles and apparelis already 52 percent. The industry is reaching a point where once factoriesare closed it will be extremely difficult to restart production and findenough trained workers to expand production.Think of that, Mr. President. We are looking at a real prospect that wewill not have the capacity to produce enough uniforms for our Armed Forces.Those of us who represent States with a significant textile industry haveseen the devastating imp<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ct that textile imports have already had on the communitiesin our States. Many such facilit<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ie<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s are located in rural areas_areas which have fewalternative employment opportunities. As I travel around Tennessee, I constantlysee the effects of imports on our citizens. I talk to individuals who havelost their jobs in the communities where they have lived and worked foryears. We should not add to the harm already being done to these communities.Another industry that would be seriously affected by the Gramm languageis the coal industry. Over the past few years, we have established a publicpolicy of converting our domestic defense facilities to coal, where thatis cost-effective. That current law also sets targets for coal purchasesof 1.3 million tons of bituminous coal and 300 tons of anthracite coal. Last year the Department of Defense bought 1.6 million tons of coal fordomestic use. Those sales provided a needed boost to an industry whichis critical to our defense base. It is, however, an industry characterized by wide economic swings. Today,there is widespread recession in the industry. Large numbers of minersare unemployed. Our <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>coal<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> industry does not need to be cut any further. Wemust maintain a healthy coal industry for defense purposes. The coal industry <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>has <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>also been crucial to the development of many communitiesin my State of Tennessee_particularly in <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ast <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ennessee. When the industry is facing hard times,as it is now, it can have a devastating impact on a community. A coal companyis often by far the largest employer and taxpayer in an area. A portionof the 1.6 million tons of the coal DOD purchased last year came from Tennessee.For many companies and many communities that was the difference betweengood times and bad times. Finally, there is one more factor here. It is now clear that the President,despite bipartisan urging to the contrary, is going to veto the trade bill.That is bad enough. But, with that in mind, now is not the time to senda signal to our trading partners that it is open season on the domesticindustries of this country. We simply must, in our own national interest, keep the means of militaryproduction in our own hands. So, I call on my colleagues to join us inpassing this amendment.[S16MY8-791]{S5952}base closu<ITAG tagnum="89">base closure implementation provisions</ITAG>[S16MY8-792]{S5952}BURDICKMr. <T4>BURDICK. </T4>Mr. President, there are two provisions concerning closureand realignment of military installations that are troubling from an environmentalviewpoint. Specifically, provisions of the National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 are explicitly waived with respect to base closures and a furtherprovision appears to make environmental restoration at closed militaryinstallations a discretionary activity. I seek clarification from the distinguishedchairman of the Armed Service Committee on the intent of these provisions.[S16MY8-793]{S5952}NUNNMr. <T4>NUNN. </T4>I am happy to respond to the concerns of the chairman andmembers of the Environment and Public Works Committee. [S16MY8-794]{S5952}BURDICKMr. <T4>BURDICK. </T4>While I generally support the objectives of the base-closingprovisions, I have strong reservations about the NEPA waiver. NEPA servesas the national policy and conscience on actions that affect the environment.To simply exempt base closures from NEPA procedures in this case may beunwarranted and sets a bad precedent. NEPA procedures explicitly providefor categorical exemptions of actions which do not individually or cumulativelyhave a significant effect on the environment. Further, as drafted, this provision could be interpreted to exempt propertyconveyance and future uses of this sites from NEPA in addition to baseclosure actions. If NEPA is waived, in cases were an environmental impactstatement on a base-closing decision otherwise would have been required,potentially serious environmental consequences could escape review by themilitary, relevant Federal and State agencies and the public, only to beuncovered when the property is conveyed to an unsuspecting community. The second issue of concern is the provision addressing environmental restorationissues. Is the intent of this provision to in any way relieve the Departmentof Defense of responsibilities under current environmental stat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tes including Superfund and the Solid Waste DisposalAct?[S16MY8-795]{S5953}NUNNMr. <T4>NUNN. </T4>No. I assure my colleague that this provision in no wayinterferes with military compliance with applicable environmental statutesexcept for NEPA. Section 923 as amended waives four statutes: the FederalProperty and Administrative Services Act of 1949 which relates to propertydisposal; the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 which relates tothe need to file an environmental impact statement; and two reporting requirements;10 U.S.C. 2662 and 10 U.S.C. 2687; and any provision of law restrictingthe use of funds for closing or aligning military installations includedin appropriations or authorization acts other than this act. Those statutesrelated to other environmental concerns would remain fully in effect. The chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee has raised somelegitimate issues with respect to the NEPA waiver. The House has expressedsimilar reservations on this <ITAG tagnum="80">point as well. I stand willing to work with my colleagues on the Environment<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>and Public Works Committee to address this matterin the conference on the bill. </ITAG>[S16MY8-796]{S5953}MITCHELLMr. MITCHELL. As the Senator knows, military installations may harbor someof the most serious hazardous waste problems in this Nation. Accordingly,the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, commonly referredto as SARA, contains extensive Federal facility hazardous waste managementrequirements. Section 120 spells out Federal Government responsibilitiesfor identifying hazardous waste problems, responding to those problemsand documenting compliance. Can the chairman of the Armed Services Committeeassure me that the proposed base closure provisions will not affect militarycompliance with section 120 of SARA and applicable provisions of the SolidWaste Dispo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>al Act? [S16MY8-797]{S5953}NUNNMr. NUNN. The intent of the provision in the bill is not to relieve theresponsibility of DOD to comply with the requirements of se<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tion 120 of Superfund or the Solid Waste Dispo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>al Act. [S16MY8-798]{S5953}MITCHELLMr. MITCHELL. I remain concerned about the implications of this provisionfor future uses of closed military facilities. It seems to suggest thatrestoration of the property is purely discretionary. I want to make surethat when and if closure of military facilities occurs it is handled responsiblyand that the rights of potential owners of closed sites are protected.[S16MY8-799]{S5953}NUNNMr NUNN. I give my assurances to the Senator that this provision will notchange or alter existing liability and cleanup responsibilities under currentlaw. [S16MY8-800]{S5953}MITCHELLMr. MITCHELL. Further, I share the concerns of my colleagues about exemptionfrom NEPA. NEPA has proven to be a useful tool in protecting the environment.Application of NEPA is an essential part of our system of environmentalprotection and should be applied in the case of base closures.

I want to assoc<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ate myself with the concerns of my colleagues regardingresponsibilities of DOD under Superfund and RCRA, and I also want to registermy strong objection to the blanket waiver from the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act that section 923 grants to any activities enumerated in thatsection. The activities that would be exempt from NEPA extend not only to the decisionto close a base, but to ``all actions necessary to implement such closureor realignment, including acquiring land, constructing replacement facilities,relocating activities, and conducting advance planning and design.'' Thisis a sweeping exemption applicable to activities that, by their own terms,could have very significant effects on the environment. I understand that, in the past, litigation under NEPA may have been usedto delay base closures without any real regard to environmental concerns.Perhaps I am overly optimistic, but I believe that a provision might befashioned to limit abuses of the NEPA process with regard to base closureswithout sacrificing <ITAG tagnum="80">NEPA's safeguards for actions that have potentially significant effectson the environment.</ITAG>Since the Environment and Public Works Committee has jurisdiction overNEPA, I would hope there will be an opportunity for us to work with membersof the Armed Services Committee on crafting such a provision before thebill is finally enacted by the Congress.[S16MY8-802]{S5953}BAUCUSMr. BAUCUS.

I personally do not have the informationshowing that NEPA has been a major hindrance with respect to base closures.I have requested additional information on this matter and am willing toconsider options to correct problems if they exist. NEPA does not automaticallyrequire an environmental impact statement for every Federal action. Thereare procedures for categorical exclusions and less detailed environmentalassessments.

As anyone will understand who can rememberfreshman calculus_or who has tried to water the back of a garden with ahose that's too short_you get the maximum range from a relatively highi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>itial angle of fire. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">1For ballistic missiles, that is an angle of about 40 degrees to theEarth. The result is that they fly far above the atmosphere, followinga long, lofted course to their target. The time to takes to reach thattarget is about 13 minutes, even from a submarine close to our shores.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">1Those 13 minutes, desperately short as they may be, are critical tothe effectiveness of our deterrent. Continual flying is too expensive forAmerican nuclear bombers to stay in the air constantly. (The Soviets don'tuse airborne alert either.) The 13-minute submarine-missile flight time,moreover, makes airborne alert unnecessary. Intelligence sensors_basedin satellites that watch the oceans constantly_can detect the intense heatof the submarine missile rockets and warn the bombers to take off. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">1There is, however, a way to beat this system.

By firing at a lowerelevation, so that the missile will fly at a ``depressed trajectory,' aclose-in submarine could hit U.S. bomber bases in five minutes, too shorta time for the bombers to get clear. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">1The potential for using depressed-trajectory missiles in a surpriseattack explains why people concerned about strategic stability liked theNagle-Dornan idea.

The depressed-trajectory missile would fly longer in theatmosphere and come in at a lower angle_which is bad news for the kindof defenses of airfields, communication centers and other key militarytargets on which the SDI program, sobered by costs and technical problemsof an astrodome defense of cities, is now chiefly focused. Since the attackingmissile is in the atmosphere longer and may be coming from a wider rangeof angles, the defense can't use several ``layers'' of interceptors, andits sensors will have a harder time picking up the attack.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For these reasons, depressed-trajectory attacks would threaten boththe bomber element of the deterrent and the prospects for useful defensesto strengthen, not replace, deterrence.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fortunately, firing on depressed trajectories requires more than just``elevating them missiles a little lower.'' Depressed trajectories entailgreater stresses and added heat from prolonged flight in the atmosphere,as well as special demands on the guidance systems. As a result, they wouldrequire major changes in the middle_which would take extensive tests andseveral years. So far neither side has done any such tests, or even shownany signs of preliminary work toward them.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">But so long as the potential advantages of the capability exist_andthey do for both sides if, as is too often the case at the early stagesof a program, you ignore stability_there is a risk someone will try. TheNagle-Dornan amendment would simply require that the United States stayout of the depressed-trajectory business unless the Soviets start suchtests. We could readily detect any Soviet effort, so the ban is not unilateralbut rather is contingent on Soviet restraint.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Such a measure puts the depressed-trajectory issue back on the armcontrol agenda and, meanwhile, protects deterrence, B-1s, SDI and the Navybudget priorities.

Now, again with permission, I would like to take a few minutesof the Senate's time to explain this matter, and to make the case thatthe House has broached an extremely important subject which is ripe foraction, preferably in negotiations with the Soviets, but also quite possibly,in legislation as well.To this time, Mr. President, both we and the Soviets launch ballistic missileson what are called minimum energy trajectories. That is, we launch themalong a path which gets them out of the atmosphere and into space as rapidlyas possible. The reason we do this is that flight through the atmosphereconsumes energy, and so the shorter the time spent powering through theatmosphere, the better, from the point of view of payload and range.But if, for any reason, we or the Soviets were to place a very high premiumon reducing the time it takes for a missile to cover a given distance,we would think about changing the trajectory. What we would do is flattenthe arc along which the missile flies, cutting off the time it spends inspace, in favor of a much more direct route to its dest<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>in<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tion. This is what the term depressed trajectorymeans.As applied to ICBM's, depressed trajectories are not practical, becausethe distance between launch points and targets is too great, and too muchenergy would be used up in flight through the atmosphere. But in the caseof submarine launched ballistic missiles, it would be feasible to bringsubmarines in closer to their targets, and then fire missiles at thesetargets along depressed trajectories.The effect would be a dramatic shortening of flight time. In fact, flighttime could be reduced to such an extent that the entire detection and launchcontrol system of the United States might be circumvented. If the standardtime to target of a Soviet SLBM is between 12 and 13 minutes, the timeto target of a depressed trajectory SLBM could be about 5 minutes.Depressed trajectory SLBM's are not part of our development plans. So faras I know the Soviets have not tested one. But a decision on the part ofeither country to go down this path would be extremely destabilizing. Depressedtrajectory SLBM's would thre<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ten our missiles in silos and their command and controlcenters. It would threaten our bombers on their bases. It would threatenthe ground-based elements of an SDI system. It would threaten rail mobileMX severely. It would require a more costly deployment mode for Midgetman.What we have therefore is a rare situation in arms control. It is possiblefor us to close off an avenue of development which would be very menacing,but which neither side has yet begun<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>to traverse.I am inclined to think our colleagues have a good idea and are on the righttrack. The issue will now be further explored in conference. I hope thatthis brief preview will help to inspire Senate interest in this initiativefrom the other body.[S16MY8-818]{S5955}response o<ITAG tagnum="89">response on subject of depressed trajectory missiles</ITAG>[S16MY8-819]{S5955}NUNNMr. NUNN.

Mr. President, I understand the amendment of the Senator fromKansas has been presented. The amendment states it is the sense of theCongress that indictments of Noriega should not be dropped, and I alsounderst<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nd that there are certain news reports that a dealhas be<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n reached in which the indictments will be droppedin return for a promise from Noriega to leave office sometime later thisyear.I do not know whether that report is accurate or not. It may be that wewill find out tomorrow. My own personal view is that you do not indicta foreign leader of a country, even a small country, unless you know beforeyou indict them how you are going to follow through with that indictment.It is a judicial matter but it is a highly volatile political matter.I think the testimony before our Subcommittee on Investigations was prettyclear that we are dealing with an individual here who certainly h<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s been involved in either passive involvement indrugs or perhaps even active.So we are talking about something that is rather clear so far as the testimonyis concerned that has been received in the committee that I deal with,although he certainly has not had his day in court, and that is what thejudicial process is all about.My own view is that unless you know what you are doing and are going tofollow through and are going to pursue the extradition, you never shouldindict, to begin with.The question is, now that indictments have come, and apparently we didnot know where we are going, we did not have plans for extradition andways to go about it, and we did not have any alt<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rnative plans, so certainly we have dug ourselvesinto a hole here.So far as my own position on this amendment is concerned, I will have towait to hear from the Foreign Relations Committee.I share the Senator's sentiments. I think once you do it, to withdraw it,to me, is sending a very bad signal.So, I would be inclined to vote for the amendment, but I do not think itcan be accepted tonight, since we have not heard from the Foreign RelationsCommittee. It is primarily their jurisdiction. I think we probably oughtto carry it over until tomorrow morning and hear from them.[S16MY8-822]{S5955}DOLEMr. DOLE addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. <T4>Breaux</T4>).

Maybe it willfollow the Helms amendment.It may be that it is not going to have any impact, anyway. There may havebeen something already done. It would be a little after the fact. Thatis the reason I hoped to do it this evening, because the cake may not betotally baked, and by morning it may be frosted. So we wdill see what happensbetween now and then.I know it is very difficult, and we can stand here in the Senate and say,``Get rid of Noriega; somebody else has to do it.'' A lot of things havebeen tried that have not worked. Maybe this is the best deal that can bearranged, if there is a deal. But I am afraid it is never going to be fullyunderstood by the American people.This is not just somebody we picked up on the street. This, as the Senatorfrom Georgia indicates, is a foreign leader, and I am certain they didnot go int<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> this lightly.In fact, the U.S. attorneys who worked on it at one time indicated theywould resign if the indictments were dismissed.

Noreiga seemsto be more popular than ever.I am not certain what the terms are, but as reported on some of the newsprograms this evening, he would not leave the country; he would still havesome say on what happens so far as his successor is concerned. There area lot of rumors around; nobody knows the facts.I certainly had no objection to waiting until the morning. Everyody hasmade commitments, and the majority leader has announced that there willbe no more votes this evening. I will abide by whatever the Senator fromGeorgia wants to do.[S16MY8-824]{S5955}NUNNMr. NUNN.

As the floor manager,I do not want to get into another committee's jurisdiction, which we dofrequently, but it is during the time they are here and we can check withthem, and at least they have a chance to voice their opinion. At this stage,I would not feel that I have the general authority to make an agreement,with three or four people here, and vote on this tonight, without havingheard from them.Reluctant as I am to postpone anything on this bill, I am in a position<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>where I have to recommend that course, unless theSenator would like to stay and <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>try to bring some people back in.Mr. President, I say to both leaders, as they already know, that we havethe Helms Panama vote at 9:30, and we could proceed with the Dole amendmentafter that, or we could proceed before that.[S16MY8-825]{S5956}DOLEMr. DOLE.

I ask the majority leader: I guess those are all the amendments,so far as the chairman knows.[S16MY8-828]{S5956}NUNNMr. NUNN. I would be reluctant<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> I say to the Senator from Kansas, to express certainlyabout it, because we have a lot of other amendments eligible to be calledup. We have a lot of indications that they will not be, but we do not knowthat for sure.[S16MY8-829]{S5956}DOLEMr. DOLE. I also understand that the majority leader has indicated thathe may be in a position to start on the INF Treaty tomorrow, which is goodnews. I commned the distinguished majority leader, not just for callingit up but for making certain we ironed out a lot of these problems beforewe called it up. We have not lost any time. We would have been on the Senatefloor debating the nine points that have been clarified in the past severaldays. We probably saved time.[S16MY8-830]{S5956}NUNNMr. NUNN. I agree.[S16MY8-831]{S5956}DOLEMr. DOLE. I commend those who have been involved on both sides of the aisle,particularly the majority leader, who has made certain that he protectsthe rights of the U.S. Senate in its constitutional rol<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, and with the cooperation of the administration.So there has not been any acrimony or any differences.I do not know what time the majority leader thinks that may happen tomorrow,but I assume it would be after the policy luncheon.[S16MY8-832]{S5956}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, first, let me thank the minority leader and thechairman of the committee for putting the vote over on the amendment byMr. <T4>Dole </T4>until tomorrow, in view of the fact that Mr. <T4>Helms<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213></T4>has not given his assent. I think it would notbe wise for us to go forward this evening. He is a very responsible anddedicated and conscientious chairman, and I think we owe it to him to clearthat matter before we go forward. Any Senator has a right to ask for theyeas and nays. So it may be that the yeas and nays would occur on thatamendment tomorrow.I respond to the distinguished Republican leader: The Senate will comein tomorrow at 9. If the minority leader is agreeable, we could cut ourtime to 5 minutes each, and then we will go on the DOD authorization bill.Senator <T4>Nunn </T4>and<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Senator <T4>Warner </T4>will be here to deal with any amendments and to perhapsdiscuss the amendment by Mr. <T4>Dole </T4>and determine whether or not that amendment can be voicevoted or whether or not it should have a division or a rollcall vote.Then the vote on the bill is supposed to occur at 10 o'clock, but any Senatorwho wishes to call up an amendment as long as i<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> is on the list that Senator will be entitled tocall it up and get a vote on it. There will not be any time for debate,but he can still get a vote.At this time, as I understand what Mr. <T4>Nunn </T4>has said, we are in no position to know whether or not therewill be any other amendments that Senators want to call up and have a voteon.Then when we reach 10 o'clock, it would depend at that point on what happensin relation to the D'Amato amendment. We were going to<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>attempt to table it today. There could be anothertabling motion, of course, occur at that<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>time tomorrow.There could be a motion to postpone it or there could be other ways theSenate could go.But hopefully the DOD authorization bill will be disposed of at 10<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>'clock a.m. or shortly thereafter.I would hope then to go to the treaty following the conferences of thetwo parties, and proceed to a reasonable hour tomorrow afternoon or eveningand then be on the treaty daily until the Senate completes action on it.Circumstances from time to time might dictate the action that we will haveto take. If there should be a Presidential veto message that comes intothe Senate while the Senate is on the treaty, that could alter circumstanceshere. Also, if a cloture motion should be introduced and were to be favorablyvoted on by the required supermajority, that very definitely would impingeupon further action on the treaty until the matter clotured could be disposedof. By unanimous consent, of course, the Senate could move on to the treatyor other matters regardless of either one of the two.So it would seem to me that by beginning our work on the treaty tomorrowwe ought to be able to make good headway on it. The study of the treatywill be thorough and will be careful, and that is about the way I see itas of this time.[S16MY8-833]{S5956}DOLEMr. DOLE. I thank the majority leader.[S16MY8-834]{S5956}BYRDMr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. I want to say in that regard,too, that our chairmen of the Foreign Relations and Armed Services andIntelligence Committees and our ranking members of the Intelligence andArmed Services<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Committees have written to us both in a letter_thechairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations wrote to me a separate letter_indicatingthat the matters that were in question have been gone into thoroughly andhave been resolved to the satisfaction of the signatories of those letters,and on that basis I have full confidence now that the Senate is preparedto move ahead with debate and action on the treaty. I think that the actionsby the committees in thoroughly hearing the questions and the issues thathave been raised are a service to the Senate and to the country.I personally am very indebted to Mr. <T4>Nunn, </T4>Mr. <T4>Boren, </T4>Mr. <T4>Warner, </T4>Mr. <T4>Cohen, </T4>and Mr. <T4>Pell </T4>for the dutiful approach that we have seen demonstrated toattend to these problems that arose in connection with the treaty. I alsowant to congratulate the administration for moving expeditiously, sendingthe negotiators back to Moscow and for tying up these loose ends and forapparently having resolved the questions that were at issue. I think itwas important that those matters be resolved. I think it has enhanced thesecurity interests of this country. Not only that but I think it has enhancedthe movement and the desire for all of us, or most of us certainly to moveahead with reasonable, workable, effective arms control.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated May 16, 1988,addressed to myself and Mr. <T4>Dole </T4>from Messrs <T4>Nunn, Boren, Warner, </T4>and <T4>Cohen, </T4>and a letter dated May 16, 1988, addressed to me from Mr.<T4>Pell </T4>be printed in the <T4>Record.</T4>There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the<T4>Record, </T4>as follows:<ITAG tagnum="51">U.S. Senate,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Select Committee on Intelligence,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="53">Washington, DC, May 16, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="54">Hon. </ITAG><T4>Robert C.

I hope we can find a wayto handle the D'Amato amendment that will not preclude final passage tomorrowmorning of the DOD bill. For all sorts of reasons, we need to get thatbill to conference. I favor the D'Amato amendment. I favor that approach.For someone involved in drug trafficking who participates in the killingof victims based on the drug trafficking, I favor capital punishment.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="1">1I know, and everyone knows here, we are not going to pass the DODbill if this matter is not resolved.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to introducelegislation to modify the present starting point for the defintion of ``Vietnamera.'' I am honored to be joined in this effort by the chairman of theVeterans' Affairs Committee, Senator <T4>Cranston. </T4>Enactment of this legislation will enable those veterans who honorablyserved this country in the Republic of Vietnam prior to the present startingdate to qualify for certain benefits for which they are now eligible. The definition of Vietnam era is now set by statute, section 101 (29),title 38, United States Code, as August 5, 1964, to May 7<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> 1975. Service in the Armed Forces during that period entitles veterans, who qualifyunder specific eligibility requirements, to VA benefits such as pension,readjustment counseling, burial, and on-the-job training, education, orapprenticeship benefits. The present starting date, August 5, 1964, coincides with President Johnson'smessage to the Congress of an attack by North Vietnamese gunboats on twoUnited States Navy destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin the preceeding day.The end date was originally set by President Ford in a Presidential proclamationand later enacted by Congress. In concept, the Gulf of Tonkin incident is an acceptable date to delineatethe beginning of the Vietnam era. Clearly, it is the wate<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>rs<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>hed event in the history of the United States involvementin Vietnam. But, while conceptually defensible, the present definition services toexclude the United States troops who served in the Republic of Vietnam,sometimes in combat conditions, well before August 5, 1964. I would note, for example, that the names on the Vietnam Vete<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ra<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ns War Memorial includes casualties prior to thatdate. In fact, the date of the earliest casualty listed on the memorialis October 21, 1957. Mr. President, establishing a starting date for a period of war, such asVietnam, where there was no one, single action beginning the involvementof United States service personnel is at best an uncertain science. Nonetheless, I think that a better option for designating the startingpoint of the Vietnam era for those veterans who served in the Republicof Vietnam prior to the Gulf of Tonkin incident is available to the Senate.That is February 28, 1961. This is the date, set forth in Public Law 89-257, after which United Statesservice personnel could accept awards from the Government of the Republicof Vietnam in connection with service in Viet<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nam<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>.February 28, 1961, also begins the Vietnam era for the purposes of theInternal Revenue Service_relating to the treatment of income for tax purposesfor members of the Armed Forces serving in Vietnam in ce<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tain circumstances_and the Immigration and NaturalizationService_relating to expedited naturalization based on wartime service.Efforts to move back the starting point of the definition of ``Vietnamera'' for veterans who served in Vietnam prior to August 5, 1964, are notnew. In fact, over the years, Senator <T4>Cranston </T4>has introduced three bills to do so. S. 11, introduced in 1983, and S. 2269, introduced in 1984, would haveextended the definition of Vietnam era to J<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ly 8, 1959, the date of the first United States militarycasualty in Vietnam listed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial at the timeof its dedication.The previous date of the first casualty I mentioned earlier was added tothe memorial subsequent to its dedication. S. 6, introduced in 1985, would have extended the period to February 28,1961, the date contained in the legislation I am introducing today. The Senate has twice passed legislation to extend the starting point backFebruary 28, 1961, most recently as part of H.R. 505 on July 30, 1985.Unfortunately, the House has not agreed with the wisdom of making sucha change. Mr. President, I believe there is more than enough supporting evidenceto warrant extending the present definition of Vietnam era as proposedin this legislation.Making the change would bring better uniformity among Federal agenciesin terms of defining this period. Probably most importantly, it would discontinue the present situation inwhich the Federal Government tells veterans who actually serve in combatsituations in Vietnam prior to August 5, 1964, that they are not Vietnam-eraveterans. I hope that other Members of the Senate will join Senator <T4>Cranston </T4>and me in supporting this change.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which addressesa serious problem facing farmers and our rural communities. This legislation,the State Grain Fund Protection Act of 1988, is identical to H.R. 4329,already introduced in the House by my good friend,<T4> Terry Bruce.</T4>The intent of this legislation is to ensure that all farmers are protectedfrom severe financial losses resulting from the failure of a grain warehousefacility. In a recent U.S. District Court decision, it was ruled that elevators thatare federally licenses, are not required to participate in a State's indemnityprogram. There are federally license<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> elevators which have opted to p<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ar<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ticipate in<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>State grain funds. At the same time, however, thereare many federally licensed elevators which have not. Mr. President, farmers are not concerned with the type of license an elevatorpossesses. Rather, they are concerned, and rightly so, with the protectionsthey are accorded by storing their grain with an elevator. It is my firmbelief that every farmer is entitled to have his or he<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> investment protected, to the fullest extent, whenit is stored with an elevator, regardless of whether the elevator holdsa <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tate or a Federal license.Mr. President, history has demonstrated that federally licensed warehousesare not immune from the financial difficulties which can plague State licensedfacilities. It is an unfortunate fact, but the Federal requirements provideonly limited and inadequate protection to our farmers. Those elevatorsnot participating in State programs do not provide the same degree of protectionthat farmers receive from elevators which do participate in the State programs.In my State of Illinois, th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>re are 77 elevator facilities licensed by the FederalGovernment which do not participate in the State insurance program. Thecurrent protection system, established under the U.S. Warehouse Act, providesthat grain storage companies licensed by the Federal Government must posta storage bond to cover losses. These bonds, however, would not be adequateto cover the losses incurred by all farmers with grain stored in federallylicensed elevators.The farmers of Illinois are adversely affected by this recent court ruling,but they are not alone. Other States which currently have some form ofState indemnity funds on the books include Iowa, Ohio, South Carolina,Oklahoma, Kentucky, and New York. Moreover, the States of Idaho, Michigan,South Dakota, and Washington are presently considering the establishmentof State indemnity programs to protect their farmers.The legislation that I am introducing will amend the U.S. Warehouse Actto allow States to require that all elevators participate in State grainfunds, whether they are licensed by the Federal Government or the Stategovernment. In essence, this will allow States the right to decide howthey want to handle elevator liability in the event of a failure.The State Grain Fund Protection Act of 1988 restores protection to farmerswhile their grain is being ware<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>housed. It is an approach which represents both commonsense and fairness. I urge my colleagues to join me in this important andworthy effort.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printedin the <T4>Record.</T4>There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record,as follows:[S16MY8-911]{S5960}S. 2397<ITAG tagnum="71">S. 2397</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the UnitedStates of America in Congress assembled,</T3></ITAG>[S16MY8-912]{S5960}SECTION 1.<ITAG tagnum="72">SECTION 1.

Both the Colorado andArizona operations are dependent on imported yttrium concentrates for feedstockssince there are no significant domestic sources of yttrium feedstocks.Both refiners face the added disadvantage of competing against foreignrefiners who have access to duty-free feedstocks.While the duty on yttrium is relatively small_roughly between $100,000and $150,000_it is undermining the viability of the two remaining U.S.refiners. In order that these refiners can remain competitive, it is appropriatethat Congress renew the duty suspension on high-purity yttrium.Mr. Presid<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>en<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t, I ask that the legislation be printed at thispoint in the <T4>Record.</T4></ITAG>[S16MY8-923]{S5960}S. 2399<ITAG tagnum="74"/>S. 2399<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Represen<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ta<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tives of the United States of America in Congressassembled.</T3> That item 907.51 of the Appendix to the Ta<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>iff Schedules of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202)is amended by striking out ``12/31/88'' and inserting ``12/31/93''.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Sec. </T4>2.

Mr. President, today it gives me great pleasureto introduce legislation to officially designate the Pony Express Trailas a National Historic Trail under the National Trails System.I suspect that it would be hard to find an American who has not heard ofthe Pony Express, or who does not relish its legendary story. With only80 men and 500 ponies, and lasting only 79 weeks, the Pony Express provideda vital communication link between the East and the West, and was instrumentalin keeping California in the Union. Its backers, Russell, Majors, and Waddell,lost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and were never paid the money theFederal Government promised them.

They swore on a Bible to behave honestly, notto ``cuss'' or drink, and not to fight with their fellow riders or abusetheir steeds. They rode 75 to 100 miles per day, changing horses every10 or 15 miles at relay stations. And no time was wasted: in one leap,both the expressman and his ``mochila,'' a leather saddle blanket containingfour ``cantinas,'' or boxes, for carrying the mail, were transferred tothe new mount. These courageous couriers suffered hardship, deprivation,the threat of ambush by hostile Indians, and a terrific daily physicalpounding_all for about $40 to $100 per month, plus room and board.From its inception, the Pony Express was a model of efficiency, demonstratingwhat the private sector can accomplish when unbridled by Government redtape.For years, the Government had balked at the possibility of establishingreliable, consistent overland mail service, bel<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ie<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ving that the ``great American desert'' was impenetrable.Impatient with the Washington politicos, Russell decided in December 1859to launch the Pony Express, which would follow the Central Overland route,without Government contract. With little fanfare, it was announced on March23, 1860, that on April 3 the Pony Express would begin running.Approximately 1,900 miles long, the Pony Express ran from St. Joseph, MO,the westernmost point reached by the railroad<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> and <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>telegraph, through parts of Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado,Wyoming, Utah, my home State of Nevada, and California, where it endedin Sacramento. Then as now, the need for an adequate and ample water supplyplayed an important role, determining where relay stations would be located,and opening up new parts of the country.In just 10\1/2\ days, the mail sped from terminus to terminus, a tremendousimprovement over mail service by steamer which could take up to 6 weeks.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n a record of slightly over 7 days, the Pony Expressdelivered the news of President Lincoln's inauguration. When the servicewas started, family members back home in the East could keep in touch witha loved one in a remote mining camp for $5 a half ounce, although it costthe company $38 to carry that half ounce!

Mr. President, in general, COBRA requires employers to notifyterminated employees, separated and divorced spouses and dependents ofemployees, and spouses and dependents of deceased employees of their eligibilityto continue to participate in the group health benefits provided by theemployer. The employer may charge the individual who ``buys into'' thegroup coverage under these provisions a maximum of 102 percent of the applicablepremium for that coverage.While not seeking to change the purpose of this law, my bill addresseswhat I believe was an oversight in its drafting: as written, a terminatedemployee may continue to participate in the former employer's group policyeven if he or she becomes employed by a second employer who maintains ahealth benefits plan. The same is true for separated and divorced spouses,and spouses of deceased employees.The example set out in Mr. Hauser's letter, drawn from an actual case,may help to clarify. In Mr. Hauser's example, after an employee of oneof the Iowa Association of Business andamp; Industry's members, Jenesis Ltd.-ExodusLtd., divorced her husband, her ex-husband applied, and was accepted, forcontinued coverage by Jenesis Ltd/Exocus Ltd. under the COBRA provision.Even though he is gainfully employed and eligible for coverge under hisown company's plan, he has opted to stay on the insurance roll of JenesisLtd.-Exodus Ltd. and is eligible to remain there for 36 months. Addinginsult to injury, Jenesis Ltd.-Exodus Ltd. is self-insured, so that allclaims filed against it by the ex-husband of its employee come directlyfrom its earnings.The purpose of the COBRA provision is to allow a greater number of peopleto participate in affordable group health coverage, and not, I think itis fair to say, to allow workers to pick and choose among insurance plans.My bill simply provides that if a person is eligible to participate underanother group health plan, their eligibility for continuation coverageceases. This is already the situation for persons who become eligible forMedicare_they are not covered by the health care continuation provision.I hope that my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring this legislation,and that we can correct this oversight quickly so that additional businessesare not affected.<ITAG tagnum="63"/><ITAG tagnum="18">By Mr. BRADLEY:</ITAG>S. 2402.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislationto add an additional warning label to tobacco advertisements and tobaccoproducts sold in the United States. This new warning label reads as follows:</ITAG>[S16MY8-933]{S5962}<ITAG tagnum="21">WARNING: Smoking is addictive. Once you start, you may not be ableto stop.</ITAG>The evidence is now overwhelming. Nicotine is a powerful habit-formingdrug which may lead to compulsive use and a great diminished capacity toexercise free will over tobacco use. Leading national and internationalorganizations, including the American Psychiatric Association, World HealthOrganization, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and now the Surgeon General,have declared that chronic tobacco use constitutes addiction.Mr. President, today, the Surgeon General is releasing his report on tobacco.This report provides conclusive evidence that nicotine is an addictivedrug. Many people consider tobacco a habit or a custom. It is more. Tobe addictive, a drug must cause compulsive use and have altering mood effectsas well as rewarding effects that reinforce drug-taking behavior. Nicotinemeets these criteria.I am pleased that the Surgeon General is focusing attention on the addictivepowers of nicotine. It is terribly important that young people realizethat once they begin to use tobacco, they may not be able to stop. We needto do everything we can to stop tobacco use. If more people realize thatnicotine is a harmful addictive drug, the fewer people will use tobacco.Mr. President, tobacco is the single biggest health hazard facing thiscountry. Virtually all scientific evidence recognizes the dangers of tobacco.More than 300,000 people die from smoking each year. Smoking contributesto 30 percent of deaths due to cancer and to 25 percent of coronary heartdisease in this country.Today, everyone agrees_everyone, that is, except the tobacco manufacturers_thattobacco is a killer. The debate has turned to defining the proper Federalrole in discouraging the use of tobacco.The Federal Government currently has conflicting policies on tobacco. Wespend millions on health research in an effort to help the millions afflictedby tobacco-related diseases, and at the same time we provide subsidiesto farmers to grow tobacco. We place labels on tobacco products warningpeople of the direct link between use and illness, and at the same timewe allow the excise tax on cigarettes to drop in real terms by 50 percentover the decades. And we spend millions on public health campaigns to warnpeople of the dangers of tobacco, and at the same time allow manufacturersto write off billions of dollars in advertising expenses that are aimedat encouraging people to smoke or use smokeless tobacco.The Government should speak with one voice on this problem. I believe thatvoice should unequivocally say, ``smoking will harm you.'' We need toughFederal laws that send the message loud and clear. The bill I am introducingtoday will help to send this message.Before concluding, Mr. President, I would like to quote from a 1972 PhilipMorris document that has been brought to my attention. It describes inno uncertain terms the fact that cigarettes are simply packaging for nicotine.[S16MY8-934]{S5962}<ITAG tagnum="21">The cigarette should be conceived not as a product but as a package.The product is nicotine. The cigarette is but one of many package layers.There is the carton, which contains the pack, which contains the cigarette,which contains the smoke. The smoke is the final package. The smoker muststrip off all these package layers to get to that which he seeks. * * *Think of the cigarette pack as a storage container for a day's supportof nicotine. * * * Think of the cigarette as a dispenser for a dose unitof nicotine. * * * Think of a puff of smoke as the vehicle of nicotine.* * * Smoke is beyond question the most optimized vehicle of nicotine andthe cigarette the most optimized dispenser of smoke.</ITAG>Mr. President, tobacco is the vehicle for delivering nicotine to the public.We know that nicotine kills. Now we know that nicotine is addictive. Itis government's job to see that fewer and fewer people spend their timetrying to receive their ``dose unit'' of nicotine.andCx.1;<ITAG tagnum="63"/><ITAG tagnum="18">By Mr. MOYNIHAN:</ITAG>S. 2403.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the MagneticCoal Separation Act of 1988. This is a bill to promote a new and promisingtechnology in the field of coal combustion, and it is an acid rain controlbill. I hope it will lead to reducing the levels of acid rain that areplaguing our country's lakes, rivers and forests, and those of our neighborto the north.The recent visit to the United States by Canadian Prime Minister Mulroneyto Washington focused our attention once again on the obstacles to acidrain legislation. We discussed possible solutions to the acid rain problemaffecting both of our countries. The solution may be in new, emerging technologiessuch as superconductivity.</ITAG>[S16MY8-937]{S5962}national a<ITAG tagnum="89">national acid precipitation assessment program</ITAG>In 1979, I introduced the first, and to date the only Federal legislationon acid rain. This bill, the Acid Precipitation Act of 1980, set in motiona comprehensive, 10-year research program that has now firmly establishedthese emissions from coal-fired power plants are a major contributor toacid rain. Last fall the Environment and Public Works Committee_of whichI am ranking majority member_approved legislation to reduce acid rain aspart of comprehensive amendments to the Clean Air Act. Control of acidrain needs to be a top priority. We simply must do it. But we should notlay all our hopes on one piece of legislation. Acid rain is a complex andonly partially understood phenomenon, and is open to many solutions. Amongthese, any approach that does not unduly threaten both the coal and electricgeneration industries should be most seriously considered.Technology may come to our rescue. To reduce acid rain, we must reduceemission of sulfur into the atmosphere_sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxideare all too quickly converted to acid rain in our atmosphere. Most coalcontains significant amounts of sulfur (mostly in the form of magneticallyreactive iron pyrite). The idea behind coal separation is to remove thissulfur before the coal enters the furnace. In addition, magnetic separationtechnology offers potential for gas emissions control using molecular gasseparation techniques. In this application, gases are differentiated bymolecular spins of individual molecules. Powerful superconducting magnetswould be used to remove gases such as nitrous oxides from the emissionsplume within the stack. By reducing sulfur and eliminating these emissions,we begin to reduce acid rain.[S16MY8-938]{S5962}supercondu<ITAG tagnum="89">superconducting coal separation</ITAG>And so the question arises: why should we pursue development of new, precombustionclean coal technology when conventional coal cleaning techniques are available?The reasons are several.First and foremost, our most commonly used pollution control technologyfor sulfur emissions, the flue gas scrubber, <ITAG tagnum="80">is extremely expensive. On a cost-per-ton-removed basis, scrubbersrun between $350 to $500_at least twice the price of switching to low-sulfurfuels. If we clean coal before we burn it, then we are effectively switchingto low sulfur fuels. If we rely on the scrubber as our sole means of controllingsulfur emissions, then coal_our most abundant domestic energy resource_couldsimply be discontinued in favor of cheaper alternatives, such as naturalgas. Scrubbers are that expensive. It is clearly something to be avoided.</ITAG>This brings us to coal separation. Conventional coal separation utilizesa wet process that requires supplemental energy for drying before thiscoal can be fed to a boiler. The excess moisture <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>that <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>results from this process results in energy penaltiesduring combustion.But magnetic separation of impurities avoids these drawbacks_coal is groundinto a fine, dry powder that is run through very powerful magnets madeaffordable by the new, high temperature superconductors just now beingdiscovered. Impurities_sulfur_are pulled to one side, and the final productis a cleaner, dry coal powder, ready for immediate combustion. A dry processsaves valuable time during preparation, separation, and handling. Greaterpurity also means lower plant cleaning and maintenance costs. Further,it allows for quick repetitive cleaning cycles through the magnetic fieldto ensure cleaning efficiency. Time required for a single cleaning cyclefor a prototype unit has been a matter of minutes; as a consequence, multiplecleaning cycles can be run in much less time than necessary for a one-stepconventional separation process. Estimates for operational costs are 25percent of those associated with conventional coal cleaning operations.[S16MY8-939]{S5963}new superc<ITAG tagnum="89">new superconducting materials</ITAG>This idea has been around for some time, but has not been aggressivelypursued. This is due in large part to the large amounts of electricityrequired for generating such powerful magnetic fields. The new ceramicsuperconductors have changed all this. Magnets made with the new, high-temperaturesuperconductors will be stronger than conventional magnets of comparablesize, and require only a fraction <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>of <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the power. Current estimates of energy savings arearound 75 percent.Conventional superconductors require liquid helium to adequately cool thesuperconducting material. This extremely low temperature requirement hasrestricted these materials to a few specialized fields. The new high temperaturematerials can be adequately cooled using liquid nitrogen, at a fractionof the cost of liquid helium. In short, this new process holds the promiseof being more efficient that conventional coal separation, and cheaperthan flue gas scrubbers. Quite a bargain.The bill I am proposing today will allow us to bring this idea to fruition.So far the only existing prototype, at Argonne National <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Laboratory <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>in Illinois, uses preexisting low temperature superconductingmagnets. I would expect that some of the funds this bill authorizes wouldgo toward creating a prototype using the new, <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>high-temp<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>erature superconducting magnets. Such a prototypewill be needed to produce data on both operating costs and cleaning efficiencies_informationvitally necessary for the commercialization of any new technology of thissort.Only sustained research and development will allow us to take advantageof this technology and ensure its timely availability. The bill I am introducingtoday would authorize $50 million for research, development and commercializationof magnetic coal separation and magnetic emissions controls, with the ultimateaim of seeing it used at coal fired power plants across the country, particularlyin areas of predominantly high-sulfur coal.It is my firm belief that the Congress will enact acid rain legislation.It may happen this year, or even next, but it will almost surely happen,and we must strive to see that the legislation we do enact deals with allfacets of the problem. I hope my colleagues will see the wisdom of usingthis promising technology to eliminate acid rain at its source, and willsupport this bill.andCx.1;<ITAG tagnum="63"/><ITAG tagnum="18">By Mr. LEAHY:</ITAG>S.J.

Mr. President, hysteria is running rampant.In the middle of a supposed war on drugs, the Surgeon General has mistakenthe enemy. In comparing tobacco_a legitimate and legal substance_to insidiousnarcotics such as heroin and cocaine, he has directed ``friendly fire''at American farmers and businessmen.To say that tobacco is an addictive as heroin and cocaine is to trivializethe effect these mind-altering substances have on those who violate lawsto obtain, sell and use them. Are cigarette smokers_and tobacco farmers_nobetter th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n those who traffic in illegal substances?I'm told that cigarette smoking is on the decline among our young people.I'm also told that drug us<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> is on the increase among those very same young people.Which of these practices deserve our strongest efforts?I'm told that some 40 million Americans are former smokers, and that 95percent of them quite smoking without help. If that is so, perhaps theSurgeon General can tell me how he considers tobacco addictive. Perhapshe can also tell me why the millions of Americans who are overweight arenot addicted to food.Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised. This is the administrati<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>on<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> that declares war on drugs, and then counsels peopleto ``just say no.''This is the administrati<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>on<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> that, when tons of drugs are flowing into the countryin airplanes and ships, confiscates a luxury yacht with a pinch of marijuanaaboard.This is the administration that wants to give an indicted Central Americandrug lord more adv<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>an<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ce notice that it is willing to give American factoryworkers.I think the Surgeon General's priorities are skewed. He should get offthe backs of legitimate, law-abiding American farmers, and concentrateon those who are breaking our laws to addict and corrupt our citizens.There are straightforward reasons for warning about smoking.

Mr. President, I rise today to herald a <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>historic event that occurred on April 21, 1988, duringthe celebration of Israel's 40th anniversary_the signing of a memorandumof agreement regarding political, security and economic cooperation betweenthe United States and Israel. This historic agre<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ment recognizes the development of close and increasinglyproductive bilateral relations that have grown to new proportions in theeighties. It institutionalizes a history of growing and d<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>pending strategic cooperation with Israel, whichreflects a shared interest in building p<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ace and stability in the region. Israel is a fellowdemocratic nation and major non-NATO ally with which the United Stateshas mutual security and economic interests. Strategic cooperation is nota one-way street. The relationship with Israel has greatly enhanced America'sstrategic position in the Middle East and the Mediterranean and has servedas a deterrent to <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>con<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>flict in the region. In all these important areas_military, economic, and strategic_the twonations are erecting a comprehensive framework for building on the achievementof the past and growing into the future while shielding them from the politicalturmoil of the region. Central to this relationship are a series of bilateral groups establishedin recent years that have been of great value to both countries. The JointPolitical Military Group [JPMG] has assisted in the initiation of jointmilitary planning, prepositioning of United States defense material inIsrael and combined exercises with Israeli forces. The Joint Security AssistancePlanning <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>G<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>roup [JSAP] coordinates the effective implementationof U.S. security assistance and reviews cooperative defense <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>industrial issues. The Joint Economic DevelopmentGroup [JEDG] <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>concerns itself with developing policies which promotea strong and self-sufficient economy in Israel. With the signing of thisMOA, these groups will now continue to exist and to strengthen their effortstoward the building of strategic ties between our two nations. Mr. President, Israel is our close friend and ally, and we both have be<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ne<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>fit<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d greatly from our close ties.

A motion was passed for the fire company to purchasea ladder for $9.25 and later that year, a school cellar became the firstfirehouse where this equipment was stored.On April 6, 1888, the Wenonah Fire Co. was officially formed. During theearly years, alarms were sounded by striking a suspended cut automotivewheel rim with a sledge hammer. This was eventually replaced by a ropepulled bell on a high pole, and eventually by a modern alarm sy<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ste<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>m.In 1906, the fire company was incorporated with 10 charter members. Thefire company building was completed in 1909. In the next few years, thecompany purchased a motorized truck and a new alarm system siren.Beginning in the early 1920's until 1942, a carnival was held in Augustof each year as the prime source of operating funds. In 1937, the firecompany began inviting neighboring fire companies to participate in theFourth of July parade. In December 1937, a ladies auxiliary was formedwhich planned to build an addition to the firehouse, a social hall andkitchen.In May 1943, a first aid station application was made to the American RedCross and approval was received in August 1943. Thus establishing the WFCas one of the first official rescue squads in New Jersey.In 1958, advancements in technology opened up communication with otherfire companies, increasing the efficiency of all companies at an alarm.In the 1970's WFC became the first fire company in the county to add asecond frequency to their system. In 1963, an addition to the firehousewas completed to house more modern equipment.In 1976, the first female member joined the Wenonah Fire Co. Today, menand women are welcome, active and important members who make the companyvery effective. The community of Wenonah has been active in supportingits fire company. Its contributions have helped to purchase the best fireequipment available for today's needs.From bucket brigade to hose cart, from horsedrawn fire truck to dieselpowered pumpers, the tireless efforts of the company's dedicated individualshave saved life and property for 10<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>0<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> years. Wenonah Fire Co. will be celebrating itscentennial year with many celebrations throughout 1988; with a companybanquet, a Fourth of July parade for the entire community, and in October,an open house for the townspeople and neighboring fire companies.Mr. President, I congratulate the Wenonah Fire Co. for its 100 years service,and extend my best wishes for continued success in the future.andCx.1;</ITAG>[S16MY8-1077]{S5970}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S16MY8-1078]{S5970}ISRAEL'S 4<ITAG tagnum="81">ISRAEL'S 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF INDEPENDENCE</ITAG>[S16MY8-1079]{S5970}SIMON<ITAG tagnum="10">andCx.1; Mr. SIMON.

Mr. President, since last Monday I havebeen examining the reasons why Abe Stolar and his family remain in theSoviet Union. Abe is a native Chicagoan who has been trying to leave theSoviet Union since 1974. The Soviets say Abe is free to leave but theyrefuse to allow his daughter-in-law, Julia, to leave with the rest of thefamily. I mentioned previously that Julia's mother refuses to sign a waiver offinancial claims. This lack of a waiver has been the basis for the Sovietauthorities' refusal to let Julia go and the Stolars refuse to leave withoutJulia. Let's examine the need for this affidavit. Article 77 of the Soviet familyand marriage laws states that ``Adult children must support disabled parentswho need help, and see to their needs.'' It is my understanding that thepurpose of this law is to ensure that any person in need has the rightto his or her child's financial support. Now, this seems perfectly reasonable that family members have a responsibilityto one another. Families should stick together. Unfortunately, it seemsthe Soviets apply this law arbitrarily: In this instance against an individualthe Soviet government wishes to keep at home despite her wishes to emigrate.The law, therefore, is used unfairly and to discriminate. For many reasons,which I will go into in subsequent days, this law should not be the reasonfor which Julia can't leave the Soviet Union. There is no legitimate reason the Stolars should not be able to leave theSoviet Union as a family.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>andCx.1;<CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213></ITAG>[S16MY8-1083]{S5971}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S16MY8-1084]{S5971}NATIONAL H<ITAG tagnum="81">NATIONAL HOSPICE MONTH</ITAG>[S16MY8-1085]{S5971}D'AMATO<ITAG tagnum="10">andCx.1; Mr. D'AMATO.

Mr. President, both yesterday and today saw the testingof important new technology that may someday increase the speed and comfortof passenger rail travel within the Northeast corridor.On May 12 and 13 the National Railroad Passenger Corporation [Amtrak] testedtilt and turbo rail technology in an effort to prove the feasibility ofusing these innovative designs to improve passenger rail service alongthe Northeast corridor. Additional testing is scheduled for September.Mr. President the Northeast corridor accounted for over 50 percent of allpassenger rail traffic in the United States last year. The introductionof new technology along this corridor will effect the quality of life formany Americans.A little over 10 years ago, Congress initiated a $2.5 billion Federal investmentto substantially upgrade rail service along the Northeast corridor. In1987, Congress continued to demonstrate its commitment to this vital transportationartery by directing Amtrak to carry-out tests of tilt and turbo technology.I consider it a privilege to have helped lead the way in this congressionalcommitment to passenger rail travel. Twenty-six years <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ago <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I stood on this floor and spoke of the need to developthe full potential of rail service within the Northeast corridor. Sincethat time <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> have worked to nurture the Northeast corridor asa vital transportation resource.Mr. President, I am proud of my commitment and the commitment of Congressin promoting the progress of passenger rail service in the Northeast corridor.I am equally proud of the role the State of Rhode Island is playing asone of the testing sites for this innovative rail technology.This existence of a testing program for tilt and turbo rail technologyis also the result of efforts by the Coalition of Northeastern GovernorsHigh Speed Rail Task Force. The task force is headed by Massachusetts Gov.Michael Dukakis and Connecticut Gov. William O'Neill. They and the staffof the High Speed Rail Task Force should be commended for their efforts.Joining with the task force in conducting this testing program is the FederalRailroad Administration and Amtrak, who also deserve our thanks for workingto improve passenger rail service within the increasingly utilized Northeastcorridor.andCx.1;<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="9">0[S16MY8-1098]{S5972}F</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="66">F<CODE-213>5</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="9">0[S16MY8-1099]{S5972}AMERICANS </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT<CODE-213>5</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="9">0[S16MY8-1100]{S5972}RIEGLE</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">andCx.1; Mr. RIEGLE.

Enactmentof this legislation is needed to guarantee civil rights and nondiscriminationto all Americans, including those with disabilities.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="1">1S. 2345 establishes a comprehensive national mandate to eliminatediscrimination against persons with disabilities. currently, people withdisabilities are not covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or by theFair Housing Act of 1968. I believe we must correct<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>this inequity by enacting the Americans With DisabilitiesAct, which would grant people with disabilities the same protection asthat enjoyed other persons on the basis of race, sex, national origin andreligion.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1Mr. President, such protection is long overdue.

Mr. President, over the course of the last few weeks, I havecome to the Senate floor to make remarks concerning the current statusof the Japanese-United States relationship. In remarks on April 29, 1988,I spoke to my colleagues about recent developments in Japanese domesticpolitics and made the point that the recent ascendancy of Noboru Takeshitato the position of <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>P<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rime Minister did not represent a major change inthe course of the Japanese Government. I also pointed out to the Senatethat domestic Japanese political considerations are in the forefront ofall governmental decision-making and that the United States must beginto pay more attention to internal Japanese developments if we are ever<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>hope that the foreign and trade policies of Japanare to be reshaped. This morning, in the Wall Street Journal, there appeared a fascinatingarticle written by Mr. Koichi Kato, a member of the Japanese Diet. In thisarticle, which I will ask unanimous consent to insert in the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Record, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>in full upon the completion of my remarks, Mr. Katoconfirms my understanding of the current situation with respect to domesticpolitics in Japan and points out the role of the executive council of theruling Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Mr. President, we, in America, must become more aware of the function ofthe LDP's executive committee. No change in Japanese foreign or domesticpolicy will ever occur without the consent of the Executive Committee.In fact, Mr. Kato points out that in the last 30 years, only two majorpolicy decisions have been made by a majority vote of the LDP's membersin the Diet. The time has arrived for us to begin to learn about the executive committeeand I suggest that we start by beginning a series of discussions with Membersof the Diet and the committees of the LDP in which we in the Congress canexamine the role and operation of the executive committee and the PARCsubcommittees. Without such knowledge, Mr. President, we are destined tocontinue to be unable to understand the development of domestic and internationalpolicies by the Japanese Government. I ask unanimous consent that the article to which I referred be printedin the <T4>Record.</T4> There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the<T4>Record, </T4>as follows: [S16MY8-1165]{S5973}[From the <ITAG tagnum="71">[From the Wall Street Journal, May 16, 1988] </ITAG>[S16MY8-1166]{S5973}MakingInt<ITAG tagnum="74">Making Internationalists Out of Domestic Politic<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ans </ITAG>[S16MY8-1167]{S5973}(By Koichi<ITAG tagnum="71">(By Koichi Kato) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``The fact that I campaigned for Kiichi Miyazawa, one of last year'scontenders for what is now Prime Minister No<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>bo<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ru Takeshita's position, is no secret. But shouldyou ask if I thought Japanese politics would be much different had Mr.Mi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>azawa won, I would have to objectively and somewhatregretfully say ``no.'' The reason lies in the gap between our desire toimprove Japan's cooperative relationships abroad and the constraints ofour domestic politics. The gap between the best policies, internationally,and the necessary policies, when domestic and international pressures areconsidered, is a common problem of democracies. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For some years, Japan has been urging the U.S. to put its fiscal housein order, because, of course, this is also in our best interest. SinceJapan has had<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> its own fiscal austerity program, we have<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> a hard time understanding why it is so difficultfor the U.S. to do the same. Americans, on the other hand, are frustratedwith the slowness of Japanese changes in trade and <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>m<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>acroeconomic policies that many Japanese agree areneeded. American statements that do not take into account the realitiesof Japanese domestic politics hit a stone wall. That is why ``Japan-bashing''basically does not work. Sometimes it seems to create progress, but infact a more sophisticated approach would yield better results with muchless cost to our relationship. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Although Japan's political problems are basically the same as thosein any democracy, there are important differences in style. For example,policies in Japan are rarely decided by a public process of majority voting.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In my Liberal Democratic Party, for instance, the rule against theuse of a simple vote in decision-making is absolute. The party's ExecutiveCouncil, its highest decision-making body, reviews not only the personneland policy matters of the party, but also all bills destined to be submittedby the government to the Diet. Compromises are made, just as when a billgoes through the U.S. Congress. But in the Japanese case, these changesare not decided by voting. In the 30-year history of LDP, only two policyquestions have been decided by majority vote. Both involved China<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>_<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>one was the normalization of realtions and the otherwas an aviation agreement. In these cases, the consensus was for a pro-Chinaposture.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">How is compromise achieved? It begins with informal negotiations behindthe scenes, a process we call ne<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ma<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>washi. As it proceeds it allows for ``letting offsteam,'' which we call ga<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>su<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> nuki, to permit the venting of views for constituencypurpo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>es. A<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ain I think there are close parallels in the U.S.with ``sense of the Congress'' resolutions or amendments that are allowedin the bills on the floor but are intended to be dropped in conferencecommittees. In Japan, the interested members gradually are persuaded toentrust the final decisions to a leadership group including appropriatecommittee chairmen. The process ends when the remaining opponents are encouragedto absent themselves from the vote.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A key part of this process is to make sure that opponents ``take awalk.'' Because the opposition is thus silenced, it often appears fromthe outside that ultimate deci<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>si<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ons are unanimous. But in Japan, a consensus doesnot imply unanimity. Another rule of party policy making is that once thedecision has been made, it is bi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nd<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ing. It is a cardinal rule of the party that no LDPmember, no matter how unhappy, may vote against it. Those who are unhappyabsent themselves from the vote and tell their constituents that they foughtthe best they could, but it was the fault of bureaucrats. In the U.S. too,the executive branch often serves as a scapegoat for congressmen.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Setting the producer's price for rice is a good example. When thisprice is negot<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ia<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ted annually, we have daily meetings lasting fromearly morning until late at night for a week or more. These meetings areattended by close to half of our 440 LDP Diet members. It is not surprising,therefore, that agricultural trade issues are so controversial in U.S.-Japanrelations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">You are probably wondering how foreign interests can get a hearingin this process. Japan, of course, is often criticized for focusing exclusivelyon its own interests while failing to contribute to international interests.Japanese politicians, however, increasingly recognize that actions in accordwith international interests are often in the best interest of Japan. Forexample, although it is not well-known, the Japanese government, unlikeany European ally, has been paying a portion of the salaries of Japaneseemployees on U.S. bases in Japan since 1978. Japan also is seeking to supportthe U.S. mili<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ary presence in the Persian Gulf indirectly by contributingmore to the support of U.S. troops in Japan. Another area which Japan israpidly increasing its international efforts is in the field of foreignassistance. Our foreign assistance will double over a five-year periodthat began in 1986, and we plan to recycle $20 billion in untied loansto developing countries. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">How then can we move forward incrementally to promote better U.S.-Japanrelations in the delicate trade and monetary areas? One way to improvethis situation is to scale down unrealistic rhetoric and approach the Japanesepolitical process in a more sophisticated manner. Americans should understandthat Diet members who have construction companies in their districts arenot going to state that they support hiring foreign firms to do Japanesegovernment public-works projects. They would no sooner do this than a congressmanfrom Detroit would stand up and say that in the interest of free tradehe wants to end restraints on auto imports. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Admittedly, it is difficult to instruct domestic interest groups anddomestically oriented politicians on how to operate most effectively toinfluence a foreign political process. One constructive possibility mightbe to encourage direct discussions among those who <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>are stro<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ngly associated with domestic interests. If thiskind of exchange among politicians becomes possible, I believe the frictionsbetween the U.S. and Japan can be reduced and a stronger bilateral relationshipof trust and cooperation can be built. Of course, we on the Japanese sidewould have to understand that U.S. politicians would continue to introducebills we don't like, but we would know that those bills are often for publicconsumption or to present an initial position. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Ultimately, of course, the act of reconciling domestic pressures andinternational responsibilities is the individual responsibility of eachof us in the political world. That is why it's important that more polit<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>cians, especially domestically oriented politicians,participate in the Trilateral Commission and similar international organizations.Politicians need to think in broad terms. World peace and internationalprosperity depend on politicians with a vision that rises above the narrowconfines of domestic constituencies<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>5</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="9">0[S16MY8-1168]{S5974}F </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="66">F <CODE-213>5</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="9">0[S16MY8-1169]{S5974}BRING ABE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">BRING ABE STOLAR HOME <CODE-213>5</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="9">0[S16MY8-1170]{S5974}LEVIN</ITAG>Mr. LEVIN.
