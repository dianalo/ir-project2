SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Soviet Union apparently ``approved and maybe orchestrating'' delivery of Soviet bloc weapons and equipment toNicaragua despite pledges to halt its own shipments of weapons,Pentagon officials said Thursday.   ``If present trends continue, 1989 could exceed 1988 in totaltonnage and dollar value of Sovet bloc military shipments toNicaragua,'' the Pentagon said in a report.   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev told President Bush in Maythat the Soviet Union had suspended weapons shipments to Nicaraguaat the end of 1988.   However, the Soviet Union has sent the leftist government inManagua some $500 million in various other forms of military aidthis year, U.S. officials have said.   ``Evidence is circumstantial, but we believe the Soviets haveapproved and may be orchestrating the delivery of Soviet blocklethal aid to the Sandinistas through Cuba,'' the Pentagon said.   ``It is unlikely that either the Eastern bloc nations or Cubawould act on their own _ in contravention of clearly articulatedSoviet policy _ to boost military shipments to Nicaragua.''   The Pentagon said that during the first nine months of thisyear, Soviet military deliveries are ``down by about 50 percent,but Eastern bloc deliveries have increased by about 35 percent,essentially offsetting the decrease.''   In addition, deliveries from Cuba to Nicaragua _ primarily ofsmall arms and ammunition _ are ``almost double the amountdelivered in the same period in 1988,'' the report said.   The Pentagon said it doesn't believe Cuba has the capability ofproducing the quantities of weapons being shipped to Nicaragua.While some could be from Cuban stocks, the report said, ``we judgethat for the most part these arms and ammunition are beingtransshipped from the Soviet Union through Cuba.''   Since the Central American peace accords were signed in August1987, the report said the Sandinistas have received ``some 36,500metric tons of Soviet bloc military aid valued at $1.045 billion,''allowing Managua to field the ``largest and most powerful armedforce in Central America.''   The Eastern bloc shipments include surface-to-air missiles,armed transport helicopters, a MI-25 HIND attack helicopter, NorthKorean patrol boats and ``a record number of vehicles, includingradar and communications trucks,'' the report said.   The study strikes a discordant note amid the thaw in U.S.-Sovietrelations, which appeared particularly upbeat after the Wyomingmeeting last month between Secretary of State James A. Baker IIIand Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.   ``Our problem has to do with an increase in Soviet bloc weaponsand military equipment going into Central America, going intoNicaragua, quite frankly, and from Nicaragua to the FMLN(guerrillas) in El Salvador,'' Baker said after the meeting.   ``Most of that is coming from Cuba, and we would simply like tosee the Soviet Union do as much as it possibly could with Cuba tostop that flow.''   Shevardnadze went to Nicaragua and Cuba after the Wyomingsession, and U.S. officials said they understood he tried to usehis influence to reduce the flow of weapons and equipment.   The Pentagon report reflects a review of shipments from 1979until Oct. 1, and would therefore not reflect any change sinceShevardnadze's visit.   Nicaragua continues to arm ``far in excess of its legitimatedefensive needs'' and apparently intends to beef up its militarystores and use the supplies against Contra forces, as well as tosupport rebels in El Salvador and Panamanian leader Gen. ManuelAntonio Noriega, the report said.   The United States halted its shipments to the Contras inFebruary.   In 1988, the report said, there were 68 Soviet bloc and Cubanarms shipments to Nicaragua, amounting to 19 metric tons at anestimated cost of $515 million. In the first nine months of thisyear, there were 55 such shipments, amounting 14 metric tons valuedat $414 million.   Since 1979, the Soviet bloc, Cuba and North Korea have providedNicaragua with some 152,500 metric tons of military equipment at anestimated value of $3.16 billion, the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
