Progress of some automated systemsfor load dispatching stations, power stations, substations and distributionsystems are described, and the system linkage functions of the presenttotal automated system are outlined which has been developing for fiveyears and in composed of 7 millions steps program. The following maindevelopment subjects are described: the automated accident release systemcapable of operating both a load dispatching station and a substation,the automated production system of equipment operation procedures witha decision table prepared in advance, the high speed graphic displaysystem capable of superimposing a distribution diagram over a streetmap, the signal carrier system by the use of distribution lines, andthe interface system connecting different kinds of computers. As futuresubjects for thr total automated system, the simplification and standardizationof each service, the standardization of each system, the improvementof software engineering, and total cost reduction are described.
