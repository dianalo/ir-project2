(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge today ordered three UnitedMine Workers strike organizers jailed for violating his ban onsit-down demonstrations designed to block coal delivery trucks.   U.S. District Judge Glen Williams said his May 24 orderprohibiting the demonstrations against Pittston Coal Group had beenignored, and found strike coordinators Marty Hudson, Jackie Stumpand C.A. Phillips in contempt of court. About 1,500 miners inVirginia and West Virginia have been on strike against Pittstonsince April 5, after a year of working without a contract.   Evidence presented last week showed the three UMW officialsorchestrated the sit-down demonstrations in front of Pittston'smines and coal plants, the judge said.   The defendants, taking the 5th Amendment, declined to testify ontheir own behalf, saying their statements might be used againstthem in other strike-related court cases.   Stump did tell the judge that he had tried everything he couldto make sure the strike remained peaceful and that he will continueto do so.   Williams told the three officials that they will remain in jailuntil they promise to halt the illegal strike activity.   ``The purpose of this hearing was to get obedience to my order,in other words, undo what you have done,'' he said. ``The purposeof sending you to jail is not to punish you but to make sure youcomply with my order.''   On Friday, a state judge, Circuit Court Judge Donald McLaughlin,fined the union $3 million for breaking his ban on mass picketingand sit-down demonstrations in southwestern Virginia.</TEXT></DOC>
