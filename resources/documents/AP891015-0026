The guerrillas claim they already have taken frontline positionsat Svey Chek. The offensive began Saturday, and all day the areareverberated with hundreds of artillery blasts.   More than 1,000 guerrillas were seen Saturday trekking on theroads to Svey Chek from the recently captured towns of Thmar Puok,Banteay Chmar and Kandoul. Following them were convoys of peoplecarrying ammunition and more than 50 ox carts full of ammunition,mortars, rockets and anti-tank weapons.   The Khmer People's National Liberation Front claimed it seizedThmar Puok and Banteay Chmar, along Highway 69 leading to Sisophon,and Kandoul, just west of the highway, days after launching a``general offensive'' on Sept. 30.   A 16-hour, 94-mile tour Saturday of the towns and severalcaptured artillery bases showed they were firmly under theLiberation Front's control.   Field commanders said the Liberation Front was attacking SveyChek in uncommon coordination with its two partners in theresistance coalition, the Khmer Rouge and the forces of PrinceNorodom Sihanouk.   The guerrillas are trying to topple the government Vietnaminstalled after it invaded Cambodia in late 1978. Their attacksintensified after Vietnam made what it called the pullout of itslast troops from Cambodia on Sept. 26.   Capturing Sisophon, a major military base for operations innorthwestern Cambodia, would be a major victory for the guerrillas,who have not seized any areas of such significance.   The tour began at a Liberation Front base along the Thai bordersouth of the Dong Ruk mountains, where the guerrillas showed offcaptured equipment _ more than 1,000 automatic rifles, heavymachine guns, mortars, many cases of anti-personnel mines andteletype machines with Soviet lettering.   The journey into Cambodia was on motorcyles, with about 20Liberation Front guerrillas. It was slow and grueling, coveringroads drenched by monsoon rains.   Everywhere were captured artillery positions, virtually allcapable of hitting Site 2, the Liberation Front's major civilianbase just inside Thailand. Three destroyed tanks, four destroyedheavy trucks and heavy artillery guns were abandoned on the roads.   Everywhere were former government soldiers who had defected tothe guerrilla side.   The three captured towns appeared only lightly defended andthere were no signs the guerrillas expected a counteroffensive.   Civilians farmed in the fields, seeming to go about their livesnormally.   The twisted remants of two tanks sat at the edge of BanteayChmar, blasted by anti-tank weapons the guerrillas recentlyacquired. Some guerrillas have said the weapons may change thecourse of the war the way the acquisition of Stinger missiles didfor the guerrillas in Afghanistan.   Children played around the destroyed tanks.   Hundreds of residents greeted the guerrillas arriving in thetown with a religious ceremony, and Liberation Front divisioncommander Gen. Koh Chien made a speech and gave money to a villageheadman and to Buddhist monks.   The town had been guarded by 300 or 400 government soldiers,said village head Ta Rah, 64.   ``The (Liberation Front) attacked and they all left rightaway,'' he said, laughing.   The guerrillas radioed for a car after one motorcyle in theconvoy broke down. The driver of the Soviet-made military transporttruck that arrived was a former government soldier who brought thevehicle when he defected.   Asked if he missed home, he said: ``No. We want to stay with theKPNLF.''   The truck's left front wheel struck a land mine just afterpassing a guerrilla base at San Lo. The mine apparently had beenplanted by government troops as they abandoned the base in a recentguerrilla attack.   Both of the driver's legs were blown off, and he later died.Several passengers, including this reporter, were wounded. Thevehicle burned.</TEXT></DOC>
