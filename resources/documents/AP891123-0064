WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An official newspaper today denounced EastGermany's role in the 1968 invasion that crushed a reform movementin Czechoslovakia, and it said East Germany now should help itsneighbor achieve change.   Also today, the state-run media quoted the head of statesecurity, Wolfgang Schwanitz, as blaming the past party and stateleadership for ``deformation'' of the security force.   The government detailed new laws to curb smuggling of goodsacross the border in an effort to prevent further decay of thetroubled economy.   The newspaper Der Morgan published a surprisingly candid reporton how East Germany helped suppress the popular democratic revoltin Czechoslovakia, known as the ``Prague Spring,'' 21 years ago.   ``We must help our southern neighbor to find the courage forreform, as much as we need it ourselves,'' said the newspaper,which is run by the Liberal Democratic Party. The party hasrecently dislodged itself from a cluster of Communist-controlledpolitical groups.   ``We recall our own inglorious role in 1968, when East Germantroops with their invasion stomped on the tiny sprouts of renewaland democracy,'' it said.   East Germans have made supportive statements about the swellingpro-democracy movement in Czechoslovakia in recent days, but DerMorgan's report was the first to acknowledge the part played byEast Germany in suppressing the previous reform drive.   The official ADN news agency quoted Schwanitz as sayinghard-line leaders in the past hurt the security service.   ``Discussion with those who thought differently was rejected outof fear that to do so would mean recognizing them,'' ADN quotedSchwanitz as saying. Instead, opponents were subjected to``administrative fighting,'' a euphemism for official harassment,he said.   The Communist Party's longtime leader, Erich Honecker, wasousted Oct. 18 amid an exodus of hundreds of thousands of EastGermans dissatisfied with his orthodox rule. Honecker was replacedby Egon Krenz, who has opened East Germany's borders and indicatedhe is open to some reforms.   Government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said new measures to countersmuggling of consumer goods and black-market sales of currency andartworks abroad include strict border checks and a requirement thatpurchasers in East Germany show identity cards to buy heavilysubsidized goods, such as textiles, food and electronics.   The move was apparently aimed at many Poles who travel to EastGermany to buy goods and take them back across the border toPoland, where prices have skyrocketed this year.   Meyer said the government would not consider devaluation of theEast German mark as part of the recovery effort _ a step seen asnecessary by many Western economists if East Berlin seeks tobolster its economy.   New Forum, the leading pro-democracy reform group, issued astatement today calling on East Germans to renounce currencyspeculation, sales of artworks and other black-market activitiesthat damage the economy.   ``Take no part in the sellout of our nation,'' the citizensgroup declared in the statement carried by ADN.   On Wednesday, Politburo member Wolfgang Herger indicated duringa public discussion that at least some members of the Communistelite were willing to do away with one-party rule.   Herger, who is responsible for security matters, said the``dogmatic, distorted model of the political system should bechanged in theory as well as practice.''   Acknowledging their lack of credibility among people who havetaken to the streets by the hundreds of thousands to demand theirouster, the ruling Communists announced Wednesday their willingnessto open talks with the opposition.   Poland's Communists opened such talks in February, agreeing inthem to reinstate Solidarity's legal status and hold partially freeelections. Now, Solidarity leads the Warsaw government.</TEXT></DOC>
