The deal will bring RJR Nabisco close to its goal of divesting$5.5 billion in assets to raise cash and reduce debt amassed in its$24.53 billion leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.,spokesman David Kalis said Wednesday.   Tabacalera SA, which administers Spain's tobacco monopoly, willbuy RJR Nabisco's 50.5 percent interest in three Spanish foodcompanies: Galletas Artiach SA; Marbu SA; and Nabisco Brands EspanaSA.   Tabacalera already had owned the portion of the three businessesthat RJR Nabisco didn't own. In 1987, Tabacalera bought a 49.5percent stake in the food companies.   Also under the agreement, Tabacalera will buy Nabisco's whollyowned Nabisco Brands Portugal Comercio E Industria LTDA and certaintrademark rights in Spain and Portugal.   The companies sold to Tabacalera market a range of foodproducts, such as biscuits, baking powder, flour, puddings and cakemixes.   RJR Nabisco began its asset sales earlier this year afterKohlberg Kravis completed its acquisition of the food and tobaccogiant.   Kohlberg Kravis agreed to sell $5.5 billion in assets in returnfor financing the deal, which was the most expensive takeover inhistory.
