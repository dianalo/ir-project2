(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   International Business Machines Corp.says it isn't getting out of the copier busienss in agreeing tohave Eastman Kodak Co. sell and service IBM copiers, but thecomputer giant acknowledges copiers are not as crucial to it as inthe past.   Kodak will take over existing rental agreements and within ayear will replace the IBM nameplate on the company's three machineswith a Kodak logo, IBM spokesman Andy Russell said Tuesday.   Kodak will continue selling its Ektaprint line of copiers, someof which directly compete with IBM machines. Kodak already sells aCanon-made copier under its Ektaprint brand.   ``Copiers are not as crucial as they were in the past. They'renot attachable to our systems, but today our emphasis is onintegrating systems ... personal computers and printers,'' Russellsaid.   However, Russell said from the company's headquarters in Armonk,N.Y., that IBM would continue utilizing its copier development andmanufacturing abilities. He also said that giving up the copiersales and service aspects would allow IBM to concentrate oncomputers and printers.   Kodak, IBM and Xerox Corp. are the dominant copier companies inthe expensive, high-volume, copying segment, according to industrystatistics compiled by Dataquest Inc., a San Jose, Calif.-basedmarket research firm.   Of the 29,400 machines owned or rented last year in the segment,which includes machines that make 70 or more copies a minute, Xeroxhad 14,400, IBM had 6,000 and Kodak had 4,700.   Kodak and IBM also sell copiers that operate in the mid-volumerange of 45 to 69 copies a minute, said Mary Lou Demers, a copierindustry analyst at Dataquest.   The agreement announced Tuesday, which must be approved byfederal regulators, pertains only to machines in the United States.Negotiations for a similar agreement in other countries are underway.   For Kodak, the deal is a great chance to grab IBM's loyalcustomer base, something the photo giant and others have beenunsuccessfully trying to do for years, said Demers.   ``It will be interesting to see what happens as the salesagreements run out and it's time to renew,'' Demers said. ``We'llsee if Kodak can retain that same loyalty.''   She said she was not surprised at Tuesday's announcement.   ``People in the industry have been wondering for several yearswhether IBM was either going to introduce some brand new machine orget out of the business,'' Demers said.</TEXT></DOC>
