Under a contract with the state of Nebraska, thecollections consultant is looking for parents who skip out onchild-support payments. &quot;From the business view, thepossibilities are unlimited,&quot; says Mr. Morledge, of GrandIsland, Neb. &quot;There are hundreds of millions of dollarsowed.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Try billions. The U.S. Bureau of the Census reported that$14.6 billion was due in child support payments in 1987, themost recent year for which figures are available, and that$4.6 billion, or 32% of the total, went unpaid that year.More recent figures, scheduled to be released in a few weeks,aren't expected to show much change.   Collecting child-support payments has been a governmentfunction historically. But now, with the federal governmentpressuring states to increase collections and help pare theranks of single-parent families on welfare, a growing numberof state and local agencies are turning to the private sectorto get the job done.   Much is at stake. States that don't reach federally setgoals for such activities as locating scofflaws andestablishing paternity will lose between 1% and 5% of theirannual welfare subsidies.   Enlisting the help of the private sector &quot;is a survivalissue,&quot; says Holli Ploog, a senior vice president forchild-support services in Lockheed Corp.'sinformation-management services unit. &quot;We're talking aboutsome significant dollars the states stand to lose.&quot;   Ohio lost a record $6.6 million in federal welfaresubsidies last year because it failed to meet U.S. guidelinesfor establishing paternity and child-support obligations andfor using state and federal parent-locater services,according to the Office of Child Support Enforcement in theU.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Penalties ofabout $600,000 each have been assessed against the Districtof Columbia and New Mexico, according to a spokesman for thechild-support office.   In the early 1980s, that wouldn't have been much of aproblem. &quot;It used to be that the agencies would just go tothe state legislatures and get more employees,&quot; says Ms.Ploog, who was director of the federal child-supportenforcement program in Alaska when she was recruited to headLockheed's foray into child-support work.   But in an era of tightening budgets, states are enlistingprivate industry to increase efficiency and cut costs. In LosAngeles, the county treasurer's office and the countySheriff's Department recently lost out to private companieson bids to handle child-support collections and the servingof legal papers, respectively, for the bureau of familysupport operations in the Los Angeles County districtattorney's office.   Some privatization decisions have federal muscle behindthem. All states are required to automate their child-supportrecords by 1995 under rules adopted by Congress in 1988.Boston-based Digital Equipment Corp., which landed an earlyautomation contract for child-support services in Michigan,estimates that state and local agencies will be seeking bidsfor $200 million of automation contracts over the next 18months. &quot;It's a very major piece of business,&quot; says a Digitalspokeswoman.   Los Angeles's automation contract, valued at $16 million,went to Lockheed's information-management services unit. Theautomated system will replace the current practice of postingpayments and other data entries by hand in Los Angeles's270,000 child-support cases. The current system keepsemployees busy on routine cases, leaving little time to trackdown scofflaws, says Wayne Doss, director of the Los Angelesbureau of family support operations.   While it is still too early to gauge the private sector'seffectiveness, child-support specialists say it is making theprocess more professional. In Nebraska and Arizona, forinstance, child-support caseworkers have been trained by Mr.Morledge's Morledge andamp; Associates in professional locationtechniques, including the use of credit reporting services totrack down missing parents.   Nebraska has also enlisted a public-relations concern topublicize the availability of automatic-fund transfersystems, which allow parents to have child-support paymentsdeducted directly from their bank accounts.   But while activity is clearly increasing, thechild-support field isn't necessarily a joy ride for theprivate sector. Companies that have taken the plunge mustsweat out low returns or even losses in the hope that theycan pick up enough market share to make the businessprofitable.   &quot;It's often more than a year from the time you find outabout something to when you see revenue,&quot; says William Rust,project manager for the Electronic Parent Locater Network,which enables a child-support caseworker in one state to tapinto a neighboring state's unemployment and auto-registrationrecords to track down a missing parent. The network is aproject of Dallas-based Affiliated Computer Systems Inc.,which has a longstanding and long-term commitment to operateit for 10 Southeastern states.   But, Mr. Rust says, there's a payoff in the child-supportbusiness that goes beyond the bottom line. A 1988 study ofthe locater network by the accounting firm of Deloitte andamp;Touche found that the system helped participating states trim75 days off the average time it takes to locate a missingparent.   &quot;That translates to 2.5 child support payments,&quot; Mr. Rustsays. &quot;We're helping out moms and kids and still doing workin the private sector.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
