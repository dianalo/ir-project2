Background</ITAG>A. Rebundling of Hospital ServicesThe Social Security Amendments of 1965 (Pub. L. 89-97) established titleXVIII of the Social Security Act (the Act), which authorized the establishmentof the Medicare program to pay part of the costs of health care servicesfurnished to eligible beneficiaries. Part A of the program (Hospital Insurance)provides basic health insurance protection against the costs of inpatienthospital care and other inpatient or home health care. Part B of the program(Supplementary Medical Insurance) provides voluntary supplementary insurancecovering most physicians' services and certain other items and servicesnot covered under Part A, including hospital outpatient services.Prior to the enactment of the Social Security Amendments of 1983 (Pub.L. 98-21) on April 7, 1983, which established the Medicare prospectivepayment system for inpatient hospital services, nonphysician services providedto Medicare beneficiaries who were hospital patients were generally billedby the hospitals. However, under certain circumstances, the statute permittedpayments to be made to an outside supplier or another provider for nonphysicianservices that were furnished to a hospital patient. When payments weremade under these circumstances, some nonphysician services were billedas hospital services in one hospital and billed by an outside supplierin another. The practice of billing by suppliers outside the hospital forthese services has been referred to in the legislative history as ``unbundling''of hospital services.Since the enactment of Pub. L. 98-21 and the publication of implementingregulations on September 1, 1983 (48 FR 39752), the Medicare program hasrequired that nonphysician services furnished to hospital inpatients becovered and paid for under Medicare as hospital services. This practiceof covering nonphysician services furnished to hospital inpatients by anoutside supplier as hospital services is referred to as ``rebundling''.Under the prospective payment system for inpatient hospital services, asingle uniform payment is made for a case based on the diagnosis-relatedgroup (DRG) to which the cases is assigned. Rebundling ensures that theDRG payments to all hospitals cover a comparable ``bundle'' of servicesrelated to the hospital stay. Specifically, Pub. L. 98-21 added section 1862(a)(14) to the Act to prohibitpayment for services (other than physicians' services) furnished to aninpatient of a hospital by an entity other than the hospital, unless theservices are furnished under an arrangement (as defined in section 1861(w)(1)of the Act). (Section 1861(w)(1) of the Act specifies that the term ``arrangements''is limited to arrangements under which receipt of payment by the hospitalor other provider for Medicare covered services to an individual dischargesthe liability of the individual or any other person to pay for the services.)Pub. L. 98-21 also added section 1866(a)(1)(H) to the Act to provide thata hospital will be eligible to participate in the Medicare program onlyif the hospital agrees to furnish to inpatients either directly or underan arrangement all Medicare covered items and services, other than physicians'services.Regardless of whether the hospital furnishes the services directly or arrangesfor their provision, the hospital assumes financial responsibility forthe services. The Medicare program makes payment only to hospitals, andnot to providers or suppliers that furnish inpatient services on behalfof the hospitals.In Pub. L. 98-21, Congress addressed only nonphysician services providedto Medicare beneficiaries who are hospital <T3>inpatients</T3> and did not address at that time nonphysician servicesprovided to Medicare beneficiaries who are hospital <T3>outpatients,</T3> for which payment is made on a cost basis under PartB of Medicare. Thus, services to hospital outpatients continued to be unbundledin some hospitals. Subsequently, in section 9343(c) of the Omnibus BudgetReconciliation Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-509, enacted October 21, 1986),Congress extended the rebundling provision to all nonphysician servicesfurnished to hospital <T3>patients,</T3> thus including nonphysician services provided to Medicarebeneficiaries who are hospital outpatients.Sections 9343(c)(1) and (c)(2) of Pub. L. 99-509 amended sections 1862(a)(14)and 1866(a)(1)(H) of the Act, respectively. As revised, section 1862(a)(14)of the Act prohibits payment for nonphysician services furnished to hospitalpatients (inpatients and outpatients), unless the services are furnishedby the hospital, either directly or under an arrangement (as defined insection 1861(w)(1) of the Act). As revised, section 1866(a)(1)(H) of theAct requires each Medicare participating hospital to agree to furnish directlyall covered nonphysician services required by its patients, or to havethe services furnished under an arrangement (as defined in section 1861(w)(1)of the Act).Another provision of Pub. L. 99-509 made changes that affect our implementationof the rebundling mandate. Section 9338(a)(3) of Pub. L. 99-509 amendedsection 1861(s)(2)(K) of the Act by permitting services of physician assistantsto be covered and billed separately.Rebundling of outpatient hospital services would provide a basis for developinga prospective payment methodology for outpatient hospital services. Section9343(f) of Pub. L. 99-509 amended section 1135 of the Act to require theSecretary to submit an interim report to Congress by April 1, 1988 concerningdevelopment of a fully prospective payment system for ambulatory surgery.A final report is due to Congress no later than April 1, 1989, with recommendationsconcerning implementation of a fully prospective payment mechanism forambulatory surgery services by October 1, 1989. We are also required todevelop a model system for prospective payment of outpatient hospital servicesother than ambulatory surgical procedures and submit a report to Congressconcerning the model system by January 1, 1991.So that we may be able to develop a prospective payment system for ambulatorysurgery and other hospital outpatient services, it is necessary to haveavailable clear and consistent rules about the range of services that wouldbe included in such a payment system. Current policies on coverage of hospitaloutpatient services permit these services to be unbundled, and thus allowproviders to vary their practices concerning provision of services. Congressrecognized the inconsistencies of the current payment system and requiredrebundling as a first step toward payment reform.B. OIG Civil Money Penalty AuthorityThe Department's OIG is authorized under sections 1128(c) and 1128A ofthe Act, and through implementing regulations at 42 CFR Part 1003, to imposeadministratively civil money penalties, assessments, and suspensions againstany person who files false or certain other improper claims under Medicare,Medicaid, or Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant programs. Underthis authority, the OIG, in certain situations, may fine violators up to$2,000 as a penalty for each false or improper item or service, and imposean additional assessment of up to twice the amounts falsely claimed foreach item or service. In addition, a person found liable for a penaltymay also be suspended from Medicare or Medicaid program participation forappropriate periods of time.In order to deter the unbundling of nonphysician hospital outpatient services,sections 9343(c)(3) of Pub. L. 99-509 and 4085(i)(17) of Pub. L. 100-203further amended section 1866 of the Act. Specifically, this authority providesfor the imposition of a penalty, not to exceed $2,000, against any personwho knowingly and willfully presents, or causes to be presented, a billor request for payment for a hospital outpatient service under Part B ofMedicare that violates the billing arrangement under section 1866(a)(1)(H)of the Act, or the requirement for an arrangement. While the statute requiresthat a penalty be imposed in the same manner as other penalty billing violationscurrently imposed under section 1128A of the Act, it does not provide forassessments or for suspensions based on a penalty determination.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations</ITAG>A. Rebundling of Hospital Outpatient ServicesCurrent Medicare regulations (42 CFR 405.310(m)) implement the statutoryrequirement for rebundling of inpatient hospital services by excludingfrom coverage nonphysician services furnished to hospital inpatients byan entity other than the hospital, unless the services are furnished underarrangement. The current exclusion from coverage does not apply to physicians'services that meet the conditions for payment in 42 CFR 405.550(b), orservices of anesthetists employed by physicians that meet the conditionsfor payment in 42 CFR 405.553(b)(4). The exception for physicians' servicesis required by section 1862(a)(14) of the Act. Services of physician-employedanesthetists were excepted from rebundling as an administrative measureto prevent disruption of long-standing physician-anesthesia team relationships.HCFA would implement the requirement for rebundling of outpatient hospitalservices by amending Medicare regulations (42 CFR 405.310 and Part 410)to exclude from coverage also any services that are furnished in a hospitalto a patient who is not currently an inpatient of a hospital but is registeredby the hospital as an outpatient, by an entity other than the hospitalduring or as a result of an encounter in the hospital, unless the servicesare furnished under arrangement. In addition, HCFA would require rebundlingof those diagnostic procedures or tests (for example, magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) procedures) that are furnished outside the hospital by anentity other than the hospital, but were ordered during an encounter inthe hospital with the patient or as a result of such encounter.As in the case of services to hospital inpatients, and for the same reason,physicians' services that meet the conditions for payment in 42 CFR 405.550(b)would not be subject to rebundling under these proposed regulations. HCFAalso would except services of physician-employed anesthetists that meetthe conditions for payment in 42 CFR 405.553(b)(4) from outpatient rebundling.In addition, the proposed regulations would not apply to physician assistantservices as defined in section 1861(s)(2)(K)(i) of the Act from inpatientand outpatient rebundling. This change is being proposed to help accomplishthe objective of section 1861(s)(2)(K)(i) of the Act, as amended by section9338(a)(3) of Pub. L. 99-509, which permits physician assistants' servicesto be covered and billed separately. We believe section 1861(s)(2)(K) ofthe Act was intended to establish an exception to the rebundling provisionsof Pub. L. 99-509 as they apply to services of physicians' assistants inhospitals. Although this exception is not explicit, to read the statutein any other way would mean that section 1861(s)(2)(K) of the Act wouldhave no meaning with respect to services to hospital patients, a resultthat is contrary to the normal rule of statutory construction that eachprovision of an enactment must be construed to have meaning. In addition,the language of section 1861(s)(2)(K) of the Act describes the servicesaffected as those ``which<T3> would be</T3> physicians' services if furnished by a physician * **'' (emphasis added). We believe this language places the services in thesame generic category as physicians' services, and suggests that they shouldbe treated similarly for rebundling purposes.HCFA would define (in Medicare regulations at andSection; 410.2) the term``encounter'' as a direct personal contact beween a patient and a physician,or other person who is authorized by State licensure law and, where applicable,by hospital staff bylaws to order or provide services for the patient,for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment of the patient. The use of the``encounter'' as a basis for identifying the services to be rebundled isnot specifically required by Pub. L. 99-509, but is needed in order toimplement the rebundling requirement in a uniform and equitable manner,as explained further in section III of this preamble.To ensure that appropriate payment is made for physicians' services andfor the rebundling hospital and other nonphysician services, HCFA wouldrevise the regulations relating to Part B reasonable charge payment (42CFR 405.555 (b) and (c) and 405.556(c)).HCFA would also revise Medicare regulations that set forth the basic commitmentsincluded in the provider agreement (andSection; 489.20). The revised regulationswould clarify the hospital's responsibilities with respect to servicesfurnished to inpatients, and would require a hospital that furnishes servicesto a beneficiary who is not currently an inpatient of a hospital but isregistered by the hospital as an outpatient to agree to either furnishdirectly or make arrangements (in accordance with section 1861(w)(1) ofthe Act) for all items and services for which rebundling is required underthe proposed revision described above, and for which the beneficiary isentitled to have payment made under Medicare.Under the new provisions, if a Medicare outpatient is referred to anotherprovider or supplier for further diagnostic testing or other diagnosticservices as a result of an encounter that occurs in the hospital, the hospitalwould be responsible for arranging with the other entity for the provisionof the services.The hospital also would be responsible for providing or arranging for theprovision of prostheses and prosthetic devices (other than dental) thatreplace all or part of an internal body organ (for example, intraocularlenses (IOLs)) and are implanted or fitted during an encounter. For example,under current policies, the physician who implants an IOL during surgeryconducted on an outatient of a hospital also can be the supplier of theIOL, and is allowed to bill Medicare under Part B for it. Under these proposedregulations, this practice would be prohibited and the hospital would haveto furnish the IOL, either directly or under arrangement (that is, wouldhave to pay for the lens). The same policies would apply to other itemsand services, such as, artificial limbs, knees, and hips; durable medicalequipment (DME); equipment and supplies covered under the prosthetic devicebenefit; and services incident to physicians' services. Thus, hospitalswould be required to assume financial liability for prostheses and prostheticdevices (which are regarded as ``services'' for Medicare coverage purposes)and for other services furnished by an outside entity to their outpatients,and the practice of unbundling these services would be prohibited. Sometimes a hospital may furnish an item or service for which a patientwill have a continued need. For example, a hospital may furnish a DME item(for example, a wheel chair), or a prosthetic device and supplies (forexample, a nasogastric tube and associated supplies). When this situationoccurs, the hospital would be responsible under this regulation for rebundlingthe items and services it furnishes on site. DME is typically paid foron a monthly basis or in a lump sum, and if it is furnished by a hospitalto an outpatient, we would require only the initial charge to be rebundled.Similarly, if a hospital furnishes a nasogastric tube and associated supplies,we would require only the items actually furnished to be rebundled. Inboth of these examples, subsequent charges for equipment rental or supplieswould be billed and considered separately. A patient could continue topurchase them from the hospital or deal with an outside supplier. In view of the short amount of time available for implementing the statutoryrequirements of Pub. L. 99-509, HCFA issued interim instructions in theProvider Reimbursement Manual (HCFA Pub. 15-1) and is preparing interiminstructions for other HCFA manuals. These instructions were effectivefor services furnished on or after July 1, 1987. Upon the publication offinal regulations that implement section 9343(c) of Pub. L. 99-509, HCFAwill revise its program instructions as needed to reflect any differencesbetween those final regulations and the interim instructions. B. Civil Money Penalty for Unbundling Hospital Outpatient Services In order to implement sections 9343(c)(3) of Pub. L. 99-509 and 4085(i)(17)of Pub. L. 100-203, OIG would impose a penalty, not to exceed $2,000, againstany person who knowingly and willfully presents, or causes to be presented,a bill or request for payment for a hospital outpatient service under PartB of Medicare, and that bill or request violates the billing arrangementunder section 1866(a)(1)(H) of the Act, or the requirement for an arrangement.Upon issuance of the final rule, HCFA would refer all cases for possiblepenalty action to the OIG. The method for making referrals to the OIG wouldbe set forth separately in the Part A Intermediary Manual, Part 3 (HCFAPub. 13-3). <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Alternatives Considered</ITAG>The extension of the rebundling provision to outpatient services createsa number of practical difficulties that do not exist in the case of inpatientservices. Because an individual inpatient's admission and discharge datesare entered in the hospital's medical and billing records, the time periodduring which the patient is an inpatient can be readily determined. Inaddition, an individual's access to treatment by other providers or suppliersis inherently limited while he or she is a hospital inpatient. By contrast,one individual may receive treatment on an outpatient basis from two ormore hospitals in the same day, and the services received will not necessarilyhave been ordered by the same physician, or related to the same medicalcondition. It is also not uncommon for a patient who is seen in a hospital'soutpatient department to be referred to another provider or supplier foradditional services or specialized testing. Under these circumstances,determining which services should be rebundled can be difficult.To deal with these problems, HCFA considered rebundling only those servicesthat are not furnished by the hospital directly but are furnished whilethe patient is on site at the hospital. However, this approach would notadequately account for certain services (for example, computerized tomography(CT) scans or MRI procedures available only at and performed by a sourceoutside the hospital) that may be provided as the direct result of a hospitaloutpatient visit and may be integrally related to other services, suchas a physical examination, provided during the visit. Therefore, HCFA didnot adopt this approach.HCFA also considered rebundling all services, whether or not furnishedon site at the hospital, that are required for the diagnosis and treatmentof the medical condition for which the patient sought outpatient care fromthe hospital. Since the same individual may simultaneously be undergoingdifferent courses of treatment for two or more unrelated medical conditions,and may receive services on an ambulatory basis from several providersor suppliers for each condition, making decisions as to which servicesare related to each condition could present almost insurmountable administrativeproblems for hospitals, intermediaries, and carriers. HCFA does not nowhave the information that would be needed to provide reliable guidanceto carriers and intermediaries on which services typically are requiredfor treatment of each condition for which an individual may seek outpatienthospital care. Because of these difficulties, HCFA rejected this approach.To implement the rebundling requirement of section 9343(c) of Pub. L. 99-509while avoiding the difficulties of the two approaches described above,HCFA proposes to use the site of the encounter that resulted in servicesbeing ordered as the key determinant of whether the services must be rebundled.For services provided on site at the hospital to patients who are not currentlyinpatients of a hospital, but are registered by the hospital as outpatients,rebundling would be required if the services were ordered during or asa result of an encounter that occurred at the hospital. For services providedoutside the hospital to such patients, rebundling would be required onlyif the services are diagnostic procedures or tests ordered during or asa result of an encounter at the hospital. We adopted this ``encounter-based''approach to rebundling because we believe it would prevent the unbundlingof services that are integrally related to diagnosis or treatment the hospitalprovides to its patients, and would provide a clinically meaningful andadministratively feasible basis for grouping outpatient services for purposesof eventual development of a prospective payment system for them.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Impact Statement</ITAG>Executive Order 12291 requires us to prepare and publish a regulatory impactanalysis for any major rule. A major rule is defined as any rule that islikely to: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, and local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets. In addition, we generally prepare and publish a regulatory flexibilityanalysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (FRA) (5U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that the rule wouldnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. For purposes of the RFA, States and individuals are not smallentities, but we treat all hospitals and suppliers of medical servicesas small entities.Because it appears likely that this rule would result in a significantincrease in costs for at least some hospitals, we have prepared the followingregulatory flexibility analysis. However, we do not believe that the effectsof this proposed rule, in and of itself, would meet the criteria for amajor rule.We do not have sufficient data to assess fully the magnitude, interaction,and effects of this proposed rule on hospital and supplier behavior. However,we expect the following would result from implementation of this proposedrule.Some items and services for which Part B payment is now made directly tothe supplier would be paid for only if furnished directly by the hospitalor under arrangements. All payments for those services to be rebundledwould be made to the hospital. Payments for some services to outpatientsthat are currently paid on a reasonable charge basis would be made to thehospital on a reasonable cost basis. To the extent that a hospital's costsincrease due to the rebundling of services, the hospital would be ableto claim reimbursement on a reasonable cost basis for the increased costs.Therefore, we do not expect hospitals to incur an increase in unreimbursablecosts.We intend to implement this rule in a manner requiring the least changein billing. There has been some concern that burdensome administrativemeasures would be needed to avoid duplicate payment, or payment for servicesthat are billed in violation of the rebundling provisions. While we expectsome administrative costs due to necessary audits to monitor rebundlingof services, we also expect that once participating hospitals and suppliershave gained the experience to make appropriate changes to their billingpractices, that duplicate payments or noncompliance problems would notoccur more frequently than under current regulations with respect to inpatientservices.We have identified no benefits for hospitals or suppliers resulting directlyfrom this proposal. Hospitals may elect to furnish directly some itemsand services now furnished by other entities, rather than enter into arrangements.This may affect the market position of non-hospital suppliers. We believethat the most frequently affected services would be laboratory tests, X-ray,CT, MRI, and IOLs.Beneficiaries should be benefited by coordinated billing for nonphysicianoutpatient services. Coinsurance liability would be affected only to theextent that rebundling of services results in aggregate charges differentfrom total charges for unbundled services. Beneficiary out-of-pocket expenses,however, may be reduced, since they would not be billed as often for chargesin excess of the Medicare reasonable charge. We plan to apply the ``prudentbuyer'' concept, under which costs in excess of those that would be incurredby a prudent and cost-conscious buyer are not considered reasonable, toensure that rebundling does not unnecessarily increase the costs of servicesfurnished under arrangements to outpatients. For example, if a hospitalpurchases IOLs from a physician or other supplier rather than directlyfrom a manufacturer, the cost recognized as reasonable would not, in theabsence of extenuating circumstances, be allowed to exceed the cost ofpurchasing directly from the manufacturer. Thus, we do not expect programliability for services to increase because of rebundling.In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to preparea regulatory impact analysis for any proposed rule that may have a significantimpact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.Such an analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA.For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospitalas a hospital with fewer than 50 beds located outside a metropolitan statisticalarea. We have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposedregulation would not have a significant economic impact on the operationsof a substantial number of small rural hospitals.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.
