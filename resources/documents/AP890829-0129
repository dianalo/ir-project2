Rival guerrilla groups were reported fighting each other innorthern and western Afghanistan.   In a speech to the opening session of Parliament, President Najibasked the United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to stopinterfering in Afghanistan. The three nations are the guerrillas'main backers.   Government spokesman Mohammed Iqbal said one of the rocketsstruck a house, wounding two people inside, and seven hit theairport but caused no injuries.   Employees and passengers fled the combined civilian-militaryairport and passengers were told to return Wednesday for theirluggage, which was being unloaded when the rockets landed about 100yards away.   Iqbal said the level of fighting between the army and guerrillasin three eastern cities had declined in recent days, and rocketbarrages had replaced close combat.   Soldiers advanced east of Jalalabad, 75 miles east of Kabul, andparried a guerrilla advance on Khost, about 100 miles to thesoutheast, he said. Iqbal also claimed government troops wonvictories around Kandahar in the southeast.   He reported fighting between guerrilla factions around thewestern city of Herat and in the northern provinces of Badakhshan,Takhar and Konduz.   The government spokesman and independent sources said the battleswere between two fundamentalist groups _ Hezb-i-Islami led byGulbuddin Hekmatyar and Jamiat-i-Islami fighters under fieldcommander Ahmad Shah Masood.   At least 22 guerrillas were killed and an unknown number woundedin the foothills and mountains 50 miles east of Herat, Iqbal said.   He said he did not have statistics for the other areas. Theindependent sources in Kabul said serious trouble appeared to bedeveloping between the rival groups.   Jamiat leaders accused Hekmatyar last month of ordering thekillings of at least 30 of its guerrillas in the field, includingsome commanders.   Najib resumed his call for U.N.-supervised elections and said toParliament: ``The aggressive hand of the United States, Saudi Arabiaand Pakistan should be off Afghanistan.''   In a weekend speech in Jalalabad, released in English on Tuesday,Najib said the fighting had changed from a jihad, or holy war, tofratricide.   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April1978. Soviet military forces entered the war in December 1979 andwithdrew in February after more than nine years of involvement.   The main guerrilla groups are based in Pakistan, Afghanistan'seastern neighbor.</TEXT></DOC>
