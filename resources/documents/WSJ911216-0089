Greenspan andamp; Co. have beenhesitantly nibbling at the problem, bringing their discountrate and the federal funds rate down a quarter or a halfpoint at a time. Let them now move more decisively, cuttingmoney market rates one or two full points.   It's an illusion that any one step will &quot;jump-start&quot; arecovery. The economy is not an engine that is sure to goonce ignition occurs. To keep it running neither too slow nortoo fast requires constant attention, indeed fine-tuning likethe Fed's management of the 1983-88 recovery.</LP><TEXT>   Why has the Fed been so hesitant? The main reasons arefear of inflation and fear of the bond markets' fears ofinflation. These worries are irrational. There is plenty ofroom in the economy for expansionary policy. Inflation isabating. Our old nemesis, the price of oil, is quiescent.Utilization of plant capacity is 10% below normal. Althoughthe unemployment rate, just under 7%, is much lower than itspeaks in 1982 (10.6%) and 1975 (9%), it understates theweakness of labor markets. In greater numbers than usual,unemployed workers discouraged by the scarcity of jobs aredropping out of the labor force and employed workers areunwillingly confined to part-time jobs.   Conventional statistical criteria place the recession'sbeginning in the third quarter 1990, when real growth turnednegative. But recession in a more meaningful sense started inspring 1989. For nine quarters real growth was below 2%annual rate, and for the last quarter the preliminaryestimate is 2.4%. Meaningful recovery will not occur untilgrowth consistently surpasses 2.5%, as in 1983-88. That rateis needed just to keep up with labor supply and productivity.Subpar growth for 10 quarters has piled up a gross nationalproduct shortfall of 5%, $300 billion. Barring a miraculousupswing, 1988-92 will show the least growth of any postwarperiod from one presidential election to the next.   The opportunity and need for monetary stimulus are all thegreater because recovery in the 1990s will get little or nohelp from fiscal policy. In the 1980s, President Reagan'sdefense build-up and tax cuts were big serendipitous booststo aggregate demand for goods and labor. Unfortunately, thedebt and deficits they left behind preclude any significantnew fiscal stimulus.   Nevertheless, both the president and members of Congressare trotting out their favorite old tax cuts and expenditureprograms. The trouble is that deficit-neutral measures cannotdeliver much stimulus, and deficit-increasing measures willdo damage later if they are permanent. Temporary tax cuts,refundable personal credits, unemployment insurancesupplements and investment tax credits -- taking effectpromptly and expiring once prosperity is restored -- might beuseful initiatives. But recovery is mainly the Fed's job.   The Fed has lowered the funds rate by more than fourpoints in two years. Rates on long-term bonds, mortgages, andbanks' commercial loans have fallen too, though by less. Butsince inflation rates have also fallen, real interest ratesthat matter to borrowers are still higher than in 1989, andhigher than at recession troughs in pre1980 business cycles.   Many pundits have concluded that expansionary monetarypolicy has lost its punch. They say it is as futile as&quot;pushing on a string.&quot; This is a faulty metaphor. In the1930s and some postwar recession troughs, interest rates wereso close to zero that the Fed couldn't push them lower. Now,the Fed has plenty of room to ease further, about 450 basispoints between present money market rates and zero. Ifstimulus per dose of monetary tonic is now smaller thannormal, just increase the dose.   The two popular reasons for the alleged impotence ofmonetary policy are that banks won't or can't lend and thatpotential borrowers won't or can't borrow.   The first is the &quot;credit crunch,&quot; a misnomer for thecautions of banks and bank regulators. Although ChairmanGreenspan and President Bush are blaming them for theeconomy's doldrums, their prudence is a reasonableconsequence of the recent history of bad loans, many still onbank's books. Banks are grossly undercapitalized. The bufferthat protects depositors or taxpayer-underwritten depositinsurance funds from losses due to bad loans is perilouslythin.   On average, only 6% of commercial bank assets representstockholders' funds. Many banks are below regulators' minimumstandards. Some have negative net worth, and others would ifassets were realistically valued. Big banks have lowercapital ratios than small banks. Commercial banks are morehighly levered than nonbank finance companies, although theyare much more dependent on liabilities payable in short termsor on demand. Until the 1930s, before deposit insuranceenabled bankers to shift the risks of withdrawals to thegovernment, commercial bank capital ratios were 15% andhigher.   No wonder banks are under regulatory pressure to raisetheir capital-to-asset ratios. Given their shaky balancesheets and low or negative profits, they can hardly sellshares or debt securities. Instead, they have to shrink theirassets and liabilitiesby charging more for loans and payingless for deposits. That is why the margins between bankslending rates -- on commercial, consumer and mortgage loans-- and the interest they pay for deposits and federal funds,are twice their normal size.   And that is why many borrowers are turning away frombanks. In 1979, commercial banks originated 32% of the fundsadvanced in credit markets. By 1990 their share had droppedto 23%. The economy can prosper even though banks financeless of it than they used to.   The Bush administration and the banking lobby have so farfailed to persuade Congress to allow commercial banks toenter the investment banking and insurance industries, and tobranch nationwide. Although the proposed reforms mighteventually improve the profitability of bank holdingcompanies, they would not remedy the undercapitalization ofbanks or reverse the decline in their competitiveness.Nudging federally insured banks to take more loan risks isfolly. Bank supervision is not a suitable tool ofcountercyclical policy.   Nevertheless, the Fed can still lower interest rates. Whenthe Fed supplies more bank reserves, lowering money marketinterest rates, banks will try to lend them out and also willbuy market securities. That is how interest rate reductionswill be diffused over the whole financial system. Doubters ofthe value of monetary stimulus wonder whether anyone willwant to borrow even if interest rates do go lower. Certainlysome of the slowdown in bank lending reflects not the banks'caution but their customers'. Some businesses and householdsare so burdened with past debts and so pessimistic aboutsales and incomes that they will not borrow at any interestrates.   But let's not generalize from the worst cases. Experienceand common sense tell us that more homes will be built andbought if mortgages are available at 7% than at 9%, thatordering materials and hiring workers for expansion will looklike a better deal if the prime rate is 6% instead of 8%,that corporations will be more willing to undertakeinvestment projects, whether for expansion or for costcutting, if corporate bond rates fall a like amount, thatconsumers will find cars and appliances more affordable if acouple of points of interest are chopped off their financecharges. Stock prices rise as interest rates fall, makingboth corporations and stockholders more willing to spend.   The efficacy of monetary policy does not depend solely onthe response of domestic businesses and consumers to cheaperand more available credit. An extremely important butinsufficiently appreciated effect of lower interest rates isto depreciate the dollar, increasing demand for Americanexports and import-competing products. Today, exports --particularly of manufactured products -- could be the drivingforce of a vigorous recovery. But that will take a new doseof depreciation, achieved by putting U.S. interest rates wellbelow those in Europe and Japan.   Some anti-inflation hawks yearn to finish the crusade thatPaul Volcker suspended in 1982. To bring inflation to zero inthe next few years, they would keep the economy slack andstagnant. Would the benefits be worth the costs? The publicclearly favors jobs and prosperity instead. So do PresidentBush and other politicians up for re-election next year.   ---   Mr. Tobin, winner of the 1981 Nobel prize for economics,is professor emeritus at Yale.</TEXT></DOC>
