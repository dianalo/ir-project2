NEC, Fujitsu Ltd. and Hitachi Ltd. ``are looking at the 1990s asthe decade in which they plan to make some serious headway in thesupercomputer commercial marketplace,'' said Jeffrey Canin, a SanFrancisco-based technology analyst.   NEC said Monday the fastest member of its SX-X series attainspeak speeds of more than 20 billion operations per second in onekind of scientific calculation.   The NEC's peak speed is about 25 percent faster than CrayResearch Inc.'s Cray 3, which is due for shipment to customersaround the same time, the July-September period of 1990.   Minneapolis-based Cray is likely to hold its lead insupercomputer sales for several years, partly because hundreds ofprograms are written especially to run on its machines, analystssay.   But in the long run, there is a chance that Japan's excellencein supercomputer hardware could slowly overcome America'sentrenched superiority in software.   ``This new machine is obviously the one to beat,'' said GeorgeLindamood, an analyst at the Gartner Group consulting firm inStamford, Conn. ``I imagine there will be some fairly severegovernment wrangling in Washington as a result of this one.''   Cray stock closed down 12{ cents to $53.87{ a share inconsolidated New York Stock Exchange trading Monday, reflectinginvestors' lack of concern about the short-term effects of the NECannouncement on the company.   Supercomputers are considered crucial to national securitybecause they are heavily used for designing nuclear weapons. Theyalso are used for such tasks as scientific research, oilexploration and weather forecasting.   Japan limited sales of U.S.-made supercomputers in its homemarket in the early and mid-1980s while its own companies developedcompetitive machines.   The U.S. government has strongly discouraged federal agenciesand universities that receive government grants from buyingJapanese-made supercomputers. NEC has only one installed in theUnited States, at the Houston Area Research Consortium.   It is common for supercomputer makers to leapfrog one anotherwith new models, but NEC's forthcoming models are unusuallythreatening in two respects:   _NEC's fastest machine achieves its speed with four processors,while Cray's requires 16. If NEC learns how to hook together moreprocessors it could extend its lead dramatically.   _For the first time, NEC is using a base layer of software thatis already familiar to potential American customers, Unix. Thatcould entice customers who have shied away from NEC until nowbecause of its unfamiliar operating system.   Cray is the world's largest supercomputer maker, althoughInternational Business Machines Corp. leads in the number ofmachines installed when mainframe computers rigged forsupercomputing work are included.   Cray spokesman John Swenson said the company takes all itscompetitors seriously, but added, ``We still seem to offer the mosteffective solution to the user.'' He said peak speed comparisonsare misleading because what counts is how fast a computer will runa particular customer's jobs.   ``Every time the Japanese come out with a new machine peoplestart saying the Japanese are going to eat our lunch. Today westill have about two-thirds of the worldwide market,'' Swenson said.   NEC has one undisputed advantage: It is the world's largestsemiconductor manufacturer that sells on the open market, and canmake its own customized, high-speed logic chips.   Cray relies on Fujitsu for the central logic chips in its CrayY-MP line. The central logic chips for its Cray 3 line will comefrom a small U.S. company, GigaBit Logic Inc. of Newbury Park,Calif.   Possibly the greatest threat to Cray is that American customerswill buy a few Japanese machines because of their sheer speed andthen develop sophisticated software to run on them.   ``If the Japanese software begins to approach the quality ofwhat you can get on a Cray, then the competition begins to get verysevere,'' Lindamood said.   NEC's machines will be sold through HNSX Supercomputers Inc. ofBurlington, Mass., a marketing company jointly owned by NEC andHoneywell Inc. Its president, James Berrett, said the company wouldlike a chance at the government market but failing that will sellto commercial customers, including ``multinationals that are notsingularly concerned with the United States.''   IBM, not Cray, is the company most feared by the Japanesesupercomputer makers. While IBM never has made a puresupercomputer, the world's largest computer company is researchingthe area intensively and is backing Steve Chen, who left Cray lastyear to start a company called Supercomputer Systems Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
