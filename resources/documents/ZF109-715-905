 Results of over 30 years ofAI research and expert systems development are teetering on the edge offailure.andP;  The best we can show from this period are narrowly focused systemswhose results we interpret as intelligent.andP;  Unfortunately, almost as often,the results are stupefying.andM;Item: A local mortgage company ends up with egg on its face when a loan isheld up and the potential homeowner loses out because of changing rates.andP;  Thecause of this lost business is the expert system designed to assist the loanofficer.andP;  According to the system, there is a problem concerning theinformation from the regional credit history depository.andP;  Somewhere along theway, two digits on the buyer's date of birth were mistakenly reversed--from1950 to 1905.andP;  The expert system generates a flag for any 85-year-oldapplicant for a first-time mortgage as well as for anyone with no job historyuntil his or her 66th birthday.andM;Item: A medical diagnosis program is given information about a follow-upvisit recommended by the attending physician a week earlier.andP;  Since this is avisit to record possible changes in the patient's chart, the programdutifully asks for the patient's ocular pressure readings, and then asks forthe patient's birthday and gender this week.andM;Item: An earthquake shatters a glasslined drum containing a virulent compoundat the Oak Ridge National Labs (ORNL).andP;  Fortunately, an expert system is inplace to direct ORNL employees in spill-handling procedures.andP;  Unfortunately,the system was designed just before biological compounds started being storedat the lab, and while programmer teams are currently working to update theprocedures, the newest information is not yet available to the expert system.andO;Nonetheless, during the emergency, the system asks for the name of thecompound, and uses that word throughout its questions and recommendations tothe emergency team responding first to the situation.andP;  These users assume thesystems &quot;knows&quot; what it is doing.andP;  That incorrect, and deadly, assumption isa topic in the national press the following day.andM;Item: Your Advanced Technologies Group places a &quot;scheduling agent&quot; in yourcompany-wide calendar system.andP;  This piece of smart software has been designedto optimize meeting schedules.andP;  Within a week, you find your time is beingfilled up with meetings you would normally have avoided, and worse, yourealize that important meetings with your boss are often delayed by beingsandwiched in between the unending parade of less vital marketing and salesmeetings.andM;Some of these examples are true, others apocryphal.andP;  The point is that weoften need help in getting our jobs done.andP;  We deal with more and moreinformation, conditions change rapidly, and we are enjoined to respond morequickly.andP;  We turn to machines to help us out.andP;  We entrust increasinglycomplex and responsible tasks to our &quot;smart machines,&quot; but these machinesdemonstrate exceptional inability to deal with novel situations.andP;  Mistakesare made that no human would ever make.andP;  These systems are, in a word,brittle.andM;MCC AND THE CYC PROJECT TO THE RESCUE.andP;  In 1983, a consortium was founded.andO;Some of its earlier members included Digital Equipment, CDC, Bellcore, Kodak,NCR, and Harris.andP;  It was called the Microelectronics and Computer TechnologyCorporation (MCC), and its charter was to pursue long-term, high-risk,high-payoff projects.andP;  The fashioning of an entirely new way for machines tounderstand the world so that they could offer genuine assistance was amassive undertaking.andP;  MCC was the perfect place to launch that sort of aproject.andM;At the heart of the project lies a sobering premise that the focus of mostexisting research in artificial intelligence is off-target.andP;  AI's quest forcertainty has, over the last generation, looked for the existence of compact,powerful, and elegant sets of reasoning methods that form the kernel, thefirst principles upon which rests the full spectrum of human thought --logic, humor, creativity, and common sense.andP;  Sadly, such a &quot;Maxwell'sconstant for thought,&quot; such a &quot;cognition reduced instruction set,&quot; probablydoesn't exist.andM;What does exist, and this is the pivotal idea of MCC's CYC (pronounced&quot;psych&quot;) project, is the human reliance on a huge base of factual andconsensually agreed-upon information we typically call common sense.andP;

 Theseare the literally tens of millions of pieces of information we assumeeveryone we have occasion to deal with knows about the world--a universityprofessor, a police officer, a six-year-old child, or even a computerconsultant.andP;  The inelegant solution to the problem of brittleness is that, ifwe ever want machines to do more than perform a caricature of intelligentbehavior, or if we ever want to have them perform useful tasks outsideextremely narrowly defined problem domains, they will have to have afoundation of common sense information.andM;THE HEART OF BRITTLENESS.andP;  Underlying most &quot;smart&quot; systems are rule-basedstructures.andP;  Here's an example of a reasoning system that might be consultedto determine whether one individual should sue another: For the argument,assume your car has been scratched by someone and that there are witnesses tothe event.andP;  A typical (though admittedly trivial) expert system would containa rule like:andM;IF  You property has been damaged by person XandM;AND  there is little uncertainty as to the facts of the caseandM;AND  financial recompense is not of fered voluntarily by person XandM;THEN  sue person X.andM;What happens when person X is a bag lady?andP;  Chances are the suggestedrecommendation is not the best legal advice that can be given.andP;  Systemdesigners can attempt to foresee such a possibility, and could include intheir code an additional qualifying statement &quot;AND person X is not a baglady,&quot; or, if the software developers tend toward the more global solution, astatement like &quot;AND person X is not destitute&quot; might be included.andP;  What aboutif person X is your boss?andP;  What about the case when the damage to property isaccidental?andP;  What if the property involved is immaterial?andP;  What if financialrecompense is a shiny new penny?andP;  No matter how many additional rules youcome up with, the rules-based system fails miserably at dealing with any newtwist of circumstance.andM;One of the factors leading to the brittleness of this kind of rule-basedsystem is that there is no connection between these rules and the real world.andO;There is no understanding of, no falling back on, what anyone should knowabout &quot;property,&quot; or &quot;damage,&quot; or &quot;person,&quot; or any of the concepts that weknow to be important here.andM;CYC attempts to deal with this systemic brittleness.andP;  A CYC-based system thatcould offer considerably better legal advice, for example, is taught thatsuing involves getting money from someone else.andP;  Concepts of money would beput into the system, as would statements about transferring something from Xto Y (when X or Y may or may not be people--with statements about peoplebeing included as well).andP;  The system would be informed of what &quot;everyone&quot;knows about transferring in general, such as: that X and Y must exist ifsomething is to be passed between them; that once X gives up that &quot;something&quot;to Y, X no longer has that thing.andP;  And finally, the CYC system might beinformed about general patterns of lawsuits, precedential material, andcommon anecdotes about who sues who.andM;The payoff in this hypothetical system is an immensely more robust tool thatcan give us consistently better answers to the litigation potential of ourcase, and would, parenthetically, be able to &quot;reason&quot; that a person with 10cents cannot buy an automobile, that homeless people are poor prospects fortorts, and that the world's supply of petrochemicals will eventually run out.andM;WHAT EVERY INTELLIGENT MACHINE OUGHT TO KNOW.andP;  The world according to CYC isorganized as a number of things related to each other.andP;  &quot;Things&quot; can becollections, individuals, or substances, tangible or intangible, dynamic orstatic.andP;  For almost five years, teams of workers have been contributing themillions of bits of consensual knowledge to the CYC database, information toocommon-sensical to be included in any reference books (e.g., &quot;Animals livefor a contiguous time period,&quot; &quot;Nothing can be in two places at once at thesame time,&quot; &quot;Water flows downhill&quot;).andM;In practical terms, the CYC knowledge base engineers select pieces of text.andO;The &quot;things&quot; implied or explicit in the text are added to the CYC database.andO;Finally, a list of questions &quot;anyone ought to be able to answer&quot; (about theselected text) are made up, and the database is queried.andP;  Depending on howthorough and rich the particular area of the CYC knowledge base is, repliesare evaluated for how well they reflect common sense.andP;  One of themisconceptions about the CYC project is that it is the construction of anencyclopedic collection of information.andP;  In many ways, CYC is the complementto an encyclopedia: It is what a reader has to know about the world to makesense of any particular article in an encyclopedia and to be able to answerreasonable questions about what he or she has just read.andM;LOOKING FOR PAYOFFS.andP;  The CYC Knowledge Base project was conceived of as aneffort that would take 8 to 10 years to complete.andP;  Currently at its half-waypoint, the CYC &quot;engine&quot; has found are the literally tens of millions ofpieces of information we assume everyone we have occasion to deal with knowsabout the world--a university professor, a police officer, a six-year-oldchild, or even a computer consultant.andP;

 The CYC Knowledge Base project was conceived of as aneffort that would take 8 to 10 years to complete.andP;  Currently at its halfwaypoint, the CYC &quot;engine&quot; has found its way into a number of exciting anduseful tools.andM;* Intelligent Personal Planner (Digital): The goal of the development effortfor the Intelligent Personal Planner is to come up with a timetable planningaid that understands schedules and meetings (as well as corporatehierarchies).andP;  Here, a meeting with a boss is important enough to reviseexisting meeting plans, and, depending on the significance of the meeting,propose alternate times for other scheduled events.andM;* Semantic Retrieval (Bellcore): A prototype Semantic Retrieval systemperforms an initial scan of information in some designated field of research.andO;It presents, to the human researcher, relationship between concepts thatmight be pursued further.andM;* Full-Text Retrieval (NCR): Current retrieval mechanisms are based on wordmatches that are occasionally supplemented by thesauri techniques.andP;  NCR's&quot;SCAN&quot; software for fulltext retrieval overcomes the limitations of this sortof searching by understanding both the queries and the documents beinganalyzed.andP;  (A doctoral candidate's search through literature on medievalconcepts of &quot;love,&quot; for example, would be spared the volume of clippings fromWimbledon matches.)andM;* Natural Language Understanding (MCC): Interestingly enough, the NaturalLanguage Understanding tool may turn out to be one of earliest and the mostbeneficial by-products of the CYC project.andP;  As the argument goes, you can'tseriously expect to have natural language understanding until you alreadyknow a great deal of consensual reality.andP;  Conventional parsing will fail tounderstand either of the following phrases:andM;&quot;The little girl saw the sled in the window and wanted it.&quot;andM;The &quot;it&quot; is ambiguous.andP;  We know that the little girl wanted thesled--why?--because we know that, for the most part, little girls are drawnmore to sleds than to plate glass.andP;  The phrase below shows how the  meaningof &quot;it&quot; can change in ways that can only be understood by knowing more aboutthe world than about English grammar:andM;&quot;Seeing the sled in the window, the same little girl pressed her foreheadagainst it.&quot;andM;Everyone you or I usually talk to knows that a window is often used toseparate one space from another and acts as a barrier to movement betweenspaces.andP;  In this case, common sense (and the CYC Knowledge Base) leads us toa probable conclusion that a store window sits between the little girl andthe sled, and when she moves in closer to the sled, she presses her foreheadon the pane of plate glass.andM;For the first five years of CYC's life, a small bank of AI researcherslaboriously entered each new bit of information into the system's underlyingrepresentational language.andP;  Almost a year ago, several tools were refinedthat allow a larger cadre of knowledge editors to expand the scope of CYC'scommon sense about the world.andP;  Collaborative and synergistic work with MCC'snatural language understanding group has further broadened the capabilitiesof CYC.andP;  So far, the project is on target and on time.andM;The grand vision of the CYC developers is to have a product that will soon beable to dispense with the manual entry of information about the world.andP;  Atthat time, the role of human intervention in the product will be like that ofa mentor, a person suggesting further studies or explaining the moredifficult concepts.andP;  By the middle of this decade, developers hope CYC willhave become a system that can learn by discovery and that can reason byanalogy and generalization.andP;  When that happens, our machines will no longerbe electronic equivalents of typewriters, calculators, and filing cabinets.andO;Our machines, finally, will have evolved into helpful assistants.andP;  It won'tbe a moment too soon.andM;Tom Portante is the Director of Randamp;D at Patricia Seybold's Office ComputingGroup.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
