(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Larger LANs demand different management tools-not just more powerful, butdifferent.andP;  Nowhere is this clearer than in backup.andM;Backup is more than just writing files to tapes, it's data management and itmust be based on strategic decisions.andP;  This is true even for smaller LANs.andO;However, with smaller LANs, the decisions may be so easy that they go byalmost unnoticed.andP;  (This, in fact, can be a problem when small LANs grow upto be big LANs and strategic decisions have been made that didn't take thatgrowth into account.)andM;These strategic decisions include:andM;* What is the &quot;horizon&quot; for preserving files? Do they need to be preservedfor a month? A year? Forever?andM;* What will the backup schedule be?andM;* How will tapes be rotated? For example, the manager may do an incrementalbackup each day and one full backup at the end of each week.andM;* What system of labelling, storing, and keeping track of tapes is needed?andO;And how Will you determine which versions of which files are on which tapes?andM;*  What should the manager be responsible for? Many managers are saddled withthe thankless job of grooming&quot; the file server, migrating unneeded files totape and deleting them from the server.andP;  Preventing viruses from being backedup to tape may be part of the job as well.andM;On smaller LANs, the backup software may handle only a part of overall datamanagement.andP;  The administrator does the rest manually or with separateprograms.andP;  This manual approach works because the systems demands are light.andO;A simple tape rotation scheme may work fine.andP;  Only a moderate number tapes isrequired, so keeping track of them is easy.andM;The number of users is small, so the network manager knows how each userstores his or her data.andP;  That makes it possible to restore a file, even ifthe user has forgotten pertinent information such as the name of the file ordirectory.andP;  Grooming the file server is easy, because the manager can dealwith each user's files, based on knowledge of the user's applications andhabits.andM;At some point, the data management task becomes too complex to handlemanually.andP;  As applications become larger and more critical to the company,the horizon for data preservation stretches out, perhaps to several years orbeyond.andP;  This requires complex tape rotation schemes, large numbers of tapes,and both off- and on-site storage.andP;  With many users, the manager can'tpossibly know how they organize their files or which files they do not need.andO;As more users have acceSS to the system, and as links to the outside worldincrease, viruses are more likely.andP;  In short, the data management task islarger, the margin for error is smaller.andM;The Network Archivist (TNA) was designed for these LANs.andP;  It makes strategicdecisions for you, working under fairly stringent assumptions (infinitehorizon, huge amounts of data, off-site storage required, many users, and soforth) and then automates the resulting system to the point where backuptakes a single keystroke.andM;Actually, most managers of smaller LANs would probably love to have TNA too,if not for the cost: $1,295 just for the software.andP;  However, when essentialbackup is ignored because it is &quot;too much of a hassle,&quot; it may be worthwhileto invest in TNA even for smaller LANs.andP;  TNA's backup is so easy that LANmanagers may be less inclined to avoid the job.andM;InstallationandM;I installed the TNA hardware and software in approximately 15 minutes,without reading the instructions and with only one slight glitch.andP;  I have toadmit that I installed an earlier version of TNA a year or so before this,but I really don't think I remembered many details of the previousinstallation.andM;The main hardware components were a half card controller and the 2.2GB tapedrive.andP;  A third minor component was a cable to connect the two.andP;  I installedthe controller in an AT-bus workstation on my 4M-bits-per-second IBMToken-Ring network running SFT NetWare 2.15.andP;  The card had no jumpers or DIPswitches to set.andP;  I just stuck the controller in the slot.andP;  The tape drive,an external box, had a separate power cord.andP;  Plugging the tape drive in andattaching the cable to the controller card and the tape drive completed thehardware installation.andM;The TNA software came on a single 5-1/4&quot; high-density floppy disk thatcontained 12 files totalling a little over 1MB of data.andP;  Softwareinstallation meant putting the floppy in drive A: and typing INSTALL.andP;  Thencame the one minor glitch.andP;  The TNA install program aborts if you do not havea CONFIG.SYS file on your boot drive with a FILES = 20 command in it.andP;  (Anynumber from 20 to the maximum allowed by your version of DOS is okay, too.) Ididn't have a CONFIG.SYS on my boot drive, so I had to create one and thenreboot before running INSTALL again.andM;The INSTALL program asks two questions.andP;  First, it asks where to install thesoftware.andP;  (I chose drive F:, my network drive).andP;  Second, it asks you to namethe tape collection to be created by this copy of TNA.andP;  You make up anarbitrary name of three to six characters.andP;  If other copies of TNA exist inthe company, each name should be unique.andP;  Later, when you start creatingtapes, TNA's labelling system will use this name as a base.andP;  For instance, Iselected MTIG (for MTI Group).andP;  My tape labels were MTIG-A1, MTIGA2, MTIG-B1,MTIG-B2, and so on.andM;The INSTALL program automatically created a TNA directory on my F: drive,copied its files into the directory and created some catalog files, which TNAuses to keep track of tapes and backed up files.andP;  Finally, it instructed meto insert a line in the supervisor's login script, MAP INSERTSEARCH15:=SYS:_TNA.andP;  s makes it possible to run TNA from any directory.andM;Backing UpandM;Now I was ready to use TNA.andP;  I typed &quot;TNA&quot; at the DOS prompt.andP;  The TNA mainmenu popped up with impressive speed, giving me six choices: Fl for Help, F2for Tape Schedule and Status, F3 for Restore an Entire Disk Drive, F4 forPerform Automatic Archiving to Tape, F10 for Quit, and ENTER for All OtherArchive Operations.andP;  F4 was the obvious choice.andM;When I pressed F4, TNA told me that the tape drive was not responding to itscommands.andP;  It listed several possible reasons for this, including that thetape drive might not be turned on.andP;  I checked, and, yes, I had neglected toturn the tape drive on.andP;  This was the first of many indications that TNA wasmore intelligent than I was.andM;I turned the drive on and asked TNA to try again.andP;  TNA opened the tape drivedoor and asked me to insert a blank tape, which I did.andP;  From then on, TNAtook over and backed up my entire F: drive.andP;  Except for the detour to turnthe tape drive on, all I did was press F4.andM;TNA kept me well-informed throughout the process.andP;  It told me how many filesand megabytes had been scheduled for backup.andP;  It displayed the time thebackup should take and how much time remained.andP;  The number of files andmegabytes remaining were displayed.andP;  TNA also told me what the tape statuswas, such as opening, writing files, or rewinding.andP;  Finally, TNA providedinformation about which portion of the backup process it was working on.andO;Some of these messages were intuitively clear, such as &quot;Scancheckpoints.&quot;andO;Either way, I was strictly a spectator.andP;  After a while, I got bored and reada book.andM;It took 73 minutes to back up one drive, with about 150MB of data on it.andO;Later backups, by the way, went more quickly, because TNA intelligently stopsbacking up files for which you already have three copies.andP;  (You can set thisnumber higher or lower if you want, but three seems to suit most people'sneeds.)andM;I noticed that a large part of the time, perhaps a third of it, TNA did notuse the tape drive.andP;  It either scanned files on the disk or did housekeeping.andO;TNA's housekeeping is fairly extensive, since it implements a sophisticatedsystem for rotating tapes, grooming the file server, and so on.andM;Eventually, TNA opened the tape drive door and told me to remove the tape andlabel it MTIG-A1.andP;  My first backup session was over.andP;  It was easy to thepoint of boredom.andP;  But, then, who wants exciting backup?andM;RetrievingandM;My next step was to retrieve a file.andP;  I got out of TNA, deleted a file on thedisk, and got back into TNA.andP;  Since I only wanted to retrieve one file, noneof the choices on the main menu was appropriate.andP;  I pressed ENTER to get tothe other operations.andP;  A screen similar to that in Figure 1 (p.andP;  134)appeared.andP;  (The Archive and MAILING.DBF windows weren't there, though.) Asyou can see along the bottom, this screen gave me six choices: Select,Archive, Display, File, Utility, and Quit.andP;  After futzing around, Idiscovered that retrieving a file is a two-step process:andM;*  First, you tag the file by cursor keying down the list on the right andpressing the plus key when you get to the desired file.andP;  TNA puts ahighlighted plus sign to the left of the file name to let you know you'veselected it.andM;* Second, press  A&quot; to bring up the Archive menu (Alt-A also works).andP;  Now,the Archive menu, as shown in Figure 2, pops up.andP;  Select Retrieve file(s).andO;TNA asks you to confirm the retrieval you've set up, and then you're off.andO;TNA retrieved my file without any problem, though the process took about fiveminutes for a 31 byte file.andP;  Most of that time was spent manipulating thetape: opening it, finding the file, and rewinding.andM;Guard DutyandM;The software includes a 25KB TSR, called TNAWATCH, mainly for unattendedbackup.andP;  You set the day and time and if TNAWATCH is loaded, it performs thebackup at the indicated time.andM;TNAWATCH also has a function relating to grooming the file server.andP;  Whenfiles are migrated (written to tape and deleted from the disk), TNA can beconfigured to create &quot;phantom&quot; files that have the same names as the deletedfiles but no contents (and zero length).andP;  If someone tries to open one ofthese files, TNAWATCH displays a message on the screen saying that the filehas been migrated to tape and the user should contact the network manager.andO;Finally, TNAWATCH guards against viruses  by watching  for changes toexecutable files.andM;I only tested the unattended archiving capability of TNAWATCH, and then onlyfar enough to make sure that it started archiving at approximately the righttime.andP;  It did.andP;  TNAWATCH seemed well behaved in my environment, notinterfering with my word processor (WordPerfect 4.2) or my database manager(Advanced Revelation 1.1).andP;  Palindrome has some interesting plans forTNAWATCH.andP;  (See sidebar, The Phantom Demigrator.)andM;Lots MoreandM;TNA is easy to use.andP;  However, it does have a number of trickier functionsthat take a bit of learning.andP;  One of these is the rules capability, whichallows you to configure when files will be checkpointed, saved, and migrated.andO;These three terms require a little explanation.andM;Checkpointing refers to taking a snapshot&quot; of a recently changed file.andP;  Theassumption is that the file will continue to change and you don't need apermanent copy of every version that ever existed.andP;  For a word processingfile, for example, TNA might easily copy 20 versions of the file to tapeduring a month.andP;  If five of those copies are still around at the end of themonth, though, that's probably plenty.andM;Saving means making a permanent copy of the file, one that will never beoverwritten.andP;  TNA saves a few early copies of each file, so that your horizonfor recovering files is infinite.andP;  Once three copies of the same version ofthe same file have been made, the file is considered protected and will onlybe checkpointed if it changes again.andP;  (As mentioned, you can configure therequired number of copies, if three doesn't suit you.)andM;The files that TNA suggests for migration are the least recently accessedfiles.andP;  it is the access date, not the modification date, that counts;obviously, you don't want to migrate files that are read constantly, even ifthey aren't changed.andP;  Files that are not accessed for a long time are notlikely to be missed.andP;  There is little danger to migration, since TNA will notsuggest migrating a file until it is fully protected, with several permanentsaves on tape.andP;  (The user can set the number of saves.)andM;The rules capability allows you to determine the circumstances under whichfiles will be checkpointed, saved, and migrated.andP;  For instance, the defaultfor most files is to checkpoint whenever the file is changed, save after sixweeks and migrate after 12 weeks.andP;  Some files, however, are by default nevermigrated.andP;  This is the case with NET$OS.EXE.andP;  The choices for checkpointing,saving, and migrating are &quot;On change,&quot; &quot;On demand,&quot;  Always,&quot; &quot;Never  ...andP;  ..andO;After stability,&quot; and &quot;Every period.&quot; (&quot;Stability&quot; means that the file hasn'tchanged in a given time, user-definable from one hour to 9,999 weeks.andP;  A&quot;period&quot; is just a userdefined period of time, from one hour to 9,999 weeks.)andM;You can also configure TNA to migrate files to tape automatically.andP;  I didn'ttry that.andP;  I like to confirm each and every deletion myself.andM;I used TNA to migrate files to tape manually, an extremely useful functionfor managers who are fighting for disk space.andP;  This function allowed me totag all files in all directories on the server that matched a pattern andthen migrate them to tape.andP;  I selected the pattern* .bk!, the pattern forWordPerfect backup files.andP;  I stopped using the WordPerfect backup featuresome time ago, so there weren't a lot of *.bk! files left.andP;  But TNA found thefew that were still out there, and I gained a few kilobytes of disk space.andO;On a file server where a number of users have taken advantage of thisWordPerfect feature, untold megabytes might be freed up in this fashion.andM;DocumentationandM;The program never misbehaved during testing.andP;  I did have some problems withdocumentation though.andP;  For instance, when I decided to protect the local harddisk, I couldn't find the necessary information in the manual.andP;  Nothing inthe table of contents looked promising.andP;  In the index, I looked under &quot;Disk&quot; and &quot;Protect  Protect&quot; wasn't even in the index and &quot;Disk&quot; didn't haveanything about protecting disks.andP;  When I found the information (under &quot;DriveLetter, Utility/Configure TNA&quot;), the manual and the program did not match.andO;The protect function was on a different menu from the one the manualindicated.andP;  I reviewed v. 1.6 of TNA, and one of the enhancements of v. 2.0is new documentation.andP;  Hopefully-this problem will be solved with the newversion.andP;  Other than that the thing that bugged me the most was that severalof TNA's message screens had misspellings or typos.andP;  On one screen, &quot;cabling&quot;was misspelled.andP;  On another, qualify&quot; is consistently misspelled &quot;pualify.&quot;andM;If you think I'm picking nits, I agree with you.andP;  But these were the level ofproblems I had with TNA.andM;Under the CoversandM;Another important part of the TNA story is what the software does in thebackground.andP;  Consider for example, the tape rotation scheme, named &quot;Tower ofHanoi&quot; after a child's puzzle.andP;  (See sidebar, Tower of Hanoi.)andM;The Tower of Hanoi rotation scheme uses a mathematical algorithm for rotatingtapes, which insures that some tapes are used frequently, others lessfrequently, and others seldom.andP;  A Tower of Hanoi sequence with five tapeswould look like this:andM;ABAC ABAD ABAC ABAEandM;Tape A is used eight times, tape B four times, tape C twice, and tapes E andD once.andP;  This means that information on tapes D and E could only beoverwritten every 16 backup sessions, and information on tape C only onceevery eight sessions, even though you've only got five tapes.andP;  At the sametime, information on tape A is refreshed every other backup session, andinformation on tape B every fourth backup session, so that these two tapesalways contain relatively new files.andP;  The Tower of Hanoi provides amathematically optimal compromise between two conflicting goals: a longhorizon for recovering files and lots of recent copies of rapidly changingfiles.andM;Even the Tower of Hanoi scheme doesn't save files permanently.andP;  Eventually,and far too soon for most people's taste, everything will be overwritten.andO;For this reason, TNA refrains from overwriting some of the oldest versions ofeach file.andP;  These permanent saves are written to the same tapes as thecheckpoint files that may be overwritten.andP;  As mentioned, when the sameversion of a file has been saved three times (or whatever number you choose),it is no longer backed up, saving time and tape.andM;The file-by-file tracking of changes and stability, checkpoints, and saves,combined with the Tower of Hanoi tape rotation could be tremendously complexand time-consuming.andP;  TNA does it all when you press one button.andM;Backup is not just backup.andP;  It involves a number of strategic decisions.andP;  If,in making those decisions, you set your sites high (infinite horizon,frequent checkpointing, file server grooming, efficient use of tapes), youare presented with a data management task of significant proportions.andP;  TNAimplements a well-thought out automated approach to this task that is beyondwhat the average LAN manager would be able to pull off using backup softwarethat only does backup.andM;PALINDROMEandM;The Network ArchivistandM;PalindromeandM;710 E.

How about a phantom demigrator basedon TNAWATCH? Files could be migrated not only to tape but to slower storagemedia such as optical disks.andP;  Phantom files with zero length would be left inplace of the migrated files.andP;  When a user tries to access a phantom file,TNAWATCH automatically de-migrates the file back onto the faster storagemedium.andP;  A whole hierarchy of storage devices could be set up, from fastestdown to slowest: parallel hard disks, ordinary hard disks, optical disks,juke boxes of optical disk, and tapes.andP;  At each level, TNA monitors file useto determine which files to migrate or demigrate.andM;Tower of HanoiandM;The Tower of Hanoi tape rotation strategy is based on the children's game of,the same name.andP;  There are three poles and five rings.andP;  At the start of thegame, the left pole has a stack of five progressively larger rings, thelargest ring on the bottom.andP;  To win the game, move one ring at a time andreassemble the tower onto the right pole.andP;  One last rule: You can never put alarger ring on top of a smaller one.andM;The solution is to move the rings in a sequence such as the following,assuming that E is the top (smallest) ring:andM;EDEC EDEB EDEC EDEA EDEC EDEB EDEC EDE incidentally, this sequence forms aPalindrome; that is, it reads the same backwards as forwards.andM;Note that this is not the complete solution.andP;  You still need to figure outwhich pole to move each ring to.andP;  I'll leave that to you.andM;Jim GastandM;Vice PresidentandM;Product ManagementandM;Palindrome Corp.andM;Michael Hurwicz, founder of the MTI Group of East Sound, Wash., is a writerand consultant specializing in LANs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
