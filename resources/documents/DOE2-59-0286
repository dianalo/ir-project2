<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-59-0286 </DOCNO><TEXT>We develop a stability theory for abstract Hamiltonian systems arisingfrom many models in classical field theories: Their solitary wave solutionsare characterized by minimization principles (ground states) and theirenergy functional has the so-called scale-covariance property. In additionthe systems may be invariant under one-parameter groups of isometricoperators. In addition the systems may be invariant under one-parametergroups of isometric operators. We present sharp stability conditionsfor ground state solitary waves. Our theory applies to a large seriesof examples. In particular we are able to give a more general study ofthe stability properties of solitary waves of nonlinear Klein-Gordonequations and nonlinear Schroedinger equations.</TEXT></DOC>
