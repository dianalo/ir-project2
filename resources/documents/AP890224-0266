After the close on Thursday, Chase Manhattan Bank of New Yorkkicked off the second round of prime rate increases this month,raising the benchmark rate on variable loans from 11 percent to 11.5percent.   As more banks joined in that move today, the Federal Reserveincreased its discount rate, the charge it sets on loans to privatefinancial institutions, from 6.5 percent to 7 percent. The Fed saidit acted in response to ``inflationary pressures in the economy.''   Open-market interest rates on securities such as bonds andTreasury bills also climbed today.   The rise in rates did not come as a complete surprise, givenrecent government reports suggesting that inflation was heating up.   Nevertheless, it increased investors' worries about the businessand economic outlook, analysts said.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
