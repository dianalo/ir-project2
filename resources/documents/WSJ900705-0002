Because McClane already had overcome enormous obstaclesin the original &quot;Die Hard,&quot; I immediately suspected(correctly, as it turned out) that he would get his car backin the end, though there would be much mayhem in between.   Yet somehow the inevitability that hovered over this filmfrom the start didn't spoil its pleasures. This is the movieequivalent of a junk-food binge. It may not be good for you,but sometimes nothing can taste better than just the rightmixture of grease, salt, sugar and crunch.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; has its own surefire queasiness-inducer:international terrorism played out at a major Americanairport during the Christmas rush, and it is snowing. Onesuspects that screenwriters Steven E. de Souza and DougRichardson are frequent fliers, because throughout the filmthey have astutely milked every real and imagined nightmarean airplane passenger could have. Among other things, theyand director Renny Harlin have staged a brutally ingeniousdogfight in the baggage area, using luggage as both shieldand weapon.   As a frequent flier myself I always have had a perversefondness for even the worst airport-disaster movies. None hasworked the genre better than this tautly constructed piece ofwork.   Once again Bruce Willis plays McClane with his usualcombination of swagger and gravity and the rueful smirk thathas made him a star. Dropping self-mocking wisecracks as hesprings from heroic act to heroic act, Mr. Willis's McClaneis a blue-collar American James Bond.   Unlike the Bond films, however, which were a creation ofthe '60s, the &quot;Die Hard&quot; pictures have an anti-technologicalbent, though they are models of technological wizardry. (&quot;DieHard 2&quot; contains some startling special effects.) In theoriginal, McClane almost singlehandedly thwarts a team ofvicious thieves in a brawl that destroys a modern skyscraperin an explosion of glass and humanity.   This time, he alone figures out the monstrous labyrinthconcealed behind the public areas of a vast airport, as heworks to head off a band of terrorists who have deftlyundermined the air traffic control system. And the filmmakers make sly use of trendy techno-gear like faxes andairplane telephones both as plot devices and as the subjectof my favorite line in the film, which won't be revealedhere. And in this sequel, they once again up the ante byplacing the hero's wife (Bonnie Bedelia) in peril.   Mr. Harlin is the young Finnish director who made his markhere with &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,&quot; themost commercially successful of the &quot;Elm Street&quot; films. Hereagain he shows that he knows how to improve on an original,that he's an aces sequel maker (John McTiernan directed thefirst &quot;Die Hard&quot;).   There's no place for nuance in this kind of movie and Mr.Harlin hasn't included any. Dennis Franz plays the witlessairport police chief with an air of unrelenting myopia.Journalists, as in &quot;Die Hard,&quot; are brainless careerists,though one female reporter is permitted a brief show ofhumanity. The villains are double-dyed monsters.   Mr. Harlin's fundamental gift is knowing how to induce thekind of controlled panic that kicks in on action-park rides.You can giggle at the terror because you can see the man atthe switch, setting the same ride in motion over and overagain. Silly as it is, you'll probably go around yet again,if the opportunity arises, and you expect that it will.   ---   &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; tells the story of a stock-car driverwho loses his will to race after an accident but recovers itand also wins the heart of a beautiful Australian doctor whoconveniently practices medicine near the DaytonaInternational Race way.   This didn't turn out to be the bad movie I thought itwould be when early on one character says to another: &quot;If youbuild the car I'll find a driver.&quot; That bad movie would havebeen corny, but it would have had some excitement when thehero won, then failed, then won again having gained maturityalong the way.   The movie that director Tony Scott (&quot;Top Gun,&quot; &quot;BeverlyHills Cop II&quot;) came up with avoided the usual manipulationfound in this kind of proving-his-manhood kind of movie.Falling back on his roots in advertising, Mr. Scott hassmoothed over the racetrack world with an airbrush. There ismuch talk about the dangers and drama of race-car driving,but little of it actually appears on screen.   The movie blurs into a continuum of cars pounding oneanother and closeups of faces showing disgust, happiness,fear and outrage. It's the kind of shorthand imagery thatworks best in brief spurts, say, the amount of time it takesfor a television commercial to implant a spark-plug brandinto your brain.   Dragged out for two hours the imagery becomes boring, andthere is nothing that even skilled actors like Robert Duvalland Tom Cruise can do to help. Mr. Cruise, who supposedly gotthe idea for this movie after driving a race car, wasphotographed to look like a soft pretty boy. Millions ofteen-aged girls probably will not be disappointed.   ---   VIDEO TIP: &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; gave me the urge to look atsome Steve McQueen movies. The late Mr. McQueen raced carsfor fun in life and played men who liked to drive cars asthough they were racing in the movies. The chase sequence inthe detective story &quot;Bullitt&quot; remains nerve-racking, and sodoes the chase in &quot;The Getaway.&quot; It was a motorcycle in &quot;TheGreat Escape&quot; that pushed McQueen into stardom. But McQueenwas his own best engine; take a look at &quot;The Cincinnati Kid,&quot;&quot;Junior Bonner&quot; -- and my favorite, &quot;The Thomas CrownAffair.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
