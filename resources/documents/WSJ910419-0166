In the year-ago quarter, Engelhard had net of $14.8million, or 33 cents a share, on revenue of $658.5 million.</LP><TEXT>   Orin R. Smith, president and chief executive officer, saidEngelhard was able to achieve the gains despite the weakenedeconomy because of the company's position as the No. 1supplier in its significant markets, mainly in its catalystsand pigments businesses. &quot;When you put cost reduction on topof that, you've got some nice performance in a difficultmarket,&quot; he added.   A restructuring that entailed a work force reduction andthe sale of some businesses resulted in $30 million ofreduced costs on an annualized basis.   The largest profit gains came from petroleum andenvironmental catalysts, pigments for non-paper uses andprecious metals management, Mr. Smith said. In addition tobeing in the chemicals and catalysts, and pigments andadditives businesses, Engelhard also has an engineeredmaterials and precious metals management business, which isthe largest in terms of revenue because of the preciousmetals raw materials used in producing the products.   Although Mr. Smith said the company doesn't forecastearnings, he said the majority of analysts' earningsestimates fall in the range of $1.90 and $2 a share for theyear, which he termed &quot;reasonable.&quot; In 1990, the companyearned $70.3 million, or $1.57 a share, on revenue of $2.94billion.   &quot;We are the largest supplier of catalysts in the world,&quot;Mr. Smith said. &quot;The goal is to become the dominant supplierover the next few years.&quot; Catalysts change a reaction butaren't consumed in the reaction; for example, petroleumrefiners use catalysts to produce gasoline.   Engelhard is focusing on the environmental catalystsegment, the area that is expected to grow fastest. &quot;If youcan solve a problem catalytically, it generally is the mostcost-effective&quot; solution, he said. Mr. Smith sees the marketfor environmental catalysts growing at a compounded rate ofmore than 20% over the next five to 10 years.   Although the company has been developing environmentalcatalysts to treat toxic emissions from automobiles andairplanes, it is increasingly focusing on catalysts to treattoxic emissions from sources such as cogeneration plants andpower stations. Engelhard also is working to developtechnology to prevent toxic emissions from being createdwithin an industrial process, as opposed to treating theemissions after they are formed.   Consequently, most of the $45 million Engelhard plans tospend on research and development this year -- about the sameas a year ago -- is focused on environmental catalysts.   Engelhard, which is 30%-owned by Minorco, a Europeanholding company, expects to sell its North American gold andsilver fabrication businesses, with expected revenue ofbetween $125 million and $150 million this year. But Mr.Smith doesn't expect a sale to have an impact on earnings.   Mr. Smith said he expects double-digit growth in revenueover the next few years, and he expects return on equity,which was 10% last year, to &quot;be further up in the doubledigits&quot; this year, to between 12% and 13%.</TEXT></DOC>
