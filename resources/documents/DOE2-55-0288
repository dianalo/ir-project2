The findings are discussed in lightof our earlier studies with NO{sub 2} exposure alone. In all of thesestudies the mouse B16 melanoma model was used. Animals were exposed toambient concentrations of pollutants before melanoma-cell infusion. Theresults have indicated that inhalation of NO{sub 2} played a significantrole in facilitation of blood-borne cancer cell spread, while O{sub 3}inhalation did not. With respect to mechanisms involved, the role ofnatural immunity was investigated and its was postulated that nitrogendioxide may affect cells of the immune system and may in part accountfor the results. These findings may have direct bearing on disseminationof human cancer cells, since many cancer patients have circulating cancercells and are exposed daily to noxious air pollutants. Most importantly,this effect may be preventable by reducing air pollution in urban areas.</TEXT></DOC>
