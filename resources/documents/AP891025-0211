Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., and Eni F.H. Faleomavaega, AmericanSamoa's non-voting delegate to Congress, also urged consumers notto purchase tuna from nations whose canneries process fish suppliedby the drift-net fleets.   DeFazio said it was his understanding that virtually all of thecanned tuna imported from Southeast Asia contained fish caught bythe drift-net fleets of Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, and thatThailand was the ``principal processor'' of such fish.   All imported tuna is required to bear the country of origin onits label, although DeFazio said such labeling was often in fineprint.   ``The United States is the only major market for canned tuna,importing almost $250 million of drift-net-caught tuna just lastyear,'' DeFazio said. ``I think American consumers would be willingto pay a few cents more for a can of tuna in order to force thesenations to stop using drift nets.   ``I have yet to meet an American family that thinks it is a goodidea to strangle dolphins and other animals in drift nets.''   DeFazio said about 30 percent of the canned tuna sold in theUnited States is imported.   ``The American market has enormous economic clout and can forcea change in these fishing technologies,'' said Gerry Leape,Greenpeace's legislative director for ocean ecology issues.   A Greenpeace spokeswoman, however, said later in the day theenvironmental group was not actually calling for a boycott.   ``We are not opposed to a boycott, but would prefer that thingsbe done legislatively,'' said Blair Palese. ``Boycotts are not theanswer, there are better ways to do things. We tell people if theywant to avoid buying tuna, that's fine. But it is hard forconsumers to understand what tuna to buy or not to buy.''   Last week, DeFazio introduced legislation that could lead to aU.S. ban on fish imports from nations known to use drift nets or toprocess drift-net catches.   ``We need to hit them in their pocketbooks,'' DeFazio told anews conference, adding that drift-net fleets were ``effectivelystrip-mining'' the Pacific Ocean of both tuna and salmon.   DeFazio said the small-mesh, monofilament nets also killthousands of marine mammals, sea birds and other marine animalsannually.   ``Every night these nations drop 30,000 miles of net _ a virtualwall of death that could encircle the entire globe,'' DeFazio said.``If this continues for a few more years, we will have a beautiful,shimmering biological desert off the West Coast.''   The Bush administration has agreed to support a temporarymoratorium on drift-net fishing on the South Pacific, but has beenreluctant to seek a similar ban in either the North Pacific orinternationally.   The administration earlier this summer reached separateenforcement and monitoring agreements with Taiwan, Korea and Japanthat State Department officials hope will supply adequatescientific data for the administration to decide whether to seek aninternational ban.   DeFazio said further studies were not needed and ``we do nothave time for lengthy negotiations.''</TEXT></DOC>
