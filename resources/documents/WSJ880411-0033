First Federal, the fourth Oklahoma savings institution closed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board this year, had $128.8 million in assets and $161.5 million in liabilities. Globe is a federally chartered stock association with $180 million in assets.    Federal regulators attributed First Federal's insolvency in part to its former management, which in 1983 began aggressively investing in portions of major commercial real estate loans that had severe underwriting deficiencies.    Much of the investment was done through Savings Investment Service Corp., of which First Federal was a stockholder and First Federal's former president was a director. The closed thrift is a defendant in extensive litigation concerning Savings Investment Service and other matters. According to regulators, several other Oklahoma thrifts have failed as a result of purchasing loans from the corporation.    The transaction brings to 18 the number of troubled thrifts the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has closed or merged this year, compared with 48 in all of 1987. </TEXT></DOC>
