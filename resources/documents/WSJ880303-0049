A Banque National de Belgique spokesman said the move is in line with recent declines in market interest rates but also reflects the current strength of the Belgian franc on foreign exchange markets.    The discount rate is the lending fee charged by the central bank to financial institutions. The Lombard is a rate under which banks borrow from the central bank using certain securities as collateral. The Lombard is generally used only for last-resort financing. The central bank last cut these rates Jan. 28, also by a quarter of a percentage point.    The three-month money market rate, the most important rate on the Belgian market, already has been cut five times this year. </TEXT></DOC>
