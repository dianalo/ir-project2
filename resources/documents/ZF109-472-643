(letter to the editor)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Stevens, Bob; Smith, David; Simmons, Kendall; Kliman, Dave; Tubbs,Steve; Wright, Kevin.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Alternative resource for global warming stackandM;You recently ran a story about Earthquest, our new program about the earthand environment.andP;  Included in this story was mention of the global warmingstack developed by Apple volunteers.andP;  You mention that a global warming stackis available through EcoNet.andP;  Your readers may be interested to know thatwhen you purchase Earthquest, the global warming stack is included free ofcharge.andM;Bob Stevens and David SmithandM;co-founders, Earthquest Inc.andM;Palo Alto, Calif.andM;'God's computer' towers above DOS platformandM;I am writing this letter to commend you on your excellent publication.andP;  Wehave become dependent upon the information you publish.andM;This letter is written on one of those dinosaur DOS machines: no WYSIWYG, nofonts displayed on-screen, no underlines shown and no bolds shown courtesy ofWordPerfect 5.1.andP;  I enjoy my work, but I cannot tolerate using these machineswhen &quot;God's computer&quot; (that's how Tom Clancy refers to his Macintosh) wouldlead to a substantial increase in productivity.andM;For this reason, I am in the process of starting my own company with my ownchoice of computers.andP;  The ProductWatch section and other articles have becomevital to our equipment decisions.andP;  All the information has been useful, eventhe subtle addresses and phone numbers of companies at the end of eacharticle.andP;  I most enjoyed the MacWEEK ad comparing different Macintoshpublications, in which a yellow PostIt-style note was shown with an order forsome equipment found in an advertisement from a MacWEEK.andP;  That is exactly howwe have made decisions ourselves.andM;I realize that everyone needs a vacation, but the weeks when MacWEEK is notpublished really seem empty at the office.andP;  Keep up the great work.andP;  I wish Ihad some rumors for Mac the Knife so I could get a mug, but I'm afraid I'llnever have a rumor.andP;  I rely on MacWEEK for my info.andP;  Are the mugs for sale?andM;Kendall SimmonsandM;Annapolis, Md.andM;After the flack we took from one reader for that ad campaign (see MacWEEK,Aug.andP;  7) it's refreshing to hear from someone who thinks as we do.andP;  As forthe mugs: Alas, even thoughtful flattery such as yours is not enough.andP;  Ourlong-standing company policy is to take only tips.andP;  -- Ed.andM;What if shrinking drive options applied to SIMMs?andM;This is in response to Thomas Seibold's letter (MacWEEK, Sept.andP;  11).andM;We sell SIMMs (single in-line memory modules).andP;  Many of our Apple-dealercustomers cannot buy too many from us any more because they are required topurchase their memory from Apple.andP;  Even though the Apple memory comes fromthe same manufacturers as our memory, dealers have to pay two to three timesas much per megabyte because Apple now offers only Macintosh IIs with 4 or 8Mbytes of memory already installed.andP;  Who pays the premium for Apple-installedmemory?andP;  The end users, I'll bet!andM;What can be done about this monopoly?andP;  I don't know.andP;  Maybe soon Apple willoffer only configurations with hard drives.andP;  Then Thomas' $500 savings willbe down the tubes, won't it?andM;Dave Kliman, presidentandM;TurbotechandM;New Hyde Park, N.Y.andM;No doubt Apple is constantly casting about for methods to maintain its veryhigh profit margins.andP;  This is one alternative we hope it will neverimplement.andP;  -- Ed.andM;INIThound: PurebredStartup document trackerandM;Your article in the Aug.andP;  7 issue about Baseline Publishing Inc.'s INITManager product says that &quot;INIT Manager's most distinguishing feature is itstechnical reporting, a capability available in several shareware utilitiesbut not in any of the current commercial entrants in the field.&quot;andM;INIThound, Cambridge Information Ware's Startup document (INIT)-trackingutility, has contained extensive technical-reporting capabilities since itscommercial release in August 1989.andP;  INIThound was even mentioned in the Aug.andO;22, 1989, issue and again in the Oct.andP;  31, 1989, issue.andM;Steve TubbsandM;Cambridge Information WareandM;Cambridge, Mass.andM;Thanks for pointing out the error in our reporting.andP;  -- Ed.andM;Mars 800 developer backhands scanner storyandM;After reviewing your article titled &quot;Hand scanners go head-to-head,&quot;(MacWEEK, Aug.andP;  21) we feel that a few items should be clarified.andP;  You listedin &quot;Hand-held scanner features&quot; that the Mars 800 could scan only at 100-dpithrough 400-dpi resolution and that the Half-Page Scanner/400 from TheComplete P.C.andP;  Inc. could in fact scan at up to 800-dpi resolution.andP;  Quitethe converse is true.andP;  The Mars 800 is the only hand-held scanner that isable to scan images at up to 800-dpi resolution.andM;Also overlooked was the fact that the Mars 800 dither patterns are defined byan 8-by-8-pixel matrix, unlike the other hand scanners reviewed; theirdithered patterns are defined by only a 6-by-6-pixel matrix.andM;MacWEEK also failed to mention that the other products were in the prototypestage and not yet available for resale.andP;  Silicon Beach Software had not yetcompleted the pouch enabling users to scan directly while in DigitalDarkroom, thus eliminating switching between Scankit and Digital Darkroom andmaking available Digital Darkroom's many editing tools.andM;We feel that the above issues are of critical importance and should bebrought to the attention of MacWEEK and its readers.andM;Kevin WrightandM;marketing managerandM;Marstek Inc., Irvine, Calif.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
