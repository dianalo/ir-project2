White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the planes, made by Northrop Corp., will come from existing U.S. Air Force inventories and cost $72 million. The first two are scheduled to be delivered this year, and the rest by the end of 1989.    The sale will occur unless both houses of Congress vote within 30 days to block it, a Pentagon spokesman said. There is likely to be some criticism from lawmakers asserting that the sale will accelerate an arms race in Central America. The Reagan administration has warned the Soviet Union against sending advanced jet fighters to nearby Nicaragua, saying that such a Soviet move would upset the military balance of the region.    The administration, however, argues that the sale to Honduras won't change the military balance of the region because the F-5E isn't a particularly advanced jet -- it was first flown in 1972 -- and because the F-5Es are intended to replace aged French-made planes in the Honduran air force. </TEXT></DOC>
