A tentative contract, which affects more than 57,000 workers innine states and was expected to set a standard for other aircraftmanufacturers, was agreed upon early Sunday.   The agreement culminated 14 hours of talks during which afederal mediator took the unusual step of presenting his ownproposal. It was accepted by a 3-2 vote among negotiators for theInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.   The 48-day strike _ longest against The Boeing Co. in 41 years _has delayed deliveries of jets to airlines at a time of growingpassenger loads and rising concern over the nation's agingcommerical airline fleets.   Tom Baker, president of Machinists District Lodge 751, praisedthe three-year pact as a substantial improvement over two earlierBoeing offers.   ``I feel it will be ratified overwhelmingly,'' he said.   But Justin Ostro, an international vice president whocoordinates aerospace industry negotiations for the Machinists, hadharsh words for the agreement and the way it was reached.   ``There's a great deal of sacrifice on the part of thesemembers,'' Ostro said. ``They were entitled to a great deal more.''   Union members meet at Seattle's Kingdome at 8 p.m. PST to voteafter hearing an explanation and arguments about the contract.Meetings also are set for 5 p.m. CST in Wichita, Kan., and 8 p.m.in Portland, Ore.   Strikers picketing outside Boeing plants Sunday were happy tohear about the agreement.   Wichita striker Merle Barton said his co-workers would ratifyalmost anything.   ``I think people want to go back to work,'' Barton said. ``It'sa bad time for a working man to be out. Christmas is coming up.Taxes are coming up.''   ``I'm pretty sure everybody will go for it. We're tired ofstanding around in the rain,'' said Elaine Campbell, who was doingjust that outside a Boeing jet plant in suburban Renton.   Boeing chief negotiator Larry McKean said if the pact isapproved, strikers could return to work Wednesday. ``At this pointwe're looking forward to a favorable vote on this contract and areturn to normal operations,'' he said.   Analysts have said a settlement with the Boeing Machiniststraditionally sets the pattern for other aerospace companies,especially Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas, as well as for otherunions at Boeing.   Baker, whose lodge represents 43,300 of the 57,800 Boeingworkers covered by the pact, said the new offer providedimprovements in pay, medical coverage, overtime and the promotionsystem. He gave few details.   ``This proposal is very close to what people indicated (in unionmembership polls) they would accept,'' he said.   Ostro, however, said the settlement included about the sameannual wage gains _ 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent _ thatBoeing offered before the strike. Baker refused to reveal the newfigures.   The company proposed productivity bonuses of 10 percent of grosspay in the first year, 5 percent in the second and 4 percent in thethird, and a cost-of-living escalator would cover almost allinflation, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported today.   Before the strike, Boeing machinists earned $8.88 to $18.42 anhour, without counting lump sum bonuses.   Union and management negotiators had kind words for mediatorDoug Hammond's proposal. Hammond said it was only the second timehe had submitted his own proposed settlement in 15 years as amediator.   ``We were kind of at loggerheads,'' McKean said. ``It was goodand professional for him to step in.''   ``It was difficult for him to do,'' Baker said. ``Had bothparties not accepted, he would have been out as a mediator.''   Besides the Seattle-area workers, the contract covers 12,000 inWichita, 1,700 in Portland, and a few hundred others in California,Hawaii, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota and other states.   During the strike, Boeing used supervisory and non-strikingworkers to deliver 22 planes. But all were virtually completebefore the walkout.   Boeing has continued to accumulate record orders, including adeal last week with Delta Airlines for up to 100 jets potentiallyworth $4 billion.   That boosted Boeing's backlog of orders to 1,718 planes worth$85 billion, both aerospace industry records.   The last Boeing strike, in 1977, ended after 45 days. Itslongest walkout lasted 140 days in 1948.</TEXT></DOC>
