Because current laws make it difficult to pass on family businesses without enormous, even devastating taxes, he frets about the future of his family's Moscow, Pa., company, which makes plastic parts for machinery and packaging.    The thriving business, started in 1967, has a net worth of close to $5 million and employs 20 people. But because the company has grown so much in the past five years, if the father passed away today the estate would owe state inheritance taxes of $300,000 immediately and more than $3 million in cash over the next 15 years in federal inheritance taxes, the son says.    &quot;Such tax payments would keep us from needed expansion, new hiring and investing in research and development,&quot; Michael Steinmetz frets, adding that the family could be forced to sell the business. &quot;My 63-year-old father, Floyd, struggled for 22 years to build this business. . . . It's a tragedy he may not be able to pass the company on to his children.&quot;    Though tax reform was allegedly aimed at giving small business a break, recent changes in the estate-tax area have hurt family businesses more than they've helped. While taxes have been eliminated on certain smaller inheritances, the rates are still very high for big estates being passed along, totaling 20% to 55% for amounts up to $3 million and 55% or 60% for amounts over $3 million.    For small business, the biggest blow came in 1987 tax legislation, with the elimination of what was called the estate-tax freeze.    Before 1987, family-owned companies could avoid heavy future inheritance taxes by recapitalizing, giving the parents preferred stock and selling or giving the children all the common stock of the business. Through this setup, parents would get a steady income through preferred dividends while the taxes on the growth of the business beginning with the day of the transaction were passed on to the children. Because preferred stock remains valued at par regardless of how much the business grows, the recapitalization essentially froze the value of the portion owned by the parents. Thus, the parents' deaths wouldn't trigger enormous estate taxes.    The Steinmetz family's worries arrived with the elimination of that loophole. And the Steinmetz fear is shared by close to 20 million small, family-owned businesses in the U.S. Accountants say that thousands of businesses already have been sold after being hit with the tax burden. Although there are several bills in Congress to restore the estate-tax freeze, small businesses so far haven't been able to win enough legislative allies to get it passed this year, despite intense lobbying efforts by accountants, attorneys, farmers, ranchers, wine makers, grocers and other trade groups.    A bill in the House of Representatives is stalled behind capital-gains and Medicare catastrophic care legislative efforts. And in the Senate, three bills are unlikely to pass in 1989 unless the sponsors can figure out how to recoup $1.5 billion in estimated tax revenues that would be lost through 1995 by restoring the freeze.    &quot;The best advice I can give small-business men this year is not to die,&quot; says a legislative aide to U.S. Sen. John Heinz (R., Pa.). It was to Sen. Heinz that the younger Mr. Steinmetz complained about onerous estate taxes.    Besides the estate-tax freeze, there are some other ways to ease the inheritance-tax bite, but none is as effective and none works well enough to protect the parents' estate from paying a big tax if the business grows rapidly.    &quot;Without the estate-tax freeze, it's going to be much harder for a closely held business to survive in the future after the original owner's death without selling the business,&quot; says Bruce Thee, who heads the tax department in Reno, Nev., of Grant Thornton, a major accounting firm.    Even if the original owner gives his children significant portions of business in advance of death, as permitted by tax law, the estate-tax penalty can be overwhelming as long as any ownership is retained.    That fact has Kelly Hiatt concerned. Mr. Hiatt, president of Aandamp;K Earth Movers Inc. in Fallon, Nev., gave each of his three sons 25% ownership in 1987, using gift-tax exclusions, leaving himself with 25%. &quot;The business is currently worth about $1.8 million -- my portion would be $450,000 -- but it could easily go to $3 million or $4 million in net worth over the next few years,&quot; the 55-year-old Mr. Hiatt says. &quot;This means that my estate would still have to pay a pretty onerous tax on the increased valuation.&quot; To avoid saddling his children with those inheritance taxes, Mr. Hiatt may have to sell his 25% before he dies. &quot;I'm worried because I've seen too many families being forced to abandon their businesses because big estate taxes would paralyze its operations in the future.&quot;    Linda Marcus, who advises small businesses for First National City Bank in Chicago, says that business owners who are willing to plan early may ease the estate-tax impact. She cites one client, a retail store owner, who, when his business began expanding, had his two sons organize separate corporations in the growth areas.    &quot;In that way, he avoided massive estate taxes by giving up ownership,&quot; says Ms. Marcus. However, she adds, &quot;most fathers aren't willing to give up business control so early because they want to remain powerful or fear their kids aren't smart enough.&quot;    Arthur Levy, who runs a CPA firm by the same name, says one client passed along his company in the form of a gift to his son just as the business was coming out of bankruptcy. &quot;It wasn't worth anything then, so it qualified under the $10,000-a-year tax-free gift rule. But two years later, the company sold some real estate for millions of dollars, which avoided inheritance tax,&quot; Mr. Levy said.    Another way to ease estate taxes is to set up a buy-sell agreement between the parent owner and children before death, notes Sam Deutscher, a tax partner at Israeloff, Trattner andamp; Co., a Valley Stream, N.Y., accounting firm. &quot;If based on a fair market value at the time of the agreement, this setup can avoid estate taxes on appreciation in value,&quot; he says.    Increasingly, business owners are buying life insurance to pay for estate taxes when the businesses pass to their children. Arthur Hoffman, a tax partner with Spicer andamp; Oppenheim, a New York accounting firm, notes that a policy called &quot;second-to-die life&quot; avoids estate taxes entirely but has a high annual cost. &quot;The policy pays off after both spouses die,&quot; Mr. Hoffman says. &quot;But to avoid estate taxes, the children must own and pay for the policy.&quot;    Joan Vines, a senior manager in taxes for Peat Marwick in Washington, D.C., observes that an estate can defer inheritance taxes for five years and then pay them over the next 10 years under certain conditions. &quot;The heirs must begin paying annual interest on the estate the first year,&quot; she says. &quot;The decedent must have owned more than 20% of the business, there should be 15 or fewer shareholders in the business and the value of the business must exceed 35% of the adjusted gross value {the value after gifts} of the estate.&quot;    But despite all these tactics, without the estate-tax freeze, &quot;there really isn't very much a small-business man can do to avoid estate taxes,&quot; says Byrle M. Abbin, managing director of Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.'s office of federal tax services in Washington. &quot;Until Congress acts or the Internal Revenue Service eases its interpretation of the 1987 law eliminating the freeze, the small-business man will suffer.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
