Intel said it signed a letter of intent with VLSI, SanJose, Calif., as part of the talks. The chip makers said theywon't give more details until they reach an agreement.</LP><TEXT>   Sharing technologies would make sense for Intel and VLSI,whose strengths are very different. Intel is the world'sbiggest supplier of microprocessors, the chips that becomethe brains of computers. VLSI's specialty is in chips calledapplication-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which canbe tailored for specific functions.   Intel has attempted to enter the ASIC market in the past,never with very successful results. Among VLSI's products aresets of chips that personal-computer makers use inside theirmachines alongside Intel's microprocessors. The companieshave a previous agreement under which Intel buys such chipsets from VLSI and resells them to its own customers.</TEXT></DOC>
