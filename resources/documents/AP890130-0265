The Commerce Department said the gain in income, adjusted forinflation, was the best since a 3.9 percent gain in 1986 and morethan double 1987's 1.7 percent.   In other economic news, the stock market continued its march pastpre-crash levels Monday, while a new survey showed the cost ofemployer-sponsored health-care plans increased dramatically lastyear.   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 1.25 points to2,324.11, its highest close since the market crash in October 1987.   The health-care survey by A. Foster Higgins andamp; Co. in New Yorkfound that health-care costs rose 18.6 percent per worker last yearafter increases of 7.7 percent in 1986 and 7.9 percent in 1987.   In December, personal income totaled $4.2 trillion, with much ofthe $37.1 billion jump from November resulting from farm subsidypayments. Without those outlays, the government said, December'stotal income would have been up 0.8 percent.   Last year's income gains spurred both spending and saving:   _Consumer spending rose 2.8 percent after adjusting forinflation, following increases of 2.7 percent in 1987 and 4.3percent in 1986.   In December alone, spending rose 0.9 percent, with the biggestincrease, 4.1 percent, posted for durable goods _ ``big ticket''items expected to last three or more years.   _The average personal savings rate rose a full percentage point,from 3.2 percent to 4.2 percent, the highest since the 4.4 percentset in 1985.   The 1987 rate was the smallest since a 3.1 percent rate in 1947.   In all, economists said the figures were a good sign forcontinued economic strength in the coming year.   ``There's a balanced picture for consumers, with a strongincrease in income, a solid increase in spending and some increasein savings,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co.``All three of those ... are quite desirable if the expansion isgoing to keep on rolling along.''   Added Robert G. Dederick, an economist with Northern Trust Co. inChicago:   ``People continue to fill their wallets and then they continue toempty them and this clearly should provide the impetus for a furtherpush in growth in the first half of 1989.''   However, Lawrence Chimerine, head of the WEFA Group, an economicconsulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., cautioned that much of theyear's income growth came from increases in employment and could notbe expected to continue unabated. Joblessness was at a 14-year lowin 1988.   ``Once we run out of people to put into the labor force, we'llsee much smaller growth in income,'' Chimerine said.   Both Dederick and Chimerine said the savings rate still was toolow and that while the spending and income picture for 1988 wasgenerally good, high levels of spending have made it more difficultto narrow the nation's trade deficit as consumers fail to curb theirappetite for foreign goods.   The year ended on a strong note as personal income in December,before adjusting for inflation, rose 0.9 percent.   Wages and salaries, a key component of income, were up 0.6percent to $2.53 trillion in December following a revised 0.3percent gain a month earlier. The volatile category of farm incomesoared 73.2 percent to $23.9 billion after plunging 66.8 percent inNovember.   Sinai said the year-end strength ``was impressive and suggeststhat consumers will have the wherewithall to keep spending for anumber of months.''   ``There are no impediments in sight to continued good growth inincome and consumption,'' he said. ``The consumer is supportive ofour expansion at this point, neither spending in a boom-like way norshowing any signs of a fade in spending.''</TEXT></DOC>
