(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a state where two of the Wild West'ssharpest shooters left their marks, judges can't decide whether avoter-approved constitutional amendment means that anyone can carrya gun.   The Nebraska Supreme Court has been asked to step in and settlethe dispute.   Some judges in the western part of the state, where Buffalo BillCody had a ranch, say the statutes limiting possession of firearmsare now unconstitutional because of Initiative 403, which wasapproved by voters last fall.   Some judges in the eastern part of the state, the site of WildBill Hickok's first killing, have read the new constitutionallanguage to allow for reasonable state regulation of guns.   And attorneys for one man on death row have argued in federalcourt that the language of the amendment also outlawed the deathpenalty.   In coming weeks, the high court will hear oral arguments in twocases that were dismissed by Lincoln County District Court judgesbecause of the constitutional amendment. One is against a felonaccused of possessing a firearm; the other involves a man accusedof having a firearm on which the serial number had been defaced.   J.W. Carlson of Crofton, spokesman for the National RifleAssociation and a backer of the initiative petition that put theamendment before voters, said the amendment was intended only toprotect the lawful possession of guns.   In briefs filed Monday, Lincoln County Attorney Kent Turnbullsaid District Judges John P. Murphy and Donald E. Rowlands II erredin tossing out the separate gun cases.   The judges ruled that the amendment invalidated existingstatutes regulating guns.   But judges in Douglas County, which includes Omaha, have saidthe new language should be read to coexist with the regulatorystatutes.   Turnbull said in his brief that the intent of the amendment``was to protect only lawful possession of firearms. Lawfulpossession of firearms is that which was lawful when the measurewas adopted. The state may regulate the right to bear arms as areasonable exercise of the state's police power.''   Turnbull argued that prohibiting possession of a defacedfirearm, and prohibiting a felon from possessing a firearm, ``bearsa reasonable relationship to promoting the public safety and istherefore a lawful exercise of the state's police power.''   Before Initiative 403 was adopted the state Constitution said:   ``All persons are by nature free and independent, and havecertain inherent and inalienable rights; among these are life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness.''   The amendment added a section so that the second part of thepassage now reads: ``...among these are life, liberty and thepursuit of happiness and the right to keep and bear arms forsecurity or defense of self, family, home and others, and forlawful common defense, hunting, recreational use, and all otherlawful purposes, and such rights shall not be denied or infringedby the state or any subdivision thereof.''   Attorneys for convicted contract killer C. Michael Anderson saidthey believe the language of the amendment repeals the deathpenalty because it cites life as an inalienable right.   They have filed a lawsuit in Lancaster County District Courtasking that Anderson's death sentence be set aside.</TEXT></DOC>
