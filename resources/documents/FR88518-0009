This rule amends Export Control Commodity Number (ECCN)1203A on the CCL by imposing a control on vacuum furnaces capable of operatingwith protective atmospheres. This amendment has resulted from a reviewof strategic controls maintained by the U.S. and certain allied countriesthrough the Coordinating Committee (COCOM). Such multilateral controlsrestrict the availability of strategic items to controlled countries. Withthe concurrence of the Department of Defense, the Department of Commercehas determined that this amendment to the CCL is necessary to protect U.S.national security interests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>May 18, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>For questions of a technicalnature on electric furnaces (ECCN 1203), call Surendra Dhir, Capital GoodsTechnology Center, Bureau of Export Administration, Telephone: (202) 377-8550.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Saving Clause</ITAG>Shipments of items removed from general license authorizations as a resultof this regulation that were on dock for lading, on lighter, laden aboardan exporting carrier, or en route aboard a carrier to a port of exportpursuant to actual orders for export before (two weeks after date of publication)may be exported under the general license provisions up to and including(four weeks after date of publication).

Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared.2. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule also is exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does notrequire that this rule be published in proposed form because this ruleimplements regulatory changes based on COCOM review. Further, no otherlaw requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity forpublic comment be given for this rule.3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.4. This rule mentions a collection of information subject to the requirementsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This collection has been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget under control number 0625-0001.5. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.Accordingly, it is being issued in final form.
