This so-called Earth Summit is beingpromoted by environmental activist groups around the worldand by certain political leaders. Untroubled by lack ofscientific support for catastrophic global warming, they aimto impose a system of global environmental regulations in thename of saving the planet. The White House has so far refusedto be stampeded; but with elections upon us anything canhappen.   Why all this frantic activity leading up to the EarthSummit, which will bring some 40,000 participants to Brazil,with travel costs soon to exceed half a billion dollars? Weare dealing here with a curious alliance of interest groups.Central planners and assorted utopians would like to placenatural resources and even national economies underinternational controls, preferably theirs. There are stillmany around who supported the failed Law of the Seanegotiations to set up an international regime for exploitingocean minerals; they now see an opportunity to achieve theiraim of global environmental controls under U.N. bureaucrats.</LP><TEXT>   To be sure, there are many who are sincerely concernedabout the future of the planet; they are the &quot;foot soldiers&quot;of the environmental movement. The &quot;generals,&quot; however, seemmore interested in salaries, personal power and perks. Withbudgets now surpassing $400 million a year collectively, theofficers of these organizations spend their time travelingfrom conference to conference, extorting funds from industry,and -- with the help of the media -- frightening the averageAmerican into writing those $10 and $20 checks that form thebulk of their support.   But UNCED covers more than just the environment. The &quot;D&quot;stands for &quot;development,&quot; and to many in the Third World thismeans the New International Economic Order -- which theyfailed to achieve 20 years ago through the U.N. GeneralAssembly. Cynics then referred to the NIEO as a &quot;scheme oftransferring money from the poor in the rich countries to therich in the poor countries.&quot;   Third World kleptocrats now view UNCED as the vehicle toreconstitute this scheme under the guise of ecology. Theycall for industrialized nations, which currently contributemost of the carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, to impose ahuge tax on all fuels, and then transfer the proceeds throughan international authority to less developed countries.According to Department of Energy calculations, Americanconsumers would end up paying twice as much for gasoline andelectric power, a scheme guaranteed to stunt U.S. economicgrowth. But limiting growth has always been among theannounced goals of radical environmentalists -- even if theburden falls mainly on the poor.   We are seeing this struggle now on a small scale in theNorthwest, where protection of 250 northern spotted owls willresult in, by conservative estimates, the loss of 33,000jobs. Another example is the controversial wetlands policythat permits the Environmental Protection Agency to removeprivate land from development -- without compensation --under the pretext that it has ecological value.   Influential politicians support UNCED, including such U.S.senators as Al Gore (D., Tenn.). Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell has just published a book, &quot;World on Fire,&quot; thatendorses both the global warming scare and the controls onenergy use that UNCED hopes to impose on the industrializedcountries. And it is the Senate that would ratify anyinternational agreements resulting from UNCED.   The U.S. is certain to play the key role in the outcome ofUNCED. The White House, to its credit, has resisted theexample of Germany, Australia and other nations. They haveannounced specific targets for not just capping but reducingcarbon dioxide emissions, by as much as 25% over the nextdecade or two, but have yet to detail their policies or thetremendous costs involved.   Pressure is mounting on the U.S. to exercise &quot;leadership&quot;by abandoning its present position; the U.S. currently callsfor limiting the full &quot;basket&quot; of greenhouse gases, ratherthan only carbon dioxide, and avoids specific targets andtimetables. Until recently, the U.S. point man was JohnSununu, then White House chief of staff. As a scientist andengineer, he understood that the scientific climate data donot support the catastrophic warming theories.   Sam Skinner, the new chief of staff, will have to resolvethe differences between alarmists within EPA and others,including Department of Energy officials and White HouseScience Adviser Allan Bromley, who have been urging a go-slowapproach until a scientific basis has been more firmlyestablished.   The key decision will focus on whether George Bush shouldattend the Earth Summit -- as the democratic presidentialcandidates are urging. His presence in Rio would put hisprestige and that of the U.S. behind the rush to imposeglobal controls on energy use that will have a calamitousimpact on jobs, technological progress, and standards ofliving.   ---   Mr. Singer, professor of atmospheric physics at theUniversity of Virginia, directs the Science and EnvironmentalPolicy Project in Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
