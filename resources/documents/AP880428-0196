The vote was the third time in two days theDemocratic-controlled chamber approved arms control restrictionsopposed by President Reagan.   Earlier in the day, the chamber rejected a proposal to ban allfinal-stage tests of an anti-satellite weapon. But the Air Forcesays it already has dropped development of the weapon because ofearlier congressional restrictions.   The decisions came as the House worked on a bill authorizing thePentagon budget for the fiscal year which begins Oct. 1.   All three arms control votes were essentially repeats ofrestrictions added by the House last year to its Pentagon budgetbill.   Meanwhile, the Senate Armed Services Committee finished workThursday on its version of a Pentagon budget bill. Even though thatpanel also is controlled by Democrats, the administration's defenseprogram fared better in the committee than it did in the HouseArmed Services Committee.   For example, the only arms control restriction the Senate panelapproved was a ban on any tests of Reagan's Star Wars system thatwould violate the ``narrow'' interpretation of the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.   The House and Senate bills both authorize $299.5 billion inPentagon spending for the next fiscal year, a figure set by lastDecember's budget summit between Reagan and Congress designed toreduce federal deficits.   Differences between the two measures will have to be reconciledlater by a House-Senate conference committee.   In votes Thursday, the House:</TEXT><TEXT>   _Decided, on the 214-186 decision that went generally alongparty lines, to ban all underground nuclear tests of weapons largerthan one kiloton. The decision came after the House passed, 399-0,a Republican-backed amendment praising Reagan's effort to negotiatelimits on testing.   The ban was voted last year by the House, but was dropped by theHouse-Senate conference committee and ended up as only an advisoryrequest.   Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., told the House the ban would``totally undercut our negotiators,'' a reference to the ongoingU.S.-Soviet talks aimed at a comprehensive ban on all nuclear tests.   But Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said, ``We owe it to ourchildren'' to vigorously pursue a total ban on all atomic tests.   Open-air atomic tests are banned by a 1963 treaty, but that pactallows underground tests.   _Rejected, 205-197, the anti-satellite ban proposed for a fourthyear by Rep. George Brown, D-Calif. But the panel also turned down,212-195, a proposal to spend $100 million for development of aground-based anti-satellite weapon.   The restriction had been imposed by Congress the past threeyears and the Pentagon responded by dropping work on the program todevelop an ASAT weapon fired from a high-flying F-15 jet.   Instead, the Air Force is working on different types of ASATs,particularly those using ground-based lasers.   Earlier in the week, the House had voted to ban any Star Warstests that would violate the narrow interpretation of the ABM pact.It also voted to require continued compliance with numerical limitsin the unratified 1979 SALT II pact.   ``The only restriction we added was the ABM intepretationlanguage,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the panel.   The Senate panel recommended $4.6 billion for the StrategicDefense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known. The bill on theHouse floor provides $4 billion, although next week's scheduleddebate over SDI could mean changes in that total.   Currently, SDI receives $3.9 billion and Reagan had sought $4.8billion for the next fiscal year.   The Senate measure also includes a proposal creating a Pentagoncommission which would determine unneeded military bases that couldbe closed. No similar proposal is part of the House bill.   The Senate bill also approved Reagan's request for a 4.3 percentpay hike for America's 2.1 million uniformed military personnel.The House measure proposes a 4 percent increase.</TEXT></DOC>
