Most of the settlement will be paid by insurance, Tigera said.    The class-action suit against the office automation concern, formerly known as Fortune Systems Corp., alleged securities law violations and other problems in connection with its March 1983 initial public offering. The year of the offering, the company's stock plunged almost 75% amid rapidly falling revenue and product development concerns.    Tigera said the settlement, subject to a further definitive agreement and court approval, also involves several officers and directors as well as securities firms that handled the initial offering.    The company said the settlement is &quot;substantially funded&quot; by insurance, and that Tigera's out-of-pocket contribution will be &quot;less than $750,000.&quot; Tigera said some reserves were previously established to cover the litigation. While it said it hadn't yet decided whether the reserves were adequate, the settlement wouldn't materially affect earnings or its financial position.    In general, Tigera said, the settlement money will go to shareholders who bought or sold its stock between the time of the March 1983 offering and June 1983 disclosures by the company.    The plaintiffs' attorneys' fees will be awarded out of the $12 million total, Tigera said, but added that the fee amount hadn't yet been determined.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Tigera closed at $1.9375, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
