The Labor Department reported this morning that the unemploymentrate declined to 5.0 percent, a new 15-year low, in March, from 5.1percent the month before. That surprised analysts, who had beenlooking for a small increase.   By contrast, the data also showed a smaller-than-expected gainof 180,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, providing some supportfor the view that the economy has been slowing since early thisyear.   Brokers said the overall result was something of a letdown,since many investors had been hoping for a more clear-cut signalthat pressures were abating on inflation and interest rates.   But traders also apparently interpreted the data as positive fortechnology stocks, which have been depressed lately by earningsworries and concern about a possible business slump.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
