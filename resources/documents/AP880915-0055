The measure was passed Wednesday by 410-0, but its fate isunclear in the Senate, where the legislation may not advance unlessthe House approves a Senate-passed banking bill.   When the House measure was debated on Tuesday, supporters citedthe steady stream of big-money insider trading cases that haveattracted widespread public attention in recent years.   Just last Wednesday, the investment firm Drexel Burnham LambertInc. was named in a civil complaint filed by the Securities andExchange Commission charging insider trading, fraud and otherviolations.   ``The single drumbeats that began two years ago have threatenedto become a deafening symphony of illegality that would drown outthe voices of those honest small investors and market professionalswho seek to be heard in our securities markets,'' said Rep. EdwardMarkey, D-Mass., chairman of the House telecommunications andfinance subcommittee, where the bill originated.   The legislation would expose securities companies to fines ifthe firm ``knew or recklessly disregarded'' that its employeescommitted insider trading violations. The fines would be up totriple the profits gained or loss avoided or $1 million, whicheverwas greater.   Maximum criminal fines for insider trading convictions would beboosted from $100,000 to $1 million for individuals and from$500,000 to $2.5 million for companies. The maximum jail term wouldbe doubled to 10 years.   The SEC would be allowed to award bounty payments to peoplewhose tips result in insider trading prosecutions. The bountiescould be as much as 10 percent of penalty imposed or the settlementreached with the convicted trader.   In addition, investors who lost money because of insider tradingwould be allowed to seek damages from the insider traders.   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., chairman of the Senate BankingCommittee, said last week he is considering withholding similarlegislation unless House leaders reverse course and agree to move ameasure giving banks new power to underwrite securities.</TEXT></DOC>
