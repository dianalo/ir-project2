Requirements, operating conditions, and resultingoptions for plasma exhaust and fuel processing are discussed. An integratedprocess for exhaust pumping, impurity removal, and impurity processingis outlined. This process is based as much as possible on proven elements,or those under intensive investigation in fusion facilities around theworld. The integration of a cyrogenic roughing pump with helium pump-throughand total reflux of the electrolyzer products are novel process enhancements.</TEXT></DOC>
