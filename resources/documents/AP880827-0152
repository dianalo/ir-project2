The accident on Friday killed four people and three other crewmembers still were missing, Peru's navy said in a statement.   The navy said earlier that 22 sailors wearing life preservershad been plucked from the Pacific Ocean as the vessel sank.   But rescuers had struggled since late Friday to rescue sailorsstill believed trapped alive in the vessel after it sank in 96 feetof water near the port city of Callao.   Using a diving bell and retrieving officers two at a time,rescuers pulled 21 sailors from the submarine by late Saturday,officials said.   President Alan Garcia told reporters that three men were takenunconscious from the stricken vessel, and that they may have beenovercome by fumes in the submarine. There was no word on theircondition.   He said the three sailors still not accounted for could be inwater-filled compartments of the vessel. Garcia spoke to reportersin his office after spending several hours at the accident site.   The submarine Pacocha sank after being accidentally rammedFriday evening by the Japanese fishing ship No. 8 Kyowa-Maru nearthe Callao, the navy and the Japanese Embassy said.   The navy said in a communique that the craft's commandingofficer, Daniel Nieve, and three junior officers had been killed.   The navy on Saturday had issued several conflicting figures onthe number of men on board the ship, the number believed missingand those feared trapped in the sunken vessel.   It said 52 crew members were believed on board when thecollision occurred and said 45 were rescued. But the 22 crewmembers rescued Friday and 21 rescued Saturday total 43, and therewas no explanation given for the discrepancy.   Rescuers used a diving bell that connected to the hatch of thesubmarine and began bringing crew members to the surface from thesubmarine Saturday morning.   Callao, Peru's largest port, is eight miles west of Lima. Porttraffic was banned until Monday to facilitate rescue operations,the port authority said Saturday.   Cmdr. Luis Castro, a navy spokesman, said the 1,870-tonsubmarine, which was cruising on the surface toward the port, sankshortly after being rammed on the left stern side by the 412-ton,steel-hulled fishing boat.   There were no reported injuries on the fishing boat.   A U.S. Embassy spokesman who declined to be named said the U.S.Navy was sending a special team and equipment aboard three C-141transport planes to assist in the rescue operations.   Garcia said Peru officials decided to mount their rescue afterdetermining that it was too dangerous to wait for a special U.S.Navy rescue crew to arrive Saturday night.   Sources close to the rescue said the trapped men were believedto have been in the forward part of the submarine and had sealedthe section with hatch doors from the rest of the vessel, which isbelieved filled with water.   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an airline running to the surface had been attached, giving survivors anunlimited supply of air.   The Peru navy said the submarine was purchased in 1974 from theU.S. government. The vessel, formerly the U.S.S. Atule, wascommissioned on June, 21, 1944, according to Jane's Fighting Ships.   The submarine sank shortly after impact, Castro said, adding hedid not know the extent of the damage to the craft.   Castro said divers working since 8 p.m. Friday made contact withcrewmen inside the sunken vessel.   The Callao port authority said the submarine was heading fornaval ship repair docks and the Japanese boat, carrying a crew of21, was leaving port to fish when the accident occurred.   The Japanese boat, skippered by Tsukasa Ohkado, suffered somecracks on the bow, the Japanese Embassy said Saturday.   The embassy said 16 of the Japanese boat's crew are Japanese andthe remaining five are Peruvians.</TEXT></DOC>
