For the second day, the nation's leaders appeared on anationally televised parliamentary session to outline theirposition, which has strained the alliance. Italy, Belgium, Denmarkand Norway have sided with Bonn in the growing rift. Most of NATO'sshort-range missiles are based in West Germany.   A government spokesman, Hans Klein, said Dutch Premier RuudLubbers will visit Bonn on Wednesday for talks with ChancellorHelmut Kohl in an apparent bid to resolve the dispute before a NATOsummit next month.   The Dutch government has expressed support for the U.S. andBritish position and has offered to mediate in the dispute.   ``The West has no reason to be timid or to be concerned,''Genscher said in his address. Rather, Genscher said, Westernnations should have the confidence to pursue a course that wouldinclude short-range missiles among the various arms already underdiscussion among the superpowers.   ``We must courageously and decisively make use of the newopenness the Soviet Union is showing,'' said Genscher, a member ofthe detente-oriented, centrist Free Democratic Party. ``We mustclose that hole in the disarmament chain.''   Speaking of the West German demand for negotiations aimed atreducing the number of short-range missiles, Genscher said: ``Wecan see that we are finding more and more understanding for thisposition within the whole alliance.''   Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg spoke after Genscher andalso emphasized that West Germany remains bound to NATO.   Stoltenberg said it was ``totally unfounded'' to say that Kohl'sgovernment could accept a loosening of ties between Bonn and itsWestern allies.   Kohl on Thursday made a speech before parliament in which hereaffirmed his call for talks with Moscow over the short-rangemissiles.   Such talks are strongly opposed by the United States andBritain, which fear the negotiations could lead to the removal ofshort-range weapons and leave Western Europe dangerously exposed toWarsaw Pact's superior conventional forces.   Public opinion polls indicate a large majority of West Germansare opposed to the modernization of the weapons.   The issue is causing a division among NATO allies before the May29-30 summit in Brussels, where the Western alliance hopes to reacha common position on the missiles.   Kohl is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcherof Britain on Sunday, when the two are expected to discuss theissue. Thatcher has strongly criticized Kohl's proposal for talkswith the Warsaw Pact.   The United States has launched a diplomatic offensive againstKohl's proposal, instructing its ambassadors in NATO countries topresent arguments against starting up negotiations on short-rangeweapons.   Kohl's government has been losing support among voters and thecall for talks is designed to improve its standing before nextyear's federal elections.   Kohl also has called on the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationto delay a decision on replacing the aging short-range Lancenuclear missiles until after federal elections next year.   Recent polls indicate that three-quarters of the West Germanpopulation favors eliminating nuclear weapons in Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
