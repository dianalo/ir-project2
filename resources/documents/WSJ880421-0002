The dollar was prevented from rising by the overwhelmingly bearish outlook prompted by last week's report of an unexpectedly wide U.S. trade deficit for February. It was kept from falling, meanwhile, by traders' fears of central bank intervention.    &quot;The tone is very negative, but nobody's willing to take the initiative to push the dollar lower,&quot; one trader said.    The U.S. currency stood yesterday in late New York trading at 1.6670 marks, compared with 1.6630 late Tuesday, and at 124.25 yen, unchanged from a day earlier.    The report from the Labor Department yesterday that the U.S. consumer price index rose 0.5% in March was within market expectations and didn't affect trading, dealers said.    The Canadian dollar made an early surge as market participants sought high-yielding currencies to profit from an otherwise lackluster market. During the morning in New York, the Canadian dollar rose to 81.47 U.S. cents. Dealers said the Bank of Canada began intervening around 81.40 cents but only slowed the currency's rise. Profit-taking pushed it back down to 81.33 cents late in the day, compared with 81.35 cents late Tuesday.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $1.40 an ounce to $457.00 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 2.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $455.35 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                      LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Wednesday, April 20, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
