The primary objective is to apply roboticsto select areas of nuclear materials handling and processing operations.The overriding impetus is the reduction of low-level radiation exposureto operating personnel. These goals are being realized by employing industrialand laboratory robots to develop automation and robotic systems to processnuclear materials. Since the robotics industry focuses on major productionmarkets, the nuclear industry related problems such as equipment sizedfor glovebox operation, construction materials that are radiation andcorrosion resistant, and determining which systems will operate in corrosiveand/or inert atmospheres need to be addressed. The Robotics section hasrealized several of these major goals and is now beginning to apply robotictechnology to other research efforts at Los Alamos. These new initiativesinclude: the design of a custom gantry robot; automation of molecularbiology processes in support of the Human Genome Project; use of artificialintelligence and knowledge based systems; automation and robotics forthe planned Space Station mission; and other areas of research and development.</TEXT></DOC>
