Arterial visualization was divided into threeclasses and skin temperatures were recorded. Phentolamine afforded verygood visualization of the distal arterial bed in 95% of the limbs. Astrong correlation was observed between the mean temperature rise inthe feet and the angiographic class of arterial visualization (classA: 2.16{sup 0}C; class B: 1.31{sup 0}C; class C: 0.85{sup 0}C) (FisherF tests). No side effects were recorded. The routine use of intrarterialphentolamine in lower extremity arteriography is recommended.</TEXT></DOC>
