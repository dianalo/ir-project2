Col. Orlando Zepeda, commander of the brigade, told journalistssix rebels were killed in the fighting, which panicked thousands ofresidents of the city's northern sector. He said five militarizedNational Police, one army soldier and three civilians were wounded.   The fighting was the heaviest in the capital in at least a year.   Zepeda said four men aboard a jeep fired U.S.-made M-69 grenadesand Soviet-made RPG-18 rocket-propelled grenades into the brigadeheadquarters at dusk.   He said six or seven projectiles landed inside the baseperimeter, causing property damage but no casualties.   The brigade commander said combat in the neighborhoods ofZacamil, Mejicanos and around the headquarters of Transit Policebroke out after police and soldiers clashed with retreatingguerrillas. He estimated about 30 insurgents took part in theattack.   Rebel spokespersons called several local radio stations to saythe strike comprised coordinated attacks on four military andpolice posts. The rebels said the actions was part of an offensivecalled ``All against Arena. We're Going to Win.''   President-elect Alfredo Cristiani of the rightist RepublicanNationalist Alliance, or Arena, is to take office from outgoingChristian Democrat Jose Napoleon Duarte on June 1.   Earlier Thursday, the rebels declared a natiowide transport banfor the inauguration.   ``We call on all our units to enforce the ban and the people toobserve it in repudiation of this government from the moment of itsinception,'' said a communique issued by the high command of theFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN.   The indefinite ban is to begin at 12:01 a.m. May 31. Previoustransport bans have lasted an average of three days.   An estimated 7,000 Marxist-led guerrillas are waging a9-year-old revolution against the U.S.-backed government. The warhas killed about 70,000 people, most of them civilians.   The rebels periodically call transport bans and enforce themwith threats and sabotage. The previous ban, during the March 19presidential election, virtually paralyzed interprovincialtransport.</TEXT></DOC>
