Does RJR Nabisco still make Oreos?, the broker asked.Assured that it did, he promptly put the stock on his buylist.</LP><TEXT>   Two years after going private in the biggest everleveraged buy-out, RJR has returned to the New York StockExchange. The stock, now trading on a &quot;when issued&quot; basis,topped the most-active list for seven days in a row as itsurged to 7 1/4 from 5 1/2 on Feb. 1.   RJR is especially hot with brokers catering to smallinvestors. Some of these brokers are pushing the stock as thebest thing since, well -- the old RJR Nabisco.   But investors will need to digest a lot more than RJR'strademarked, cream-filled cookie to understand the company'snew look. Though the Oreo hasn't changed, practicallyeverything else about the company has.   Naturally, the new RJR has much more debt. Total debt,even after some repayments the past two years, is $17.9billion, more than triple the pre-buy-out level. Moretellingly, the company's product mix is changed. Thepre-buy-out RJR, like Philip Morris today, diversified itselfby funneling tobacco cash flow into food companyacquisitions. Today RJR relies on tobacco for 78% of itsoperating profit -- up from 63% in 1988 -- and its dependenceon tobacco is expected to increase in years ahead.   RJR also has cut a lot of waste. Most, though not all, ofthe corporate jets and glitzy sports promotions are gone, asis the openhanded spending style of F. Ross Johnson, RJR'sformer boss.   But the real magic has come at the operating level. Profitmargins in domestic tobacco have risen by 31%; in overseastobacco by 17%. And in food, shrunken by asset sales, marginshave climbed by 22%.   On the down side, RJR's share of the U.S. tobacco markethas slipped, in part because archrival Philip Morris hasconcentrated on marketing its dominant Marlboro brand whileRJR has had its ears pinned to the task of paying down debt.   All these changes have sharply altered how the publicought to size up RJR as an investment. Before the buy-out itwas a so-called safe stock -- clip the dividend, watchearnings grow, and pray that management didn't make a mess ofreinvesting profits.   Now RJR has become what one fan calls a &quot;high-octane&quot;stock. It pays no dividend, and won't for a good while. Ithasn't any per-share earnings and won't have significant netincome for at least a couple of years. What RJR has is theoctane of leverage, harnessed to a business almost whollydependent on tobacco.   If, as analysts predict, RJR's operating profit increases10% or about $300 million annually, a bit less than its ratesince the buy-out, the bottom line should improve muchfaster. Kidder Peabody's Roy Burry looks for negligibleper-share earnings this year, a dime or two in 1992 and asmuch as $1 in 1994.   In a way, the buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.solved the tobacconist's perennial problem of what to do withexcess cash flow. RJR is on a forced march to reduce debt, abetter use of cash than it might have found outside thelucrative tobacco business. And last week Moody's InvestorsService upgraded RJR's junk-rated senior debt to one notchbelow investment grade. If cash flow keeps rising, RJR mightbe able to win an investment-grade rating and refinance itscostliest debt, which pays 15% to 17 3/8%. Such a move islikely to be years rather than months away, but is beingexplored by KKR. The potential saving -- on the order of $400million in annual interest -- does tend to grab an investor'seye.   High octane, of course, can backfire. Though RJR seems tohave avoided the graveyard of many late-1980s LBOs, a smalldisappointment in operating profit would leave the companywith much less in net income than investors expect. GivenRJR's recent rally, Mr. Burry and some of his peers believetoo much optimism is already factored into the stock. Otheranalysts, such as Salomon Brothers' Diana Temple, aregung-ho. But the Street remains unsure of how to value RJR.If meaningful earnings are years away, what is the stockworth now?   RJR, in the midst of a bond swap offer, won't comment.Equally silent is KKR -- which owns about 59% of the stock ona fully diluted basis and isn't expected to sell shares formany years. And so it is up to the public -- which, with 175million shares and warrants, has a 17% stake -- to value thecompany.   One way is to compare RJR's cash flow with its stock andoutstanding debt. For $25.9 billion, for instance, a mythicalinvestor could buy all of RJR's stock and retire all of itsdebt. That would mean paying about seven times RJR's 1991estimated cash flow, or earnings before interest, taxes andamortization, of $3.68 billion. Philip Morris, measured bythe same yardstick, trades at a slightly more pricey multipleof 7.4 times cash flow.   Philip Morris, with its stronger balance sheet andstronger cigarette brands, probably deserves a highermultiple. Thus, relative to Philip Morris, RJR hardly lookscheap.   A more serious question involves the decline of RJR's toptwo cigarette brands, Winston and Salem. So far, theindustry's ability to raise prices has enabled RJR to boostcash flow from tobacco even as the number of packs sold fell.If that pattern continues, RJR's lack of diversificationmight not be the negative that analysts suggest. In financialterms, tobacco is a dream of a business; the product isaddictive, and the threat of litigation deters competition.   But according to Wheat First Securities analyst JackMaxwell, the combined market share of Winston and Salemtumbled to 14.9% last year from 18% in 1988. Even in tobacco,such slides can't be long endured. RJR's easy gains fromcost-cutting are behind it. With U.S. cigarette consumptionshrinking a steady 2% to 3% a year, shoring up Winston andSalem becomes all the more urgent.   RJR's old management tried to revive Winston for years andfailed. Its new management aims to do better. A touched-upWinston featuring new paper, new filter and new packaging isin the works. Most important will be RJR's marketing --aiming at capturing some of Marlboro's market and riddingWinston of its stodgy image. After that, it will be Salem'sturn.   It will be years before the results of these campaigns areknown, and on them rests much of RJR's future. RJR'sde-leveraging plan hinges on its ability to cut interestexpense and return to investmentgrade status. In large part,says William Wetreich, senior vice president of Standard andamp;Poor's, that depends on &quot;stabilizing market share&quot; intobacco.   ---                                                                                                          A Much-Changed RJR Nabisco Returns to the Stock Market                                                                                                             SIZE                  PRE-BUY-OUT        RJR NOW                                1988            1990                                                                                                         Revenue                   $17.0 billion     $13.9 billion  Operating profit          $2.97 billlion    $3.43 billion  Total employees           116,881           64,000*  Tobacco market share      31.8%             29.6%  Share of Operating    profits from tobacco    63%               78%  Whosesale price of    1,000 Winstons          $43.65            $55.75  Price of 20-oz    box of of Oreos         $2.49             $2.61                                                                                                             EFFICIENCY                                                                                                         Domestic tobacco    profit margins          30.2%            39.7%  Corporate expense         $166 million     $105 million  Tax expense               $893 million     $60 million                                                                                                             FINANCIAL STATUS                                                                                                         Credit rating             Single-A         Double-A  Operating profit/interest    coverage ratio          4.9 times        1.5 times  Net income (loss)         $1.4 billion     ($0.43billion)  Market value of common**    and preferred           $25.3 billion#   $8.0 billion##  Face value of debt**      $5.2 billion##   $17.9 billion##  Total enterprise value    $30.6 billion    $25.9 billion                                                                                                          *Excludes work force at Del Monte and other divested units   **Assumes completion of current exchange offer   #As of Feb. 9, 1989   ##As of Feb. 12, 1981                                                                                                          Sources: RJR Nabisco Inc; Wheat First Securities Inc.;Kidder Peabody andamp; Co.</TEXT></DOC>
