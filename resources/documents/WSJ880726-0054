As taxpayers, we are being ripped off by the Pentagon and its defense-industry cohorts. It's time to put a stop not only to high-tech $700 coffee urns, but also to &quot;sophisticated&quot; weapons that don't work.    Compensation to the victims is being proposed. Their families should be compensated. At least half of such compensation should be borne by the manufacturer of the detection systems that should have, but didn't, prevent the tragedy.    If defense contractors were to be held financially liable for products that don't work, maybe we would begin to get our defense-procurement money's worth. We might even be able to prevent future Flight 655-type disasters.    Irwin S. Levine   Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.    ---   Mr. Cockburn makes great efforts to suggest that this unfortunate incident is comparable with the Soviet downing of KAL Flight 007. While some of his selected facts may be true, he neglects to mention three stark differences.    Flight 655 was knowingly being operated in a combat region by one of the declared belligerents; KAL 007 was not. The USS Vincennes was under attack by Iranian gunboats in the hours immediately preceding the incident; the Soviet fighters that shot down KAL 007 were not under attack. Most important, the Vincennes fired its missiles at an aircraft that it deemed a hostile threat; the Soviet fighters visually identified KAL 007 as a civilian airliner -- and fired upon it anyway. I fail to see the correlation between these two &quot;parallel&quot; incidents.    Robert L. Stampf Jr.    Sergeant, U.S. Army   Daytona Beach, Fla.</TEXT></DOC>
