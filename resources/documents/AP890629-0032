The Railway Labor Executives Association, speaking for 16 Amtrakunions, accused the federally subsidized railroad of ``courting anational strike'' by trying to cut employee benefits. The picketsalso will protest poor working conditions aboard trains, the unionssaid.   The last wage agreements were signed in 1986 and talks betweenAmtrak and the individual unions are at various stages.   Union leaders say they are being asked to take pay and benefitcuts of up to 20 percent as Amtrak revenue is improving andridership is at record levels.   ``The picketing Friday will be a warning to Congress and thepublic,'' said Ed Wytkind, spokesman for the unions.   An announcement described the planned picket lines and rallies as``an attempt to avoid a nationwide strike against Amtrak.''   The unions said they will protest ``substandard wages, unsafe andunsanitary working conditions, contracting out and outrightunion-busting.''   Amtrak spokeswoman Sue Martin said officials expect the picketingto cause no disruptions in service on the railroad's 24,000 miles ofrails serving 500 communities. She said no workers are expected towalk off the job.   ``I think we're a long way from a strike,'' she said.   Ms. Martin said the company has been negotiating with the unionsseparately for several months, with both sides applying for federalmediation in some of the talks.   She acknowledged that under present contracts, union workers earnan average of about 12 percent less than employees of otherrailroads, but said salaries are ahead of those for similar jobs inother industries.   For example, she said, employees who help passengers with luggagemake $23,000 a year, compared to $12,000 to $16,000 for similar jobsat airports.   Ms. Martin said the company is taking steps to improve safety andsanitary conditions in 35 cars used to accommodate on-trainemployees, including installation of emergency windows in all roomsand overhaul of the cars to meet the same standards as passengercars. Eighteen of the crew cars have so far been refurbished, shesaid.   An employee was killed in a fire aboard a dormitory car last year.   Joel Parker, a spokesman for on-board union employees, saidcompany demands would amount to $100-a-week pay cuts for someworkers.   He said the union objects to the contracting out of reservationswork and could call a strike on that issue.   Ms. Martin confirmed that some reservations work will be handledby outside employees for the peak summer months. However, she saidthat is allowed by union agreements and the outside workers willsupplement union workers, not replace them.   The unions announced rallies in Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif.;Chicago; Boston; Newark, N.J.; Philadelphia; Baltimore; andWilmington, Del. It also said picket lines will be set up atstations in Seattle; Denver; Atlanta; Indianapolis; New Orleans;Lorton and Richmond, Va.; New York City; Albany, N.Y.; Canton, Ohio;Pittsburgh and Altoona, Pa.; Washington D.C., and Sanford, Tampa,Jacksonville and Miami, Fla.</TEXT></DOC>
