Flickinger, assistant attorney general foradministration.andM;Before the directive came down, several non-litigating offices in theImmigration and Naturalization Service, FBI and Bureau of Prisons had orderedabout 1,000 Eagle microcomputers.andP;  By last September, a total of about 7,500micros had been ordered from the 1989 contract with Tisoft Inc. of Fairfax,Va., said Andrew J. Boots, director of the Project Eagle Office.andM;Justice can purchase up to 12,000 micros through the contract, in addition toconnecting the 4,000 machines already owned by participating agencies.andM;&quot;When you add it all up, I wouldn't be at all surprised if we end up with15,000 Eagle users,&quot; Boots said.andM;Eagle's biggest group of users are the 9,000 employees of U.S.andP;  attorneys'district offices.andP;  Eagle is up and running in the Executive Office for U.S.andO;Attorneys in Washington and in 35 of the 93 district offices.andM;Installation essentially is complete in the Tax Division and CriminalDivision as well.andM;But because of a mushrooming caseload from the war on drugs and the savingsand loan fraud investigations, the Criminal Division may put as many as 100new employees on Eagle, Boots said.andM;Smaller organizations taking part in the project are the Justice ManagementDivision, Office of Policy Development, Office of ProfessionalResponsibility, Office of the Solicitor General, U.S.andP;  Marshals Service andCourt Security Office.andM;The typical Eagle micro is a 386 or 386SX from Wyse Technology of San Jose,Calif., with a minimum of 1M RAM, 40M hard drive and VGA or monochromemonitor.andP;  The micros have TCP/IP networking software, proprietary menumanagement, and software for file transfer and terminal emulation.andM;The eight-year, $76 million contract with Tisoft originally called for 286machines, and some of those were installed.andP;  But today the least powerfulmicro being installed is a 386SX, Boots said.andM;Besides interoperability, Eagle will make possible the fail-safe backup ofdocuments -- critically important to attorneys with court deadlines to meet.andM;&quot;The old line, 'I'm sorry, your honor, I can't file this brief on timebecause my computer went down' is today's equivalent of 'The dog ate myhomework,'&quot; Boots said.andM;Eagle's Data General Corp. MV/15000 minicomputers act as application serversand file servers to create mirror images of all documents written on theEagle micros.andM;The minis have 256 virtual ports and run Data General's AOS/VS II operatingsystem.andM;&quot;If you have a PC hard-disk crash, just move to another PC and your work isstill there on the minicomputer and you can keep working,&quot; Boots said.andP;  Ifthe mini goes down, an Eagle user can continue with micro-based applications.andM;WordPerfect Corp.'s WordPerfect Office runs on the mini servers, providingelectronic mail, calendar and scheduling.andP;  The servers also host OracleCorp.'s relational database management system as well as DMCS, a powerfulDBMS for full text retrieval, from Williams Automated Management Systems Inc.andO;of Santa Fe Springs, Calif.andM;The Ethernet local area networks follow TCP/IP protocols.andP;  LANs within theWashington metropolitan area combine to form a common resources LAN, or CORELAN, that allows users to send electronic mail and documents over high-speedlines.andM;Through a gateway into the FTS 2000 network, users on the Eagle CORE LAN cantransmit e-mail and documents nationwide to users of Amicus, a smaller andolder Justice automation system.andM;This year, 56 sites in the Washington metropolitan area network will belinked to Eagle sites across the country by the FTS 2000 packet-switchednetwork for e-mail and document interchange.andM;The Project Eagle Office also is working with US Sprint Communications Co. totie together cities within U.S.andP;  attorneys' districts.andP;  For example, theWestern District of Texas has a San Antonio headquarters.andP;  Suboffices inAustin and El Paso have their own minis that will be linked by FTS 2000because, Boots said, &quot;It's not cost effective to string cables between thosecities.&quot;andM;Amicus, which serves the Civil Division and other litigating organizationsnot covered by Eagle, does word processing on minis, in contrast with Eagle,where word processing is on micros.andM;&quot;The Amicus program office is working to extend the life of Amicus by findingways to run WordPerfect on PCs and take some of the load off themini-computers,&quot; Boots said.andM;Most Amicus workstations are dumb terminals, which some organizations havereplaced with PCs.andP;  However, Boots pointed out that dumb terminals have theadvantage of being more secure &quot;because no one's particularly interested instealing them and taking them home.&quot;andM;Although plans call for Eagle eventually to replace Amicus, Boots said, &quot;Thereal question now is funding.andP;  Are we able to afford that or will Amicusorganizations need to buy their own Amicus III or Eagle II, or some newname?&quot;andM;The fiscal 1991 budget cut did not paralyze Eagle, he said, because it wasnot intended &quot;to discourage any of the organizations from spending their ownmoney, and in fact the organizations affected actually had all that moneyrestored back to their operating budgets.&quot;andM;Congress appropriated $16.9 million of the $23 million requested for Eagle inthe president's fiscal 1991 budget.andP;  The fiscal 1992 presidential budget asksfor $35.2 million for Eagle, the amount Justice had requested.andM;Boots said the growth of $18.3 million between 1991's appropriation and1992's request reflects the immense task his office faces this year to putthe system into larger offices.andM;Justice is acquiring the equipment through a 36-month lease-to-ownarrangement.andP;  Because final equipment will be installed late this fiscalyear, payments for equipping the larger offices will come in fiscal 1992.andO;Eagle appropriations should begin tailing off after 1992.andM;So far, Eagle has landed mostly in smaller U.S.andP;  attorneys' offices withobsolete equipment.andP;  Those offices have experienced the greatesttechnological jolt.andP;  &quot;They only recently got their first PCs, and now theyhave networks and printers.andP;  Holy moly, Batman,&quot; Boots said.andM;The Eagle office has three goals for 1991.andP;  By September, it will completeinstallations at all U.S.andP;  attorneys' offices, including larger offices inNew York, Los Angeles and Chicago.andP;  It will establish nationwide e-mail.andO;While doing all that, it will try to maintain technological currency.andM;&quot;We want to make sure we don't end up with 1989 or 1990 technology that isgoing to be really obsolete&quot; when the contract expires in 1997, he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
