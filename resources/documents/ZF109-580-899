St. Paul, MN 55120andM;[Un]real-timeandM;Dear UNIX REVIEW,andM;I was very disappointed by two of the real-time articles in your Septemberissue.andP;  Clement Cole and Douglass Locke may be expert technicians but theirnarrow view of the real-time market is neither current nor up to thestandards of UNIX REVIEW.andP;  Your readers have been badly mislead.andM;Mr.andP;  Cole listed features from several pseudo real-time UNIX offerings and awish list of seven desirable attributes real-time UNIX should have, but whichare not available from any single source.andP;  The list included multitasking,communications channels, data pooling, memory management, processsynchronization with external events, and predictable real-time response.andO;Actually, two companies provide real-time, ATandamp;T-based UNIX with thesefeatures and a deterministic, fully-preemptable kernel.andM;VenturCom Inc.andP;  (Cambridge, MA) developed VENIX/386 which meets all sevenpoints on Mr. Cole's list and is the only real-time, true UNIX to operate onthe ISA bus.andP;  Major corporations like GE, Toshiba, and Foxboro have usedVENIX for years and continue to expand their applications for this extremelyfunctional and flexible operating system.andM;Similarly, Modcomp (Fort Lauderdale, FL) has a fully-preemptable real-timeUNIX operating system which they market on their proprietary hardware.andM;How have Clement Cole and Douglass Locke overlooked this current technologyand the two leaders in acquisition and control as well?andP;  I don't know, butthank goodness most of the UNIX community is better informed.andM;Kim Carpenter VenturCom Cambridge, MAandM;The Holy CandM;Dear UNIX REVIEW,andM;Nice article on ANSI C (&quot;C Advisor&quot; Vol.andP;  8 No.andP;  7).andP;  Unfortunately, KenArnold blew it when he said ANSI adopted System V's include-file searchrules.andP;  In fact, ANSI specifically leaves the search rulesimplementation-defined since existing file systems differ radically and therereally isn't any way to specify the search rules without knowing thestructure of the underlying filesystem.andM;The committee's original intent was to endorse the search rules fromKandamp;R--andless;...andgt; looks in the standard places starting with those added on thecommand line, &quot;...&quot; looks in the current directory (not the directory wherethe current input file was found), then looks in the standard places.andP;  Thisis still referred to in the Rationale, but it has been completely excisedfrom the standard itself for the above reasons.andM;Other than that, as I said, it was a good article.andM;Larry Jones SDRC 2000 Eastman Dr. Milford, OH 45150-2789andM;Dear UNIX REVIEW,andM;I hope you haven't been inundated with possible explanantions of the &quot;PaintedBlue&quot; macro expansion in &quot;C Advisor&quot; Vol.andP;  8 No.andP;  7, but here's one: in videoand film processing, it is very common to use a blue backdrop for a shot whenthe desired background cannot be used (say, if you want to film Tie Fightersflying against a background of stars and Star Destroyers).andP;  The blue doesn'tleave much of an impression on the film/video, so the desired background canbe merged with the foreground later (in video, you use two feeds, while infilm, you use two pieces of film, one superimposed on the other).andM;So a &quot;painted blue&quot; macro is one that just &quot;doesn't show up&quot; in future macroexpansions.andM;By the bye, the articles on ANSI C (&quot;C Advisor&quot; Vol.andP;  8 Nos.andP;  7, 9, andamp; 11) arequite good (I'd been using an ANSI compliant compiler for several monthswhile with my last employer, and I liked it a lot--though the developersworking on a non-ANSI platform got really tired of seeing me coming to tellthat their code wouldn't compile on the ANSI platform [OS/2 and S/370respectively]).andM;Peter W. Bell Northern Research.andM;Dear UNIX REVIEW,andM;I read with amusement the first of Ken Arnold's series on ANSI C (&quot;C Advisor&quot;Vol.andP;  8 No.andP;  7).andP;  Bravo!andP;  Although you are fighting a rearguard actionagainst a declared victor, I wholeheartedly applaud Ken's efforts.andP;  My ownfeelings towards the X3J11 effort changed from optimism to despair as theyears dragged by.andP;  Often I felt moved to comment about one stupidity oranother but my self doubt in the face of the heavy-weights on the committeeensured my silence.andM;It is somehow gratifying to have one's feelings reinforced by someone ofnote.andP;  For that, I thank you.andM;On a more general note (yes, this probably constitutes fan mail :-), I enjoy&quot;C Advisor&quot; and look forward to its arrival each month.andP;  Keep the real&quot;standard&quot; flying!andM;Camerone PaineandM;Dear UNIX REVIEW,andM;In &quot;C Advisor&quot; Vol.andP;  8 No.andP;  7, you wondered why the X3J11 committee chose#elif, instead of #elseif.andP;  The reason was one of the modern vintage System Vreleases (probably V.3, possibly V.2) used #elif for the else-if construct.andO;You would have to ask ATandamp;T why it did it that way.andM;Also, in terms of searching for include files, what directories (if any) aresearched are completely implementation dependent.andP;  This means the paragraphon finding stdio.h in the same directory where base_types.h is wrong.andM;Kandamp;R version 1 quite clearly specifies that identifiers within strings insideof macros are not expanded.andP;  This is one of three cases where the firstimplementation and the documentation disagreed.andP;  The second is the fact thatKandamp;R specifies a strict ref/def memory model, while the UNIX implementationuses a relaxed ref/def memory model.andP;  The third case is an error in the Kandamp;R-1grammar that would not allow functions that have arguments and return apointer to a function to be declared properly.andM;While it's a kludge, spaces in front a # directive can be useful for dealingwith non-ANSI compilers (that do not recognize preprocessor directives unlessthe # is in column 1): For example:andM;#if defined(BSD) /*...*/ #else #error &quot;Not BSD&quot; #endifandM;Non-ANSI preprocessors would tend to choke if it encountered #error, even insections of code that is #ifdef'ed out.andM;Michael Meissner Open Software FoundationandM;Dear UNIX REVIEW,andM;ANSI is not spoken fluently here (by me, at least), but can't one use &quot;x&quot;[0]instead of 'x' to achieve the desired effect?andP;  Something likeandM;CTRL(x) (#x[0] andamp; Ox1f)andM;if I read your (very nice) article correctly.andM;For what it's worth, I think I may be responsible for the stringconcatenation feature.andP;  I was compiling awk on a machine without floatingpoint, and simply changed the typedef of awkfloat from float to long.andP;  Itcompiled flawless, and (almost) ran, but first I had to go find all the %gformat items, and turn them into %ld.andP;  That made me want a way ofparameterizing format items as well as types, and string concatentation cameto mind.andP;  I sent the suggestion to the C standards folks at Summit, and waslater told it had been proposed as part of ANSI C.andM;John P.
