 The exhibitors obviously thought the trip to the NEC was worth theeffort, with a number stressing that it was the only show where networkingtakes centre stage.andP;  Some saw the show as easily the most important in thecalendar, particulary with respect to business-to-business selling, but anumber of observers point to an overall lull in computer exhibitions thatundermined US trade shows in the early 1980s.andP;  It was apparent that many hadstands simply to ensure that malicious industry gossip wasn't directed atthem, although the likes of DEC, which pulled out of the show at the lastminute, clearly thought otherwise.andP;  The organisers expect around 10,000people to attend this year's show, DP systems computer management and networkmanagers each accounting for around a quarter of visitors, a number of whomdid hold influence in the purchase of networking equipment.andP;  Others liked thethought of a &quot;day out of the office&quot; and, of course, the National Centre'shighly competitive bar prices.andM;Case has new kit but sits Networks outandM;One company increasingly doubtful of Networks' value is DowtyandM;Group's Case Communications, which chose to make a number of announcements onthe eve of Networks, rather than attend the  exhibition.andP;  Case's 6000 Serieslocal area networking system now includes the 6350 Oslan gateway and Macconnection; the ICL gateway allows up to 32 simultaneous sessions into Oslanhosts, while Case's Macintosh facility enables Macs to access Series 6000local area networks.andP;  With Case's 6540 and 6541 Ethernet cards, Macs canconnect to the Series 6000 at 10Mbps.andP;  The company is confident thatconnection to ICL hardware will allow it to tap new markets, particularly inthe public sector.andP;  And as from October the company's Series 6000 willsupport file transfer from PS/2s to ICL hosts.andP;  Another significant strategicmove will see the company release Token Ring products, including a productfor LAN Manager, by the end of the year.andP;  The company will also announce afacsimile switch and new modems later before the year is out and, furtherafield, high speed backbone local networks at 100Mbps and above, broadbandtechnology products, and X400 and electronic data interchange facilities.andO;Looking to triple international revenue to around #100m by 1992/3, thecompany says it is now ready for expansion in continental Europe and will setup operating companies in West German and Spain this year; the Pacific Rim isalso high on the agenda, in particular a Japanese subsidiary.andP;  Integration oflocal and wide area networks will now be central to Case's networkingstrategies.andP;  The company says it is responding to two networking trends thatit feels will result in de facto standards in coming years; these are FDDI100Mbps backbones, as the result of pressure from the computer industry, andmetropolitan area networks as demanded by data communications users.andP;  Casealso announced a contract worth #4m over five years from the Scottish HealthService for the construction of a private packet switched data networklinking the country's Health Boards.andP;  An initial installation in Tayside andForth Valley is based on the Series 8000 X25 kit.andM;Pirelli Focom targets 100Mbps FDDIandM;Pirelli Focom Ltd of Leeds, West Yorkshire announced a range ofandM;new products at the NEC, the most significant marking a move into FibreDistributed Data Interface, FDDI; the company has a range of bridges, Suminet3500, manufactured by Japan's Sumitomo Corp, for connecting local nets onto a100Mbps fibre backbone networks.andP;  Pirelli Focom says it is the only companyto offer the bridges in Europe, and will follow them with more FDDI products.andO;The new releases, available next quarter, are #15,000 each: users need twofor connection.andP;  Pirelli Focom's other new products are a line of multiporttransceivers; twisted pair repeaters for 802.3 Ethernet networks; a16-channel fibre optic multiplexer; and a structured wiring system.andM;And some of the best of the restandM;Retix Systems Ltd unveiled RetixMail X400 electronic mail, whichandM;includes connection for Unix users, and file transfer, access and management,FTAM, products, including server and client software for Unix, and MS-DOSclient software.andP;  The X400 OpenServer message handling product for Unix alsoincludes an application programming interface.andP;  Meanwhile, at GEC PlesseyTelecommunications Data Systems Unit's stand, the company's new modems werenever likely to overshadow the uncertainty hanging over the company as aresult of the less than harmonious relations between its two parents.andO;Newbury, Berkshire-based Able Computer Communications Ltd used Networks '89to launch the Advance/16 Ethernet server, claiming it to be the first 16 portEthernet server to support LAT and TCP/IP  protocols  simultaneously.andP;  Eachof the 16 devices can establish up to four active TCP/IP or LAT sessions,while Ethernet connections can support DEC, IBM and Unix users.andP;  Over atBritish Telecommunications Plc's giant two-tier stand, the company announcedan improved managed data network service, PSS Plus, to be used on newlycreated capacity on the company's public data network, PSS.andP;  British Telecom,which says it will spend #21.5m installing more packet-switching capacity,will operate a flat annual sum on the network: annual rentals are #2,600,#4,200 and #12,000 per line for data rates of 2,400, 9,600 and 48,000bpsrespectively.andP;  A relatively small number of overseas firms made their way toBirmingham for Networks '89, although Alcatel Businss Systems Ltd used theopportunity to launch its 8940 processor, which allows IBM mainframes tocommunicate with TCP/IP networks.andP;  Alcatel is also promising IBM-to-OpenSystems connections in &quot;a few months&quot;.andP;  The 8490, developed jointly withIntel, provides file and mail transfer and virtual terminal functions, andAlcatel provides software that allows DEC terminals to access IBM 3270applications.andP;  Other highlights included Madge Networks Ltd, with two newSmart Ring Nodes for Token Ring networks; Hoskyns' appointment as a valueadded  reseller for Banyan Systems Inc's Vines Virtual Networking System; andNetwork Designers Ltd with an X400 electronic mail system for personalcomputer local area network users, through an OEM deal with Net-Tel ComputerSystems.andP;  - Andy Evagora</TEXT></DOC>
