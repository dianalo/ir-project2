But despite this advantage the condensingboiler has been slow to penetrate markets in the UK. In an effort topromote this technology the Energy Efficiency Office is sponsoring aprogramme of demonstrations. The main aim of the programme is to showthat condensing boilers are straightforward to install, do not lead toproblems in maintenance, are cost effective and therefore an attractiveenergy efficiency investment. Some technical aspects of the boiler areoutlined and two local council schemes demonstrating its cost effectivenessin new housing are described.</TEXT></DOC>
