(All four Respondents will hereinafterbe referred to collectively as ``Respondent Josberg,'' unless otherwiseindicated.) The charging letter was issued under the authority of the ExportAdministration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401-2420) (``theAct''), and the Export Administration Regulations (``the Regulations'').\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Act was reauthorized and amended by the Export AdministrationAmendments Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-64, 99 Stat. 120 (July 12, 1985), andamended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-418,102 Stat. 1107 (August 23, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28">The Regulations, formerly codified at 15 CFR Parts 368-399, were redesignatedas 15 CFR Parts 768-799, effective October 1, 1988 (53 FR 37751, September28, 1988).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">The charging letter alleged that Respondent Josberg violated the Regulationsfrom April 1983 through December 1985. As the charging letter noted (at1 n.1), twice during this period the Regulations were maintained in effect,not pursuant to the Act, which had lapsed, but pursuant to the InternationalEmergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706 (1982)).</ITAG>The charging letter alleged that Respondent Josberg violated the Regulationsthrough three separate transactions or series of transactions from 1983through 1985. First, the charging letter alleged that Respondent Josbergviolated andSection;andSection; 387.3, 387.4, and 387.6 by conspiring withothers to export an airstream modulator from the United States throughWestern Europe to the Soviet Union without the required U.S. authorization.Second, the charging letter alleged that Respondent Josberg violated andSection;andSection;387.4 and 387.6 by making eleven exports of U.S.-origin computers and peripheralsfrom Sweden to the Soviet Union without the required U.S. authorization.Third, the charging letter alleged that Respondent Josberg violated andSection;andSection;387.3, 387.4, and 387.6 by conspiring with others to acquire a U.S.-origincomputer in Sweden and to export it to the Soviet Union without the requiredU.S. authorization. Respondent Josberg filed a June 1, 1988 answer claiming that the firsttwo transactions or series of transactions had been approved by Swedishauthorities, essentially denying any participation in the third transaction,and suggesting that a hearing on all three be held in Sweden. That suggestionfor a hearing in Sweden was declined by this Tribunal in an Order of June10, 1988; and, pursuant to the schedule set in that Order, this case isdecided on the record without a hearing. The record contains submissionsfrom both the Agency and Respondent Josberg since that June 10, 1988 Order.Finally, it may be noted that this case is one of several separate proceedingsinitiated by the Agency, each brought against one of the several individualswith whom Respondent Josberg is alleged in this case to have conspired.\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ One of these cases has been already concluded: <T3>Anton Elzer,</T3> 53 FR 28676, July 29, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>Of the three transactions or series of transactions that are the subjectof the Agency's charges, it is the second for which the Agency has suppliedthe most direct evidence (Agency Exhibits (hereinafter ``Exh.'') II-1 throughII-12). Here the Agency charged that Respondent Josberg, from June 1983through April 1985, on eleven separate occasions shipped U.S.-origin computersand peripherals from Sweden to the Soviet Union without the U.S. authorizationthat Respondent Josberg knew or should have known was required. In the Agency's words, its evidence for these eleven transactions is asfollows (Agency September 1, 1988 Submission 16-17). The transactions are summarized on invoices with Josberg's Globe Metalor Globe Computer letterhead. Sales contracts corroborate the transactionsdescribed by the invoices. The sales contracts are on Soviet letterhead,and each one clearly describes the shipper to be one of the Globe companies,all related to Josberg, with delivery to be either to Prommashimport orElectronorgtechnica in Moscow. For some shipments, there are ``acceptanceand delivery protocols'' indicating the ``seller'' to be Globe Metals orGlobe Computers. In other exhibits, there are credit advices, showing thepaying bank as ``Bank for Foreign Trade of the U.S.S.R., Moskva''. In fact, the Agency's evidence does not always track each of the elevenshipments precisely as the Agency has described them.\5\<NOTE/> Also, the Agency's evidence indicates that, had RespondentJosberg applied for U.S. authorization for the eleven shipments, all theequipment contained in them would have benefited from a presumption ofapproval. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ For example, the memoranda in the Agency's Exhibits II-1through II-11 to show the licensing requirement for the shipments do notalways speak to the same month as that in which the Agency claimed thatthe shipment occurred. But these aspects of the Agency's evidence do not undercut its main thrust.The evidence establishes that Respondent Josberg made the eleven shipmentsas alleged, and that each was made without the required U.S. authorization,required mostly for national security reasons. Indeed, Respondent Josbergdid not deny either that the eleven shipments were made as charged, orthat they lacked the required U.S. authorization. Respondent Josberg'sonly defense was that Swedish authorization had been obtained. No evidencewas advanced to support that defense, nor was any explanation offered asto how such Swedish authorization would satisfy the requirement for U.S.authorization. The Agency charged that, since each of the eleven shipments lacked therequired U.S. authorization, Respondent Josberg in making them violatedandSection; 387.6 of the Regulations, which proscribes unauthorized exports.This Agency charge is sustained by a preponderance of the evidence. TheAgency's documentary presentation shows that Respondent Josberg made theunauthorized exports as alleged, and Respondent Josberg's defense of anunsubstantiated reference to a Swedish authorization is unpersuasive. The Agency additionally cited evidence_consisting partly of interviewsof Respondent Goran Josberg, one by a U.S. government official (AgencyExh. III-11, III-13)_to show Respondent Josberg's awareness of U.S. exportlicensing requirements. Consequently, the Agency charged that in makingthese eleven shipments Respondent Josberg violated also andSection; 387.4of the Regulations, which proscribes participating in an export with knowledgethat it is unauthorized. Further, the Agency charged that an Order of December 28, 1983 had temporarilydenied the U.S. export privileges of Respondent Goran Josberg and RespondentGlobe Computers. Thus the Agency asserted that those six of the elevenshipments made after that date violated andSection; 387.4 on the additionalground that Respondent Josberg knew that they were contravening the Orderof December 28, 1983. These Agency charges of violations of andSection; 387.4,on both grounds cited by the Agency, are not refuted by Respondent Josberg'sdefense of an unsubstantiated Swedish authorization, and are sustainedby a preponderance of the evidence. The first of the transactions or series of transactions that were listedas subjects of the Agency's charging letter is the most complex, and willbe discussed last. The third of those three transactions concerned theacquisition of a U.S.-origin computer from a Swedish distributorship andits subsequent export to the Soviet Union, all in November and December1985. The Agency charged that Respondent Josberg masterminded a conspiracyto acquire the computer, partly by misrepresenting the identity of theend user, and to ship it to Moscow. The Agency introduced evidence showing the acquisition of the computerby several individuals other than Respondent Goran Josberg. This evidenceconsisted of commercial documentation of the acquisition (Agency Exh. III-1,III-4, III-5), of the signed statements of two officials of the Swedishdistributorship (Agency Exh. III-2, III-8), and of a certificate signedby that one of the several individuals who played a leading role in acquiringthe computer (Agency Exh. III-7). The Agency further cited this evidence to argue that these several individualshad misrepresented to the Swedish distributorship that one of them wouldbe the end user, when that in fact was not their intention (Agency Exh.III-1, III-2, III-4, III-8). The signed statement of one of the distributorshipofficials asserted that the individual designated as the end user had admittedthat he had not intended to fulfill that role (Agency Exh. III-2); andthe signed statement of the other distributorship officials asserted thatthe individual who played the leading role in the acquisition had saidthat he gave the computer to Respondent Goran Josberg and Respondent GlobeTrading (Agency Exh. III-8). For the Agency's claim that the computer was shipped to the Soviet Union,the Agency presented an air waybill for data equipment (Agency Exh. III-6),and cited circumstantial evidence involving the date of this shipment andits Moscow destination (Agency September 1, 1988 Submission 20-21). Totie Respondent Josberg to the acquisition of the computer from the Swedishdistributorship and its shipment to Moscow, the Agency cited principallytwo documents. The first was the signed statement of one of the distributorshipofficials in which he said that the individual who played the leading rolein acquiring the computer had declared that Respondent Goran Josberg wasfinishing the acquisition (Agency Exh. III-8). The second was the certificatesigned by that individual in which he said that he gave the computer toRespondent Goran Josberg and Respondent Globe Computer (Agency Exh. III-7).Finally, the Agency introduced evidence to show that the shipment of thecomputer from Sweden to the Soviet Union lacked the required U.S. authorization,and that this requirement was imposed for national security reasons (AgencyExh. III-9, III-9A). As evidence that Respondent Josberg was aware of theunauthorized nature of the shipment, the Agency cited, among other items,the evidence adduced above regarding the eleven computer shipments forRespondent Josberg's awareness of U.S. licensing requirements. The Agencycited also the Order of December 28, 1983 denying U.S. export privilegesto Respondent Goran Josberg and Respondent Globe Trade. In conclusion, the Agency contended that Respondent Josberg's actions violatedthree sections of the Regulations. According to the Agency, participatingin the conspiracy to arrange the unauthorized export to the Soviet Unionviolated andSection; 387.3, participating in the export with knowledge thatit was illegal violated andSection; 387.4, and participating in an unauthorizedexport violated andSection; 387.6. The reply of Respondent Josberg to these charges was a denial. RespondentJosberg denied any knowledge of the individual who had been representedto be the end user in the acquisition of the computer, denied conductingthe alleged transaction with the individual who played the leading rolein that acquisition, and claimed that Respondent Globe Trade had been soldat the end of 1985 to that individual. Respondent Josberg offered no evidenceto support these denials and the claim. On balance, the preponderance of the evidence sustains the Agency's charges.The Agency's documentary presentation shows an unauthorized shipment ofa U.S.-origin computer from Sweden to the Soviet Union, and satisfactorilyties Respondent Josberg to this transaction through the statements of theindividual who played the leading role in acquiring the computer from theSwedish distributorship. Respondent Josberg's rebuttal unsupported by evidenceis insufficient to discredit the Agency's case. Respondent Josberg's denialof knowing the individual who has been represented to be the end user inthe computer acquisition, for example, even if true, would not refute theAgency's case. Respondent Josberg was still shown by the record to havehad enough connection with the other individual who was involved in thatacquisition, enough connection with the shipment from Sweden to the SovietUnion, and enough awareness of U.S. licensing requirements to have violatedandSection;andSection; 387.3, 387.4, and 387.6 of the Regulations.The last for discussion of the transactions or series of transactions thatwere the subject of the Agency's charging letter was the first listed,and the most complex. The Agency alleged that in 1983-84 Respondent Josbergmasterminded a conspiracy to buy an airstream modulator in the United States,on the representation that the Federal Republic of Germany (F.R.G.) wouldbe the ultimate destination, and then to export it to the Soviet Unionwithout the required authorization. As evidence, the Agency cited a letter to this Tribunal from one of thetwo alleged co-conspirators, Anton Elzer, of Sweden, who did business thereas Development and Consultant Elzer ECO AB (Agency Exh. I-7). In this letter,Elzer said that he initially canceled the project to obtain the airstreammodulator when both he and Respondent Goran Josberg declined to sign theend user statement that was required for a U.S. export license (<T3>id.</T3> 2). Subsequently, according to this letter, they arrangedto obtain the equipment through Helmut Keck, of the F.R.G., who did businessthere as OTC Mess-Und Videotechnik GmbH (<T3>id.</T3>). Keck was the third of the Agency's alleged co-conspirators.Keck ordered the airstream modulator from the U.S. manufacturer and submittedan F.R.G. import certificate in support of the order, as shown by the exportlicense application filed by the manufacturer (Agency Exh. I-27). The exportlicense was issued for the export to the F.R.G., listing Keck's companyas the end user; and the equipment was shipped from the United States tothe F.R.G. on or about October 12, 1984 (<T3>id.</T3>)The Agency's contention was that this airstream modulator was really intended,not for Keck's company in the F.R.G., but for Respondent Josberg and reshipmentto the Soviet Union. To prove this contention, the Agency cited a statementin the above letter to this Tribunal from Elzer declaring that RespondentJosberg had ordered the equipment from Allinson Ltd., of Singapore, withwhich Elzer was connected (Agency Exh. I-13, I-17). The Agency then cited a commercial document (Agency Exh. I-26) indicatingthat Allinson Ltd. ordered the equipment from Keck in April 1984; and Keckconfirmed the order in mid-May 1984, even before Keck ordered the equipmentfrom the U.S. manufacturer at the end of May 1984, supporting that orderwith the F.R.G. import certificate (Agency Exh. I-27). Allinson Ltd., accordingto the Agency's evidence (Agency Exh. I-17), was a small operation locatedin Singapore and Hong Kong. It was, per that evidence (<T3>id.</T3>), apparently controlled significantly by Elzer, representedonly the firms of Respondent Goran Josberg and Keck, and did all of itsbusiness in cash.The Agency cited the above referenced commercial document to show alsothat Keck's company delivered the airstream modulator to Allinson Ltd.on or about October 25, 1984 (Agency Exh. I-26). The equipment itself apparentlytraveled directly from the United States to the F.R.G. When the equipmentarrived in the F.R.G., Elzer and Keck arranged, according to a commercialdocument (Agency Exh. I-25) and the above referenced letter to this Tribunalfrom Elzer (Agency Exh. I-7 at 2), for it to be transferred to a freightforwarder in Finland. The letter stated that these arrangements were madeat the direction of Respondent Goran Josberg, who had placed the originalorder for the equipment with Allinson Ltd. (<T3>id.</T3>). The Agency asserted that the airstream modulator was next shipped fromFinland to Moscow on October 26, 1984. To support this assertion, the Agencyintroduced a Helsinki-Moscow air waybill for that date for a shipment of``electricals'' listing Elzer as the shipper and Respondent Globe Metalsas the consignee (Agency Exh. I-28). To prove that the ``electricals''were really the airstream modulator, the Agency further noted the evidencethat the modulator, after its arrival in the F.R.G., had been moved rapidlyto Finland at Respondent Josberg's direction, and that Respondent GoranJosberg had been the original customer for the equipment. Finally, the Agency introduced evidence that export of the airstream modulatorwas controlled for national security reasons, and that a presumption ofdenial existed for a license application to export it to the Soviet Union(Agency Exh. I-10). The Agency noted also that the Order of December 28,1983 denied Respondent Josberg's U.S. export privileges throughout allof 1984 when this export of the airstream modulator occurred, and citedthe same evidence as in the other transactions addressed by the chargingletter for Respondent Josberg's knowledge of U.S. export licensing requirements.The Agency observed additionally that Elzer has been found by this Tribunalto have violated the Regulations for his role in exporting the airstreammodulator (<T3>Anton Elzer</T3>, 53 FR 28676, July 29, 1988). The Agency charged that Respondent Josberg violated three sections of theRegulations in the export of the airstream modulator to the Soviet Union.According to the Agency, Respondent Josberg conspired to violate the Regulationsin contravention of andSection; 387.3, participated in this export with knowledgethat it was unauthorized in contravention of Section 387.4, and participatedin an unauthorized export in contravention of andSection; 387.6.In defense, Respondent Josberg denied any knowledge of Keck, noted thata U.S. export license had been issued, and asserted that Swedish authoritieshad advised that the transaction was legal. No evidence was supplied regardingthe claimed Swedish advice, nor was any explanation offered as to how thereexport to the Soviet Union would be authorized either by such adviceor by the U.S. license for an export to the F.R.G.Respondent Josberg's defense fails to rebut the Agency's case. The claimedadvice from Swedish authorities, unsupported by evidence or explanation,does not constitute an adequate rebuttal. Even if Respondent Josberg'sclaimed ignorance of Keck were true, the Agency's charges are sufficientlydocumented by the evidence tying Respondent Josberg to Elzer and to theunauthorized export to the Soviet Union, and showing Respondent Elzer'sawareness of U.S. licensing restrictions. Thus the Agency has made itscase by a preponderance of the evidence.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>The Agency's charges regarding each of the three transactions or seriesof transactions cited in the charging letter are sustained by the evidenceof record. Respondent Josberg's participation in the 1983-84 export ofthe airstream modulator from the United States through the F.R.G. and Finlandto the Soviet Union violated andSection;andSection; 387.3, 387.4, and 387.6of the Regulations. Respondent Josberg's eleven shipments from June 1983through April 1985 of U.S. -origin computers and peripherals from Swedento the Soviet Union violated Sections 387.4 and 387.6 of the Regulations.Respondent Josberg's participation in the 1985 export of a U.S. -origincomputer from Sweden to the Soviet Union violated andSection;andSection; 387.3,387.4, and 387.6 of the Regulations.For Respondent Josberg's violations, the Agency has proposed a 35-yeardenial of U.S. export privileges. The magnitude of Respondent Josberg'sviolations is such that a denial period of that substantial length is warranted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Order</ITAG>I.
