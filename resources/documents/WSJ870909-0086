Reps. Thomas Downey, James Moody and Bob Carr yesterday reported back to Secretary of State Pro Tem Jim Wright their conclusion that the massive installation is indeed not violating the treaty, because it hasn't been turned on. But the congressmen's compasses showed it facing northeast. They weren't sure its ultimate purpose is benign.    Soviet &quot;openness&quot; seems to have failed, but it was a nice try. The Senate today will resume its battle over interpretation of the ABM treaty and the future of strategic defense testing. It will do so at a time when the White House is caught in a contradiction on arms control.    Republicans led by Senator Jesse Helms are filibustering the 1988 defense authorization bill because of an amendment by Senators Sam Nunn and Carl Levin to ban SDI testing in space without congressional approval. Now Mr. Nunn has raised the ante, threatening to delay Senate consideration of any treaty on Euromissiles unless President Reagan agrees to abide by the so-called &quot;narrow&quot; interpretation of the ABM Treaty and halts SDI testing outside the laboratory.    Yet the debate about the &quot;narrow&quot; vs. &quot;broad&quot; interpretations of the ABM Treaty is largely meaningless. The Soviet Union isn't abiding by the treaty however you interpret it.    In his latest report to Congress on Soviet treaty violations, President Reagan noted his &quot;deep, continuing concerns about Soviet noncompliance with the ABM Treaty.&quot; He cited six major Soviet violations of the accord, averring that the Krasnoyarsk radar is clearly designed for ICBM detection and tracking. The radar is not located on the periphery of the U.S.S.R. and pointed outward, as required by the treaty. It is some 750 kilometers from the nearest border, Mongolia, and is oriented not toward that border but across about 4,000 kilometers of Soviet territory toward the northeast. That's hardly the way it would face if it were what the Soviets claim, a satellite-tracking station.    In recent months, more evidence has come to light about a Soviet ABM breakout. The nine Pechora-Krasnoyarsk-class radars so far discovered in the Soviet Union are located near ICBM fields. They overlap to form an interconnected network capable of using ABM interceptors to destroy incoming warheads. The locations of the three most recently sighted radars at Skrunda, Baranovichi and Mukachevo are within 1,300 kilometers of Moscow and 1,300 kilometers of each other. Their proximity violates the ABM Treaty too.    Several types of Soviet mobile ABM system components may also be illegally deployed in the western Soviet Union near three new battle-management radar sites. These mobile ABM components are believed to be in mass production. The Flat Twin and Pawn Shop mobile ABM radars have disappeared from the Sary Shagan ABM test range. It's likely that they are now being incorporated into the larger network.    The ABM treaty permits the Soviets one anti-missile system to defend a 300-kilometer circle around Moscow. This limit was imposed to ensure that a single ABM site doesn't protect both a nation's capital and more distant ICBM silos. But the new Moscow ABM system now being deployed to replace the old Galosh system first built in 1964 has a far longer protective radius. Both the modern radars and the ABM interceptors -- SAM-5s, 10s, and 12s -- could protect Moscow as well as neighboring missile silos and new mobile ICBMs such as the SS-24s and SS-25s.    President Reagan is required to submit a new Soviet noncompliance report to Congress Dec. 1. That could provide additional details of the Kremlin's efforts to develop both regional and nationwide missile defenses. In the meantime, he may be forced to veto the defense authorization bill if it includes language banning SDI testing in space and other prohibitions.    The president could then find himself in an awkward position. If the current INF talks on Euromissiles are successful, Mr. Reagan would have to somehow satisfy Senator Nunn's demands on ABM testing in order to avert a lengthy delay in Senate ratification. At the same time, the president will be citing the Soviet Union for a continued and expanding pattern of arms-control violations, especially the ABM accord.    The current ABM fight, therefore, goes back to the fundamental question: How can you sign a new arms treaty with the Soviet Union when it continues to violate existing ones? </TEXT></DOC>
