Shultz on his last official flight bore the messagestenciled in ice cream: ``Thanks For The Memory.''   Over 6{ years of traveling 880,941 miles with the secretary ofstate to 74 countries, stewards, staff and the regulars in the presscorps came to know him a little bit better than most people.   They will retain memorable experiences of visits to the Kremlin,to the Taj Mahal, the holy city of Jerusalem, the colorful capitalof Soviet Georgia, Tbilisi.   They found him to be a cautious man, but not without emotion. Hemade himself accessible to the media on almost every flight, andbroke precedent by putting his remarks on the record.   They saw Shultz fail to entice Palestinian Arabs intonegotiations with Israel, or even to talk to him. A memorableportrait was Shultz standing alone in a moonlit courtyard in EastJerusalem, waiting in vain for a dozen Palestinians who dared notrisk the disfavor of the Palestine Liberation Organization byaccepting his invitiation.   Shultz was willing to risk being stood up, in public, in theinterest of promoting Mideast peace talks. It was a risk ofembarrassment that not many secretaries of state would have taken.   Shultz made five trips to the Middle East in 1988 alone, eachtime warning Israel and the Arabs that the status quo was dangerous.Each time he was rebuffed, but his spirits were not dampened. ``Ithink there is a lot of possibility there, and to a certain extent,the groundwork is work that we did,'' he said on his last trip, toVienna, last Sunday.   Still, Israel remains besieged in a hostile Arab world, while theWest Bank and Gaza seethe with Palestinian unrest. The proliferationof ballistic missiles in the region and suspicions that Iraq, Libyaand Syria either have or are capable of producing chemical orbiological weapons compound the dangers.   Shultz had other failures, too. The agreement he worked out withLebanon and Israel in 1983 fell apart under Syrian pressure. Heobjected to secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in 1985, but was unableto deter President Reagan and the National Security Council. Somecritics said Shultz did not fight hard enough, especially since themissile deliveries undercut his campaign against terrorism, or thathe should have resigned in protest when he lost out.   His successes outnumbered the setbacks, though.   Despite the Iran-Contra scandal, Shultz managed to carry thebanner against terrorism to new heights, alerting initially bemusedWestern leaders to the danger. And he championed human rights.   Shultz took time on his trips to Moscow to meet with Jews andother dissidents. He attended a Passover Seder in the U.S. embassyand saw to it that leading ``refuseniks'' were invited.   Gradually, under a modern Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev,the doors swung open. Jewish emigration is at a nine-year high. Morethan 600 political prisoners have been released. More than 100divided families have been permitted to reunite.   ``I think the things I feel the best about had to do with thearea of human rights,'' Shultz said on the flight to Vienna. ``Andthe one incident that always sticks with me is the day I had a phonecall from Ida Nudel, saying `I'm home.' I still tingle a little as Ithink about it.''   The long-time Jewish refusenik was issued an exit permit forIsrael under U.S. pressure, and had called Shultz from Jerusalemafter her arrival.   Apart from human rights, his most lasting achievement was torecognize the change in Moscow after Gorbachev's ascent to power inApril 1985 and to play a leading role within the Reaganadministration in responding to Soviet arms control overtures.   Shultz worked out a close relationship with Eduard A.Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister. In 31 meetings, they madearrangements for five superpower summit meetings and worked out waysto reduce regional tensions. The Soviet Red Army is withdrawing fromAfghanistan. Cuban troops are leaving Angola. And the Vietnamese arepulling out of Cambodia.   Shultz's impact on U.S. foreign policy depends partly on how muchthe Bush administration follows the pattern or changes it. James A.Baker III, Shultz's designated successor, voiced reservations at hisSenate confirmation hearing to a human rights conference in Moscowand said negotiations to reduce strategic nuclear weapons would bedelayed ``to review the bidding.''   But, as President-elect Bush himself has said, ``the genie is outof the bottle.'' U.S.-Soviet relations are in a new phase. And forthat, Shultz is as responsible as anyone.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Barry Schweid heads the AP's State Departmentstaff and traveled extensively with the secretary of state.</TEXT></DOC>
