Officially sanctioned rallies were held Tuesday in Estonia,Latvia and Lithuania, according to dispatches by the officialSoviet news agency Tass printed in today's edition of the CommunistParty newspaper Pravda.   Unofficial groups also demonstrated in the three republics,according to reports from the state-controlled media and fromemigre groups.   The decision to allow the demonstrations was part of Kremlinleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign to reform the Soviet Union,but it was combined with sharp rhetoric and police harassmentagainst some human rights activists in the republics.   Two activists were reportedly arrested by plainclothes KGBofficers at an unofficial rally attended by 6,000 people inVilnius, capital of Lithuania, the most rebellious of the Balticrepublics, according to emigre sources.   The activists, Leonas Laurinskas and Genute Sakaliene, raisedthe tri-colored flag of independent Lithuania at the rally. KGBofficers pulled down the flag and held the two activists for a fewhours, according to Lithuanian Catholic Religious Aid, an emigregroup based in New York.   During the official commemoration in Vilnius, attended by 500Lithuanians, ``some extremist-minded people tried to impart to themeeting a demagogic character and channel it to the route ofnationalism,'' Tass said.   In Washington, President Reagan proclamed Tuesday ``BalticFreedom Day,'' and said the United States will never recognize theforcible incorporation of the republics into the Soviet Union.   ``The situation has improved for some Soviet human rightsactivists in recent months,'' the U.S. statement said. ``But Balticmen and women still suffer imprisonment, banishment and persecutionfor daring to protest the continuing suppression of their nationalindependence and cultures.''   Soviet officials reject U.S. condemnation of the annexation,carried out in June 1940 under a secret protocol of theMolotov-Ribbentrop pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.   But as part of Gorbachev's campaign to change the system createdby Kremlin dictator Josef V. Stalin, Soviet officials nowacknowledge that heavy-handed methods were used.   Before Gorbachev came to power, Soviet authorities generallytried to forestall demonstrations in the Baltic republics.   But they allowed demonstrations on June 14, 1987, and last monthin Vilnius sponsored an official commemoration of a massdeportation that took place in 1947. However, they broke up anunofficial demonstration attended by 5,000 people in Vilnius on thesame day and harassed people at an unofficial rally Tuesday.   Tuesday marked the 47th anniversary of the first massdeportation when, Tass said, ``thousands of families were illegallydeported from Estonia by the Stalinist administrative-bureaucraticsystem.'' Memorial meetings were held in Tallin, the Estoniancapital, and Tartus and Piarnu.   Alfred Rudiks, mayor of Riga, capital of Latvia, told anofficial rally there that the government of the republic had``approved the initiative of young people to build in Riga amonument to victim's of Stalin's personality cult.''   Official reports of the mass deportations accused many of thevictims of being Nazi sympathizers, and said that Baltic emigregroups were seeking to undermine Soviet authority.   ``We justifiably condemn the policy of cruelty,'' Tass quotedhistorian Jan Riekstins as telling a demonstration which it saidwas attended by ``many thousands'' of people.   Emigre Lithuanian groups say that 36,000 were deported in 1941and another 200,000 in 1948.   Official Soviet historians say a total of 31,000 Latvians weredeported in 1941, when the Baltic republics were occupied by theRed Army, and in 1949, after the Soviets had defeated the Nazis.   Tass said that, ``apart from those who were deservedly punishedfor acts of political sabotage, collaboration with fascists,banditism and espionage, the deportees also included innocentpeople.''   Tass also had harsh words for a Latvian human rights activistwho organized an unofficial demonstration there, Edmund Cirvilis,whom it called ``a former Nazi soldier who was sent to Latvia on aterrorist mission in 1945.''   Repeated efforts to telephone activists in the Baltic republicswere unsuccessful.   Last month, Soviet police broke up a demonstration by 5,000Lithuanians marking the anniversary of the 1949 deportations,according to Lithuanian activists.</TEXT></DOC>
