Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the Iranian oil minister, told reportersSaudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates ``reservedtheir position'' until OPEC's next meeting, which he said was setfor Saturday night.   Iraq, which has not joined OPEC's existing production-sharingsystem, was not expected to particiopate in the proposed new cuts,said Venezuelan Oil Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti.   Hernandez said the proposal was made by Algeria.   ``This proposal had the support of eight countries,'' he said.   The four gulf Arab oil ministers were to consult with theirgovernments and report a final decision at the next session,Hernandez told reporters.   The production cuts would take effect May 1.   It was not immediately clear how the proposed cut of 300,000barrels a day, if adopted, would be divided among the 13 members ofthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   The proposal calls for oil export cuts by OPEC in conjunctionwith a group of independent oil producers. The non-OPEC group wasinvited to discuss strategy at OPEC headquarters in Vienna earlierthis week.   The aim is to raise prices to OPEC's target of $18 a barrel,from the current range of $14 to $16, by tightening supplies.   Nervous traders sent oil prices lower on European markets, whereBrent crude oil from the North Sea tumbled 66 cents, to $16.54 a42-gallon barrel, after having lost 30 cents on Thursday.   Later, prices continued slumping at the New York MercantileExchange, dropping as much as 43 cents per barrel before rallyingtoward the close and ending largely unchanged, analysts said. Junecontracts for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,settled at $17.99 per barrel, up 1 cent from Thursday.   The non-OPEC group, comprised of Mexico, China, Malaysia,Angola, Egypt and Oman, on Tuesday offered to reduce their oilexports by 5 percent if OPEC did likewise. The cuts would be forMay and June only.   OPEC leaders initially welcomed the offer, which marked thefirst such proposal from a group of outside oil producers sinceOPEC was founded in 1960. Some called it a historic first steptoward creating a global oil alliance.   Once the cartel leaders sat down to discuss the proposal,however, sharp differences emerged, officials said after an initialsession that ended early Friday.   The early discussions focused on whether supplies were farenough out of balance with demand to require a cut in production,said Fernandos Santos, Ecuador's oil minister. In an attempt toresolve this question, a team of technical experts from the 13cartel member countries met Friday afternoon.   The experts group failed to reach a unified view, however amajority of the experts said some form of additional productionrestraint was needed in order to get prices higher, according tosources speaking privately.   Saudi King Fahd appeared to signal on Thursday that he would notaccept any further reductions in OPEC production. He said priceswould go up if OPEC simply stuck to its existing output quotas,which often are violated.   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest oil producer, injected addedtension into the Vienna talks with its decision Tuesday to breakdiplomatic relations with Iran, citing what it called a hostileIranian attitude.   Iran, fighting a 7{-year-old war with Iraq, has attacked neutralshipping in the Persian Gulf, including Saudi ships, in retaliationfor Iraqi attacks on Iranian-chartered ships in the waterway.</TEXT></DOC>
