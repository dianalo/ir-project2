MARTIN: of people?     It's very important, as well,to be aware of the importance of the CFCE conference on measures of securitywhich must be decided by the European countries, plus United States andCanada.    A whole series of these proposals go exactly along _ I mean,but our views _ we think that the very future of Eastern Europe is conditionedby the way Eastern countries organize themselves, structure themselves,coordinate their efforts, and endow themselves with common source.   I often made this comparison _ including with President Bush _ if the horsesof the team don't move at the same speed, there will be an accident. Andwe have to deal with the German problem, in particular and that of EasternEurope at a pace which must be harmonious. It must be in step with thatof European construction.    And I must say that Mr. Baker's statementon the subject seemed to show great understanding of the needs of Europe.   Afterwards, there was the part that had to do with the evolution ofthe alliance and the content of NATO. Well, this is a subject tobe discussed.    We do not refuse. When a situation changes, the contentof alliances may change. And we belong to this alliance, although we havea special status within it. We are fully aware of our obligations as allies,as others must have as well in the same way.    So, now, this subjectis under study. The ideas were launched before the world public opinion,particularly Europe, and I have not yet met with my European partners sincethis major statement.    But, I agree on one point _ we cannot stay wherewe were before the collapse of all the walls that existed between the peoplesof Europe, and likewise, the concept of antagonists of enemies. A possibleconflict no longer arises in the same terms, or at least I hope. But, weneed, as the President George Bush was saying before, we need to know andobserve the evolution of the forthcoming months, which remains uncertainand which needs some time to rest, so as to enable us to see exactly whatis going on.    At the present time, we see the major trends, and onecan plan those perspectives, but we need this now to be completed beforedrawing any diplomatic and military consequences.</TEXT></DOC>
