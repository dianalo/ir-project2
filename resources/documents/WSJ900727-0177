If we assume that the king hasnot forgotten his ill-fated military alliance in 1967 withEgypt and Syria (despite clear messages from Israel that ifhe stayed out of the hostilities not an inch of theterritories he then controlled would be touched) and thedemagogy of the Arab leadership that succeeded in convincingitself of Israel's imminent demise, surely this &quot;longtimeU.S. ally and Arab moderate&quot; should not resort to suchprovocative history-twisting remarks.   It should be noted that, as in 1967, there is nowarmongering on the Israeli side. We are indeed involved withthe great event of Jewish immigration, mainly from the SovietUnion, and the immigrants' successful absorption into ourfree society. Peace is, therefore, our basic and absoluteneed and desire. We have never taken a belligerent attitudetoward those who have accepted our presence. If &quot;the regionis approaching the same state of hair-trigger tension,&quot; suchtension comes from the king's best friend and ally -- theIraqi president, Saddam Hussein.</LP><TEXT>   Combine this with the recent announcement of the settingup of a joint Iraqi-Jordanian air squadron and other jointmilitary maneuvers between these two countries and one canperhaps begin to understand which path the king has startedto tread.   &quot;With a photo of the Iraqi president just behind his {KingHussein's} shoulder,&quot; the U.S. and the entire world shouldrecall that old adage: Tell me who your friends are and I'lltell you who you are. Your majesty, take down that picture ofSaddam Hussein and replace it with that of Anwar Sadat. Thiswould symbolize a much more fruitful expression of yourconcern for the future welfare of your people and the entireMiddle East.   J. Eshel   J.J. Boock   Tel Aviv   ---   Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has been trying toreach a comprehensive peace agreement with its Arabneighbors. In contrast, 20 Arab countries have refused tonegotiate with or recognize Israel.   The 1967 war into which Israel was pulled saw Israelis ata moment of fear, despair and extreme anxiety for their fate.Arab countries, on the other side, coordinated theiraggression toward Israel by closing vital water channels,mobilizing their armies and threatening Israel for monthsbefore the war. Israel has never talked of starting a war. Asto the Arabs, historical documents and speeches attest tobelligerent statements made by Gamal Abdel Nasser (thenpresident of Egypt) and King Hussein of Jordan right beforethe 1967 war. King Hussein must be a hypocrite to say thatthe Arabs &quot;fell into a trap.&quot; He should read his own 1967speeches, to remember how he predicted the Israelis would bepushed into the sea.   King Hussein's preoccupations are not the poor Jewishimmigrants who are only trying to escape anti-Semiticbeatings and who plan to live in peace. Since practicallynone want to settle in the territories, Soviet immigrantspose no danger to Arabs who search for peace. They pose anobstacle only to those who dream of destroying the Jewishstate.   King Hussein is acting out of self-fear. The land where he&quot;reigns&quot; is about 70% Palestinian (not 50% as your reporterswrite), and he realizes that the Palestinian people aregrowing unhappy with his authoritative regime.   What is the true formula for disaster? King Hussein'sinstability, and his desperate alliance with Saddam Hussein,the butcher of Iraq.   Daniel Lubetzky   Tokyo   ---   King Hussein of Jordan is at it again. As he has done inthe past, he rewrites history, blames Israel and the U.S. forMiddle East problems, conjures up irrational fears thatIsrael will expel the Palestinians from the territories, andrefuses to accept his own responsibility for continuingconflict in the region.   He has the gall to say that Israel lured the Arabs intothe 1967 war. Arab aggression against Israel was a constantsince the Jewish state's creation in 1948 and reached a highpoint in 1967, including Egypt's closure of the Straits ofTiran, Syria's massing of troops and Jordan's attack onIsrael despite Israeli pleas to King Hussein to stay out ofthe war. King Hussein knows his decision to attack was ahistoric blunder; rather than face up to that fact, hecontinues to blame the party he attacked, which had the nerveto defend itself and win the war.   As usual, the king criticizes U.S. support for Israel andsuggests that such support could lead the region to war. Heomits to say that the U.S. continues to be a staunch ally ofthe king and that if there is a threat of war in the regionit comes from the bellicosity of Iraq's leader Saddam Husseinand the massing of ever-more-sophisticated arms -- missiles,chemical and biological weapons -- by the Arab world.   King Hussein conveniently ignores the fact that, after allthese years, he still has not recognized Israel, establishedrelations or moved toward peace. His words indicate that heisn't quite the moderate that he is widely perceived to be.   Abraham H. Foxman   National Director   Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith   New York</TEXT></DOC>
