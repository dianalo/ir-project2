Veerawat, the chief ranger of this rich wildlife sanctuaryastride the border with Burma, is among thousands who have joinedwhat unquestionably has become the greatest environmental battle inThailand's history _ a fight to persuade the government not tobuild a dam in Thailand's last virgin forest.   In a country that once was jungle-carpeted and teeming withwildlife, it is rare today to see a tract of undisturbed forest, anunpolluted river, white-handed gibbons or free-ranging tigers.   Anti-dam groups have held rock concerts and demonstrations, somefeaturing life-like models of crucified animals, in their campaign.   Newspapers are probing the issue in unprecedented detail. FormerPrime Minister Kukrit Pramoj says the government could face a massuprising if it approves the Nam Choan dam.   The dam's proponents say Nam Choam needs to be built, in what isthe largest remaining area of protected forest in Southeast Asia,to increase Thailand's energy supply by about 2 percent.   The government's Electric Generating Authority of Thailand hasdescribed the proposed, 580-megawatt dam as the ``last possibleexploitable source of hydro power'' in the country. It says it willcreate a reservoir that would also help irrigate farm land andassure water supplies in times of drought.   The projected dam site is still hard to get to: a lurching,nine-hour drive over dirt roads from Bangkok, the Thai capital,followed by a four-hour jungle trek. When monsoons lash thecountryside, a three-day elephant ride offers the only access.   But dam opponents claim construction of Nam Choan, with thenecessary approach roads, facilities and ensuing humanencroachment, would spell doom for what they say is also the lastarea in Thailand large enough to ensure the survival of a widevariety of wildlife.   Found in the Thung Yai and the adjacent Huay Kha KhaengSanctuary, an area about the size of Delaware, are large mammals,such as elephant, gaur, tiger and clouded leopard; some 350 speciesof birds, and a wide range of plant life. A number of the speciesare classified as endangered in Thailand, some worldwide.   Foreign conservation groups have written letters expressingconcern to the Thai government. In December, Britain's PrincePhilip, head of the World Wildlife Fund, urged an independentenvironmental impact study before a final decision is reached. Asimilar plea came from more than 1,300 conservationists andscientists at the general assembly in February of the Swiss-basedInternational Union for Conservation of Nature and NaturalResources.   The Electric Generating Authority maintains that Nam Choan woulddegrade only 4 percent of the area. But ranger Veerawat, who hasserved for 10 years in the sanctuary, contends the 47-mile-long damreservoir would not only eradicate a biologically vital riverinevalley but also disrupt the migration routes of animals, forcingthem into smaller habitats.   Opponents also dispute the 4 percent degradation estimate,saying that in Thailand roads built into remote, forested areashave inevitably been followed by massive logging, with collusionbetween businessmen and corrupt officials circumventing protectivelegislation.   Loggers are already felling the rich forests along the parkboundary.   Pisit na Patalung, secretary-general of Wildlife Fund Thailand,one of some 30 private organizations opposing the proposal, saidthe dam issue has raised an environmental awareness among Thais.Until recent years, the public appeared apathetic as the country'sonce teeming wildlife was slaughtered and forests that blanketedabout 70 percent of the country a generation ago were reduced toaround 15 percent of total area today.   The dam was first proposed in the early 1970s but plans wereshelved in 1983 in wake of protests and charges that environmentalimpact studies were sloppy and improper.   In 1986, the Electric Generating Authority asked that theproject be reconsidered and the government appointed a 40-mancommittee headed by Deputy Prime Minister Thienchai Sirisamphan tocome up with a decision, which is expected soon.   Some opponents believe government leaders will be impressed bytheir arguments that Thailand now has enough alternate energysources, including offshore natural gas and lignite, to scrap thedam proposal.   Others, however, feel that too many key bureaucrats andpoliticians are still little concerned over environmental problems.   Another wildlife ranger, Sueb Nakhasathien, didn't soundoptimistic.   ``Thais haven't yet put a price on the environment,'' he said.``They don't realize that trees and water have a price, thatwildlife has a price.''</TEXT></DOC>
