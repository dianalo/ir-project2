The ceremony was sponsored by four organizations, No GreaterLove, the National Press Club, the Overseas Press Club and theSociety of Professional Journalists, Sigma Delta Chi, and was heldat an oak tree planted by these organizations two years ago.   The audience of about 50 also was addressed by Don Mell, aphotographer who was with Terry Anderson when the Associated Press'chief Middle East correspondent was kidnapped in Beirut. Friday wasthe 1,302nd day of his captivity.   Mell said one man put a gun to his head while two others grabbedAnderson. ``I wanted to recue Terry, but I couldn't,'' Mell said.``At that moment Terry's eyes met mine as if to say, `Don, dosomething.'''   Peter Arnett, a Cable News Network correspondent who covered theVietnam war for the Associated Press, was master of ceremonies. ``Iprefer to believe,'' he said, ``that the hard-won traditions of thewar correspondents and the scarifice of those we honor today arebeacons for all journalists of today and tomorrow.'' he said.   The tree is in a cluster of memorials, one honoring Korean Warveterans, another for Prisoners of War and Missing in Action,another for the seven Challenger astronauts and one for thesoldiers and airmen who died in the attempt to free the Americanhostages in Lebanon.   Next to the tree is a memorial stone in the form of an openbook.
