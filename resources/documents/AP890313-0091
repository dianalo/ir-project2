Brauer, assistantIRS commissioner in charge of exempt organizations, said in a letterto Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Meansoversight subcommittee. Pickle released the report Monday.   Because of privacy laws, the report did not mention theministries by name. Identifying them only by number, Brauer outlinedkey issues against the 23, most of which are suspected of not fullyreporting their income, engaging in political activities, orallowing their earnings to benefit officials of the ministry.   The IRS stepped up its examination of TV ministries after thewell-publicized sex-and-bribery scandal at the PTL organizationheaded by Jim Bakker.   PTL, which apparently is ministry No. 15 in the report, is inbankruptcy court, where the IRS is pressing claims that Bakker andhis associates failed to pay tax on unrelated business income, suchas from rental of PTL's satellite network; failed to report someincome, and used PTL contributions for their own enrichment,including acceptance of salaries that the IRS contends wereexcessive.   Brauer said he expects several of the TV ministry cases ``willmove to the final stages of the examination process this year.''   ``We also anticipate that some of these cases will presentserious issues relating to continued federal income tax exemption,''Brauer said.   Brauer's cover letter said two organizations connected withformer Republican presidential candidate Pat Robertson have refusedto provide records of the type that other TV ministries haveprovided voluntarily.   Because the Freedom Council and the National Freedom Institutewould not cooperate, the letter stated, the IRS had to go to federalcourt in Norfolk, Va., to seek to enforce a summons for the records.   ``The degree of cooperation received by the service varies fromcase to case and, in one case involving a prominent evangelist, theservice has reached agreement on federal tax issues for the years1980 through 1983, including payment of substantial federal incometax, interest and penalties,'' Brauer wrote.   Here are highlights of the report, which was current through Dec.31:   _Ministry No. 1 was engaged in a lifestyle that led the IRS tobelieve that some income was not reported. Acting on an informant'stip, the Criminal Investigation Division prepared a case that hasbeen referred to a federal grand jury.   _No. 4: IRS agents are reviewing content of TV broadcasts todetermine whether they were primarily political.   _No. 8: A team of auditors and a computer specialist areinvestigating allegations of political activities, lobbying andpersonal enrichment from ministry funds.   _No. 11: As a result of a newspaper story, the IRS is auditingthe minister's individual tax return; the minister is notcooperating.   _No. 12: A computer picked this minister's return for audit ongrounds of unsubstantiated deductions. The case was closed withpayment of $3,000 tax and penalties.   _No. 16: The IRS has completed review of the books and recordsfor this ministry for 1984 through 1986; the chief issue is whethertax-deductible contributions to the ministry flowed to the benefitof the founder and his family. Alleged political activities also arebeing reviewed.   _No. 20: The minister's personal tax return was audited; he wasalleged to have channeled church assets to personal use. The casewas closed when he reported additional taxable income.</TEXT></DOC>
