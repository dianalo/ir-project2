Najib made the request in a letter sent to U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, said Foreign Ministryspokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani.   Amani also said guerrillas aided by Pakistani troops continuedrocket and artillery fire in and around the city of Jalalabad,where guerrillas have surrounded government forces since March 6.   Amani said the 11th and 18th divisions of Pakistan's army wereinside Afghanistan. In the last 24 hours, they had fired long-rangeweapons at Afghan government forces.   Kabul says the Pakistanis are sending a steady stream of troopsand weapons to help the guerrillas, who have been fighting theSoviet-backed government for nine years.   Pakistan, like the United States, supports the guerrillas butdenies having troops in Afghanistan.   Neither the border post proposal nor the accusation againstPakistan is new, but the allegations have increased in vehemenceand frequency since Feb. 15, when the last Soviet soldiers who hadbeen backing Najib's troops left the country.   Amani said there was no doubt the government was ``dominant'' inthe fight for Jalalabad, 75 miles east of Kabul. He claimed that inthe 24-hour period ending Wednesday evening, government forceskilled 137 opposition fighters and injured 56. Afghan army troopssuffered no casualties, he said.   Amani said five civilians were killed and 11 were wounded inJalalabad.   The Soviet Union's official Tass news agency said in a dispatchfrom Kabul that the cities of Herat, Ghazni, and Khost also cameunder heavy artillery fire from opposition forces and that fourchildren in tose cities were killed.   The figures could not be verified.   Jalalabad is the guerrillas' first offensive since the Sovietpullout and would be the biggest city they have captured. If itfalls, it would be a major blow to the morale of the government anda big boost to the rebels.   The government has not provided a death toll from the Jalalabadfighting, but reports issued since it began add up to more than2,600, with about 90 percent said to be guerrillas. The guerrillasgive far lower numbers.   In the letter to Perez de Cuellar, Najib said the U.N. GoodOffices Mission to Afghanistan and Pakistan, established to monitorthe departure of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, should take upduty on the border.   Amani said the proposal was urgent because the mission's mandateexpires Nov. 15.   The force of 40 unarmed men from 10 nations does not have amandate as a peacekeeping force. Its job since the Soviet pullouthas been to take complaints from Kabul and Islamabad about allegedviolations by the other side.   The Soviet withdrawal was brought about by a U.N.-sponsoredagreement signed in Geneva in April. As part of the accord,Afghanistan and Pakistan agreed not to interfere in each other'sinternal affairs.</TEXT></DOC>
