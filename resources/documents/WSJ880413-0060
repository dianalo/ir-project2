Donald I. Moritz, president of the energy company, said at a presentation for analysts yesterday that the projection was based on &quot;normal weather&quot; -- a variable that can greatly affect Equitable's utility-services business. The company has said 1987 results were depressed, in part, by higher-than-average temperatures.    Last month, Equitable reported 1987 operating profit of $34.6 million, or $1.69 a share, on revenue of $407.4 million. The company was aided by a credit of $6.5 million, derived from an accounting change.    Mr. Moritz also told analysts at the company's Pittsburgh headquarters that he expected increases in production revenue for Equitable's energy-resources segment. Specifically, he anticipated that production revenue would rise to $118 million in 1988 and to $130 million in 1989, compared with $102 million in 1987.    Equitable also said that it plans to spend $63 million in the current year to expand its natural-gas-reserve base in Appalachia.    Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Equitable shares closed at $35.125, down 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
