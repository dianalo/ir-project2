After exposure dogs wereobserved for late-occurring biological effects. Lung cancer has beena predominant observation for radionuclides inhaled in a relatively insolubleform because most of the absorbed dose was delivered to the lung andcontiguous tissues. Approximately 130 lung cancers were observed in dogsexposed to inhaled beta-emitting radionuclides; tumors occurred withabsorbed doses to lung ranging from 1100 to 68,000 rads. With inhaledalpha emitters lung tumors occurred at doses between 530 and 8400 rads.Dose rate pattern was shown to be an important factor in the inductionof lung cancer by inhaled beta emitters. Doses of low-LET irradiationdelivered in a matter of days can be as much as 8 times more effectiveper unit of dose than radiation doses delivered over a more protractedperiod of time. Tumors also have occurred in tracheobronchial lymph nodesof dogs that inhaled relatively insoluble forms of beta emitters. Fromthese studies, the risk of lung cancer from inhaled beta- or alpha-emittingradionuclides was compared to determine the importance of LET and otherdose-effect modifying factors on resulting risks and on extrapolationto human inhalation exposure. Attention also was given to the risk ofcancer in tracheobronchial lymph nodes, on the basis of the results ofthese studies and the current ICRP computational method in which lymphnodes are included with lung for purposes of dose and risk calculation.12 refs., 3 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
