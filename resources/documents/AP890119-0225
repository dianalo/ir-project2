Miami gets high marks for its training of officers and its policyon the use of lethal force. The amount of training is well aboveaverage and the department policy on the use of firearms isconsidered a national model.   ``It is a policy that by and large tells police officers not touse deadly force unless in defense of life and spells out when notto use your gun,'' said James Fyfe, a criminologist at AmericanUniversity and an expert in the use of deadly force.   Clement Anthony Lloyd, 23, was fatally shot in the head byOfficer William Lozano on Monday. Lloyd's passenger, 24-year-oldAllen Blanchard, died the following day of injuries suffered whenthe motorcycle crashed. Both men were black.   Some witnesses claim Lozano fired after the motorcycle passedhim. But Lozano's attorney said Lloyd was driving toward his clientand that the officer shot in self-defense. ``Officer Lozano believedhis life was threatened,'' said Roy Black.   Investigations are under way by the FBI, state attorney's officeand the city's department of internal affairs. The city also agreedto set up an independent review board of police and Overtownresidents.   For many blacks, the incident was the latest in a long line ofclashes with police that has resulted in an us-against-themmentality.   ``The police in this area shoot first and ask questions laterwhen it comes to blacks,'' said Hilda McPhee, 30.   In 1980, the acquittal of four white Miami officers onmanslaughter charges in the beating death of a 33-year-old black mantouched off three days of rioting in Liberty City that left 18people dead, 400 injured and some $100 million in damage.   In 1982, rioting erupted in Overtown after the fatal shooting ofa black man by a Cuban-born police officer. Million of dollars indamages resulted. More violence followed in 1984 after the officerwas acquitted.   Miller Dawkins, the Miami City Commission's only black member,said blacks don't condone the latest rioting but added, ``I have aproblem with a policeman who shoots a man for a traffic violation.''   Raymond Lang, a police spokesman, said department policyprohibits officers from shooting at moving vehicles ``unless itposes an imminent danger to their life or someone else's.''   But Lang said policy is sometimes hard to follow when an officerfeels threatened.   ``You can teach someone in the classroom the principles of deadlyforce, but when they're out in the street and the adrenaline startsto pump and things are unfolding ...,'' he said.   All South Florida police officers attend a regional traininginstitute where they receive a minimum of 800 hours of basictraining, nearly double that of some other jurisdictions, said JimStinchcomb, director of the Southeast Florida Institute of CriminalJustice.   However, Kevin Parsons, a consultant in Appleton, Wis., whodesigns training programs for local and federal law enforcementagencies, said training too often emphasizes the use of guns withoutoffering alternatives.   ``Far more often I see officers who did not have the skills tocope rather than officers who intentionally went out of their way toabuse someone because of race,'' he said.   Sgt. Mike Mazur, a 19-year veteran of the force, said police arelikely to continue using deadly force.   ``There's no doubt in my mind police officers have to useforce,'' he said. ``To chastise an officer for acting is wrong. Doyou expect him to go down with the scum of the earth?''</TEXT></DOC>
