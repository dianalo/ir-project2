In addition to closing the facilities in Fernald, Ohio, and Rocky Flats, Colo., the draft report, which outlines the future of the 14-plant nuclear-weapon complex to the year 2010, recommends streamlining operations at three other facilities.    The Energy Department for months has been considering the future of the facilities, which date from the early 1950s. A final report is due in December. Currently, production of weapons material has been stopped at three of the primary sites because of strikes and safety concerns.    Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste has already called for closing the Fernald plant, where workers have been on strike for about a month. The plant prepares uranium-metal forms for the N reactor in Hanford, Wash., and employs about 1,500 people.    Westinghouse Electric Corp. took over the management of the 37-year-old Fernald facility in 1986, and much of the company's work has focused on environmental cleanup. Production has been cut back, as the N reactor has been closed for safety reasons.    The Energy Department disclosed in recent court documents that it ordered its former contractor at Fernald, NL Industries Inc., to routinely dump radioactive waste in a local river, and that it stored uranium wastes in open pits.    Both the Fernald plant and the Rocky Flats plant, which employs 5,500, were rated as &quot;marginal&quot; in terms of safety by a recent General Accounting Office study. Rocky Flats, which casts plutonium components for weapons, has been closed for several weeks, after three workers were accidently exposed to low levels of plutonium.    The facility also ran into trouble this week, when a train car full of contaminated clothes and tools was blocked from its disposal site in Idaho in a political standoff. The Rocky Flats site has about four months of waste-storage capacity remaining on site, a Colorado state official said.    The draft report also recommended that several facilities be consolidated into &quot;supersites&quot; focusing on one activity. The Savannah River site at Aiken, S.C., would exclusively produce one nuclear-weapons component, tritium; in earlier years, some of its four reactors also produced plutonium. Plutonium would be produced only at the Idaho National Engineering Lab, and uranium for weapons would be produced only at the Oak Ridge, Tenn., facility.    The report is still subject to several layers of review at the Energy Department, the sources said. The department declined to comment on the specifics of the report.    The department plans to restart its K reactor at Savannah River by late December, safety officials say, but they acknowledge that those plans may be ambitious. &quot;Two weeks ago we issued prerequisites for a start-up,&quot; said Richard Starostecki, head of quality assurance. &quot;It's premature to comment on whether those will be met.&quot;    Prerequisites for a start-up include better and more-specific staff training, and adding personnel in the control room who have experience in commercial nuclear reactors where operating standards are more stringent, he said.    The Federation of American Scientists assailed the restart plans, contending it's too risky until after an exhaustive safety review. All of the Savannah River reactors have been shut since August, after an unexpected power surge in one of the reactors.    &quot;It makes a big difference doing the safety modifications if you think you have six months to do them, or a year, or a year and a half to plan,&quot; said David Albright, senior staff scientist of the federation, a 5,000-member group organized to combat the nuclear-arms race. </TEXT></DOC>
