Several analysts said recent reports of production-quota violations by some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries led to sporadic selling. Some traders began to think that the oil cartel had &quot;reverted to the same old game&quot; of overproducing that pounded down oil prices last year, Bill Hinton, oil broker for Balfour Maclaine Inc., New York, said.    Some traders, moreover, reacted negatively to recent reports that Saudi Arabia would resume its role as a swing producer. The Saudis, who had filled that role for years until renouncing it 15 months ago, recently have indicated they will again absorb production excesses to sustain higher oil prices. Several analysts saw the new Saudi stance as a tacit acknowledgment that quota cheating will continue.    &quot;The danger in this whole thing is that if the Saudis are willing to resume the swing producer role, it will be a signal to other OPEC producers to violate the agreement,&quot; Nauman Barakat, oil analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York, said.    With its December agreement to cut production and shore up prices, &quot;OPEC laid a foundation with the Saudis as the cornerstone,&quot; Stephen Piasio, vice president of the international energy department at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., New York, said. &quot;Some traders are perceiving the Saudi action as an indication of fissures in that foundation,&quot; he said.    Traders and analysts said a continuing surplus of distillates also put pressure on prices yesterday, leading many traders to liquidate their long, or buying, positions. Computer-guided program selling added to the declines, brokers said.    Heating oil contracts for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange dropped 1.71 cents a gallon to 47.88 cents. March crude oil contracts skidded 39 cents to $18.06 a barrel. The more active April contract was off 46 cents at $17.88 a barrel. Unleaded gasoline for March delivery fell 1.43 cents to 49.37 cents a gallon.    On the spot, or non-contract, market, the price of the U.S. bellwether crude, West Texas intermediate, fell 40 cents to $17.95 a barrel. The spot price of North Sea Brent, the widely traded European blend, fell 35 cents to $17.55 a barrel.    On the spot, or non-contract, market, the price of the U.S. bellwether crude, West Texas Intermediate, fell 40 cents to $18.05 a barrel. The spot price of North Sea Brent, the widely traded European blend, fell 20 cents to $17.70 a barrel.    Inventory figures released by an industry group after the futures market closed Tuesday also spurred some of yesterday's selling, several traders and brokers said. The American Petroleum Institute reported, among other things, that U.S. refiners operated at 80.2% of capacity for the week ended Friday, about unchanged from the week before but higher than 76.9% a year earlier.    &quot;Many traders had been expecting a big refinery-run cut,&quot; Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc., New York, said. &quot;When they didn't see that, the overall impression was somewhat negative.&quot;    Futures prices probably will remain under pressure until the surplus of refined products is whittled further, analysts said. &quot;We've got to start seeing some increase in end-use demand,&quot; Andrew Lebow, oil analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York, said.    Jayne Ball, an oil broker for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., New York, predicted that crude oil contracts will fall at least to $17 a barrel before the end of the month.    Separately, the New York Mercantile Exchange reduced margin requirements on oil futures contracts because of the recent lack of volatility in the market. The customer margin, or good-faith deposit, for most crude oil, heating oil and unleaded gasoline positions was lowered by 25% to $1,500 a contract, exchange officials said. </TEXT></DOC>
