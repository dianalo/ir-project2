Heading for the Big House, Cecil conveys the newsto Mr. McHugh, the local authority figure, who knows just howthese things should be handled -- i.e., covered up. Onesuspects this was chosen as the opening story on account ofits supposed shock effect, but there is remarkably little toshock -- or even hold the attention of -- the reader in thisoverly understated reworking of a theme that has long sincepassed into the realm of cliches.   The remaining six stories, however, are a pleasantsurprise. They, too, are rural in setting, understated instyle, and deal with venerable themes such as fathers andsons, husbands and wives, values and a sense of place. Buteach contains something fresh and unexpected, something thatshows that Mr. Tilghman is a realist who has observed realitycarefully enough to have noticed things other realist writershave overlooked.</LP><TEXT>   The title story portrays an uncomfortable encounterbetween a middle-aged widower and his high-strung son'sgirlfriend, an alarmingly tough, humorless graduate studentbusily calculating the resale value of her fiance's familyheirlooms. &quot;Norfolk, 1969&quot; takes us into the mind and heartof a young naval officer opposed to the Vietnam War, butexhilarated by his shipboard experience; unable to considerhimself one of the career officers, but alienated by hiswife's conversion to the fringes of the antiwar movement. Mr.Tilghman deftly picks out the tiny pressure points that leadto an inevitable parting of the ways.   &quot;Loose Reins&quot; follows a grown-up son revisiting hiswidowed mother in Montana and trying to come to terms withher marriage to a former ranch hand. The last story, &quot;Mary inthe Mountains,&quot; explores the mental landscape of a quietlyunusual woman as she ruminates -- without blame or bitterness-- on her fate as an abandoned wife. These stories prove thatthere's still life in the agrarian literary tradition,particularly when a writer knows where to look for it.   Steven Millhauser's new collection, &quot;The Barnum Museum&quot;(Poseidon, 208 pages, $18.95), sets out to be a colorful,wildly inventive melange of meta-fictional fictions, rifewith literary allusions and the kind of playful artificepopularized by Donald Barthelme. But like a deck of playingcards, this set of 10 stories turns out to be less colorful,more predetermined, than promised. Typical is &quot;A Game ofClue,&quot; a rather strained confection that juxtaposes therelations among some real people playing that board game withthe imaginary affairs of the characters depicted in the game:Miss Scarlet, Colonel Mustard et al. Neither group isparticularly engaging. In &quot;Behind the Blue Curtain,&quot; a boymanages to penetrate the mysterious world beyond themovie-theater screen. Again, it's less intriguing than itshould be. &quot;Klassic Komix 1&quot; is, despite its early number, arather tired literary joke: cutely described frames from acomic book illustrating &quot;The Love Song of J. AlfredPrufrock.&quot;   Other stories are more successful, taken on their ownterms, as bravura feats of the author's visual imagination.The title story tours a museum of artifice, fantasy, a purefakery described in splendid detail. &quot;The Invention of RobertHerendeen&quot; concerns a young man blessed or cursed with suchsuperfluity of imagination that he invents a fantasy woman,conceived in such vivid detail as to seem more real than anyreality.   The Canadian writer Carol Shields, author of storycollections, plays and novels, also is preoccupied with theshifting balance between imagination and reality. But shehandles her themes with the kind of grace and controlledlightness that suggest power held wisely in reserve. The 12stories in &quot;The Orange Fish&quot; (Viking, 199 pages, $17.95)cover a considerable range of subject matter, from the upbeatstory of &quot;Hazel,&quot; a middle-aged widow who astounds herchildren and her friends by taking a job demonstratingkitchen appliances, to the sorrows of Miss Georgia Willow, a&quot;stern peremptory social arbiter&quot; whose lifelong dedicationto &quot;Good Manners&quot; has involved her in a private life ofhapless sexual compliance.   Ms. Shields has a gift for describing the odd littlethings and experiences that can provoke intense feelings ofjoy or happiness but that remain nameless, hard tocategorize, hence, unnoticed in the usual &quot;curriculum vitae&quot;.&quot;Chemistry&quot; is a recollection, some 18 years later, of thespecial feeling that once blossomed among the students andteacher of an adult-education class. &quot;Collision&quot; records achance encounter in an East European country between a manand woman who do no more than share an umbrella in the rain.In the title story, a depressed couple &quot;deep in theirthirties&quot; purchase a handsome lithograph of an orange fishthat subtly improves their lives. What happens when thislife-enhancing work of art becomes a commercialized,mass-market product? Ms. Shields is the kind of writer whocan answer such a question, wittily, poignantly and ruefully.   ---   Ms. Rubin is a free-lance writer living in Los Angeles.</TEXT></DOC>
