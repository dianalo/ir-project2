<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-55-0023 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new method is proposed for calculating the oxidation of iron in thepresence of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. It is assumed that theoxidation is limited by an internal oxidation step. The calculationalmethod, based on methods previously used to calculate the hydriding ofuranium, uses no parameters for the calculation. The known oxygen solubilityand diffusivity in iron along with the precipitation rate constants,all of which are obtainable from the literature, are used to make thecalculation. The calculation is in good agreement with the rates of oxidationobserved, which would seem to validate the method. 13 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
