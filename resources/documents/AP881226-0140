Tiny, crowded Hong Kong in June ended one of the region's mostgenerous asylum programs and began screening new arrivals toseparate political refugees from economic migrants, who are to berepatriated. Officials said that instead of the ethnic Chinese fromthe bourgeois class the communists once persecuted, most new boatpeople were peasants difficult to resettle abroad.   Guards at Hei Ling Chau Center used their feet, fists and batonsto beat Vietnamese on June 19 when they went on a hunger strikeafter complaining they were not getting enough food. The medicalstaff examined 100 Vietnamese in 45 minutes.   More than 4,000 other Vietnamese were crammed into the top floorsof a 12-story factory building which U.N. officials likened to aprison unfit for human habitation. Wooden barriers on the windowsshut out sunlight and there was one restroom for 600 people.Authorities later decided to close the camp.   Community groups strongly protested when the government said itwould abandon the system of closed camps where Vietnamese cannot gooutside without special permission. In one public opinion poll, 73percent of Hong Kong residents surveyed opposed allowing the boatpeople to land.   Malaysia said it was fed up with boat arrivals and threatened toclose its Pulau Bidong camp housing more than 10,000 boat people bythe end of 1989. Officials warned the country would begin turningaway boats from its shores.   A U.S. Navy ship, the USS Dubuque, abandoned a driftingramshackle boat of Vietnamese in the South China Sea in June, andsome starving passengers said they later murdered and ate two boyson board. Fifty-two passengers survived 37 days at sea, but 58 died.   The commander of the Dubuque, Capt. Alexander G. Balian, has beenrelieved of duty.   Moreover, pirate attacks have become much more savage. Comparedwith the same period last year, the number of Vietnamese reporteddead or missing in attacks in the first nine months of this yearsoared from 21 to 428 and those raped or abducted from 61 to 142.   These tragedies have posed a dilemma: How do you preserve theright of asylum without encouraging more people to flee?   Nations attending talks in Bangkok this fall urged a package ofmeasures, including repatriation, and renewed pledges of asylum andresettlement based on region-wide screening like that in Hong Kong.   The United States has quietly expressed support for involuntaryrepatriation of economic migrants under certain conditions. In othermajor policy shifts, it has proposed a moratorium on resettlementand narrowing its program to Vietnamese who qualify as immigrants orare of special humanitarian concern, such as people held inpolitical ``re-education'' camps because of their U.S. ties duringthe war.   ``We've always had a resettlement-driven policy, but there is agrowing awareness that resettlement has a negative impact'' byencouraging the boat exodus, says a U.S. Embassy official.   In a recent interview in Hanoi, Assistant Foreign Minister VuKhoan said Vietnam was trying to discourage the boat exodus byexpanding the Orderly Departure Program for people to leave onregular jet flights, and the resettlement in the United States ofhalf-American children and former re-education inmates. Vietnam alsonow allows people to travel abroad to visit relatives or for work,study and medical care, he said.   Western sources say Vietnam also has increased border patrols,clamped down on boat people smugglers and mounted a public awarenesscampaign to discourage flight.   The Orderly Departure Program has expanded and the 2,221resettled in the United States in September was a record high month.The United States has taken half of the more than 145,000 Vietnameseresettled since the program began in 1979 and has applications from700,000 others. But establishing a special program for formerinmates remains stalled by political differences with Vietnam.   Sixty-two percent of some 2,300 Vietnamese who landed in Thailandin the first half of this year told aid officials they or theirrelatives had spent time in re-education.   Economic policies are ``the main weapon the communists use togovern the country,'' says Nguyen Huu Giao, a former lawyer who isthe Vietnamese administrator at Ban Thad. ``They cannot control thepopulation without trying to control their stomachs.''   Giao, 49, says he spent 10 years in re-education after speakingout for human rights. He paid a smuggler about $2,500 worth of goldto flee the country shortly after his release in October 1987.   He says he would never go back, and like many others at Ban Thadis convinced that someday he will be granted his wish to start a newlife in the West.   ``I don't think Thailand will keep us here all our lives,'' hesays. ``I will wait as long as they want.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
