It's a trap the president could find himself skirtingagain and again, as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein takes on adual role as Persian Gulf strongman and oil policeman.</LP><TEXT>   Nine days ago, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, BrentScowcroft, and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney quietly agreedto a request from the United Arab Emirates to conduct jointmilitary exercises with an expanded U.S. force in the PersianGulf. The muscle-flexing was largely seen in the West as away to show that the U.S. is prepared to defend the UAE andKuwait. Iraq had threatened to punish both for exceedingproduction quotas set by the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries and thereby driving down oil prices.   The immediate military tensions seem to have cooled, asIraq and Kuwait opened talks over the weekend in Saudi Arabiato ease the dispute. But the risk the Bush administrationruns is that it will be seen in the Middle East as not simplyhaving answered a friend's call for help, but rather ashaving intervened militarily to encourage overproduction ofoil to drive down prices for the U.S.'s own imports.   That is a dangerous perception. In the long run, it couldrally all Middle East oil producers behind the conspiracytheories woven by the region's radicals, most notably Mr.Hussein of Iraq.   &quot;A military exercise in a sense confirms -- as it will beplayed out in the propaganda of the hawkish states -- whatSaddam Hussein has been saying all along,&quot; says G. Henry M.Schuler, an energy analyst at the Center for Strategic andInternational Studies. &quot;And that is that this is all a plotby the U.S. and Kuwait to lower oil prices.&quot;   Bush administration aides are painfully aware of thedanger of appearing to meddle inside OPEC. So they are busytrying to damp any such theories.   &quot;You haven't noticed, nor will you, any statement comingout of here about internal OPEC policy,&quot; says a senioradministration official. &quot;For us the issue is use of force inthe gulf, and it's that simple.&quot;   In fact, the U.S. probably had little choice but torespond with military movements when asked by the UAE, a tinysheikdom all but defenseless compared with Iraq. As the U.S.was responding, Iraq was moving thousands of troops, hardenedby the Iran-Iraq war, to its disputed border with Kuwait.   By the middle of last week, Iraq had moved up enoughbattle-support units that U.S. intelligence analystsconcluded it was capable not only of striking at Kuwait butof moving deep inside Saudi Arabia within a week if it choseto do so.   This Iraqi brinkmanship brought Mr. Hussein a partialvictory when OPEC agreed at the end of the week to a newoutput ceiling to end Kuwaiti and UAE overproduction andraise the cartel's target price to $21 a barrel from $18. Butthat won't end the Iraqi challenge. U.S. officials calculatethat Mr. Hussein's goals are a $25-a-barrel target price,$2.4 billion in payments from Kuwait for a disputed oil fieldon their border and a new role for himself as OPEC enforcer.   All this represents a troubling long-term trend for theU.S., which has long counted on cooler heads among SaudiArabia's ruling family to be the key arbiters of OPECpolicies. Though the Saudis share Iraq's concern aboutoverproduction and desire for higher prices, they have alwaysargued for gentle and predictable increases in oil prices tokeep the world economy in good shape and prevent a switch toalternative energy sources.   There is little reason to think that Mr. Hussein, pressedto pay off multibillion-dollar debts from the Iran-Iraq war,holds such a moderate, long-term view.   Moreover, the rise in his hawkish influence comes at a badtime for the U.S. The Bush administration and congressionalbudget negotiators are increasingly drawn to some kind ofenergy-based tax to cut the federal deficit. Yet Iraq'sassertiveness seems to assure that there will be someenergy-price increase in coming months, which would compoundthe economic impact of an energy tax.   Against that backdrop, a temptation in the U.S. to try toinfluence oil politics may grow despite the inherent risks. Abetter option, some suggest, is for the U.S. to redouble itsefforts to build rapport with Mr. Hussein despite hisbluster. &quot;It behooves the U.S. not to isolate Iraq, not toallow it to become the lone warrior out there,&quot; saysChristine Helms, a Middle East analyst and expert on Iraq.&quot;Isolation produces radicalism.&quot;   Yet selling such a policy is increasingly difficult, asCongress clamors to cut U.S. links to Baghdad andadministration aides see Mr. Hussein's recent threats as justone more mark in the growing ledger of his troubling actions.</TEXT></DOC>
