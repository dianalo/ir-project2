West German Red Cross official Wolfgang Wagner also saidauthorities believed East German police have infiltrated theemergency camps in Hungary that are holding thousands of peopleawaiting safe passage to the West.   ``We reckon that's so, but we're not equipped to do anythingabout it,'' he said in response to a question.   He sought to dampen speculation that the transfer would beginSunday, telling reporters the East Germans would leave ``sometime''this week. Asked what was holding up the exodus, Wagner said:``We're awaiting word from the West German Embassy.''   Since vacationing East Germans began crowding the embassy inBudapest to demand passage to the West in July, the embassy hasdeclined to comment on the developments.   While legal travel to the West is difficult for most EastGermans, they have relatively little difficulty getting permissionfrom their Communist government to visit Hungary, a liberal Sovietbloc country. More than 1 million have vacationed here annually inthe last few years.   More than 200,000 East Germans were thought to be in Hungarybefore the weekend, and Premier Miklos Nemeth has estimated that upto 20,000 of them want to go to West Germany.   A bilateral agreement obliges Hungary to send East Germans tryingto flee to the West back to their homeland. But Hungarian officialshave refused to do so, and their decision to permit the East Germansto go West has led to tensions with East Berlin.   It also has resulted in a strengthening of ties with WestGermany, where government officials have praised Hungary's handlingof the problem.   Karsten Voigt, a senior West German opposition official, lastweek called on government officials to provide financial and moralsupport for Hungary's reform-minded Communist leaders.   On Saturday, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl appealed tocountrymen to welcome the East Germans, while other officials andpoliticians called on the East Berlin leadership to stop the exodusby introducing reforms.   Holidaying East Germans, frustrated by political rigidity andeconomic stagnation at home, began using Hungary as a springboard tothe West after it started removing barbed wire and other barriersfrom its border with Austria in May.   Since then, more than 6,000 are estimated to have fled to Austriaen route to West Germany, which grants them automatic citizenshipand helps them start new lives by giving them financial and socialaid.   Others seeking to emigrate first crowded the West German Embassyin Budapest. With government approval, Hungarian charitableorganizations opened the first camps for East Germans in mid-August,after the crush of would-be refugees staying in the embassy forcedBonn to close it.   Wagner said that 4,000 East Germans had been placed in four campsand a small boarding house by early Sunday afternoon, following morethan 1,000 new arrivals during the weekend.   Hundreds more were staying in tents and trailers near the Zankacamp, about 90 miles southwest of Budapest, said other Red Crossofficials.   While no official details of plans to move the East Germans hadbeen made public by Sunday, developments in Austria and West Germanyover the past week indicated they would be moved by rail throughAustria to temporary quarters in Bavaria, the main West German statebordering Austria.   In Bavaria Sunday, volunteer workers put the finishing touches onfive tent communities with room for more than 5,000 people. Austrianrail officials continued to hold up to 50 railway cars ready forquick movement to border points with Hungary.   Many of those in the Budapest camps huddled in tents or trailersto escape occasional showers, while others attended religiousservices on camp grounds or in city churches.</TEXT></DOC>
