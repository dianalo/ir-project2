The Commerce Department said the performance of the grossnational product, the broadest measure of economic health, slowed inthe third quarter after growing at an annual rate of 3.2 percentduring the first six months of the year.   It was the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 1986, whenthe economy grew at a sluggish 1.4 percent rate.   The report, however, represents an upward revision from apreliminary estimate last month, which pegged growth at 2.2 percent.   The department attributed the revision to a higher-than-expectedrise in personal consumption expenditures, which account for nearlytwo-thirds of economic activity. They rose at an annual rate of 4percent in the third quarter, compared with an earlier estimate of3.5 percent.   Also, non-farm business inventories grew faster than originallythought. However, this could be a source of weakness in the futureif consumer demand slackens and manufacturers have to cut productionas the inventories are sold off.   A price index tied to the GNP also proved more brisk than wasfirst estimated. The index, which reflects changing consumptionpatterns as well as prices, rose at an annual rate of 4.7 percent,up from the first estimate of 4.4 percent. The second quarter soaredat an even faster 5.5 percent, the highest in nearly six years.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the latestreport does not change ``the basic economic picture'' of moderategrowth and steady inflation.   ``Inflation remains at about the second quarter rate. And, afteradjusting for the effects of the drought, the economy continues togrow at its long-term average pace, which is 2 to 3 percent,'' hesaid.   However, the revisions to the GNP were about in line witheconomists' expectations and fit in with anticipation in the marketthat the Federal Reserve Board will soon move to curb inflation bydampening growth with higher interest rates.   Major banks on Monday raised their prime lending rate to 10.5percent, the highest level since mid-1985. Economists expect a newround of increases as the Fed tries to restrain growth to anon-inflationary pace of 2 percent to 2.5 percent.   The Fed pushed up interest rates steadily from late March throughearly August. For a time, it appeared the medicine was taking hold.A number of statistical reports showed slower growth in August andSeptember.   Government numbers released over the last three weeks, however,portray robust growth in October, the first month of the fourthquarter.   ``It's amazing how strong the momentum is now,'' said DavidJones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co., a governmentsecurities dealer in New York. ``... We'll be starting the seventhyear of an economic expansion and the normal peacetime expansionlasts only three years.''   He predicts growth will accelerate to an annual rate of about 3.5percent in the final three months of 1988, even with the aftershocksfrom the drought.   The Commerce Department said that without the drought thirdquarter growth would have been a strong 3.2 percent and secondquarter growth would have been a brisk 3.9 percent, rather than 3.0percent. The effect of the drought in the fourth quarter isestimated to be about double the drag in the third quarter.   The two engines of economic growth in the first half of the year_ exports and business investment _ played less of role in the thirdquarter.   Exports and imports both grew at an annual rate of 11.6 percent.Because imports were growing from a larger base, however, thenation's inflation-adjusted trade deficit as measured by the GNPworsened slightly for the first time in a year.   Business investment grew at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in thethird quarter, down from 15.0 percent in the second quarter.   James Annable, an economist with First National Bank of Chicago,predicted that exports and investment spending will rebound, in partbecause of the continued fall of the dollar, which hit a 40-year lowlast week against the Japanese yen.   A lower dollar makes American goods cheaper on overseas markets,spurring export sales. The higher sales, in turn, stimulate spendingby manufacturers to increase productive capacity.   However, stronger growth brings with it the danger of higherprices as the economy strains to meet demand. Already, factories areusing more of their production capacity _ 84 percent _ than at anytime in more than eight years. With unemployment at a 14-year low of5.3 percent, businesses are offering higher wages to attract workers.   ``It's likely the Federal Reserve will respond by pushing upinterest rates and tightening credit. ... Banks are alreadyanticipating this process by raising their prime rate,'' Jones said.   Higher interest rates discourage spending by both consumers andbusinesses, thus slowing economic expansion.   ``What the Fed is trying to do is engineer a moderation of growthto a somewhat less inflationary pace. It's a very delicate balancingact. The tightening so far just wasn't enough to do the job,'' Jonessaid.   The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation,at an annual rate of $4.01 trillion.   In an accompanying report, the Commerce Department said after-taxcorporate profits rose a slight 0.2 percent in the third quarterafter soaring 8.9 percent in the second quarter. The July-Septembergain was the lowest since a loss in the fourth quarter of 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
