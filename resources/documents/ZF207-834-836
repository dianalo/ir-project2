(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Steve HigginsandM;Strengthening its commitment to enterprisewide networking, Ungermann-BassInc. recently announced a downsized internetwork hub, eight new bridges andtwo new AppleTalk networking packages.andM;The new Access/One is, literally, the hub of Ungermann-Bass' latest productannouncements, all of which will be available by year's end, companyofficials said.andP;  The new unit, which supports as many as five internetworkbridges or Apple Computer Inc.andP;  AppleTalk networks simultaneously, istargeted at users who found the original 12-slot Access/One too large fortheir needs, the officials said.andP;  Priced at $2,095, the new five-slot hubwill cost half as much as the 12-slot model.andM;Both large and small Access/One hubs are designed to be used with newUngermann-Bass Macintosh networking software to join AppleTalk networks tostandard PC LANs.andM;A new Access/One module, called MaxTalk, provides support for as many as 16Apple LocalTalk devices attached to the hub.andP;  MaxTalk supports both the newerversion of AppleTalk (released in June) and the original version, accordingto Michael Gardner, vice president of marketing and sales for the SantaClara, Calif., company.andP;  MaxTalk is priced at $4,695.andM;Ungermann-Bass will also offer Mac workstation software that supports TCP/IPinternetwork protocols.andP;  Used with Access/One, MaxTalk and Ungermann-Basshardware that links host and PC networks, the new Macintosh UniversalWorkstation Software (MacUWS) will enable Macs to exchange messages withTCP/IP-based LANs or host systems, Gardner said.andM;MacUWS consists of two modules: the MacTCP driver that includes the TCP/IPprotocols, and an applications module that supports multisession Telnet orVT100 terminal emulation, according to company officials.andP;  MacUWS will cost$350 per workstation.andM;Expanding the reach of the Access/ One hub to embrace the emerging FiberDistributed Data Interface (FDDI) specification for fiber-optic networks,Ungermann-Bass unveiled a pair of new FDDI bridges.andM;The Ethernet-to-FDDI SuperLAN Bridge connects all 802.3 Ethernet networks toan FDDI backbone for 100M-bps transmissions between Ethernet networks.andP;  TheFDDI bridge transparently passes XNS, TCP/IP, DECnet and OSI protocols andfilters messages to local stations.andM;Ungermann-Bass also will offer a Token-Ring version of the SuperLAN bridgethat supports IBM-compatible source routing, transparently linking toToken-Ring network segments.andM;In addition to the FDDI bridges, the firm will release a localToken-Ring-to-Ethernet bridge; two local Ethernet bridges, one each forbaseband and broadband cable; a remote Ethernet bridge for linking EthernetLANs over synchronous lines; and a remote Token-Ring bridge that will connectToken-Ring LANs over synchronous lines.andM;Pricing for the new bridges will start at $3,950.andM;Ungermann-Bass can be reached at (408) 970-7300.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
