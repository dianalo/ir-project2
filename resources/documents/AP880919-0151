The American Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, said after thethree fled from detention in a hospital to the consulate inJohannesburg a week ago that the United States would not force themto leave against their will. It is against U.S. policy, however, togrant them asylum at a diplomatic mission, the embassy said.   Thus ``the three men remain in temporary refuge,'' StateDepartment spokesman Charles Redman told reporters.   In South Africa, he said, ``We have explained what our policyis, and what we are doing, and where we stand.''   The three activists are Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Vallio Moosa,of the United Democratic Front, and Vusi Khanyile, chairman of theNational Education Crisis committee.   U.S. civil rights activist Jesse Jackson met for an hour lastWednesday with South African Ambassador Pieter Koornhof for a talkthat both described as positive.   Asked whether the U.S. government regards Jackson as anintermediary in the affair, Redman said, ``There is no U.S.intermediary role in the sense that you are referring to, and I amnot sure what contact that Mr. Jackson has had with the people inthe consulate.''   Jackson planned to make some telephone calls to South Africa,but his office in Chicago said they had not yet been made.</TEXT></DOC>
