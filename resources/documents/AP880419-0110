Two other Arabs were expelled from Israel and flown by an armyhelicopter to Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in southLebanon, the army reported.   The deportations raised to 20 the number of Palestiniansexpelled since the start of the Palestinian uprising Dec. 8. Morethan 1,000 Arabs have been deported since 1967.   So far, 167 Palestinians have died in the unrest, according toU.N. figures. Two Israelis also have been killed.   The army accused the deported Palestinians of inciting andorganizing disturbances in the occupied West Bank. It said they hadappealed to an army review board but did not take their case to theSupreme Court.   Army officials said the six Beita residents were involved in astoning attack against 16 Jewish teen-agers and two armed guardsfrom a nearby West Bank settlement on April 6.   A settler girl and two Beita residents were killed in the clash.An army report said the girl was killed by a bullet fired from theweapon of one of the Jewish guards.   The army has destroyed the homes of 13 Beita residents linked tothe stoning attack.   Hanna Siniora, a prominent Palestinian editor, said thedeportations were a message that Israel ``wants to continue theoccupation and is disregarding Palestinian national rights.''   ``Such a policy will inflame the situation and actually add tothe determination of the Palestinian people in their struggle fortheir national aspirations,'' said Siniora, editor of the pro-PLOdaily newspaper Al Fajr.   The United States has condemned deportations, saying the measureviolated the Geneva Convention which bans the transfer acrossborders of civilians living in occupied zones.   Israel, which has not accepted the applicability of theconventions to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, has defended thepractice, saying only mass expulsions were barred and that suchpunishment was less severe than execution, permitted by theconventions.   Also today, an Israeli Cabinet minister criticized the slayingof PLO commander Khalil al-Wazir, warning it would backfire onIsrael. The army censored a newspaper editorial about Israel'sreported role in the assassination.   Soldiers sealed off parts of the occupied West Bank and GazaStrip and clamped a curfew on 17 towns, cities and refugee campsfor a third straight day to quell rioting in the occupiedterritories, the military said.   Nineteen Palestinians have been killed since Saturday's slayingof al-Wazir, who was second in command to Palestine LiberationOrganization chief Yasser Arafat.   Israeli sources have confirmed that Israeli commandos shot andkilled al-Wazir at his home in a Tunis suburb. The nation's leadershave so far refused to comment.   NBC television reported Monday that Mossad agents, naval andarmy commandos carried out the assassination, reaching their targetby sea.   The report said the operation was approved at a Cabinet meetinglast week, with two dissenters, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres andCabinet Minister Ezer Weizman.   In an interview with Israel radio today, Weizman, a formerdefense minister, refused to comment on whether Israel onducted theassassination, but said:   ``It doesn't contribute to the fight against terrorism. Inprinciple it creates more. It distances the peace process and willbring greater hostility and make us more vulnerable around theworld.''   Al-Wazir's body was flown to Syria today. His funeral isscheduled for Wednesday.   Israel's military censor, meanwhile, took a rare step andcensored an entire editorial by the mass-circulation Yediot Ahronotdaily which newspaper sources said dealt with Israel's role inAl-Wazir's killing.   The editorial appeared as a blank white space with only a titlethat read: ``They Are Silent But Speak.'' Dov Yudkovsky, thenewspaper's editor, declined to comment on the action.   Also today, the Israeli-appointed mayor of Nablus, Hafez Tuqan,declined to comment on media reports that he planned to resign fromhis post because of the 4{-month-long uprising in the territoriesIsrael occupied in the 1967 Middle East War.   A leaflet published this month by the pro-PLO underground calledon Tuqan and other Israeli-appointed municipal officials to leavetheir jobs.   Tuqan stepped in as Nablus mayor in March 1986 afterIsraeli-appointed Zafer Al-Masri was assassinated by pro-Syrianextremists.   Nablus, the West Bank's largest city with 120,000 residents, and16 other towns and refugee camps in the West Bank have been undercurfew since Sunday.   Jelazoun, a Palestinian refugee camp near the city of Ramallah,has been under curfew for 34 days, the longest curfew on a campsince the uprising began Dec. 8.   Soldiers initially barred even United Nations relief officialsfrom delivering food to the camp's 5,000 residents.   But today, the army allowed three relief trucks carryingsardines, corned beef, beans, cooking oil, powdered milk and riceto enter the camp, according to Bill Lee, a spokesman for the U.N.Relief and Works Agency.</TEXT></DOC>
