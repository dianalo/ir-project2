Supervisor Kenneth Hahn has proposed a ban on the sale andpossession of the military-style rifles in unincorporated areas ofLos Angeles County. An anticipated vote was delayed, however,because one supervisor was ill.   Meanwhile, in Olympia, Wash., a Republican state senator whostrongly opposes gun controls bowed Tuesday to demands that the Lawand Justice Committee he heads consider restrictions on ownership ofsemi-automatic weapons. Sen. Kent Pullen said he will hold a hearingnext Tuesday, but would wait for public response before decidingwhether to hold a committee vote.   Several California cities have banned the guns and statelawmakers have begun considering action since a man with an assaultrifle killed five children and wounded 29 others and a teacher at aStockton school Jan. 17.   Although the vote was delayed two weeks, the county Board ofSupervisors listened to testimony about the victims of shootings.   The Rev. Guy Wilson, pastor of Our Lady of Victory Church inCompton, said that last year he lost 13 parishioners to gunfire inthe gang-ridden south central Los Angeles area. He brought with himthe children of one victim, Rosalinda Cisneros, 28, who was slain byan assault weapon 18 months ago.   ``The Cisneros family, the five children here with me, they sawtheir mother gunned down,'' Wilson said.   ``The mother had in her arms her 4-week-old child. When she heardthe shooting, she turned to protect the child, and she herself tookthe shot through the heart and died,'' Wilson said.   He said the father was so traumatized he turned to drink and isnow in prison for an alcohol-related offense. The five children nowlive with another family who have eight children of their own,Wilson said.   Brian Baker, a member of the National Rifle Association, arguedagainst a ban. ``The issue is being touted as a law and orderconcern, but I feel we're seeing a cynical attempt to accomplish ...total gun confiscation,'' he said.   Under the proposal, the assault rifles could still be owned bymuseums, licensed dealers, law enforcement agencies and the military.   The cities of Stockton, Los Angeles, Carson and Compton haveenacted bans on semiautomatic assault rifles, and one was proposedMonday in San Diego.   Colt Industries Inc. filed a federal lawsuit in Los Angeles onMonday, saying the city's new law banning sales of semiautomaticrifles will cause the firm financial harm and hurt its image. Theweapons company makes the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, which isincluded under the law.</TEXT></DOC>
