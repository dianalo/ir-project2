The company was to repay $58 million in debt on Dec. 31 and $15 million on March 31. The company acquired the debt when it paid $155 million to purchase Wilson last year.    An agreement to sell the Wilson assets for $150 million in cash and notes collapsed in late September, when the buyer, a company controlled by George Gillett, couldn't secure financing. </TEXT></DOC>
