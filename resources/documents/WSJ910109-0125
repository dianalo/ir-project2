Instead, the guerrillas, who are led by apro-Castro, renegade Spanish priest, blow up the pipelineconnecting Colombia's billion-barrel Cano Limon oil field tothe sea.   They struck once again Monday night, starting a fire thatburned an unknown quantity of crude and yesterday halted thecountry's principal conduit for what has become its mostimportant export.</LP><TEXT>   Since 1986, the guerrillas, or elenos as they are calledfrom the movement's initials, have on 138 occasions dynamitedthe pipeline, which snakes its way 490 miles through densejungle, swamps and two mountain ranges. In 1988, theyaveraged one explosion a week. Last year, they blew up thepipeline, operated by Ecopetrol, the state oil company, 23times.   &quot;We hold the {world} record,&quot; says the pipeline's manager,Fernando Gutierrez. Rafael Pardo, the chief national securityadviser to President Cesar Gaviria calls the elenos &quot;thebiggest threat today to Colombia's petroleum industry.&quot;   In the past three years, the bombings have spilled morethan 630,000 barrels, or 26 million gallons, of crude inrivers, lakes, and swamps -- nearly three times the amountspilled in the Exxon Valdez accident in Alaska. Mr. Gutierrezestimates that the clean-up, repairs, spilt oil, and,especially, lost production, have cost Ecopetrol and its twopartners, the Colombian units of Occidental Petroleum Corp.and Royal Dutch/Shell Group, more than $723 million.(Occidental and Shell share 40% of the oil from Cano Limon.)   The elenos don't like the government's policy of grantingconcessions to foreign oil companies. In particular, theydon't like Occidental Petroleum, whose gleaming Bogotaheadquarters, patrolled by shotgun-toting guards, was heavilydamaged by a bomb nearly three years ago. &quot;Better the oilstay in Colombia than for multinationals to take it out ofthe country,&quot; the guerrillas' leader, Manuel Perez, said in arare interview three years ago.   Most of the time, the pipeline is up and running 24 to 48hours after an attack. But sometimes a series of explosionsknocks it out for three to five days. When guerrillas overranthe station at the port of Covenas, the pipeline was out for16 days.   The attacks cast a pall on the future of the country's oilindustry, which wants more foreign investment. Oil last yearsurpassed coffee as the country's leading export earner,bringing in $1.3 billion in the first 10 months. But thecountry needs to increase exploration, because without newreserves Colombia will become a net oil importer by 1996. Mr.Perez, a bespectacled, grey-bearded, soft-spoken Spanishpriest, is the guerrillas' unlikely mastermind. Mr. Perezlanded in Colombia in 1965 in the heady days after Cuba'srevolution. He has been in the mountains fighting thegovernment since 1969.   In these days of perestroika, Mr. Perez's guerrillas arean ideological fossil. In Colombia, which last year elected apresident intent on privatizing state companies, most otherguerrilla groups, with the exception of the RevolutionaryArmed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the nation's oldest andlargest guerrilla force, have put down their arms. But theestimated 2,000 elenos now account for about half of allguerrilla actions in Colombia.   In recent months the elenos have expanded their economicwar to other industries, most spectacularly forestry andpaper products. In August, they burnt down about 260 acres ofpine forest 67%-owned by the big Irish printing and packagingcompany Jefferson Smurfit PLC.   Few believe the elenos can reach their goal ofoverthrowing the Colombian government. Still, says MariaJimena Duzan, a columnist for the El Espectador newspaper,&quot;Being a relatively small group, they can play a veryimportant destabilizing role in the economy.&quot;   Colombian military men and government officials blame thegrowth of the guerrilla threat largely on the companies thatbuilt the oil pipeline, in particular a unit of MannesmannAG, a West German construction company.   In 1983, Occidental's Colombian unit struck a gusher inArauca, a largely uninhabited, swampy region near theVenezuelan frontier. To get the oil out quickly, Occidentalneeded a pipeline fast. It awarded a $172 million contract toMannesmann to build a 176-mile leg. At the time, only about50 elenos had survived earlier purges and battles with themilitary. But they soon found, say government and militaryofficials, that in response to kidnappings and extortioncontractors, Mannesmann in particular, became cash cows.   In 1984, a Mannesmann engineer and two assistants werekidnapped and ransomed for a hefty fee. From then on, saygovernment officials, Mannesmann paid the guerrillasprotection money. A 1985 report in Frankfurt AllgemeineZeitung, a German newspaper, estimated that Mannesmann paidthe guerrillas a total of 15 million marks ($9.8 million).   Andres Londono, Ecopetrol's president, says that while hehas no proof of wrongdoing by any particular company, it is&quot;a recognized fact&quot; that Occidental's pipeline subcontractorsin their rush to quickly finish the pipeline &quot;sowed this evilthat now afflicts us&quot; by caving in to demands for money. Now,says Mr. Pardo, the national security adviser, the elenosboast they have a $50 million war chest, obtained from &quot;wartaxes&quot; paid by oil companies and from the ransoms paid byother kidnap victims. Some Colombian officials suspect thatMannesmann passed on the guerrillas' bill to Occidental.   Mannesmann, in a written response, refused to comment. ButMannesmann has noted that it built bridges and suppliedhospitals with generators in the regions where it worked togird the people &quot;against attacks and control by guerrillas.&quot;   In the past, Occidental has strongly denied accusations byColombian officials that it, too, paid off guerrillas.Richard Ray, Occidental's former maintenance superintendentfor heavy equipment and civil works in Cano Limon, says hedidn't see the company make any cash payments to guerrillas.But, he adds, Occidental built schools, roads and hospitalswhenever guerrillas requested.   ---   Fred Kempe in Berlin contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
