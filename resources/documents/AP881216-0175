The Federal Open Market Committee, which establishes monetarypolicy for the central bank, voted 11-1 on Nov. 1 to leave policyunchanged for the time being.   But, in a directive to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, thecommittee said ``somewhat greater reserve restraint might beacceptable'' depending on inflation and the strength of the economyand called for ``remaining especially alert to potentialdevelopments that might require some firming'' of monetary policy.   The New York bank buys and sells government securities owned bybanks to drain or swell the amount of reserves the banks have tomake loans, and thus influence the price, or interest rate on thoseloans.   The Fed, whose main job is to guard against inflation, is seekingto slow the growth of the economy as measured by the gross nationalproduct from the 3 percent to 3.5 percent range to a level itconsider sustainable without inflation, between 2 percent to 2.5percent.   In late March, it began a series of credit tightening moves,culminating in August with a one-half percentage point increase to6.5 percent in its discount rate, the interest it charges to makebank loans.   Economic statistics for August and September led some economiststo conclude that the policy was succeeding in dampening the economy.But figures for October and November show a rebound. Unemployment isnear a 14-year low and factories are using more of their capacitythan at any time in nine years, a development economists say couldlead to shortages and price increases.   Market participants say it became clear this week that the Feddecided to begin nudging interest rates higher again. The federalfunds rate, the rate at which banks make overnight loans amongthemselves, rose from about 8.4 percent on Tuesday to 8.9 percentFriday.   Consumer rates have responded by also heading higher. Fixed-ratemortgages, not including special add-on fees known as points,averaged 10.71 percent this week, matching the high for the year.One-year, adjustable-rate mortgages, at 8.43 percent, were thehighest in 14 months.   In November, the minutes said, ``a majority of the (Fedcommittee) members believed that operations should be adjusted morereadily toward further tightening than toward any easing,'' althoughsome of the members going along with the directive ``were lessinclined than they had been previously to bias it toward furtherrestraint.''   Fed Gov. Martha Seger, who cast the only dissenting vote, saidunchanged policy was acceptable to her but she ``did not want tobias the directive toward potential tightening,'' the minutes said.   ``In her view,'' they said, ``current indications of slowereconomic growth ... pointed to ... reduced inflationary pressuresover the year ahead.''   The open market committee met again this week to discuss monetarypolicy. The minutes of that meeting won't be released until afterthe next meeting on Feb. 7-8. The committee is composed of theseven-member Federal Reserve Board and five of the 12 presidents ofthe Fed's district banks.</TEXT></DOC>
