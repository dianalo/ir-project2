The action, which comes in the wake of data showing thatthe problem is worse than was believed, reflects a timetablethat producers and users of the substances generally accept.&quot;We think we can live with it,&quot; said Joseph McGuire, seniorvice president of the Air Conditioning and RefrigerationInstitute. &quot;We think it's doable.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   U.S. production of chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs, which arewidely used in refrigerants and solvents, and other chemicalsthat destroy the stratospheric ozone layer, will have to beeliminated by Dec. 31, 1995, four years sooner than requiredunder an international treaty. Limited exceptions will beallowed for certain medical equipment such as dose inhalersfor asthmatics and other essential uses and for the servicingof existing equipment. The president also is urging producersto cut output to 50% of 1986 levels by year end.   Partly because of a U.S. tax on CFC production, output is42% below 1986 levels, as industry has found it easier thanexpected to come up with safer substitutes.   Last week, the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration released scientific data that showed recordlevels of the chemicals over the Northern Hemisphere andsuggested an increasing likelihood that a dangerous thinningof the ozone layer will develop over densely populated areas.The ozone layer is crucial for shielding the Earth fromultraviolet radiation, which leads to increased skin cancerand crop damage.   Environmental groups supported the president's action, butsaid it falls short of what is needed. Liz Cook, ozonecampaign director at Friends of the Earth, said, &quot;We're gladthe president recognized the ozone problem is a globalemergency. But we think the crisis is so dire that we willcontinue to press for the U.S. to eliminate allozone-depleting chemicals sooner than the deadline.&quot;   The accelerated phase-out applies to major CFCs, halons,methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. Under the 1990revisions to the Clean Air Act, the administration hasauthority to accelerate the phase-out of these chemicals whendata indicate a need to do so.   The president also announced that the U.S. will re-examinethe phase-out schedule for hydrochlorofluorocarbons, aless-damaging substitute for CFCs, and will consider evidenceon another chemical, methyl bromide, which isn't covered bythe treaty. Environmental Protection Agency AdministratorWilliam Reilly said the EPA plans to propose phasing out themore damaging HCFCs by 2005, with exceptions made for theservicing of existing equipment until 2015.</TEXT></DOC>
