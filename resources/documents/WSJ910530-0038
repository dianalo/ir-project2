Mr. Bush's plan would ban chemical and biological weapons,end sales and production of surface-to-surface missiles andblock the introduction of new nuclear weapons to the region,while also putting some curbs on the sale of conventionalarms. To work, it would require both an unprecedented degreeof restraint among arms producers and a level of trust amongMiddle East nations that has never been seen before.</LP><TEXT>   The proposal is certain to set off sparks in U.S.relations with Israel. Though it doesn't single out Israel,it would have the effect of requiring Jerusalem to end itsproduction of nuclear weapons. And Israeli officials havemade clear they think the arms-control effort should focusmore heavily on stopping the flow of conventional weapons,rather than specialized arms.   Mr. Bush's plan also could conflict eventually with hisadministration's desire to continue selling some advancedarms to U.S. allies in the region, particularly Egypt andSaudi Arabia, as well as Israel.   Still, Mr. Bush's aides said they hope that the shock ofIraq's invasion of Kuwait will prompt countries in and out ofthe region to surmount such obstacles. And they note thatsuch leaders as British Prime Minister John Major, CanadianPrime Minister Brian Mulroney and Egyptian President HosniMubarak already are pushing the idea of arms control for theregion, improving the chances for progress.   The president unveiled his proposal, his latest effort tocapitalize on the U.S.-led victory in the war against Iraq,in a commencement speech here at the Air Force Academy. Itwas described in more detail later by administrationofficials.   &quot;Halting the proliferation of conventional andunconventional weapons in the Middle East, while supportingthe legitimate need of every state to defend itself, willrequire the cooperation of many states in the region andaround the world,&quot; Mr. Bush said. &quot;It won't be easy, but thepath to peace never is.&quot;   Specifically, Mr. Bush's plan calls for:   -- A meeting soon of representatives of the U.S., Britain,France, the Soviet Union and China to develop a plan to endsales of &quot;destabilizing&quot; conventional arms to the MiddleEast. Those five countries are the biggest suppliers ofconventional arms to the region. Mr. Bush's plan envisionsthat they agree on a system of regular meetings andconsultations on pending arms sales.   -- A freeze on the sale, production and testing of allsurface-to-surface missiles in the region. The plan envisionsthat this freeze would lead to &quot;the ultimate elimination ofsuch missiles&quot; from existing arsenals.   -- A verifiable ban on the production and acquisition ofweapons-capable nuclear material. Countries in the regionalso will be urged to sign the Nuclear Non-ProliferationTreaty and accept International Atomic Energy Agencysafeguards at all nuclear facilities. The plan supports &quot;theeventual creation of a regional nuclear weapon-free zone.&quot;   -- A commitment by countries in the region to join anexisting international agreement banning biological weaponsand to participate in attempts to negotiate a global ban onchemical weapons.   Administration officials said they haven't decided whetherthe president's ideas should lead to a sweeping arms-controltreaty, a series of narrower agreements or less formalunderstandings. They said an initial meeting of the five bigconventional arms suppliers is to be held soon in Paris,though China and the Soviet Union haven't specifically agreedto attend.   The provisions on nuclear arms and missile production arelikely to trouble Israel. Though Israel doesn't officiallyacknowledge possessing nuclear weapons, it is known to havecovertly developed an arsenal of such arms and is believed tobe the only country in the region to possess them. WhileIsrael would be glad to see a halt to attempts by its Arabenemies to develop their own nuclear arsenals, Israelileaders aren't eager to stop their own nuclear-arms programor to sign the non-proliferation treaty and acceptinternational atomic safeguards, as Mr. Bush's planenvisions. And Israel, which has long counted on its nucleararms to help offset far bigger combined Arab armies, alsowon't easily accept the notion of making the Middle East anuclear weapons-free zone.   Similarly, the proposed end to missile development wouldhalt programs Israel has considered important to its defense.</TEXT></DOC>
