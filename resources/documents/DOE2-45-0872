In February 1987,the GCDT was turned over to the direction of Dr. R.K. Schulz for tritiummigration studies, after the completion of the in-situ tracer gas experiment.Two things were studied: the migration of tritium oxide in all directionsaround the waste and tritium oxide transport to the atmosphere from thecentral borehole. Work to date indicates that the migration towards thesurface is predominate while the horizontal migration appears negligible.Additionally, about 10{sup {minus}10} of the buried tritium is beingreleased to the atmosphere per day; an extremely small fraction of thetotal tritium disposed. As is, indications are that the GCDT is a verygood disposal facility. Modifications of the backfill and capping procedureduring closure are expected to raise the performance even higher. 4 refs.,15 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
