Down near thetitanium mine a gaggle of clattering tanks is kicking up a cloud ofwhite dust. A column of ``rat patrol'' jeeps with machine-gunnersstanding at their mounted M-60s bounces through the palmetto andscrub brush.   The Gator Brigade, trained in the jungles of Central America todefend the Panama Canal, is back in camp.   It's one of the refurbished National Guard combat units preparedto go to battle within days, part of a strike force of statemilitias learning to fight in foreign lands, 58 different countriesin the past year in fact, from Panama to Saudi Arabia, from Koreato West Germany.   Not since Bunker Hill has America's oldest military force beencounted on so heavily to provide a first line of defense. Never inits 352-year history, most military authorities agree, has theNational Guard been stronger, better equipped, better trained inpeacetime.   Spec. 4 Jeff Cleveland is flat on his belly at the firing range,polishing his marksmanship with the M-60, the machine gun he calls``your primary killing weapon.''   ``I'd go into battle with these guys in a heartbeat,'' saysCleveland, 22, who recently joined the Guard after he finished athree-year hitch in the Army and returned to Stuart to help run hisfamily's nursery. ``They know what they're doing. These weapons arein better shape than we had in Korea and you're a lot closer to theenemy in Korea.''   The National Guard traces its heritage to the formation of threeregiments in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1636. It hastraditionally had a dual role as a state militia commanded by thegovernor and as part of the national defense force.   Today, with the Guard playing a greater role in nationaldefense, many officials are concerned about the home front. In casethe Guard is mobilized for federal duty, 23 states, plus PuertoRico and the District of Columbia, have organized State DefenseForces available to help out in emergencies such as naturaldisasters and civil disturbances, like the Home Guard of World WarI and the State Guard of World War II. In event of all-out war,they would also be available to guard hydrolectric dams, nuclearplants and communications installations.   The structure and strength of the State Defense Forces varieswidely from state to state, ranging from largely socialorganizations whose members are not allowed to carry guns and mustbuy their own uniforms, to serious military organizations withstrict training requirements. None of the defense force members,mostly retired military personnel, is paid.   There is considerable debate over just how much control, if any,the Defense Department should have and who should pay the bills.Ninety-five percent of the Air and Army Guard's annual $9 billionbudget is federal money.   Back in the woods at Camp Blanding is a command tent hidden by acamouflage net and guarded by coils of razor wire. A sentry with anM-16 rifle demands the password. There Judge Richard G. Weinberg isholding court in battle dress, the new German-style Kevlar helmeton his head, his face smeared with black-and-green greasepaint.He's also wearing the star of a brigadier general as commander ofthe 4,300 troops of the 53rd Infantry Brigade, the Gator Brigade.   The Gator Brigade is one of the National Guard units that trainregularly in Central America, a practice that has drawn objections,even lawsuits, from several state governors who contend that thestate militia should not be used as a tool of U.S. foreign policy.But some units of the 53rd have been undergoing annual two-weektraining in Latin America since 1972, mostly in Panama but also inHonduras, Ecuador, Peru and elsewhere.   Weinberg, a circuit judge from St. Augustine and veteran of the82nd Airborne and the Special Forces, figures he has been to Panamaabout 20 times over the past five years and knows the terrain``like the back of my hand.''   ``Should hostilities break out in Panama, we could deploy therein three to four days,'' he says. ``And if you have to mobilize andphysically go to those regions in an emergency, it's a lot betterto train by actually loading the aircraft and moving out as opposedto practicing it at an armory somewhere.''   Send the National Guard into battle on foreign soil in three tofour days?   That's the Pentagon's Total Force battle plan which puts theNational Guard and the Reserves in ``full partnership'' with theregular Army and Air Force, counted on to provide about half themanpower in a war. Some Guard combat units would be on the frontlines within a few days, with the rest to follow within 30 to 60days. Some units would reach the battlefield even before theirregular Army partners.   ``It was not but a few years ago that they said we couldn'tfight our way out of a paper bag, and here we're on the spearheadof an invasion,'' says Lt. Gen. Herbert R. Temple Jr., chief of theNational Guard Bureau, the liaison with the Defense Department.``Baby, we've come a long way.''   Half a million National Guard troops have trained overseas inthe past few years, at an average of 40,000 to 50,000 a year, manyparticipating with the regular Army in such exercises as Reforgerin Europe and Team Spirit in South Korea.   They are doing such things as building roads and supplyingmedical care in Central America and flying airlifts to the SouthPole. A team of selected volunteers from the Gator Brigade wentthrough a French commando school in Martinique this summer. Duringa Reforger exercise, a signal brigade from Florida opened up a lineof military communications across Belgium, the first time that hasbeen done since World War II.
