It is unusual for a U.S. company to be involved in such alarge-scale construction project in Japan because of officialand unofficial trade barriers. But some experts believe thenumber will increase.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;You'll see more and more of this,&quot; predicted Gail Arch,professor of international management at the University ofHouston. &quot;As we're coming into an election year, we'll behaving a terrific push by the Bush administration to open upthe Japanese market.&quot;   Brown andamp; Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton Co., receivedthe contract from Sanpo Land Industrial Co., a closely heldreal estate company in Tokyo. In New York Stock Exchange latetrading yesterday, Halliburton shares were quoted at $33.25,off 12.5 cents. News of the contract was first reported in anarticle in yesterday's Washington Post.   Brown andamp; Root is a long-established internationalconstruction company, but this contract is its first inJapan. &quot;It is of great significance because it is a majorcontract in that country,&quot; an enthusiastic Halliburtonspokesman said. &quot;It may be the most signficant project landedby a {U.S.} engineering and construction firm in Japan.&quot;   The company said the project is planned to include a yachtharbor, luxury condominiums, an international marketplace,restaurants, recreational facilities, an aquarium, theaters,two golf courses, hotels and an airport. In addition, 2,100acres now under shallow water will be reclaimed, anddeep-water areas will be used for water activities, thespokesman said.   The project is slated for the southern end of NagashimaIsland in upper Ise Bay, near Nagoya. At this point, Brown andamp;Root said it has begun a feasibility study to prepare fordevelopment of the resort.   While the spokesman said &quot;there would likely be manysubcontracts for specific items,&quot; he said he couldn't be morespecific about how much of the $7 billion project will staywith Brown andamp; Root. Typically in such a large constructionproject the revenues are widely spread. The spokesmandeclined to comment on how and from where the resort will befinanced.   Individuals in Tokyo familiar with the project said SanpoLand will have to obtain prefectural and national permits,which probably would entail negotiations with localfishermen. Fishermen in Japan have often forced projects tobe scaled down or have demanded huge compensation in returnfor their approval.</TEXT></DOC>
