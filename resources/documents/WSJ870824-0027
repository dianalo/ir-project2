Neither Taft nor Silver Star, which owns five radio stations, would disclose the price.    Taft already owns 15 radio stations, mainly in the Midwest, and seven television stations. WRIF is a rock station, a format with which Taft &quot;has had a great deal of experience and success,&quot; said Charles S. Mechem Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;We are actively seeking other properties that fit our specific criteria.&quot;    Taft shareholders are scheduled to vote Sept. 29 on a proposed leveraged buy-out of the company, which sources close to the buyers said probably will be followed by a breakup of the company. In addition to broadcasting, Taft is involved in cable TV, TV programming and distribution, and movie production.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company. </TEXT></DOC>
