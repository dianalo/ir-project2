Within 24 hours after the events, high-signalareas were detected in 13 of the 15 cases by the use of T/sub 2/-weightedimages. The high-signal areas were noted in two out of three cases evenwithin 3 hours, and in one out of two within six hours, after the cerebrovascularaccidents, whereas no abnormalities were noted by conventional CT scanswithin the same times. There was a tendency for the high-signal areasto be localized in the cortical and deep gray matter within 24 hoursand to extend into the deep white matter during the following 24 hours.It was suggested that the localization of high-signal areas in the graymatter in the early ischemic phase could be due to cytotoxic edema andthat there was a different vulnerability to ischemia between gray andwhite matter. At 2 weeks after the accidents, a ''fogging effect'' wasnoted in five out of the eight cases which were sequentially evaluatedby MRI. MRI was superior to CT scan in the visualization of this ''foggingeffect''. All of the 5 cases with cortical-subcortical infarctions showedthe ''fogging effect'', whereas 3 cases with deep gray matter infarctions,in which the collateral circulation was poor angiographically, did notshow such a phenomenon. The CT scans revealed no findings which suggesteda hemorrhagic infarction in any of the 5 cases with the ''fogging effect''.These findings suggested that the ''fogging effect'' could representthe reflow phenomenon from collateral circulations.</TEXT></DOC>
