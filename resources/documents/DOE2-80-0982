These accidents may result in fatalitiesor less serious injuries and sometimes only in serious disruption toplant and process. Undoubtedly there is risk in mining but the conceptof acceptability of risk is false and dangerous. Technical solutionsare currently available which if adopted can substantially reduce accidents.Any technical solution applied should be based on a rationale that itsuse will have maximum effect in reducing overall number of fatalitiesin the industry. Risk rationalization in relation to fatalities willbe equally as effective in reducing accidents generating less seriousinjuries and thereby contributing to efficiency and productivity of theindustry. 12 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
