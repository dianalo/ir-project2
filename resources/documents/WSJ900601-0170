Congressional sponsors of the new bill want to overrideseveral recent Supreme Court decisions that they say weakenthe 1964 Civil Rights Act banning employment discrimination.But small-business groups argue that the bill would, ineffect, require hiring quotas, which they say would hurtfirms with fewer workers; they focus their lobbying onPresident Bush, who has said he won't sign a &quot;quota&quot; bill.</LP><TEXT>   They also oppose a change that would add punitive damagesfor intentional discrimination. An amendment by Missouri GOPSen. John Danforth revising some terms &quot;doesn't begin tosolve the problem,&quot; says Nancy Fulco, human resourcesattorney for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.   Compared with the current law, the language of the newbill would make it harder for an employer to prove that itshiring process is fair, says John Galles, executive vicepresident of National Small Business United. But an aide toSen. Danforth says the new wording simply summarizes theessence of earlier civil rights case law. And as for damages,Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conferenceon Civil Rights, adds: &quot;We've said from the beginning thatthis bill has two purposes: to overturn five Supreme Courtdecisions and to add monetary damages for intentionaldiscrimination.&quot;   The bill's backers deny that the legislation wouldeffectively mandate quotas and accuse opponents of trying todelay passage.   ---   CLEAN AIR COMPROMISES by the House make small firmsbreathe easier.   Small business won two important amendments in the cleanair bill passed last week by the House. One amendment wouldenable a small business to reduce emissions by usingreformulated chemicals or operating at different hoursinstead of simply buying costly anti-pollution equipment.Another would let companies apply for one emissions permit intheir home state, which then would automatically seek theU.S. Environmental Protection Agency's approval. The originalbill required seeking separate permits from the home state,all contiguous states and the federal government.   The separate clean air bill passed earlier by the Senatesays the states should decide permit issues. But &quot;if Congressdoesn't take care of this now, they'll have to come back andfix it within a year, like kids coming back to do extra workafter school,&quot; says Christian Braunlich, director of theNational Association of Manufacturers' small manufacturers'forum.   Small furniture manufacturers are relieved that the Housemeasure also would require states to give small concernstechnical compliance information. The American FurnitureManufacturers Association says that because of California'sair-quality rules, its industry has lost about 2,000 of the14,000 jobs it once had in Southern California.   A House-Senate conference will iron out differencesbetween the two bills. Small-business lobbyists believe thefavorable House provisions will be retained in the finalclean air package sent to President Bush.   ---   IT'S A MYTH that small businesses create most of thenation's jobs, three economists argue in a new book,&quot;Employers Large and Small,&quot; (Harvard University Press). Thebook, by Harvard's James Medoff and James Hamilton andUniversity of Michigan's Charles Brown, seeks to debunk thetheory, prominently espoused by economist and consultantDavid Birch, that most job growth depends on entrepreneurs.The authors argue that when the high failure rate of smallconcerns is considered, they create jobs roughly inproportion to their share of the work force. Mr. Birchcounters that federal studies support his view that smallfirms create a disproportionate share of new jobs.   ---   A NEW CANDIDATE emerges for the Small BusinessAdministration's chief counsel for advocacy, a post vacantsince last fall. Robert Hsueh, an immigration lawyer fromTexas, has been through the rigorous government backgroundcheck and is expected to be the nominee. The Bushadministration's last nominee, educator Kyo Jhin, withdrewfrom consideration in February.   ---   BUDGET GIMMICKRY? Small firms are wary about currentfiscal talks.   &quot;There's no deficit crisis, there's a political crisis,&quot;charges Lawrence Hunter, deputy chief economist for the U.S.Chamber of Commerce. He contends that some lawmakers aretrying to scare the public with talk of a vastly moreexpensive savings and loan industry bail-out in order toraise taxes and avoid politically painful spending cuts.   Another proposal for a capital gains tax cut is expectedto come out of the summit, but it may get a lukewarmreception from small business. Such interests say very smallcompanies won't benefit from the cut, and medium-sized onesfear it will carry a price tag -- other hefty taxes. A majorworry of many small businesses: new environmental taxes,aimed at forcing companies to recycle solvents and othermaterials. &quot;All you have to do is cloak yourself in the goodflag of environmentalism and you can tax . . . all sorts ofthings,&quot; says Dirk Van Dongen, president of the NationalAssociation of Wholesaler-Distributors.   National Small Business United says its members arewilling to face some tax increases, but only if there arealso real spending cuts.   ---   SMALL TALK: Some 18% of small manufacturers surveyed thisyear by the National Association of Manufacturers said theyderive from 5% to 10% of their revenue from exports. Only 12%put exports at that level when surveyed in 1989. . . . Mad atyour computer?
