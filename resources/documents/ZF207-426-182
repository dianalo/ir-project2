Garstang, program manager for the Air Force's Identification-Friend,Foe andamp; Neutral project at Kirtaldn, said the TACCSF simulation system isalready the largest of its kind in the world.andP;  &quot;Let's put it this way,&quot;Garstang said, &quot;we don't know exactly what the Russians can do, but we knowthey don't have the [simulation] technology that we have.&quot;andM;The $135 million facility has been operating as a test bed for about 10advanced European theater warfare systems for several years now.andP;  The testsmeasure the capabilities of warfare systems to distinguish enemy targets fromfriends.andM;Another 50 MinisandM;Garstang said the simulation process is driven by 32-bit super-minis fromConcurrent Computer Corp., Tinton Falls, N.J., at three basic stages ofoperation: a pretest phase during which warfare scenarios are devised;real-time simulations where users work with computerized versions of warfaresystems; and a post-test data collection and reduction phase.andM;Each of the Concurrent 3200-series  computers has 128M of internal memory, hesaid.andP;  The system also includes 19 floating point system array processorsthat help with the simulations.andM;The computers share 8M of dynamic memory and 6 gigabytes of on-line diskstorage, Garstang said.andP;  Another 50 minis, from Ridge Computers of Milpitas,Calif., control the scenarios and perform some backup processing on F-15tests, he said.andM;&quot;They have some of the algorithms you need to simulate things likemaneuvering an aircraft,&quot; Garstang said.andP;  &quot;We have those parameters runningon the Ridge so the main suite of machines doesn't have to do all thatprocessing too.&quot;andM;Operating as a suite, the system can execute 340 million instructions persecond.andP;  Concurrent spokesman Ron Cowell said the machines are used formilitary training simulations.andM;Among the weapons simulated are Army Patriot and Hawk missiles and Air ForceF-15 jets.andP;  The Patriot operations actually are simulated at Fort Bliss,Texas, and transmitted to the Kirtland hardware suite via a secured satellitenetwork.andP;  Also simulated are radar and intelligence systems.andM;Garstang said the Office of the Secretary of Defense originlly wanted tobuild a simulation network linking the TACCSF and other existing simulatorsscattered all over the country.andM;&quot;It would have been impossible, though, because all your local area networklines are subject to peculiarities,&quot; Garstang said.andM;&quot;Plus, you've got different systems running different languages, differentoperating systems, secure systems and so forth.andP;  It just made more sense toassemble everything here at Kirtland.&quot;andM;Contracts were first issued in 1981, and software coding began in 1983,Garstang said.andP;  Logicon Inc. of Torrance, Calif., developed more than 1million lines of FORTRAN-77 code, which runs on the Concurrent's OS-32operating system and throughout the simulation system.andM;The system simulates the central European theater, Garstang said, and canreplicate geographic areas as large as 248 square miles from governmentcomputer tapes.andP;  This data comes in 100-square-meter digitally expressedcells that include topographical and what Garstang called &quot;cultrual&quot; landmass information.andM;Scenario builders at TACCSF first must piece together cells to establish atest region in which, for instance, an actual F-15 pilot will fly &quot;datamiles&quot; when a specific war tim situation is presented.andM;Garstang said the creation of a particular land mass can take as long as sixmonths of assembly and processing.andP;  A scenario that runs a two-hour testtakes about 30 hours to create, he said, which is done on a menu-drivenpretest system.andP;  Real-time tests on the simulators are overseen onlarge-screen displays in a scenario control area where, Garstang said, &quot;youget what we call a God's-eye view of the test.&quot;andM;Data reduction after the test requires up to 30 hours processing time, hesaid.andP;  An entire test comprises numerous scenarios presented to severalsubjects.andM;Data moving across the link from Fort Bliss is time-tagged, Garstang said,and the system checks to be sure there are no lags that might skew real-timeconsiderations.andM;Ultimately, test data is reduced to reflect those maneuvers, decisions orother battle factors of most interest to military officials.andM;Tech.andP;  Sgt.andP;  John Kilcoyne said the test bed will be turned over in Octoberto the control of the Air Force Tactical Air Warfare Center at Eglin airForce Base, Fla.andM;An on-site TACCSF staff will function as &quot;caretakers of the facility for thevarious military groups who want to come in and use the test bed,&quot; Kilcoynesaid.andP;  He said the Air Force expects to release a technical services requestfor proposals later this year for expect system and engineering analysis ofthe facility itself and how the military can best use it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
