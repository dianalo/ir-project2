Hunt (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG </G><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a bid for Jewish votes, Democratic Sen. Albert Gore sought to capitalize on presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis's refusal to rule out the creation of a Palestinian state.    Appearing in a debate with the Massachusetts governor and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Mr. Gore took issue with both his rivals on the Mideast question and said he opposed creation of such a separate government as part of any solution to the West Bank and Gaza crisis. The Rev. Jackson has long supported a Palestinian homeland, but when Gov. Dukakis declined this week to rule out such a plan, he left an opening the young Tennessee senator hopes to exploit going into next Tuesday's New York primary.    &quot;Mike Dukakis had three exchanges on the question of a Palestinian state and expressed a lot more enthusiasm for it than I have,&quot; Mr. Gore said yesterday in reference to remarks by the governor before Jewish leaders Monday. &quot;I don't support a Palestinian state.&quot;    Aides to Mr. Dukakis said the governor wasn't implicitly supporting such a solution but only had sought to demonstrate that the U.S. shouldn't dictate the outcome of any future negotiations in the Mideast. &quot;I didn't express enthusiasm for a Palestinian state,&quot; Mr. Dukakis answered Sen. Gore. &quot;I expressed enthusiasm for presidential leadership that will persuade Arab leaders to commit themselves to a basic proposition . . . that the people of Israel have the right to exist.&quot;    The exchange underscored the importance of the large Jewish vote, which represents about one-fourth of the electorate in this state's Democratic Primary. And though he remains the favorite, Mr. Dukakis seems to have stumbled on occasion when pressed by Mr. Gore. The senator's willingness to take a definitive position will add to pressure on his rival, and the idea of a Palestinian state with the military authority of an independent nation is an emotional issue for Israel.    &quot;I think he had the opportunity to hit a home run,&quot; said one Jewish leader familiar with Mr. Dukakis's remarks. &quot;He didn't hit a home run.&quot;    Sponsored by the Daily News, yesterday's debate was the first in a series in the final days of the New York contest. Playing to a friendly, often raucous crowd, the Rev. Jackson sparred easily with his rivals. He hopes to generate a large turnout among black and Hispanic voters to help him overcome Mr. Dukakis's lead in current polls.    The governor bluntly rejected the idea that the popular vote rather than delegate count should decide the nomination, and in a shot back at Sen. Gore said he might compete for the senator's accumulated delegates as well, assuming the Tennessean is driven from the race. &quot;Don't lick your chops too soon,&quot; answered Mr. Gore. The senator is in fact given little chance of winning here, and the competition for delegates, particularly those elected members of Congress who will serve as so-called super delegates, is a more immediate concern for the Rev. Jackson. &quot;Super delegates must not supersede super voters,&quot; he said.    Apart from his appeals to Jewish voters, Mr. Gore has sought to attract moderate, white blue-collar families by emphasizing issues such as crime. Radio ads focusing on a controversial prison furlough program in Massachusetts are being prepared, but the strategy may have limited success in a primary that traditionally draws much more liberal support than Mr. Gore's customary base.    Separately, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who has remained neutral in the contest and recently said he won't be available for a draft, said he still could endorse a candidate before the end of the presidential primaries on June 7. &quot;I believe it is extremely important to get a consensus nominee as early as possible,&quot; he said in a telephone interview, &quot;and I want to use my little influence when it matters the most.&quot;    He said that if, to take a hypothetical example, &quot;Michael (Dukakis) gets to 41%, it then may take a bunch of uncommitteds to get him to 51%. Maybe that would take place if he runs into trouble in California,&quot; which is the final primary.    He took exception to press reports that the New York contest has been divisive. &quot;All the stories that New York is the meanest, the toughest, the most Byzantine or the most Machiavellian primary . . . all are pure stereotypes,&quot; he declared.    In response to questions, he acknowledged that New York Mayor Edward Koch's criticism of the Rev. Jackson as insensitive to Jewish interests was controversial. But, he said: &quot;Why don't you note the utter lack of support these remarks have received in the political community and among Jewish leaders?&quot; He added that &quot;these tensions are being fed only by David Garth (Sen. Gore's media adviser) and the New York Post.&quot;    Mr. Cuomo said the winner of next week's New York primary will emerge in &quot;absolutely good shape.&quot; The Democratic governor insisted that he isn't bothered by some press criticism of his political role -- he hasn't backed a candidate and has left the impression with some politicians that he desired a stalemate so he could be the nominee -- but is puzzled by it. &quot;I see where I was called an inveterate schemer,&quot; he noted, referring to a mention of him in a Wall Street Journal story yesterday. &quot;I wonder, why would anyone say that?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
