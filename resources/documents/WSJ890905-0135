The severance program follows a crew accord reached last month between Central of Georgia and the United Transportation Union. That agreement allowed Central of Georgia to immediately cut freight-train crews to three workers and through attrition to two, leaving just engineer and conductor. Currently, freight trains on the line -- and through much of the railroad industry -- still operate with four crew members: engineer, conductor and two trainmen.    The program would pay active train-service employees whose applications for severance are accepted a $100,000 separation allowance and certain medical-care coverage. About 400 Central of Georgia employees are eligible for separation, and their applications for voluntary severance are due by Sept. 15. Norfolk Southern isn't yet sure how many will apply for the buy-out and how many it will accept.    The separation allowance includes a one-time $50,000 payment to each Central of Georgia conductor, trainman and switchman in exchange for elimination of annual productivity-fund payments provided by a previous agreement. The program also allows a $10,000 death benefit for those employees separating who will reach age 55 by Sept. 30.    Analysts said Norfolk Southern's crew-reduction efforts are part of the industry's growing commitment to shed costly work practices and become more competitive with trucks. In the past year, major railroads CSX Corp. of Richmond, Va., Union Pacific Corp. of Bethlehem, Pa., and Santa Fe Pacific Corp., Chicago, have announced agreements to pare some freight-train crews.    &quot;Competitive reality is sinking in,&quot; says Andras Petery, analyst at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. Crew-reduction programs &quot;will eventually lead to more jobs in the railroad industry because more railroads will be price competitive in merchandise freight with trucks than they are today.&quot;    Some railroads that have reduced train crews in recent years have seen savings eroded by payments to so-called productivity funds distributed to remaining crew members. Norfolk Southern's agreement with Central of Georgia train-service workers &quot;gives each employee $50,000 up front, which is expensive,&quot; in exchange for elimination of annual productivity payments, said Graeme Lidgerwood, analyst at First Boston Corp. &quot;But then every year Norfolk Southern will have the full benefit of reduced crews.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
