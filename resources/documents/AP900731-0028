A metallic object that could be by the 10-by-10-foot door wasfound wedged in the ocean floor Monday in 15,000 feet of water 90miles south of Honolulu, near where the Boeing 747 ripped open lastyear, said Lt. Cmdr. Bob Anderson.   The sub's sonar located the debris, but searchers were unable toget a picture with the sub's video camera to help confirm whetherthe debris is from Flight 811, he said.   Searchers aboard a 224-foot Navy tug recorded the location andwere to return to Honolulu today, Anderson said.   The Navy will report the find to the National TransportationSafety Board, which will decide whether to try to recover thedebris, he said.   The jumbo jet carried 355 passengers when it left Honolulu forNew Zealand on Feb. 24, 1989.   Shortly after takeoff, a cargo door opened at 22,000 feet,tearing away a section of fuselage. Nine people were swept to theirdeaths and five others suffered serious injuries. The crew managedto return the jet to Honolulu.   The NTSB inquiry determined that faulty design of the lockingmechanism probably caused a cockpit light to falsely indicate thedoor was locked.   It blamed United, Boeing Co. and the Federal AviationAdministration for failing to correct problems with the door.   The NTSB asked the Navy to find the door in hopes an examinationof it would lead to better plane safety.   The search began Wednesday. The Orion submarine searched 24square miles of the ocean floor.</TEXT></DOC>
