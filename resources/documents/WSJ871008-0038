John F. Welch Jr., chairman, said the big entertainment, equipment and financial services company, based in Fairfield, Conn., continues to expect &quot;an excellent year&quot; in 1987.    Net for the quarter rose to $703 million, or 77 cents a share, from $604 million, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier, adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split in April. Sales rose 1%, to $9.40 billion from $9.28 billion. However, GE said that after adjusting for sales of RCA businesses disposed of since the year-earlier quarter -- such as the records and carpets businesses -- sales rose 5%.    Mr. Welch said earnings in most other key areas &quot;were better on improved profit margins, reflecting the comprehensive productivity programs we have been implementing.&quot;    Although the market generally declined yesterday, General Electric shares closed at $61.375, up $1.625, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume exceeded two million shares.    The 16% earnings gain follows similar increases for the first and second quarter -- results &quot;pretty much as expected across the board. Businesses that have been strong all year continue to be strong,&quot; declared Gail Landis, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co.    She noted that the third quarter was the first with an &quot;apples-to-apples&quot; comparison with a year earlier, following the acquisition of RCA Corp. &quot;Divestiture of low-return businesses helped improve the operating margin to 9.4% from 8% in the third quarter last year. Clearly they are getting some of the costs out,&quot; she said.    Ms. Landis noted that GE in the quarter had a restructuring provision equal to $54 million, or about three cents a share, related to its appliance business and certain consumer lines.    For the fourth quarter, she is expecting net of about $1 a share, which she said is somewhat higher than the consensus projection. A 16% gain for the quarter, in line with this year's pattern, would produce earnings of about 94 cents a share, she noted. &quot;The issue really is what they do in terms of restructuring charges.&quot; She said the National Football League players strike won't have a significant impact on GE's National Broadcasting Co. unit. &quot;NBC is doing fine,&quot; she said.    GE said its financial services earnings in the quarter were &quot;substantially ahead&quot; of the year earlier, while the materials businesses had sharply higher operating profit. The plastics business continues to penetrate new markets, GE said.    Aircraft engine operating profit was &quot;considerably higher&quot; on a much higher volume of shipments. And technical products operating profit was up sharply despite somewhat lower revenue.    Power systems operating profit rose from the year-earlier quarter -- which included substantial restructuring costs -- on slightly higher revenue. Consumer products operating profit was about the same as the year before. Major appliance operating profit was lower because of restructuring costs, while industrial products profit was down slightly, reflecting continued softness in industrial markets. Aerospace operating profit was lower, &quot;principally reflecting the timing of contract deliveries,&quot; GE said.    Nine-month net income rose 16%, to $2.05 billion, or $2.24 a share, from $1.76 billion, or an adjusted $1.93 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 19%, to $27.28 billion from $22.94 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
