What's the difference betweena workstation and a &quot;super&quot; workstation?andM;The Hewlett-Packard HP 9000 Model 835 Superworkstation (there's that wordagain) is a good example of what the word &quot;superworkstation&quot; describes.andM;Hewlett-Packard has used its new Precision Architecture CPU design as thecore of the Model 835.andP;  The machine resides firmly in the high end ofworkstation computing, a realm populated by boxes from such power workstationvendors as Silicon Graphics, Ardent, Stellar and HP's recent acquisition,Apollo Computer.andM;HP's Precision Architecture design, which combines features of RISC withelements of more traditional CPU designs, is aimed at use in single-usermachines (such as technical workstations) and general multiuser systems aswell.andP;  It's designed to be implemented with several technologies for a rangeof performance and price, and to use existing hardware and softwarecomponents.andM;This CPU is the same one found in the HP 9000 Series 800 and 900 multiusercomputer systems, but the Model 835 couples that power with one of threegraphics options: the CHX for two-dimensional graphics, or the SRX orTurboSRX for three-dimensional solids-rendering displays.andM;The result is stunning: Significant CPU power coupled with highly specializeddisplay processors allows the Model 835 to deliver real-time, 3-D shadedimages.andM;Although the Precision Architecture shares many of the features of other RISCarchitectures, such as Sun Microsystems' Sparc or Mips Computer Systems'R2000 and R3000 chip sets, Hewlett-Packard insists it did not begin itsdesign effort with the assumption that the Precision Architecture wouldfollow the RISC model.andM;However, after extensive analysis of user programs and simulations, HP'sengineers selected an architecture that combined many RISC features withattributes found in more traditional, complex-instruction set designs.andP;  Thatdesign was deemed to be the best for carrying HP's computers into the 1990s.andM;Hewlett-Packard's decision to include many RISC features in the PrecisionArchitecture design casts a shadow on those pundits who scoffed at thepossibility of RISC chips supporting large multiuser systems; the Series 800minicomputers are designed to support hundreds of users simultaneously.andM;Our own tests of Mips Computer Systems' Mips M/120-5 system revealed that aRISC-based machine is capable of excellent multiuser performance on arelational database management application such as Ingres.andP;  (See &quot;More Mipsfor the Money,&quot;  Digital Review, March 6, page 35.)andM;Because the Precision Architecture was designed for use in both commercialand technical systems, it has features not found in many other,workstation-specific CPU designs.andP;  These include instructions forbinary-coded decimal (BCD) arithmetic and unaligned string operations, whichare frequently found in Cobol applications.andM;But much of the Precision Architecture is decidedly RISC-like.andP;  Although ithas a larger instruction set than most other RISC-based designs--about 140instructions, compared with 94 for Sun's Sparc and 99 for the Mips R2000 chipset--it has substantially fewer instructions than the 320 in the VAXinstruction set.andM;Like most other RISC designs, the Precision Artchitecture does not implementfloating-point operations directly but supports the use of co-processors forhandling such special functions.andP;  Also, it has a relatively small number orregisters--32--but uses large caches for both instruction and data.andM;What this means, when all the dust has settled, is that the Model 835'sPrecision Architecture CPU provides exemplary processing power.andM;We tested the Model 835 and found that it delivered 11.68 MicroVAX II unitsof processing (MVUPs) on DR Labs' standard CPU 2 benchmark suite (Fig.andP;  1).andO;Although this performance does not match the CPU performance put out by suchdazzlers as the DECstation 3100, Mips M/120 or Apollo DN10010, it iscertainly respectable performance for a workstation-class machine.andM;However, keep in mind that our Fortran benchmark suite cannot measure theperformance of any of the graphics subsystems that can accompany the Model835--the CHX, SRX or TurboSRX--and on which much of its power relies.andM;MORE CPU POWERandM;Because these subsystems handle a considerable amount of the CPU processingrequired to generate complex graphics images, the CPU power left for othertasks is greater than in workstations that do not off-load any of theirgraphics processing, such as the DECstation 3100.andM;Hewlett-Packard prices the Model 835 CHZ with 8MB of memory at $59,500; theSRX and TurboSRX models are priced at $69,500 and $63,500, respectively.andO;(The lower price of the TurboSRX is surprising because its overallperformance is higher than the SRX; however, HP officials said there arecertain situations in which the SRX is a more appropriate platform than theTurboSRX.)andP;  These prices include a 16-user license for HP-UX, HP's Unixoperating system, but do not include any disk drives.andM;Because the Model 835 cannot be booted over a network yet, none of the threeconfigurations just described is complete; some sort of disk drive is needed.andO;Given the amount of disk space required by HP-UX, the smallest drive suitablefor the Model 835 is HP's 152MB drive, priced at $4,775.andP;  Other suitable HPdrives include a 40MB split drive (20MB fixed and 20MB removable media),priced at $13,420 a 304MB drive, $7,725; a 404MB drive, $10,200; and a 571MBdrive, $15,700.andM;Like its multiuser cousins, the Model 835 implementes HP's PrecisionArchitecture on two separate circuit boards (Fig.andP;  2).andP;  The processor boardis the heart of the CPU, and the processor-dependent hardware (PDH) boardcontains non-CPU-specific support hardware and the interface to I/O buses.andM;All components on the processor board are connected via the 32-bit cache bus,rated by Hewlett-Packard at a peak transfer rate of 120MB per second.andP;  Thesecomponents include the CPU itself, the instruction and data caches, thetranslation look-ahead buffer (TLB), the floating-point co-processor and thesystem interface unit (Fig.andP;  3).andM;The Precision Architecture CPU has a simple design.andP;  All operations (exceptfor loads and stores, of course) are performed between the CPU's 32general-purpose registers.andP;  In addition to the general registers, there are32 control registers and eight space registers, the latter used for virtualmemory management tasks.andM;All intructions are in a 32-bit fixed-length format to facilitate instructionfetching and decoding.andP;  The use of fixed-length formats also makes theconstruction of an execution pipeline a bit more straightforward.andM;The CPU can make memory references at the individual byte address, ascompared with some CPU architectures that require long-word addressing.andM;Other features of the architecture include delayed loads (allowing otherinstructions to be executed while a value is being loaded to a register) andcombined operations (such as arithmetic operations that may also include abranch).andM;The instruction and data cache are 64KB each, which seems to be a popularcache size for RISC-based machines.andP;  These caches are referenced with virtualrather than physical addresses, which eliminates the need for avirtual-to-physical address translation when the cache is used.andM;The floating-point unit is the only type of co-processor currentlyimplemented for the Model 835, although others--for graphics, encryption andthe like--may be forthcoming.andP;  The Precision Architecture allows as many aseight co-processors.andP;  Within the floating-point unit, the floating-pointcontroller handles two discrete units--one for add/subtract operations andthe other for multiply/divide operations--which can operate in parallel witheach other and with the Model 835's CPU.andM;Hewlett-Packard's engineers specifically designed the Precision Architectureto be able to use off-the-shelf components rather than requiring speciallydesigned hardware.andP;  These floating-point units are currently supplied byBipolar Integrated Technologies.andM;The floating-point co-processor has 12 64-bit registers for passing datavalues, a status register, seven operation and exception registers, and aconfiguration register.andM;To achieve maximum performance, it allows floating-point operations to bequeued (i.e., a new operation can be sent to the co-processor before theprevious operation has finished) and register bypassing (in which the resultof a previous floating-point operation can be directed back into one of thefloating-point units immediately as an operand for a successive operation).andM;In addition to as many as eight co-processors, the Precision Architecture cansupport eight special-function units.andM;Basically, the difference between a special-function unit and a co-processoris that a special-function unit does not have its own registers.andP;  Instead, ituses operands from the CPU's general registers and places its results into ageneral register.andP;  A co-processor has its own registers, which are loaded bythe main CPU, and returns its results there, where they can then be unloadedby the main processor.andM;The TLB maintains 4,096 entries--divided equally between instruction and dataaddresses--to assist with the translation of virtual memory addresses tophysical memory addresses.andM;The Precision Architecture employs 64-bit addressing, which allows a massiveaddress space.andP;  Of course, because all other components of the CPU work with32-bit values, some scheme is needed to make use of such large memoryaddresses.andP;  One scheme is the use of space register, which partition thevirtual address space and allow memory references to use 32-bit values as anoffset into one of those partitions.andM;REGIONAL ACCESSandM;Finally, the Precision Architecture uses a relatively advanced model forhardware-based security to provide four privilege levels (analogous tomultiple modes on the VAX architecture).andP;  These levels govern a process'saccess to specified regions of memory, for shared-memory applications withsecurity requirements.andM;The system interface unit connects the processor board components to theprocessor-dependent hardware board and to the Central Bus, which is theprimary bus of the 800 series.andM;The processor-dependent hardware board contains the configuration ROM, asystem clock, a control panel interface and one or two Channel I/O (CIO)buses for I/O devices.andP;  This module is connected directly to the CPU boardand to the Central Bus.andM;The nine-slot Central Bus, to which all of the Model 835's components attach,is 32 bits wide and has a transfer rate of 21MB per second.andM;Two slots are taken up by the processor and PDH boards and one by the displaycontroller interface, leaving six slots for memory.andP;  The Model 835 uses 8MBor 16MB memory boards, so a single machine can support as much as 96MB ofmemory.andM;Each CIO bus (the standard Model 835 has just one) supports seven slots forvarious I/O interfaces.andP;  One slot is occupied by the display controllerinterface, which connects the system processing uniit to a CHX, SRX orTurboSRX display controller.andM;One more CIO slot each is taken by a standard Ethernet interface card (eitherthick-wire or thin-wire) and an HP-IB interface card.andP;  The remaining four CIOslots are available for future expansion.andM;HP-IB is HEwlett-Packard's traditional input/output channel, based on theIEEE 488 standard, and provides a transfer rate of about 1.2MB per second.andO;This interface supports a wide range of devices, including Winchester andfloppy dis drives; nine-track and quarter-inch cartridge tape drivesalphanumeric and graphics terminls; impacT, inkjet and laser printer;plotters and other graphics devices, as well as a broad line ofinstrumentation.andM;The Model 835 uses all of Hewlett-Packard's usual human interface linkdevices such as a keyboard, mouse, graphics tablet, special keypads and audiooutput.andM;Graphics configurations available with the Model 835 include the CHX, SRX andTurboSRX.andM;The CHX option is an integer-based graphics accelerator that incorporates aMotorola 68020 CPU and a Weitek 8187 integer math unit to a yield improvedgraphics performance.andM;Displaying graphical elements on a screen involves quite a few steps and mayrequire many functions.andP;  The CHX option moves such high-level operations astransform and clipping calculations and device coordinate scaling intohardware so the Model 835' CPU is not burdened by these compute-intensivetasks.andM;The CHX configuration includes the graphics accelerator, an eight-bit framebuffer with two overlay planes, a 19-inch color monitor, a mouse, an ID(identification) module and audio.andM;The SRX and TurboSRX support advanced graphics primitives--such asnon-uniform rational B-spline curves, meshes and strips--in microcode,resulting in exceptional performance because none of those compute-intensiveprimitives needs to be handled by the Model 835's CPU (Fig.andP;  4).andM;Both options incorporate a four-stage graphics hardware pipeline (Fig.andP;  5)designed for the rendering of fully shaded objects with hidden surfacesremoved.andP;  That is, 3-D polygon generation--with shading, hidden-surfaceremoval and light sources--takes place in hardware.andM;THE BIG PICTUREandM;The SRX and TurboSRX configurations were described in detail in our review ofHewlett-Packard's HP 9000 Series 300 workstations.andP;  (See &quot;HP's Big Picture:The TurboSRX,&quot; Digital Review, March 20, page 40.)andM;Both the SRX and the TurboSRX provide 12 planes of color in a1,280-by-1,024-pixel display.andP;  Additional frame buffer memory can be added toincrease the number of graphics planes to 32, with four overlay planes.andM;The TurboSRX configuration is very similar to--and compatible with--the SRX,but offers three to 10 times the performance through enhanced technology.andM;The Hewlett-Packard HP 9000 Model 835 Superworkstation runs HP-UX,Hewlett-Packard's version of Unix.andP;  HP-UX, which is a port of ATandamp;T System Vrelease 3.0, includes many features from 4.3BSD, including the fast filesystem, sockets and NFS.andM;HP-UX conforms to the System V Interface Definition (SVID) and the X/OpenPortability Guide Issue 2, and it has passed the X/Open Verification Suite.andM;A Model 835 can be purchased with a 16-, 32- or 64-user HP-UX license.andM;HP-UX takes advantage of the real-time services of the Precision Architecutreto allow real-time priorities to be assigned to processes, to providetime-related system calls with resolutions to the microsecond, to allowprocesses to be scheduled with an accuracy of tens of milliseconds, toprovide control of buffering for faster I/O, and to offer signaling andprocess control features supporting real-time operation.andM;International language support is intrinsic to HP-UX; it provides transparentsupport of 22 languages, which can be selected independently of anapplication as long as the application was written to take advantage of thisfeature.andM;HP-UX includes those software tools that would be expected in any Unixoperating system: a C-language compiler, a symbolic debugger and anassembler.andP;  It also includes a device I/O library for programmer access toHP-IB and other HP devices such as control instruments.andM;Language compilers and interpreters available for the 800 series--from HP orfrom third-party vendors--included Fortran (with VAX extensions), Basic,Pascal, Ada, Lisp and APL.andM;The Model 835 uses the X Window System as its primary graphical userinterface.andP;  It is a fully implemented version of X11 release 2 and includesthe Xlib, Xt and X Widgets toolkits.andM;Like all of HP's workstations, the Model 835 uses HP's Starbase GraphicsLibrary for all graphics applications.andP;  Starbase, which provides the tools toproduce 2-D and 3-D graphics, is an extension to the ANSI Virtual DeviceComputer Graphics Interface.andM;While the Model 835 does not pack the same CPU punch as some of the otherhigh-end workstations we have tested, its graphics performance (particularlywhen coupled with the powerful turboSRX graphic option) is stunning.andP;  At$63,500 for a TurboSRX version, the Model 835 is very competitive with other&quot;superworkstation&quot; contenders such as the Apollo DN10010 and the Power Irisfrom Silicon Graphics.andM;Precision Architecture is a solid design; striking a balance between RISC andCISC features, it should achieve HP's goal of supporting its computing needsinto the next decade and beyond.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
