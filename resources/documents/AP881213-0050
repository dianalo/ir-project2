(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A landlord's policy of monthly fees forthings like sitting on the front porch or having a freezer hasangered residents of a low-income housing development.   The price of lounging on a porch or sitting on a stoop at theWinter Green Apartments is $25. Three violations are grounds foreviction. Landlord Eric B. Allen of Greater Hartford Realty says thepolicy was implemented earlier this year to reduce drug traffic, andis working.   Allen, whose company began managing the apartments in May, alsocharges residents a variety of monthly fees, including for havingfreezers ($9), clothes dryers ($9), and air conditioners ($12).   The porch-sitting policy is an apparent violation of federalhousing rules because it has not been approved by the Department ofHousing and Urban Development, which oversees the federallysubsidized apartments, an official said.   Residents in the 32-building, 160-unit complex are upset aboutthe policy. A meeting on the topic last month developed into ashouting match between tenants and property managers.   ``It's just ridiculous,'' said Albert J. Farmer, who has lived atWinter Green for 13 years.   The 73-year-old Farmer, whose left leg is amputated below theknee, is targeted for eviction because he has not paid the $9 feefor a freezer.   ``I respect him, but I have to treat him like anyone else,''Allen said.   Farmer plans to fight eviction.   ``He's acting like a dictator,'' Farmer said. ``He has peopleafraid of him. But I'm not going anywhere.''   Allen said the fines are helping to improve the property: keepingpeople off the porches has reduced drug trafficking.   ``The idea of imposing fines has changed things,'' he said. ``Wedon't have the problems we used to have.''   Allen said he won't consider relaxing the policy.   ``We haven't won. The dope dealers are standing by waiting for usto move out.''   Robert Donovan, housing management director for the HUD inHartford, said the porch-sitting policy apparently violates federalhousing rules.   ``To assess additional charges, they have to ask us forpermission,'' he said. ``They never asked us for authorization for afee for loitering on a porch.''   Donovan said Greater Hartford Realty has received approval fromHUD to levy other monthly charges in addition to rent. Most coverthe electricity used by heavy appliances.</TEXT></DOC>
