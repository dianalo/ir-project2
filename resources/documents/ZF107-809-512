 And nothing could be more plentiful andelaborate than the gigantic network of features hidden beneath.andM;That combination of simplicity and power makes WordPerfect the $495 colossusof word processors, a giant both in its range of functions as well as in itsshare of the market.andP;  WordPerfect Corp.'s powerhouse can be found on everyvariety of system from the Apple II and the Macintosh to the Amiga, Atari,VAX, IBM 370, and on to OS/2 and Unix machines.andM;WordPerfect serves the whole spectrum of usrs while serving the wholespectrum of computers.andP;  Beginners can create and print a file after learningto use two or three function keys.andP;  More-advanced users learn other functionkeys that lead to modest-looking one-line menusf only in the submenus onemore level down does WordPerfect's enormous range of options and functionsfinally become apparent.andP;  (Version 5.1, due to appear by the time you readthis, will have mouse support and optional pull-down menus that let youforget the function keys altogether.)andM;WordPerfect serves corporate and academic users by being the mostcommunicative of word processors.andP;  It lets you share files with minimumeffort and maximum compatibility.andP;  If you create a document with fonts andlayouts tailored to your PostScript typesetter, you can hand the file to acolleague with a 9-pin dot matrix printer, and his copy of the program willautomatically produce the best possible approximation of the original.andP;  Youneed give your colleague only one file because WordPerfect documents areself-sufficient enough to carry their stylesheets and graphics with them.andM;WordPerfect is highly hospitable to files created by other software.andP;  Builtinto the program is a smart ASCII import that optionally strips excesscarriage returns.andP;  A conversion program imports and exports documents in DCA,WordStar, MultiMate, and other formats, and imports but does not export word4.0 files.andP;  Version 5.1 will add links to spreadsheets and automaticallyupdate the links whenever you load the WordPerfect file; 5.1 will also readvirtually any database file.andM;INTEGRATED FUNCTIONSandM;All of WordPerfect's functions are integrated, so that if, for example, youchoose another printer driver, all related options change automatically--theprinter port, the default type style and size, the sizes of superscripts andheadings, even the paper size.andP;  WordPerfect does the tedious work ofreformatting and leaves you to get on with the work of thinking and writing.andM;No other word processor approaches WordPerfect's virtuosic control voer morethan 450 printers.andP;  You can make fine adjustments in the average spacingbetween letters and words.andP;  You can designate one page in a file as printedletterhead, another as standard letter paper, another as an envelope--andeach prints in the correct orientation, using paper taken from the correctslot on the printer.andP;  WordPerfect's printer drivers are full-fledged programswith variables and branching, rather than mere lists of data, yet a suppliedprinter-definition program lets you modify or create drivers using simplemenus.andP;  (The manual for the printer-definition program costs an extra$19.95.)andM;In its handling of foreign and technical characters, WordPerfect is rivaledonly by Nota Bene.andP;  You can enter 1,700 characters, including Greek, Hebrew,Cyrillic, and Japanese, from the keyboard using a &quot;compose&quot; key that insertsan &quot;e&quot; when you type an &quot;e&quot; and an apostrophe or inserts less-commoncharacters when you enter numerical codes for the 15 character sets listed inthe manual.andP;  If you don't like typing 4,23 to enter the copyright symbol, youcan automate it with a macro.andM;A text screen attached to an EGA, VGA, or Hercules card can display 512different characters, and all 1,700 can appear on the graphic page preview,which zooms in to 200 percent magnification.andP;  You won't get nasty surpriseswhen you try to print special characters, because the graphic previewdisplays a character only if your printer's fonts can print it.andP;  In Version5.1, if your fonts don't include the character you need, WordPerfect willprint it by generating it as a graphic--a spectacular convenience forforeign-language work, matched by 5.1's new feature that can display andprint any equation as a graphic.andM;WordPerfect handles pictures with the same aplomb it brings to type.andP;  You canrotate, size, stretch, or crop an image, and position it at any point on apage or insert it into a line of text like a character.andP;  WordPerfect usesmeasurements as small as 0.00083 of an inch, so you can specify the width andlocation of graphics lines and boxes to the limit of a printer's ability.andM;WordPerfect lets you put a box around text using any style or shading youlike.andP;  In Version 5.0 this function is powerful but clumsy because you can'tsee boxed text on the normal editing screen; in 5.1, boxes, tables, andside-by-side columns will be produced effortlessly by moving the cursoraround an ingenious table editor.andM;TEXT FORMATTINGandM;You can apply virtually any formatting to text in a WordPerfect document,although sometimes you have to use roundabout methods.andP;  You can't specifyparagraph formats as straighforwardly as in other programs.andP;  You have toinsert an unintuitive code if you want headers or footnotes to print in thefont you choose.andP;  For a hanging indent you press the Indent key to indent theparagraph, then press the Margin Release key to move the first line back tothe margin.andP;  (Margin Release key?andP;  On a word processor?)andP;  These indent codesmove the cursor to a tab stop, which means that your paragraph formats willchange in ways you may not like when you reset your tabs.andP;  At the start of ahanging-indented paragraph, the cursor jumps bewilderingly forward and backon screne as it moves through the format codes.andP;  To edit such paragraphssafely, yu have to split the screen between the normal editing window and awindow that lets you thinker directly with the codes.andM;WordPerfect's styles let you incorporate text and format codes into a kind ofsupercode whose content changes when you change stylesheets.andP;  The effects aremore elaborate than Word's styles, but less convenient to apply because youchoose styles from a menu and have to write macros if you want to apply themwith only one or two keys.andP;  If you don't use styles, you have to write macrosto make global format changes in a file.andP;  WordPerfect has no direct way oftransforming all underlined text to italic, and more-complex changes requireelaborate macro programming.andM;WordPerfect's footnotes offer a combination of great power and minorinconvenience.andP;  You can have footnotes and endnotes in the same file, and youcan reference them with letters, numbers, or symbols.andP;  But you can't edit afootnote on the same screen with the main text, and to make a search orreplace operation extend into footnotes, you have to remember to press Homebefore the Search key.andP;  footnote numbering can be restarted at any number andisn't disrupted by formatting changes as it can be in Word.andP;  Automaticcross-referencing links notes, tables, pages, and graphics.andP;  One reasonWordPerfect is popular in law offices is its built-in suport for the specialabbreviations and formats used in legal citations.andP;  WordPerfect does createoutlines but can not collapse them so that only the higher levels arevisible.andM;WordPerfect's speller lacks a wholeword option but lets you remove or addwords from the main dictionary so that they appear among the alternatives formisspelled words.andP;  You can insert codes in a document that make WordPerfectswitch to another dictionary when it reaches that code--an ideal feature forfiles that use more than one language.andM;KEYBOARD INTERFACEandM;WordPerfect's keyboard interfance generally puts related functions ondifferent states of the same key, but some assignments seem capricious: thespeller, for example, is on Ctrl-F2, the thesaurus is on Alt-F1.andP;  Block movesand copies require excess keystrokes.andP;  To reach the beginning of the text ina file you press &quot;Home Home Up&quot;; but you press Home three times, then Up, toreach the beginning of the codes in the file.andP;  Although you normally completea command by typing a strin and pressing Enter, with the Search key you typethe search string and then press the Search key again.andP;  This lets you searchfor carriage returns without entering the special codes required by otherprograms, but it's an inconsistency that can waste more time than it saves.andM;WordPerfect lets you create macros by recording keystrokes or using abuilt-in macro editor that includes variables, branching, and even lets youcreate menus that replace the ones designed by WordPerfect.andP;  A sample macrosupplied on the disks makes a calculator pop up on the editing screen.andO;Mail-merge in 5.0 doesn't directly support variables, but 5.1's revampedmail-merge will be fully programmable.andM;You get only two windows for editing files, but you can view a third filefrom the directory screen.andP;  That same directory screen supports extensivefile management as well as word and document searches, including searches indocument summries.andP;  If you use the $129 WordPerfect Library--with itsintelligent DOES shell, calculator, calendar, small database, macro editor,and other utilities--you can capture text fromt he screen and transfer it toany application.andP;  WordPerfect Office, a $495 package for use on networks($150 for each extra station), expands on Library to include e-mail andscheduling.andM;A &quot;master document&quot; feature in Version 5.0 lets you incorporate other filesas &quot;subdocuments&quot; that can be edited and modified separately and then printedas a single large file with continuous pagination, cross-referncing, andfootnotes.andP;  WordPerfect can compare a file on-screen with a file on-disk andautomatically redline or strike through any changes or re-arrangements.andO;Nonprinting comments added to files can be converted to printable text but,unlike Word's invisible text, they can't be reconverted automatically intocomments.andM;A refreshingly intelligent installation program checks out your system tomake sure WordPerfect will work correctly from the start.andP;  Once insideWordPerfect itself, the help system is extensive enough to let you ignore themanual until you need to work with complex functions like merging, sorting,and math.andP;  In Version 5.0, the help system makes you consult an onscreenindex if you don't know which key has the function you need help with; thehelp in 5.1 will be context sensitive.andM;Version 5.0's looseleaf manual is arranged alphabetically rather thanlogically and doesn't document al featuresf 5.1 will be better documented.andP;  Adisk-based tutorial gets your feet wet in the program's basic techniques, anda400-page workbook takes you into the program's depths.andP;  If all else fails,you can get fast and usually knowledgeable advice by calling a toofreenumber.andP;  WordPerfect's customer support is by far the best in the industry.andM;Minor updates of WordPerfect appear every six weeks to two months and cost$10 or more, depending on the number of disks involved.andP;  You can even order asubscription and use one copy to update and entire office.andP;  These updatesinclude minor bug-fixes as well as improved features and new options on themenus.andP;  wordPerfect 5.0's first release, for example, didn't supportlandscape graphics on the LaserJet and didn't include kerning tables; laterupdates have both.andM;A $549 OS/2 version of WordPerfect 5.0 has the same features as the DOSversion excect that it displays a session number on the status line if youopen multiple copies of the program.andP;  A Presentation Manager version is duein 1990, with a Windows version a distinct possiblity soon after.andM;WordPerfect is the industry standard and also the flagship of a companydedicated to maintaining its dominance.andP;  WordPerfect's control over theprinted page makes all other word processors look crude by comparison, and itcombines unequaled power with an interface that makes basic functions simple.andO;The program's main weakness lies in the fact that some of its most powerfulfunctions, including those that format a page, are more awkward to use thanthey need to be.andP;  But WordPerfect is the word processor that individual andcorporate users can buy with the utmost confidence that it will meet theirneeds both now and in the future.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
