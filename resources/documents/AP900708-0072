But the strikers vowed to keep them shut in the week-old wave ofwalkouts to protest government policy.   ``It is the obligation of all workers to go back to worktomorrow,'' the president told The Associated Press in an interviewSunday.   A police communique, released Saturday evening, said, ``Policewill guarantee workers free access to their respective job sites''beginning Monday.   The communique also warned citizens not to disturb the peace,conduct street demonstrations without permission or block traffic.   The police warning will not convince an estimated 90,000strikers to back off from their demands, Sandinista National LaborFront head Lucio Jimenez told reporters.   ``Faced with a position of force, we have to respond the sameway,'' Jimenez said Saturday.   The government has tried to head off the strike with economicconcessions, but workers have held out with political demands.   On Friday, Finance Minister Emilio Pereira announced a 43percent wage increase for civil servants in lower pay brackets,plus cost-of-living increases for 65,000 of the government's100,000 workers.   But National Labor Front leader Jose Angel Bermudez said theoffer was an effort to fool state employees.   ``It's an attempt to get the workers back on the job and buy offtheir just demands by means of a solemn joke about salaries,''Bermudez said. He said inflation will eat up the earnings andmassive firings are in the offing.   Government agricultural, industrial, service and office workersare demanding a new minimum wage, job security, protection ofpeasant land distributed under land reforms of the former leftistSandinista administration, financing for industrial ventures andthe opening of new construction projects.   Private sector employees have joined the government workers indemands for more participation in economic policy-making.   The workers are allied with the Sandinista Front, which remainsthe largest single political bloc in Nicaragua.   The series of strikes is the second in the 2-month-oldadministration of Mrs. Chamorro.   Mrs. Chamorro was the candidate of the U.S.-backed UnitedNational Opposition coalition in the Feb. 25 elections, in whichshe beat Sandinista party incumbent Daniel Ortega. She is trying toreverse his party's centralized government policy and replace itwith free-market strategy.</TEXT></DOC>
