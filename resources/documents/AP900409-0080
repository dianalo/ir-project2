Under terms of the deal, which has been approved by the boardsof directors of both companies, MCI will acquire all outstandingshares of Telecom USA's common stock for $42 a share.   Telecom USA stock jumped $15.87{ higher to $37.75 a share inheavy midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. MCI was down87{ cents at $36 a share.   The transaction is subject to approval by Telecom's stockholders.   ``The prospect of merging two dynamic, high-growth companieswith similar cultures is very exciting,'' said Bert C. Roberts Jr.,MCI's president and chief operating officer. ``Combining theirstrengths will benefit shareholders, customers and employeesalike.''   The proposed acquisition continues a pattern by MCI, which hasincreased its market share in part by buying smaller long-distancephone companies. In the last few years it has bought SatelliteBusiness Systems, Western Union International and RCA GlobalCommunications.   MCI, which is headquartered in Washington, is the nation'ssecond-largest long distance phone company after American Telephoneandamp; Telegraph Co. Telecom, based in Atlanta, is the fourth-largest.Telecom primarily serves customers in the Southeast and Midwest.   MCI's 1989 revenues totaled $6.5 billion, while Telecom had $713million in sales last year.   ATandamp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the announcement showed how``hotly competitive'' the industry is. ATandamp;T, the dominant longdistance carrier, is asking the Federal Communications Commissionto loosen some regulatory ties on ATandamp;T that other companies do notface.   ``This development today is further evidence of the need forthat,'' said Linnen. ``It suggests two vigorous companies arecombining forces to provide even more competition. ... We wake upevery day to a real knockdown, drag-out fight in the marketplace.''   ATandamp;T holds about 64 percent of the long distance market, downfrom about 90 percent before the court-ordered breakup of the oldBell system in 1984, and had $19.5 billion in revenues last year,said Linnen. FCC figures showed MCI with about 12 percent of themarket and Sprint with 9 percent.   Roberts said both companies have played a major role in``advancing technology, developing innovative services, and meetingcustomer requirements.''   He added: ``We look forward to having Telecom USA management andemployees assume roles in the new structure, and welcome theopportunity to serve its customers.''   O. Gene Gabbard, Telecom's chairman and chief executive officer,said MCI recognizes his company's ``creative approach'' to productdevelopment and marketing.   ``Both companies stand to gain by teaming employees, facilitiesand services, and as a unified force, working to further enhancethe ability to provide the highest value services in this rapidlygrowing and demanding industry,'' Gabbard said.   The merger is subject to government approval under theHart-Scott-Rodino Act. It is expected to be concluded as quickly aspossible, the companies said in a joint news release.   The complete terms of the merger will be included in a proxystatement to be mailed to Telecom shareholders.</TEXT></DOC>
