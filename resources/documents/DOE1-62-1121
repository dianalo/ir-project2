<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-62-1121 </DOCNO><TEXT>Semiconductor laser diode with narrow linewidths (10 kHz - 10 MHz) areessential for coherent fiber optical communication systems. Linewidthmeasurement techniques fall into three groups. The authors discuss eachgroup and then focus their attention on the unbalanced interferometricmethod. The authors developed, theoretically, the correlated unbalancedinterferometric method and show that the envelope function of the beatsignal is the Fourier transform of the original laser lineshape. Theyalso proposed novel approaches to the linewidth measurement techniques,such as series use of Bragg cell and combination of Mach-Zehnder andSagnac interferometer.</TEXT></DOC>
