It summarizesa sensitivity analysis which was done to arrive at a recommendation onthe type of hardware to be used. It shows that the choice of technologyis dependent on many factors, the most important being the salinity ofthe feedwater. When the feedwater is under 1500 mg/1 Total DissolvedSolids (TDS), then ED is probably the better choice based on economicconsiderations. When the salinity exceeds 3000 TDS, then RO becomes thebetter choice. ED is the more flexible of the two technologies. Withproper controls, a given Ed system can accommodate variable power inputand variable salinity. RO equipment operates better when the feedwater,power, and other factors are constant.</TEXT></DOC>
