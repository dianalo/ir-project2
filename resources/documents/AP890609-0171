Defense ministers said they will seek increases of 3 percentdiscounting inflation. The goal dates to 1977 although many of theWestern alliance's 16 members, including the United States, havenever achieved or sustained it.   ``Notwithstanding the announced unilateral reductions in WarsawPact forces and the possibility of future arms control agreements, avery considerable imbalance remains between the forces of the WarsawPact and NATO,'' Western defense ministers said in statement after atwo-day meeting.   ``The target of a real increase in defense expenditure of theorder of 3 percent should, in the absence of tangible improvement inthe balance of forces, serve as a general guide.''   In Vienna, NATO ambassadors proposed an unprecedented exchange ofinformation among East, West and neutral nations about militaryforces in Europe. The proposal, made at talks between 35 nations onbuilding confidence on European security, calls for a data bank thatwould make available details on armed forces and weapons deployment,arms procurement and other matters.   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters in Brussels,``If we reach an agreement for reductions in armaments on both sidesto equal levels, there will still be the need for modernizing theseforces.''   He said the prospect of reducing conventional forces in Europe,being negotiated in Vienna, is no reason to relax defense spending.   NATO in December listed alliance nations whose defense effortswere considered insufficient, fueling criticism by U.S. lawmakerswho believe the United States pays too great a share for Europe'ssecurity.   Cheney said the United States will not reach the 3 percent targetin higher defense spending in the next fiscal year, but stressedthis would not undermine U.S. commitments in Europe.   At the meeting, Cheney discussed President Bush's proposal toremove 30,000 U.S. troops and 325,000 Soviet soldiers from Europe,and reduce aircraft fleets by 15 percent _ NATO's by 750 planes andthe Warsaw Pact's by 3,000.   He said the aircraft reductions would not include British andFrench planes able to carry conventional and nuclear arms.   Cheney said he assured Western allies that Washington will notwithdraw from Europe 72 F-16 jetfighters in Spain. The planes, whichCheney called ``absolutely vital to the defense'' of NATO's southernflank, are to go to Italy when Spain ends an accord with the UnitedStates.   The proposed aircraft cuts would leave NATO and the seven-nationEast bloc each with roughly 4,600 combat aircraft in Europe, NATOsources said.   Bush proposed last week that the East and West agree in six to 12months to the cuts and others proposed in Vienna for tanks, armoredpersonnel carriers and artillery pieces. NATO-Warsaw Pact talksbegan in Vienna this year.   Cheney called the timetable optimistic.   ``But I think it is well worth our making that effort,'' he said.``There is a real sense of momentum now.''   The defense ministers said raising defense budgets by 3 percent ayear must remain a goal.   ``There was broad agreement that sound defenses are constantlykept up to date,'' said NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner ofWest Germany.   He said the Warsaw Pact retains roughly a 2-to-1 superiority overNATO in conventional forces.   Woerner said recently announced Soviet troop withdrawals fromEastern Europe ``have still to be fully implemented'' and Sovietmilitary production remains ``very high.''   In December, Gorbachev said 50,000 Red Army troops would bewithdrawn from East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary by the endof 1990. He also has announced that 500 short-range nuclear missileswill be removed from Europe.   The Vienna proposal was presented by the Netherlands on behalf ofNATO at a closed session of the conference attended by the UnitedStates and Canada, the Soviet Union and all European nations exceptAlbania.   They are discussing confidence and security-building measures toverify and enhance agreements reached at the parallel Vienna talksbetween the NATO and seven Warsaw Pact nations on reducingconventional forces in Europe.   The Western alliance proposes each country:   _Provide information by Dec. 15 each year on weapons procurementprograms for the following year and exact deployment of troops downto regiment or brigade level and their peacetime strength andequipment.   _Submit at seven days' notice to at least three inspections ayear.   _Give more exact information about maneuvers and advance noticeof all maneuvers involving 50,000 troops or more.   _Improve working facilities for inspectors, observation ofmaneuvers and for foreign military attaches and journalists.</TEXT></DOC>
