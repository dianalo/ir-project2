Proceeds of the settlement with the Philadelphia-based firm ofBlank, Rome, Comisky andamp; McCauley will be shared by the FSLIC withformer stockholders of Sunrise Savings and Loan Association ofBoynton Beach, Fla.   The settlement, which the FSLIC said was the largest ever paidto it by a law firm to settle a claim, included establishment of a$10 million indemnity fund to cover any claims by outside partiesagainst the firm, which represented Sunrise.   The federal suit filed in 1986 charged the law firm actednegligently in advising Sunrise, improperly closed loans, aidedformer Sunrise officials in violating several statutes and bankingregulations and represented parties with conflicts of interest.   ``This settlement demonstrates that where violationscontributing to insolvency are caused by the negligence ormalpractice of professionals, including law firms, the (FederalHome Loan) Bank Board will hold them, as well as thrift management,fully responsible and accountable,'' said M. Danny Wall, chairmanof the bank board.   The FSLIC sued the thrift's former officers, directors andlawyers, including 87 partners and former partners at Blank Rome.   Under the agreement, the FSLIC will receive 72 percent of thefirst $40 million and 95 percent of the remaining $10 million.Unused funds will revert to the FSLIC and shareholders by August1992.   Sunrise was closed in 1986 and insured accounts were transferredto the newly created Beach Federal Savings and Loan Association.   Blank Rome senior partner Michael Foxman founded Sunrise in1980. His law firm colleague, M. Kalman Gitomer, once served aschairman of the thrift.   David Berger, a Philadelphia attorney representing theshareholders, said it was an ``excellent settlement.''   David Girard-di Carlo, managing partner of Blank Rome, saidTuesday the settlement was in the best interest of the firm, butsaid the firm continued to deny the allegations.</TEXT></DOC>
