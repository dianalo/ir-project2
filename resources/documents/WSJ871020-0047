The timing of the announcement with the stock market's crash was coincidental. For some time, Chase had planned to announce the new funds in conjunction with the annual convention of the American Bankers Association in Dallas.    Questioned about the timing, a Chase spokesman conceded that investors right now might not be interested in mutual funds investing in stocks, but he said that they may want to put money in the three money market funds.    Chase will be the investment adviser and shareholder servicing agent for the funds, called the Vista funds. Massachusetts Financial Services, which isn't affiliated with Chase, will be the sponsor, administrator and distributor. </TEXT></DOC>
