Named Hipparcos after an ancient Greek astronomer, the satellitefailed to reach its planned geostationary orbit and has had toundergo a complex revision of its mission involving ground stationsin French Guyana, West Germany and Australia.   The further use of a U.S. ground station is being contemplated,bringing the satellite's coverage to about 93 percent of the areaoriginally planned.   The life of the satellite in its revised orbit is likely to belimited by the reduction of electricity generated by its solarcells, the agency said.   The agency said it would give an evaluation of Hipparcos'performance next year.</TEXT></DOC>
