Consequently, the U.S. Congress sought ways to expedite domesticenergy production. Many energy experts within government and industryviewed the nation's offshore oil and gas deposits as one of the mostpromising domestic energy resources. As recently as 1982, for instance,the U.S. Department of the Interior estimated that the outer continentalshelf (OCS) held the promise of more than 40 billion barrels of oil and230 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in undiscovered reserves. It wasnot surprising then, that the national energy debate of a decade agoculminated in, among other things, deregulation of oil prices and far-reachingamendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), the principallaw governing offshore oil and gas leasing in federal waters. However,it was not the intent of Congress to have the Department of the Interiorsinglemindedly pursue national energy objectives. The OCSLA amendmentsrequired the Secretary of Interior to consider a wide variety of factorsin the development of the prescribed 5-year leasing schedule, includingthe amount of resource expected, development benefits, environmentalrisks, other uses of the sea bed, the interest of oil and gas producers,and &quot;the laws, goals and policies of affected states.&quot; Furthermore, abalance was to be struck between meeting domestic energy needs, environmentalprotection, and the potential for adverse impact to the nation's coastalzone.</TEXT></DOC>
