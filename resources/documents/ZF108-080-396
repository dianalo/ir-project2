 I explained that the differencebetween an expert system and our previous water jugtype problem solvers isprimarily that the expert system is smarter about the options it evaluates.andO;Rather than generating and testing thousands of possibilities, an expertsystem is intended to choose only a few of the possibilities--all reasonableones, we hope.andM;Then I discussed the pieces of an expert system, as shown in Figure 1.andP;  Anexpert system has two databases: one of general rules the expert system usesto reason from and one of facts specific to the particular case at hand.andP;  Forexample, as an expert on appropriate apparel you know that the right clothingfor venturing out into a rainstorm is a raincoat: that's a rule about theworld in general.andP;  So when I seek advice from you about what to wear on aparticular day, you look outside and see that it is raining.andP;  Using thiscase-specific fact (it's raining) and a general rule (when it's raining youshould wear a raincoat), you deliver expert advice: wear a raincoat today.andM;CONSTRUCTIONandM;Modeling an expert problem requires an expert in the field, and a knowledgeengineer to classify the expert's knowledge.andP;  The idea is that experts canexpertly evaluate a given situation, but may not know exactly how they do it.andO;So this new kind of computer professional, the knowledge engineer, interactswith the experts to develop the rules.andP;  A knowledge engineer is part systemsanalyst, part interviewer, part problem solver.andP;  When interviewing an expertin, say, yacht appraisal, the knowledge engineer would display hundreds ofphotographs of yachts to the expert and ask how much each was worth:andM;KE: What do you appraise this at?andM;E: $70,000.andM;KE: Why?andM;E: It's a 35 foot yawl with teak above deck.andM;KE: (Looks for another 35 foot yawl with teak above deck.)andP;  How about thisone?andM;E: $80,000.andM;KE: It's just like the other one, isn't it?andM;E: (Chuckling.)andP;  No, that's a Horton Special.andP;  They only made 70 of them.andO;Quite in demand.andP;  That's not just any yawl.andM;And so on.andP;  As all this is happening, the knowledge engineer is building astructure, perhaps a decision tree or similar tool.andP;  According to oneexpert-system vendor, this yacht appraisal story is true: yacht appraisersare rare and well-paid.andP;  This vendor claims that they sat down with one ofthe foremost of these appraisers and developed an expert system, which endedup with dozens of rules and looked quite impressive.andP;  But then the vendor ranthe resulting rules database through a program that generalized these ruleswhen possible and removed redundant rules.andP;  The result was that the wholething boiled down to exactly six rules.andM;So what are the uses for an expert system?andP;  Hayes-Roth et al.andP;  suggest thefollowing:andM;* InterpretationandM;* PredictionandM;* DiagnosisandM;* DesignandM;* PlanningandM;* MonitoringandM;* DebuggingandM;* RepairandM;* InstructionandM;* Control.andM;What have expert systems been used for?andP;  The big success stories in the fieldhave been:andM;System  Type of ExpertandM;DENDRAL  Interpretation MYCIN  Diagnosis XCON/R1  Planner PROUST  PascalDebugger HEARSAY  Interpretation MACSYMA  Instruction Prospector  PredictionPUFF  DiagnosisandM;THE FIRST EXPERT SYSTEMandM;The whole expert system industry is said to have started with DENDRAL.andO;Chemical instruments called &quot;mass spectrometers&quot; can determine the chemicalcomposition of a substance: they burn up a specimen of the substance, thenanalyze the resulting smoke to find the number of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen,and other atoms in a substance.andP;  A mass spectrometer could, for example, lookat a mystery substance and see that it contains two carbon, two hydrogen, andtwo oxygen atoms.andP;  But that's only half the story.andM;You may recall from high school chemistry that atoms have a certain number ofbonds: carbon has four, oxygen two, hydrogen one:andM;Like tiny Tinkertoys, the atoms fit together to form molecules in which allthe bonds are satisfied.andP;  But it takes time to develop all of thecombinations, as in the example molecule:andM;H-H O=O O=C=O or H-C[triple bond]C-H or H-O-C[triple bond]C-O-HandM;are just three example possibilities, and this is a relatively simplemolecule.andP;  One organic molecule, benzene, has a nonintuitive circularstructure that took years to figure out: the scientist who first visualizedits six-carbon ring claimed to have first seen it in a dream in which a snakedevoured its own tail.andM;Dreaming answers to tough questions makes for a good story, but you don'twant to have to depend on it for research.andP;  The circular structure of benzenetook so long to determine because it didn't fit scientists' previousexpectations and their fixedness about organic structures.andP;  The computer hasno such expectations.andP;  That's where DENDRAL came in.andM;After receiving output from a mass spectrometer, an early version of DENDRALdetermined and reported all of the ways the molecules could fit together.andO;The computer that was running DENDRAL had no graphics (this was in the1960s), so reading the computer's output took some getting used to.andP;  But itwas better than doing it by hand.andP;  So far, however, nothing about DENDRAL wasintelligent at all; it was just an incredibly fast game of Tinkertoys.andM;That's when the designers added rules of thumb and made DENDRAL the world'sfirst expert system.andP;  Some combinations, like the one with the doublecarbon-carbon bond and the oxygen-oxygen bond, are unlikely and unstable, sothe rules for unlikely combinations were used to trim the tree ofpossibilities.andM;I have some problems with calling DENDRAL an expert system.andP;  It seems morelike a blind searcher, as in our earlier problems.andP;  Later systems are closerto what we recognize today as a true expert system structure.andP;  One of thebest known of these modern expert systems is MYCIN.andM;MYCIN is intended to help doctors diagnose internal infections.andP;  Just as I amneither an expert on spectrometers nor internal medicine, I apologize if Iget any of this wrong.andP;  The central problem of handling internal infectionsis identifying the attacking organism.andP;  Once in the hospital, a patient isexposed to a large amount of nasty bacteria from the other sick people.andP;  Someof these organisms have been hanging around this hospital for a while, sothey've gotten pretty tough.andP;  Once it has been determined that a patient hasan internal infection, the doctor has to work fast--such an infection cankill someone in as little as five days.andP;  Tests will pinpoint the organism;however, some can take more than five days to get results, so the doctor'spretty much forced to do some guessing.andM;Which is where MYCIN comes in.andP;  Given information from tests, symptoms, andso on, MYCIN offers advice to treat the most likely sources of infection.andP;  Itknows about side effects of drugs and how to interpret common tests.andP;  Aphysician I know, who has worked with MYCIN, says &quot;It's not brilliant, butit's as good as many doctors would be on a good day--and it never has baddays.&quot;andM;HOW AND WHY?andM;But I still haven't addressed what separates MYCIN and its compatriot expertsystems from other computer programs.andP;  Why is it different from a programthat looks up a simple set of tables?andP;  Two words: &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why.&quot;andM;I spent several years building large scale economic models in the late 1970sand the early 1980s.andP;  They were generally at least 20,000 lines of Fortran IVrunning on an IBM System/370 computer.andP;  Government agencies usually requestedand paid for them.andP;  These models examined large issues, such as how retireeswill affect the economy in the next 75 years or how government energypolicies will affect natural-gas prices.andP;  These programs were monsters tobuild, maintain, and understand.andM;Once the model was built, I ran alternative scenarios to analyze policychoices.andP;  For example, an energy or environment model would simulate theeffects of imposing a tax against older, dirtier coal electric generationplants.andP;  A nonintuitive result appears.andP;  Is this to be trusted, or is itmerely a bug in the model?andP;  A lot of time was wasted doing scenarioverification and with good reason--the model went off the tracks regularly.andO;It's not a comment on the model builders but rather on the complexity ofhuman systems.andM;Many of the same people who offered to &quot;model anything&quot; in the late 1970s arenow in the expert-system business, at least where I live (Washington, D.C.).andO;Are they merely late-80s bandits?andP;  Perhaps.andP;  Expert systems are really justup-to-date models, except for the &quot;why&quot; command (a major difference); itserves as a built-in debugger.andP;  When the scenario results are &quot;nonintuitive,&quot;they can be immediately checked.andM;At any time, an expert system will ask a question like &quot;does the rock you areexamining (and are trying to identify) have green flecks?&quot;andP;  Rather thananswering, you can ask, &quot;why?&quot;andP;  It then will say something like (I'm makingthis up) &quot;I'm trying to establish that it is azotholite, and azotholite hasgreen flecks.&quot;andP;  You know that it isn't azotholite, as that's only found onthe moon, so you can tell the expert system to try another tack.andP;  Similarly,when the program comes up with a solution, you can say, &quot;how?&quot;andP;  How did itreach this conclusion?andP;  It may say &quot;I know that it is azotholite because rule14 states that azotholite has green flecks, and rule 50 states thatazotholite is metamorphic.andP;  You have answered that it had green flecks, and Ideduced from other information that it is metamorphic.andP;  Would you like to seehow I know it is metamorphic?&quot;andM;At this point, you may say to yourself, &quot;I've never trusted rule 14--it's toogeneral,&quot; and throw out the result or even tell the system to disregard rule14, and continue diagnosing.andP;  Big Fortran models don't do that.andM;So the big virtue of a good expert system is that it's honest and can keepits users honest.andP;  Too many analysts try to predict the future with acomputer, and their results are presented to their audience in atake-it-or-leave-it, it's-what-the-computer-says fashion.andM;Mark Minasi is a managing partner at Moulton, Minasi, and Co. in Columbia,Md.andP;  He teaches AI seminars across the country and provides consultingservices in systems development and troubleshooting.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
