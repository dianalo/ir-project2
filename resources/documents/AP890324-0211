(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Major chocolate companies moving into theEaster specialty candy market are getting a sweet reward in the formof higher sales.   The National Confectioners Association is projecting a 2 percentincrease in sales of Easter chocolate and candy this year, up to$815 million.   ``Seasonal chocolates are really big business,'' said JoanSteuer, president of Chocolate Marketing of Los Angeles. ``There arepredictions that the market will top out _ how much more chocolatecan people take? _ but I believe that there's a world ofopportunity.''   While seasonal confections were once supplied mostly by specialtymakers of chocolate bunnies and marshmallow eggs, candy giants suchas Hershey Foods Corp. and Mandamp;M-Mars are trying to get a bigger biteof the profitable Easter candy market with holiday versions of theirregular products.   Hershey has packaged its chocolate Kisses in Easter _ andChristmas _ colors for years. Its recent acquisition of Cadbury's,which makes several popular chocolate Easter egg items, willincrease its seasonal sales considerably, company spokesman CarlAndrews said.   ``The company found that there's quite a market for specialpackaging for existing products,'' said analyst R. Bentley Offutt ofOffutt Securities Inc. in Maryland.   ``I can't tell you exactly what the incremental gain in sales hasbeen, but I do think it has surpassed their expectations by a largemargin,'' he said.   Mars, which together with Hershey controls most of the chocolatemarket, introduced red and green Mandamp;M type candies at Christmas threeyears ago, and last year added pastel versions at Easter.   ``The sales results were very, very successful,'' said Marsspokesman Hans Fiuczynski. ``The seasonal market certainly has beengrowing.''   Analysts and industry specialists said the chocolate giants'foray into the holiday market is not hurting the smaller, specialtyconfectioners.   ``The big guys are starting to pay attention to the season,''said Jan Kitt, associate publisher of The Confection magazine, basedin Orlando, Fla.   ``It's healthy for the market and provides a greater choice. ButI don't believe it's taking sales away from the traditional sellers.It's expanded the market.''   The specialty producers have been expanding their sales at thesame time as the mass marketers, Ms. Steuer said.   ``A lot of the importers are going to mass marketing outlets,''she said. ``The mass companies are going upscale and the upscalecompanies are going into mass marketing.''   There is plenty of room for both in the Easter market, Ms. Steuersaid.   ``It's really a matter of incremental business and expanding themarket,'' she said. ``I don't think anyone is pushing anybody out.''   ``We're going back to more traditional thinking in terms ofholidays,'' said Dick O'Connell, president of the ChocolateManufacturers Association, based in McLean, Va. ``More attention isbeing paid to chocolate bunnies and fancy Easter eggs and jellybeans _ all the things that go with Easter.   ``Easter's been doing very well.''</TEXT></DOC>
