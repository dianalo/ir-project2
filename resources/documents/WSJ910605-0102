Lerner contends the West Bank and Gazaare not &quot;occupied territories&quot; under international law. Hisargument, aimed at legitimizing the Israeli presence, has theparallel effect of undercutting legal safeguards designed toprotect Palestinians in the territories from abusive Israeliforces. Regardless of the legitimacy of the fact ofoccupation, Mr. Lerner is clearly wrong in suggesting Israelmight shirk the legal duties of occupation.   Mr. Lerner constructs his argument without ever mentioningthe Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949. Ratified by Israel and163 other nations, the convention details safeguards forpopulations under &quot;all cases of partial or total occupation.&quot;Israel denies the convention applies to the West Bank andGaza, but its position has been repudiated widely. The StateDepartment, in its most recent human-rights report,reiterated that &quot;{t}he United States considers Israel'soccupation to be governed by . . . the 1949 Fourth GenevaConvention.&quot; A 1975 U.N. Security Council resolution, passedwith U.S. support, &quot;reaffirms that the Geneva Convention . .. is applicable to all the Arab territories occupied byIsrael since 1967.&quot; The International Committee of the RedCross and most legal scholars share this view.</LP><TEXT>   Israel's refusal to concede that the convention applies tothe territories has had dire consequences for Palestinianresidents. While Israel says it voluntarily enforces theconvention's &quot;humanitarian&quot; rules, the list of breachedhumanitarian provisions is lengthy. Israel continues todeport Palestinians, despite the prohibition againstdeportations; it continues to punish families of securitysuspects by sealing and demolishing their homes, despite theban on collective punishment; it continues to jail securitysuspects within Israel, despite the requirement that suchoffenders be held in the territory under occupation; itcontinues to build settlements in the territories, despitethe prohibition against transferring any part of anoccupier's population to an occupied territory; it continuesto use &quot;limited . . . psychological and physical pressures&quot;during interrogation, to quote the words of an officialIsraeli report, despite the ban on &quot;physical or moralcoercion&quot;; and it continues to use lethal force againstunarmed and lightly armed participants in the Intifada,despite the ban on disproportionate violence.   Israel's acknowledgment and application of the duties ofoccupation are the minimum required by the international lawthat Mr. Lerner cites in his effort to legitimize the Israelipresence in the territories.
