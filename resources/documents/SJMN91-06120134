His family's home in anexclusive subdivision is up for sale. And Bush, 36, the third of PresidentBush's four sons, reportedly is negotiating with colleagues in Houston andDallas for a new job.;    A federal magistrate appointed by U.S. DistrictJudge Sherman Finesilver is to report back to the judge in the next few dayson the outcome of negotiations aimed at settling the last legal hurdle NeilBush faces in the long-playing case of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan.;   Magistrate Donald Abram was ordered to negotiate a settlement of a FederalDeposit Insurance Corporation lawsuit demanding that Bush and 12 other boardmembers and officers of the defunct Silverado repay the U.S. Treasury $200million. The FDIC says &quot;gross negligence&quot; by the board contributed toSilverado's failure.;    On April 18, the federal Office of Thrift Supervisionin Washington ruled that Bush had engaged in &quot;unsafe and unsound&quot; bankingpractices and had violated federal conflict-of-interest rules while serving onthe board of Silverado.;    The Denver-based thrift collapsed in 1988, and itis estimated the bailout will cost taxpayers $1 billion.;    After a 14-monthinvestigation, federal regulators found that Bush had improperly voted toapprove more than $100 million in loans and other deals for two men who werepaying his salary at JNB Explorations Inc., an oil company Bush headed beforestarting Apex in 1989.;    The regulators directed Bush to refrain from suchconduct in the future, one of the mildest penalties that could have beenimposed.;    The departure of the exceedingly well-connected oil speculatorand his civic-minded wife, Sharon, will leave a noticeable hole in Denversociety.;    The Bushes had moved to Colorado, according to an October articlein Vanity Fair, in hopes that Neil could make the same sort of killing inDenver's booming 1980s oil market that his father had made in thehard-scrabble oil-boom days in West Texas.;    But young Bush's last twobusiness ventures ended without showing a profit, leading to speculation thathe has little in assets while many of his co-defendants in the FDIC suitagainst Silverado remain multimillionaires. His Glenmoor home, which he hasacknowledged is in his wife's name &quot;for estate purposes,&quot; is heavilymortgaged.;    Steve Wilmsen, a Denver Post reporter who has just finished asoon-to-be-published book titled &quot;Silverado: Neil Bush and the Savings andLoan Crisis,&quot; said records in Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico and Ohioshow Bush and his partners drilled oil and gas wells without ever bringing inthe sort of gushers that propelled his father into a personal fortune.;   &quot;You can't fault Neil Bush for not trying,&quot; said Wilmsen. &quot;He really did tryto match his dad's performance. He dreamed not only of striking it rich in oilbut also of running for Congress. &quot;;    During a session with severalreporters last summer, Bush confirmed that he was considering running forCongress despite the negative publicity that came from the Silverado probe.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Chicago Tribune  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Denver  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910429  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  586  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday April 29, 199100120134,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
