On the New York Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange, coffee for May delivery rose 3.40 cents a pound to settle at $1.0765. After slight uneasiness early on, the May contract rallied as high as $1.0815 cents before profit-taking trimmed the advance.    An industry executive said the advance had little to do with the situation in physical coffee, which he described as basically bearish. &quot;They've been buying futures for the last three days, but no one can say specifically why,&quot; he said.    The recent buying has caused short covering, or buying back contracts traders previously sold, and the snowballing effect has pushed prices higher, the executive said. Currently &quot;futures are mostly a technical market,&quot; he said.    The executive discounted the possibility that some buying was to stockpile coffee ahead of July and August, when historically the Brazilian crop faces the greatest threat of damage from freezing temperatures. &quot;It's too early&quot; for such precautionary purchases, he said.    &quot;Roasters are pretty well supplied as far ahead as June,&quot; and by then the more than two million bags recently registered for May shipment from Brazil &quot;will be in this country, providing plenty of coffee at that time to protect&quot; against frost in Brazil, he said.    Also helping drive futures higher, industry executives said, was the continued circulation of an unfounded rumor that Colombia was going to close registrations of coffee for May shipment.    In fact, said an U.S. buyer, Colombian coffee is being sold as cheaply as five cents a pound or more below the May future, a situation that he described as &quot;unbelievable but a true indication of the condition of the market.&quot;    In other futures markets yesterday:    PRECIOUS METALS: Silver futures prices retreated after gains in five consecutive sessions, leading other precious metal prices lower. Analysts and traders attributed most of the price decline to profit-taking after the sharp run-up of the past two weeks, during which silver prices have soared more than 70 cents an ounce, or about 12%. Some analysts said silver's price weakness also stemmed from chart-guided technical factors. &quot;As soon as it dropped a couple of points, it touched off a sell signal,&quot; leading to accelerated price losses, said Sharon Ziemian, assistant vice president at Citibank, New York. On the Commodity Exchange, May silver contracts plunged 13 cents an ounce, to $6.635. Gold futures prices for April delivery on the Comex fell $2, to $420.20 an ounce, while platinum contracts for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed at $559.50 an ounce, down $7.60. Analysts and traders said that the stronger U.S. dollar against most major currencies helped depress gold contracts. Despite yesterday's losses, however, several analysts said concern about inflation likely will keep precious metals prices from falling significantly in the coming months.    STOCK INDEXES: Prices bounced back from Tuesday's depressed levels, helped by early strength in the dollar and some short-covering and bargain-hunting. June futures on the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index, which closed 7.65 points lower Tuesday, gained back 3.90 yesterday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average also recovered part of its big Tuesday loss. &quot;Any time somebody sees the market drop 20, 30, 40 points, they see it as a buying opportunity,&quot; Steve Tsang, stock-index strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York, said. Mr. Tsang said the apparent predictability of such recoveries makes him nervous. &quot;When people believe they can predict the market, they do strange things,&quot; he said.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Pork belly and hog futures prices were higher. A light slaughter compared with the expansion reported in last week's 10-state hog and pig report gave pork belly prices a boost, analysts said. The report, which noted a 3% increase in the total hog population, was veiwed as bearish by traders, who had been expecting tight supplies. However, neither the March slaughter figures, nor those since the report, has supported the data. Producers may be continuing the expansion by retaining animals for their breeding herds rather than sending them to slaughter, said Chuck Levitt, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in Chicago. Meanwhile, cattle futures were up slightly. </TEXT></DOC>
