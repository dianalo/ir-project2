But the company said it doesn't currently intend to marketthe version that received approval, and will instead seekclearance to market a more sophisticated device now intesting.</LP><TEXT>   Current technology requires blood samples to be withdrawnand analyzed in a hospital laboratory, with as much as ahalf-hour delay before the results are available, said aPuritan-Bennett official.   Puritan-Bennett has spent heavily to develop theintravascular device, which uses a catheter in the artery totake continuous measurements, and displays the readingsinstantly. The system would be used on patients during majorsurgery and in intensive-care units.   The device the FDA approved is a `two-parameter&quot; systemthat measures oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in thearterial blood.   The company said it is currently testing a three-parameterdevice that will additionally monitor the blood's pH, oracid-base ratio. &quot;Our current intention is to market only thethree-parameter system, which will require additional FDAclearance,&quot; the company said. Puritan-Bennett said it willfile for such clearance next month.   The clearance process was about six months for thetwo-parameter version, Puritan-Bennett said.</TEXT></DOC>
