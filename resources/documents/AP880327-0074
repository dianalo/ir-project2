Matthew West said as he climbed out ofa helicopter at the end of a flight from training exercises inJuticalpa, about 40 miles from the Honduran-Nicaraguan border.   ``Now we just want to get clean,'' said West, 21, from Dallas.   Soldiers from the 82nd Airbrone Division based at Fort Bragg,N.C., are expected to begin returning to the United States at about5 p.m. EST Monday. They will be the first to arrive home after an11-day training exercise meant as a show of U.S. military strengthin the Central America region.   Units of the 7th Light Infantry Division headquartered at FortOrd., Calif., also were flown here in the show of force.   President Reagan sent the 3,200 soldiers to Honduras on March17-18 after Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo asked for help.Azcona said an estimated 2,000 Nicaraguan troopers had enteredHonduran territory in the Bocay region.   Honduran military officials said the invading Sandinistas wereafter a major supply depot the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebelsmaintained just inside Honduras.   American soldiers said their mission was a success.   ``Our presence here definitely made a difference,'' said Sgt.Dale Taylor, 22, of Red Springs, N.C. ``It proves how serious weare about what we are doing and that we can get here in 18 hours ifthe need arises.''   The Reagan administration called the military action a trainingexercise, but it also was meant as a warning to the Sandinistasagainst further action inside Honduran territory.   And despite a few tense days during which the Honduran air forcetwice bombed Sandinista positions in the Bocay region of westernOlancho province, the U.S. soldiers were involved only in trainingmaneuvers.   The Sandinistas, while claiming their soldiers had never enteredHonduran territory, withdrew their troops from the area about twodays after the American troops arrived.   Taylor said he is one of the ``lucky ones'' who will be amongthe first to parachute into a training field at Ft. Bragg Monday.   ``It's going to be a sis-boom-bah occasion. They're going tohave a band and our families will be there. It's great to be goinghome,'' he said.   Pfc. Edward Broker, 27, of Denver, said he is going to ``kissthe ground'' when he gets back to Ft. Bragg and then drink a beer``and have my wife take me out to a restaurant.''   ``We're all glad to be going home,'' said Spec. 4 Michael Greco,21, of Pittsburgh, Pa. ``This makes you appreciate what you have athome,''   Maj. Gary Hovatter, the U.S. military spokesman for the forceshere, said all of the soldiers from Fort Bragg and Fort Ord shouldbe home by Wednesday.   He said some training continued Sunday at bases in Jamastran, ineastern Honduras, and Tamara in south-central Honduras.   ``Some of them will be leaving Monday night late. But then thelast guys probably won't be getting out until Wednesday,'' he said.``They want to make maximum use of all their training time.''</TEXT></DOC>
