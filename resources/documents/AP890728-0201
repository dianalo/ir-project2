The 300-member unicameral Parliament voted 170 to 119 in favorof setting up a 12-member committee to probe the allegations, madeby the center-right New Democracy Party. Five of the 294 deputiespresent abstained.   New Democracy is the dominant party in Greece'sconservative-Communist coalition government. Papandreou is aSocialist.   Once the committee is formed it has one month to investigate theallegations. If it finds that charges can be pressed, a specialhigh court will convene to try Papandreou.   Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement governed Greece foreight years until it was swept from power in June 18 elections, inwhich no party won a majority.   The Conservatives and the Communist-dominated Coalition of theLeft and Progress agreed to govern together for three months toclean up Greek politics.   But in a surprising move, the coalition voted againstinvestigating three former heads of the Ministry of Transport andCommunication.   ``The proposal for forming an investigative committee wasaccepted for Mr. Papandreou and rejected for the others,'' saidParliamentary speaker Athanassios Tsaldaris.   Papandreou, on a honeymoon with his new 35-year-old wife, wasnot in Parliament.   During the often stormy eight-hour debate, New Democracydeputies charged that Papandreou used facilities provided byGreece's National Intelligence Service and the state-run GreekTelecommunications Corporation to eavesdrop President ChristosSartzetakis, political foes and his own Cabinet ministers.   ``None of us ever compained about legal wiretaps, but there wasan unprecedented network eavesdropping on politicians, journalistsand even members of their party,'' New Democracy leader ConstatineMitsotakis said.   Parliament has ordered a committee to investigate allegationsthat Papandreou and other senior ministers were involved in a $210million fraud, forgery and embezzlement scandal.   The financial and wiretapping scandals as well as other chargesof official wrongdoing led to Papandreou's electoral defeat.   Socialist deputies have described the accusations againstPapandreou as ``fabrications'' and claim they are part of aconspiracy to destroy the party.</TEXT></DOC>
