What it wasn't, Roman Catholic Church officials concededThursday, was the burial cloth of Jesus Christ.   The history of the Shroud of Turin goes back only about 800years, when a crusading knight said he saw it in Constantinople. Itnever has been traced to the Holy Land.   The Catholic Church never claimed it was Jesus' burial cloth,and many critics have dismissed the linen cloth and its image as aclever forgery.   An early debunker was Pierre d'Arcis, bishop of Troyes. In a1389 letter, he told Clement VII, the papal claimant in Avignon,that the bishop who preceeded him in Troyes knew who painted it.   The shroud, bequeathed to the pope by ex-King Umberto II ofItaly upon his death in 1983, has been kept in the cathedral atTurin since 1578.   Through records, the shroud can be traced to Lirey in France in1354. In 1453, the royal family of Savoy got the shroud and kept itat the castle of Chambery, where fire damaged it in 1532.   There are references to a burial cloth of Christ as early as the5th or 6th centuries, and coincidences have been found between theshroud and 7th-century Byzantine art and liturgy.   Witnesses including William of Tyre in 1171 and Robert of Clariof the fourth crusade in 1203 reported seeing the shroud in theimperial palace at Constantinople. The trail then is lost until theshroud appears in France.   The official church position has been that the shroud was a``cherished object'' that must be given the respect due a relic.   Wrapped in red silk under protective glass and an iron grill,the shroud is kept on an altar in a silver chest that has onlyrarely been opened in the last century.   In an indication of the reverence accorded to the cloth, anestimated 3 million people came to view it in 1978 when it wasexhibited in Turin on the 400th anniversary of its arrival. It wasthe first time the shroud had been exhibited in 45 years.   Perhaps the most significant occasion was in 1898, when a mannamed Secundo Pia was allowed to photograph it.   The result was sensational.   The image on the shroud is similar to a photographic negative,so the negative on Pia's photographic plate gave the world itsfirst positive image of the man on the shroud.   Pia's work confounded skeptics: Why would a medieval forgerpaint a negative image _ an image that produced a perfect positivevisible only centuries later when photography was invented?   The mystery lived on, compounded by the Vatican's refusal foryears to allow the shroud to be tested. In 1986, Pope John Paul IIfinally gave the go-ahead for testing but only on snippets of thecloth, not on the image.   Scientists continued to produce theories concerning the shroud.In January 1982, Alan Whanger, a Duke University professor,compared images of Christ on a 6th century Byzantine icon and a 7thcentury coin with those on the shroud and said there wereastonishing similarities.   Whanger theorized that the icon and the coin were copied fromthe facial imprint on the shroud more than 800 years before thecloth turned up in France in the 14th century.   In March 1982, an Italian physician used the shroud to theorizethat Christ died of a heart attack on the cross and not ofsuffocation as previously believed.   Dr. Luigi Malantrucco said a large spot on the shroud was causedby blood and serum from profuse bleeding after Christ was stabbedby a soldier, as accounted in the Gospel according to St. John. IfChrist had earlier died of suffocation, then his blood would havecoagulated, Malantrucco said.   The shroud even was the subject of a 1986 Broadway musicaltitled ``Into the Light,'' focusing on the relationship between ayoung boy and his father, a research scientist investigating thecloth. Starring Dean Jones, the show opened to mostly negativenotices and closed after six performances and 14 previews</TEXT></DOC>
