BrowningStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP </IN><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The center-right coalition's victory in French parliamentary elections last year seemed a rejection of Socialist stewardship. Capitalism was sweeping France; laughter greeted any suggestion that Socialists might soon govern again.    Since then, the French have indeed taken to the free market. But a funny thing happened on the way to capitalism: Francois Mitterrand, the Socialist who remains France's president, has emerged as the most popular man in government. In fact, he has become one of the country's best-liked leaders since World War II, nearly on a level with the late President Georges Pompidou. Citizens call him tonton, a familiar word for uncle, and he seems to inspire confidence.    Mr. Mitterrand's return to popularity probably is the most remarkable comeback since Charles de Gaulle's founding of the Fifth Republic in 1958. Vilified earlier in his career as an opportunist, Mr. Mitterrand has slipped deftly into the role of revered elder statesman. The president, who could muster support from barely one-quarter of Frenchmen polled late in 1984, now regularly wins positive ratings from more than 55%. With presidential elections less than one year away, surveys now show him handily defeating all comers.    &quot;He's on the road to reelection,&quot; mopes a right-wing government minister.    If he does win, a black cloud would gather over the future of France's current free-market government. Some political insiders think Mr. Mitterrand might even try to appoint a moderate Socialist, such as former Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy, as prime minister, to rule in coalition with some centrists.    And while even the Socialists no longer seek sweeping economic intervention, as they did the last time they ran things, many of them want to re-regulate and renationalize parts of the French economy. (Which parts depend on which Socialists you talk to.) At the least, a 1988 Mitterrand victory would throw the conservatives into disarray and raise doubts about their ability to rule effectively.    The one thing beyond question is that recent months have been a personal triumph for Mr. Mitterrand. After more than 20 years opposing everything de Gaulle stood for, he has become for many voters a fitting occupant of the larger-than-life presidency the general invented in 1958.    Part of Mr. Mitterrand's popularity is due simply to the good luck, in a sense, of having lost the 1986 election. Few think there was much the center-right government could have done to stop the rise in unemployment. But the French have become morose as they watch their limping economy, and the press is full of debate about whether France is in a &quot;decline.&quot;    Yet as the government struggles, Mr. Mitterrand seems to float above the fray. He is helped by disputes and name-calling within the governing coalition that is split by the presidential ambitions of at least three center-right politicians. Being out of power has advantages.    But skill also counts. Since the 1986 legislative election, he has shown why many consider him the wiliest French politician. He avoids confrontation, and gives the center-right government plenty of rope to hang itself. He intervenes only when he can cite constitutional grounds -- demanding parliamentary debate on basic economic changes, for example, or speaking out on security issues. All this reinforces the image of a wise but somewhat removed leader -- just what France prefers.    Frustrated center-right leaders now attack Mr. Mitterrand for being partisan. But the president lets political supporters respond, making himself seem even more statesman-like.    He still has time to stumble. Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing also looked strong until six months before the 1981 election, which he lost to Mr. Mitterrand. Some politicians think the 70-year-old president, watching Ronald Reagan's troubles, would prefer to retire.    But many opponents think he will be in the race. Through years of effort, Francois Mitterrand personally rebuilt the once-dormant Socialist Party and crushed the Communists, who once outpolled it. With the right feuding, he stands apart, the undisputed leader of the left. The 1988 election is his reward for that effort, and it is hard to imagine him missing it. </TEXT></DOC>
