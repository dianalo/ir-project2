Glath, president of RG Software, told Newsbytesthat, contrary to other reports in the media (including an Associated Pressreport this week), the Datacrime virus wipes out data by reformatting a harddisk after October 12 and is also called the Columbus Day virus.andP;  This is notthe same as the Icelandic virus which infects EXE files or the Friday the13th virus which infects COM files and is activated on Friday the 13th of ANYmonth.andP;  The December Fu Manchu virus is the next on the horizon, a programwhich corrupts all COM files except the COMMAND.COM file on MS-DOS computers,causing random rebooting.andP;  The virus can also write comments to various filesbut apparently doesn't directly corrupt data files.andP;  VI-spy is available fromRG Software, Inc., 2300 Computer Ave., Suite E28, Willow Grove, Pennsylvania19090, U.S.A.andP;  215-659-5300.andP;  An upgrade service costing $150 givessubscribers free updates as new virus programs are detected and incorporatedin VI-spy.andP;  (John McCormick/19890922/Press Contact: Beverly Ann Glath, RG,215-659-5300)</TEXT></DOC>
