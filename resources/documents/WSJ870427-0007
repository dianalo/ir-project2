The increase in the Labor Department's consumer price index, which translates to a 5.1% compound annual rate, included big rises for housing, apparel and energy together with smaller increases for most other goods. It followed an increase of 0.4%, or a 5.2% annual rate, in February.    Separately, the Commerce Department said personal income edged up 0.2% last month after rising a revised 1.3% in February. The February increase was originally reported as 0.9%. The figures were distorted by unusually large swings in subsidy payments to farmers, however. If these are excluded, income rose 0.4% in March and 0.7% the month before.    Consumer spending increased 0.3% in March after a revised rise of 2.4% in February. The February increase was previously put at 1.7%.    The price report presented a disturbing picture to economists who have been watching for signs that the drop in the dollar is having a broad effect on domestic prices. A lower dollar raises the price of imports and makes exports more competitive.    &quot;Inflation is getting a bit more widespread,&quot; said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University. &quot;There are no soft spots and that's a little bit discouraging. Everything is going a bit higher.&quot;    He said an &quot;inflation psychology&quot; is building as import prices rise and foreign competition diminishes. He suggested, for example, that rising prices for imported cars are leading to increased demand -- and higher prices -- for used cars.    Michael Penzer, senior economist at Bank of America in San Francisco, said, &quot;The inflation picture looks a bit worse than I had earlier anticipated. Higher import prices are beginning to affect the core rate of inflation.&quot; He pointed to the rise in prices excluding food and energy. Those have begun increasing more rapidly than the overall index after trailing it in January and February. Last month that measure rose 0.5% after a 0.3% increase in February.    Energy prices were up a hefty 1% after a 1.9% increase the month before; food fell 0.1% after a 0.2% increase. The prices of fruits and vegetables and non-alcoholic beverages dropped sharply.    Apparel prices jumped 1.7% after a 0.7% rise. Transportation costs, reflecting a sharp rise in gasoline prices, were up 0.6% after a 0.5% rise. The department's index of shelter costs rose 0.5% after a 0.5% rise the month before.    The figures in both reports are seasonally adjusted. Before seasonal adjustment, the consumer price index rose 0.4% to 335.9% of its 1967 average, up 3% from a year earlier. Effective with the January figure, the department has revised the index to reflect new consumer spending patterns and population shifts, among other things. For comparison purposes, the department said the old index also rose 0.4% before adjustment in March.    The index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, a measure that includes half the number of people covered by the broader index and is used in adjusting Social Security and other retirement benefits, rose 0.5% in March after rising 0.4% in February. On an unadjusted basis, this index rose 0.5% to 330.5% of its 1967 average, up 2.8% from a year earlier.    On income, several economists said a weak gain was expected in light of the meager rise in payroll employment last month. Wages and salaries rose 0.3% in March after a 0.8% rise in February. Factory wages, however, fell 0.3% after a 0.5% gain.    Sandra Shaber, a consumer economist at the Futures Group here, said the modest spending rise underscores the erosion of consumers' purchasing power that is occurring as a result of higher prices and small income gains. While she acknowledged that March spending was probably reduced because Easter came in April this year, she predicted &quot;a period of slow growth in consumer spending for most of this year.&quot;    Last month the savings rate remained unchanged at 3.4% of after-tax income. A spending-based price measure that is reported after a one-month lag increased 0.3% in February after rising 0.8% in January.    The March increase brought income to a $3.604 trillion annual rate from a $3.599 trillion pace in February. Spending increased to a $2.883 trillion rate from a $2.874 trillion pace.    In a third report, the Labor Department said that the average weekly earnings of U.S. workers fell 0.7% in March after adjustment for inflation and seasonal factors. These earnings increased a revised 0.4% in February and 0.1% in January. Previously the department said earnings rose 0.6% in February and were practically unchanged in January.    The latest drop in average weekly earnings reflected a 0.3% rise in average hourly earnings and a 0.6% drop in hours worked.    Weekly earnings of U.S. workers averaged $309.37, after adjustment for seasonal factors but not for inflation, down from $310.10 in February. Before seasonal adjustment, average weekly earnings rose to $307.94 from $306.71.    Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the Labor Department's consumer price index for March.                                         % change from                                      Feb.
