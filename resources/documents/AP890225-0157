It'salso warning banks to more aggressively monitor their lending fordebt-financed takeovers.   A spike in the Fed's key discount rate loan fee and its otheranti-inflationary moves this past week came as the nation's centralbank took another important step: The Fed implemented tightenedguidelines for banks, specifying which debt-financed acquisitionsmight be too risky for them.   Under these guidelines, loans to borrowers with debt that is morethan triple their equity are considered ``highly leveragedfinancings,'' which means they probably will face increased scrutinyby federal bank examiners.   It also means that bank lending in the unprecedented onslaught ofcorporate acquisitions financed largely by debt will decline,takeover experts speculated.   In addition, the guidelines instruct bankers to carefully assesstheir companywide exposure in debt-financed takeovers beforecommitting to additional loans for such activity.   Banks increasingly have become important financiers of thetakeover tactic known as the leveraged buyout or LBO, in which abuyer borrows most of the purchase money for a company and repays itthrough the company's earnings, asset sales or a combination of both.   A 1988 Fed survey suggested that 15 percent of commercial andindustrial loans were related to LBOs and other types of takeoversand at some big banks the figure was as high as 40 percent.   One reason banks have plunged into the LBO business is the highrate of interest they may charge for the loans. The growing risk,however, is that a substantial portion of these loans could defaultif the debt-burdened borrowers face a downturn in their business.   Fed regulators, sensitive to how many banks recklessly loanedmoney to Third World nations and speculative Southwest real estateventures in years past, are concerned that the LBO binge is deja vu.   They also are particularly mindful of the crisis plaguing thesavings and loan industry, which has left many thrifts insolvent dueto risky loans that went bad. The crisis has bankrupted the federalagency that insures thrifts and could cost more than $100 billion ingovernment bailout assistance.   Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said he was troubled by banklending for LBOs late last year after a spree of multibillion dollardeals was announced, including the record $24.53 billion takeover ofRJR Nabisco Inc.   While Greenspan did not suggest the government restrict suchtakeovers, he said banks carefully should evaluate their involvementin them.   Even if U.S. banks cut their exposure to LBO-related loansbecause of the new Fed guidelines, some experts believe that won'tdeter the pace of debt-financed takeovers. There are many otheralternate sources of financing, including Wall Street investmentfirms and foreign banks.   ``I can understand why the Fed did this but it's misguided,''said Yakov Amihud, a professor of finance and LBO expert at New YorkUniversity's Leonard N. Stern School of Business. ``Bankparticipation will decline but others will jump into the void.''   In other business and economic news this past week:   _Fears of inflation intensified, particularly because of a LaborDepartment report that showed consumer prices surged 0.6 percent inJanuary, the biggest rise in two years. Financial markets slumpedand banks raised their prime lending rate to a four-year high of11.5 percent.   _More trouble befell the airline industry. Machinists andmanagement at money-losing Eastern airlines hurtled toward a March 4strike, with conflicting signals from pilots over who they wouldsupport. An airborne United Airlines Boeing 747 lost a chunk offuselage, sucking out several passengers. Air Canada said two of itsBoeing 767s contained crossed wiring, a defect that federal aviationofficials have called a safety hazard. Counteracting bad news atBoeing was a $3.15 billion order for new 747s by All Nippon Airways.   _Textile giant West Point-Pepperell Inc. capitulated in a hostiletakeover fight with underwear maker William Farley, who will buy thecompany for nearly $3 billion. Elsewhere, Texas Eastern Corp. agreedto a $3.22 billion takeover from Panhandle Eastern Corp.; ChampionSpark Plug Co. agreed to an $800 million takeover by CooperIndustries Inc.; and Emhart Corp. received a $2.2 billion takeoveroffer from an investor group that included oil heir Gordon Getty.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for weekend editions Feb. 25-26.</NOTE></DOC>
