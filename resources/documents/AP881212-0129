Many analysts said the Fed has already begun to tighten creditconditions and they predicted that its Federal Open Market Committeewill vote for more restrictive policies at closed-door strategysessions Tuesday and Wednesday.   Analysts said they based this belief on the fact that recenteconomic statistics have pointed to an economy still barrelingahead, with inflationary pressures rising.   Unemployment, at 5.4 percent in November, is close to 14-yearlows, leading many economists to worry that tight labor markets andhigh factory operating rates will trigger price increases asproduction constraints bump up against high demand.   ``The data on growth and inflation clearly suggest the need forfurther tightening,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of theBoston Co. in New York.   Major banks boosted their prime lending rate two weeks ago to10.5 percent, the fourth increase this year and the highest levelfor this benchmark business and consumer rate since mid-1985.   Many economists said they were looking for the prime rate to moveup to 11 percent by late January, with similar increases in otherinterest rates.   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co., agovernment securities dealer, said he expects mortgage rates thataveraged 10.46 percent for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages last weekto climb.   ``By early next year, I would look for mortgage rates to bearound 11 percent to 11.25 percent and rising,'' he said. ``Mortgageborrowers should borrow now instead of waiting.''   Many economists said they were looking for another rise in banks'prime lending rate, but some said they did not think it would occuruntil the Fed hikes its discount rate, a move they predicted wouldoccur by late January.   An increase in the discount rate _ the interest the central bankcharges on loans to member commercial banks _ is the most dramaticsignal the Fed can send of its intention to push interest rateshigher as a way of slowing an overheated economy.   The Fed last hiked the discount rate on Aug. 9, pushing it to 6.5percent. That move capped a series of less-noticeable credittightening steps the central bank had begun in late March.   The Fed can also influence interest rates by selling U.S.Treasury securities to banks, reducing the amount of money the bankshave to support their loan activities. This drives up the cost ofthose loans, interest rates.   Many analysts say they have detected signs that the Fed is onceagain tightening credit behind the scenes. They note that thefederal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other forovernight loans, has been rising. It averaged 8.59 percent lastweek, the highest weekly average in two years and up from 8.44percent the week before.   Some analysts, however, argued that the rise in the federal fundsrate had occurred because of increased borrowing demand and not fromany overt tightening by the Fed. But regardless of the reason,analysts said they expected the central bank would go along with thetrend toward higher interest rates in coming weeks.   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ``is a gradualist and Ithink we will see lots of small steps toward higher rates,'' saidDavid Wyss, chief financial economist for Data Resources Inc. inLexington, Mass.   An effort to fight inflation by boosting interest rates is notlikely to sit well with President-elect Bush, who is counting onrobust economic growth to generate the higher government revenues heneeds to balance the budget without raising taxes.   Higher interest rates worsen the deficit in two ways. They holddown economic growth and drive up the federal government's ownborrowing costs. Interest on the $2.6 trillion national debt is nowthe third-highest government spending category behind defense andthe programs in the Department of Health and Human Services.   The Fed is projecting economic growth, as measured by the grossnational product, of around 2 percent to 2.5 percent, far below theReagan administration's forecast of 3.5 percent GNP growth next year.   The Bush administration is likely to adopt the Reagan economicforecast when it presents its own budget blueprint to Congressbecause the higher growth forecast lowers the need for painfulbudget cuts to erase the deficit.   ``I think the Fed believes we are at full employment and we can'ttolerate strong growth any longer and it is time to hit thebrakes,'' Wyss said. ``That means the administration's job in termsof balancing the budget will be much harder.''   The Federal Open Market Committee is composed of members of theFederal Reserve Board and presidents of its regional banks and meetsevery six to eight weeks. Its decisions at those private sessionsare not disclosed until after the next meeting is held.</TEXT></DOC>
