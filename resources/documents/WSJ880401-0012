In unprecedented numbers, white blue-collar workers are supporting his campaign. He taps the same working-class identity once mined by his old nemesis George Wallace, but he substitutes hope for the anger of the former Alabama governor.    &quot;It's not an angry vote, it's a happy vote,&quot; says Jerry Landwehr, a Catholic blue-collar union leader who supported Mr. Wallace in the early 1970s. &quot;Jesse Jackson is taking a stand for working-class people in this country.&quot;    Wisconsin's Democratic primary Tuesday will test this appeal. Scores of other labor leaders like Mr. Landwehr are backing the Rev. Jackson, who seeks to build an urban-rural alliance with hard-pressed farmers in Wisconsin's western and northern counties.    In a state where blacks represent only 3% of the population, polls and political analysts give Mr. Jackson at least an even chance of beating Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. Eighty-one Democratic delegates are at stake, and the two men, who lead the Democratic field in delegates won, are both looking for a boost going into the New York primary April 19.    To a greater extent than Michigan, where the Rev. Jackson swamped the party caucuses last weekend with a huge black vote, Wisconsin will turn on his appeal to whites.    He hopes to capture the workers previously targeted by Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, who withdrew from the Democratic race this week and whose Wisconsin chairman endorsed Mr. Jackson yesterday. Mr. Jackson's ability to win these workers' support will directly affect not only Mr. Dukakis but also Tennessee's Sen. Albert Gore: The governor has yet to beat the Rev. Jackson in an industrial state outside New England; Sen. Gore, who ranks third in total delegates, must begin to show movement if he is to have any chance of being truly competitive in New York.    The prospect of crossover votes by Wisconsin Republicans, who no longer have a real contest of their own, adds to the stakes in a fight no Democrat can afford to play down. Gov. Dukakis is committing more time to Wisconsin after failing to campaign vigorously in Michigan, and the Rev. Jackson is showing new muscle from his improved finances. He is assured of television ads in the final days, and workers from Minnesota will cross into western Wisconsin this weekend with an estimated 35,000 campaign tabloids aimed at rural voters.    His labor support owes much to relationships built since his 1984 campaign, and whether here in De Pere or in the union halls of Kenosha and Cudahy, Mr. Jackson is welcomed as a familiar figure with proven credentials. He is the only remaining Democratic candidate with the experience of having run for president before, and he is perceived as a risk-taker who will stand with -- and not just for -- workers.    Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, the fourth Democrat in the field, has met little success among Kenosha auto workers despite his long experience with labor legislation, and a Gore ad capitalizing on the scheduled closing of a Chrysler plant had a hollow ring next to Mr. Jackson's involvement in the bitter dispute.    &quot;He stood with us, and we're going to stand with him,&quot; says Rudy Kuzel, president of the United Auto Workers local at Kenosha. And in Cudahy, the Rev. Jackson retraced his steps this week to St. Frederick Church, where he stopped briefly a year ago in a Palm Sunday march for striking meatpackers.    In a new Easter season, beneath a massive white-figured crucifix, the black preacher led first children and then parents in the chant, &quot;Come alive April Five, Vote Jackson.&quot; He told the cheering gathering, &quot;America is great enough, America is good enough, to provide jobs for its people.&quot;    Instead of the economic nationalism identified with Mr. Gephardt, the Rev. Jackson speaks of unity with foreign labor. He downplays the importance of national borders in favor of a greater sense of community and the individual.    &quot;We are a giant nation, but we are 6% of the world,&quot; he tells students in south Milwaukee in pronouncing their racially mixed high school a microcosm of the diversity of the world. &quot;We must grow,&quot; he says. &quot;Be bigger people, be better people.&quot;    It is a style that suits both the progressive traditions of Wisconsin politics and the modern alienation of workers worried about economic and social threats to their families. Mr. Jackson won the endorsement this week of the Madison Capital-Times in liberal Dane County. White ethnic parents hear themselves in his lectures on drugs and teen-age pregnancy.    &quot;You aren't an amoeba,&quot; he says. &quot;You have more than one cell. You can have more than one thrill.&quot;    He offers more rhymes than specifics, but when his audiences are asked, it is &quot;specifics&quot; they say they hear in his rhetoric.    &quot;He is talking about the issues that affect people,&quot; says Joseph Gruber, executive vice president for the state AFL-CIO. &quot;They can't relate to the other candidates. Jesse gives them hope.&quot;    &quot;Glad to be an American,&quot; says a 28-year-old Milwaukee machinist in describing his emotions after hearing the Rev. Jackson. Norman Kempen, 57 and out of work for 10 months in a bitter strike at a De Pere paper mill, remembers Mr. Jackson's visit this winter and awaits his return at a rally here late today.    &quot;He makes me feel good,&quot; Mr. Kempen says.    If Gov. Dukakis is Mr. Jackson's chief rival for the labor vote, Sen. Gore appears to be most aggressively courting rural counties. Farmers in western and upstate Wisconsin helped another Southerner, Jimmy Carter, defeat the liberal Rep. Morris Udall in the 1976 Democratic primary, and Sen. Gore is promising substantial increases in federal subsidies and consideration of a two-tier milk price system directing benefits to owners of small or medium-sized dairy herds.    The senator, who has reclaimed his old ties to former Democratic Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota, is scheduled to campaign through Monday in Wisconsin. But he can't rival the immense visibility enjoyed by the Rev. Jackson. In the small town of Amery, Wis., depressed by last summer's drought and the loss of its major manufacturing employer, a rally is scheduled today on a 600-acre dairy farm, and Jackson organizers hope to duplicate the large crowds their candidate drew in rural Michigan.    In the blue-collar city of Sheboygan, an estimated 2,000 people filled an armory to hear Mr. Jackson yesterday. And in a rally reminiscent of the 1960s, he spoke to as many as 4,000 people at the University of Wisconsin field house at Oshkosh.    The senator could be helped by Republicans and independents who would have voted in the GOP contest if Sen. Bob Dole were still running against Vice President George Bush. But the size of this crossover vote is difficult to measure.    &quot;There's going to be an element of it, but not enough to make a difference,&quot; says Richard Haney, a history professor at the University of Wisconsin at White Water.    But those in the GOP who hope to cause mischief among the Democrats by voting for Mr. Jackson might be reminded of a similar Democratic tactic employed in 1946. In that election, Progressive Sen. Robert LaFollette was moving back into the GOP, and Democrats crossed over to help someone they thought would be a weaker rival -- Joseph McCarthy. Mr. LaFollette lost; and so did the Democrats when Mr. McCarthy went on to defeat their candidate, Howard McMurray, in the fall.    ---                  Democratic Delegate Count                               ASSOCIATED          NBC                                    PRESS         NEWS    Dukakis                        652.55          676    Jackson                        642.55          652    Gore                           367.8           369    Simon                          169.5           187    Uncommitted                    484.6           171    Needed to nominate: 2,082</TEXT></DOC>
