CarlLevin, D-Mich., said shortly after the Senate reversed fieldThursday and restored two-thirds of the money it had cut for StarWars.   ``It doesn't represent an increase in support for Star Wars,''Levin said.   The dramatic 53-47 vote on the Strategic Defense Initiative,commonly known as Star Wars, was capped by final passage earlytoday of the $288 billion military spending bill.   The vote on the overall bill was 96-2 with Sens. Mark Hatfield,R-Ore., and Kent Conrad, D-N.D., voting against the legislation andSens. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., notvoting.   The spending bill, adopted after four days of debate, includesthe following provisions:   _Elimination of all $1.8 billion for procurement of the Trident2 missile but an increase of $70 million to Bush's request of $216million for research and development of the submarine-launchedweapon. The Senate action came more than one month after a Trident2 missile exploded seconds after being launched from the nuclearsubmarine Tennessee.   _Endorsement of Bush's request of $1.1 billion for themultiple-warhead, rail-garrison MX missile and $100 million for thesingle-warhead, Midgetman missile.   _General approval of the B-2 stealth bomber, the bat-wingedaircraft considered the most expensive in history at $530 million acopy.   _Endorsement of a plan to shut down 86 domestic military basesand scale down five more.   _Funding of $255 million for research and development on theMarine Corps' V-22 Osprey, the vertical-takeoff plane the Bushadministration sought to cancel.   House and Senate members will meet in conference next week tothrash out a final version of the appropriations bill.   On Star Wars, the Senate approved a total of $4.3 billion andgave members of the Senate Armed Services Committee more room tomaneuver in talks with the House.   The Senate, in approving its authorization bill last month,approved $4.5 billion for Star Wars; the House adopted a fundinglevel of $3.1 billion.   Lack of progress on a final version gave way to confident Housemembers indicating Thursday morning that they would not accept aStar Wars funding level higher than $3.5 billion. Their argument:The Senate vote Tuesday night in which the chamber slashed $900million from the missile defense shield.   ``It shot a hole in the poor Senate position. Take that, SamNunn,'' Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a member of the HouseArmed Services Committee, said Wednesday.   But Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who chairs the Senate ArmedServices Committee, would not stand for having his bargainingposition undercut. He easily gained the support of the keyRepublicans, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole and Sen. John Warnerof Virginia, ranking GOP member on the Armed Services Committee,and took his case to the Senate.   ``I am not a cheerleader for SDI. I always voted to cut some ofthe program,'' Nunn told his colleagues. ``But I also felt it was avaluable research program.''   ``We're not going to negotiate between $3.7 billion and $2.8billion. Where does that leave us?'' Nunn said. ``Maybe we'll sithere until Thanksgiving. Maybe we'll do that. ... I'm convinced theonly way to do it is to send a signal to the House conferees.''   But Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., questioned whether senatorsreally believe the House is ``weak-willed and weak-minded'' andwouldn't know ``what's going on here.''   However, the amendment prevailed and the Senate negotiators onthe authorization bill laid claim to what they believe is astronger hand in the conference.   ``Once we determined the conference depended on it (Star Wars),the strength developed,'' Warner said. ``It's cyclical. We'reconcluding this day on a high note.''   But there was a note of dissent from some lawmakers.   ``Part of the bargaining strategy was a close Senate vote forimproving our bargaining position. Whether it succeeds remains tobe seen,'' said Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., a member of the ArmedServices Committee and SDI supporter who noted that congressmenwon't be ``fooled over there.''</TEXT></DOC>
