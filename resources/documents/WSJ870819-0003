GreenbergerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/19/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTEXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Reagan administration official said that Iran ordered American journalist Charles Glass's kidnapping, and he speculated that Tehran also was involved in Mr. Glass's escape from the shadowy world of Lebanon.    At the same time, another senior administration official said that the U.S. plans to restore full diplomatic relations with Syria, which, at the behest of the U.S., pressured Iran into working to release the hostage.    The U.S. official, who is familiar with the Glass case, said, &quot;We're confident Iran ordered his (Mr. Glass's) kidnapping&quot; two months ago. But he said he believed that Tehran, concerned about its growing isolation in the Arab world, decided that Mr. Glass should be freed as a goodwill gesture toward the Arabs and because of growing pressure from Syria.    Mr. Glass, in an interview with ABC-TV from Damascus, Syria, said he believes his captors were Shiite Moslems who held him in an apartment building in the Bir Al Abed area of southern Beirut. The area is a stronghold for the Shiite Hezbollah terrorist group, which is heavily influenced by Iran. But Mr. Glass discounted speculation that he had been freed, insisting he had escaped.    After making his way to a Beirut hotel, Mr. Glass was taken by Syrian security men and soldiers to Damascus, where he was handed over to the American Embassy, according to wire reports. The Reagan administration said it was &quot;grateful to the government of Syria for its efforts&quot; on behalf of Mr. Glass.    The U.S. last October withdrew its ambassador from Syria as part of a series of steps to protest Syrian involvement in terrorism. Washington had been asking Damascus to help free American hostages being held in Beirut, and a senior administration official said late yesterday, after Mr. Glass was turned over to the American officials, that the U.S. planned to send its envoy back to Damascus.    U.S. analysts believe Syria has become more cooperative on the terrorism issue in part to improve its relations with the U.S. and other Western nations and in part because of its broader competition with Iran for control in Lebanon.    The U.S. official was skeptical that Mr. Glass had escaped. He said that by allowing their captive to think he had escaped, the kidnappers could maintain &quot;plausible deniability&quot; that they had released him. &quot;We may never know,&quot; he added. &quot;Charles Glass may never know.&quot;    The official speculated that Tehran may have wanted Mr. Glass freed to soften the wrath it has incurred in much of the Arab world because of the riots it instigated in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and because of its apparent mining of waterways in -- and recently just outside -- the Persian Gulf. Most moderate Arab states have opposed such acts of belligerence by Iran.    Tehran tried to blame the Mecca incident on Saudi guards, but most Arab nations hold Iran responsible for the violence that took place at the Moslem holy site. The mining of waters outside the Persian Gulf for the first time in the seven-year Iran-Iraq war is believed to be in response to the presence of U.S. Navy ships, which are escorting Kuwaiti oil tankers through the gulf.    The U.S. official added, however, that he didn't think Iran sought Mr. Glass's release as a positive gesture to the U.S. He noted that Iranian-controlled Shiite groups still hold eight American captives, and that Tehran's goal remains to drive the U.S. out of the Mideast.    The official labeled as &quot;nonsense&quot; a report on Mr. Glass's release in Mideast Report, a New York-based newsletter. The report suggested the Iranians arranged the release as a friendly gesture to President Reagan. It said the Iranians approached the State Department's chief legal officer, Abraham Sofaer, earlier this summer with an offer to pay the kidnappers several million dollars for Mr. Glass's release. Mr. Sofaer, who is on vacation, couldn't be reached for comment.    Despite the apparent Iranian involvement in the Glass kidnapping, there isn't any talk among U.S. officials of retaliation against Tehran.    Meanwhile, United Press International, quoting shipping sources, reported that patrol boats thought to be Iranian fired missiles at a Liberian-registered chemical tanker in the Gulf of Oman. If so, the attack would be the first by Iran outside of the Persian Gulf.    A convoy of oil tankers is assembled in the Persian Gulf waiting to be escorted by U.S. Navy ships in what has become a hazardous journey out of the gulf and through the Strait of Hormuz. </TEXT></DOC>
