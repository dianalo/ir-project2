Iran was lone holdout at an informal meeting of 11 of the 13Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said sources whospoke on condition of anonymity. Iraq and Libya did not attend.   OPEC officials planned to try to persuade Iran to join thearrangement, which would lift the cartel's quotas temporarily topermit increased production by countries with additional productioncapability.   The ministers were expected to meet Tuesday to endorse the plan.   Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have said they intend to pump moreoil to help make up for the shortfall of 4 million barrels a daycaused by the international embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. U.N.sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.   The officials were trying to come up with an ``understanding''that would sanction output increases by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela andothers to help offset losses to the world market caused by thecrisis, said senior delegate sources.   ``Most countries have already agreed to sanction productionincreases for the simple reason that . . . (the countries) aregoing to do it anyway,'' said one source.   ``If they do it outside OPEC, it may be difficult to have themback in the mold again.''   A source close to OPEC said it appeared Saudi Arabia, theworld's largest crude exporter, has already increased oilproduction to meet the extra demand. But he refused to give details.   Figures obtained Monday from the U.S. Energy InformationAdministration estimate Saudi Arabia's production at 6 millionbarrels of oil per day, 600,000 more than its OPEC quota of 5.4million barrels.   In Venezuela, the government said a 90-hour shutdown of one ofits oil installations began Monday as that country prepared toincrease production.   A subsidiary of the state oil monopoly Petroleos de Venezuelashut down a site to increase production capacity there from 180,000barrels per day to 220,000 barrels per day, the government newsagency Venpres said.   Venezuela's OPEC quota is 1.95 million barrels a day. Quotaswere set last month under a production accord worked out by the 13producer nations. That agreement sets an overall output ceiling of22.5 million barrels a day in the last half of the year.   Iran has fought lifting the quotas. Iranian Oil MinisterGholamreza Aqazadeh, taking a break from closed-door discussions,said Monday ``it is not necessary'' now to boost output, ``butmaybe in the future.''   Iran says enough excess oil is stored in the industrializedworld to make up for any shortages.   Libyan officials were also expected to argue against any move toraise production. A Libyan delegation may arrive Tuesday for theconsultations with OPEC President Sadek Boussena, the Algerian oilminister, sources said.   Resentment has surfaced at what some nations view as politicalpressure on the group from the United States, the world's largestoil importer, to lift production.   Delegate sources said some countries received calls fromAmerican officials before the meeting asking questions about theirpositions.   ``We cannot be pressured,'' said one source, demanding anonymity.   Any arrangement to permit higher pumping would likely includepromises that production be reduced once the crisis ends, accordingto the sources.   It also would probably call on consuming nations to take stepsto use oil in storage to help meet any shortages, they said.   Another source suggested the talks might end with those nationswanting to boost output issuing a statement on their own, withoutthe cartel's backing.   There also seemed to be some support for a solution that wouldnot require a formal statement _ or even a formal meeting.   Crude prices surged last week above $30 a barrel on fears ofmilitary escalation and a shortage of crude supplies in theoil-rich gulf region. But they plummeted Monday, with a barrel oflight sweet crude for October delivery dropped $4 to close at$26.91 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   The OPEC nations are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United ArabEmirates and Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
