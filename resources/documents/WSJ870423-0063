A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed that the public, by a wide 59% to 31% margin, thinks that the 1984 dismantling of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. has been a &quot;bad thing.&quot;    Yet, while regulation is reviving in such areas as transportation and worker safety, deregulation of the telephone system is moving full speed ahead.    A major reason: Despite the grumbling, there hasn't been any public outcry that would force a slowing of phone decontrol. &quot;It depends on whether you can get the public to care,&quot; says Rep. Al Swift (D., Ore.), a member of the House telecommunications subcommittee. &quot;In the past, everybody has yawned.&quot;    Some experts say that because of sweeping technological changes the telecommunications industry couldn't be re-regulated even if people wanted. But the continuing decontrol in this area also shows that the regulatory resurgence is selective. While rules are revived to deal with publicized concerns such as air and rail safety, the government pullback continues in such areas as consumer protection and antitrust enforcement.    Telephone issues are dense and esoteric, scaring off legislators and the general public. &quot;Consumers don't want to be bothered with their telephones,&quot; says Samuel Simon, a Washington activist on telephone issues.    This indifference may reflect a sense of relief. When the Bell System was broken up in January 1984 as a result of a government antitrust suit, critics routinely warned that residential telephone rates would double. While many local rates have increased sharply, Bethesda Research Institute Ltd., a Washington-area research company, estimates that the typical overall telephone rate, including offsetting cuts in long-distance costs, has risen a more modest 13% during the three-year period. And the Federal Communications Commission this week reported that intrastate phone rates, including local calls and in-state long distance, dropped in the first quarter of 1987 -- the first decline since the breakup of ATandamp;T.    Meanwhile the introduction of ever faster computer power and ever cheaper methods of transmission has weakened the ability of any company to dominate the telecommunications industry -- and the ability of any government agency to regulate it. &quot;In the long term, technology makes nonsense of regulatory constraints,&quot; says Peter Huber, a Justice Department telecommunications consultant.    Decontrol backers argue that phone users ultimately will benefit with a host of new telephone services, perhaps including travel information, opinion polling, burglar-alarm systems, videotext and electronic yellow pages.    In the short term, however, telecommunications is still bound in a web of regulation, with jurisdiction split among federal regulators, state regulators and the federal courts. On the federal level, the FCC and the Reagan administration are pushing for greater freedom for ATandamp;T and its offspring. &quot;Our ultimate goal is a (telephone) network which will have the latest technology and will be responsive to demand, rather than responsive to the FCC,&quot; says Dennis Patrick, the new FCC chairman.    Many state regulators also advocate loosening restrictions, and have moved faster than the FCC. ATandamp;T estimates that about three-quarters of the states have granted it greater flexibility since the divestiture, including 11 that have stopped regulating its profit margins. The FCC now only is beginning to debate relaxing profit-margin regulation.    Congress can influence the FCC when it focuses on an issue. The agency recently scaled back plans to raise certain residential rates by $2 a month, making the boost $1.50 instead, after objections from influential lawmakers.    But Congress rarely stands in the way. Earlier this year, the FCC deregulated the installation and repair of telephone wiring, without opposition from lawmakers, although service rates may increase in some states.    Congress and the FCC are allies in one leading deregulation battle. Both urged federal Judge Harold Greene, who has authority over the regional Bell companies, to let the companies into manufacturing and computerized services, areas from which they are now banned. He is scheduled to rule this summer.    Judge Greene, who helped push through the ATandamp;T breakup, has been skeptical of the need of the regional companies to diversify. His central role angers turf-conscious legislators, who argue that telecommunications authority ought to reside in the FCC, which is subject to congressional oversight. And that anger may spur Congress to act.    Last year, a House measure to strip Judge Greene of much of his telecommunications authority garnered 170 co-sponsors, but wasn't voted on. &quot;Members are very concerned about court involvement,&quot; says Rep. Edward Markey, (D., Mass.), chairman of the House telecommunications subcommittee.    The FCC also is expected to push fiercely for the further deregulation of ATandamp;T, which dominates the long-distance market. The first goal is to free ATandamp;T from filing voluminous studies when it wants to change rates. FCC Chairman Patrick, who previously was a commissioner, also has suggested ending regulation of ATandamp;T's profit margin, arguing that it discourages cost cutting. Instead, he has proposed freezing ATandamp;T's phone rates and allowing the company to keep much of the profit from cost reductions.    Further deregulation of ATandamp;T is bound to be controversial. Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America, argues that such a plan probably will let ATandamp;T raise rates along with inflation, and will strengthen the hand of government officials who want to deregulate local phone companies as well. Consumers will be stuck with higher phone rates, he fears, while big-business customers will benefit from price cuts and new services that consumers can't afford or don't want.    Regulators should be forcing phone rates down for consumers, Mr. Kimmelman argues. &quot;Regulation has gotten a bum rap,&quot; he says. &quot;It has provided cheap service and innovation.&quot;    The regulatory trend, however, is going in the other direction. Next month, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a Commerce Department agency, is expected to recommend ending traditional regulation of phone-company profit margins. And MCI Communications Inc., ATandamp;T's archrival in the long-distance telephone business, recently changed its longtime position and came out in favor of unfettering ATandamp;T. MCI's switch, says Rep. Swift, &quot;makes it harder to oppose&quot; deregulation.    Kenneth Robinson, the NTIA's policy adviser, calculates that the cost of regulation now adds $6 a year to a consumer's phone bill. &quot;You're paying a $6 insurance policy against what?&quot; he argues. &quot;If you want to protect the public against extortionate telephone rates,&quot; he says, &quot;just tell the phone companies they can't raise phone rates,&quot; while freeing them of other restraints.    &quot;Deregulation,&quot; concludes Rep. Thomas Tauke, (R., Iowa), a member of the House telecommunications subcommittee, &quot;is still moving in telecommunications; we'll see more of it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
