Most of the energy savings come from improvementof existing equipments (industrial plants, housings, etc.) where we finda large potential of energy savings under the threshold cost. In a developingcountry, most of the energy savings potential comes from the new equipmentsas growth rate of demography, industrial output, building constructionare much higher than in any industrialized country. Consequently, energymanagement is an economic necessity both in industrialized and developingcountries but government measures to implement such an energy policymust be adapted to the consumption patterns of each country.</TEXT></DOC>
