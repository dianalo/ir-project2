The price report brought smiles at the White House, where theReagan administration claimed it showed inflation was not heatingup. But some private economists expressed worries about what couldhappen if world oil prices suddenly rebound.   The September increase represented a drop from an Augustincrease of 0.6 percent. For the first nine months, wholesaleprices have been rising at a rate of 4.3 percent.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the inflationreport showed a ``clear downward trend'' indicating inflation wasunder control.   The government also reported Friday that retail sales fell forthe second straight month in September, declining 0.4 percentbecause of weakness in auto sales.   In another sign that the economy was slowing, the FederalReserve said the operating rate for America's factories, mines andutilities was unchanged in September, the first month industrialproduction has failed to increase since last February.   The financial markets took the data in stride. Stock prices rodeout alternating waves of buying and selling to finish littlechanged, with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials losing 0.18to close at 2,133.18. An initial rally in the bond market ran outof steam as the dollar fell and oil prices rose. Bonds finishedslightly higher.   In the view of many economists the sluggish reports on retailsales and industrial production were encouraging signs that theeconomy was not in danger of overheating.   Those worries earlier in the year had prompted the FederalReserve, in an inflation-fighting move, to tighten creditconditions and push interest rates higher.   ``The good news is that inflation and interest rates have peakedand should decline in coming months,'' said Richard Rahn, chiefeconomist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``The bad news is notall that bad. The economy is slowing, but only slightly.''   Other economists agreed, although some said they were worriedthat the underlying inflation rate, after removing the volatilefood and energy categories, jumped by 0.6 percent in September,double the rate of increase in August.   Some economists suggested that the central bank is likely towait until after the Nov. 8 presidential election and then resumepushing interest rates higher in a further effort to dampenconsumer demand.   The big dampening effect on prices last month came from a 3.3percent drop in energy costs, the biggest decline since January.All fuel categories showed decreases. Gasoline costs fell 3.3percent, natural gas dropped 2.5 percent and home heating oildeclined by 4.6 percent.   The price declines reflected the current battle amongoil-producing nations over production quotas.   Offsetting the drop in energy costs, food prices jumped by 1.2percent last month, three times the rate of increase in August,serving notice to consumers that the effects of the summer droughthave not played themselves out.   Many economists said they expect this pattern of higher foodcosts offset by declining energy prices to repeat itself for therest of the year.   ``Once again we lucked out,'' said David Wyss, an economist withData Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass. ``Energy prices aredropping at precisely the time we need it to balance the drought.''   Wyss noted that declining world oil prices in 1986 had helpedcushion the inflationary impact from a drop in the value of thedollar.   But John Hagens, senior economist at the WEFA Group, anothereconomic consulting firm, said the scenario for moderate inflationcould be disrupted if OPEC countries start obeying their productionquotas and world oil prices rebound.   ``The downward movement in oil prices could suddenly come backto hit us if they start rising again, pushing the inflation ratehigher,'' he said.   Much of the momentum for the September gain in food costs camefrom a 4.2 percent jump in beef prices as producers ended the herdliquidations that had depressed prices earlier in the drought cycle.   Fruit costs jumped 10 percent, and vegetable prices shot up by16.5 percent. Both gains were blamed on demand shortages caused bythe drought. Prices also rose for coffee and dairy products, whichboth climbed 1.5 percent.   Prices fell, however, for eggs, down 8.5 percent; pork, down 4.2percent; and rice, down 3.6 percent.   Another factor pushing prices higher in September was a 1.8percent increase in new automobile prices. The report said thisreflected lower end-of-the-model-year incentives to buyers asautomakers were faced with less of an overhang of unsold cars thanthey have had in past years.   The September changes put the Labor Department's Producer PriceIndex for finished goods at 108.6, meaning that a hypotheticalselection of goods costing $100 at wholesale in 1982 would havecost $108.60 last month.   The government on Oct. 21 will release its report on pricechanges at the consumer level. Through August, consumer prices wererising at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, only slightly higher thanthe 4.4 percent gain for all of 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
