The one-time hardness test is applicableto certain truss tube assemblies which have a butt-welded end fitting witha lug welded to the end fitting. A Tungsten inert gas (TIG)-welded singlepiece end fitting which has the lug as an integral part of the fittingdoes not require the hardness test. Since issuing the AD, the FAA has determined that four part numbers includedin the introductory text of paragraph (a) and one part number and locationfor the last truss listed in Table 1 were misidentified. Therefore, theFAA is amending AD 89-04-01, Amendment 39-6131, as amended by Amendment39-6279, to correctly identify these part numbers.Since this amendment is clarifying in nature only, and imposes no additionalburden on any person, notice and public procedure hereon are unnecessary,and the amendment may be made effective in less than 30 days. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is clarifying in nature andimposes no further cost. Therefore, I certify that this action (1) is nota ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291, (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 10034; February26, 1979). A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action is containedin the regulatory docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the RegionalRules Docket. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 </ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. <ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection; 39.13 of part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES</ITAG>1.
