Sales of oil products fell 7.9% from the 1990 level toabout 101.2 million barrels.

After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August lastyear, refiners boosted their runs sharply to cut expensiveoil product imports.   Crude-oil imports from Saudi Arabia and the United ArabEmirates showed sharp jumps from a year earlier. Thosecountries have been making up for the reduced importsresulting from suspension of exports from Kuwait and Iraq.   United Arab Emirates was the largest crude-oil supplier toJapan in September, but its export volume fell by 7.6% fromAugust to 1.03 million barrels a day.   Saudi Arabia, the second-largest crude exporter, shipped966,000 barrels a day in September, up 24.1% from August andup 50.2% from a year earlier.
