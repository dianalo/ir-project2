That's not to say a recession is desirable. The heavy debt burdens of U.S. companies and Third World nations, as well as the continued weakness of the banking system, raise fears that a recession now would quickly snowball into financial disaster.    Nor does a recession appear imminent. At the moment, most indicators point to an economy that is picking up, not sputtering out.    But the stubborn intransigence of the trade figures, despite Treasury Secretary James Baker's policy to devalue the dollar, suggests no other medicine may be strong enough. The monthly merchandise trade gap set new records in June and July, hitting $15.7 billion and then $16.5 billion. That rise partly reflects seasonal distortions in the statistics; but at best, the trade trend is flat.    &quot;I've been looking for improvement and haven't seen it, and I'm beginning to get discouraged,&quot; says Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Charles Kindleberger. &quot;This may mean we have to have a recession&quot; before the deficit numbers are reversed.    To be sure, Mr. Baker's dollar policy has succeeded in boosting exports. The lower dollar has made U.S. products less expensive overseas, and that's sparking a surge in shipments of chemicals, paper and assorted other products. Exports in July, for instance, were up a strong 20% from a year earlier.    The problem, however, is that imports are rising as well. Higher prices have done little to discourage Americans from buying Toyota automobiles, Samsung televisions and Gucci shoes. &quot;Americans don't stop buying French Burgundy wine just because it costs 50 cents more,&quot; says General Electric chief economist Walter Joelson. &quot;The prices of many imports have risen 10% to 15%, but we just tend to ignore that.&quot;    Moreover, U.S. imports are already so large that even when they grow more slowly than exports (imports in July were only 12% above a year earlier), the trade deficit widens.    American consumers could ease the import problem by spending less of their incomes, and saving more. But in the past, efforts to discourage spending and boost saving have proved futile. History shows that the only foolproof method for curbing U.S. consumer enthusiasm is the painful one: recession.    In Congress, the recent statistics have fueled efforts to enact tough trade legislation. But even proponents of the trade bill admit that new laws will do little to reduce the deficit. &quot;Unfair trade practices account for no more than 10% to 15% of trade deficit,&quot; says Rep. Donald Pease, a Democrat from an Ohio rust-belt district. &quot;That means the effect of this bill on the deficit will be hardly noticeable.&quot;    The Reagan administration, meanwhile, continues to lean heavily on Japan and Germany for faster growth, believing U.S. exports would grow more rapidly as a result. But Germany, in particular, continues to resist such pleas, for fear of sparking inflation. And even if Secretary Baker can persuade the tight-fisted Germans to reverse course, economists question how much that would help U.S. exports.    Treasury officials point out that the &quot;real&quot; trade deficit -- which measures the volume of imports and exports, without regard to price -- has improved substantially in the past year. That is certainly true. Commerce Department figures show that the narrowing of the &quot;real&quot; deficit is responsible for more than a third of the economy's growth since last fall.    But because import prices have risen, the dollar value of the trade deficit remains as bad as ever. And it is the dollar-denominated deficit that determines how much money the U.S. must borrow from overseas. With no trade improvement, the nation will add $150 billion to its foreign debt each year, and reach a stratospheric $1 trillion by 1993.    Many economists continue to believe improvement is just around the corner. They put their faith in the so-called &quot;J&quot; curve, which suggests that trade deficits get worse in response to a fall in the dollar, before they get better. But most economic models have been predicting the turn for months, and to no avail. As one former administration official put it, the &quot;J&quot; curve has become an &quot;L&quot;, with no upturn in sight.    Further declines in the dollar might be helpful. But the slump in the financial markets that accompanied the dollar's August drop suggests further declines may not be possible without creating new fears of inflation. And Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has already demonstrated his determination to prevent an inflation panic.    Reductions in the budget deficit could also help, by reducing the nation's overall spending level. But with an election year approaching, any deficit-cutting measures will be modest, at best.    That means the trade imbalance may well persist -- and the debt burden may continue to grow -- until, sooner or later, the economy falls into a recession. &quot;These last two months are a painful reminder of the conflict in what we are trying to do,&quot; says economist John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute. &quot;As long as the economy at home stays strong, we can't expect our trade deficit to come down.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
