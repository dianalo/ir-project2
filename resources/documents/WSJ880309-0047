John Dingell said Congress won't produce a legislative definition of insider trading, but said he is sure it will move to improve ways of detecting that crime.    Speaking to a meeting here of the Securities Industry Association, the Michigan Democrat said flatly, &quot;There will be no definition of insider trading.&quot; The Senate Banking Committee has been working on defining the crime for a year, and Rep. Dingell in the past has said he was uneasy about spelling out insider trading because any definition would contain exploitable loopholes. His expressed opposition now makes enactment of a Senate definition extremely unlikely.    But Rep. Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, did say that he and a bipartisan group of committee members are drafting legislation to beef up the way stock exchanges and other so-called self-regulatory organizations monitor transactions for possible instances of insider trading.    He told his audience that &quot;you will probably dislike&quot; some of the proposed changes. He didn't elaborate on these changes in his speech, but in an interview later, he said the bill would include additional penalties for insider trading and &quot;firmer and harsher&quot; treatment of violations of the &quot;Chinese Walls,&quot; or communications barriers that are supposed to prevent a Wall Street firm's trading operation from taking advantage of inside information possessed by its investment-banking side.    In recent months, Rep. Dingell has kept others on Capitol Hill guessing about his views on pending securities-related legislation. But over the last two days, he has spoken out about tender-offer legislation, post-crash market reforms, and the Senate Banking Committee's clearance last week of a revision of the Glass-Steagall Act, which separates commercial and investment banking.    He also said that his oversight and investigations subcommittee, along with Rep. Edward Markey's (D., Mass.) finance subcommittee, is looking into the issues of front-running and short-selling.    Rep. Dingell said he is speaking out now because, &quot;I think there's a pretty clear consensus now on what happened (during the October stock-market crash) and on what ought to be done about it.&quot;    In his speech, Rep. Dingell said the bill cleared last week by the Senate banking panel provides for inadequate &quot;firewalls&quot; to contain any financial damage from a bank's securities affiliate. He later said that while he hasn't studied the bill closely, &quot;it doesn't appear to meet any tests of responsible legislation.&quot;    Turning to tender-offer changes -- another area in which the Senate Banking Committee has voted out a bill -- Rep. Dingell said that because of state anti-takeover laws, corporate pressure on Congress to curtail hostile takeovers has &quot;all but disappeared.&quot; But he predicted that the calls for federal intervention would resume after courts begin overturning as unconstitutional at least some of those state statutes.    A Senate Banking Committee aide said that despite Rep. Dingell's opposition to an insider-trading definition, the panel will continue to try &quot;to clarify the law.&quot; He said that the effort to define insider trading is supported by the Securities and Exchange Commission, several federal officials and many members of the securities industry.    As for Rep. Dingell's criticism of the committee's action on Glass-Steagall, the aide said: &quot;It is possible that there may be some improvements made in the firewalls, but it is clear that there is overwhelming support for revision of Glass-Steagall.&quot;    Rep. Dingell, whose Energy and Commerce Committee oversees the SEC, also said that post-crash market initiatives of exchanges in New York and Chicago are good, but only a start. &quot;They're a useful stride forward,&quot; he said, &quot;but you've still got to address all the problems found&quot; by the SEC report on the crash and the presidential commission's report. </TEXT></DOC>
