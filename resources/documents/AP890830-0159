The Portland Press Herald's graphic consists of a circle with aline drawn through a bluefish, similar to the ``Ghostbusters'' logo.   Bush, whose hook has come up empty for 13 days in a row, said heplanned to call the newspaper's editor.   ``I think they should knock off that advertisement,'' he saidduring a presentation by the Chamber of Commerce for this seasideresort and neighboring Kennebunk.   Bush pointed out that someone else on his boat had caught a fish.   But Press Herald Executive Editor John K. Murphy said that wasn'tgoing to be enough to stop the graphic, which the paper plans tokeep running as long as Bush's luck stays poor.   ``I think the president's suggestion that we credit any fishcaught on his boat sounds fishy,'' Murphy said. ``We are eagerlyawaiting his first catch of his vacation.''   Bush has until Tuesday, when he plans to head back to Washington,to catch a fish.</TEXT><DATELINE>DULUTH, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The bears are back. Just ask Betty Klasnya.   ``I was sitting on my back steps, going through a bag of seedsfor planting, when I felt something was out there looking at me,''said Klasnya.   The ``something'' was a 200-pound black bear in her back yardrelishing the aroma of pork chops frying on the stove.   She ran inside, replaced the pork chops with garlic and onions toencourage the bear's departure, clapped her hands and made a fussuntil the animal sauntered back into the woods.   ``I'm not going to fry pork chops or bacon till the bear seasonis over,'' she said.   Since last week's encounter, police have received more than 20reports of bear sightings around this Lake Superior city.   The bears are in town for their late-summer gorging in greaternumbers than in the last two years.   The influx, however, doesn't come close to the invasion of 1985,when dozens of bears, searching for food here because of poor berryand nut supplies in the woods, were sighted some days.   A poor crop of hazelnuts, one of bears' favorite foods, and anincreased bear population, is forcing bears to move as far south asDuluth, experts say.   Researcher Lynn Rogers said bears that come to Duluth looking fora meal feed on clover, apples _ and garbage.</TEXT></DOC>
