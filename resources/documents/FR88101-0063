Baily, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T3>Director, Government and Industry Relations, Carrier Corporation, P.O.Box 4808, Syracuse, New York 13221 </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dear Mr. Baily: This is in response to Carrier Corporation's Applicationfor Interim Waiver, dated December 4, 1987, from the Department of Energy(DOE) test procedures for furnaces when testing its gas-fueled forced-aircondensing furnace identified as model series 58SXB (Carrier brand) andmodel series 398B (Bryant, Day and Night, and Payne brands). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Carrier submitted an Application for Interim Waiver, dated August3, 1987, for the same furnace models. The Application was denied on thebasis that the company did not provide sufficient information for the Departmentto evaluate what, if any, economic hardship Carrier will experience absenta favorable determination on the application. 52 FR 45233, Nov. 25, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In this subsequent Application for Interim Waiver, Carrier has providedadditional information which DOE believes demonstrates the economic hardshipCarrier will experience absent a favorable determination on the application.Specifically, Carrier states that since the existing procedures underratethe AFUE, Carrier is unable to market at an appropriate price the 58SXBand 398B models which currently are being produced. Consequently, Carrier'soptions are immediate inventory costs if it decides to wait for a possiblefavorable determination on the petition for waiver, or a reduced marketprice for the furnace. In either case, DOE believes Carrier will experienceeconomic hardship. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, in view of the technical merits of the Petition for Waiver,filed by Carrier, 52 FR 45233, Nov. 25, 1987, it appears likely the petitionwill be granted. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Accordingly, Carrier's Application for Interim Waiver dated December4, 1987, is granted. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Carrier is allowed to test its series 58SXB and 398B furnaces usingthe nominal temperature rise rather than the maximum temperature rise.Specifically, Carrier is allowed to test said furnaces without regard tosection 8.4.2.1.7 of Standard 103 of the American Society of Heating, Refrigeratingand Air Conditioning Engineers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This Interim Waiver shall remain in effect for 180 days from the dateof issuance or until the Department of Energy issues a determination ofCarrier's Petition for Waiver or a final test procedure amendment addressingthis issue, whichever occurs first. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This Interim Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements,allegations, and documentary materials submitted by the applicant. ThisInterim Waiver may be revoked or modified at any time upon a determinationthat the factual basis underlying the application is incorrect.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">  Yours truly, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John R.
