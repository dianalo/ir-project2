 Letter RE:  Windows and the softwareindustryandM;You may have noticed at Agenda 90 that you and your company were a favoritetarget for criticism.andP;  Indeed, at various times, Microsoft was identified asa barbarian for opposing Adobe's Postscript font format, as a monster formisleading such good citizens as Lotus and Software Publishing into focusingtheir development on OS/2, and as a general ogre for daring to be sosuccessful when the other big software companies have all had seriousproblems of one kind or another.andM;You and I know that this kind of public billybashing is way wide of the mark.andO;The facts are that you have clearly and consistently promoted Windows as thenext money-making platform; clearly said over and over again that it wouldtake years for OS/2 to gain acceptance (a situation that has not changed);and are clearly motivated by IBM's interests in their role as your primarycustomer and by your own interests as both a system software and applicationsdeveloper.andP;  So for you to be accused of all these nefarious and underhandedactions and intents is really and truly unfair.andM;Since you so quickly and complaintly followed my instructions in my last openletter (see &quot;Dear Microsoft: Please Do Your Fonts Right,&quot; Issue 5.15,9-10-89), I thought I would share my thoughts with you on how to get theindustry to be nice to Microsoft.andM;1) Get your messages straight: One of the issues that recurs constantly iswhether Microsoft can adequately manage the inherent conflict of interest inbeing both system supplier and applications developer.andP;  Over and over again,you have had to state publicly that your applications developers do not takeadvantage of unpublished capabilities in either the operating system orinterface and that your applications programmers do not get any specialtreatment from the system people.andP;  Statements are fine, but the actions ofyour company frequently do not support the statements.andP;  One recent example:At Agenda 90, the person responsible for promoting a system capability,Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), in the demonstration of inter-processcommunications, was the product manager for an application product, Excel.andO;The impression left with many people who stopped by for a demonstration wasthat you don't have any in-house capability for providing third-party supporton your system software (i.e.andP;  a DDE product manager) and that the Excelpeople probably know a lot more about DDE than other developers making aspreadsheet for Presentation Manager like Lotus, Informix, or Ashton-Tate.andO;That one little slip cost Microsoft a lot of its credibility about how itmanages to separate church and state.andM;2) Bend over backwards to help independent developers: I know that youalready have a support operation in place to help the top 40 or 50 Windowsand Presentation Manager developers.andP;  And those 40 or 50 developers know youprovide technical and marketing support.andP;  But no one else does.andP;  And one ofthe reasons they don't know is that you just don't go far enough.andM;Since you've decided that you can say the word Apple without spitting, take alook at their developer support.andP;  Apple has already learned that the only wayto make developers put up with a system software operation is to act like youcare about them a lot more than you really do (realistically speaking).andP;  SoApple has an operation called Developer Services with hundreds of employees,whose job it is to provide support for anyone who might help sell more Applecomputers, including commercial developers, corporate developers, hackers,teachers, consultants, and even press.andP;  Apple has more than 9,000 developersenrolled in the program, and does everything from selling equipment at costto major developers to writing newsletters, selling development tools,running technical conferences, doing marketing consultation, providingextended documentation and on-line support, and (of course) printing T-shirtsand making videos.andM;While the sincerity of Apple's management can always be called into question(particularly when they repeatedly try to find ways to subvert the work ofoutside developers by reproducing their products and calling it systemsoftware), the fact is that Apple's developer support is a model for theindustry.andP;  The company accepts the cost of providing better than averagesupport to developers as a fundamental cost of doing business in acompetitive environment.andP;  And that's what Microsoft needs to do go beyondwhat's necessary to provide technical and marketing support to a few bigdevelopers and create a system for helping everybody that uses Microsoftproducts as a platform for development.andP;  From your current perspective, itwill inevitably look like money that doesn't need to be spent and that wouldbe wasted if it was spent.andP;  But, if you want the industry to buy your pointof view and understand what you're trying to accomplish, you are going tohave to spend a lot more money on helping that industry and communicatingwith it.andM;3) Over--correct for IBM's mistakes: The fundamental problem thatapplications developers have today, whether they know it or not, is thedegree of incompatibility between Windows and Presentation Manager.andP;  It meansthat development work done for Presentation Manager cannot be easily portedback to Windows (although the reverse route is easier, since Windows is asubset of PM).andP;  And it means that customers have a hard time keeping the twosystems straight.andP;  There are two reasons for this situation: the first isthat IBM insisted on making OS/2 work in 80286 protected mode, instead ofgoing straight to the 386's protected and virtual modes; the second is thatIBM insisted on replacing Windows' graphics programming interface with itsown graphics device display manager interface, GDDM, when it adopted theinterface for OS/2, thereby making the graphics models for the two systemfundamentally different.andP;  (By the way, would you mind renaming the Windowsgraphics programming interface, GPI, to something like Windraw, so that I'mnot always getting it confused with GDDM or GDI, graphics device interface,as it's now called in OS/2? Apple's idea of not using acronyms for systemcomponents is really a very good idea.)andP;  Okay, so the damage is done.andO;Perhaps IBM was right that GDDM was a much more extensible and flexibleinterface than GPI (even if does need about 500K of memory all by itself).andO;And maybe IBM was right that 286 users should get a multitasking operatingsystem.andP;  But it doesn't matter any longer.andM;Now, your problem is to repair the damage and make it so that developersaren't constantly dancing over the gap between Windows and PM and so thatusers don't have to remember which mode the chip is in order to use DOS,Windows, and PM programs on the same machine.andP;  That's a big problem, one thatyou seem to be planning to resolve in the next complete release of OS/2, theone that will be written specifically for the 80386 chip.andP;  But I think youmight extract a lesson from the experience of these two mistakes that IBM hasmade: In other words, you were smart enough to know that IBM shouldn't havemade these decisions in the first place.andP;  So your job, as intermediarybetween IBM and the industry, is to over-correct for IBM even before IBMknows they've made a mistake.andP;  One of the things that you are being blamedfor currently is for promoting OS/2 as the next standard platform for majorsoftware developers like Lotus, Ashton-Tate, Software Publishing, andWordperfect.andP;  In fact, it is IBM's fault for setting expectations too highfor OS/2.andP;  The only way you can avoid getting into the same situation you'rein now is by making sure that the industry correctly interprets what IBMsays.andP;  For instance, IBM is currently on a multimedia binge, in which you areplaying a major definitional role in setting the standards for the technologythat will enable multimedia applications on a standard platform.andP;  Have youasked yourself the following question: What compromises have you made withIBM in order to gain their endorsement that will eventually come back andbite you in your relationships with other software companies?andP;  Is there anIBM-developed technology included in the standard specification that somehowdoesn't meet the standards of technology available from independent chipcompanies?andP;  If so, you need to get right out there with the softwarecompanies that have already been disclosed and show them why that technologyis included and how the compromise was worth it.andM;4) Keep a stiff upper lip: To a certain degree, there is nothing you can doto change the industry's perception of Microsoft.andP;  The fact is that Microsofthas made more right guesses than any other company in the industry.andP;  WhereLotus, Ashton-Tate, Borland, Wordperfect, Software Publishing and othercompanies bet against Windows (mostly out of pique), you clearly bet in favorof Windows.andP;  And now your bet has been clearly identified as the correct one(just as your bet on the Macintosh was also correct).andP;  Where othersystem-software companies weren't able to compromise with IBM, you werewilling to make the necessary compromises, even by sacrificing a little ofyour credibility.andP;  Your compromises on the implementation of OS/2 andPresentation Manager have not been clearly identified as the right ones.andP;  Andnow everybody is trying to paint you as an ogre because you bet correctly onyour own system software and compromised on IBM's system to get theirendorsement.andP;  But, no matter what you do in support, in public statements, inactual development, or otherwise, being successful means that you are alwaysgoing to be a special target for criticism, fair or not.andP;  That was true ofVisicorp in 1982; of Apple in 1983; of IBM in 1984; of Lotus in 1985.andP;  Thefact is that whoever is on top is going to get shellacked.andP;  It's just part ofthe price of being on top.andP;  Indeed, the only way to change that situation isto screw up royally so that no one cares what you do.andP;  I would guess that isan unacceptable alternative.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
