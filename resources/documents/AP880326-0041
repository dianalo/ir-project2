The Nevada del Ruiz volcano's activity had stabilized by Fridaynight and there appeared to be little immediate danger of a majoreruption, said Eduardo Parra, director of Colombia's VolcanoInstitute in Manizales.   ``The evacuations are for avoiding any ugly surprises,'' he saidin a communique.   Airline pilots reported seeing steam and ash rising to 28,000feet above the volcano, the Colombian Civil AeronauticsAdministration said.   About 1,900 people in the villages of Libano, Murillo andPalestina, all on the volcano's western slope, were being moved outFriday night, the government's National Emergency Committee said ina communique.   Before dark Friday, about 600 people living on farms on thesides of the volanco were evacuated, the emergency committee said.   The Volcano Institute upgraded its alert at nightfall Friday,advising people living along rivers up to 20 miles away to be readyto flee if the volcano erupts.   An estimated 50,000 people live within a 15-mile radius of thevolcano in what is considered the danger zone if there is a majoreruption.   The Andes Seismological Institute in Bogota said it wasrecording almost constant tremors, but none strong enough toregister on the Richter scale.   The river danger zones were established by a National EmergencyCommittee after the devastating Nov. 13, 1985 eruption. Theyincludes the rivers Guali, Lagunilla, Azufrado, Recio and Sabandijato the east of the volcano and the Chinchinica River to the west.   Residents of Honda, 20 miles northeast of the volcano and at theconfluence of the Guali and Magdalena Rivers, suspended theirannual fishing festival.   The dancing, parades, parties and heavy drinking mark themovement of millions of fish up rivers to spawn, a boon tofishermen.   Sight of the awesome column of steam and ash sobered up manyrevelers, the RCN radio network said.   About a quarter-inch of ash covered the town of Manizales about20 miles to the northwest of the volcano, RCN reported. Manizalesis not considered to be in danger because it is outside theflooding zones.   Friday's volcanic activity was the highest since the 1985eruption, when melting glaciers on the volcano created floodingthat left trees, boulders and other debris blocking the LagunillaRiver on the western slope.   The blockage burst, and a 10-story-high wall of mud roared downthe river canyon, burst onto a plain and wiped out the town ofArmero in seconds.</TEXT></DOC>
