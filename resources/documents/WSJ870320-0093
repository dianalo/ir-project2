JamesStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) </IN><DATELINE> CHICAGO </DATELINE><TEXT>   A series of lawsuits by former Duff andamp; Phelps Inc. employees have made the credit rating firm the subject of a local tabloid scandal.    The lawsuits were filed in federal district court in Chicago by workers who left the employee-owned firm before its shares were acquired in a buyout. The suits assert that Duff andamp; Phelps violated various securities laws in its handling of the buyout, which paid $2,000 a share. The suits ask that the departing employees, who had to sell their shares at a far lower price when they left the firm, be compensated for the difference.    The suits are in the news again because a Chicago federal appeals court this week ordered a jury trial for one of suits, which the lower court had dismissed.    The appellate court opinion by circuit Judge Frank H. Easterbrook recounts an embarrassing tale of how Duff andamp; Phelps's former controller, Carol Franchik, was able to swing a different arrangement when she left the company.    According to the court opinion, Ms. Franchik was fired after the company's board was told she was involved in an affair with Claire Hansen, Duff andamp; Phelps's chairman. When Ms. Franchik threatened a sex-discrimination suit over the firing, the board agreed to make an exception to an existing company policy that departing employees must sell their shares back to the company, said a plaintiff's attorney, James S. Gordon, who cited depositions by board members.    Ms. Franchik kept her 300 shares and later sold them for the full buyout price of $2,000 apiece, or a total of $600,000. The former employees who are suing sold their shares for less than $150 each.    Mr. Gordon, the attorney for plaintiff Paul Much, asserted in his opening argument that Ms. Franchik had access to inside information because of her alleged affair with Mr. Hansen. In testimony, Ms. Franchik acknowledged a personal relationship with her former boss. Mr. Hansen testified that he told directors he wasn't having an affair.    Mr. Hansen declined to comment on the suits. Ms. Franchik couldn't be reached.    The suits have drawn considerable attention in the Chicago business community. Ms. Franchik has appeared on the front pages of local newspapers wearing a fur coat with a turned up collar as she exited the courtroom. The publicity could build further with the appellate court's decision.    The appeals court sent the suit of James S. Jordan, a former Duff andamp; Phelps analyst, back to the lower court for trial, saying that as a shareholder in a private company Mr. Jordan should have been privy to information Ms. Franchik apparently had. The lower court had said in granting summary judgment that the employer had no duty to inform Jordan about the buyout talks. There have been no court decisions on the other employee suits.    According to the appellate court opinion, Mr. Jordan quit the Chicago-based company in November 1983 and went to Houston because of tension between his wife and his mother, who also lived in Chicago. &quot;Our position is that Mr. Jordan would've never left when he did had he been told about the negotiations and the chance that he could've made more than $600,000 instead of $23,000,&quot; said Thomas Ward, his lawyer.    When Mr. Jordan left Duff andamp; Phelps, he owned 188 shares and was making installment payments on another 62. The appeals court apparently agreed with Mr. Ward and Mr. Jordan. &quot;Difficulties with a mother-in-law are a strain, but families bear strains greater than that for the prospect of financial gain,&quot; wrote Judge Easterbrook. </TEXT></DOC>
