(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Gov. Evan Mecham's criminal trialon charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan must beginThursday as scheduled, an appellate court has ruled.   The intermediate level Court of Appeals, in a 3-0 decisionMonday, rejected a defense bid to have the charges against Mechamand his brother, Willard, dismissed or returned to the state grandjury.   ``To be honest with you, I expected it just the way it cameout,'' said Mecham, who sat in the front row during oral arguments.   His lawyer, Michael Scott, said he will appeal to the stateSupreme Court, but probably not before jury selection begins inMaricopa County Superior Court.   Evan and Willard Mecham, his 1986 campaign treasurer, wereindicted by the grand jury Jan. 8 on charges of perjury, willfulconcealment and filing false documents.   They were accused of failing to report the $350,000 loan oneither Mecham's personal or campaign finance reports as required.Mecham faces six counts and his brother faces three.   The Court of Appeals ruled that the defendants ``were not deniedany substantial procedural rights in the grand jury proceedings.''Mecham said he does not expect the state Supreme Court to reversethe decision.   ``I don't know of any possibility or probability'' of alast-minute plea agreement, Mecham said. ``I have broken no lawsthat I am aware of.''   Mecham, 64, was removed from office April 4 when the Senateconvicted him on impeachment charges of trying to thwart a deaththreat investigation and misusing $80,000 from the governor'sprotocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership.   He also was impeached on charges of concealing the $350,000campaign loan from Tempe developer Barry Wolfson, but the Senatedecided not to consider that charge for fear of prejudicingMecham's criminal trial.   The Mechams' attorneys asked the appeals court to either dismissthe charges or return them to the grand jury for a newdetermination of probable cause.   ``The 24th grand jury was well-greased and the indictment was aninevitability,'' Scott told the court. ``They were given erroneousadvice ... The prosecutor manipulated that grand jury.''   Scott contended the grand jurors were discouraged from callingwitnesses or from reading transcripts of testimony on the Mechamcase given to a previous grand jury. Also, he said it was unfair toexclude from the grand jury everyone who had signed a pro- oranti-Mecham recall petition.   Willard Mecham's attorney, Joe Keilp, accused the state attorneygeneral's office of ``taking an inexperienced grand jury andmolding them to the will of the prosecutors. ... They (jurors) werediscouraged from reading the testimony. They were discouraged inour view from calling witnesses.''   However, William Schafer III, of the attorney general's criminaldivision, contended there was no misconduct and that the grand jurywas not misled on its power to call witnesses or review testimony.   ``There was every effort made ... to ensure that this was goingto be a fair and impartial grand jury,'' Schafer said.   In announcing the court's decision, Judge Melvyn Shelley saidother claims made by the defense in an effort to void the chargesmay be addressed only as an appeal if Mecham is convicted.   Mecham has insisted that the $350,000 loan was properly reportedwhen it was lumped with other funds into a $465,000 amount listedas a contribution from himself.   The then-governor amended his financial reports on Nov. 16, toinclude the loan, saying the failure to report it earlier was an``honest mistake'' by his brother and that there was no intent tobreak the law.</TEXT></DOC>
