Within hours of the president's address, theDemocrat-controlled Senate moved on its own to appoint aspecial counsel in the Thomas case. But it broadened theinvestigation to include leaks of an Ethics Committee reportearlier this year listing allegations of improper behavior bythe so-called Keating Five -- four Democrats and oneRepublican accused of improperly intervening with federalregulators on behalf of indicted savings-and-loan figureCharles Keating.</LP><TEXT>   Democratic leaders of both houses angrily rebutted theneed for accepting the president's broad reforms, suggestinghe was using the issue to move the public's attention awayfrom what they called more important domestic issues.   The flurry of charges and countercharges came as thepresident and lawmakers grappled with institutional andpartisan disputes left over from the fight concerning Mr.Thomas's nomination, which concluded last week with a 52-48vote in favor of his confirmation.   Mr. Bush said his proposals resulted from his and thepublic's &quot;disgust&quot; over the handling of the allegations thatnearly derailed Justice Thomas's confirmation, including thepublic airing of what Mr. Bush called &quot;X-rated statements&quot;during the hearings. President Bush strongly criticizedleaking confidential statements to the public, and he calledthe specific leaks of the sexual harassment charges&quot;unforgivable.&quot;   As a result, the president said that he would no longerallow Federal Bureau of Investigation reports on nominees toremain on Capitol Hill. He said he would direct the agency togive the reports only to committee chairmen and lawmakersdesignated by the chairmen, barring committee staffers fromreading the reports. Lawmakers will be required to read thereports only in the presence of the FBI agents deliveringthem.   Mr. Bush also criticized the time it takes for Congress toact on appointments and the documentation the lawmakersrequest. But more broadly, he suggested that Congress neededa thorough overhaul of its procedures and practices, sayingthat the burgeoning bureaucracy designed to serve that bodyhas made it increasingly &quot;remote . . . distant and complex.&quot;   House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) called many of thepresident's charges &quot;absolute nonsense.&quot; He also stoutlydefended the lawmakers as &quot;hard working&quot; and &quot;close to thepeople.&quot;   Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), chairman of the SenateJudiciary Committee that conducted the Thomas hearings,argued that Mr. Bush's proposals would only slow theconfirmation process further. And he again stressed that theleaked sexual harassment charges weren't contained in an FBIreport and thus wouldn't have been covered by Mr. Bush'sproposals.   Specifically, Mr. Bush called for Congress:   -- To limit the time between nomination and confirmationto six weeks. Mr. Bush said it took the Senate an average of63 days to confirm his nominees in 1989 and 65 days in 1990,while some nominees have now been waiting 80 days.   -- To preserve the confidentiality of information.   -- To establish a mechanism to investigate congressionalleaks.   -- To extend laws governing employment and other practicesfrom which the U.S. Congress is exempt, such as the 1964Civil Rights Act barring discrimination in the workplace.   Noting that Congress exempts itself from a dozen laws thatapply to the executive branch, including some that apply tomost work places in the U.S., Mr. Bush claimed theseexemptions &quot;encourage special interest groups&quot; to push for&quot;reckless regulations&quot; because Congress won't be affected.And he said it &quot;creates the appearance and reality of aprivileged class of rulers who stand above the law.&quot;   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) saidCongress is moving to make itself subject to such laws in thepending civil-rights bill. He asserted that presidentialemployees also are exempt from some employment andanti-discrimination laws. &quot;Those who would reform othersshould first reform themselves,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
