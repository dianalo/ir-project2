The capacity involved is 2185 MW(net)and, with 4 other units of a more recent design, has provided the CEGBwith a reliable component of base load electrical production. This paperwill review the achievements of these early CEGB Nuclear stations, brieflyin terms of their setting to work phase and more fully in their middleyears of operation. It will include the current levels of performanceand the problems arising from maintenance and plant breakdown. With thisbackground the factors affecting future operation will be discussed andhow they will be incorporated into the CEGB planning process.</TEXT></DOC>
