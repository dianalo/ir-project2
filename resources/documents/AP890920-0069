City Attorney Attorney Doug Jewett, a Republican and co-sponsorof an anti-busing initiative, finished first in Tuesday's primary.City Council member Norm Rice, a Democrat and leading opponent ofthe measure, finished second. It is Rice's second bid to becomeSeattle's first black mayor.   With a voter turnout exceeding 31 percent and nearly all votescounted, Jewett had 23,299 votes or 24 percent and Rice, 20,763votes or 21.4 percent.   Former King County Executive Randy Revelle was next with 14,880votes or 15.4 percent, followed by City Council members Jim Street,14,473 or 14.9 percent, and Dolores Sibonga, who had hoped to becomeSeattle's first Asian-American mayor, 11,422 votes or 11.8 percent.   David Stern, advertising executive and creator of the ``HappyFace,'' had 5,311 votes for 5.5 percent.   Mayor Charles Royer, a liberal Democrat and former president ofthe National League of Cities, is stepping down after anunprecedented 12 years in office. He'll become head of the Instituteof Political Studies at Harvard University's Kennedy School ofGovernment.   Rice was rated the pre-election favorite because of the namefamiliarity he built in a losing 1984 mayoral race and congressionalbid last fall.   Jewett's campaign focused on his backing of Initiative 32, anattempt to end mandatory busing in the city. The measure, which isbeing challenged in court, is scheduled to appear on the city ballotNov. 7.   All the other major candidates opposed the initiative andsupported the new ``controlled choice'' program, adopted this yearto reduce the reliance on mandatory busing that has angered bothwhite and minority parents who want their children in neighborhoodschools.   Rice, 46, who said the school initiative was the main reason heran, told cheering supporters, ``This election is one of clearchoice.'' He accused Jewett and other initiative backers of beingracially divisive.   Jewett, 43, dismissed the criticism.   ``The school issue is not a racial issue,'' he said. ``It's amatter of choice and parents being able to send their children toquality neighborhood schools.''</TEXT></DOC>
