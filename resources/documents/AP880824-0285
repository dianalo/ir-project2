(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Home builder Bert Garey thinks of hiswork as art, so he's refusing to sell one of his latest creationsunless the buyer agrees to pay a 1 percent royalty.   The unprecedented proposal is sending new shudders through thealready trembling California realty market, where the median pricefor a single-family home has jumped 21.2 percent in the past yearto more than $170,000.   The home on which Garey wants a royalty is priced at $685,000.Garey is requesting the 1 percent cut for him or his heirs eachtime the house is sold.   ``Every time a realtor spends two weeks selling a house, he gets6 percent,'' said Garey. ``I don't see why the person who designedand built it shouldn't get 1 percent.''   But real estate attorney Ken Fishbach said the housing marketcould be set reeling if the royalty idea catches on.   ``This has a huge potential to snarl up real estatetransactions,'' he said. Unusual deed restrictions can make it hardfor title companies to provide clear title for properties, heexplained.   ``It's the kind of thing that only happens in California,''quipped Ralph Holmer, the Chicago-based chief counsel for theNational Association of Realtors. He said it's the first time he'sheard of an artist's royalty in real estate.   If builder royalties should become commonplace, many believe itcould only add new fuel to the blazing California realty market.   The California Association of Realtors reported Wednesday thatthe median price of an existing home rose during July to $172,347in California _ $208,110 in the San Francisco Bay area.Nevertheless, the number of home sales has risen 8.2 percent in thepast year.   Garey's homes are priced about 20 percent higher than homes ofcomparable size in the area, but the builder still considers them abargain. He says the royalty has nothing to do with money.   ``It's pure ego,'' Garey said. ``I want something that shows my17-year-old son that I was here ... something to be seen for myeffort.''   Garey has admired Berkeley's distinctive houses since he was a19-year-old history and literature student at the University ofCalifornia at Berkeley.   One day about 25 years ago he rode his motorcycle through thehills and discovered a home under construction by localdesigner-builder Judd Boynton. That night, he recalls, he dreamedabout the house and later went to Boynton and said he wanted to buyit, even though he didn't have any money.   ``I'm not going to sell it, but I'll teach you to build yourown,'' Boynton replied.   Since then, Garey has designed and handcrafted 11 homes. He sayshe has hoisted every hand-polished beam and hammered every board,usually with the help of just one assistant. He also says he hasdone the wiring, set the tile, caulked the windows and installedthe plumbing.   ``I love it,'' he said. ``It's like sculpting on a large scale.''   A brochure describes the home for which Garey wants a royalty as``timeless architecture ... not a style but an attitude ... aliving sculpture of form and feeling, light and view, redwood andmahogany.''   So far, there has been no taker for the four-bedroom house inthe Berkeley hills with a spectacular view of the Golden GateBridge.</TEXT></DOC>
