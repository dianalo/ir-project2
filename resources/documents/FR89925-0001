The Orientalfruit fly can cause serious economic losses. Heavy infestations can causecomplete loss of crops. The short life cycle of this pest permits the rapiddevelopment of serious outbreaks. A document effective on August 15, 1989, and published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on August 21, 1989 (54 FR 34477-34483, DocketNumber 89-144) established the Oriental fruit fly regulations (7 CFR 301.93<T3>et seq., </T3>referred to below as the regulations). The regulationsimpose restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles fromquarantined areas to prevent the spread of the Oriental fruit fly intononinfested areas of the United States. The regulations, among other things, designated a portion of Los AngelesCounty in California as a quarantined area. This area remains infestedwith Oriental fruit fly. However, the Oriental fruit fly has now been found in an additional areaof Los Angeles County, California, and a portion of Orange County, California,as a result of recent trapping surveys by inspectors of California Stateand county agencies and by inspectors of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, U.S. Department of Agriculture. The regulations in andSection; 301.93-3provide that the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService shall list as a quarantined area each State, or each portion ofa State, in which the Oriental fruit fly has been found by an inspector.Accordingly, we are amending the regulations by adding the following areain Los Angeles and Orange Counties in California as a quarantined area:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Los Angeles County and Orange County</T3>_That portion of Los Angelesand Orange Counties in the Cerritos area bounded by a line beginning atthe intersection of Studebaker Road and Florence Avenue, then east alongFlorence Avenue to its intersection with Telegraph Road, then southeastalong Telegraph Road to its intersection with Imperial Highway, then eastalong Imperial Highway to its intersection with Santa Gertrudes Avenue,then south along Santa Gertrudes Avenue to its intersection with RosecransAvenue, then east along Rosecrans Avenue to its intersection with GilbertStreet, then south along Gilbert Street to its intersection with KatellaAvenue, then west along Katella Avenue to the point at which it becomesWillow Street, then west along Willow Street to its intersection with BellflowerBoulevard, then north along Bellflower Boulevard to its intersection withImperial Highway, then east along Imperial Highway to its intersectionwith Studebaker Road, then north along Studebaker Road to the point ofbeginning. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Emergency Action </ITAG>James W. Glosser, Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, has determined that there is good cause for publishing this rulewithout prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessaryto prevent the Oriental fruit fly from spreading to noninfested areas ofthe United States. Since prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this interimrule are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under theseconditions, there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effectiveupon signature. We will consider comments that are received within 60 daysof publication of this interim rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. After the comment period closes, we will publishanother document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, including discussion of any comments we receiveand any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291. This interim rule restricts the interstate movement of regulated articlesfrom a portion of Los Angeles and Orange Counties in California. It appearsthat there are approximately 90 small entities in the quarantined areathat may be affected by this rule. The small entities that may be affectedinclude approximately 80 nurseries, 1 commercial grower of cucumbers andtomatoes, 1 commercial grower of Oriental persimmons, 1 community garden,5 fruit markets, 2 farmers markets, and 1 swap meet. These small entities comprise less than \1/2\ of 1 percent of the totalof small entities operating in California. In addition, these small entitiessell regulated articles primarily for local intrastate, not interstate,movement. Also, many of the nurseries sell other items in addition to theregulated articles so that the effect, if any, of this regulation on theseentities appears to be minimal.The effect on those few entities that do move regulated articles interstatewill be minimized by the availability of various treatments that, in mostcases, will allow these small entities to move regulated articles interstatewith very little additional cost. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The regulations in this subpart contain no information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372 </ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.
