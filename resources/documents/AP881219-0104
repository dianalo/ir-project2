GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SA MAT, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Infantry, armor and artillery unitsreturned home Monday in a partial Vietnamese withdrawal fromoccupied Cambodia, where insurgents are fighting a jungle waragainst the Hanoi-supported government.   Vietnam said the soldiers were leaving western Cambodia on fourland routes and by boat down the Mekong River, and claimed only50,000 troops would remain to support the client governmentestablished after its December 1978 invasion.   The Khmer Rouge rulers whose murderous regime Vietnam overthrew adecade ago have the strongest force in the three-party guerrillacoalition fighting the occupation army.   Villagers and children waving Vietnamese and Cambodian flagslined the red dirt road on which soldiers of the 5th and 309thDivisions approached and crossed the frontier Monday at Sa Mat.   Included in columns were Soviet-made trucks towing U.S.howitzers, and armored personnel carriers captured at the end of theVietnam War in 1975. At least one vehicle still carried the horseemblem of the U.S. 11th armored cavalry.   Vietnam and the client government it supports in Phnom Penh say18,000 soldiers will have left Cambodia in a week-long withdrawalscheduled to end Wednesday.   Western analysts sometimes said earlier partial withdrawals,which began in 1982, were only ``troop rotations.'' Americans andothers acknowledge, however, that Hanoi has reduced its strength inCambodia substantially from a high of 200,000 soldiers.   While vehicles moved along the dusty roads, the officialCambodian news agency SPK said a fleet of nearly 200 vesselscarrying Vietnamese soldiers sailed past Phnom Penh on their wayhome.   It said about 10,000 people, including Cambodian Communist Partyofficials and military officers, lined the banks in the earlymorning to bid farewell to the soldiers.   Division commander Col. Nguyen Minh Chau came ashore to shakehands and the fleet then sailed southward on the 70-mile journey tothe border, the agency said.   At Sa Mat, an officer commanding three vehicles, told reportershis unit had seen little action in two years against Khmer Rougeguerrillas. ``They may attack some of our small units but when theyhear armor coming they disappear,'' Nguyen Van Vinh said.   Other soldiers also said they had met few guerrillas during aprolonged lull, which has been confirmed by Western analysts andinterpreted either as the end of the guerrillas or a ``calm beforethe storm.''   Some say the Khmer Rouge, whose strength usually is given as30,000-40,000, are concentrating on organization, propaganda andstockpiling weapons as the Vietnamese proceed with a promisedpullout of all forces by 1990.   Earlier Monday, elements of the two divisions joined in afarewell ceremony at Kompong Cham, a provincial capital on theMekong about 45 miles from the border. A rock band played, thousandsof children lined the roads and commanders laid wreaths at amonument to the hundreds of thousands of people killed during theKhmer Rouge's reign of terror in 1975-79.   Children held up placards reading ``We will think of you always''as the Vietnamese column rolled through the war-scarred town towardsteel ferries that took them across the river.   Kompong Cham, once a thriving resort and center of the rubbertrade, was largely destroyed in 1973 when the Khmer Rouge nearlyseized it from the U.S.-backed government of President Lon Nol. Itbecame a ghost town during Khmer Rouge rule.   At this border post, the Vietnamese soldiers completed a five-daytrek across Cambodia from bases in Battambang, a province on theCambodian border with Thailand.   Lt. Gen. Nguyen Van Thai, a Vietnamese army spokesman, said about6,000 soldiers and 300 vehicles were involved.   About 150 foreign journalists were in Cambodia for the withdrawal.</TEXT></DOC>
