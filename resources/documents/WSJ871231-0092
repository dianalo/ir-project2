Mr. Campeau said in a statement that he intends to offer 19 dollars a share for as many as five million subordinate voting shares and to offer 855 dollars for each 1,000 dollars principal amount of 7.5% convertible subordinated debentures with a face value of as much as 130 million dollars.    The offer won't be open to residents or citizens of the U.S., Mr. Campeau said. Campeau shares closed yesterday at 17.875 dollars, up 87.5 cents, in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.    Mr. Campeau didn't explain why we planned to enlarge his stake in the company, and he wasn't available to elaborate. But analysts suspected that he believes his own recent optimistic statements about the outlook for Campeau.    Don Tigert, an analyst with Brown, Baldwin, Nisker Ltd., said he thought Mr. Campeau decided &quot;to buy back shares that he considers depressed in the market.&quot; Mr. Tigert declined to give a personal opinion of the shares' value.    The planned purchases wouldn't alter control of the company, which is firmly in Mr. Campeau's hands through his holding of all its eight million second preference shares, which carry 10 votes each. Mr. Tigert said the Campeau family also holds about 48% of the company's 44.3 million subordinate voting shares outstanding, which carry one vote each. The 184 million dollars of debentures outstanding are convertible into about 5.8 million shares.    Last month Mr. Campeau predicted that Campeau will earn more than two dollars a share in 1988, after it consolidates its late-1986 acquisition of Allied Stores Corp. for $3.4 billion. He said Allied's debt had been halved to $1.65 billion through asset sales. Campeau had a net loss of 239.2 million dollars for the first nine months of this year.    Mr. Campeau didn't distribute his press statements to U.S. news organizations, and Campeau executives didn't return telephone calls, apparently because the offer isn't open to U.S. citizens. Canadian companies often make such limited offers, to avoid costs and delays associated with U.S. securities regulations. Some of them have received legal advice against communicating with U.S. news organizations during such offers.    U.S. holders nevertheless are able to participate indirectly in the offers by selling their shares through a Canadian securities dealer. Mr. Campeau said he planned to make the offer &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
