(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal appeals court judge Wednesdaytemporarily halted IRS efforts to revoke PTL's tax-exempt status.   Judge William Williams of the 4th U.S. Circuit of Appeals inRichmond, Va., said the TV ministry built by Jim and Tammy Bakkerwould suffer irreparable harm if it were determined later that theIRS overstepped its authority.   The judge set a March 31 hearing in Greenville, S.C., where PTLattorneys are expected to argue that loss of tax-exempt statuswould be a death blow to PTL, which is trying to reorganize underbankruptcy court protection.   On Monday, U.S. District Judge Karen Henderson had ruled thatthe Internal Revenue Service could revoke PTL's tax-exempt status.She overturned a December order by a Bankruptcy Court judge, sayingthat court had no authority to stop the IRS.   As a religious organization, PTL does not have to pay tax on thedonations that finance its religious work.   PTL is trying to raise about $4 million by May 2 and emerge frombankruptcy court. If it loses its tax-exempt status now, thousandsof contributors will be frightened off, the ministry said.   The IRS wants to revoke its status retroactively to 1981 andseek at least $55.7 million in back taxes. In effect, the IRS hassuggested that Bakker wasn't running a ministry but a profitablebusiness for himself, relatives and friends.</TEXT></DOC>
