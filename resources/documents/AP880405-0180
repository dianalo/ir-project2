The FCC's warning was prompted by a recent surge in complaintsabout these new alternative operator services, known as AOScompanies, said Greg Vogt, chief of the FCC's telephone enforcementdivision.   The agency is trying to determine whether the companies areacting legally, he said, but ``it is premature to conclude whetherthere should be any action at the federal level.''   The FCC has begun an inquiry to find out about the companies'operations and the rates they charge, he said.   ``We don't want to have a knee-jerk reaction that could kill anindustry,'' he said.   The businesses are competing in a $7-billion-a-year market thatuntil recently was dominated by American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.They emerged within the past two years to fill the void left whenATandamp;T stopped paying commissions to hotels and motels on thelong-distance calls made by their guests.   AOS companies serve mainly the transient public in hotels,motels and at pay phones as well as hospitals and universities,handling credit card, collect and third-party billed calls.   Since January, the FCC has received about 260 complaints frompeople who said they were given no indication that an AOS companywas handling their call or that they would be billed at rates otherthan those of the company whose long-distance credit card they wereusing. In most cases, the AOS company has refunded the disputedamount, the FCC said.   At an establishment served by AOS company, callers who dial``0'' for an operator are routed to the AOS. An operator getsbilling information and then sends the call over a line the AOSleases from one of the long-distance carriers, like ATandamp;T or MCICommunications Corp.   Many of the callers who get connected to an AOS company arethose using a credit card issued by a local Bell phone company orATandamp;T, since use of those cards require callers to start by dialinga ``0.'' Other companies's cards require callers to dial a local or800 number to place their call.   Most of the AOS companies have billing contracts with the Bellcompanies, which means callers receive the AOS charges along withtheir monthly local Bell phone bill. Some AOS companies also acceptpayment by other major credit cards, such as MasterCard and Visa.   The FCC advises that callers ask an operator what company theywork for, what rates they will be charged and how they will bebilled before placing the call. If they are dissatisfied, theyshould find another phone, the FCC says.   Several states have begun considering regulation of AOScompanies because of complaints and some have issued consumeralerts.   AOS companies say theirs is a new and growing industry to whichconsumers haven't yet become accustomed. The major AOS companiessay their operators are trained to identify themselves to callersbefore placing their calls.   Vogt said, however, that some AOS companies can place automatedcalls, which substitute ``bong'' tones for a live operator toinstruct callers on how to proceed with a credit card. There is nofederal requirement for AOS companies to identify themselves, hesaid.   The problems AOS companies present are complex, Vogt said,adding,``we've never seen a situation quite like this addressed bythe commission.''</TEXT></DOC>
