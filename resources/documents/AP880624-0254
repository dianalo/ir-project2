Pentagon officials who asked not to be identified said Fridaythe theft of one privately owned computer and one government-ownedcomputer occurred two months ago and appeared to be ``an insidejob.''   The thefts did not compromise any classified programs, but weretroubling because of the emphasis placed on physical security bythe Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, the Pentagon unitresponsible for the Star Wars anti-missile program, the sourcesadded.   The thief or thieves entered the facility by sabotaging thesecurity system protecting the Star Wars office, local televisionstation WJLA reported Friday. Videotape cameras failed to recordthe theft because they had not been loaded _ a common occurence inthe high security office, the ABC affiliate, citing unidentifiedPentagon investigators for the information.   Maj. Bill O'Connell, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statementthat ``one privately owned stand-alone personal computer was stolenfrom offices within the SDIO's Pentagon complex in early April.''   ``Since that theft, the Defense Criminal Investigative Serviceand the FBI have been conducting an investigation. Theinvestigation to date leads us to conclude that no nationalsecurity information was compromised in any way.''   Late Friday, the spokesman released a second statement, sayingagents were investigating ``a potentially related matter(involving) the disappearance of an IBM compatible AT classpersonal computer ... from the SDIO computer training center.''   ``No classified materials of any sort are used in the trainingfacility.''   O'Connell declined to elaborate, but a source said the theftsoccurred over the weekend of April 9 and 10.   The first theft, involving a Commodore personal computer ownedby a ``mid-level manager'' in the kinetic energy program, occurredbetween Friday evening and Saturday morning. The second theftoccurred between Saturday evening and Sunday morning, the officialsaid.   Kinetic energy weapons are designed to destroy enemy missilesthrough the sheer force of impact.   According to the source, investigators believe an SDIO employeewith the proper door-security card and clearances entered thebasement complex through the main doors, where a guard was on duty,but then left with the computers through another security door thatis under television surveillance but not guarded.   The Star Wars office complex is one of the few areas of thePentagon building that is off-limits to those without a specialsecurity pass in addition to the normal building pass.</TEXT></DOC>
