Of course, some weapons continue to dribble out ofexisting Cuban and Sandinista stockpiles, as well as the oddLibyan contribution and solidarity fund-raisers in Europe andthe U.S. But an alternative source of revenue is suggested bylast week's release of kidnapping victim Gregorio Zelaya bythe Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation (FMLN).</LP><TEXT>   The FMLN denies that Mr. Zelaya was anything as mundane asa hostage held for ransom. Radio Farabundo Marti and RadioVenceremos, organs of the two strongest FMLN factions,asserted that Mr. Zelaya was not a hostage, but was arrestedfor not paying his taxes. Mr. Zelaya, the FMLN proclaimed,had been abducted five weeks earlier for refusing to pay areported $1 million &quot;tax.&quot; It is not known whether his familypaid up after &quot;political accords&quot; resulted in his release.   Octavio Duarte, of the Salvadoran Coffee Industry ResearchInstitute, said at an Aug. 10 news conference, &quot;Our membershave been threatened during the past decade with death andabduction if they did not pay these taxes to the FMLNterrorists. Now that unpayable taxes are being charged, itsthreats are being realized.&quot;   Another hostage held since July is the governing ArenaParty co-founder, Guillermo Sol Bang. President AlfredoCristiani, as well as Arena Party officials andcoffee-industry executives, blames the FMLN for Mr. Sol'sabduction -- this time not to extort ransom, but to obtainconcessions at the bargaining table. However, the FMLN deniesthat it holds &quot;Don Billy Sol,&quot; and other observers point to asector of the radical right, which has been implicated in atleast four kidnappings since March's elections.   Whoever is responsible for the disappearance of Mr. Sol,kidnapping is one issue that has held up the United Nations'speace talks. El Salvador's 19 months of intermittentdiscussions seem to have more to do with kidnapping,high-technology weapons and internal resistance in the FMLNthan the rebels' putative claims of support. (The politicalparties previously linked to the guerrillas received 12% ofthe votes but have a clear potential for more. The rebels maydominate 15% of the territory, but have lost the support of awar-weary population.)   The longstanding FMLN practice of assessing war taxes mayhave been deliberately transformed by its commanders intohigh-stakes kidnapping. The confiscatory fee placed on Mr.Zelaya's head might have been assessed to purchase expensivemissiles on the arms market. But the cost in terms ofpropaganda was high: The kidnapping produced a flood ofpublic and private criticism, unanticipated by the FMLN --including from the newly installed and already prestigiousU.N. human rights monitoring unit.   In their formative years in the late 1970s, El Salvador'sguerrillas did not hesitate to kill their hostages when theransom demanded was late in arriving. But today, the sameguerrilla leaders are going through a financial andideological crisis. They are well aware that they walk a fineline between survival and being discredited when they resortto old &quot;fund-raising&quot; tactics such as kidnapping -- thus,their redefining of this activity as &quot;tax collection.&quot; Theseredefinitions have also forced attempts at updating oldMarxist-Leninist ideologies.   Shafik Handal, anachronistically known as the pro-MoscowCommunist Party chief and one of the two FMLN strongmen,explained the FMLN's adjustment to the &quot;new world order&quot; ayear ago at a New York fund-raiser, after he was finallygranted a visa as a reward for participating in the U.N.peace talks. Mr. Handal, a Salvadoran of Palestinian descent,noted: &quot;It is true that we have been associated with andproposed a socialist model. It is not as if the events ofEast Europe have not affected us. But we are not about tocommit suicide either. And we still have roots and supportersall over the world.   &quot;In this capitalist world,&quot; he continued, &quot;you can buy alot of arms with the money our friends raise for us. In fact,it is the next stage of world conflict, the south against thenorth, where we feel most comfortable.&quot; (Comrade Handal, whowas recently spotted dining in an elegant restaurant in Rome,apparently places a high priority on maintaining his&quot;comfortable&quot; life style.)   Despite the rhetoric, FMLN leaders clearly long for thegood old days. A few hours after learning of the Soviet coupattempt, former FMLN Commander and Salvadoran legislatorMario Aguinada Carranza explained to me, &quot;It serves Gorbachevright. He had been putting the Soviet people into destitutionand selling the national sovereignty to the West.&quot;   Only weeks and months before, Messrs. Aguinada and Handalhad been singing Mikhail Gorbachev's praises for eliminatingabuses and resuscitating communism. The other main FMLNleader, Joaquin Villalobos, announced several times in Marchthat he had renounced socialism.   Prior to recent upheavals, the Soviet government had beenadvancing its commitment to peace in Central America withdiscussions at the July Bush-Gorbachev summit and in a jointstatement by Secretary of State James Baker and then-ForeignMinister Alexander Bessmertnykh. But despite theseideological and geopolitical changes, the FMLN remains ascommitted to its Marxist revolutionary project as toresisting the Salvadoran military's tyranny.   FMLN &quot;Commandante&quot; Nidia Diaz noted in anotherfund-raising speech, &quot;All issues are on the negotiatingtable: the constitution, the armed forces, the electoralsystem, the judicial system and the economic program.&quot;President Cristiani has rejected the most controversialexisting FMLN demand for a merger of the two forces in anewly created national army as &quot;a total impracticality.&quot; Thislast FMLN demand comes partly from the example of the PopularSandinista Army of Nicaragua. Its partisan soldiers give theSandinista Party a measure of partisan law enforcement, evenafter the voters opted to toss the Sandinista Party out. Thisis what former President Daniel Ortega approvingly calls&quot;governing from below.&quot;   The democratic prerogative of El Salvador's electedlegislature to decide public policy is endangered by thedemands of FMLN extortionists. Even though the legislaturenow includes 10 deputies previously associated with the FMLN-- including the eloquent Ruben Zamora as assembly vicepresident. All the deputies, including the FMLN's formerallies, are equally held hostage by the FMLN's bargainingchips of high-tech weaponry partly financed by their&quot;taxation&quot; without representation. It remains to be seenwhether these terror tactics will induce a negotiatedsettlement or prevent one.   ---   Mr. Carey is currently writing a book on elections in newdemocracies.</TEXT></DOC>
