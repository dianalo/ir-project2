(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The name of Washington's newest lotterygame may have offended some securities industry insiders, but``Wall Street'' got off to a good start Monday, state officialssaid.   ``This is official Day One, and from what we can tell so far,it's going very well,'' said Terry Massoth, telemarketingsupervisor for the Washington State Lottery.   The state began distributing ``Wall Street'' scratch ticketsMonday and some lottery outlets already have placed a second roundof orders, Massoth said.   Players scratch across rows of boxes on the $1 tickets to revealamounts under ``Buy,'' ``Sell'' and ``Profit.'' If the sell numberis higher than the buy number in the same row, the player wins theprofit.   Prizes range from $1 to $10,000. The relatively large size ofthe top prize likely accounts for the new game's popularity,Massoth said.   ``The `Wall Street' game offers advantages not found in tradingon that New York City street,'' lottery Director Evelyn Sun said ina pre-startup statement. Players ``cannot lose more than theyinvested,'' she said.   Some strategists on the real Wall Street were offended by thepitch.   ``It's only players who speculate and don't know what they'redoing who get killed or sucked in by the market,'' said Yale Hirschin New York, a prominent investment adviser who publishes the StockTrader's Almanac.   Massoth laughed when told that the name of the new game hadaroused indignation in stock-market circles.   ``They don't feel that's gambling, huh?'' he said, noting thatstock market fluctuations sometimes are attributed to suchnon-financial events as the outcome of the Super Bowl.   ``That's real science,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
