FreedmanStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> SGL MER DARTAFOOD andamp; BEVERAGE, HOUSEHOLD GOODS, SUPERMARKETS, TOBACCO (FAB)TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><TEXT>   Kenneth Peskin of Supermarkets General Corp. routinely visits the 137 Pathmark supermarkets under his command. Recently, he expressed concern that clerks weren't filling shopping bags with enough merchandise. After all, he reasoned, the bags cost three cents each.    Even in an industry known for counting its pennies, the 47-year-old Mr. Peskin stands out. But from now on, his tightfisted ways may become a matter of necessity, not choice.    Last week, to fend off an unsolicited takeover bid by Dart Group Corp., Supermarkets General agreed to be acquired by an investor group backed by Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. in a leveraged buyout valued at $1.8 billion. The group will have its work cut out for it under the plan. In about five years, it hopes to pay back almost $1 billion, or about half of the debt it would assume to take the company private.    If Dart doesn't counter with a higher bid and the proposed transaction goes through, Mr. Peskin would become chairman and chief executive officer of Woodbridge, N.J.-based Supermarkets General. He would succeed Leonard Lieberman, 58, who has decided not to participate in the proposed company.    According to Wall Street sources, Mr. Peskin has quickly stepped in to fill the power vacuum created by Mr. Lieberman's lack of interest. As chief executive of Pathmark, Supermarkets General's largest and most profitable unit, he has been seen by Merrill Lynch as the pivotal figure in the lineup. From the outset, his confidence in the feasibility of the plan has been crucial.    &quot;Right from the start, he was unequivocal about being able to make the LBO work,&quot; says a person who participated in the negotiations. &quot;He said, 'I can do it,' and everyone believed him.&quot;    Adds J. Tomilson Hill, co-director of mergers and acquisitions at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., Supermarkets General's investment banker, &quot;He is just the kind of operator who would thrive in a leveraged transaction.&quot;    By Mr. Peskin's own admission, however, the buyout would test his mettle and that of his company. Before Landover, Md.-based Dart made its initial proposal in March, Supermarkets General already had a reputation as being one of the fastest-growing and best-managed food retailers in the country. Pathmark, for example, has the highest sales per store in all of its major markets, according to Food World, an industry publication. But Mr. Peskin will have to figure how to make a good operation even better, given the amount of debt the company would assume.    &quot;When we met with financial institutions, people said, 'So much of your success has been built on being cost-conscious. How will you do more?'&quot; Mr. Peskin acknowledges. &quot;I want our people to realize that the LBO is a tough challenge.&quot;    Industry analysts suspect that meeting such a challenge would require sacrifices. &quot;They can make it work, but they will have to be less of a growth company for the time being,&quot; says Robert Raiff, an analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc. &quot;The problem is that the supermarket business is capital-intensive. If you don't spend, sooner or later the competition will hurt you,&quot; Mr. Raiff adds.    At the heart of Supermarkets General's new approach would be a more realistic attitude toward expansion, particularly at Pathmark. In the past, the nation's eighth-largest food retailer planned capital budgets and staffing requirements around opening more stores than it actually did. &quot;We had tremendous growth plans, but weren't able to reach them,&quot; Mr. Peskin says.    Mr. Peskin has built his own reputation as a planner. Employees say he is never seen without an index card filled with reminders and ideas. His approach has been widely imitated; Supermarkets General now orders index cards for employees -- in a size tailored to fit shirt pockets.    Mr. Peskin, a Harvard Business School graduate, joined the company in 1965 and the following year became an assistant to the company's three founders. In 1968, when Supermarkets General converted its Shop-Rite stores to Pathmark outlets, Mr. Peskin was a strong behind-the-scenes force. He became president and chief operating officer of the chain in 1984, and chief executive in 1986.    As was the case during his Bronx boyhood, when he worked as a grocery clerk, Mr. Peskin likes to mind the store. At his behest, most Pathmark stores now feature slip-resistant tile floors, an innovation that last year reduced Pathmark's liability insurance by about one-third. Not long ago, he required suppliers to provide Pathmark buyers with toll-free numbers. Otherwise, he said, the buyers would call collect.    Mr. Peskin is personally frugal, too. Earlier this month, James D. Dougherty, Supermarkets General's executive vice president, says he had to vouch for Mr. Peskin to get him past Merrill Lynch's security guards. That's because he had pulled up to the investment bank's offices in his stripped-down Chevy.    To some, Mr. Peskin represents a sharp contrast to the more intellectual style of his predecessor. &quot;Lieberman is the philosopher king,&quot; says the person involved in negotiating the buyout transaction. &quot;This guy (Peskin) is a warrior.&quot;    Mr. Peskin's hard-charging ways also are reflected in his eating habits. Says someone with close ties to the company, &quot;The standard joke is if you plan to spend more than five minutes at lunch, don't go with Peskin.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
