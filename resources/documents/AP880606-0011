Sulfur dioxide emissions from the burning of coal from suchstates as Ohio long have been blamed as a major cause of acid rain,which environmentalists say is destroying waters and woodlands inthe Northeast.   Gov. Richard Celeste's press secretary, Debra Phillips, said theagreement, which she termed an outline at this point, is a proposalto Congress and would be unveiled Monday. She said the next step isfor Celeste and New York Gov. Mario Cuomo to meet with congressionalleaders.   The New York Times quoted Cuomo in its Monday editions as callingthe agreement ``a reasonable and imaginative effort to resolve ourdifferences and solve the problem of acid rain.'' He said he would``push hard and will keep pushing'' to achieve a national program todeal with the issue.   Celeste considers the agreement ``a balance between preservingjobs and cleaning up the environment,'' Ms. Phillips said.   State Sen. Bob Ney, a Republican, said the agreement is a ``hardslap across the face'' of Ohio's coal miners.   Ney said Celeste has promised some form of sulfur dioxideemission reductions to fellow Democrat Cuomo, possibly in exchangefor New York's dropping of a federal lawsuit that attempts to forceemission reductions in coal-burning states.   ``I've been told that Ohio was agreeing to some reduction over aperiod of years,'' Ney said. ``For Celeste to do this, he wouldeither have to do it by executive order or ask the Ohio Legislatureto do it. He would have run into a brick wall there.''   Ohio Environmental Protection Agency Director Richard Shank wouldnot discuss details Sunday night, but he said the agreement ``enterson clean-coal technology and sulfur dioxide emissions reductions ...and also nitrogen oxide, which also is a contributor to acid rain.''   He said the lawsuit is not involved in the agreement.   Shank said Ohio and New York officials met over several months``and came up with common ground on acid rain.''   ``I wasn't too optimistic going into it, but after months of workon it, we finally came up with something,'' Shank said. ``It looksat it (acid rain) as a national problem.''   In Albany, N.Y., Cuomo's chief spokesman, Gary Fryer, said theproposal stemmed from a discussion between the two governors lastJuly at a meeting of the national Democratic Governors' Associationon Mackinac Island, Mich.   Fryer said New York and Ohio officials have been negotiating for``several months'' on the acid rain issue. Fryer said the agreementwill involve emissions blamed for acid rain not just from Ohio butfrom other states as well.   If approved by Congress, ``it'll reduce emissions everywhere,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
