(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Doug Folsom bought a gun, left a recordedmessage telling his wife to ``hang tough,'' climbed into thehammock outside his family's Duxbury home and pulled the trigger.   That was more than a month ago, on June 6.   The suicide followed two years of watching his young wife and3-year-old daughter Angela wither from acquired immune deficiencysyndrome. He lived with the fear that 4-year-old Nicolette, who sofar has managed to escape the disease, would test positive.   ``That poor man, watching his little girl and his wife just gothrough this deterioration. This forced him to kill himself,something he said he'd never do. So he was forced to leave me,''said Jennifer Folsom, her body frail from fighting the disease andstruggling to keep her family together.   She studied a framed photograph of the couple taken yearsearlier. Both are smiling, Doug's arm is tossed over her shoulders.The picture rests on a table within easy reach of Jennifer's chair,surrounded by tissues and bottles of medication.   ``I have a very strong attitude of `Try me.' His whole attitudewas `Why me?' He danced as long as he could. The wind was justtaken out of his sails. I feel bad for him. He didn't deservethat.''   AIDS has been a relentless enemy since Jennifer was diagnosed inFebruary 1988. The doctor gave her the test results in his emptyoffice after closing; he was concerned, she said, about how hisstaff would react to an AIDS patient.   ``I drove home. It was a long ride,'' Jennifer recalled. ``All Icould see was gloom and doom and death. I thought of suicide. Iwent into my room and I didn't ever want to come out.''   It seemed incredible that a blood transfusion during anemergency appendectomy in a Massachusetts hospital in 1979 _ beforeblood supplies were tested and purged of the virus _ probablycarried the AIDS virus into her body.   Angie, she said, contracted the virus during the pregnancy orlater from breast-feeding. Nicolette is tested every six months,and Jennifer prays her healthy, older daughter will remain freefrom AIDS.   ``Here I am, this white, middle-class housewife living inVermont, trying to make a living. How dare this disease come intomy home? It's AIDS. I eat and drink and sleep AIDS. But I'm notafraid of it anymore,'' Jennifer said.   Jennifer told her parents she was suffering from AIDS, but toldothers that she had cancer: ``We weren't sure how people were goingto react,'' she said.   She and Doug worried that business would fall off, that peoplewould be afraid to come to their auto-body shop. The healthinsurance bill, which runs about $560 monthly, continues to be thefirst bill paid each month, and she is left with about $10,000 inother unpaid bills.   Her nightmare had been that Nicolette would be harassed when shestarts school next year _ a fear the school nurse put to rest bytelling Jennifer, ``There will be no discrimination here.''   Jennifer lives day to day, and the past week had been a bad one.She was wrapped in a blue-and-white afghan and tired. She had lost10 pounds last month, and was worried about Angie's lesions andweight loss.   Angie, damp from a bath and refusing to be moved off hermother's lap, was struggling to breathe with a feeding tube up onenostril and a pacifier wedged stubbornly in her mouth.   Jennifer glanced distractedly out the living-room windows,overlooking a faded yellow motorboat parked in the side yard and asmall, neat vegetable garden. Wind chimes blew in a breeze along asecond-floor balcony.   ``I lie in bed and there are days I don't even want to get up.It's hard dealing with family life and self-worth, knowing that Ican't care for my own kids and my husband,'' she said, breakingdown. Then quickly regaining control, she said, ``I have such astrong gene in me that wants to go on. I hope I can hang on.   ``I went to a party this weekend at my sister's. And I wassitting there exhausted and I thought ... `I'm 29 years old. I justcan't be doing what a normal kid would be doing.' ''   She wants to tell her story, she said, so people will realizethe AIDS epidemic exists in rural areas of Vermont.   ``Vermont does have AIDS,'' she said. ``The children of thisgeneration need to be taught now because we don't know if there isgoing to be a cure.''   She wants to ``live with dignity and not have people whisperingbehind my back. I'm not ashamed of who I am. (AIDS) invaded my homewithout permission. I'm just hoping that by me going public,somebody else can be helped.''   For her own help, Jennifer relies on her family. Her parentsvisit daily to help care for the children, her brother has taken aleave of absence from his Washington job to help Jennifer wadethrough the red tape of locating financial assistance, and othersisters and brothers help out.   ``We've also gone through the anger and the hurt,'' saidJennifer's mother, June Kenney. ``It's not right to see yourdaughter so sick when she's so young. They should be going onpicnics and dancing.''   A visiting nurse stops by the home to provide the health carethat supplements Jennifer and Angie's weekly trips to theUniversity Health Center in Burlington, and two communityfund-raisers are planned to help raise money to cover the mortgageand medical bills.   Jennifer also attends a support group _ one woman, 10 homosexualmen.   Although a recent entry in her diary reads, ``Survival will comefrom humor, optimism, laughter and self-worth,'' Jennifer knowsdeath is inevitable.   ``I think about it more lately, that death is reality, this isreality. You can't wash it off in the shower. It's here and it'sreal and there's no light at the end of that tunnel. It keepsclosing in. I tell myself constantly, `You've come too far to givein now.' I just wish it would go away, and I know it's not going togo away,'' she said.   Doug Folsom knew all of this, and he could not bear it.Nicolette, who says her mother and sister have ``buggies,''understands as well; she once drew a picture of the blue sky with arope hanging down to the house, telling Jennifer it was God sendinga rope for Angie.   But Nicolette recently amended the caption.   ``It was for Daddy,'' she said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tues PMs, July 24</NOTE></DOC>
