The biotechnology concern, which recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors, also said it is establishing an $11 million reserve for uncollectible receivables. The company has said it will report a loss for the second quarter.    Company officials couldn't be reached for comment, but the receivables are believed to include a disputed $3.6 million promissory note from two Japanese distributors of Endotronics cell-replicating machines. As previously reported, federal investigators have raised questions about whether some machines supposedly sold were ever shipped overseas.    Endotronics said it is seeking buyers for health-care technologies, including rights to a hepatitis-B vaccine and research done on possible &quot;killer&quot; cells to fight cancer. The company said it won't continue to fund the cancer research. </TEXT></DOC>
