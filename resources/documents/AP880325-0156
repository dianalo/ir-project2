Other officials, however, denied that Israel was considering anattack on the Arab kingdom.   ``Israel has a tradition of not standing by quietly when thereis a real threat against it,'' said Yossi Ben-Aharon, a senior aideto Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. ``The question is if this is athreat or not. There are people to deal with it, the Cabinet, thegovernment.''   Saudi Arabia recently acquired the CSS-2 missiles, which have arange of 2,200 miles, enough to strike anywhere in the Middle East.They also are capable of carrying nuclear warheads.   Both the Chinese and the Saudis said the missiles won't be armedwith such warheads, and Saudi Arabia has said it purchased theweapons to deter attacks on its territory during the Iran-Iraq war.   But Israel radio reported Friday that Saudi Arabia issued awarning through the United States that it would use any remainingmissiles to strike at the Jewish state if Israel attempted apre-emptive strike.   Ben-Aharon said the issue should be left for U.S. officials,``who told us they are going to deal with the matter the best theycan, both in China and in Saudi Arabia.''   The Washington Post quoted U.S. intelligence sources as sayingthe Israeli air force has been conducting unusually intensivelow-lewel bombing practice. It said such runs could be preparationfor a strike on Saudi Arabia, though there was no hard evidence tosupport that interpretation.   The paper also noted that such exercises could help Israelprepare for raids on Palestinian targets in Lebanon.   Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, denied that Israel had made anythreats. ``We did take up our concern with the United States. Butwe never made any threat against Saudi Arabia,'' he said.   Earlier reports of a similar Ben-Aharon statement sparked strongwarnings from Egypt and Syria, and the U.S. State Departmentexpressed concern.   The Syrian government said Monday that ``any agression againstthe sister Saudi Arabian kingdom would obviously be an attackagainst Syria.''   Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak said he sent an urgent messageto President Reagan asking him to ``use his influence with Israeland urge it to stop threatening Arab states in such irresponsibleway.''   Egypt is the only Arab country to have peace treaty with Israel.   An Israeli official who demanded anonymity said Syria and Egyptwere ``overreacting to a report that has been denied.''   The official said Israel was going to mount a diplomaticcampaign to ``take the missiles out,'' but stressed that ``we nevermade any threat to take them out militarily.''</TEXT></DOC>
