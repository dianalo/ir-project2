(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Against a backdrop of nearly 200 policeofficers, Gov. William Donald Schaefer signed a law Monday makingMaryland the first state to ban the sale of cheap handguns known asSaturday Night Specials.   ``This is the first time a legislature has stood up and said,`These guns are wrong,''' the governor said. He said the measure isa step toward stopping ``the senseless killing on our streets.''   Looking on was White House press secretary James Brady, who waswounded by a Saturday Night Special in the 1981 assassinationattempt on President Reagan by John W. Hinckley Jr. Brady's wife,Sarah, had lobbied for the bill.   ``I'd like to see other states like dominoes fall into line,''said Brady, who has been in a wheelchair since the shooting.``Thumbs up for Maryland.''   ``I can't think of a sweeter, more wonderful day. This is indeeda great step for public safety,'' said Mrs. Brady.   In the last 20 years, Saturday Night Specials have been used tokill 250,000 people and injure 1{ million, she said.   The law makes it illegal after Jan. 1, 1990, to sell ormanufacture a Saturday Night Special in Maryland. It will not beagainst the law to own such weapons.   The measure also sets up a nine-member board appointed by thegovernor to prepare a list of handguns that may be sold. Weaponsthat are easily concealed, inaccurate, unsafe and poorly made willbe banned under the law.   The bill also allows the board to ban plastic guns that can beslipped through metal detectors.   Nearly 200 uniformed police officers from Maryland,Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia and West Virginia witnessed thesigning in an effort by the governor to demonstrate wide supportamong law enforcement agencies.   Gun owners, backed by the National Rifle Association, alreadyare collecting signatures to put the law to a vote in a referendumin November.   Jim Goss, an NRA official in Washington, said the organizationhad no comment on the bill. He referred callers to leaders of theMaryland Committee Against the Gun Ban.   Fred Griisser, a spokesman for the committe, said he doesn'thave a count on the number of signatures collected so far, but thathe is confident his organization will meet the requirement of33,044 to put the bill to a vote.   After that, ``it will be an uphill battle to explain the truenature of the law to the voters,'' he said.   Under the law, manufacturers can be fined up to $10,000 anddealers and gun owners up to $2,500 for each violation. Each time agun is made or sold constitutes a separate violation.   Mrs. Brady, who has been campaigning nationally for tougher gunlaws since her husband was shot, said the Maryland approach solvesthe difficult problem of trying to define Saturday Night Specialsby leaving the decision to a review board.   The board will consist of three citizen members, thesuperintendent of state police and one representative each of astate prosecutors association, the Maryland Association of Chiefsof Police, Marylanders Against Handgun Abuse, the National RifleAssociation and a Maryland gun manufacturer.   Other states are interested in the Maryland approach and guncontrol groups are gearing up to try to pass similar lawselsewhere, Mrs. Brady said.</TEXT></DOC>
