Sharansky was considering the offer from the JewishConfederation of the Soviet Union, a newly formed umbrella groupfor Soviet Jewish organizations, to visit Moscow in December, saidthe spokeswoman, who insisted on anonymity.   She was speaking from the Jerusalem-based Soviet Jewry ZionistForum headed by Sharansky.   Sharansky told the Maariv newspaper that he was interested invisiting Moscow to encourage Jewish emigration to Israel, but wasconcerned that publicity from his trip might benefit PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev.   ``I have no special nostalgia for the Soviet Union,'' Sharanskysaid. ``My consideration to return and visit there will be if sucha visit would help our struggle to encourage the Jewish awakening.''   ``I know that Gorbachev can benefit from a visit like that and Ihave to consider who would gain more, Soviet Jews or Gorbachev,''he said.   In the early 1970s, Sharansky was a member of the HelsinkiCommittee, a human rights watchdog group headed by Nobel Prizelaureate Andrei Sakharov.   Sharansky made contacts with foreign journalists in Moscow andgained prominence as a spokesman for organization. He alsochampioned the Soviet Jewry emigration movement.   He was denied an exit visa to join his wife, who left for Israela day after their wedding in 1974. In March 1977, he was arrestedand in 1978 convicted of espionage and sentenced to 13 years inprison.   He spent nine years in Soviet prisons and labor camps, becominga symbol of the Soviet Jewry's plight thanks to the efforts of hiswife, Avital, who tirelessly campaigned on his behalf in the West.   Sharansky was freed on Feb. 11, 1986, when he came West onBerlin's Glienicke Bridge. Included in the swap were Wolf GeorgFrohn of East Germany, Jaroslave Jaworski of Czechoslovakia andDietrich Nistroy of West Germany, who were released by the East,and Jerzy Kaczmarek of Poland, Yevgeni Semliakov of Soviet Union,Detlef Scharfenorth of East Germany and Karl F. Koecher ofCzechoslovakia and his wife, Hana, who were released by the West.   At first, Sharansky kept a low profile in Israel. But he emergedlast year to found the Soviet Jewry Zionist Forum, a lobby groupseeking to improve conditions for immigrants from the Soviet Union.   He also heads the Council of New Immigrants' Organizations,which represents 18 groups uniting immigrants from 40 countries.   Sharansky told Maariv he believed the Soviets would issue him avisa.   ``The Russians are making efforts to cut themselves off from thepast. Yuri Orlov, also an activist of the Helsinki Committee ...has recently visited the Soviet Union despite once being convictedas an enemy of the state, and faced no problems,'' Sharansky said.``This is not what may prevent my visit.''</TEXT></DOC>
