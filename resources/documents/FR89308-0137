Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from February 10, 1989 through February 24, 1989. The lastbiweekly notice was published on February 22, 1989 (54 FR 7622). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By April 7, 1989 the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respectto issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating licenseand any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and whowishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a writtenpetition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitions forleave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rulesof Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If arequest for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by theabove date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designatedby the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretaryor the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a noticeof hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Arizona Public Service Company, et al., Docket Nos. STN 50-528, STN50-529 and STN 50-530, Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (PVNGS), Unit1, 2 and 3, Maricopa County, Arizona </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>November 9, l988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldrevise the PVNGS Technical Specifications (TS), Section 3.4.5.1, ``RCSLeak Detection System'' by revising the operability requirements of themonitoring systems which comprise the RCS Leak Detection System, and theassociated Action Statements. More specifically, the proposed amendmentsto TS Section 3.4.5.1 would clarify that primary system leakage is monitoredby two independent techniques, not three. Airborne radioactivity is monitoredusing the particulate and/or gaseous monitor and the liquid volumes aremonitored using the sump level and/or flow monitoring system. Currently, the TS list three independent detection systems: containmentatmosphere particulate radioactivity monitoring system, containment sumplevel and flow monitoring system, and the containment atmosphere gaseousradioactivity monitoring system. However, the containment atmosphere particulatesystem and the gaseous system are a common system utilizing the same powersource, sample point and various other common components. The proposed Action Statement for inoperable containment atmosphere gaseousradioactivity and containment atmosphere particulate radioactivity wouldalso be revised to allow continued operation for up to 30 days providedthat gaseous and/or particulate grab samples of the containment atmosphereare obtained at least once per 12 hours and analyzed within the subsequent3 hours, and that the containment sump level and flow monitoring systemis available. In addition, the proposed Action Statement for inoperable containment sumplevel and flow monitoring system would allow continued operation for upto 30 days provided the containment atmosphere gaseous radioactivity monitoringand the containment atmosphere particulate radioactivity monitoring systemare operable. <T3>Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) Create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensees have evaluated the proposed amendment against these standardsand have provided the following discussion: <ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 1 - Involve a significant increase in the probability orconsequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated becausethe proposed change does not alter the current design or operation of thefacility. The revised operability requirements will not provide significantdegradation in the Reactor Coolant System leakage detection capability.These changes do not adversely affect the consequences of the design basisaccidents. Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 2 - Create the possibility of a new or different kind ofaccident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Since there areno changes in the way the plant is being operated, the potential for anunanalyzed accident is not created. No new failure modes are introduced.Therefore, the proposed change will not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 3 - Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in amargin of safety. The proposed changes do not have any adverse impact onthe containment integrity. Since the proposed changes do not affect theconsequences of any accident previously analyzed, there is no reductionin the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change matches two of the examples given in 51 FR 7751of amendments that do not include a significant hazards consideration.The proposed changes are enveloped by example (ii), a change that constitutesan additional limitation, restriction, or control not presently includedin the Technical Specifications, e.g., a more stringent action statement.The proposed changes require that grab samples of the containment atmospherebe obtained at least once per twelve hours and analyzed within the nextthree hours. This requirement is more restrictive than the current TechnicalSpecification which requires that grab samples of the containment atmospherebe obtained and analyzed at least once per twenty-four hours.... </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensees' no significant hazards analysis andconcurs with their conclusions. As such, the staff proposes to determinethat the requested changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Phoenix Public Library, Businessand Science Division, 12 East McDowell Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85004 <T3>Attorney for licensees: </T3>Mr. Arthur C.

Aproposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The Carolina Power andamp; Light Company (CPandamp;L) has reviewed the proposeddeletion to TS and has determined that the requested amendment does notinvolve a significant hazards consideration for the following reasons:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed change deletes a Surveillance Requirement that doesnot apply to the BSEP design. The intent of the surveillance requirement;to demonstrate power source operability, is met on a continuous basis bycontinually providing four normal offsite power sources for each unit asopposed to a single normal and a single alternate offsite power source.Deletion of this requirement has no impact on the consequences of any accidentbecause the intent of the surveillance requirement is met and verifiedcontinuously. The current Technical Specification only requires verificationon an 18 month basis. The probability of an accident is likewise unchanged,simply because current practice is more conservative than the existingsurveillance requirement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The present electrical distribution system does not physicallychange as a result of the proposed change; nor does its operation. Manualtransfer from a normal to an alternate power source is not possible atBSEP, simply because there is no differentiation between ``normal'' and``alternate'' power sources. Each of the four transmission lines on eachunit are continuously energized. Only two are required to be operable tomeet the intent of Technical Specification 3.8.1.1. These four supply lineswill continue to provide the offsite power necessary to provide sufficientcapacity and capability to automatically start and operate all requiredsafety loads. Based on this reasoning, CPandamp;L has determined that theproposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed change deletes a surveillance requirement which isnot consistent with the BSEP design basis. The surveillance requirementrequires that each of the two independent circuits be demonstrated operableat least once per 18 months by manually transferring unit power supplyfrom the normal circuit to the alternate circuit. At BSEP, there are fourindependent circuits for each unit (transmission lines) and there is nodifference between the alternate and normal power supplies. Manual transferof the power supply is not necessary because each of the four lines foreach unit is normally energized, and therefore verified operable, continuously.Thus, the intent of Technical Specification 3.8.1.1 is met, and the offsitepower sources are verified operable more frequently than the current surveillancerequires. Thus, there is no decrease in the margin of safety. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the CPandamp;L determinations and agrees that CPandamp;Lhas met the three standards involved for determination of no significanthazards consideration. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determinethat these changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>University of North Carolinaat Wilmington, William Madison Randall Library, 601 S.

Action a addresses no more thantwo drywell - suppression chamber vacuum breakers inoperable for opening,but closed, whereas action b addresses one open vacuum breaker. Actionc deals with vacuum breakers position indication inoperability whereasaction d defines unit shutdown requirements. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazard consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazard consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Aproposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The Carolina Power andamp; Light Company (CPandamp;L) has reviewed the proposedchanges and has determined that the requested amendment does not involvea significant hazards consideration for the following reasons: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed change clarifies the existing requirement of TechnicalSpecification 3.6.4.1. It does not impact plant equipment or design; itonly provides a clearer statement of the actions to be taken if TechnicalSpecification 3.6.4.1 cannot be met, thereby providing assurance that theproper actions are taken when necessary. The probability of an accidentis not increased because the requirement of Technical Specification 3.6.4.1and its actions have not changed; the actions have only been clarified.The same is true for the consequences of an accident; they have not changedbecause the requirements of Technical Specification 3.6.4.1 and its actionshave not changed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated becausethe requirements of Technical Specification 3.6.4.1 and its actions havenot changed. The proposed change requires that if Actions 3.6.4.1.a, 3.6.4.1.b,or 3.6.4.1.c cannot be met, the unit must be in hot shutdown within 12hours and in cold shutdown within the next 24 hours, just as TechnicalSpecification 3.6.4.1. and its actions currently require. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed amendment only clarifies the existing requirementof Technical Specification 3.6.4.1 and its actions. It does not changethe design or operation of plant equipment, nor does it change the intentof any requirements provided in the Technical Specificatons. Therefore,it does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the CPandamp;L determination and is in agreement withthem. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that these changesdo not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>University of North Carolinaat Wilmington, William Madison Randall Library, 601 S. College Road, Wilmington,North Carolina 28403-3297. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>R. E. Jones, General Counsel, CarolinaPower andamp; Light Company, P. O. Box 1551, Raleigh, North Carolina 27602<T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Edward A. Reeves <ITAG tagnum="84">Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Docket No. 50-247, IndianPoint Nuclear Generating Unit No. 2, Westchester County, New York </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>August 18, 1986, as modified January25, 1989. <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldmodify the licensee's August 18, 1986 application for amendment which wasnoticed on October 8, 1986 (51 FR 36087). The August 18, 1986 applicationproposed to add requirements to Technical Specification Tables 3.5-2 and4.1-1 requiring the operability and surveillance of the reactor trip breakersshunt trip attachment in accordance with the requirements of item 4.3 ofGeneric Letter 83-28. The August 18, 1986 application proposed that withone reactor trip logic train inoperable, reactor operation at power bepermitted to continue (allowable-out-of-service time) for up to 48 hours.The proposed amendment would reduce this allowable-out-of-service timeto six hours. The six hour allowable-out-of-service time is consistentwith the requirements of Generic Letter 85-09. The proposed amendment wouldalso add a restriction of eight hours for the time during which reactoroperation at power may continue with a reactor trip breaker and/or associatedlogic channel bypassed for maintenance or surveillance testing. The proposedamendment would also correct two minor typographical errors. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application ofthe standards for determining whether a significant hazards considerationexists by providing certain examples (48 FR 14870). Example (ii) of thoseinvolving no significant hazards consideration discusses a change thatconstitutes an additional limitation, restriction, or control not presentlyincluded in the Technical Specifications: for example, a more stringentsurveillance requirement. The proposed changes to Technical SpecificationTables 3.5-2 and 4.1-1 with respect to the reactor trip breakers providenew explicit Limiting Conditions for Operation and testing requirementsconsistent with the modified shunt trip design, not previously includedin Technical Specifications. The licensee provided the following analysis of the proposed changes: <ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards considerationbecause operation of Indian Point Unit No. 2 in accordance with these changeswould not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. The Technical Specification changessubmitted reflect plant modifications already implemented and reviewedpursuant to 10 CFR 50.59, and as such are expected to enhance the reliabilityof the reactor trip breakers to trip on demand. The proposed TechnicalSpecification changes are consistent with guidance contained in GenericLetter 85-09. In addition, the proposed changes constitute additional controlsnot presently included in the Technical Specifications. Therefore, thischange will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any accident previously evaluated. The proposed Technical Specificationchanges resulted from extensive review and analysis of the Salem ATWS eventand are a result of modifications made as recommended by those analyses.The proposed change would not alter the configuration of any of the plant'ssafety equipment. Therefore, it has been determined that this change willnot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromthat previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The modificationsmade to the plant increase the margin of safety and the proposed TechnicalSpecifications changes reflect additional conservative administrative controlsbased on those modifications. Therefore, it has been determined that thischange does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Based on the above consideration, and inasmuch as this proposed changeis similar to an example for which the Commission has determined no significanthazards considerations exist (i.e., a new limitation or surveillance requirement),the licensee concluded this proposed change does not constitute a significanthazards consideration. </ITAG>The staff agrees with the licensee's analysis. Therefore, based on theabove, the staff proposes that the proposed amendment will not involvea significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>White Plains Public Library,100 Martine Avenue, White Plains, New York, 10610. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Brent L. Brandenburg, Esq., 4 Irving Place,New York, New York 10003 <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Robert A. Capra, Director <ITAG tagnum="84">Duke Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-369 and 50-370, McGuire NuclearStation, Units 1 and 2, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>March 16, 1987, as supplemented April24, 1987 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment requestwould delete the requirements in the Technical Specifications (TS) forresistance testing of certain fuses whose function is to provide containmentpenetration conductor overcurrent protection, and would substitute a requirementthat a fuse inspection and maintenance program be maintained to ensurethat the proper size and type of fuse is installed, that the fuses showno signs of deterioration, and that the fuse connections are tight andclean. The list of containment penetration conductor overcurrent protectivedevices (circuit breakers and fuses) would be deleted from the TS and theassociated testing technique for these circuit breakers would be relocatedto the TS Bases. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The TS currently require that among other things, all containmentpenetration conductor overcurrent protection fuses shall periodically bedemonstrated operable by selecting and functionally testing a representativesample (10%) of each type of fuse on a rotating basis. The proposed licenseamendment application addresses the fact that resistance checking of fusesdoes not provide a meaningful assurance of the fault interrupting capabilityof the fuse, and that periodic removal of fuses for testing can compromisethe integrity of the fuse holder and contact points. In lieu of resistancetesting, the change would require a fuse inspection and maintenance programin conformance with IEEE Standard 242-1975, which calls for ``inspectionto ensure that the proper size fuse is installed, that it shows no signsof deterioration, and that the enclosure is clean and the connections aretight.'' Based on these considerations, and the fact that resistance verificationis performed by the vendor during the manufacturing process, the deletionof the requirements for resistance checking of these fuses would not involvea significant increase in the probability of fuse failure. Since the proposeddeletion of field testing by resistance would not impact fuse integrity,would not affect the method of plant operation, and would not affect equipmentimportant to safe operation, the proposed amendment would not create thepossibility of a new and different accident from any previously evaluated.Since the resistance checking of fuses only generates data that are notindicative of performance, and resistance checking would be replaced byan inspection and maintenance program, the deletion of the requirementsfor resistance checking of these fuses would not significantly reduce anymargins of safety. TS Tables 3.1-1a for Unit 1 and 3.1-1b for Unit 2 presently list the containmentpenetration conductor overcurrent protective devices (circuit breakersand fuses), their trip setpoints or continuous ratings, and their responsetimes. The license amendment application addresses the fact that the deletionof this list from the TS shall in no way degrade compliance with the operabilityof the containment penetration conductor overcurrent protective devicessince it is proposed that the list of these devices, including their tripsetpoints or continuous ratings and their response times, would be maintainedin an appropriately controlled (QA Condition 1) document entitled ``ElectricalControls System Description - Electrical Penetration Circuits,'' whichwould be referenced in the associated TS Bases 3/4.8.4. Test proceduresfor fuses and breakers used at the plant would reference this system descriptiondocument. The Commission has determined that removal of these circuit breakersand fuses from the TS is consistent with its TS Improvement Program. Maintainingthe list in the system description document instead of in the TS will allowthe licensee to have the flexibility in the future to change the list asneeded without first obtaining a TS change. Examples of such changes arethe addition or deletion of circuits (and breakers) or the changing ofa circuit to require a larger or smaller breaker, as a result of a designchange in the plant. The licensee states that its reviews regarding anymodification to containment penetration circuits, including additions ordeletions thereof, will be in accordance with 10 CFR 50.59, and will assurecompleteness and accuracy of the tables. The Commission has provided guidance(51 FR 7744) concerning examples of amendments that are not likely to involvea significant hazards consideration. This part of the amendment requestmatches the example of a purely administrative change to the technicalspecifications. The list of containment electrical penetration protectivedevices will be administratively maintained in the licensee-controlleddocument rather than in the TS, and this will in no way degrade the operabilityor surveillance requirements of these devices. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that the proposed changesinvolve no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Atkins Library, Universityof North Carolina, Charlotte (UNCC Station), North Carolina 28223 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Mr. Albert Carr, Duke Power Company, 422South Church Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28242 <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>David B. Matthews <ITAG tagnum="84">Duquesne Light Company, Docket No. 50-412, Beaver Valley Power Station,Unit No. 2, Shippingport, Pennsylvania </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>January 30, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldrevise three license conditions to extend the completion dates for threeissues from the first to the second refueling outage. These issues concernthe plant safety monitoring system (PSMS), detailed control room designreview (DCRDR) and safety parameter display system (SPDS). With regard to the change to the PSMS license condition, the licensee hasnot yet received any document evaluating its verification and validationplan. NRC approval may come too late for the licensee to effect changes.Therefore, the change is submitted for such an eventuality. Concerning the change to the DCRDR license condition, the licensee statedthat this program identified a large number of human engineering deficiencies(HEDs). Despite past and current efforts, a few HEDs are unlikely to beall resolved before startup from the first refueling outage. The majority,however, have been resolved. Finally, regarding the change to the SPDS license condition, the licenseestated that the majority of issues will be resolved/completed on schedule.However, some faults identified through site acceptance and final responsetime testing would not be completed in time. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists in accordance with 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposedamendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significanthazard consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with theproposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidentpreviously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. The proposed amendment would relax the implementation schedules for thePSMS, DCRDR and SPDS. The extensions themselves do not create additionalchanges in plant design or hardware, or operating procedures of the plant.These programs and their associated hardware cannot adversely affect safetyequipment or cause accidents. Even though their full implementation isexpected to help reduce the consequences and probabilities of accidents,their incomplete implementation does not increase consequences and probabilitiesof accidents. Hence the answers to questions (1) and (2) are negative.Finally, these programs and associated hardware were not factored intoany analysis, and hence their delayed implementation does not reduce anymargin of safety.

However,the associated LCO action statement requires that when core flow is lessthan the required minimum and thermal power is within the restricted zonethat either the thermal power must be reduced to the unrestricted zoneor core flow must be increased above the required minimum. These two statementsare in clear conflict. Based on an analysis of the intent of this sectionof the technical specifications, the amendment proposes to revise the surveillancerequirement to require verification of the minimum core flow when thermalpower is within the restricted rather than the unrestricted zone. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The staff has evaluated this proposed amendment and determined thatit involves no significant hazards considerations.

Muller <ITAG tagnum="84">Philadelphia Electric Company, Docket No. 50-352, Limerick GeneratingStation, Unit 1, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>November 4, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The application requests changesto the Technical Specifications (TSs) to permit operation of the reactorwith one of two reactor recirculation loops in service under certain specifiedconditions. Section 3.4.1.1 of the TSs currently has an ``ACTION'' requirementwhich states: ``With one reactor coolant system recirculation loop notin operation, immediately initiate action to reduce THERMAL POWER...withintwo hours and initiate measures to place the unit in at least HOT SHUTDOWNwithin 12 hours....'' The proposed changes would allow reactor operationwith only one recirculation loop, at reduced power and for significantperiods of time, without the need to remove the reactor from service. Single Loop Operation (SLO) is the operation of a reactor with only onerecirculation loop in service. The use of SLO provides a great deal ofoperational flexibility and serves as a mechanism to avoid the unnecessaryremoval of a reactor from service with the attendant cycling of reactorcomponents in the event a recirculation pump or other component malfunctionrenders one recirculation loop inoperable. During SLO, the core pressuredrop is reduced and the total discharge flow from the active bank of jetpumps increases at rated drive flow. Flow through the inactive jet pumpsreverses direction and the flow pattern in the reactor lower plenum becomesasymmetric relative to rated conditions with balanced two-loop inlet flow.SLO is a recognized practice for boiling water reactors that has been previouslyaccepted and licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission at various facilitiesincluding Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Hope Creek Generating Station,Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, Browns Ferry Nuclear Station, DuaneArnold, et al. The NRC has determined that SLO of BWR's is genericallyacceptable as set forth in Generic Letter No. 86-09, ``Technical Resolutionof Generic Issue No. B-59-(N-1) loop operation in BWRs and PWRs,'' datedMarch 31, 1986. The design basis accidents and abnormal operational transients associatedwith power operation, as presented in the Limerick Final Safety AnalysisReport (FSAR), Sections 6.2 and 6.3, and the main text of Chapter 15.0have been reviewed for unit operation with only one recirculation loopin service. The transient safety analysis was performed on an initial cyclebasis consistent with that for the FSAR. The analysis shows that the transientconsequences for SLO are bounded by the full power two loop operation analysisresults given in the FSAR. The conclusion drawn from the transient analysisresults is applicable to reload cycle operation as well as initial cycleoperation for the Limerick Generating Station (LGS). Operating with one recirculation loop results in a maximum power outputapproximately 30% below that which is attainable for two-loop operation.Therefore, the consequences of abnormal operational transients from one-loopoperation will be considerably less severe than those analyzed for two-loopoperation. For pressurization, flow increase, flow decrease, and cold waterinjection transients, the results presented in Chapter 15 of the LGS FSARfor two-loop operation bound both the thermal and overpressure consequencesof SLO. The Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) analysis presented in LGS FSAR Section15.6 has been evaluated for SLO. The evaluation utilized the GE methodologyoutlined in NEDO-20566-2, Revision 1, ``General Electric Company AnalyticalModel for Loss-of-Coolant Analysis in Accordance with 10 CFR 50 AppendixK Amendment No. 2 - One Recirculation Loop Out-of-Service,'' dated July1978. The licensee also presented the results of certain other analyses, theconsequences of which are bounded by previously submitted full power twoloop operation analyses. These include MCPR operating limit, containmentanalysis, ATWS and fuel mechanical performance. Consequently, no changesto the Technical Specifications addressing these areas are proposed basedon the results of these analyses. As noted previously, the licensee has proposed certain operating restrictionsthat would go into effect if the plant were to enter SLO. The proposedchanges to the TSs are listed below: The proposed changes on Page 2-1 raise the Safety Limit Minimum CriticalPower Ratio (MCPR) by 0.01 to account for increased uncertainties in thecore total flow and Traversing Incore Probe (TIP) readings during SLO.The proposed changes on Pages 2-4, 3/4 2-7, 3/4 3-60, and 3/4 3-60a provideindividual Average Power Range Monitor (APRM) scram and rod block equationsand Rod Block Monitor (RBM) rod block equations for two loop operationand SLO to account for the discrepancy between actual core flow and indicatedflow in the active loop during SLO. The proposed change on Page 3/4 2-1 incorporates a Maximum Average PlanarLinear Heat Generation Rate (MAPLHGR) reduction factor of 0.89 for SLO.The MAPLHGR reduction factor accounts for core flow decreasing more rapidlyduring a LOCA in SLO than two-loop operation which could result in moresevere heatup of fuel cladding. The proposed changes on Pages 3/4 4-1 through 3/4 4-2 incorporate actionstatements and associated surveillance requirements to ensure SLO is conductedwithin the analyzed bases. In addition to the previously mentioned MCPR,MAPLHGR, APRM and RBM changes, this specification restricts SLO to manualflow control, limits thermal power to less than or equal to 70% of rated,limits operating recirculation pump speed to less than or equal to 90%of rated, and establishes thermal hydraulic stability and differentialtemperature requirements. The proposed changes to Figure 3.4.1.1-1 Thermal Power Versus Core Flowon Page 3/4 4-3 define the unrestricted and restricted operating regionsof the percentage rated core thermal power versus percentage rated coreflow curves. The proposed changes on Pages 3/4 4-4 and 3/4 4-4a establish jet pump operabilitySurveillance Requirements for SLO. In addition, changes are proposed on Page 3/4 2-7 to delete an ambiguousphrase in the note; on Pages 3/4 2-10 and 3/4 2-10a to provide notes toclarify the applicability of MCPR operating limits; on Page 3/4 4-5 toclarify the recirculation loop flow mismatch Action requirements; and onPages B2-1, B3/4 1-2, B 3/4 2-1, B 3/4 2-2, B 3/4 2-4 and B 3/4 4-1 toincorporate the results of SLO analyses in the Bases. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license involves no significant hazards consideration ifoperation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment wouldnot: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee addressed the above three criteria, both generally and foreach TS change, in the amendment application and made a no significanthazards consideration determination. The licensee's analysis of the proposedamendment is reproduced below: <ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed Technical Specification changes for SLO will not increasethe probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. Thedesign basis accidents and abnormal operational transients associated withpower operation, as presented in the LGS FSAR, Sections 6.2 and 6.3, andChapter 15.0 have been reviewed for unit operation with only one recirculationloop in service. The appropriate setpoints and operating limits are adjustedfor SLO and are bounded by the LGS FSAR analysis performed for two-loopoperation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed Technical Specification changes will not create the possibilityof a new or different accident from any previously evaluated. Althoughthe proposed changes introduce a new mode of operation, the possible accidentsduring SLO are the same as those analyzed in the FSAR for two-loop operationand are within the bounds of the LGS FSAR analysis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed Technical Specification changes will not involve a significantreduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes adjust the appropriatesetpoints and operating limits for SLO to maintain or improve the currentmargin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A no significant hazards consideration determination for each proposedchange follows: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. MCPR Safety and Operating Limit for SLO </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The proposed increase in the MCPR fuel cladding integrity safetylimit during SLO does not increase the probability or consequences of anyaccident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The MCPR fuel cladding integrity safety limit is set such that nofuel damage is calculated to occur if the limit is not violated. It isdetermined using the NRC approved General Electric Thermal Analysis Basis(GETAB), which is a statistical model that combines uncertainties in themethods used to calculate critical power. For SLO, the uncertainties intotal core flow and TIP readings used in the determination of the safetylimit MCPR are larger than for two-loop operation. The total core flowand TIP reading uncertainties for SLO have been analyzed. The net effectof these two revised uncertainties is a 0.01 incremental increase in therequired MCPR fuel cladding integrity safety limit to a higher safety limitMCPR of 1.08 for SLO. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The current MCPR operating limit and flow-dependent MCPR limit provideadequate protection for transients initiated during SLO. The results ofthe analyses of these events show sufficient margin to the proposed increasedMCPR fuel cladding integrity safety limit. The consequences of abnormaloperational transients during single loop operation will be less severethan those analyzed for two-loop operation due to reduced maximum poweroutput. For pressurization, flow increase, flow decrease, and cold waterinjection transients, the results presented in Chapter 15 of the LGS FSARbound both the thermal and overpressure consequences of SLO. The two mostlimiting pressurization transients analyzed for SLO are Feedwater ControllerFailure - Maximum Demand (FWCF) and Generator Load Rejection with BypassFailure (LRBPF). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The FWCF event is postulated on the basis of a single failure of amaster feedwater control device, specifically one which can directly causean increase in coolant inventory by increasing the total feedwater flow.The most severe applicable event is a feedwater controller failure duringmaximum flow demand. The calculated transient MCPR of 1.20 for SLO is muchgreater than the current safety limit of 1.07 and the proposed limit of1.08. The resulting peak vessel pressure of 1113 psig is much less thanthe ASME limit of 1375 psig. The LRBPF event which is the loss of generatorelectrical load from high power conditions with failure of the main turbinebypass valves is discussed in FSAR Section 15.2.2. The calculated transientMCPR of 1.18 for SLO is much greater than the current safety limit 1.07and the proposed limit of 1.08. The resulting peak vessel pressure of 1182psig is much less than the ASME limit of 1375 psig. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The safety limit MCPR for SLO is set such that no fuel damage is calculatedto occur and thereby accomplishes the same purpose as the two-loop operationlimit. Because the revised higher safety limit of 1.08 maintains the currentmargin of safety and the current operating limit maintains sufficient marginto the revised safety limit, the change to the MCPR safety limit duringSLO does not increase the probability or consequences of any accident previouslyevaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The proposed increase in the MCPR fuel cladding integrity safetylimit during SLO does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The MCPR safety limit cannot initiate an accident and imposing theMCPR limit does not involve a change in the current mode of operation;therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident than previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The proposed increase in the MCPR fuel cladding integrity safetylimit during SLO does not involve a significant reduction in a margin ofsafety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The MCPR safety limit is determined using NRC approved methodology.The proposed 0.01 increase accounts for the increased uncertainties intotal core flow and TIP readings due to SLO. This increase in the MCPRsafety limit maintains the margin of safety established for two-loop operation.Therefore, this change does not involve a significant reduction in themargin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. Correction of RBM and APRM Flow-Biased Setpoint Equations </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The proposed changes to the RBM and APRM flow-biased setpointequations do not increase the probability or consequences of any accidentpreviously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">SLO results in backflow through 10 of the 20 jet pumps such that thedirect active-loop flow measurement may not indicate actual flow aboveabout 40% core flow without correction. The proposed changes to the RBMand APRM flow-biased setpoint equations conservatively modify the recirculationflow rate dependent rod block and scram setpoint equations to correct forone pump operation. The proposed changes adjust the setpoint equationsto preserve the original relationship between the setpoints and the effectivedrive flow when operating in SLO such that the consequences of a rod withdrawalerror during SLO are bounded by the analysis presented in FSAR Section15.4.2. Further, lower power during SLO assures that the MCPR operatinglimit is not violated. Therefore, the changes to the RBM and APRM flow-biasedsetpoint equations do not increase the probability or consequences of anaccident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The proposed changes to the RBM and APRM flow-biased setpointequations do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes correct the RBM and APRM flow-biased setpointequations to preserve the original relationship between the setpoints andthe actual effective drive flow when operating in SLO and therefore donot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident thanpreviously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The proposed changes to the RBM and APRM flow-biased setpointequations do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed corrections to the RBM and APRM flow-biased setpointequations preserve the original relationship between rod blocks and scramand actual effective drive flow during SLO; therefore, it follows thatthese changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. MAPLHGR Reduction Factor </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Application of the proposed MAPLHGR reduction factor during SLOdoes not increase the probability or consequences of any accident previouslyevaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">MAPLHGR Limits are established to ensure that the acceptance criteriafor fuel and Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) established in 10 CFR50.46 are met. For SLO, in the event of a LOCA, the core flow decreasesmore rapidly than in the two-loop operating case, resulting in more severecladding heatup. SLO would also result in small changes in the high-powernode uncovery times and times of rated spray. The effect of the refloodingtimes for various break sizes is also generally small. A SLO LOCA analysiswas performed for LGS using the models and assumptions documented in GeneralElectric Document NEDO-20566-2 Revision 1, previously referenced. Usingthis method, SAFE/REFLOOD computer code runs were made for a full spectrumof large break sizes for only the recirculation suction line breaks (mostlimiting for LGS). The total hot node uncovered time for two-loop operationis 133.8 seconds for the 100% DBA suction break. For SLO the uncoveredtime is 134.3 seconds for the 100% DBA suction break. A small break LOCAwould cause a slight increase approximately 50 degrees F) in the PCT. Thisincrease would be offset by the reduced MAPLHGR used during SLO, resultingin PCT values for small breaks less than the 1550 degree F small breakPCT value previously reported for LGS, and significantly less than the10 CFR 50.46 cladding temperature limit of 2200 degrees F. Since the refloodminus uncovery time for the SLO analysis is similar to the two-loop analysis,the MAPLGHR curves can be modified by derived reduction factors for useduring SLO. The results of an analysis performed to determine the MAPLHGRreduction factor for Cycle 2 fuel is set forth in General Electric CompanyDocument No. 23A5801, ``Supplemental Reload Licensing Submittal for LimerickGenerating Station Unit 1, Reload 1,'' dated February, 1987. The proposedMAPLHGR reduction factor is applied to ensure the consequences of a LOCAare not increased in SLO. Therefore, this change does not increase theprobability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed (LOCA).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Application of the proposed MAPLHGR reduction factor during SLOdoes not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">MAPLHGR limits are established to ensure fuel integrity in the eventof an accident. Modification of the MAPLHGR limit during SLO does not createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident than previouslyevaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Application of the proposed MAPLHGR reduction factor during SLOdoes not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The acceptance criteria of 10 CFR 50.46 establish the margins of safetyfor fuel and ECCS. The analysis calculated the total hot node uncoveredtime for the most limiting 100% DBA suction break to be 133.8 seconds fortwo loop operation and 134.3 seconds for single loop operation. The calculatedsmall break peak cladding temperature (PCT) for SLO would be less thanthe 1550 degrees F small break PCT reported for the two loop analysis.Since application of the conservatively calculated MAPLHGR reduction factoracts only to preserve the original relationship between two-loop MAPLHGRsand the acceptance criteria, this change does not involve a significantreduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">D. Thermal Power Limitation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Restricting operation in SLO to less than or equal to 70% ratedthermal power does not increase the probability or consequences of anyaccident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The analyses performed for SLO assume 75% rated thermal power and60% rated core flow, which represents single recirculation loop operationat 100% pump speed on the 105% rod line. All abnormal operational transientsanalyzed in the FSAR have been examined for effects caused by SLO. Thelimiting abnormal operational transients have been reevaluated in detail:generator load rejection with bypass failure and feedwater controller failureto maximum demand. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The impact of SLO on containment response, ATWS, and fuel thermaland mechanical performance was also evaluated. Consequences of all thesewere found to be bounded by previously submitted full power analyses. Therefore,restricting operation in SLO to less than or equal to 70% rated thermalpower does not increase the probability or consequences of an accidentpreviously analyzed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Restricting operation in SLO to less than or equal to 70% ratedthermal power does not create the possibility of a new or different kindof accident from any accident previously evaluated. The range of power/flowconditions in the SLO operating domain has been evaluated and found tobe within the previously evaluated range of operating conditions. SLO onlychanges the assumptions utilized in the appropriate previous analyses andtherefore, does not create the possibility of a new or different kind ofaccident than previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Restricting operation in SLO to less than or equal to 70% ratedthermal power does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Results of the aforementioned analyses show that SLO at 75% ratedthermal power is bounded by previously submitted full power analyses. Therefore,limiting SLO to less than or equal to 70% rated thermal power (which correspondsto 90% rated pump speed) does not involve a significant reduction in themargin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">E.

Butler <ITAG tagnum="84">Philadelphia Electric Company, Docket No. 50-352, Limerick GeneratingStation, Unit 1, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>January 27, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The request would change theTechnical Specifications (TSs) to revise the effluent dose limits to aper site rather than a per unit bases. The Limerick Generating Stationis a two-unit site. At present, only Unit 1 has an operating license. Unit2 is expected to be ready for operation within the next four months. Thestation has several liquid and gaseous waste processing systems that arecommon to both units. The liquid waste collection tanks and processingequipment serve both units. The arrangement precludes quantification ofliquid waste sources from each unit. The station has four gaseous effluentrelease points, two of which are common to both units. The North StackExhaust Duct is the release point for the offgas systems (each unit), themechanical vacuum pump and gland seal condenser exhaust system (each unit),the containment purge system (common for both units), the standby gas treatmentsystem (common for both units), and the Turbine Enclosure ventilation systems(each unit) and other common and separated systems. There is one ``hot'' maintenance shop for both units. Ventilation exhaustis released from a separate exhaust duct. There is a Unit 1 South StackExhaust Duct and a Unit 2 South Stack Exhaust Duct. The Unit 1 duct isthe release point for the Unit 1 refuel floor ventilation exhaust and theUnit 1 Reactor Enclosure ventilation exhaust. Likewise, the Unit 2 ductis the release point for the Unit 2 refuel floor ventilation exhaust andthe Unit 2 Reactor Enclosure ventilation exhaust. As is true for most BWRs,the refuel floor is one long open area above the reactors. This arrangementprecludes quantification of the gaseous waste sources to a particular unit.The activity released through all these gaseous effluent release pointsis monitored in accordance with the Technical Specifications and releasedunder controlled conditions to ensure that the airborne concentrationsmeet the dose limiting objectives and requirements specified in 10 CFRPart 50, Appendix I and requirements specified in 10 CFR 20.106 and 10CFR 50.34a. The offsite dose consequences from gaseous effluent releasesare calculated in accordance with the equations and methodologies describedin the Limerick Generating Station Offsite Dose Calculation Manual (ODCM).The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications would revise the effluentoffsite dose limits to reflect a per site rather than a per unit limit.The current dose limits have been established as criteria for reportingthe offsite dose consequences for operation at ``each reactor unit'' tothe NRC. The current Technical Specifications are based on the assumptionthat a multi-unit site, like the Limerick Generating Station, (LGS) candistinguish as to which unit specific radioactive effluent releases originate.There are no provisions, however, to distinguish the offsite dose attributablefrom a unit specific radioactive release origin at the Limerick GeneratingStation because of the common systems and common release points. In accordance with NRC guidance provided in NUREG-0133, ``Preparation ofRadiological Effluent Technical Specifications for Nuclear Power Plants,''the LGS offsite dose assessment may be derived by estimating the contributionfrom each unit and allocating the doses accordingly. However, the sophisticationof the Limerick offsite dose assessment system allows for a more realisticand conservative evaluation of the offsite dose consequences of the radioactiveeffluent releases without having to ``estimate'' the contribution fromeach unit. Doses are assigned (calculated for each hour) to receptors duringa release based upon hourly meteorological data and corresponding hourlyaverage effluent release rates. By accumulating the doses to each receptorover the entire year, and summing these for all of the release points forthe entire site, the maximum potential offsite exposure is assured. Attemptingto separate the releases and reporting the offsite dose consequences ona per-unit basis could potentially underestimate the dose to the maximumexposed individual. This underestimation could occur when each units' maximumexposed individuals are in different sectors than the maximum exposed individualresulting from the site's total releases. The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications do not change themagnitude of the offsite dose limits allowed for a two-unit site. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license involves no significant hazards consideration ifoperation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment wouldnot: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. In the letter of January 27, 1989, PECo addressed each of these standardsand concluded that the proposed amendment does not constitute a significanthazards consideration based on the following: <ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The proposed changes to revise the effluent offsite dose limitsto a per site rather than a per unit limit do not involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The changes only revise the normal operating dose limits to reflecta two unit site. These limits are established to reflect a criteria forreporting offsite dose consequences to the NRC. The offsite consequencesof routine operation are based on the projected radioactive material releasedfrom an operating two unit site as described in Sections 11.2 and 11.4of the Final Safety Analysis Report. The proposed changes will not affectany plant hardware, plant design, plant system operation or procedure,and therefore do not modify or add any initiating parameters that wouldsignificantly increase the probability or consequences of any previouslyanalyzed accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The proposed changes to revise the effluent offsite dose limitsto a per site rather than a per unit limit do not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The design bases of LGS will remain the same. Therefore, the currentstation Final Safety Analysis Report will remain complete and accuratein its discussion of the licensing basis events and in analyzing plantresponse and consequences.

As discussed in Item (1) above, the proposed changes do notaffect any equipment nor do they involve any potential initiating eventsthat would create any new or different kind of accident.

As discussed in Item (1) above,the proposed changes do not affect any equipment, involved in potentialinitiating events, nor increase the consequences of an event. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's submittal and significant hazardsanalysis and concurs with the licensee's determination as to whether theproposed amendment involves a significant hazards consideration.

Butler <ITAG tagnum="84">Philadelphia Electric Company, Docket No. 50-352, Limerick GeneratingStation, Unit 1, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>January 27, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>This submittal requests changesto the Technical Specifications (TSs) to reflect the completion and tie-inof the Unit 2 Standby Gas Treatment System (SGTS) and the Unit 2 RefuelingArea Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. The proposedchanges reflect the original two-unit design as described in the FinalSafety Analysis Report which was previously reviewed and approved by theNuclear Regulatory Commission in NUREG-0991, ``Safety Evaluation Reportrelated to the operation of the Limerick Generating Station, Unit 1 andUnit 2'' dated August 1983 and supplements thereto. These changes are beingrequested to allow the inclusion of Unit 2 equipment that will be reliedupon or required to be operable to support the operation of Unit 1 whenUnit 2 is issued an Operating License. The SGTS is a redundant safety-related system that is designed to reducethe radioactive halogen and particulate concentrations in (1) gases thatmay be present in the secondary containment after a Loss-of-Coolant Accident(LOCA), and (2) gases present after a postulated Fuel Handling Accidentin the refueling floor area before the gases are discharged to the environment.The SGTS is a common system that serves both the Unit 1 and Unit 2 ReactorEnclosure and the Common Refueling Area. The SGTS is designed to drawdownand maintain a negative pressure in these areas during a secondary containmentisolation. The SGTS also functions to reduce halogen and particulate concentrationspurged from the primary containment through the drywell or suppressionpool purge exhaust lines. A detailed description of the SGTS is providedin Section 6.5.1.1 of the Final Safety Analysis Report. The SGTS is presently operable for the Unit 1 Reactor Enclosure, and canbe made available for the refueling area if needed while construction isbeing completed on Unit 2. The SGTS is designed as a shared system forfiltration and treatment of both the Unit 1 and Unit 2 Reactor Enclosureatmospheres and the refueling area. When the tie-in of the Unit 2 ReactorEnclosure to the SGTS is complete, that portion of the Unit 2 ductworkwill form a part of the secondary containment isolation boundary for theUnit 1 Reactor Enclosure. Included in this ductwork are the Unit 2 drywellpurge exhaust valves (HV-57-214 and HV-57-215), the suppression pool purgeexhaust valves (HV-57-204 and HV-57-212), and the slide gate dampers whichare normally open but can be used to isolate the drywell and suppressionpool purge exhaust lines in the event that the exhaust valves are inoperable.The Unit 2 Refueling Area HVAC system, as well as the existing Unit 1 RefuelingArea HVAC system, have exhaust duct radiation monitors which provide inputto the Refueling Area Secondary Containment Isolation System. The Unit1 Refueling Area HVAC system exhaust duct radiation monitors, the isolationactivation instrumentation, and the isolation valves are required to beoperable when irradiated fuel is being handled in the refueling area secondarycontainment, during core alterations, and during operations with the potentialfor draining the reactor vessel when the vessel head is off. An isolationsignal from either unit's exhaust duct radiation monitors will cause boththe Unit 1 and Unit 2 Refueling Area HVAC systems to isolate. The Unit2 radiation monitors located in the Refuel Area HVAC exhaust duct are notpresently connected to the Unit 1 isolation logic. Completion of the tie-inwould require the Unit 2 HVAC isolation activation instrumentation, isolationvalves, and the exhaust duct radiation monitors to be operable for theappropriate Operational conditions. The proposed changes to the TSs add various Unit 2 SGTS and Refueling AreaHVAC equipment operability requirements and reflect the completion andtie-in of Unit 2. Specifically, the proposed changes are the following.(a) Technical Specification Table 3.3.2-1, Table 3.3.2-2, Table 3.3.2-3,and 4.3.2.1-1 would be revised to include the ``Refueling Area Unit 2 VentilationExhaust Duct Radiation - High'' radiation monitors. The Limiting Conditionsfor Operation, setpoints, and Surveillance Requirements for these monitorsare the same as that for the existing Unit 1 radiation monitors containedin the Unit 1 Technical Specifications. Since the Refuel Area is commonto both units, operation of either Unit 1 or 2 Refuel Area VentilationSystem during OPCON * represents a potential exhaust pathway and the associatedradiation monitors should be Operable. Therefore, Tables 3.3.2-1 and 4.3.2.1-1will be revised to show the applicable Operational Condition as * whichis defined as when: (1) in Operational Condition * and, (2) during operationof the associated ventilation exhaust system. Finally to reflect completionof Unit 2 construction, Technical Specification Table 3.6.5.2.2-1 Footnote** is being deleted for the Refueling Area Ventilation Supply Valves (HV-76-217and HV-76-218) and the Drywell Purge Exhaust inboard and outboard valves(HV-57-214 and HV-57-215), and the suppression Purge Exhaust inboard andoutboard valves (HV-57-204 and HV-57-212) to eliminate the provision notto have these valves operable during Unit 2 construction. (b) Technical Specification Table 3.6.5.2.1-1 (also listed in Table 3.6.5.2.2-1)would be revised to include the Unit 2 drywell purge exhaust valves (HV-57-214and HV-57-215) and suppression purge exhaust valves (HV-57-204 and HV-57-212).These valves are required to be operable in order to maintain the Unit1 Reactor Enclosure secondary containment isolation boundary. Any breechof this isolation boundary to an area outside of the Unit 1 Reactor Enclosureaffects the ability of the SGTS to perform its design functions. Therefore,these valves are added to the list of Reactor Enclosure Secondary ContainmentVentilation System Automatic Isolation Valves, Table 3.6.5.2.1-1. In addition,since these drywell and suppression pool purge exhaust valves also providea primary containment function, their dual function, as Reactor Enclosureisolation valves for the other unit will be reflected in Table Notation33 to Table 3.6.3-1. (c) Technical Specification 3.6.5.2.1, Action C, is being revised to includea reference to slide gate dampers. The slide gate dampers are normallyopen and are located in the Unit 2 ductwork. These slide gate dampers canbe used to isolate the drywell and/or suppression pool exhaust lines inthe event that the exhaust valves are not operable. The inclusion of theslide gate dampers into Specification 3.6.5.2.1 provides manual isolationcapability in these lines. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c).

TheTS change is administrative in nature and is designed to clarify the RETSprovisions by reducing the need for interpretations, but not change theirintent. The proposed RETS portion of the amendment would: (1) modify Note (b) toTable 2.2-1 by changing the analysis required if the monitors do not meetoperability requirements from a gross radioactivity (beta or gamma) toa principal gamma emitter analysis since gamma emitters are analyzed usinggamma spectroscopy which is more reliable and accurate; (2) add Iodine-133to Table 3.2-1 for the type of activity analysis included in the radioactivegaseous waste sampling and analysis program for consistency with the programfor determining the gaseous dose rates of Section 3.2 and the Offsite DoseCalculation Manual (ODCM); (3) reformat and combine some Table 3.2-1 notesfor clarity and consistency; (4) change the noble gas sample location designatedin Surveillance 3.5.a. from the Steam Jet Air Ejector discharge (only)to either the Steam Jet Air Ejector discharge or the offgas recombinerdischarge (prior to delay of the offgas) in order to obtain a more representativesample of gross radioactivity release rate during offgas recombiner operation;(5) add new LCOs and corresponding surveillance requirements to Specification3.6 to address charcoal bed bypass capability (rather than bypass of theoffgas treatment system) and required actions per the ODCM since it isthe charcoal beds which specifically treat the offgas; (6) modify LCO specification3.7.b.2 and 3.7.b.3 concerning isolation of the offgas system dealing withthe offgas recombiner inlet and outlet temperature sensor instrumentationlimits for clarity; (7) modify Surveillance Requirement 3.7.c so that itmore closely reflects its corresponding LCO by specifying the recombinereffluent rather than the recombiner for the sample location; (8) modifyTable 3.10-1 to show that Footnote (a) only applies to the first six tripfunctions listed in the table and to show that the requirement for operabilityin Footnote (a) is concerned with one operable or tripped instrument channelper system; (9) delete Note (i) from the calibration column of Table 3.10-2since the test only applies to instrument channel functional testing.

Indian Point Unit 3 is currentlyoperating in Cycle 6 with a transition fueled core containing Westinghouse15x15 low-parasitic (LOPAR) assemblies and 15x15 Optimized Fuel Assemblies(OFAs). For subsequent cycles, it is planned to refuel and operate IndianPoint Unit 3 with the Westinghouse 15x15 Vantage 5 improved fuel design.As a result, future core loadings would range from approximately a 60%-65%OFA and 35%-40% Vantage 5 transition core (Cycle 7) to eventually an allVantage 5 fueled core. The 15x15 Vantage 5 fuel assembly is designed asa modification to the current 15x15 LOPAR and the optimized fuel assembly(OFA) designs (Reference 1). Except for the 15x15 fuel array, no IntermediateFlow Mixer (IFM) grids and the use of a Debris Filter Bottom Nozzle (DFBN),the Indian Point Unit 3 15x15 Vantage 5 fuel assembly has the same designfeatures as the standard 17x17 fuel assembly.

The WSTS recommend a shutdown margin of 5% delta k/k for therefueling condition. Westinghouse has reanalyzed the inadvertant borondilution transient (chemical and volume control malfunction) using 5% deltak/k shutdown margin. This reanalysis shows that the minimum boron concentrationof the refueling water is typically 1900 ppm for a shutdown margin of 5%delta k/k. The boron concentration must be reduced from 1900 ppm to approximately1300 ppm before the reactor will go critical. This would require significantlymore than 30 minutes. Since information on the status of the reactor coolantmakeup is continuously available to the operator, this is ample time forthe operator to initiate corrective actions. An additional conservatismexists in that the greater of the two boron concentrations, either 1900ppm or that required for a 5% delta k/k margin, is to be used during refuelingactivities. Therefore, the proposed change in the shutdown margin doesnot involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG>Based on the above analysis, the staff proposes to conclude that thesechanges do not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>White Plains Public Library,100 Martine Avenue, White Plains, New York 10601. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Mr. Charles M.

Changes are also proposed that eliminate the requirementto issue a report when an action statement is entered as a result of inservicetesting. Changes are also proposed that will make the Salem Unit 1 emergencycore cooling technical specifications consistent with the Salem Unit 2emergency core cooling technical specifications. Specifically, this amendment request proposes to modify the Technical Specificationsas follows: 1. Technical Specification 3.5.2 This section is being modified to explicitly identify the flow paths intothe Reactor Coolant System (RCS) which are required to be Operable in Modes1, 2 and 3. Also, an Action Statement that allows both ECCS subsystems to be inoperablefor up to one hour for surveillance testing is being added. Shutdown mustcommence if this time limit is exceeded. 2. Technical Specification 4.5.2 The first change adds a requirement to verify the RH19 valves open onceper 12 hours. The second change adds the requirement to verify that theSalem 1 ECCS piping is full of water by venting once every 31 days. Thisrequirement already appears in the corresponding Salem Unit 2 SurveillanceRequirement. The third change clarifies that with the CS14 valve inoperablethe affected system is the Containment Spray System (Spray Additive Tank)and directs the operator to Technical Specification 3.6.2.2. 3. Technical Specification 3.5.3 This section is being modified to explicitly identify the required Operableflow paths into the RCS for each ECCS subsystem in Mode 4. The second part is for clarification only. This change makes it explicitlyclear that one safety injection (SI) or one centrifugal charging pump shallbe Operable when the RCS temperature is less than or equal to 312anddegrees;F. Third, the following note that appears in the Salem Unit 2 Technical Specifications;``Note: This particular restriction also applies in Modes 5 and 6'' isbeing added to the Unit 1 Technical Specifications to achieve consistencybetween the two documents. 4. Technical Specification Bases Section 3/4.5.2 and 3/4.5.3 The first part serves to reiterate the requirement to maintain the capabilityto supply all four RCS cold legs with each ECCS subsystem. The second partreflects the phrase being added to the pound symbol footnote of TechnicalSpecification 3.5.3 addressing the operability requirements for the safetyinjection and charging pumps in Modes 4, 5 and 6. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 1. The licensee has analyzed the proposed changes to Technical Specification3.5.2 to determine if a significant hazard exists: <ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes to Technical Specification 3.5.2 do not involvea significant hazards consideration because operation of Salem Unit 1 and2 in accordance with these changes would not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. The first change is being made forclarification only. Its purpose is to clearly reflect ECCS-LOCA designbases requirements in the Technical Specifications. No physical changeto plant systems is involved, nor is there an impact on the licensing basesof the units. Therefore, this change cannot increase the probability orconsequences of an accident. The second change allows IST stroke testingof valves listed in Surveillance 4.5.2 to continue without submittal ofan LER. The IST stroke testing intervals remain unchanged, as do the ActionStatement time limits. Therefore this second change cannot increase theprobability or consequences of an accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any previously analyzed. The first change only serves to emphasizeECCS-LOCA requirements for injection flow paths into the RCS. These requirementsare not new as they are already part of the design and licensing basesof the Salem units. The second change makes no changes to the Action Statementtime limits associated with IST surveillances conducted on valves listedin Technical Specification Surveillance 4.5.2. It only serves to addressreporting requirements. Therefore, these changes do not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The firstchange serves to maintain the current margin of safety associated withthe LOCA accident analysis and ensure that the ECCS subsystems are alignedas assumed in the design bases for the ECCS-LOCA. The second change maintainsthe Action Statement time limitations associated with IST stroke testing.Therefore, these changes make no reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's significant hazards considerationanalysis for changes to Technical Specification 3.5.2 and concurs withthe licensee's determination that the proposed changes do not involve asignificant hazards consideration. 2. With respect to the proposed changes to Technical Specification 4.5.2and 3.5.3, the Commission has provided guidance concerning the applicationof its standards set forth in 10 CFR 50.92 by providing certain examples(51 FR 7751). One of the examples, (i), of an amendment likely to involveno significant hazards consideration relates to ``A purely administrativechange to technical specifications: for example, a change to achieve consistencythroughout the technical specifications, correction of an error or a changein nomenclature.'' Another example, (ii), of an amendment likely to involve no significanthazards consideration relates to ``A change that constitutes an additionallimitation, restriction, or control not presently included in the technicalspecifications, e.g., a more stringent surveillance requirement.'' The proposed changes to Technical Specifications 4.5.2 and 3.5.3 relateto one of these examples: a. Technical Specification 4.5.2 The RH19 valves must be open in order for the residual heat removal (RHR)pumps to be capable of injecting into each RCS cold leg. This helps ensurethat the design bases for the ECCS-LOCA (Loss of Coolant Accident) is maintained.The addition of the RH19 valves to the Surveillance Requirements is a meansof additional control on the plant and represents a more stringent surveillancerequirement. Therefore, this meets example ii. The requirement to verify that the Salem 1 ECCS piping is full of wateris an example of a more stringent surveillance requirement. This meetsexample ii. In addition, the requirement to verify that the ECCS pipingis full already appears in the Salem 2 Technical Specifications. This changewill achieve consistency between units. This meets example i. The directing of operators to Technical Specification 3.6.2.2 for appropriateaction if the CS14 valve is inoperable clarifies the action requirements.By addition of the reference to Technical Specification 3.6.2.2, the ActionStatement for an inoperable Spray Additive Tank will be followed if valveCS14 becomes inoperable. CS14 is part of the Containment Spray System.Because it is a clarification, it is deemed an administrative change asillustrated in example i. b. Technical Specification 3.5.3 This change will clearly reflect the design bases flow paths for the ECCS-LOCAin the Technical Specifications. This change does not modify the ECCS injectionor recirculation flow paths in any way. The identification of the requiredflow path for the operable ECCS subsystem represents a means of controlnot currently in the technical specifications. This meets example ii. The addition of the footnote to clearly specify that only one safety injectionpump or one centrifugal charging pump need be operable in Mode 4, 5 and6 is a restriction not currently in the technical specifications. Thismeets example ii. The addition to the note in the Salem 1 Technical Specificationsof the applicability to Modes 5 and 6 is also more restrictive, an illustrationof example ii, and already appears in the Salem 2 Technical Specifications,an illustration of example i. Based on the above, the staff proposes to determine that the changes toTechnical Specification 4.5.2 and 3.5.3 do not involve significant hazardsconsiderations because they provide additional controls or are more restrictivethan the current technical specifications or involve administrative changes.3.

The hydrogen recombiners are part of the post accident combustible gascontrol system. During a postulated loss of coolant accident, hydrogengas would evolve from the reaction of water with fuel cladding, radiolyticdecomposition of water, and corrosion of metals inside containment. Thefunction of the combustible gas control system is to maintain the postaccident concentration of hydrogen gas in the containment atmosphere belowthe explosive gas limit and thereby prevent a hydrogen gas explosion fromchallenging containment integrity. To verify operability of the hydrogen recombiners, TS 3/4.6.2.a requiresthat a functional test be performed at least once per six months. In addition,TS 4.6.4.2.b requires each hydrogen combiner system to be demonstratedoperable at least once per 18 months by performance of the following surveillancerequirements: (1) TS 4.6.4.2.b.1 requires a channel calibration of allhydrogen recombiner instrumentation and control circuits. This test verifieselectrical resistance and calibrates thermocouples to plus or minus onepercent. (2) Technical Specification 4.6.4.2.b.2 and 3 require that (a)there is no evidence of abnormal conditions within the recombiners by performinga visual examination, and (b) the integrity of the heater electrical circuitsis satisfactory by performing a continuity and resistance to ground test.The proposed change would increase the interval for performance of TS 4.6.4.2.bsurveillance tests from at least once per 18 months to at least once perrefueling. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided the followingno significant hazards consideration determination: <ITAG tagnum="21">Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed changeinvolve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of anaccident previously evaluated? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Response: No. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The function of the hydrogen recombiners is to maintain the post accidentconcentration of hydrogen gas in the containment atmosphere below the explosivegas limit [and] thereby prevent a hydrogen gas explosion from challengingcontainment integrity.

The changes affect the limiting conditionfor operation (LCO) 3.4.8, Specific Activity, for radioiodine in the reactorcoolant system. The proposed changes would (1) delete the Action a forModes 1, 2 and 3, eliminating the reporting requirement for the numberof hours above the allowable dose equivalent Iodine 131 (I-131) limit;(2) delete the part of the Action a for Modes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 that involvesthe special report requirement for I-131 and proposed an additional requirementin TS Section 6.9, Annual Reports, to include an annual report to NRC regardinginstances when the I-131 specific activity limit was exceeded; and (3)within the Bases sections for TS 3/4.4.8, delete the discussion of theSpecific Activity shutdown requirement for operation in excess of 800 hoursabove the dose limit in a 12-month period. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>TVA provided the following information on the proposed TS changesin its submittal: <ITAG tagnum="21">TVA is requesting this change to reduce unnecessary reporting requirementsand eliminate an unnecessary shutdown requirement. The proposed changesare made in response to NRC Generic Letter (GL) 85-19. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The primary coolant-specific activity is sampled for radioiodine inaccordance with SQN technical specification table 4.4-4. Technical specification3.4.8 contains specific actions to be taken in response to high specific[I-131] activities. These requirements ensure plant operation within theassumptions of previous accident analyses. In addition, waste samplingfor radioiodine is performed in accordance with technical specificationtables 4.11-1 and 4.11-2. Radioiodine effluent monitoring instrumentationrequirements are specified in technical specification tables 3.3-12 and3.3-13 for liquid and gaseous effluent release paths. These sampling andmonitoring programs ensure that radioactive effluent releases are maintainedwithin regulatory limits. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NRC issued GL 85-19 to recommend that licensees delete unnecessaryreporting and plant shutdown requirements. The recommendation was basedon the NRC review of nuclear fuel quality and performance and an assessmentof the usefulness of the standard technical specification reporting andplant shutdown requirements. TVA's fuel performance at SQN is consistentwith the industry experience. Therefore, the recommendations of GL 85-19are applicable to SQN. </ITAG>The Commission has provided Standards for determining whether a significanthazards determination exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). 10 CFR 50.91requires that at the time a licensee requests an amendment, it must provideto the Commission its analyses, using the standards in Section 50.92, onthe issue of no significant hazards consideration. Therefore, in accordancewith 10 CFR 50.91 and 10 CFR 50.92, the licensee has performed and providedthe following analysis: <ITAG tagnum="21">TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification change andhas determined that it does not represent a significant hazards considerationbased on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of SQN in accordancewith the proposed amendment will not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change to the unnecessaryreporting requirements regarding radioiodine 131 levels in the primarycoolant system is strictly administrative and involves no change to planthardware or its configuration. The shutdown requirement deleted by thischange has been evaluated by the NRC in GL 85-19 as being unnecessary andserving in no way to increase plant safety. TVA fuel performance at SQNis consistent with industry experience. The remaining requirements of technicalspecification 3.4.8 ensure that the probability or consequences of accidentspreviously evaluated remain unchanged. Therefore, deletion of the unnecessaryadministrative requirements changes neither the probability of occurrencenor the consequences of a previously evaluated accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any previously analyzed. The administrative change to delete certainunnecessary reporting and plant shutdown requirements does not affect planthardware or its configuration. Therefore, deletion of the unnecessary administrativerequirements creates no new or different type of accident. The remainingrequirements of technical specification 3.4.8 ensure plant operation withinthe bounds of previous accident analyses. The requirements of technicalspecifications 3.3.3.9, 3.3.3.10, 3.11.1.1, and 3.11.2.1 ensure that radioactiveeffluent releases are maintained within regulatory limits. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed modifications address the operability andredundancy requirements of the cross-connect feature of the Auxiliary Feedwater(AFW) System. The proposal is the result of the identification of an apparentdiscrepancy between the analyses presented in the Updated Final SafetyAnalysis Report (UFSAR) and the requirements of the TS. This discrepancywas found to result in the potential for inadequate AFW flow via the Unit-to-UnitCross-Connect for certain high energy line break events. Surry Units 1 and 2 AFW systems can be cross-connected. Thus, in the eventof a failure of all of one Unit's AFW pumps, core cooling can be providedby the other Unit's AFW pumps via the cross-connect. The current TS requirethat in order to operate a Unit, only one of the other Unit's AFW pumpsneed be operable. The proposed change would increase the number of requiredavailable pumps to two. This would provide an additional margin of safetyfor common mode failure events. Allowance is made for the outage time necessaryto conduct maintenance on the AFW pumps. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided criteria for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee addressed the above three criteria in the amendment applicationand made a proposed no significant hazards consideration determination.In regard to the first criterion, the licensee provided the following analysis:<ITAG tagnum="21">The effect of the changes will be to increase the reliability of theauxiliary feedwater cross-connect feature, which is relied on for mitigationof certain high energy line breaks outside containment and fires [sic].The current UFSAR accident analysis results and conclusions are not affectedby the proposed changes. </ITAG>With respect to the second criterion, the licensee stated: <ITAG tagnum="21">The redundancy requirements for the auxiliary feedwater system haveno impact on the range of initiating events previously assessed. </ITAG>In regard to the third criterion, the licensee provided the following statement:<ITAG tagnum="21">Since the results of the existing UFSAR accident analyses remain bounding,the safety margins are not impacted. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the analysis provided by the licensee in supportof a proposed no significant hazards consideration determination. The staffagrees with the licensee's analysis and believes that the licensee hasmet the criteria for such a determination. In addition, the Commissionhas provided guidance concerning the application of the criteria for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists by providing certainexamples (51 FR 7751). One of the examples of actions involving no significanthazards considerations is example (ii), a change that constitutes an additionalrestriction not presently included in the TS; e.g., a more stringent surveillancerequirement. The proposed changes fall within the scope of this example.Therefore, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed changes donot involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Swem Library, College ofWilliam and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia 23185. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Michael W.

The Commission has determined foreach of these amendments that the application for the amendment complieswith the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, asamended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commissionhas made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission'srules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the licenseamendment. Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the datethe amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish,for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Considerationof Issuance of Amendment and Proposed No Significant Hazards ConsiderationDetermination and Opportunity for a Hearing. For exigent circumstances,the Commission has either issued a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice providing opportunity for public commentor has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surroundinga licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission'sproposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commissionhas provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, usingits best efforts to make available to the public means of communicationfor the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments,the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licenseehas been informed of the public comments. In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted,for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in preventionof either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up tothe plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunityto provide for public comment on its no significant hazards determination.In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunityfor comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment.If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, theState has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediatelyeffective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearingfrom any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any requiredhearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards considerationis involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made afinal determination that the amendment involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documentsrelated to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued andmade effective as indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendmentssatisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impactstatement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments.If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the specialcircumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determinationbased on that assessment, it is so indicated. For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applicationfor amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3)the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or EnvironmentalAssessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room for the particularfacility involved. A copy of items (2) and (3) may be obtained upon request addressed to theU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Director,Division of Reactor Projects. The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respectto the issuance of the amendments. By April 7, 1989, the licensee may filea request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to thesubject facility operating license and any person whose interest may beaffected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party inthe proceeding must file a written petition for leave to intervene. Requestsfor a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordancewith the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings''in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to interveneis filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safetyand Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition andthe Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board willissue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceedingand how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested,it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held wouldtake place while the amendment is in effect. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date.
