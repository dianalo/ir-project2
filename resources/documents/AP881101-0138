He wins popularity polls but often isbooed and heckled when he takes to the campaign trail.   Peres, 65, head of the left-leaning Labor Party, is anintellectual, a writer whose honed speeches impress Israel'smiddle-class, many of whom share his European background.   But his literary allusions and plays on words are sometimes seenas pretentious or even dishonest by Sephardis, the working classJews of North African and Middle Eastern origin who make up most ofIsrael's voters.   Aides cringed at a recent rally in a working class area whenPeres referred to the artist Marc Chagall to argue against a plan bythe rival Likud bloc that would give Palestinians autonomy withoutsovereignty.   ``They say autonomy for people but not territory, as if peopleare suspended in air like in a Chagall painting,'' he said.   In the campaign for parliamentary elections, Peres has been thetarget of stoning and heckling in towns populated by Sephardis,backers of the right-wing Likud headed by Prime Minister YitzhakShamir.   Peres has consistently outscored Shamir in personal popularitypolls. But voter surveys showed Labor and Likud extremely close onelection day.   The Labor leader based his campaign on trying to draw Jordan intoa dialogue within an international peace conference, to negotiatepeace in exchange for giving up parts of the occupied West Bank andGaza Strip.   But he faces audiences worried about security and about thePalestinian uprising. Detractors also say Peres' backing for theinternational conference, which he once opposed, shows he shiftspolicies to suit his needs.   Peres is trying to regain the position he reached in 1985 when asprime minister in a coalition government he ended Israel'sthree-year occupation of Lebanon and curbed triple-digit inflation.   He turned the prime minister's job over to Shamir in 1986 under apower-sharing agreement worked out when neither Labor nor Likudgained enough votes in the 1984 election to form a government.   Peres began serving Israel as an agent buying arms for thecountry's fight for independence in the 1940s. He gained statureamong Israelis when, as defense minister in 1976, he was anarchitect of the raid to rescue Israeli hostages from Entebbe.   Born in Vishneva, Poland, Peres immigrated with his family toPalestine when he was 10. He Hebraicized his name from Persky,joined a Zionist youth movement and tasted life on a kibbutz, orcommunal farm. He married Sonya Gelman in 1945.   He began his political career as a motorcycle messenger forIsrael's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion. Later, asBen-Gurion's deputy defense minister, Peres was the founder ofIsrael's arms and aircraft industries.   From Ben-Gurion, Peres learned the art of political compromiseand pragmatism, which are his trademarks along with hard work. Heoften works from dawn to midnight at what one aide called a``murderous pace.''   Peres' practical approach is illustrated by his support for anArab-backed plan for an international conference to resolve theMiddle East conflict. He opposed the plan when he was primeminister, fearing a wide forum of nations would try to impose asettlement on Israel.   But he changed his mind when he concluded that Jordan would cometo the peace table only under the umbrella of an internationalconference.   The turnabout has been widely mocked by Peres' rivals, but hisallies defend it as an example of flexibility that could lead Israelto a peace treaty with an Arab neighbor.   Peres has written four books and studied for a time at HarvardUniversity in the United States. He once said that as a youth hethought of becoming a poet.   ``Poets are truly wise men for they see the end and are afraid,''he said. ``Politicians see a series of happenings. For if apolitician could see how things end, he would stop struggling andquit the arena.''</TEXT></DOC>
