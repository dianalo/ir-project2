Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.,said at a news conference Wednesday with more than a dozen of thebill's 35 House and Senate co-sponsors. ``We have mobilized a fewassets; we have a lot more to do.''   The cost of the Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 would beoffset by an estimated $3.2 billion in debt collection mandated bythe bill, DeConcini said in introducing the legislation.   The bill would add staff to the Internal Revenue Service and theBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to collect an additional$1.25 billion in taxes owed the government, and direct otherfederal agencies to collect $2 billion in non-tax debt owed toUncle Sam. The money would be placed in a new Anti-Drug AbuseTreasury Fund to help pay for the bill, DeConcini said.   The 199-page bill calls for resurrecting the state and localnarcotics control grant program by providing $1.5 billion overthree years, including $250 million next year.   Additionally, the bill moves the Coast Guard from the Departmentof Transportation to the Treasury Department to provide bettercoordination with the U.S. Customs Service, and creates astreamlined deportation process for aliens who have been convictedof a drug-related or violent crime.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Group Says EPA Report Will Show Many Eastern Streams Too Acidic</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A major environmental group says an unreleasedreport of the Environmental Protection Agency shows that up to 14percent of streams in sampled areas of eastern mountains are tooacidic.

Richard Ayres, a council staff lawyer who chairs the Clean AirCoalition of environmental groups, said: ``We tried to give them abreak. We have had this document for over a year and have beenurging them to release the final report. They stiffed us at everyturn.''   As part of its research on the effects of acid rain, the EPAextensively sampled lakes and streams in 1985 and 1986. Lakeresults have been reported extensively.   But the EPA criticized the use of preliminary data by the group.Spokesman Chris Rice said many tables would show ``significantchanges'' when the document is ready for release, probably in May.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Ball's Nomination As Navy Secretary Wins Senate Approval</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate has approved the nomination ofWilliam Ball III to be Navy secretary, replacing James H.
