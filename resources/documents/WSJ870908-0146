Shigeru Senzaki, company president, told a hurriedly called news conference yesterday in Osaka that Tateho can rehabilitate itself if its eight main banks agree to extend financial assistance.    His announcement came hours after the Osaka Stock Exchange suspended trading in Tateho stock to give investors time to confirm the Sunday news reports. After Mr. Senzaki's strong denial of the reports, the exchange said normal trading in Tateho would be restored today.    Tateho said Saturday it could reconstruct its corporate finances if Taiyo Kobe Bank and seven other banks agreed to allow it to freeze the payment of principal on short-term debt of about 20 billion yen ($142.2 million).    The Kansai-based company announced last week that it is facing 20 billion yen in paper losses from trading in Japanese government bonds and futures, exceeding its shareholder equity of 16.9 billion yen. The news caused Japanese bond and equities markets to tumble.    In a news conference Saturday, Tadashi Kawabe, Tateho chairman, said he believes Nikko Securities Co. should assume a responsibility for the investments in government bond futures.    Nikko had acted as the lead-manager for past bond floatations by Tateho and had advised the company regarding portfolio investment strategy. Tateho has invested substantial parts of its investment funds through Nikko, according to securities industry sources.    &quot;It is hard to disclose (the details concerning Nikko's responsibility) until we complete reconstructing our company,&quot; Mr. Kawabe said.    Mr. Senzaki said Tateho has asked its main banks to allow it to draw out its liquid deposits to repay its borrowings of 1.2 billion yen from Chugoku Bank in an impact loan that falls due Thursday. He added, &quot;Tateho has enough liquid deposits to repay the borrowings.&quot;    Tateho is understood to have deposits plus interests amounting to some four billion yen. Its liquid deposits include current deposits and deposits at call.    However, banking industry sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Tateho's eight main banks will refuse it financial assistance if it agrees to repay only its borrowings to Chugoku Bank.    The sources, noting that Tateho's borrowings of short-term funds from other banks will fall due by the end of September, said, &quot;if Tateho agreed to repay borrowings only to Chugoku Bank, the eight main banks would not be able to extend financial assistance in concert.&quot;    Mr. Senzaki said Taiyo Kobe Bank had promised to lend Tateho operating funds in harmony with its monthly sales of 500 million yen for the time being.    He stressed that the company is not considering laying off workers. It has a work force of 291 and is the top maker of electro-melting magnesia for electric heaters, with 90% of the market.    No trading in Tateho stock has occurred since Wednesday because of an absence of bidders, but the stock was not actually suspended until yesterday. The stock was offered Friday at 1,020 yen, down from 1,820 yen Tuesday.    An Osaka exchange official said that the exchange's investigation into possible insider trading in Tateho stock is continuing. Last week, the exchange asked brokers for detailed information on investors in Tateho stock, and is now waiting for responses to those requests. The investigation could take two to three months.    The exchange is also investigating possible insider trading in other stocks, but those probes have no connection to the Tateho case, the official said. </TEXT></DOC>
