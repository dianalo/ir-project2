With half the 566 seats on 26 district councils declared, gainswere forecast on the Roman Catholic side for the Democratic andLabor Party and a patchy result for Sinn Fein, the legal politicalwing of the outlawed Irish Republican Army.   Among the Protestants, who outnumber Catholics 3-2, heavy losseswere projected for Rev. Ian Paisley's hard-line Democratic UnionistParty.   Four candidates who won in affluent, Protestant North Down ranas Conservatives in an effort to lure Prime Minister MargaretThatcher's party into the fray.   The hopes of Sinn Fein, which backs the IRA war against Britishrule in the province, hung on the vote from its Belfast stronghold,to be counted Friday.   Ulster TV forecast a 5 percent drop for Paisley's party to 19.4percent, and a 2.7-percent gain for its more moderate rival, theOfficial Unionists, to 32.6 percent.   It projected a 1.6 percent gain for SDLP moderates to 19.4percent, and a 3 percent fall for Sinn Fein to 8.8 percent.   A BBC-TV projection gave the SDLP 20.6 percent, and Sinn Fein11.1 percent.   ``Everywhere we stood our vote has gone up very well,'' saidSDLP leader John Hume.   But the slow hand-count and the complex proportionalrepresentation system meant surprises could still come before thetwo-day tally is complete.   The SDLP looked set for its best local election performance, butwas in no mood to write off Sinn Fein.   ``There seems to be a fairly uniform pattern of marginal declinein the Sinn Fein vote in the rural areas. It may not be reflectedin Belfast,'' said the SDLP's Alban Maginnis.   Danny McGuinness of the Alliance, the province's only mixedCatholic-Protestant party, said the election appeared to reflect``a shift toward the center parties, away from the DUP and SinnFein.''   ``I think that for long time people wanted to see some movementin politics in Northern Ireland,'' he said.   Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams blamed his party's showing on agovernment ban on broadcast interviews with Sinn Fein members. Buthe admitted that a series of bungled IRA attacks that killedinnocent bystanders may also have alienated voters.   ``The censorship factor, our own organization ... and perhapsthe IRA factor, have all contributed perhaps in preventing SinnFein from advancing its vote,'' he said.   But ``our aim was to consolidate our vote and we appear to bedoing that,'' he said.   Sinn Fein's vote looked solid in its urban strongholds, but downin many rural areas.   In Enniskillen, where a IRA bomb killed 11 Protestants in 1987,Sinn Fein local leader Paul Corrigan's vote fell from 2,360 to1,781 _ a setback in a sparsely populated rural district.   Paisley said his party's losses reflected a Protestant communitysplit between those west of the Bann River who are more exposed toIRA attack than those in urban areas east of the Bann.   ``Many of our (urban) voters did not come out and stand with ourharassed brothers and sisters on the other side of the Bann,'' hesaid.   But his Official Unionist opponents said the reason was amilitant Paisley-led campaign against the 1985 Anglo-IrishAgreement.   That accord, signed by Britain and Ireland, gave Dublin a say inthe running of the province and provoked overwhelming outrage fromthe Protestant majority, which regards Ireland as a hostile,Catholic-dominated state.   But where the Official Unionists opted for lawful, peacefulprotest, the Democratic Unionists tried boycotts and civildisobedience.   Official Unionist John Taylor said the election showed hisparty's opposition ``directed within the law, has won widespreadconsent.   ``We have now advanced beyond 30 percent of public support whichis a great barrier to break through, and it looks as though ... wewill also get more than 200 seats for the first time, which isexcellent news,'' he said.   But the Democratic Unionists' Sammy Wilson said his party lostsupport for not resisting the Anglo-Irish Agreement vigorouslyenough.   ``People who are impatient with the campaign against theagreement on the whole feel we should have been rid of theagreement that much quicker,'' he said.   The Belfast Conservatives say it is the failure of mainlandBritish parties to campaign in Northern Ireland that leaves thefield open to local politicians to run politics on sectarian lines.</TEXT></DOC>
