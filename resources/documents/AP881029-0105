The rebel leader also claimed the American hostages in Lebanonare held by the Iranian terrorists, not by Moslem extremist groupsas is widely believed.   The Americans are held in a special underground base near Baalbekin the Bekaa Valley of southern Lebanon, said Ali Reza Jaferzadeh,chief spokesman for the anti-government People's MujahedeenOrganization. He spoke to The Associated Press in Baghdad.   He said the terrorists were recruited from Iran's RevolutionaryGuards.   He said the terrorist unit is controlled by Hashemi Rafsanjani,speaker of Iran's Parliament and acting commander in chief of itsarmed forces, and receives logistical support from the IranianEmbassy in Damascus, Syria.   ``The American hostages are held at Sheikh Abdullah Base of theRevolutionary Guards in Baalbeck,'' the rebel said. ``The man who isin charge of the base is a commander of the (Revolutionary) Guardsdivision in Lebanon, whose name is Khascar.''   Kidnappers hold nine Americans captive in Lebanon, in addition toseven other foreigner. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson,chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who wasabducted March 16, 1985.   The hostages are believed held by Iranian-backed Moslem extremistgroups, which have periodically released photographs and videos ofthe hostages and made demands in exchange for their release.   Jaferzadeh said the Iranian unit works with otherIranian-financed terrorist groups in Lebanon, such as the IslamicJihad and Hezbollah. He said those groups also take orders directlyfrom Rafsanjani.   Jaferzadeh said the terrorist unit has targeted members of hisgroup.   He said the unit represents one of many ``hunting squads'' set upby the Iranian government to kill or kidnap opponents in othercountries.   ``They have received special training in a (Revolutionary) Guardscamp near Tehran before they were dispatched to Turkey,'' he said.   He said a Mujahedeen activist, Abul Hassan Mojtahedzadeh, waskidnapped while walking across Aqsary Square in Istanbul, Turkey onOct. 11 and tortured by Iranian agents.   Turkish authorities have said two Iranian diplomats and two otherIranians tried to kidnap an Iranian engineer in Istanbul. Thediplomats were asked to leave.   Jaferzadeh also said the Iranian agents killed a Saudi diplomatin Ankara as part of a separate campaign aimed at diplomats ofunfriendly Arab countries. A group calling itself Islamic Jihad inHijaz earlier claimed responsibility for that attack.</TEXT></DOC>
