The decision came as West German volunteers said they were``within a few meters'' (yards) of reaching the debris from acrowded coffeehouse engulfed in Thursday's landslide.   Up to 100 people were buried in the slide, which also swallowedup a restaurant and an empty high school.   ``We are angry. We should have been permitted to go on ... thereis a slight chance that people are alive in the coffeehousebasement,'' said Hans Ruhl, a deputy director of the German RescueDog Association.   Rescue efforts were halted while a new causeway was built tocarry off excavated earth.   ``There is constant danger of new landslide and of a cave-in andflooding if the West Germans continue. We are engineers, we knowthe dangers,'' said Erkan Omarbeyoglu, Trabzon regional highwaydirector.   Three West Germans who were in the coffeehouse were among themissing, along with 43 Turks, according to regional officials.   There were reports that two British tourists also were in thecoffeehouse, but some witnesses said the two had left before thedisaster.   ``It is my opinion there's little chance now for finding anyonealive and it lessens every hour,'' said Ruhl.   Officials said it could take a month to clear 500,000 tons ofearth, rock and uprooted trees blocking the road from the Black Seaport of Trabzon to eastern Anatolia and Iran.   Geologists were surveying the hillside that collapsed but it wasnot clear whether they would blast away another chunk that might bedislodged.   ``This is a great calamity for our village. We had 10 buses and300 trucks coming through every day,'' said Riza Yavuz, the villageheadman.   Catak lies 19 miles from Trabzon among hazelnut and cherryorchards in the shadow of spectacular mountains.   Trabzon was famous as Trebizond in medieval times as the capitalof a breakaway Byzantine state and later birthplace of the OttomanSultan Suleiman Magnificent.   Villagers blamed the landslide on what they said was shoddyconstruction when the highway was widened three years ago to handleincreasing truck and tourist traffic.   The construction workers blasted the hillside and then failed toshore up a 139-foot-high escarpment, the villagers said.   ``I knew it would eventually collapse,'' Yavuz said.   He said the villagers appeal to the Public Works Ministry inAnkara just brought ``promises they would deal with the problemeventually.''   The landslide hit the coffeehouse when it was full of buspassengers and truck drivers who had waited all night forbulldozers to clear an earlier rock fall blocking the road.   ``It was standing room only in the coffeehouse and people hadbeen watching television there through the night,'' said NizamettinOzturk.   Ozturk said his house was flooded when a fast flowing streamrunning through the village jammed with rocks and soil and changedcourse.</TEXT></DOC>
