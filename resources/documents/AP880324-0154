(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Mayor Lee Alexander was sentencedto 10 years in prison today for extorting $1.5 million in kickbacksfrom businessmen during his years as the city's top electedofficial.   Alexander, 60, pleaded guilty Jan. 6 to charges of racketeering,conspiracy to obstruct a government investigation and tax evasionin connection with what federal prosecutors called one of thebiggest public corruption cases ever uncovered in New York state.   At his sentencing, Alexander, who once served as president ofthe U.S. Conference of Mayors, also was ordered by U.S. DistrictJudge Thomas J. McAvoy to pay $100,000 in restitution to the Cityof Syracuse in lieu of a $100,000 fine recommended by federalprosecutors.   ``I've brought great pain to my loved ones and the people of mycity and stand here now ready for my punishment,'' Alexander saidbefore sentence was pronounced.   Alexander said his demise occurred when an effort to build apolitical war chest was ``allowed to grow into a cancer.''   Before Alexander's 10-minute speech to the judge, his attorney,Harold Boreanaz, made an impassioned plea for leniency.   Boreanaz rebutted statements made by prosecutors that Alexanderhad not fully cooperated with the government's efforts to identifyand turn over his assets.   Alexander would be eligible for parole after serving a third ofhis sentence. U.S. Attorney Frederick Scullin said Alexander mustsurrender by April 14 and would serve his sentence at amedium-security federal prison that has yet to be determined.   The former mayor faced nearly seven centuries in prison afterbeing named in a 40-count federal grand jury indictment thataccused him of 65 separate acts of extortion.   Alexander earlier surrendered to the government more than $1.4million in assets the government has linked with theextortion-kickback scheme he admitted running during his four termsas Syracuse's chief executive between 1970 and 1986.   The former mayor was to have been sentenced on March 10 butquestions by the government about whether Alexander had withheldany assets caused McAvoy to delay sentencing until today. Alexandermet with government attorneys for more than 20 hours and submittedto at least two polygraph tests during the past two weeks.   Alexander was indicted July 16, 1986, by a special grand juryinvestigating public corruption in Syracuse. Alexander initiallydenied the charges, but the the overwhelming and highly detailedevidence, including testimony from Alexander's pick-up men andother co-conspirators, caused him to seek a plea bargain.</TEXT></DOC>
