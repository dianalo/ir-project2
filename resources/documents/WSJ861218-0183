The technology speeds production of drugs and other substances extracted from mammalian cell cultures.    Those mammalian cells with genes that have been artificially altered so that the cells produce desired substances usually secrete very small amounts of the substances. Damon Biotech said its technology induces the cells to make larger amounts, simplifying large-scale production of genetically engineered substances.    The biotechnology concern said it has used the technology to accelerate production of tissue-plasminogen activator, an experimental drug that dissolves blood clots, and other drugs.    Damon Biotech is 60%-owned by Damon Corp., which provides medical-testing services and makes medical and electronic products. </TEXT></DOC>
