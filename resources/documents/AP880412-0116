On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May-delivery contractfor West Texas Intermediate crude rose 4 cents per barrel to $17.93early today after closing up $1.01 Monday at $17.89, the highestclose since mid-December.   Refined products traded on the exchange were mixed after largeadvances Monday. Wholesale heating oil fell 0.26 cent a gallonafter rising 2.42 cents during the previous session to 47.88 cents.Wholesale unleaded gasoline rose .10 cent a gallon to 51.05 centsafter a 2.18-cent rise the previous session.   Elsewhere, several major U.S. oil companies, reacting to thejump in crude prices, announced 50-cent increases in the price theypay for West Texas Intermediate.   Traders attributed the jumps to a weekend meeting of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' price-monitoringcommittee, which stated it would enlist help from non-OPECproducers to restrain output.   A one-day surge in crude-oil prices does not necessarily meanhigher retail prices later. But if the market sustains theincrease, some analysts say, American consumers could be paying anadditional 10 to 12 cents a gallon for gasoline by the peak of thesummer season.   ``This is not a flash in the pan. This is the beginning of abull move,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant director of EldersFutures Inc., a New York energy futures trading concern. ``The realstory is the oil market cycle has turned; it's ready to go higher.''   Others discounted the move as a temporary spike in a market thatremains basically unchanged. They attributed it to misinformedspeculation about OPEC's strategy and influence.   ``I see the OPEC thing as a fairly empty public relationsgesture,'' said Carol Epstein, analyst at Petroleum Analysis Ltd.,a New York consulting and publishing concern. ``I don't see anyfundamental turning around here.''   Ms. Epstein said her view was based partly on efforts by someOPEC members, notably key producer Saudi Arabia, to move into therefining or ``downstream'' end of the oil business. This suggestsOPEC itself believes the surplus of crude oil on world markets willpersist, which makes refining more attractive.   Nevertheless, some analysts said the move by the OPEC pricemonitoring committee was significant because the idea forcooperation was initiated by eight non-OPEC exporters.   Emissaries from Mexico, China, Oman, Angola, Colombia, Egypt,Brunei and Malaysia, who met last month, concluded thatcoordination with OPEC could help combat weak prices and excessivesupplies.   ``There's momentum to have detente between OPEC and non-OPECproducers,'' said Daniel Yergen, president of Cambridge EnergyResearch Associates, a petroleum market consulting company inCambridge, Mass. ``This would be a major shift in that direction.It's bullish for higher prices.''   OPEC's 13 members produce about 17.5 million barrels daily.Production from the non-OPEC exporters interested in cooperatingwith OPEC totals about 8 million barrels daily. An agreementbetween them would affect production that accounts for more thanhalf the consumption in the non-communist world.   But skepticism persists that OPEC could engineer an agreement torestrain production among countries outside its jurisdiction. Someanalysts emphasize that OPEC has faced difficulty enforcinginternal discipline.   ``Controlling production with 21 or so players isn't easy,''said Stephen Smith, a petroleum analyst with Bear Stearns Cos. inNew York. ``Keeping 13 guys in line is tough enough.''   Others said OPEC's previously failed efforts to maintain priceshad erased much of the once-mighty cartel's credibility, suggestingits move to enlist support from non-OPEC exporters also was doomed.   ``My attitude has been, talk is cheap with that crowd,'' saidJohn O'Dea, manager of international energy futures at Dean WitterReynolds Inc. in New York. ``I think in the final analysis, theyhave to produce some viable kind of agreement, and they haven'tbeen able to do it for the past year. Why should they do it now?''</TEXT></DOC>
