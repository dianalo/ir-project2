Thus, theU.S.S.R. is scrapping daylight-saving time this month, butclocks will &quot;fall back&quot; an hour this fall.   &quot;In 1930, it was decided to introduce summer time and movethe hands of clocks one hour ahead,&quot; the newspaper EveningMoscow explained. &quot;They did not announce winter time&quot; in thefall of 1930. &quot;Summer time&quot; wasn't reintroduced in the springof 1931, leaving the country with a single time year round.   A spring 1981 change gave two extra sunlight hours insteadof one as intended. And that, an official said, is why &quot;allthese years we've been one hour ahead of the real time zone.&quot;   Clocks in the U.S.S.R., which has 11 time zones, areusually advanced an hour on March 31. But a decree, announcedWednesday, canceled this for Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan,Byelorussia, Turkmenia and the Ukraine. Estonia, Latvia,Lithuania and Moldavia will move their clocks ahead. ButTadzhikistan, parts of Kazakstan and other regions will settheir clocks back an hour to organize daylight hours better.                                                                                                          FRANCE SEEKS TO PROTECT FIRMS                                                                                                          France, concerned that Iraq could dun French companiesonce the United Nations embargo is lifted, is pressing itsGulf war allies to include a protective clause in any U.N.resolution ending sanctions against Iraq. Paris is worriedthat unless Iraqi responsibility for the embargo'sconsequences is established, Baghdad could claim at leastthree billion French francs ($536.9 million) from performancebonds tied to French companies' unfinished contracts,interrupted after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last August.                                                                                                          FINNISH ISLANDS TO ISSUE CASH                                                                                                          The Finnish Aeland Islands will issue its own money. ButFinland's central bank is studying the legality of revivingthe taler, legal tender in Germany between the 15th and 19thcenturies. Finnish monetary law applies on theSwedish-speaking archipelago off southwest Finland that wonsemi-autonomous status in 1920. Coins denominated in 10, 50and 100 taler will be available April 26. The taler will havethe same value as the islands' official money unit, theFinnish markka.                                                                                                          NEW ZEALAND OPENS ITS MEDIA                                                                                                          Wellington will lift all restrictions on foreigninvestment in television and radio broadcasting, in a movedesigned to rescue TV3 Network Ltd., New Zealand's onlyprivate TV channel. The limit was to have been increased to49.9% from 14.9% for TV and 24.9% for radio. But financialills of TV3, in receivership since May, prompted the openingto 100%.                                                                                                          INDIA SHARPLY LIMITS IMPORTS                                                                                                          New Delhi restricted imports to stem depletion in itshard-currency reserves. A central bank official confirmed thepossibility of a request to India's major creditors, theU.S., Germany and Japan, for an unprecedented rescheduling ofloans to avoid defaulting. India's foreign loans total about$46 billion, and 1992 interest payments will top $1 billion.The central bank told commercial banks it won't releaseforeign exchange to private importers to pay for capitalgoods, and tightened conditions for private credit.                                                                                                          BRAZIL OIL STRIKE TO END                                                                                                          Leaders of a nationwide oil workers strike involving 19unions in Brazil voted to end the 23-day walkout. Somerefineries reopened. The government oil monopoly Petrobrashad threatened to fire workers who stayed out and a laborcourt ruled the strike illegal. A union official saidBrasilia granted some pay and rehiring concessions andnon-punishment for strikers, but rejected a 161% pay boost.                                                                                                          EC FIRES SALVO ON ENERGY                                                                                                          The European Community Commission fired a first, cautioussalvo in a battle to end monopolies' hold on EC energysupplies. It challenged laws in 10 member states that givenational utilities the exclusive right to import and exportelectricity and natural gas.   Despite progress on its single-market program, the EC'senergy market remains fragmented in 12 national segments.Most of these markets are dominated by state-controlled, andoften state-owned, utilities.   Industrial energy users complain that the lack ofcompetition helps maintain high energy prices. For example,gas prices are 50% higher in the EC than in the U.S., whichderegulated the gas-distribution industry in the 1980s.   If the challenged states don't alter their laws, thecommission can sue them. Still, the move appears to besymbolic, aimed at testing governments' reactions. Endingenergy import monopolies will be of little benefit to usersseeking cheaper supplies if they are denied access tonational distribution grids.

President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, the first leaderof an East European country in an official visit to the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization, said former Communist nationsare slipping into a security vacuum and urged NATO to forgecloser ties with them. . . . The Mini Minor, a squat littlecar that took Europe by storm in the 1960s, will reappear inLatin America. A Venezuelan company, Facorca, has begunproducing a version of the British car, and hopes to turn out10,000 a year by 1994.</TEXT></DOC>
