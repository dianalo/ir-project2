One hundred thirty-eight plants and an estimated 302,000 workerswill take part in an effort similar to those being undertaken byChrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. last year and earlier this year,Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said Tuesday.   The GM pact is part of a settlement of government charges thatthe nation's largest automaker violated safety and health rules atplants in Trenton, N.J., and Oklahoma City, Okla. GM will pay$360,000 in fines for the alleged violations.   ``The transformation of the workplace required by this agreementwon't be possible overnight,'' said Stephen P. Yokich, a UAW vicepresident. ``But if we are to make progress, there must be animmediate recognition by the management at each individual plant ofthe full extent of the problem.''   A spokeswoman said GM would have no immediate comment.   Repetitive motion traumas, also referred to as cumulative traumadisorders, are disorders of the musculoskeletal and nervous systemscaused by repetitive motions or exertion over extended periods.   Painful and sometimes crippling, they range from back injuriesto a nerve disorder of the hand and wrist to various tendonailments. They comprise about 48 percent of the workplace injuriesfor which the department's Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration keeps records.   Preventive measures include redesigning work stations t betteraccommodate the body by, for example, adjusting workbench heights.Also, devices can be used to prevent excessive lifting or similarexertions. Tools and training can be redesigned.      ---</TEXT><HEAD>Judge Refuses Bail For Son Of Interior Secretary</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge has refused bail to the son ofInterior Secretary Manuel Lujan, saying Robert Jeffrey Lujan, whowas arrested on a rape charge, was ``an unreasonable danger'' tothe community.   Circuit Court Judge Donald M. Haddock in suburban Alexandria,Va., on Tuesday rejected an appeal from Lujan's attorney who arguedthat the young man was not a threat to flee and had no history ofviolent behavior.   Lujan's attorney, Robert Powell, said he would take the case tothe Virginia Court of Appeals.   Lujan, 28, was arrested Wednesday and held without bail oncharges of raping a woman resident of the same apartment buildingwhere Lujan lives with his parents.   The 48-year-old woman testified she awoke to find Lujan - nakedand armed with a shotgun - sitting on her bed.   Powell has said Lujan has admitted spending several hours in thewoman's apartment, but added the woman invited him to the apartmentand that the sexual relations were consentual.   Manuel Lujan said after the arrest that his son, who had afederal felony drug conviction in 1983, has a severe drinkingproblem.      ---</TEXT><HEAD>New AIDS Vaccine Candidate Approved For Early Clinical Trials</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new AIDS vaccine candidate that has beenshown to work in one chimpanzee has won approval for early humanclinical tests.   The candidate vaccine approved for further testing by the Foodand Drug Administration was developed through the cooperation ofthe National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, theNational Cancer Institute and Immuno-U.S., Inc., a Rochester, Mich.branch of an Austrian company.   At a news conference Tuesday, company officials said theclinical trials will test the safety of the vaccine and determinewhether the 60 test subjects develop antibodies against humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. Thisfirst step of human testing, called Phase I trials, will not useAIDS patients.   If the vaccine proves to be safe and shows promise, then PhaseII trials will more thoroughly test for protection against AIDS. Afinal phase of testing would be required before the FDA releasesthe vaccine for general use.   The candidate vaccine is a genetically-engineered syntheticglycoprotein that was derived from the envelope, or skin, of theHIV1 virus. This part of the virus envelope is called gp160. Thetheory is that the body's immune system will react to gp160 anddevelop antibodies. These antibodies then would trigger an immuneresponse in the body should there be contact with the HIV virus.   Dr. Martha Eibl, director of AIDS vaccine research at Immuno AG,the parent company of Immuno-U.S., said that two forms of thevaccine were tested on four chimpanzees.   The chimps were injected with the candidate vaccine and theninjected with the AIDS virus, using a dose that is 100 times theamount needed to cause an infection in the laboratory.   All four of the chimps developed some immune response, and oneof the animals remained free of AIDS.   ``It has protected a chimp from productive infection for nearlythree years,'' Eibl said of the candidate vaccine. ``That is thelongest protection up to now.''</TEXT></DOC>
