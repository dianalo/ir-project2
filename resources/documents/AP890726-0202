Mike Synar,D-Okla., prior to House approval of the measure, which put off adecision on the final fate of the radar-evading bomber until nextyear.   The crucial vote Wednesday was 257-160, with 49 Republicansjoining 208 Democrats to limit production of thehalf-billion-dollar plane.   The House action, part of its work on the $295 billion militarybudget, was a setback for Bush, who personally lobbied lawmakersfor the aircraft.   The administration suffered another budget cut later in the daywhen the House approved an amendment to reduce by $502 million the$1.1 billion in spare missiles and for a rail basing system Bushrequested for the MX missile. The vote, which was 224-197, does notaffect the nearly $800 million earmarked for the missiles.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, on Capitol Hill to meet withlawmakers, said House passage of the B-2 amendment ``createsproblems for the program.''   ``But at least it lets us get through the House with the programhaving been approved and now we'll go to conference, hopefully witha stronger position from the Senate,'' said Cheney, a formercongressman from Wyoming.   ``Anything that's done by way of delay or stretch-out is simplygoing to raise the cost of the program,'' he added.   The production-limiting amendment, sponsored by Rep. Les Aspin,D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and Synar,allows the administration production funds for only two new bombersin 1990 and 1991. The Pentagon had sought eight bombers.   The action sets up a confrontation with the Senate, which voted98-1 Tuesday to back the bomber if it meets flight test andradar-evasion standards.   The Senate trimmed Bush's $4.7 billion B-2 request for the nextfiscal year by a relatively modest $300 million.   Once the House and Senate complete their versions of the defensebill, the two chambers will meet in conference to work out a finalmeasure. The administration expressed the hope that a B-2 programresembling the White House request will still prevail.   ``The Aspin amendment regrettably delays the program. It weakensour negotiating position (in arms-reduction talks) since it showsless than a full commitment to the manned bomber leg of ourtriad,'' said White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk. ``We hope torestore the program in conference.''   The House amendment on the bomber would meet theadministration's full request for research and development workover the next two years but would limit procurement money and thencut it off unless Congress acts again.   Aspin argued Wednesday that the Air Force, which wants 132aircraft, has ``hardly tested this plane.''   ``What this amendment does is say slow down the program, do theresearch and development and fence the program,'' said theWisconsin Democrat, who described his approach as one that wouldprovide time to ``come up with a program that is politicallyacceptable and more affordable.''   Following the vote, Synar said, ``The message today is thatNorthrop, the Air Force, the administration have got to get thisprogram in order.''   Rep. John Rowland, R-Conn., said bluntly of the B-2, ``We didn'tground it but we sure clipped its wings.''   Aspin said that in the next year the administration must ``makethe argument about where the Soviets are going with their airdefenses ... convince us that it's worth spending some money onthis program.''   The manned, bat-winged bomber, which costs $530 million a copy,is built to penetrate Soviet air defenses.   Earlier in the day, the House rejected an even harsher amendmentsponsored by the odd coalition of liberal Democrat Ron Dellums ofCalifornia and Republicans John Kasich of Ohio and Rowland. Itwould have stopped production after the 13 planes now in thepipeline are completed, with no new ones started in 1990 or 1991.   Rowland reminded members that the Pentagon is seeking more than$24 billion over a three-year peak spending period in the 1990s forthe bomber. ``Does anyone in this chamber believe we'll spend $8billion in one year?'' he asked.   But the House rejected that argument by a vote of 279-144.   The House also rejected an amendment that would have effectivelyendorsed the administration's overall $70 billion program, thoughcutting $800 million from Bush's request of $4.7 billion for theprogram in fiscal 1990. The vote was 244-176.   The House approved an amendment extending the current lawlimiting deployment of the MX missile to 50 to all deployed MXmissiles.   But the House turned down an amendment to cancel the MX mobilemissile and single-warhead Midgetman missile, rejected a measure tocancel the Midgetman only and turned back a provision that wouldhave prohibited the Air Force from using research and developmentmoney on moving the existing 50 MX missiles from fixed silos torailroad cars.   The House Armed Services Committee had endorsed theadministration's request of $1.1 billion for the MX missile and$100 million for the Midgetman.</TEXT></DOC>
