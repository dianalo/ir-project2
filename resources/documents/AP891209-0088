The 12-member EC announced its support after West GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl said Bonn would not try to reclaimterritories the German states held before World War II.   ``We have a responsibility toward our neighbors. We want to donothing destabilizing,'' Kohl said as the EC completed a two-daysummit in this French city on the German border.   Eventual reunification seems possible in light of the politicalupheaval in Communist East Germany. But the prospect has raisedfears that a large German state would upset the political andeconomic balance in Europe. Bonn's powerhouse economy alreadydominates the European Community.   ``I am not afraid of reunification,'' said French PresidentFrancois Mitterrand. ``I consider it to be legitimate.''   But he also said countries must abide by international treatiesand other obligations ``unless they are prepared to createdangerous and unnecessary tensions.''   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who failed to slowthe EC's drive toward European economic integration, still praisedthe outcome of the summit.   Despite their disagreements, she said, the leaders showed they``can act as the driving force for the development of the whole ofEurope at a turning point in the continent's history.''   Added Mitterrand: ``Henceforth there is no longer a Europe intwo parts, acting in the shadows or at the initative of the twosuperpowers.''   The 12 leaders issued a joint statement that said: ``We seek thestrengthening of the state of peace in Europe in which the Germanpeople will regain its unity through free self-determination.   ``This process should take place peacefully and democratically.''   Reunification also should occur, the statement said, in thecontext of the 1975 Helsinki accords on European cooperation andsecurity, which permanently fixed postwar borders.   The wording of the statement was agreed to after Dutch PrimeMinister Ruud Lubbers and Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreottipressed Kohl at a dinner Friday night for his definition ofreunification.   Belgian and Dutch sources, demanding anonymity, said Kohl madeclear that reunification applied only to the two existing Germannations and not to German-speaking areas in neighboring countries.   Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens said it was ``the mosttense moment'' of an otherwise low-key summit.   In their final statement, the leaders said they had no intentionof taking advantage of the upheavals in communist Eastern Europe.They promised to build up the weakened economies of emergingdemocracies and agreed to set up a European development bank tohelp.   The EC ``remains the cornerstone of a new European architectureand ... a mooring for a future European equilibrium,'' thestatement said.   Overriding Mrs. Thatcher's objections, the other 11 leadersagreed to hold a special conference next December in Italy torewrite parts of their founding Treaty of Rome.   The changes would be needed to carry out a sweeping plan foreconomic and monetary union that would lead to a common Europeancurrency and system of central banks. Any treaty revisions wouldrequire unanimous approval.   Mrs. Thatcher objected to monetary integration, saying it wouldrob member countries of sovereign rights to decide nationaleconomic policy.   She also was alone in opposing the summit's adoption of a``social charter'' on employment and other worker rights. Mrs.Thatcher said the non-binding charter would increase unemployment,raise costs and make EC goods less competitive.   Common Market members are Britain, Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg,the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugaland Greece.</TEXT></DOC>
