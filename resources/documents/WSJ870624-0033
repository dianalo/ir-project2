The provisions are part of legislation to raise new capital for the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.    The measure would revive until March 1990 legislation, passed in 1982 but allowed to expire last year, that would permit the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to arrange the interstate acquisition of failed banks with assets of $500 million or more. In addition, the FDIC would be allowed to establish and operate new national banks to temporarily take over the operations of failed institutions.    In its first session yesterday, the conference committee didn't discuss the divisive issues in the bill, including the size of the FSLIC's recapitalization, a curb on limited-service banks and a temporary ban on new powers for banks to expand their activities.    The conference is to meet again today. </TEXT></DOC>
