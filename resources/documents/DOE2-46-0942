<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-46-0942 </DOCNO><TEXT>This invention relates to a process for purifying flue gases developedduring the combustion of waste materials and containing solids of variouscompositions as well as pollutant gases and heavy metals in gaseous form.In such a process, the primarily solid components are removed from theflue gas in a separating system and are collected as fly ashes. The fluegas is washed for the purpose of binding the pollutant gases of the residualsolids components, particularly in the slag formed in the combustionprocess. It is the object of this invention to provide a process wherein,during flue gas purification, the gaseous heavy metal contaminants aswell as the heavy metal contaminants which are present in the fly ashand in the slag in soluble form, can be removed from the flue gas purificationprocess in the most compact form, whilst simultaneously achieving good,or even improved, initial purification of HCl, SO/sub 2/ and NO/sub x/.All other residues should be returnable for further use. The remainderof heavy metal components which are not bound in the slag are isolatedfrom the slag by a subsequent weak acid treatment.</TEXT></DOC>
