The justices left intact a rule issued in 1985 by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that requires some pipelines to transport gas that companies buy from a source other than the pipelines.    The provisions of the so-called &quot;open access&quot; rule took effect after a federal appeals court here upheld most of the FERC order last June. The appeals court agreed with FERC that pipelines had engaged in &quot;discriminatory practices&quot; against companies that bought gas directly from producers and sought only transportation from pipelines. FERC said this discrimination deprived consumers of the most competitive prices.    The FERC rule reduced the burden of the federal licensing process, providing more freedom from regulation for pipelines that agreed to offer &quot;open access.&quot;    Carmen Legato, a lawyer here who handled the case for the Maryland People's Counsel, said many pipelines have already opened up such access. But he added: &quot;This is probably the last hurrah for any pipelines that were holding out. There is no longer any uncertainty whatsoever about the legal status of the commission's order.&quot;    The Interstate Natural Gas Association, a pipeline trade group, said that the rule is transforming pipelines into &quot;common carriers&quot; and that FERC lacks the authority to implement such a change. The group said the rule &quot;has threatened the financial and operational base of the pipeline industry.&quot;    The appeals court last June ordered FERC to reconsider parts of the rule, saying FERC needed to address the problem of pipelines that are locked into &quot;take-or-pay&quot; contracts with producers. Such contracts, typically negotiated years ago at rates higher than current market prices, require a pipeline to take a contract amount of gas or pay for a high percentage of it anyway. The Supreme Court also refused to hear industry appeals questioning the appeals court's decision ordering the FERC review.    Political Parties   The justices agreed to decide whether states may bar state political parties from endorsing candidates in primary elections. The court also will review other aspects of California's election law. The restriction on endorsements, as well as requirements for membership or chairmanship of state party committees, were struck down by a federal appeals court in San Francisco last August.    The appeals court ruled that the restrictions violated First Amendment guarantees of free speech and free association for party officials. The secretary of state and attorney general of California appealed to the Supreme Court.    TWA Appeal   The high court left intact a federal appeals-court order for trial of a securities-fraud lawsuit filed against Trans World Airlines by shareholders who bought a new stock offering in 1983.    The lawsuit charges that TWA's July 1983 securities registration didn't disclose that its parent company at the time, Transworld Corp., was considering making TWA an independent company. Shareholders approved that decision in December 1983, and it took effect Feb. 1, 1984. However, company officials deny that there was any such plan in July 1983 that had to be disclosed.    A federal district-court judge in New York dismissed the lawsuit before trial, but a federal appeals court there ruled 2-1 last November that the lawsuit raised enough questions for a trial.    Suing a State   The justices agreed to decide whether states may be sued for damages in their own courts under a Civil War-era federal civil-rights law that has been used widely against local governments in state and federal courts. In federal courts, the 11th Amendment to the Constitution gives states immunity from such lawsuits, but that immunity doesn't apply in state courts.    The law, passed in 1871, allows lawsuits for damages against any &quot;person&quot; who &quot;under color of state law&quot; interferes with another's civil rights. The question for the high court is whether a state, or its officials acting for the state, may be a &quot;person&quot; subject to civil-rights lawsuits for damages. The Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the state couldn't be sued for civil-rights damages. The Michigan court threw out a $153,233 award for a state employee who was denied a promotion because the state police maintained a secret file on his brother's political actions.    Other Cases   In other action yesterday, the Supreme Court:   --Agreed to hear Reagan administration arguments that public parts of Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal records needn't be released under the Freedom of Information Act.    --Said it will review the Internal Revenue Service's policy of disallowing tax deductions for money paid to the Church of Scientology for training and other programs on church doctrine.    --Agreed to decide if U.S. courts may handle a lawsuit against Argentina for attacking a Liberian tanker engaged in &quot;U.S. domestic trade&quot; during the Falkland Islands War in 1982. A federal appeals court said Argentina isn't immune from such a lawsuit.    --Let stand a ruling that federal civil-rights law protects a Boeing Co. worker in Seattle who refused to pay union dues because she said her study of the Bible discouraged it.    --Refused to hear a cosmetics-industry appeal arguing that two color additives were improperly banned by a federal appeals court.    --Left intact a ruling that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey may limit the distances of flights made to and from La Guardia Airport. </TEXT></DOC>
