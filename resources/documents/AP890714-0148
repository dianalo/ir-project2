McCLAIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Both the factory operating rate and industrialproduction fell last month, the government said Friday, providingmore evidence of a slowing economy caused by anti-inflation measures.   The Federal Reserve said the June operating rate declined to 83.5percent, a 0.3 percentage point drop from May. The rate was 84.1percent in April and hit a 10-year high of 84.3 percent in December.   The Fed also said industrial production was off 0.2 percent lastmonth, with its industrial production index standing at 141.1percent of its 1977 base, down from May's 141.4 percent. It was thefirst decline since it fell 0.2 percent in February, which had beenthe first drop in a year.   ``It's really related to the consumer pulling back on autos andother durable goods that go with housing,'' said economist DavidJones of Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co. in New York. ``It was that highinterest rate environment that was really the major source of theweakness.''   Until recently, the Fed has been pushing up interest rates in anattempt to cool inflationary pressures without slowing economicgrowth so much that the economy slides into a recession.   Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association ofManufacturers, said Friday's reports ``are not indications of anemerging slide into recession.''   ``Rather, they should be viewed as the temporary softenss that islikely to be associated with a soft-landing scenario for theeconomy,'' he said.   Analysts also saw the decline in the factory operating rate asfurther lessening of inflationary pressures. The closer thatindustry gets to full operating capacity, the greater difficulty ithas producing enough to meet demand, leading to shortages and priceincreases.   ``The decline in capacity utilization _ which reflects increasedcapital investment as well as slower output growth _ providesadditional confirmation that contrary to previous fears, the economyis not in danger of capacity shortages,'' Jasinowski said.   Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago saidoperating rates for iron, steel, paper and industrial chemicals aredown.   ``These are the industries that were so strong earlier and wherea lot of the inflation was occurring,'' he said.   The manufacturing plant operating rate fell 0.3 percentage pointto 83.8 percent, down from May's 84.1 percent. Prior to April, therate had declined since it peaked at 84.7 percent in January.   The rate at factories producing durable goods, big-ticket itemsexpected to last more than three years, fell 0.3 percentage pointfrom 82.7 percent in May. This reflected in large part a reductionin the production of cars.   The rate at factories producing non-durable goods dropped to 85.8percent, compared with May's 86.0 percent.   Production remained flat at manufacturing plants making bothdurable and non-durable goods.   Output at mines and oil wells fell 1.1 percent after a revised0.3 percent decline in May. Production at utilities dropped 1.3percent in June after a 0.2 percent drop in May.   Jasinowski said output of energy materials should increase whencoal strikes are settled. More than 30,000 coal miners have been onstrike for over a month in Appalachia and the Midwest.   Jasinowski also said warmer weather demands for electric powerwould result in increased utility production this summer.   Last month's factory operating rate was up from 83 percent a yearearlier. The industrial production index was 3.4 percent higher thana year ago.</TEXT></DOC>
