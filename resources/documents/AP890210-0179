He said the community, also known as the Common Market, islimited in suggesting remedies because ``we believe this(prohibition) is in complete conformity with our internationalobligations.''   ``So I think some kind of signal ... would be very helpful,''said Andriessen, a former Dutch finance minister. ``I don't knowwhat can be done. What we cannot do is change fundamentally ourlegislation.''   On Jan. 1, the Common Market barred imports of meat from cattletreated with growth hormones. When the United States refused tocomply and imposed duties on several European products, the EECthreatened its own retaliatory tariffs.   On Thursday, the United States blocked a European demand for aninternational investigation of the American measures.   The community has no new proposals from the United States,Andriessen said, but added that he and Carla Hills, the new U.S.trade representative, had a long telephone conversation late lastweek.   ``Both of us (said) that we should do lots of thinking to findsome kind of solution because ... nobody wants this matter toescalate,'' he said.   Andriessen will travel to Washington at the end of next week tomeet with Mrs. Hills and Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, whowas U.S. trade representative in the Reagan administration. RayMacSharry, the EEC agriculture minister, will join some of the talks.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will be in Brussels nextweek on a tour of Western Europe and has scheduled a meeting withCommon Market officials for Feb. 17.   European foreign ministers are to meet in Brussels three dayslater to decide whether to apply countermeasures against the UnitedStates. Last month, they threatened to impose high duties onAmerican dried fruit and walnuts.   ``The actions of the United States until now are not veryencouraging,'' Andriessen said. Mrs. Hills ``showed a willingness tofind a solution,'' he said, ``but she was not very specific.''   He reported contacts with Texas officials who would like to shiphormone-free beef to Europe, but said any deals must be worked outthrough Washington.   Europeans imposed the hormone ban on grounds the stimulants maypose a health risk, which the United States disputes.   Importation of about $100 million worth of beef and beefbyproducts from the United States is affected. Meat used to make petfood is exempt.   Total trade between the EEC and the United States last year wasan estimated $166 billion.   Asked about prospects for trade relations with the newadministration, Andriessen said President Bush ``is very well awareof the mentality and attitudes on this side of the Atlantic, andthat I think is an advantage.''   He described Yeutter as a ``a determined man (who likes) to getsome results out of negotiations'' and said Mrs. Hills also has areputation for determination.   ``If that is the attitude on both sides, we might have perhapsdifficult negotiations but we couldn't exclude (achieving) resultsas well,'' Andriessen said.   EEC member nations are Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Greece,Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain andWest Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
