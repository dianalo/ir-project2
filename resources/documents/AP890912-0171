William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental ProtectionAgency, strongly contradicted figures released by Rep. Philip R.Sharp, D-Ind., that suggested electric utility customers in the ninestates would pay a disproportionate amount of the cost of reducingacid rain emissions.   At a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce energy and powersubcommittee, chaired by Sharp, Reilly released his own statisticsthat contended the nine states would get a fair deal under the Bushlegislation.   The states are Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Georgia, Ohio,Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri.   Sharp has demanded that electric utility customers in thosestates receive financial help in paying for power plant reductionsof sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, emissions that form the acidrain compound.   This could be accomplished by forcing industries to reduce theiremissions of these same chemicals, or have electric utilitycustomers elsewhere pay part of the tab through special fees.   But Reilly, lawmakers from outside the nine states and at leastone House member from Tennessee, Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper, arguedthat other states' utility customers already are financing the costof reductions made by their own utilities.   Reilly added that plants other than utilities account for just 30percent of the problem, and it would be much more efficient to orderall the reductions from the utilities, which cause 70 percent of thepollution. These are power plants that burn high-sulfur coal, muchof it mined in West Virginia.   Bush's legislation seeks to reduce pollution from toxic airbornechemicals, ozone and the acid rain, which is carried for hundreds ofmiles before falling to earth. Acid rain destroys lakes, killstrees, makes buildings deteriorate and causes lung problems.   The president proposed reducing sulfur dioxide by 10 million tonsby the year 2000, based on 1980 levels, with nine million tonscoming from power plants and one million from industrial emissionreductions already achieved. There would be an emissions ``cap'' toprevent future releases from offsetting the reductions.   Sharp began his hearing Tuesday by citing new figures thatcontend the nine states would be asked to clean up about 77 percentof the acid rain emissions, even though they cause only 50 percentof the problem.   He contended that, in the initial phase of the program, utilitycustomers in the nine states would ``pay for fully 90 percent of theclean-up.''   But Reilly then presented his own statistics, which said that thenine states produced 51 percent of the acid rain emissions but theiractual cleanup costs would only be 50 percent of the total.   ``That's as fair as we can possibly make it,'' he said, addingthe Bush legislation is ``fair to those who cleaned up in the past.It doesn't make them pay to clean up again.''   Sharp contended some utility rates could rise by 20 percent inthe nine states, but Reilly said the five hardest-hit states wouldsee utility bills rise, on the average, a third of a cent perkillowatt-hour by the year 2001.</TEXT></DOC>
