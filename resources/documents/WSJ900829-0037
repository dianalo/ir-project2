What's new are 16-bit game systems and a flood ofnew games for both NEC's Turbo Grafx-16 and Sega. The newtechnology provides faster, more colorful, more complexgames. NEC even has a special CD-ROM reader that connects toits game machine and provides real voices, real music andtherefore has the ability to go beyond the usual shoot andrace games. It's as if there were only action films and wesuddenly discovered drama, mysteries, musicals and comedies.   Last year at this time there were no 16-bit games. Butthis year there are. In Japan for example, in just over twoyears 16-bit sales have taken more than half of the marketand Nintendo faces a tough near-term future. According to twosurveys, more than 30% of current Nintendo-owning boys in theU.S. plan to get a new system this year.</LP><TEXT>   I don't think it's time yet for Mario's wake, but with theincreased competition from such 16-bit systems as NEC's TurboGrafx-16, Mario and Luigi might be looking over theirshoulders as we enter a higher level in the video &quot;game.&quot;   Ken Wirt   Vice President   Home Entertainment   NEC Technologies Inc.   Wood Dale, Ill.   ---   With all due respect to Judge Kozinski, I believe he hasmissed the point in his critique of Nintendo.   He is correct that &quot;the video-games aisle at the Toys `R'Us often is deserted.&quot; But this was July, when parentsencourage their children to play outdoors. Nintendo isoverwhelmingly indoor entertainment. A check of the Nintendoaisle on Oct. 1 will reveal a very different situation.   If there is a &quot;lack of effective competition&quot; in the U.S.video-game market, as Mr. Kozinski claims, this problemshould not be laid at the doorstep of Nintendo. There arecompetitive game systems offered by Sega, Atari and NEC.Nintendo outsells them all together by about 9 to 1.   Absolute Entertainment, together with sister companyImagineering Inc., is the largest U.S.-owned developer ofNintendo video games. Since entering the Nintendo developmentbusiness in 1988, we have not had any project stopped,questioned or rejected by Nintendo because it has notconformed to some mysterious standards established by themythical &quot;Nintendo censor.&quot; Overwhelmingly, Nintendo'sanalysis of our work is in the form of technical review andprogram-bug hunting.   James Charne   Vice President   Legal and Business Affairs   Absolute Entertainment Inc.   Glen Rock, N.J.</TEXT></DOC>
