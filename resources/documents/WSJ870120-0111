The plant will be fueled by anthracite culm, a waste product of anthracite coal mining. The plant will produce a minimum of 40,000 kilowatts of electricity, which will be sold to Pennsylvania Power andamp; Light Co., adding $18 million to Foster Wheeler's annual revenue. Steam generated by the plant will be sold to heat a local greenhouse, the engineering concern said.    Construction is scheduled to be completed by early 1989.    Cogeneration facilities simultaneously produce electricity and steam heat from a single fuel source, such as natural gas or biomass. They are generally considered a more efficient source of power than usual utility generating stations, and many nonutilities have recently built or have said they are planning to build cogeneration plants.
