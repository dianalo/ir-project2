Miller, chairmanof EMA and president of Rapport Communications in Palo Alto, Calif.andP;  &quot;Thesooner X.400 becomes a commodity and when it's not something special, that'swhen its value will be shown.&quot;andM;Bridges coming for Mac networks.andP;  At the moment, X.400 messaging is a realityfor many Macintosh users with stand-alone systems and modems who subscribe toservices that offer interconnections such as MCI Mail or Telenet Telemail.andO;But a vast majority of E-mail users are part of companywide LANs for whichX.400 bridges have not yet been released.andP;  But this, too, is changing.andM;X.400 bridges for large installations of Microsoft Mail and CE Software'sQuickMail announced last year by Touch Communication Inc. of Campbell,Calif., are scheduled for shipment this month.andP;  Santa Clara, Calif.-based3Com Corp. also plans to start shipping an X.400 version of its 3+Open forMacintosh this summer.andP;  It offers X.400 compatibility on small LANs for up to10 users.andP;  A third offering comes from Retix of Santa Monica, Calif.andP;  ItsRetixMail for the Macintosh runs on LANs that support common file servers forthe Mac and IBM PCs and compatibles.andP;  Retix is also developing an X.400gateway for TOPS Corp.'s InBox Plus.andM;Mark Bonaverra, a systems support specialist for a military contractor in theSouthwest, said RetixMail, though still in beta testing, is a &quot;fairly matureproduct.&quot;andM;It has a full set of features for internal and outside E-mail incorporated ina &quot;fairly straightforward user interface.andP;  Most people who have used it sayit is easy to understand,&quot; Bonaverra said.andM;Beyond text.andP;  X.400 provides a full set of features that include thecapability to send multipart messages made up of text, data, voice and images-- in short, anything that can be converted into binary code.andP;  The standardprovides a high level of delivery reliability.andP;  If there is a line failure,X.400 protocols automatically retransmit and reroute messages.andP;  E-mail canalso be delivered by fax or telex, enclosed in an X.400 &quot;envelope.&quot;andM;There is also increasing interest in X.400's EDI (electronic datainterchange) capabilities.andP;  In effect, EDI provides speedier transfer of databetween two or more sites that share similar or identical business forms.andO;EDI allows users to send the contents of the forms without sending the formsthemselves, Miller said.andM;One important E-mail communications standard still under development isX.500.andP;  Scheduled for completion in 1992, it will be designed to allow usersto locate other users and find files and data on remote networks.andP;  No X.500products are as yet commercially available.andM;Telecommunications executives believe 1990 will be the year when majornetworks of users rapidly accelerate the process of interconnection.andP;  KennethMurphy, product manager of enterprise messaging for GE Information Systems,says there are about 30 major network service providers worldwide.andP;  Inaddition to nine or so in the United States, he counts at least two in everyWestern European country, plus others in Canada, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, thePhilippines, Australia, New Zealand and Brazil.andM;&quot;I see [X.400 messaging] as a global phenomenon,&quot; Murphy said.andP;  &quot;Business isnot done in the United States only, so I'm looking at global markets.&quot;andM;Government sets the pace.andP;  Two major but little-noticed events have beendriving the accelerating adoption of X.400 by major North American serviceproviders.andP;  One involved a decision by the U.S.andP;  government to push a commoncommunications standard called GOSIP (Government Open Systems InterconnectionProfile).andP;  That, in turn, led the Aerospace Industries Association, whose 51member companies include most major Pentagon contractors, to throw itsconsiderable weight behind the X.400 standard.andM;The advantages for the companies are immediately apparent.andP;  An AIA surveyrevealed that its member firms have about 600,000 electronic mailboxes indaily use.andP;  Before the interconnect, individual corporations were forced tosubscribe to several service providers to send electronic messages to outsidebusiness partners and subcontractors.andM;When the interconnect is completed, each company will theoretically need onlyone service provider.andP;  At the same time, the X.400 standard will allow usersto design a single addressing format and a common interface for all E-mail,regardless if it is to be sent within a workgroup or across the country,noted EMA's+ Cavanagh.andM;With X.400 in place, reaching out to touch someone takes on a new dimensionand new power.andP;  n</TEXT></DOC>
