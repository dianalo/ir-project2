Moran ofinsider trading in the stock of Zondervan Corp., a company hehad once sought to acquire.   The suit filed in federal court in Manhattan alleges thatMr. Moran traded on inside information when he sold 100,000Zondervan shares on May 1, 1987. The suit alleged that Mr.Moran sold the shares shortly after being told confidentiallythat Zondervan, a publisher of religious materials, wasn'tmaking any progress in trying to find a suitor. It wasn'tuntil May 5 that the company announced publicly that it washaving trouble finding a purchaser.</LP><TEXT>   The SEC asked the federal court to order Mr. Moran to turnover his alleged illegal profit of $462,500 and to pay civilpenalties of as much as three times that amount. Mr. Moran'sattorney in London couldn't be reached for comment.   In 1986, Zondervan began looking for a buyer after a groupof investors led by Mr. Moran threatened to take over thecompany. The group held nearly a majority of the company'sstock. In the suit, the SEC said the inside information aboutthe company's inability to find a purchaser was told to Mr.Moran by Zondervan's financial adviser, Smith Barney, HarrisUpham andamp; Co. The SEC said Mr. Moran had signed aconfidentiality agreement with Smith Barney in October 1986regarding such information about Zondervan.   In May 1987, Mr. Moran announced that he had sold some ofhis Zondervan shares &quot;to satisfy requirements with respect toborrowings on such shares and other investments.&quot; At thattime, he said he had sold 363,300 Zondervan shares from May 1through May 6, leaving him with about 200,650 shares.   Zondervan, based in Grand Rapids, Mich., was acquired inSeptember 1988 by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
