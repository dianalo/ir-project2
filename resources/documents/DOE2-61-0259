These techniques included acceleratedmoisture addition, leachate recycle, buffer addition, nutrient addition,and combinations of these variables. Each test cell contained approximately380 kilograms of municipal solid waste and selected cells received quantitiesof buffer and nutrient compounds. All simulators were constructed inFebruary 1980 and monitoring continued for three years. After the thirdyear, selected cells were reloaded with sludge, nutrient, or buffer slurriesto further promote gas generation. Numerous physical and chemical parameterswere measured to determine gas-production rates and quality and leachatevolumes and composition. The report presents results from all five yearsof project operations. Results from the study indicate that sewage-sludgeadditions, buffer additions, and nutrient additions each appear to besuccessful enhancement techniques for gas production from municipal solidwaste.</TEXT></DOC>
