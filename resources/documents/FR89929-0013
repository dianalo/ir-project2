Formerly titled ``Demonstrations of Active Military Serviceand Discharge: Civilian or Contractual Personnel,'' it implemented PublicLaw 95-202 and established DoD policy and procedures to determine whetherthe civilian employment or contractual services of a civilian or contractualgroup shall be considered active military service for the purpose of lawsadministered by the Veterans Administration. A proposed revision of thisregulation was published in the January 30, 1989, <T4>Federal Register </T4>allowing for public comment through March 1,1989. That revision clarified the factors used by the DoD Civilian/MilitaryService Board and the Secretary of the Air Force (DoD executive agent forthis program) in making administrative determinations of active duty servicefor the purpose of VA benefits under Public Law 95-202. Changes and clarificationsstem from a Federal Court determination that the Department of Defensehad failed to clarify factors and criteria in their implementing directiveconcerning Public Law 95-202.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>September 11, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Lt Col K. Deutsch, Office of theAssistant Secretary of Defense (Force Management and Personnel), the Pentagon,Washington, DC 20301-4000, telephone (202) 697-7197.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>We received comments from seven individuals.Most commentors were representing a private organization or a federal agencyinvolved in some way with maritime matters. In several cases commentorsoffered substantially identical suggestions for changes. Some of thesesuggestions have been adopted, and some have not, as noted below. In additionto these substantive changes, some style and format changes have been introducedin order to comply more strictly with DoD 5025.1-M, chapter 2, and in responseto changes recommended during the course of DoD staff coordination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Major Comments</ITAG>PurposeOne commentor asked if an eligibility window existed for groups consideredunder Public Law 95-202. That is, would the law apply to future groupsand could someone ``intending to commemorate the service of group memberslong dead, say Spanish American War period, make a group application?''The law, as written, does not exclude consideration of future groups. However,since Public Law 95-202 provides recognition for the purposes of VeteransAdministration benefits, recognition for ``commemorative'' purposes wouldnot fall within the purview of the law because such benefits could notaccrue to any living person as a result of group recognition. In orderto clarify this point, this section is amended by changing the sentenceending ``* * * `active duty' ``to end as follows: ``* * * active militaryservice for the purposes of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits.''Additionally, paragraph D.1, <T3>Eligibility for Consideration, </T3>under the ``POLICY'' section isamended to add: ``(d) Consist of living persons to whom VA benefits canaccrue.''Definitions (Now Formatted as Enclosure 1 to the Directive)One commentor suggested that the language ``* * * which was then consideredcivilian employment with the Armed Forces or the result of a contract withthe U.S. Government'' introduces limitations not suggested by statute.The commentor felt that the statute allowed for civilian employment orcontractual service of any sort if it otherwise meets delineated criteria.However, we disagree and feel the statute intends that the service in questionmust have been performed as stated in the directive. For this reason, wedid not accept the recommended change.Another commentor suggested that since this revision is due to litigationthat surrounded the recognition of an oceangoing merchant marine group,we should cite that merchant marine group as a model against which futureapplications may be considered ``similarly situated.'' However, the statutealready uses the Women's Airforces Service Pilots (WASPs) as this modelgroup and we feel the addition of a second model in this directive wouldserve no purpose. For this reason we did not accept this recommendation.ResponsibilitiesOne commentor objected to the use of the language ``* * * service for thepurpose of Veterans Administration benefits * * *'' as used in this paragraph.The commenter contends that this language does not equate to the languageof the law which reads ``* * * active duty for the purposes of all lawsadministered by the Veterans Administration * * *.'' However, the languagein this paragraph is deemed necessary to preclude members recognized underthe provisions of Public Law 95-202 from receiving Civil Service, military,and other benefits that were not envisioned by Congress when they passedthis section of the law. The General Counsel of the Office of PersonnelManagement has reaffirmed that those recognized under Public Law 95-202are not entitled to Civil Service benefits. The language chosen for thisparagraph is clearer to the lay person who may not be familiar with whatlaws the Veterans Administration actually administers. Finally, Counselhas confirmed that this wording means the same as that in the law. Forthese reasons, we did not accept this recommended change.PolicyOne commenter felt the entire ``Policy'' section should be reorganizedto differentiate between groups that served in combat areas and groupsthat did not. Groups which served in combat areas would be tested against``the rather precise criteria of international law and in the same mannerthat they would be viewed by the enemy.'' Remaining groups would be testedagainst ``criteria more attuned to garrison duty or recruit training.''Such a ``dichotomous approach'' would eliminate a requirement for consideringfactors for both types of groups which are significant to only one or theother, the commentor offered. Another commentor made a similar suggestionby proposing a subsection instructing the C/MSRB to take cognizance ofthe effect, if any, that international law in effect at the time of thegroup's service could have had on the group. While we don't feel a totalrestructuring of the policy section is necessary, we did concur with thislatter suggestion and, as a result, amend paragraph D.2 to add: ``c. <T3>Status of the Group in International Law. </T3>In addition to otherfactors, consideration will be given to whether members of the group wereregarded and treated as civilians, or assimilated to the armed forces,as reflected in treaties, customary international law, judicial decisionsand U.S. diplomatic practice.''Another commentor felt that the limitation of ``under control of U.S. ArmedForces'' should be deleted because the statute does not state that theemployer must have been the U.S. Federal Government. However, we feel thestatute intends that the service in question must have been as the resultof civilian employment or contractual capacity with the U.S. Federal Governmentand performed under the control of the U.S. Armed Forces. For this reasonwe did not accept this recommended change.Policy: Paragraph D.2.a.(1)(a)All commentors felt that the wording of this paragraph might unfairly eliminategroups which might otherwise be appropriate candidates for recognition.The commentors' objections here are due to a matter of semantics. Whendrafted, the words ``created or organized'' we intended to include groupswho existed prior to the period of service in question but were reorganizeddue to a wartime need. Therefore, we accept one commentor's suggestionto change this paragraph to read: ``(a) The group was created or organizedby U.S. government authorities to fill a wartime need or, if a group wasnot created specifically for a wartime need, but existed before that time,then its wartime mission was of a nature to substantially alter the organization'sprewar character.''Policy: Paragraph D.2.a(2)A typographical error is contained in the last sentence of this paragraphin the words ``* * *, and the staffing requirements shall include the lengthof employment and pay grades of the members of this group.'' This shouldhave read ``* * *, and the staffing requirements to include the lengthof employment and pay grades of the members of the group.''Possibly due to this typographical error, two commentors felt that thisparagraph, as worded, was intended to disqualify a civilian group whichreceived a pay raise or bonus as a result of service during a period ofarmed conflict. However, that is not the case. When printed without error,the paragraph means that if a military command authority affected the payscale of civilian employees during a period of armed conflict, then suchaction would tend to favor the group's chances of recognition since militarycontrol over the group is illustrated.Additionally, another commentor pointed out that competent authoritiesother than the military command might affect length of employment and paygrade requirements. As a result, in addition to correcting the typographicalerror described above, we will amend this paragraph to begin: ``The conceptof military control is reinforced if the military command authority determinessuch things as the structure * * *''Policy Paragraph D.2.a.(3)Two commentors felt that examples of military integration contained inthis section were either inconclusive or irrelevant. If judged alone, wemight agree. However, integration into the military organization is onlyone criterion and would not be judged without context. That is, whetheror not a group could satisfy the criteria of integration via the publishedexamples would not automatically qualify the group for, nor disqualifythe group from, recognition on the whole. For these reasons, we did notaccept a recommendation to alter this section.Policy Paragraph D.2.a.(5)Two commentors felt that a distinction should be made between ``personsserving with'' and those ``accompanying'' an Armed Force in the field.The commentors' rationale was that historically only those ``serving with''an Armed Force were, in practice, subject to military justice and otherforms of military control. We concur and amend the third sentence of thissection to begin as follows: ``Those who were serving with the U.S. ArmedForces may have been treated * * *''Another commentor felt that criteria in the statute which were omittedin the draft directive should be reinstated. Two of the criteria (``receivedmilitary training'' and ``acquired military capability'') were omittedbecause they had not been historically useful when considering group applications.A third criteria (``performance critical to the success of the militarymission'') was omitted because we felt that, applied literally, it couldunfairly limit recognition to those groups which participated in successfuloperations. We felt that the character of the participation should be judgedrather than the success of the mission. Nevertheless, we did not intendto prevent the submission of evidence relevant to these criteria if thatevidence supports the group's overall application. For these reasons SectionD.2 is amended to add ``a.(7) Receipt of Military Training and/or Achievementof <T3>Military Capability. </T3>If a group employed skills or resources thatwere enhanced as the result of military training, or equipment designedor issued for that purpose, this acts toward recognition.'' We will not,however, reinstate the criteria of ``performance critical to the successof a military mission'' because it is unfairly restrictive for applicantgroups.Policy Paragraph D.2.b(1)Two commentors suggested that this section does not offer ``explicit guidance''to the extent needed by the board. One commentor offered that a definitionof ``defensive'' should be incorporated into the directive. The commentoroffered examples to illustrate that whether or not a weapon is ``defensive''or ``offensive'' is determined by the context in which the weapon is used.Since we agree with the commentor that individual circumstances will probablydetermine whether weapons are considered offensive or defensive, we feelthat such determinations are better left to the Civilian/Military ServiceReview Board and the Secretary of the Air Force when considering the particularcircumstances of a particular group. For this reason, we did not acceptthe recommendation to create an all-encompassing definition of ``defensive.''However, on the basis of comments from international law experts we arechanging this paragraph to begin <T3>``Submission to the U.S. Armed Forces for protection. </T3>A groupthat seeks protection and assistance from the U.S. Armed Forces and submits* * *.''Policy Paragraph D.2.a.(6)As one commentor pointed out, the language is this section contains anerror. The last two sentences of this section should have been deleted.Nevertheless, the commentor's suggestions are incorporated as a more comprehensivestandard. Therefore, this paragraph is changed to read: ``(6) <T3>Prohibition against Members of the Group Joining the Armed Forces.</T3>Some organizations may have been formed to serve in a military capacityto overcome the operation of existing laws or Treaty or because of a governmentallyestablished policy to retain individuals in the group as part of a civilianforce. These factors act in favor of recognition.''Policy Paragraph D.2.b.(3)All commentors interpreted this paragraph to mean that the C/MSRB and theSecretary of the Air Force cannot consider precedent when evaluating agroup for recognition. However, that was never the intent. This paragraphis intended to explain that civilian groups which have already been compensatedby the Federal government for the service in question are ineligible toapply under Public Law 95-202. To clarify this point, this paragraph isamended to read: ``Recognition of a group's service by agencies of stateor local government * * *.'' Subsequently, Section D.1 is amended to add:``e. Not have already received benefits from the Federal government forthe service in question.''Policy Paragraph D.1.bTwo commentors felt that the wording ``civilian employment with the ArmedForces, or the result of a contract with the U.S. Government to providedirect support to the Armed Forces,'' incomplete as it might omit civiliangroups who were brought under direct employment with the Armed Forces underother circumstances. We accepted one commentor's recommended language andamended the paragraph to read as follows: ``b. Have rendered service tothe United States in what was then considered civilian employment withthe U.S. Armed Forces, either through formal civil service hiring, or lessformal hiring if the engagement was created under the exigencies of war;or as the result of a contract with the United States Government to providedirect support to the U.S. Armed Forces.''DoD C/MSRB and Advisory Panel (Now enclosure 4 to the directive) ParagraphB.3.b:One commentor felt this paragraph allowed the Board to ignore any and allrelevant precedent. As a matter of clarification, the beginning of thisparagraph is amended to read: ``Prior group determinations made under theprovisions of Public Law 95-202 do not bind * * *''<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 47</ITAG>Military personnel.Accordingly, 32 CFR part 47 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 47_ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE FOR CIVILIAN OR CONTRACTUAL GROUPS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">47.1 Purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">47.2 Applicability and scope.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">47.3 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">47.4 Policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">47.5 Responsibilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">47.6 Procedures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Appendix A to Part 47_Instructions for Submitting Group ApplicationsUnder Public Law 95-202.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Appendix B to Part 47_The DoD Civilian/Military Service Review Boardand the Advisory Panel</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>38 U.S.C. 106 note.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 47.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose.</ITAG>This document:(a) Revises 32 CFR part 47 and implements Public Law 95-202.(b) Directs the Secretary of the Air Force to determine if an establishedgroup of civilian employees or contract workers provided service to theU.S. Armed Forces in a manner considered active military service for Departmentof Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits.(c) Establishes the DoD Civilian/Military Service Review Board and theAdvisory Panel.(d) Establishes policy, assigns responsibilities, prescribes applicationprocedures for groups and individuals, and clarifies the factors used todetermine active duty (AD) service.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 47.2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Applicability and scope.</ITAG>This part:(a) Applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the MilitaryDepartments, and by agreement with the Department of Transportation (DoT),the U.S. Coast Guard.(b) Applies to any group application considered under Public Law 95-202after September 11, 1989 and to any individual who applies for dischargedocuments as a member of a group recognized by the Secretary of the AirForce.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 47.3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG><T3>Armed conflict. </T3>A prolonged period of sustained combat involvingmembers of the U.S. Armed Forces against a foreign belligerent.

The extent of control exerted overthe group must be similar to that exerted over military personnel and shallbe determined by, but not necessarily limited to, the following:(1) <T3>Incidents favoring equivalency_</T3>(i) <T3>Uniqueness of service. </T3>Civilian service (civilian employment orcontractual service) is a vital element of the war-fighting capabilityof the Armed Forces. Civilian service during a period of armed conflictis not necessarily equivalent to active military service, even when performedin a combat zone. Service must be beyond that generally performed by civilianemployees and must be occasioned by unique circumstances. For civilianservice to be recognized under this part, the following factors must bepresent:(A) The group was created or organized by U.S. Government authorities tofill a wartime need or, if a group was not created specifically for a wartimeneed, but existed before that time, then its wartime mission was of a natureto substantially alter the organization's prewar character.(B) If the application is based on service in a combat zone, the missionof the group in a combat zone must have been substantially different fromthe mission of similar groups not in a combat zone.(ii) <T3>Organizational authority over the group. </T3>The concept of militarycontrol is reinforced if the military command authority determines suchthings as the structure of the civilian organization, the location of thegroup, the mission and activities of the group, and the staffing requirementsto include the length of employment and pay grades of the members of thegroup.(iii) <T3>Integration into the military organization. </T3>Integrated civiliangroups are subject to the regulations, standards, and control of the militarycommand authority.(A) Examples include the following:(<T3>1</T3>) Exchanging military courtesies.(<T3>2</T3>) Wearing military clothing, insignia, and devices.(<T3>3</T3>) Assimilating the group into the military organizational structure.(<T3>4</T3>) Emoluments associated with military personnel; i.e., the useof commissaries and exchanges, and membership in military clubs.(B) A group fully integrated into the military would give the impressionthat the members of the group were military, except that they were paidand accounted for as civilians.(C) Integration into the military may lead to an expectation by membersof the group that the service of the group imminently would be recognizedas active military service. Such integration acts in favor of recognition.(iv) <T3>Subjection to military discipline. </T3>During past armed conflicts,U.S. military commanders sometimes restricted the rights or liberties ofcivilian members as if they were military members.(A) Examples include the following:(<T3>1</T3>) Placing members under a curfew.(<T3>2</T3>) Requiring members to work extended hours or unusual shifts.(<T3>3</T3>) Changing duty assignments and responsibilities.(<T3>4</T3>) Restricting proximity travel to and from the military installation.(<T3>5</T3>) Imposing dress and grooming standards.(B) Consequences for noncompliance might include a loss of some privilege,dismissal from the group, or trial under military law. Such military disciplineacts in favor of recognition.(v) <T3>Subjection to military justice. </T3>Military members are subject tothe military criminal justice system. During times of war, ``persons servingwith or accompanying an Armed Force in the field'' are subject to the militarycriminal justice code. Those who were serving with the U.S. Armed Forcesmay have been treated as if they were military and subjected to court-martialjurisdiction to maintain discipline. Such treatment is a factor in favorof recognition.(vi) <T3>Prohibition against members of the group joining the armed forces.</T3>Some organizations may have been formed to serve in a military capacityto overcome the operation of existing laws or treaty or because of a governmentallyestablished policy to retain individuals in the group as part of a civilianforce. These factors act in favor of recognition.(vii) <T3>Receipt of military training and/or achievement of military capability.</T3>If a group employed skills or resources that were enhanced as theresult of military training or equipment designed or issued for that purpose,this acts toward recognition.(2) <T3>Incidents not favoring equivalency_</T3>(i) <T3>Submission to the U.S. Armed Forces for protection. </T3>A group thatseeks protection and assistance from the U.S. Armed Forces and submitsto military control for its own well-being is not deemed to have providedservice to the Armed Forces equivalent to AD military service, even thoughthe group may have been as follows:(A) Armed by the U.S. military for defensive purposes.(B) Routed by the U.S. military to avoid the enemy.(C) Instructed by the U.S. military for the defense of the group when attackedby, or in danger of attack by, the enemy.(D) Otherwise submitted themselves to the U.S. military for sustenanceand protection.(ii) <T3>Permitted to resign. </T3>The ability of members to resign at willand without penalty acts against military control. Penalty may be directand severe, such as confinement, or indirect and moderate, such as difficultand costly transportation from an overseas location.(iii) <T3>Prior recognition of group service. </T3>Recognition of a group's serviceby agencies of State or local government does not provide support in favorof recognition under this part.(3) <T3>Status of group in international law. </T3>In addition to other factors,consideration will be given to whether members of the group were regardedand treated as civilians, or assimilated to the Armed Forces as reflectedin treaties, customary international law, judicial decisions, and U.S.diplomatic practice.(c) <T3>Reconsideration. </T3>Applications by groups previously denied a favorabledetermination by the Secretary of the Air Force shall be reconsidered underthis part if the group submits evidence that is new, relevant, and substantive.Any request that the DoD Civilian/Military Service Review Board establishedhereunder (see andSection; 47.5(b)) determines does not provide new, relevant,and substantive evidence shall be returned to the applicant with the reasonsfor nonacceptance.(d) <T3>Counsel Representation. </T3>Neither the Department of Defense norDepartment of Transportation shall provide representation by counsel ordefray the cost of such representation with respect to any matter coveredby this part.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 47.5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Responsibilities.</ITAG>(a) The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force Management and Personnel)(ASD(FMandamp;P)) shall:(1) Appoint a primary and an alternate member in the grade of O-6 or GM-15or higher to the DoD Civilian/Military Service Review Board.(2) Exercise oversight over the Military Departments and the U.S. CoastGuard for compliance with this Directive and in the issuance of dischargedocuments and casualty reports to members of recognized groups.(b) The Secretary of the Air Force, as the designated Executive Agent ofthe Secretary of Defense for the administration of Public Law 95-202 shall:(2) Establish the DoD Civilian/Military Service Review Board and the AdvisoryPanel.(2) Appoint as board president a member or employee of the Air Force ingrade O-6 or GM-15 or higher.(3) Request the Secretary of Transportation to appoint an additional votingmember from the U.S. Coast Guard when the board is considering the applicationof a group claiming active Coast Guard service.(4) Provide a recorder and an assistant to maintain the records of theboard and administer the functions of this part.(5) Provide nonvoting legal advisors and historians.(6) Publish notices of group applications and other Public Law 95-202 announcementsin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.(7) Consider the rationale and recommendations of the DoD Civilian/MilitaryService Review Board.(8) Determine whether the service rendered by a civilian or contractualgroup shall be considered AD service to the U.S. Armed Forces for all lawsadministered by the VA.
