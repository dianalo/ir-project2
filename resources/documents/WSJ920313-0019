Clark Jr. makes the excellent point thateconomic growth in Mexico stimulated by the North AmericanFree Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would create the wealthnecessary to purchase environmental protection (&quot;ProsperityCould Curb Mexico's Pollution,&quot; Speaking of Business,editorial page, Feb. 12). However, we should also be awarethat entrusting the environment solely to the politicalprocess could upset the balance of economic and ecologicalconsiderations.   Success in politics is determined by how many laws andregulations are passed, not by what is best for the ecology.Environmental interest groups and the media tend toexaggerate public-health concerns in order to build momentumfor an agenda. The resulting flawed-risk analysis hasproduced devastating consequences for at least one otherLatin American country. The scientific journal Naturerecently reported that environmental officials in Perudecided not to chlorinate that nation's drinking waterbecause of warnings by the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency that chlorine poses a slight cancer risk. As a result,more than 300,000 cases of cholera have been linked tocontaminated Peruvian drinking water.</LP><TEXT>   Certain exempted businesses in the U.S. often reapbenefits from regulations that hinder their competitors. Suchproblems would be magnified in a country like Mexico, wherebureaucrats are not as insulated against bribery andcorruption. Worse, ill-conceived environmental laws andregulations would penalize foreign investment stimulated bythe NAFTA, and could be used as a surrogate for tradeprotectionism. We should hope that Mexican prosperity doesnot result in heightened calls for political management ofthe environment.   James M.
