 A survey of the operations at Ashton-Tate andinterviews with key members of the firm's dBASE productdevelopment and support team reveals that the company isattempting to reassert the market primacy of dBASE and improve thefirm's somewhat damaged image with developers and consumers.andP;

 Wayne Ratliff sired it, George Tate and Hal Lashlee nurtured it,and many have benefited ever since.andP;  But what started out as a personalcomputing breakthrough has evolved into the target of a war for survival.andO;Database challengers are coming from every direction to contest dBASE'sdominant position.andP;  It may be a war only a firm with A-T's resources canwithstand.andP;  They intend to defend the dBASE world by expanding it.andP;  Theirstrategy is to provide a way to run dBASE applications on almost every typeof important business computer.andP;  If they succeed dBASE developers and usersare promised substantial benefits...andP;  for years to come.andP;  But success willrequire more than promises.andP;  Is A-T good enough to be the database champion?andM;BackgroundandM;How you see Ashton-Tate is probably related to when you entered the dBASEworld.andP;  When I got my eight-inch floppy CP/M version of dBASE II back in1982, the microcomputer world was in its infancy.andP;  We were all pioneers, andwe knew it.andP;  dBASE II had plenty of rough edges, but so what?andP;  It let anyreasonably intelligent person with a logical mind, spare time, andperseverance construct complex business applications.andP;  We were hooked.andP;  A-Twas as green as we were, but that was okay; we were all in this together.andM;1984's dBASE III marked a transition.andP;  A-T had ambitions far beyond selling alean, mean development machine.andP;  We knew so because Framework was released tochallenge mighty Lotus' newest product, Symphony!andP;  Dealing with A-T became amore formal affair.andM;As the company grew, technical support people struggled to keep up with anexpanding number of sophisticated users.andM;The dBASE III Developer's Release, a &quot;secret&quot; 1985 version for those in theknow, suggested that A-T knew developers were the key to dBASE success.andP;  Itpushed out the boundaries of the language, giving application developers morepowerful programming tools.andM;1986's dBASE III PLUS, a more polished version of Developer's Release, mostlyadded features for the novice user, plus an unsatisfactory approach tonetwork support.andP;  dBASE &quot;LanPacks&quot; were expensive, performance was slow, andentire files were locked unnecessarily.andP;  Experienced dBASEers had no need forthe Assist menu system, Views and Catalogs.andP;  What we needed was speed, and asmore of us made a living selling applications, we needed a compiler.andO;Fortunately, a new firm called Nantucket offered Clipper, the product we hadbeen expecting from A-T for years.andP;  Clipper had the same rough edges as dBASEII, and the company was difficult to deal with, but we didn't care.andP;  We had afaster, more flexible alternative to dBASE.andP;  Other dBASE language compatibleproducts like dBCompiler (now Quicksilver) expanded our choices.andP;  One,FoxBASE, offered almost total compatibility, a dot prompt mode, a form ofcompilation, and incredible speed.andM;It eventually became obvious to A-T that dBASE III PLUS was not the mostsophisticated dBASE-type product on the market.andP;  So dBASE IV was announced,described, and promised to have features useful to both novices and pros.andP;  Itwas even rumored to be superior to FoxBASE+ and Clipper.andP;  End users jumpedfor joy.andP;  Developers, who had moved on to more productive pastures, were moreskeptical.andP;  But most of us hoped A-T would once again extend the boundariesof the dBASE world.andP;  Did it matter who took the lead?andP;  Nantucket wasn'tespecially lovable, and Fox wasn't well known, so A-T was as good a marketleader as any.andP;  Whoever had the best product should deserve and receive theloyalty of dBASE developers.andP;  All A-T had to do was deliver on theirpromises.andP;  With more people and more money than all the other firms combined,they should be able to do it.andM;One question remained.andP;  Would A-T show improved understanding, respect andsupport for developers--people who used dBASE to write programs for their ownand other firms?andP;  In contrast to recent years, A-T actually answered thisquestion.andP;  &quot;Yes--we know what you need, and you will get it!&quot; was theproclamation to an audience of over 1,000 at the September 1988 Ashton-Tatedevelopers conference.andP;  &quot;We have learned the error of our ways!&quot;andM;At the end of October 1988, dBASE IV appeared.andP;  Was it competitive withFoxBASE+ and Clipper?andP;  It had advanced features, true.andP;  But performance andreliability were inadequate.andP;  Fox Software laughed the loudest, announcingthey would soon provide a superior alternative--not dBASE IV, but compatiblewith it.andP;  (The product, FoxPro, hasn't been released yet).andP;  A-T reacted byslapping Fox with a lawsuit claiming exclusive ownership of the dBASE essencewithin FoxBASE+.andP;  Fox responded with a counter suit charging that A-T ownsless, not more of dBASE.andP;  The thought of losing FoxBASE+ and the rest of thedBASE-compatible products, with no reasonable alternative available from A-T,sent developers and sophisticated users into panic.andP;  &quot;Kill the compatiblesand you kill us, the people who made dBASE what it is today!&quot; was the cry.andO;Some believe the vitality and even survival of the entire dBASE developmentindustry may be riding on the outcome of the Ashton-Tate/Fox Software battle.andO;Compete by building a better product, many people urge.andM;What's the problem?andP;  It's almost as if an inverse relationship exists betweensize and capability.andP;  The bigger A-T has become, the less it has been able tosatisfy the dBASE world.andP;  At least, that's how it appears to many outsiders.andM;It was against this background that Editor-In-Chief David Kalman and Idecided to perform a reality check.andP;  Converging on Ashton-Tate corporateheadquarters in Torrance, Calif., Dave and I spent a day meeting with keymembers of the A-T dBASE team.andP;  Our goal was to cut through the rumors andemotions and understand the true nature of A-T's role in the database world.andM;Do you know the way to SouthandM;L.A.?andM;Getting to Ashton-Tate headquarters is easy.andP;  It's located in Torrance, atthe convergence of two freeways, smack in the middle of the continuous jumbleof suburban industrial cities that extends through southwest Los AngelesCounty from Hollywood to Long Beach.andP;  Torrance is 17 miles south of BeverlyHills, 22 miles west of Disneyland, and five miles east of Redondo Beach andthe Pacific Ocean.andM;Torrance is headquarters, but A-T is a worldwide operation.andP;  Manufacturingplants are located in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico.andP;  Softwaredevelopment is California-based.andP;  Back when Ashton-Tate was in Culver City,the programming staff lobbied to get away from distractions andinterruptions.andP;  Glendale, closer to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, whereWayne Ratliff created &quot;Vulcan&quot; (the original dBASE), was convenient for manyof the early dBASE team.andP;  Much of the dBASE work continues to be done at this&quot;Home of dBASE,&quot; the Glendale Development Center, 20 miles north of Torrance.andO;Development of Framework, plus the other PC and Macintosh products (includingMultiMate, FullWrite, dBASE Mac, and Full Impact) has been consolidated in anew site 400 miles north at Los Gatos, in the San Francisco Bay Area'sSilicon Valley.andP;  Some structured query language (SQL) and database enginework is done by a team in Walnut Creek, 25 miles east of San Francisco.andO;Developers at Torrance handle many of the database interface issues.andP;  Sincepeople can't depend on just bumping into each other in the hall, it takes aconscious effort to maintain internal communications.andP;  Managing such afar-flung development team requires lots of telecommunications and lots oftravel.andM;Geography aside, Ashton-Tate is a large company, built on an estimatedinstalled base of two million copies of dBASE.andP;  In spite of its problems,300,000 copies of dBASE IV have been sold into distribution channels, 100,000as upgrades.andP;  A-T says this is more than IBM and Oracle did in the prior nineyears.andP;  But A-T is more than dBASE; they have over 20 other software productson the market.andP;  The Tate Publishing Group independently markets books anddeveloper software, such as the new dBASE File Recovery utility.andP;  Over 1,400employees helped achieve sales of $310 million worldwide last year.andP;  Compoundannual growth has exceeded 40 percent over the past five years.andP;  (However,the company just announced that it expected to post a $15 million loss forthe quarter that ended June 30.andP;  A large part of this loss, according tofinancial analysts, is due to slow product sales.)andP;  Roughly 350 people areemployed in development across all A-T products.andP;  The majority seem to beinvolved with dBASE IV.andM;As a working environment, A-T's Torrance headquarters is an oasis by thefreeway.andP;  A modern donut-shaped building surrounds a large central courtyardwith trees and tables--a place to have lunch outdoors yet sheltered.andP;  There'sa cafeteria in the building, although a conference room in the tech supportarea was spread with pizza on the Friday we visited.andP;  The imposingthree-story glass-walled A-T building is hard to miss from the outside, andeven harder to get inside.andP;  A no-nonsense, walkie-talkie-equipped, uniformedPinkerton guard controls the lobby and all that lies beyond.andP;  Even toemployees, parts of the building housing new product development are behindlocked security doors, accessible only with special authorization.andM;Outfitted with bright red badges proclaiming &quot;VISITOR--Must Have Escort,&quot;Dave and I were led inside Ashton-Tate.andM;Getting to know youandM;Our meeting started with apologies.andP;  Ashton-Tate is sorry that dBASE IV wasreleased before it was ready.andP;  A-T is sorry the dBASE Professional Compileris not on schedule.andP;  They are sorry that Ashton-Tate and the developercommunity don't understand each other.andP;  And A-T promises to fix everythingReal Soon Now.andM;While there was some defensiveness about dBASE IV, most of the people wetalked with were quick to acknowledge that version 1.0 is an incompleteproduct that should not have been released last October.andP;  How did it happen?andO;According to James Neiser, Director of Workstation Database Products, &quot;Wejust threw it over the wall.&quot;andP;  A-T was surprised at the reaction.andP;  &quot;We didn'tget the kind of feedback needed,&quot; Neiser says.andP;  &quot;We did a technical betadebug, but failed to anticipate the 'how used' reaction.andP;  On the inside, alllooks good, but on the outside people don't see it.&quot;andP;  (Data Based Advisor hasbeen told by major beta testers that they never saw the final version beforerelease.andP;  What they got was a total surprise.)andP;  Conceding that lots of peoplewere surprised at 1.0, Neiser says it shouldn't have happened.andP;  &quot;Ashton-Tateshould have kept people apprised of what would happen.andP;  Communications--thefeedback loop--was missing.&quot;andP;  Even though A-T had teams building a widevariety of test applications, they didn't discover the full range ofapplications dBASE gets used for until complaints started to roll in frombuyers of the released product.andP;  About another complaint--that multi-featureddBASE IV 1.0 feels like a collection of modules rather than a seamlessprogram--Neiser responds that &quot;possibly at the component level, someintegration didn't happen across teams.&quot;andM;dBASE IV is full of features because it must fit so many different types ofsituations.andP;  Neiser calls dBASE IV Ashton-Tate's response to a diverse groupof needs.andP;  Users are looking for greater productivity.andP;  Corporations want toleverage their investment in use of products to other environments.andP;  A-Tintends to have a product for every level of user.andP;  Claiming &quot;No otherproduct on the market can do the same,&quot; he describes dBASE IV as providingease of use, functionality, performance, interactive data management, abetter applications development environment, and a more object-like approach(he made no claim to it bein object-oriented).andM;A big question produced a surprising response.andP;  Does A-T consider 1.0 to be ausable product?andP;  Neiser said, &quot;Yes.&quot;andP;  So why haven't SBT and Sourcematereleased the dBASE IV-specific versions of their accounting softwareoriginally announced for concurrent shipment?andP;  Isn't their hesitation proofthat dBASE IV is lacking in a fundamental way?andP;  &quot;I didn't know they had aproblem,&quot; Neiser replied.andM;But they do--a serious problem.andP;  Accounting applications designed for dBASEIV almost a year ago still cannot be released.andP;  Sourcemate president Ben Tseis frustrated.andP;  &quot;Without the Professional Compiler we cannot recommendrunning AccountMate on dBASE IV.andP;  Performance is not up to the standard weneed.andP;  It is difficult to comprehend why a company with so many resourcescannot get a product out sooner.&quot;andP;  SBT president Bob Davies says, &quot;Thecurrently released dBASE IV product does not provide adequate performance tomeet the needs of our customers.andP;  We are eagerly awaiting the release of aversion that does.&quot;andP;  Both firms continue to ship products that use only dBASEIII PLUS capabilities.andM;Even after dBASE IV is fixed, Neiser says dBASE III PLUS will have a place.andO;Its lower memory and disk drive requirements are ideal for people with lesserneeds.andP;  Another product, A-T's RapidFile, is designed as a query tool, witheven lower functionality but high ease of use.andP;  The next RapidFile release(late this year) will directly use DBF files (a serious omission in thecurrent version), but it will not support SQL Server (yet).andP;  A-T also haspeople working on strategies and concepts for the next five years, includingprototyping interface work on graphics environment products.andM;dBASE IV 1.1andM;Whatever the actual problems with version 1.0, both Neiser and Joseph Budge,Product Manager of Database Products, believe that the next release will fixthem.andP;  Will it be reliable?andP;  Neiser states emphatically that A-T will notship 1.1 until it is absolutely ready.andP;  You may recall that this is the samestatement made by the company about dBASE IV 1.0.andP;  Regarding their history ofmaking and breaking promises, Neiser says the past is past.andP;  Futurecredibility will come by letting customers and the market tell A-T how wellthey've done.andM;What will dBASE IV release 1.1 do differently?andP;  Mostly, run better.andP;  Aspreviously planned, SQL Server support will be included.andP;  The requirementthat SQL and dBASE language statements be separated will remain.andP;  Somelanguage features are expected to be added, including a KEYBOARD command tostuff the keyboard, conditional indexing with INDEX FOR andless;conditionandgt;, cursorcontrol with SET CURSOR ON/OFF, message line control with SET MESSAGE TOandless;expandgt;, and REPLACE FROM ARRAY to move data from an array to a databaserecord.andP;  The balance of A-T's goals for 1.1 are maintenance-oriented.andP;  Bugswill be fixed, and various aspects like user defined functions (UDFs) willperform closer to what was originally intended.andP;  A new dynamic memorymanagement system will lower requirements.andP;  Memory management in version 1.0was a major problem.andP;  In 1.1 the user will be able to trade off memoryrequirements and performance.andP;  Giving it more working RAM will increasespeed.andM;Overall, look for only a small improvement in performance.andP;  Budge says A-Twill continue to increase it, but he suspects they &quot;will never be theleader.&quot;andP;  He adds that maximum speed is not the main goal, and a performancerace will always be lost to someone who emphasizes it.andP;  He feels that Fox andNantucket focus mainly on speed, and started on that road earlier.andP;  Budgesays A-T has to do more for more markets, and can't focus on just one aspectof the product.andM;There will be improvement in the handling of overlays and UDFs, but it willbe part of the memory/speed trade-off.andP;  A-T is changing how dBASE IVcomponents located in overlays are brought in and out of working memory, anarea of major performance problems in 1.0.andP;  About two-thirds of the UDFrestrictions will vanish.andP;  An early prerelease copy of version 1.1 supportedthe use of the macro (andamp;) operator in UDFs, as well as other previouslyunsupported commands such as APPEND.andP;  Some UDF restrictions will remainbecause of limits A-T feels are apparently unavoidable and because ofinherent logical restrictions on what a UDF can do.andP;  According to anAshton-Tate spokesperson, whether version 1.1 will support indexing on a UDFremains undecided.andM;The dBASE Professional Compiler, the invisible hit of last year's developers'conference, is still nowhere in sight.andP;  While assuring us that additionalpeople have been put on the project (which is principally assigned to ApexSoftware Corp. of Pittsburgh, Penn.), Neiser was unable to give any feel forwhen.andP;  Another A-T manager, perhaps as frustrated by the delay as we are,went so far as to use the &quot;if&quot; word.andM;Problems, problemsandM;Ashton-Tate is a large company with hundreds of talented, devoted people,superb facilities, and vast resources.andP;  Considering all they have going forthem, why didn't A-T do better with dBASE IV the first time around?andP;  Budgesays the task of integrating product components was underestimated.andP;  Heagrees that it's easy to second guess why dBASE IV wasn't done differently,but some aspects are pragmatic decisions.andP;  For example, some people complainabout how SQL is connected with the rest of the product; but if it wasn'tdone this way, Budge says, it wouldn't be there at all.andP;  &quot;Building individualcomponents wasn't too difficult, but getting them to all work together was ahuge challenge.andP;  The real problems are the hand-offs from one module to thenext, which means moving from one programmer to the next.&quot;andP;  Did some of thedevelopment delays stem from the large number of programmers assigned to theproject?andP;  Budge acknowledges that &quot;large teams were very difficult to manageand coordinate.andP;  Maybe we sh ould not have done it that way.andP;  With multipleprogrammers the complexity of the task goes up geometrically.andP;  But we arevery proud of what has been accomplished.&quot;andM;So why is it taking almost another year to produce version 1.1, originallyscheduled to follow 1.0 in less than six months?andP;  Budge says, &quot;Thedevelopment team is paying for some of the sins made in the architecture of1.0.&quot;andP;  Focused on integration of a wide array of new features and functions,they &quot;did not realize the extent to which memory and performance wereinterlinked problems in such a large product.&quot;andP;  As disappointed buyers havediscovered, 1.0 is locked into such extremely rigid memory management that ituses too much for many networks.andM;Will 1.1 be free of the bugs that drive dBASE developers crazy?andP;  A-T isadding additional test sites, applications, and sophistication to the testingprocess.andP;  The SQL features--particularly the dBASE IV-SQL Serverconnection--will be tested extensively.andP;  A-T especially wants to be sureapplications that issue SQL commands can be run smoothly with both the localengine and SQL Server.andM;Multi-platform strategyandM;It's no secret that A-T intends to spread dBASE across different systems,including micros, minis and mainframes.andP;  A-T hopes this strategy will opendoors deep into large corporations.andP;  What is surprising is how quickly theyhope to pop out the products needed to do so.andP;  A-T already offers Direct/36and Direct/38 dBASE connectivity products, which are being upgraded tosupport IBM's AS/400 line.andP;  Within a few months after dBASE IV 1.1 isreleased, A-T hopes to have dBASE versions for several other computers andoperating systems, although they're careful to make no promises.andP;  There is ageneral reluctance to discuss future products, lest they be labeledvaporware.andP;  Neiser will only say, &quot;Ashton-Tate is committed to compatibilityacross platforms.andP;  We will stay focused on the number of platforms that canbe implemented, released, and supported with total portability andcompatibility of data and code.&quot;andM;Can it be done?andP;  Budge says no to worry.andP;  The multi-system issue isrelatively simple compared to other development problems.andP;  He says, &quot;It ismuch trickier to get 3.5 megabytes of dBASE into 330 kilobytes of DOSworkspace than it is to get it running in the virtual memory environments oflarger systems.&quot;andM;Future dBASE IV platforms range from OS/2 to Presentation Manager (PM), PMExtended Edition, UNIX/XENIX, VMS and even another shot at the Macintosh.andO;The current dBASE/Mac, which is not really a Macintosh version of dBASE, isessentially a dead product.andP;  It will be completely rewritten to match dBASEIV, including native support of DBF files.andM;The first alternate version of dBASE IV to be available will run on the DECVAX.andP;  Ken Rhie, dBASE VMS Product Manager, let us try it running under theVMS operating system on a VAX 3600 minicomputer.andP;  It worked!andP;  Rhie says dBASEon a VAX will provide top performance for high transaction volume and numbercrunching, but lesser performance in screen updates due to differences inarchitecture.andP;  The same control center screen appears on both PC and VAXversions.andP;  In fact, users can run exactly the same dBASE applications.andO;During testing, A-T has been able to port both SBT PRGs and already-compiledChampion DBO files (compiled with dBASE IV DOS version) to the VAX, wherethey run perfectly.andP;  Such programs aren't optimized for the VAX environment,but they run well, which is the point.andP;  Programs can then be enhanced tobetter take advantage of such VAX capabilities as multiple processes.andM;A-T foresees lots of appeal to VAX users, because PC-style software is betterat some things.andP;  dBASE features like QBE (Query By Example) are exciting andnovel to VAX users.andP;  Horizontal scroll is a major programming job in COBOL,yet it is done with a single BROWSE command in dBASE.andP;  PC users seehorizontal scrolling as a basic feature, but using COBOL, VAX and mainframeprogrammers face a very difficult job.andP;  The standard VAX keyboard is quitedifferent, so A-T provides a plastic keyboard template.andP;  Screen updates onany computer that uses a terminal are done serially, which looks slower, likescree updates made over a modem.andP;  A terminal shows 24 lines only, a PC 25lines.andP;  Developers can limit screens to 24 lines or can optionally displayline 25 instead of line 24, A VAX can't load and call routines designed foran Intel-based PC.andP;  The protect command of dBASE IV is not available on theVAX version.andM;Comparing compiled dBASE programs running on a VAX 3600 and a Compaq 386/16,the VAX is about two times faste A.T.andP;  thinks a DEC Unix-based machine may befour to five times faster for about the same price as a loaded Compaq 386.andM;To approach its multi-platform strategy from a different direction, A-Trecently acquired a majority interest in InterBase software Corp.andP;  InterBaseproduces a peer-to-peer workstation network that runs in a DEC VAXenvironment, but which also links workstations from Sun, Apollo andHewlett-Packard.andP;  A-T calls if an object-oriented &quot;information network,&quot;because it stores documents, pictures, graphics and sound in a relationaldatabase.andP;  InterBase, which A-T claims offers the purest implementation oftransparent, distributed SQL, works with DEC's RDB database.andP;  Plans call forstretching it to work with DOS, OS/2 and Macintosh workstations, to add adBASE front-end to the InterBase engine, to make is compatible with theA-T/Microsoft/Sybase SQL server engine, and, and to provide connectivity toDB2 and HPSQL.andM;dBASE IV and SQLandM;Support for SQL is a vital part of A-T's strategy for dBASE IV.andO;Unfortunately, the local SQL statement processor in version 1.0 is seriouslyflawed.andP;  A-T has admitted it returns inconsistent and inaccurate results fromSQL queries.andP;  Version 1.1 will fix the undependable built-in SQL processor,and optionally link to a remote SQL engine located on a network server.andO;Budge says adding support for SQL Server requires a major change to thefundamental architecture of the software.andP;  In dBASE IV 1.1, users have theoption to access two completely different database engines.andP;  According toBudge, the choice of engine will dramatically after performance.andP;  If theinternal engine is used, dBASE will behave more or less like a does now.andO;When redirected to the engine in the SQL Server, some aspects that arerelatively slow will speed 1p, which other actions may slow down.andM;When the local engine is used with a SQL command, dBASE IV first translatesit is dBASE language DBO code before execution.andP;  On a network, the entiredata file is then sent from the server drive to the locl workstation for dataselection and processing.andP;  The translation of commands from SQL to the dBASElanguage creates a noticeable pause.andP;  In 1.0 the &quot;pause&quot; seems unacceptablylong; 1.1 should shorten the wait.andP;  Speed isn't the point anyway, accordingto Budge, who calls it &quot;a misconception that SQL will be better all thetime.&quot;andP;  The reason to use SQL commands with the local engine version of dBASEIV is not to gain execution speed, but to gain programming speed.andP;  SQL letsyou do complex queries with less code.andP;  When mated with the SQL Serverengine, many SQL statements should offer a strong performance advantage overcomparable dBASE commands.andM;In using dBASE IV with SQL Server, execution of a SQL command is completelydifferent.andP;  First, dBASE IV normalizes the SQL statement (puts it into aconsistent format), then sends it to SQL Server, which will respond quickly,processing the database and returning just the requested records to theworkstation.andP;  There is no translation step to slow things down, and networktraffic is reduced significantly because only a subset of data makes the tripback to the user.andM;Competitors, notably Fox, have ridiculed the requirement to place SQLstatements in separate PRS files and the use of SET SQL ON/OFF to switch fromdBASE to SQL mode at the dot prompt.andP;  Can't dBASE IV be taught to recognize aSQL command when it encounters one?andP;  Budge explains this was done primarilyfor philosophical reasons, to enforce segregation of dBASE code versus SQLcode in programs.andP;  He thinks there are times when mixing SQL and dBASE codecould be very confusing.andP;  Budge advises that SQL isolation is not as limitingas it appears.andP;  He points out that in a dBASE/SQL application all of theinterface commands (define menu, activate menu, on pad, etc.) can be used ina PRS file; there is no need to use a PRG for these commands.andP;  Everythingexcept data definition and manipulation works in SQL mode.andM;Developing with dBASE IVandM;Budge is proud of the power built into dBASE IV to automate many aspects ofapplication development, including the generation of dBASE code.andP;  He thinksthere's very little that actually has to be coded line by line in dBASE IV,meaning &quot;programming&quot; can be done at a much higher level.andP;  Budge thinks muchcan be done with AppGen (the dBASE IV applications generator), depending upongoals.andP;  List-oriented applications are the most suitable.andP;  Perform elementarydata checking, hook up an interface, build forms, etc., without knowinganything about programming.andP;  Budge positions the dBASE IV AppGen forproductivity users, people he thinks are unlikely to exceed its limits.andP;  Aproductivity user is someone who uses a product to get work done; a developeruses a product to build an application for a productivity user.andP;  A-T assumesmany proudctivity users will embrace menu-driven dBASE IV programming toolslike QBE, Forms/Label/Report generators, and AppGen, but draw the line atactual source code programming.andP;  Budge agrees that there are limits, calling&quot;application generator&quot; a misused term that suggests more than A-T, Fox oranyone else delivers.andP;  He says that to do real application generationrequires a large degree of artificial intelligence (AI), expert systems, andmore.andM;Developers should be willing to use programming automation.andP;  &quot;The real nameof the game,&quot; Budge says, &quot;is solving customer problems.andP;  The need is for thedeveloper to be an expert at taking a set of tools and applying them.andP;  A-T'sgoal is to provide the developer with tools.&quot;andP;  Budge characterizes thecurrent set of tools as &quot;part of the road Ashton-Tate is traveling down.&quot;andM;What about the complex template language that underlies the dBASE IVapplications generator?andP;  Does A-T really expect a developer to become fluentin another language just to reduce the time spent writing dBASE code?andP;  Budgesays, &quot;The template language happened by chance.&quot;andP;  It is a technology A-Tdeveloped as a flexible back end for developing dBASE interfaces.andP;  They foundit useful enough to make it available to customers.andP;  He describes it as &quot;alist processing language, not a database language.andP;  It was not intended to bean addition to the dBASE language.&quot;andM;Keeping up with the JonesesandM;We didn't hear anything about the Ashton-Tate/Fox Software lawsuit fromanyone except Chairman and CEO Ed Esber.andP;  Even Esber implied he would behappier extracting licensing fees from Fox and others than from exterminatingthem (see our interview with Esber).andP;  The product people we talked with seemto accept that dBASE language-compatible products are here to stay.andM;Recognizing that strong competitors exist, A-T product people view them as amarketplace reality that must be met constructively.andP;  Doing so is achallenge.andP;  While A-T always wants to close any competitive gap, Budge admitsit probably won't be able to.andP;  &quot;Nantucket, Fox and WordTech stay alive bycreating the gap.andP;  Ashton-Tate is in the early steps of adding enough goodiesto dBASE IV to be an attractive alternative.&quot;andP;  Besides, A-T is trying toaddress a larger customer base, hence the multiplatform strategy.andP;  Someonewho needs to spread dBASE applications across PCs, VAXes, and beyond won't beas concerned about the extra commands, functions and DOS performance ofFoxBASE+ or Clipper.andP;  Budge takes the long view.andP;  &quot;The principal long-termthreats are coming from completely different database vendors.andP;  From astrategic standpoint, if we are not aggressive and leading the game, therewon't be any arena.&quot;andM;How close is dBASE to losing the war?andP;  Don't worry, yet.andP;  Budge points outthat dethroning dBASE is tougher than it looks.andP;  &quot;While Ashton-Tate has beenevolving and expanding dBASE from a 64K machine product, others have beentrying to get mini/mainframe products squeezed on a PC.&quot;andP;  Budge says neitherapproach can declare victory yet.andP;  &quot;Clearly there's additional opportunityfor Ashton-Tate to improve dBASE.andP;  But other competitors have a ways to go toget their products running on what the majority of the world calls a PC.andO;Half of the world has an 8088-or 8086-based computer with 640K or less!&quot;andM;SQL ServerandM;A-T's SQL Server is also for the higher end.andP;  You need at least 6M of RAMjust for the server, which must run OS/2.andP;  The OS/2 requirement excludes SQLServer from the local area network gorilla Novell, which must run its ownNetWare on the server.andP;  A-T is looking to Novell for a solution, whichinvolves adding named pipe support to NetWare.andP;  Fox, in contrast, has adoptedNovell's SQL engine as the basis for their FoxServer.andP;  Budge says supportingadditional SQL engines may eventually become important, but A-T isn't workingon other server strategies at present.andP;  &quot;The database server market is veryembryonic.andP;  [After SQL Server] we'll step back and wait for the marketplaceto clear the air.&quot;andM;SQL Server is not a trivial product.andP;  Are there enough OS/2 systems around togive SQL Server a market?andP;  Product Manager Jim Reilly reverses the issue.andO;&quot;OS/2 will not be accepted until there are good applications, like dBASE IVSQL Server.&quot;andP;  Because of its intimate connection, dBASE IV 1.1 has a highdegree of functionality with the Sybase SQL Server engine that A-T ismarketing.andP;  Later A-T wants dBASE IV to access IBM's OS/2 Extended Editiondatabase server with reasonable functionality (but not as tight as theconnection to SQL Server).andP;  Access to DEC's Rdb relational DBMS is coming inthe future.andM;Because SQL Server is a systems-oriented product, Reilly identifies a host ofvital issues: support, hotline information, emergency response, upgrades, bugfixes, design, consulting (physical and logical), integration, vendormanagement, and training.andP;  Only highly qualified, specially trained VARs willbe authorized to sell and support SQL Server, under a complex plan thatdefines several levels of participants.andM;Reilly foresees the creation of an industry around SQL Server.andP;  Given theconsiderable risk and expense of entering the SQL Server market, the unknownpotential, and the fact that several competitors are dropping lines into thesame pond, value-added resellers may approach cautiously, if at all.andP;  Thepower of incompatible Novell should not be dismissed lightly.andP;  Reilly admitsthat unit sales of the core product may be small, but the support issues areso large that he thinks a reseller can develop major revenue from the overallrelationship, perhaps $10,000 to $15,000 per copy of SQL Server sold.andP;  Reillysees SQL Serves as &quot;a new opportunity to develop added value, to rise abovethe commodity level VAR.andP;  If technically more capable, a VAR will have thetechnology to take advantage of to grow.&quot;andM;Developer relationsandM;What about regular dBASE developers?andP;  Many feel A-T has kicked sand in theirfaces for a long time.andP;  Wonderful promises were made at last September'sdevelopers' conference, only to be broken.andP;  dBASE IV was not going to bereleased until it was ready.andP;  The Developer's Edition with network supportwould be shipped at the same time.andP;  Version 1.1 would be available when SQLServer appeared.andP;  The dBASE Professional Compiler would appear in Spring1989.andP;  None of this happened as announced.andP;  Should developers give A-T onemore chance?andM;Budge says yes, calling dBASE developers &quot;the foundation of Ashton-Tate'sbusiness.andP;  A-T depends on them.andP;  Giving them good tools is what our businessis all about.&quot;andP;  He doesn't care whether the developer is in a largecorporation or a small independent business.andP;  All developers have the sameset of problems.andP;  Budge says large corporations with large systems are justthe tip of the iceberg.andP;  According to A-T research, 80 percent of developershave three or fewer clients.andP;  As Budge puts it, &quot;The little guy is the guy!&quot;andM;Ron Dennis, head of Developer Services, is also making plans to pulldevelopers back into the A-T flock.andP;  He calls himself an evangelist for A-Tproducts outside the company, and an advocate for developers within.andP;  Whendevelopers have special needs, Dennis urges management to respondsupportively.andM;For example, A-T tried to charge developers for inclusion in the secondedition of the Developer Registry.andP;  Dennis says the third edition reverts togiving registered developers a free listing, special tech support, and accessto low priced evaluation copies of A-T software.andP;  Previous editions of theRegistry have been hard to find, hard to use, and rarely brought developersany new business.andP;  Dennis is redesigning the book and placing it onCompuServe for electronic browsing.andP;  He wants to get as many developersregistered as possible, so they have more clout within A-T.andP;  One of theproblems, as yet unsolved, is that developers are invisible to A-T.andP;  Someonemay be very successful promoting the merits of dBASE, but since productsaren't purchased directly from A-T, there's no way to know who is responsibleand give credit where it is due.andM;One important promise made at the conference has been kept.andP;  Outsiders nowhave several voices inside A-T.andP;  The dLAB group (dBASE Language AdvisoryBoard), greeted with skepticism when it was announced, has met productivelyseveral times.andP;  Dennis says.andP;  &quot;We surprised them because we seemed to listento them.&quot;andP;  dLAB has 15 members representing the views of corporate andindependent developers and independent software vendors.andP;  The focus of dLABis mostly on the dBASE language, not dBASE the product.andP;  In addition, dBASEtrainer and speaker Adam Green has been hired as a consultant to provide A-Tmanagement with his perspective.andM;As a veteran A-T employee (he started with the late George Tate near thebeginning), Dennis is also a realist.andP;  He acknowledges the power of FoxBASE+and Clipper, but considers them to be place-holder products until dBASE IV isready to reclaim its throne.andP;  Dennis thinks developers should now berecommending A-T products.andP;  &quot;I am not sure Ashton-Tate will ever be able tosupply the lead developers with all the tools they want fast enough.andP;  But Ido want to provide them with tools to recommend to the rest of world.&quot;andM;Another developer conference is scheduled for this Fall, with topics rangingfrom inter-platform connectivity to dBASE programming tips.andP;  The developernewsletter, issued every quarter, will have more current information, and ashift in focus to technical issues.andP;  The publication, TechNotes, has returnedto its roots as a product-specific technical journal.andP;  The marketing hypethat turned recent A-T publications into junk mail is being banished.andM;User groups, another hot spot in the dBASE world, are getting renewedattention from A-T.andP;  The user group program is designed to bridge the gapbetween users and the company.andP;  Marcie Glickman, Manager of User GroupSupport, says A-T is hosting high end seminars for sophisticated users aroundthe country, and making presentations to user groups of all sizes.andP;  A-T iswilling to sponsor events and even donate funds to cover expenses.andP;  Keymanagement, product marketing, and tech support people are available toaddress groups.andP;  Two quarterly user group newsletters, for DOS and Macproducts, have reverted to a technical orientation with tips and techniques,not sales pitches.andM;A-T needs user groups, which help promote products by being an extension ofboth marketing and technical support.andP;  Glickman is another Ashton-Tater whois realistic about the marketplace.andP;  It's okay with her if a dBASE user groupalso supprts FoxBASE+, Clipper and Quicksilver users, since they do anyway.andO;She says A-T is not afraid of users who ask hard questions.andP;  &quot;If you reallywant to know what users want, just ask.andP;  Users are what got Ashton-Tate towhere it is.&quot;andM;The third-party community, producers of so many vital dBASE add-ons, has beenseverely battered during the past two years.andP;  The announcement offeature-rich dBASE IV caused many buying decisions to be postponed, causingthinly-capitalized firms to look elsewhere for income.andP;  Even the more robustcompanies didn't know what add-ons to develop.andP;  And A-T did not seem to care.andO;Joe Budge concurs.andP;  &quot;For a long time,&quot; he says, &quot;Ashton-Tate managementreally did not believe there was a place for third parties--yet that wasduring the very time the third-party market was flourishing.andP;  We went foryears between dBASE III PLUS and dBASE IV.andP;  This gave add-ons a long periodto get established and become set in their ways, making themselves veryvulnerable to changes.&quot;andP;  Now that dBASE IV is here, Budge sees a healthyaftermarket for add-ons.andP;  He says the company &quot;has a much better relationshipthan before with third party developers&quot; and finally recognizes theirimportance, significance and &quot;tremendous strategic value to Ashton-Tate.&quot;andM;Budge and Ron Dennis agree that A-T's technical support still needs work, andsoon.andP;  A-T is extremely aware of the need for solid tech support of version1.1, and intends to provide it.andP;  They promise to be candid about any problemsa product may have.andP;  As Director of Corporate Communications Delia Fernandezsays, &quot;We've learned it doesn't do any good to hide from the intelligence ofour customers.andP;  This is not a good strategy.&quot;andM;Is Ashton-Tate really better?andM;Why should developers believe A-T has turned over a new leaf--again?andP;  Theonly reason A-T gives, intangible though it may be, is their claim to nowunderstand the essential role of developers in the success of dBASE.andP;  Commonsense suggests that A-T would have to be crazy not to cater to the mostimportant people in the dBASE world.andP;  That's what they say, and I believethey mean it.andP;  The product people I've met at A-T seem candid and devoted tothe task of making dBASE the best development tool they can.andM;Product people may be sincere, but will management, inevitably focused on thebottom line, back them up?andP;  A-T claims to have changed its mind on a lot ofthings.andP;  They've learned some lessons the hard way and have decided to changehow they run the business.andP;  In fact, Ed Esber told both Wall Street and theannual shareholders meeting that A-T will no longer be focused on quarterlyshipments.andP;  (Concern over quarterly performance is the presumed reason dBASEIV 1.0 was rush-released October 28, 1988, the end of A-T's third fiscalquarter.)andM;Watch usandM;Throughout A-T I head about a renewed spirit of reconciliation, openess,achievement and success.andP;  Fox and Nantucket don't seem to be viewed ascompetitors that should be matched feature for feature.andP;  Instead, A-T haswider goals and seeks reasonable performance in balance with wideconnectivity.andP;  Their strategy is to be a database management and applicationdevelopment standard spanning PCs to minis to mainframes, covering everysignificant operating system with 100 percent code compatibility--no smallrequirement.andP;  It may be that only a company with A-T's resources can take onthis task and hope to succeed.andM;Ashton-Tate people have a new slogan: &quot;Watch us!&quot;andP;  They want to be judged onproducts, not promises.andP;  &quot;Don't trust me--just watch what I do,&quot; they say.andO;That's fair.andP;  Tough though it may be to forget the past and overlook themerits and motives of the lawsuit against Fox Software, maybe we shouldsuspend disbelief and watch A-T deliver.andP;  If the dBASE world is to stand upagainst the onslaught of would-be exterminators, a strong, successfulAshton-Tate may be its principal defender.andM;John L. Hawkins is the president of HawkTek Corp., a nationalcomputer/management consulting and database development firm.andP;  Mr. Hawkins isalso a college computer/accounting teacher, user group president, author ofHawk's RAM and Accountants Microcomputer Report, and Contributing Editor ofData Based Advisor.andP;  He can be reached at P.O.
