This fall's debut of the Lexus SC 300 will mark the firsthead-to-head competition in luxury cars between the twostrongest Japanese auto makers in the U.S. market.</LP><TEXT>   The SC 300 will carry a preliminary base price of $32,000.That's about $1,100 more than the base price of the AcuraLegend coupe, which has versions priced up to $36,300. Toyotamade the announcement yesterday when it unveiled aneight-cylinder version of its luxury coupe called the SC 400.It will hit dealer showrooms June 1 with a base price of$37,500.   Acura has avoided directly butting bumpers with Lexus byaiming the Legend at a slightly different niche than Toyota'sluxury cars. When Honda revamped the Legend last fall, forexample, it chose to stick with a six-cylinder engine insteadof moving to an eight-cylinder one like that of Lexus'sflagship LS 400. Honda has kept the Legend's price below thatof the LS 400 as well.   Toyota, however, apparently isn't interested in acollision-avoidance strategy. The company says it hopes toignite some excitement in the luxury sports-car segment,which has been battered by the recession. &quot;Luxury-coupe saleshave rebounded slightly but have remained stagnant the lastthree years,&quot; said J. Davis Illingworth, Toyota's generalmanager of Lexus.   But &quot;just as styling helped kill the luxury sport-coupemarket, it can help revive it,&quot; Mr. Illingworth said.&quot;There's plenty of pent-up demand for a true luxury sportcoupe, one that makes a dramatic styling statement all itsown.&quot; That was a thinly veiled reference to the Legend, which-- despite its sales success -- has been criticized inautomotive-enthusiast magazines for conservative styling.   Honda, which introduced a redesigned Legend coupe in theU.S. in February, responded coolly to the announcement of theLexus luxury coupe. &quot;It's understandable why they areattracted to that segment,&quot; a Honda spokesman said. &quot;The{sales} volume is high.&quot;   Lexus expects to sell about 20,000 SC 400 models next yearbut declined to give a sales estimate for the SC 300 model.Mr. Illingworth said the SC 400 is coming out first becauseit is equipped with the same engine now used in the LS 400sedan. Toyota is developing a new six-cylinder, 24-valveengine for the SC 300 that wasn't ready to hit the marketthis spring, Mr. Illingworth said.   Still, the new coupes probably won't allow Lexus to catchAcura in total U.S. sales. Last year, Acura sold 138,384cars, while Lexus sold 63,534 models.   Team One Advertising, a division of Saatchi andamp; Saatchi DFSInc., developed the Lexus coupe television spots and 24-pagemagazine inserts that will hit the market next week.</TEXT></DOC>
