Bishop (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> PHA </IN><TEXT>   More evidence emerged that a cancer virus is contaminating the nation's supply of banked blood.    Researchers in New York City reported evidence that some hospital patients who had received multiple blood transfusions had been infected with the virus. This follows other, tentative reports in recent months hinting that 1% to 4% of blood donors in some localities and as many as 9% of drug addicts tested in New York City may be infected with the virus.    Such reports prompted the American Red Cross last November to urge rapid development and federal approval of a definitive test that could be used to screen blood donors for evidence of infection by the cancer virus.    The cancer virus is related to the AIDS virus and is believed to be spread by the same routes, that is, by blood transfusions, sexual contact and the sharing of contaminated needles among drug addicts. The virus is known to cause a rare but rapidly fatal type of leukemia that, until now, has been confined largely to southern Japan, and certain areas in Africa and the Caribbean. It also has been linked to a multiple sclerosis -- like nerve ailment, called tropical spastic paraparesis, occurring in children in the Caribbean.    The virus is known as HTLV-1, for human T-cell leukemia virus.    The presence of the virus in the blood supply poses an unusual public health dilemma. Although only 1% of people infected with the virus develop leukemia, the blood cancer doesn't occur until many years, perhaps decades, after the initial infection. An increase in the incidence of leukemia that would confirm that the virus is spreading among Americans mightn't occur for another decade. By that time, millions might have become infected, leading to an epidemic of tens of thousands of cases lasting well into the next century.    The newest evidence of the virus's presence in the blood supply was reported in the New England Journal of Medicine by a research team at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. They tested blood samples from 211 patients who had been treated at the center for various types of leukemia. None of the patients suffered the T-cell type of leukemia caused by the virus, but all had received multiple transfusions of blood during their therapy. Six of the patients had antibodies to HTLV-1, indicating they had been exposed to the virus. All of these patients died of their blood cancers long before there was any chance of developing disease from the HTLV-1.    The researchers said they couldn't determine when the six patients had been infected. The tests were run on blood samples that had been taken and stored for other reasons. But in three of the patients, samples were available that were taken before the transfusions. These were negative for the virus antibodies, while samples from the same patients taken after transfusions were positive. There wasn't any way of determining who donated the contaminated blood.    Last fall, the Red Cross said it had completed preliminary screening of blood from 40,000 healthy donors and found 10 who might be positive for HTLV-1 exposure. More elaborate and time-consuming tests now are being done to check the accuracy of this preliminary screening. This prevalence, though tiny, is about the same as the prevalence of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus in donated blood before screening programs began.    Studies in Japan have confirmed that HTLV-1 can be transmitted by blood transfusions, but so far there aren't any known cases of T-cell leukemia developing in people so infected. The New York scientists noted, however, that patients such as theirs, who receive multiple transfusions, can serve as a &quot;sensitive indicator&quot; of the virus's presence in the blood supply. </TEXT></DOC>
