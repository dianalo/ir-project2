President Reagan said he will sign a bill raising the federal debt limit. In addition, the Group of Seven nations, meeting in Washington, reaffirmed its February currency-stabilization accord, designed to keep dollar exchange rates within certain broad ranges.    Even so, says William H. Gross, a managing director of Pacific Investment Management Co., the Bank of Japan's curb on commercial bank lending, announced Friday, &quot;is a very serious development.&quot; Citing U.S. dependence on foreign capital to finance its deficits, he says yields on 30-year Treasury bonds, now 9.68%, could surge to 10% &quot;within the next few weeks.&quot;    The Japanese credit tightening jolted traders here and left the U.S. bond market mired in a severe slump. Bond prices now stand at close to their lowest levels of the year after a sharp sell-off last Thursday. Japanese officials said the move was aimed at keeping inflation low. Still, some analysts argue that U.S. investors overreacted.    &quot;We don't see any significant shift in (Japanese) monetary policy that would pose a conflict&quot; for stable exchange rates among the Group of Seven industrial countries, says John Lipsky, a manager of international bond research at Salomon Brothers Inc. He believes the U.S. market response to the Bank of Japan move &quot;was quite unwarranted.&quot;    Over the weekend the Group of Seven -- made up of the U.S., Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- issued a strong restatement of the policy developed in its meeting in February in Paris. The reaffirmation was in line with what most analysts expected.    Using language nearly identical to that of the Louvre accord in February, the statement by the finance ministers and central bank governors of the seven nations relected satisfaction with the success of the February agreement to keep dollar exchange rates within certain broad ranges. By strongly restating the policy, the Group of Seven hopes to persuade currency markets to maintain the ranges, which have never been made public.    Even so, the U.S. credit markets face many hurdles in the weeks ahead, Mr. Lipsky and others say. Among the biggest is the prospect of $23.25 billion of new U.S. government notes and bonds to be auctioned soon. The three-part &quot;mini-refunding&quot; was delayed because of congressional and White House wrangling over budgetary and debt ceiling legislation.    President Reagan said Saturday that he would sign legislation that includes a higher debt ceiling, thus averting a federal default. The Treasury is expected to announce today the timing of its borrowing plans, including the mini-refunding.    The Treasury on Sept. 17 said the financing will consist of $9.25 billion of two-year notes, $7.25 billion of four-year notes and $6.75 billion of seven-year notes.    Mr. Ohmura of Daiwa said the bond market &quot;will be weak until November,&quot; even though he expects a relatively stable dollar against the yen. &quot;We don't think the Bank of Japan will raise its discount rate,&quot; which is the borrowing fee it charges banks, &quot;because Japan is still trying to stimulate domestic demand&quot; to reduce the huge trade surplus it has with the U.S. and its other major trading partners.    Nevertheless, he said that investor demand for Treasury and other dollar-denominated securities is waning and that any big supply of new debt will be a catalyst for higher yields. &quot;The confidence in the U.S. market among Japanese investors has been severely shaken,&quot; he said, adding that Japanese purchases of U.S. debt securities have slipped from 60% of the nation's total foreign investment in 1986 to less than 50% by the middle of this year.    &quot;We're seeing disinvestment at this point,&quot; Mr. Ohmura said, citing heavy sales of financial futures contracts since May among Daiwa's institutional clients in Japan. &quot;The dollar bond business is a negative one for us.&quot;    Some economists argue that Japanese and U.S. policy-makers are overreacting to fears of higher inflation and that restrictive credit policies could create an economic slump. But most economists in several recent surveys expect continued economic growth in the the coming year. Many also predict further declines in the dollar, which they say will lead to higher U.S. inflation.    &quot;You're swimming upstream if you're talking about lower interest rates ahead,&quot; said William M. Brachfeld, an executive president at Daiwa.    Even though the Bank of Japan's slight credit tightening doesn't appear to represent a major policy change, some analysts worry that it could contribute to further weakness in the dollar. The gap between yields on comparable U.S. and Japanese bonds has shrunk, which analysts say diminishes the appeal of U.S. bonds to Japanese investors.    &quot;Should the dollar falter, it will increase pressure on us (the Federal Reserve) to increase interest rates further,&quot; says Raymond Stone, associate director of research at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. &quot;We are probably going to get higher interest rates throughout the world over the next several months.&quot;    Robert Brusca, chief economist of Nikko Securities Co. International, contends that Federal Reserve officials probably won't react to the Japanese move. He predicts the Fed &quot;is just going to sit back and watch,&quot; rather than make a similar credit-tightening move.    Mr. Brusca and many other analysts argue that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan probably assumes further declines in the dollar are inevitable in view of the huge U.S. trade deficit. Some say the best the Fed can do is to try to prevent precipitous dollar declines that would send shock waves through the financial markets.    ---   Friday's Bond Activity   Treasury bond prices inched higher in light trading, regaining only a small part of their large losses Thursday. Some actively traded 30-year issues fell about one point for the week, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount.    The latest 30-year Treasury issue, the 8 7/8% bonds due 2017, was quoted late Friday at a price of 92 6/32 to yield 9.68%. That was up slightly from Thursday's close of 92 1/32, where the yield was 9.69%. On Sept. 18, it stood at 93 1/4, where the yield was 9.56%.    The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 rose to 94 10/32 from 94 5/32 Thursday, while the yield declined to 9.52% from 9.55%. A week earlier, they stood at 95 1/8 to yield 9.39%.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 0.63 point Friday to 1177.69. It hovered in an unusually tight range, staying between 1175.25 and 1180.52.    Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills were higher. The latest three-month Treasury bill rate rose to 6.52% bid from 6.42% Thursday. The latest six-month bill rate increased to 6.87% bid from 6.8%.    Among other short-term rates, the federal funds rate averaged 7.3% Friday, down slightly from 7.35% Thursday. In the week ended Wednesday, the rate on funds, or reserves that banks lend each other, averaged about 7 1/4%. </TEXT></DOC>
