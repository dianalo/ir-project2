Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.,chairman of the committee, said Thursday.   The panel spent three days this week rejecting a series ofchallenges by conservative Republicans to the Intermediate-rangeNuclear Forces treaty and has set Tuesday afternoon for a finalvote on the pact.   Pell and other Democratic leaders have predicted overwhelmingapproval, both in the committee next week and by the full Senatenext month when the Democratic-controlled chamber returns from anEaster recess. Ratification requires the approval of 67 of the 100senators.   The remaining fight centers on the dispute between thelegislative and executive branches over the authority to interprettreaties. The disagreement arises from President Reagan's assertionthat his administration can unilaterally change the intepretationof the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, a contention the Senatedisputes.   Pell and other Democrats want some type of condition on the INFtreaty that would block a future administration from changing theU.S. interpretation of the pact.   Lugar said one compromise being considered is attaching anamendment to the ratification resolution which says the INF treatycannot be reinterpreted by a future administration without priorconsent of the Senate.   ``That is one ay to solve it and remove the fight from thistreaty without coming to a final answer on the intepretationissue,'' said Lugar.   The treaty was signed Dec. 8 by Reagan and Soviet leader MikhailS. Gorbachev. It requires the elimination within three years of allmissiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles. Anti-cheatingprovisions _ the strictest in arms control history _ includeprovisions for on-site inspections by each superpower in the othercountry.   In the Senate, the treaty has been criticized chiefly byconservative Republicans, including Sens. Jesse Helms of NorthCarolina and Larry Pressler of South Dakota.   Senate officials are preparing for an unusual secret session ofthe Senate early next week to examine sensitive intelligenceinformation about the number of SS-20 medium-range missilespossessed by the Soviet Union.   A total of 650 were declared by the Soviets and those will bedestroyed after the treaty takes effect. But Helms claims there areconflicting estimates by U.S. intelligence agencies about thenumber of missiles, including one report by the DefenseIntelligence Agency that the Soviets may have up to 300 more SS-20sthan they have declared.   The Foreign Relations panel voted 15-2 Thursday to reject Helms'amendment requiring new intelligence analyses of the SS-20question. Only Helms and Pressler supported his proposal whichwould have required Reagan to certify the accuracy of the Sovietclaims that they only have 650 SS-20s.   The closed-door session will take place in the Capitol's OldSenate Chamber, according to Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd,D-W.Va.   The small, historic room is normally maintained as a museum, butByrd said it is better for the meeting than the current Senatechamber. The new Senate is laced with a variety of cables that makeit more difficult to protect security, Byrd explained.   Later, the committee also rejected, 15-2, Pressler's plan toblock implementation of the treaty until Reagan certifies that NATOwon't be jeopardized by the Soviets' advantage in a variety ofnon-nuclear weapons.   Helms originally had 36 amendments, but dropped the majority ofthem after only Pressler supported his proposals. Pressler alsodropped some of his challenges in the face of widespread rejection.</TEXT></DOC>
