INI hopes to reduce its deficit further this year, although probably not by the same percentage. Much of the reduction in the 1986 loss reflected INI's sale of the troubled auto maker Socieded Espanola de Automoviles de Turismo to Volkswagen AG of West Germany. Iberia, Spain's flag-carrier airline, posted a profit for the first time in 10 years, which also helped narrow the group's loss.    WOOLWORTH HOLDINGS PLC and SUPERDRUG STORES PLC said they agreed on the terms of a recommended offer Woolworth will make for Superdrug. The announcement comes 11 days after Woolworth, a British retailer, failed to agree on terms with Underwoods PLC, another British drugstore chain. The terms of the offer are 17 new Woolworth shares for every 20 Superdrug shares. The offer values Superdrug at the equivalent of $11.21 a share, or about $393 million for the whole company. A cash alternative of $10.40 a share indicates a value of $365 million for Superdrug. Woolworth Holdings isn't related to F.W. Woolworth Co. of the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
