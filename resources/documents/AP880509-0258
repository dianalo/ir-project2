The microscopically compact chips were made for the DefenseDepartment by IBM's Federal Systems facility in Manassas, Va., thecompany said. They will be used for such things as capturing andprocessing radar and sonar signals.   ``This is a significant technological milestone for IBM and theU.S. Department of Defense,'' William Gianopulos, laboratorydirector of IBM in Manassas, said in a news release.   ``IBM is leading the pack,'' Sonny Maynard, the director of theDefense Department's Very High Speed Integrated Circuit program,said in the release.   Honeywell Inc. and TRW Inc., the other two companies that havedefense contracts to develop half-micron chips, have not completedtheirs yet. TRW spokesman Timothy Dolan said the company was onschedule toward a September 1989 deadline on its self-healing``super chip,'' which will have about 4 million transistors,compared to about 100,000 for IBM's chip.   Honeywell spokeswoman Susan Eich said her company was also onschedule.   Compact chips run faster because the electricity has lessdistance to travel. A micron is one-millionth of a meter, or aboutone-hundredth the thickness of a sheet of typing paper.   IBM's contract with the Pentagon restricts how IBM can use thehalf-micron technology for its commercial products, spokesman MarkRoot said.   Chip companies such as Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro DevicesInc. are planning new fabrication lines for half-micron chips,according to Scott Hudson, a market research analyst for IntegratedCircuit Engineering Corp. in Scottsdale, Ariz.   ``This is what all the semiconductor makers are shooting for,''Hudson said.</TEXT></DOC>
