 3270 terminalemulators.andP;  The system, expected to be fully implemented by the end of theyear, covers all phases of the judicial process, from creating cases to theirfinal disposition.andM;At a cost of $1.1 million, with another $540,000 expected to be spent onimplementing the final network segment, the Maryland system will replace muchof the courts' paper-based forms-processing setup, which currently requiresan army of data-entry clerks working with a central mainframe, according toProject Manager Buck Webb.andM;The goal is to provide all users -- from commissioners to court clerks andcashiers -- with instant, statewide access to any changes in the status ofpending cases, effectively speeding up the judicial process.andM;&quot;We think we're in the forefront of court processing,&quot; said Webb, who isbased in Annapolis.andP;  &quot;No one else is doing this on such a scale.&quot;andM;Three of the system's components -- a court commissioner's segment forinitiating cases, a clerk's office/information-center segment for casemaintenance, and a cashier's segment -- are now up and running, said Webb,while the court segment went into prototype two weeks ago.andP;  The system isbeing implemented in 10 of Maryland's 12 judicial districts; two of thedistricts are large enough to support their own mainframe installations, hesaid.andM;The benefits of the new system are already apparent.andP;  &quot;Our case load isincreasing constantly, but we're able to handle additional cases with noadditional personnel,&quot; said Gloria Farver, administrative clerk for District10 in Ellicott City.andP;  &quot;We've saved at least half the time, and we expect alot more when the courtroom program goes in.&quot;andM;The Maryland implementation was inspired by the state of California'sStatscan system, which incorporates bar codes and hand-held scanners tocollect case disposition statistics in &quot;an almost real-time manner,&quot; saidWebb.andP;  He added, however, that California's system automates only a fractionof the administrative support functions required to dispense justice.andM;The Maryland system was also inspired by necessity.andP;  &quot;We were responding tothe fact that our case volume goes up 10 percent to 12 percent per year, andwe're already overloaded,&quot; said Webb, adding that the 10 districts processthousands of cases every day.andM;The system is intended to simplify data entry, data access and management forthe participating districts.andP;  Each of the segments, composed ofmainframe-based Customer Information Control System (CICS) applications andcooperative PC-based programs written by in-house programmers using ICOT'slow-level application programming interface, relies on a client/server setupfor drawing data from a repository on the host.andM;&quot;The PC does a command that says, 'Give me this case number,' &quot; said Webb.andO;&quot;The mainframe sees that, finds the case and all related cases, and sends itall down to the PC.andP;  The user interface, forms processing and data collectionare all done on the PC.&quot;andM;In the commissioner's segment, users working with Memorex Telex PCs attachedto the IBM mainframe create cases by entering, for instance, biographicalinformation on each suspect, along with all of the charges against thesuspect, via a forms template.andM;After being uploaded to the host, the data is automatically routed to anappropriate database (categorized by case type) by a custom host-basedprogram, according to Webb.andP;  The data is then available to the othersegments, eliminating the need to rekey the collected data for each program.andM;Before the advent of the system, biographical data and charges were writtenon paper forms, sent to the data-processing site by courier, and entered byclerks who keyed in the data to create cases, Webb explained.andP;  Since it couldtake days before the data was entered into the mainframe's on-linecase-management system, &quot;nobody could trust the mainframe data,&quot; he said.andM;The clerk's office/information-center segment tracks events that occur duringthe processing of each case, such as non-payment of fines or no-shows incourt.andP;  For example, users can more easily monitor defendants who don'tappear in court on the required date, then issue bench warrants.andP;  Thissegment also allows users to more efficiently issue subpoenas for witnessesto appear.andM;Prior to the project, case updates were done through the mail, resulting indelays that could have &quot;significant repercussions,&quot; Webb said.andM;&quot;Say someone pays a fine, and it doesn't get updated.andP;  A warrant gets issuedand the poor guy goes to jail until things get cleared up,&quot; Webb said.andO;&quot;We've created a tighter system that makes it harder for clerical errors tohappen.&quot;andM;Accuracy Is ParamountandM;The courtroom segment is the toughest to implement because it demands thegreatest accuracy, according to Webb.andM;&quot;We can't afford to drop a single disposition,&quot; he explained.andP;  &quot;Plus, thejudge owns his courtroom, and if he doesn't like the system, he doesn't haveto allow it in the courtroom.&quot;andM;This segment will include a PC in each courtroom that contains the docket,which lists the cases scheduled for a given day.andP;  The courtroom clerk willuse the PC to record the disposition of each case, produce the paper formsrequired and, at the end of the court session, send all the updated casesback to the host to &quot;complete the loop from beginning to end,&quot; said Webb.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
