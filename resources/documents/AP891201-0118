A Salvadoran photographer for Agence France-Presse was killedand a Red Cross worker with him was wounded in Soyapango, one ofthe neighborhoods where the armed forces said fighting took placeovernight.   President Alfredo Cristiani said the national situation remainedcritical but that his 5-month-old government was not in danger.   A reporter for the French agency said the photographer, EloyGuevara; the Red Cross worker, carrying a white flag; and aSalvadoran radio reporter were at a gas station at the foot of ahill in an area that saw combat earlier.   Journalists yards away from Guevara when he was shot said he wascrossing an intersection with three Red Cross workers when a burstfrom an assault rifle struck him and ricocheted off a wall.   Two reporters there agreed that judging from the angle of fire,the bullets came from the side of the street where air forceparatroopers were in complete control.   Guevara was the second journalist killed since the leftistFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, began anoffensive in the capital three weeks ago.   The other was David Blundy, 44, a veteran war correspondent whoworked for The Sunday Correspondent of London.   Gen. Maxwell Thurman, commander of the U.S. Southern Commandbased in Panama, visited El Salvador on Friday. U.S. Embassyspokesman Jeff Brown said ``the purpose of the visit was toreaffirm U.S. support and his personal commitment to the world ofthe Salvadoran armed forces.''   The armed forces press office reported fighting overnight in theCiudad Delgado neighborhood, where leftist rebels remained, andSoyapango. It said the guerrillas had left Soyapango.   Both neighborhoods were major combat zones in the early days ofthe FMLN offensive, which has made thousands of San Salvadorresidents homeless.   The offensive radically changed the decade-old guerrilla waragainst U.S.-backed governments, in which more than 71,000 peoplehave been killed. It brought heavy combat to the capital for thefirst time and the guerrillas began using anti-aircraft missiles.   Pentagon officials in Washington said introduction of themissiles meant the Salvadoran military, whose air power had facedlittle challenge, would have to change its tactics.   Military officials said Friday nine soldiers and nine guerrillashad been killed in fighting near Zacatecoluca, 25 miles south ofSan Salvador, where rebels fired a Soviet-made SAM-7 surface-to-airmissile Wednesday for the first time. A military source said themissile missed an A-37 jet fighter.   Salvador's rightist government accused Nicaragua of supplyingthe missiles and suspended relations. The United States filed aformal protest with the Soviet Union, which arms Nicaragua, and theissue is on the agenda for the weekend summit off Malta betweenPresident Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   One soldier and one guerrilla were reported wounded atTonacatepeque, 10 miles north of San Salvador.   Cristiani said a state of siege imposed after the start of theoffensive would not be lifted until violence subsided. The rulesrestrict freedoms, including freedom of the press.   San Salvador's mayor asked residents to forgo the custom ofsetting off fireworks over the Christmas holiday.   Residents of the exclusive Escalon neighborhood began repairinghouses that were shot up when guerrillas took over about 40 homesthere and in another wealthy district Wednesday. Some residentsclosed their homes and went abroad or to visit relatives.   American citizens were evacuated from the area during acease-fire the rebels declared Thursday. More than 200 U.S. Embassydependents and private citizens left El Salvador on a charterflight.   In Washington, the State Department said two of the damagedhomes were occupied by Americans. No residents were reported hurt.   Soldiers from El Salvador's toughest battalions patrolled thestreets of Escalon and surrounding neighborhoods.   Streets were littered with spent cartridges, burned-out luxurycars and downed power lines. Guerrillas withdrew under cover ofdarkness, leaving a few snipers behind.   Soldiers of the Atlacatl Battalion burned a guerrilla's body anddumped it headfirst into a mesh trash basket outside one of thefortified mansions in Escalon.   A crude cardboard sign with a skull and crossbones scrawled onit was jammed in next to the body. It said the Atlacal does nottake prisoners.   ``There is no man, no law that holds us back,'' the sign said.   A soldier said of the guerrilla: ``He thought he'd scare us. Weburned him.''</TEXT></DOC>
