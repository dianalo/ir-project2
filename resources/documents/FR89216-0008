The November 8, 1988 FR notice stated that theregulated community must include the burden statement and use only therenewed form after December 31, 1988 (53 FR 45089). However, the Officeof Solid Waste (OSW) realized that the December 31, 1988 compliance dateput an undue hardship upon the regulated community, and received from OMBa six-month extension on compliance with the requirements. Because it was not the intention of EPA or OMB to waste resources unnecessarily,or cause a situation which resulted in noncompliance of States or facilities,EPA requested a six-month extension to the expiration date of the previousform (September 30, 1988). On July 1, 1989 inclusion of the burden discIosurestatement and use of the new manifest with the expiration date of September30, 1991, will be mandatory. The extension creates a transition periodduring which either form (old or new) may be used. In the event that manifest users have remaining supplies of the old manifeston June 30, 1989, they may continue to use them after June 30, 1989, ifthey overprint the new expiration date, ``9/30/91'', over the old expirationdate, ``9/30/88'', and attach the burden disclosure statement. The burden disclosure statement required with each Uniform Hazardous WasteManifest form is as follows: Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average: 37 minutes for generators, 15 minutes for transporters, and10 minutes for treatment, storage and disposal facilities. This includestime for reviewing instructions, gathering data, and completing and reviewingthe form. Send comments regarding the burden estimate, including suggestionsfor reducing this burden to: Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington DC 20460;and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Managementand Budget, Washington DC 20503. EPA and OMB have outlined three ways in which manifest users can complywith the burden disclosure statement requirement: 1. The statement is printed on the form. The burden statement would, therefore,accompany the waste during shipment. Generators, transporters, and TSDwould have the opportunity to see the statement. 2. The statement is printed in the instructions to the form. This approachmay result in the following two outcomes, either of which is acceptableto OMB: Outcome A. The instructions may be on a separate sheet of paper which isremoved or detached from the manifest after it is filled out by the generator.The statement would not accompany the shipment. Although all parties tothe shipment may not have the opportunity to see the statement, complyingin this way is acceptable to OMB. Outcome B. The instructions may be printed on the form or on the back ofthe form. In this case, the burden statement would accompany the form duringshipment and all parties to the shipment would have the opportunity tosee it. 3. The statement is attached to the form. In this case the OMB burden statementis on a separate sheet of paper and must be conveyed with the form andthe shipment from the generator to the treatment, storage or disposal facility(TSD). One copy of the statement could accompany each multi-copy form providedit is attached in such a way as to remain with the manifest when it reachesthe TSD. The choices above outline the ways in which compliance with the OMB burdendisclosure statement can be achieved. One situation, that of the detachableinstructions, results in the burden statement not accompanying the formduring waste shipment. This is acceptable to OMB. <ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan Cannon, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Assistant Administrator for Solid Waste and Emergency Response.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-3624 Filed 2-15-89; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
