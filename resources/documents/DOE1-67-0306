One of these is a commercial DR11M boardwhich performs DMA transfers between UNIBUS and the external word. Theother is a VME module specifically developed for this application. Theinterface has been tested under VMS operating system in VAX and VALET-PLUSsystem for the VME Bus. We describe in detail the VME module and itsconnection with the DR11M. Software, both in WMS and VALET, is also described.(author) 10 figs., 7 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
