Karr (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> LBR </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Labor Department accused Kohler Co. of failing to report certain worker injuries at its Kohler, Wis., plant and proposed fining the company $1.4 million.    The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration charged Kohler with 466 instances of willful failure to record occupational injuries in 1986 and 1987. In nearly all instances, the company considered the injuries as first-aid cases for record-keeping purposes, though many were serious enough that the injured worker had to be given time off or be put on restricted duty, OSHA said.    Federal regulations don't require an employer to record first-aid cases, which don't involve lost time or duty restrictions. OSHA considers a willful violation as one in which an employer either knew that a violation had occurred or was aware that a hazardous condition existed and didn't make a reasonable effort to correct it.    &quot;We are incensed at the proposed action taken by OSHA,&quot; said Kenneth Conger, an attorney and vice president for the closely held maker of plumbing products and power systems. &quot;What they are citing for is 1986 clerical errors. A review of our records indicates these are minor errors, which have nothing to do with the Kohler Co. providing a safe environment for employees.&quot;    &quot;They imposed a fine of $1.4 million after inspection of records, but they also inspected the entire facility, which employs 3,000. As a result of that, they found a few actual safety problems and proposed a fine of $6,300.&quot;    The penalties proposed against Kohler follow a string of sizable fines sought by OSHA in recent months against employers accused of record-keeping violations. OSHA has concentrated on paperwork violations in its stepped-up enforcement efforts over the past two years. It argues that full reporting of health and safety problems is necessary to help pinpoint hazards that need correcting and to help OSHA target inspections to work sites where injuries are most likely to occur.    OSHA said injuries at the Wisconsin plant that weren't reported included lacerations, eye injuries, sprains, strains, contusions, burns, abrasions, fractures and a hernia. Last year's OSHA inspection of the plant -- which produces enamel ironware, small engines, toilets and brass fixtures -- led to 49 safety-hazard citations, as well as the $6,300 fine, which Kohler has paid.    The company has 15 working days to contest the new OSHA allegations and proposed penalties before an independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. </TEXT></DOC>
