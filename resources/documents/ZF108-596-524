 Rick Hobson of SFU's department of computer science, is the onlyresearcher he knows of in Canada taking this approach to computerarchitecture.andP;  &quot;A lot of people are skeptical,&quot; he admits.andM;But he notes that while the vast majority of research and development effortat all levels is being poured into compilers, the best-selling compilers onthe market are the ones with good interpreters added on.andM;Compiler systems are not user-friendly.andP;  Programmers must go through manyedit-compile-link-run cycles to verify their programs, said Hobson.andM;As well, compilers pick up only obvious errors.andP;  Their great advantage overthe more friendly interpreter systems is speed.andP;  Unlike interpreters,compilers do not pick up subtle errors or effectively help pinpoint problems,but they can run up to 400 times faster.andM;The Sam computer was designed to interpret software without such aperformance penalty.andP;  Hobson says his current prototype is only four to eighttimes slower than a compiler system.andP;  &quot;Furthermore, the architecture iscapable of advancing with technology.andP;  Over the next few years, asparallelism becomes better understood, direct support can be built in forparallel algorithms.&quot;andM;Hobson has spent about seven years and $600,000 worth of research grants tobring his technology to the prototype stage.andP;  Funding sources include theScience Council of B.C., SFU's Centre for Systems Science, SFU's SpecialResearch Projects Fund, MPR Teltech Ltd. and NSERC (the Natural Sciences andEngineering Research Council).andM;While Hobson developed the Sam architecture in the early 1980s (back in thedark ages when PCs were novel), he says, &quot;It's such a different architecture,it's still unique and not outdated.&quot;andM;He adds that in order to realize the product's commercial opportunities, henow has to act fast.andM;With the relatively slow pace and limited resources of the universityenvironment (compared with commercial computer system developers), Hobsonexpects it will be difficult to commercialize Sam.andP;  But he is taking steps inthat direction.andP;  The project recently received a grant from the ScienceCouncil of B.C.andP;  to research the potential markets for the product.andM;Large and unwieldyandM;Currently Sam is large and unwieldy, but if reduced to two small circuitboards, it could be sold as an add-on to various types of personal computers.andO;&quot;An optimized commercial version of our machine, using advanced 1.2 microntechnology, could executive interpretive tasks at least 100 times faster thana standard 12 MHz IBM AT,&quot; said Hobson.andM;Another application, on which Hobson has already done preliminary work, isarray data manipulation using the APL language.andP;  His prototype is 10 timesfaster at this task than an AT.andP;  Hobson notes that while there are only about200,000 APL users in the world, the language is one of the best ways to getinto parallel computing.andM;Another potential application is in speeding the interpretation ofPostScript.andP;  Next computers use a PostScript display, but the interpretationis quite slow on a conventional machine.andP;  Sam could be installed in acomputer to speed this process, and it could also be embedded in laserprinters to speed their interpretation of PostScript.andM;&quot;I believe there are lots of other possibilities,&quot; said Hobson.andP;  Programmershave the potential to benefit most from the product -- it could speed theinterpretation of many computer languages that are now interpreted slowly,including Smalltalk, VHDL and Prolog.andM;While Hobson is convinced of the product's potential, his challenge is toconvince a venture capital company or commercial systems developer to investin the technology.andP;  He estimates it will take about $2 million to develop theproduct for market.andM;The market research to be conducted this summer may help in raising capital.andO;Work to be done includes more integrations of the chips used in Sam,re-engineering of the board for increased speed, and lots of programming.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
