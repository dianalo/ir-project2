So it is no coincidence that the tobacco giant is pitching the new smoke to consumers just like decaf. Packs of Next carry the word &quot;De-Nic&quot; beneath the Next logo. The brand's ads proudly proclaim: &quot;Introducing de-nicotined tobacco with rich flavor.&quot; And, of course, the copy also tells consumers that the nicotine-removal process is natural.    Philip Morris's normally chatty tobacco PR people are still refusing to talk about the product or its positioning, even though Next is being tested in Toledo, Ohio; Omaha, Neb.; and Hartford, Conn. The campaign, created by Leo Burnett Co., is appearing in local and national media including regional editions of Time, Newsweek and People.    But marketers speculate that the company's &quot;Smoke Sanka&quot; strategy is designed to make low-nicotine Next seem as soothingly familiar to puffers as possible. &quot;They have set up a simple analogy,&quot; adds Al Ries, chairman of Trout andamp; Ries Inc., a New York marketing-strategy firm. &quot;In the minds of people, having a smoke and a cup of coffee tend to be things you do together.&quot;    Moreover, the caffeine comparison enables Philip Morris to imply it has a safer cigarette -- without actually asserting it. &quot;What makes the coffee analogy very powerful is that they have in a sense established the safety position for Next,&quot; adds Mr. Ries.    Philip Morris's tack with Next also is similar to the way it introduced Merit and the concept of low tar in the 70s. Hal Grant, senior vice president of marketing at tobacco concern Liggett Group Inc., describes the Next campaign as &quot;really a kind of regurgitation of Merit.&quot; He adds: &quot;This is newsworthy not image advertising: You don't see a cowboy riding across the plains.&quot; (What you do see is a pack of Next cigarettes.) By keeping Next's message short -- and simple -- Philip Morris has avoided the mistakes RJR Nabisco Inc. made last year, when it introduced its now-defunct smokeless cigarette called Premier. Wordy copy explaining Premier, a clever contraption that delivered nicotine but no tar, proved just as confusing to consumers as the product.    But Philip Morris faces other challenges. Some industry critics warn the use of the word &quot;de-nicotined&quot; is problematic and could draw Federal Trade Commission scrutiny. At issue is whether consumers interpret it to mean no nicotine or so little nicotine that there are no health risks involved. &quot;This word is potentially misleading,&quot; says Cliff Douglas, assistant director of the Coalition on Smoking or Health. &quot;Some consumers will consider the product to be safe or safer than other tobacco products.&quot;    (In fact, Next has 0.1 milligrams of nicotine, the same amount as in Carlton and Now. But Next contains significantly higher levels of tar.)    Marketers also question Next's focus on the issue of choice in the ad copy. Some ads boast that the brand &quot;offers smokers a choice they have never had.&quot; Others declare: &quot;The Next choice is yours.&quot; But an ad man for a rival tobacco company cautions: &quot;If you are a smoker worried about tar and nicotine and you are invited to make choices, your next choice may be to quit altogether.&quot;    In any event, Philip Morris clearly believes it has a winner on its hands. Distributors in the cities where the brand is being tested say the company is sparing no expense to launch the product, even by its own lavish standards. As an incentive for distributors to take on the brand, Philip Morris is paying them $60 a case -- double the industry's standard rate. Even more unusual, salespeople are getting paid a handsome 20 cents for every carton they sell.    At Geo. Canalos Inc., Dennis Grahl, vice president of merchandising, says he hasn't even begun giving his Toledo-area customers introductory &quot;buy one, get one free&quot; deals, but has already had to reorder Next three times. &quot;I think Philip Morris is on to something,&quot; he says.    Greg Moses, a two-pack-a-day Cambridge Lights smoker in Sandusky, Ohio, who has sampled Next, agrees. &quot;Carltons and Now are like sucking on air,&quot; Mr. Moses says. &quot;These Nexts have a flavor and that's what a smoker wants.&quot;    ---   Ad Notes. . . .
