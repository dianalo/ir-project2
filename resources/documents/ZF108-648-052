S. and Japanese suppliers fromcapturing any more of the market?andM;&quot;The [European] Community shall adopt measures with the aim of progressivelyestablishing the internal market over a period expiring on 31 December1992.... The internal market shall comprise an area without internalfrontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capitalis ensured in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty.andP;  &quot;andM;Those words, from the treaty establishing the European Economic Community,signal the creation of the world's largest market for information technology.andO;On january 1, 1993, the 12 member nations of the European Community willcreate what is often called the United States of Europe.andP;  Under EEC rules,trade barriers between nations will be as lax as barriers between New Yorkand Connecticut.andP;  This internal market will be the largest integratedeconomic area in the world, with more than 320 million consumers and a grossdomestic product of some $5 trillion.andM;Moreover, the EEC sees information technology as an integral part of a UnitedEurope.andP;  The Single European Act that decreed the establishment of aninternal market also designated the creation of a &quot;European technologicalcommunity&quot; as one of the goals of Community policy.andM;But the community may find it has less and less control over the definitionof Europe in the 1990s.andP;  The dramatic events of the past year in EasternEurope, such as the impending reunification of Germany, have made theContinent a much larger economic force to be reckoned with.andP;  The relaxationof trade restrictions with the East Bloc, particularly on technology, leavesforecasters with a question mark for the future of the entire continent.andM;The only certainty here is that demand for information technology will grow;by how much is anyone's guess.andP;  Most market forecasts do assume that growthin sales of computer, telecommunications and office automation equipment inEurope will outpace that of the United States, just as it has over the pasttwo years.andM;Europe already accounts for 30% of the world's spending on informationtechnology, to the United States (40%) and well ahead of japan (I 5%),according to the EEC.andP;  While demand in the United States has been sluggish atbest in the last two years, Europe's thirst for computer equipment hascontinued to surge.andP;  In fact, several U.S.andP;  computer suppliers have been morethan candid in admitting that their European sales were the only factor thatkept them in the black last year.andP;  There are some indications that Europeandemand may slow this year.andP;  Reasons for the slowdown include somesluggishness in major economies such as Britain and France, as well as a risein interest rates.andP;  But suppliers are still certain that European demand forcomputers will outpace that of the United States.andP;  Vittorio Cassoni, managingdirector of Italy's Ing.andP;  C. Olivetti andamp; Co., even predicts that computerbuying in Europe will not follow the U.S.andP;  pattern of steep peaks and valleysin orders.andM;The Single-Market Bonanza The freeing up of trade restrictions is the drivingforce behind Europe's demand for information technology.andP;  An EEC-commissionedstudy known as the Cecchini Report estimates that the total economic benefitor the 1993 changes will be around $200 billion, leading to the creation ofsome 2 million new jobs.andM;Banks, accounting firms and other financial services companies are expectedto be the first European industries to attempt to cash in on the potentialeconomic bonanza promised by the single market.andP;  Once strictly nationalinstitutions are already opening branch offices throughout Europe, addingpersonnel and updating operations so that they can more effectively competeon an international scale.andP;  Manufacturers, also aware that they must expandbeyond national boundaries in order to compete, are investing in new plantsand offices.andP;  All this expansion is universally assumed to translate intomore computer purchases, software upgrades and data communicationsimprovements.andM;&quot;The technological preparations for the common internal market haveunmistakably begun,&quot; says Francois Salle, president of the EuropeanAssociation of Manufacturers of Business Machines and Information Technology(Eurobit).andP;  &quot;Investments involve future-oriented business decisions based onlong-term perspectives, so it is only too understandable that investments inplant come out on top in the forecasts of economic expansion.&quot; The problemfor European information technology suppliers, however, is how to get alarger piece of that investment.andP;  The EEC estimates that European suppliersonly account for 24% of the world's computer production.andP;  That is not enoughto keep them in the black.andP;  The British Computer Society even predicts thatthe EEC's trade deficit in information technology will increase from $12billion dollars in 1989 to  17 billion by 1995.andM;What's driving the deficit upward is that more European users are buyingU.S.- or Japanese-made information systems than European suppliers are ableto export.andP;  Although most European countries do support a so-called nationalchampion-a native supplier that sells lots of computers at home and virtuallynone across the border-that is hardly enough to compensate for the amount ofbusiness IBM and other foreign suppliers do in the region.andM;Siemens AG of West Germany, the largest information technology supplierheadquartered in Europe, is a classic national champion.andP;  About 70% of the$3.2 billion in revenue generated last year by its Data and InformationSystems Division came from within West Germany.andP;  Another 2% came from therest of Europe.andP;  U.S.-owned IBM, on the other hand, produced nearly 35% ofits $62.7 billion in 1989 revenue by selling systems in Europe.andP;  Such sizemakes IBM the biggest information technology supplier in every Europeancountry in which it does business.andM;Europe's native information technology suppliers are even further behind whenit comes to innovation.andP;  Although the region's computer scientists areconsidered among the best in the world, there have been no significantcommercial breakthroughs in computers from Europe.andP;  Europe cannot boast of ahomegrown Apple Computer Inc.andM;&quot;The U.S.andP;  leads in computers, software and services and in some areas ofindustrial automation,&quot; Eurobit stated in a briefing paper for the EEC.andO;Japan leads in components, consumer electronics and some office products,while Europe is third except in telecommunications and software andservices.&quot; Grow or Be GoneandM;European suppliers don't have many choices these days.andP;  Broad-based suppliersintent on surviving through the 1990s must merge, cooperate and pay attentionto opportunities in Eastern Europe.andP;  If they don't, they're  likely to be outof the information systems business.andP;  Niche suppliers must focus on creatingvalue in software and services.andM;Groupe Bull SA of France, for example, has turned itself into one of theworld's leading suppliers of personal computers by acquiring Zenith DataSystems Corp. The acquisition, which took place last year, is part of a grandstrategy by Bull.andP;  The key to the company's growth, says company chairmanFrancis Lorenz, is increasing its reach into the European market before thechanges of 1993 go into effect.andP;  Two-thirds of Bull's revenues already comefrom outside France.andM;Another champion, Siemens, decided to increase its clout by acquiring itslargest West German competitor, Nixdorf Computer AG.andP;  The merger creates anenterprise that in 1988 generated  4 billion in information systems revenues.andM;More mergers among European information technology suppliers are expectedduring the next five years.andP;  Some analysts speculate that only three largeEuropean groups will exist in 1995-Siemens, Bull and an Olivetti combination.andO;Few expect Finland's Oy Nokia, Norway's Norsk Data AS, Great Britain'sAmstrad PLC and the Netherlands' NV Philips' GL to still be independent.andO;Olivetti has already announced that it is holding talks on possiblecooperation with NV Philips as part of &quot;a stage of diffused negotiations witha number of European companies for other possibilities of collaboration.&quot;andO;Britain's STC has spent the past year looking for a foreign partner for itsInternational Computers Ltd. (ICL) subsidiary.andM;Joint research ventures also are popular in Europe.andP;  They give suppliers thecollective clout to back the kinds of massive research projects thatindividual companies in the United States and Japan can fund on their own.andO;The EEC is a big proponent of such joint ventures, allocating nearly half ofits research budget for information technology projects.andP;  Two of its betterknown efforts are the European Strategic Program for Research in InformationTechnologies (ESPRIT), which covers basic research and development ininformation technology, and RACE, for work aimed at integrated, broadbandcommunication.andM;But, to date, only one commercial product has evolved from any of theseventures-the transputer microchip, manufactured by Inmos of Britain.andP;  Thetransputer, introduced five years ago, offers twice the speed of IntelCorp.'s 80386, has four communications channels and, for under $10,000, canbe configured into a desktop computer, giving it more power than a DigitalVAX 8000 minicomputer.andP;  Unfortunately, a lack of software stunted thetransputer microchip's growth, and now Intel's i860 superchip can outperformit.andM;So, bigger companies and bigger research budgets may not necessarilytranslate into bigger market share for the European players.andP;  &quot;The ability tosell in foreign markets depends very much on the resources you have-theability to recruit staff,&quot; says Jerry Sanders, an independent computerconsultant in London.andP;  The biggest beneficiaries of a single common market inEurope, he believes, will be suppliers that are farthest away from Europe,have been established for 10 years or more and already know how to trade inseveral markets-in other words, U.S.andP;  companies.andP;  &quot;The irony is that, ofcourse, in America they've never really distinguished between individualcountries.andP;  Americans have been thinking about Europe as a single market fora long time,&quot; he says.andM;Software and Services ShineandM;All is not gloom and doom for native European suppliers.andP;  They do enjoy anadvantage in one critical arena: software and services.andP;  U.S.-based suppliershave little presence in the $20 billion European software and servicesmarket, which is expected to grow 20% by 1992.andP;  By then, European users willbe spending 60% of their information technology dollars on software and only40% on hardware, predicts Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. Analysts at the New York Citybrokerage firm say the ratio today stands at 409o' software, 60% hardware.andM;The largest independent software and services company in Europe now is CapGemini Sogeti of France.andP;  But its $1.1 billion in revenues still representonly 5% of the total European market, leaving plenty of room for growth byother EEC native suppliers.andM;Companies that call Brussels, Milan, Paris and other Continental sites homealso have something else going for them in software: UNIX.andP;  Europeans haveembraced the ATandamp;T operating system and just about every other open systemsstandard as a way of avoiding dominance by U.S.andP;  suppliers.andP;  Thus far, U.S.andO;suppliers have mostly sold proprietary systems to European users.andM;San Jose-based market research firm Dataquest Inc. predicts UNIX-relatedsales of software and systems will account for 20% of all informationtechnology spending in Europe by 1992-up from 10% today.andP;  he UNIX growth ratewithin each [category of computer] is greater than the overall segment growthrate,&quot; observes Jane Doorly, a Dataquest analyst.andM;But UNIX carries its own price-one that shows on the bottom lines ofcompanies selling UNIX-based systems.andP;  Because anyone can license thestandard from ATandamp;T, UNIX spawns competitive pricing.andP;  Because it's new, UNIXrequires suppliers to invest huge sums of money in software development andon features that help their UNIX solutions stand out in the marketplace.andM;Bull expects profit margins on systems to drop as much as 15% as customersmove to UNIX.andP;  &quot;We are committed to standards, and that doesn't make an easysituation,&quot;  says Didier Ruffat, president of Bull's internationaloperations.andP;  His company, for example, sold 39% more UNIX-based systems in1989 than in 1988 in West Germany, but revenues from those sales increasedonly 21%.andP;  &quot;I don't expect a high growth rate [in revenues] for the next fewyears,&quot; Ruffat says.andM;What Hand Will the East Bloc Deal?andM;The wildest wildcard in Europe isn't UNIX, however; it's Eastern Europe.andP;  Theadvent of democracy in the ]East Bloc has sent the EEC scrambling for aproper response, and that response is to treat the largest new market in theworld as a trading partner like any other.andP;  The East Bloc is expected to havea tremendous appetite for information technology as it hastens to establish amarket economy and catch up with the West in everything from factoryautomation to telephone service.andM;&quot;There is a great need for modernization of the infrastructure in thesecountries, and at the heart of this modernization is information technology,&quot;says Cliff Clarke, international trade policy manager for Digital.andP;  Theworld's No.andP;  2 computer maker has just invested $2 million on a joint ventureto sell computers in Hungary, with the realistic expectation that it may notpay dividends for some time.andP;  Most experts are of the belief that it will befive to 10 years before such ventures could hope to turn a profit.andP;  &quot;We seeenormous potential demand,&quot; Clarke explains, &quot;and we are positioningourselves for it now.andP;  &quot;andM;Information technology already gets some credit for the revolution in EasternEurope.andP;  &quot;Technology has made it possible,&quot; says U.S.andP;  Commerce SecretaryRobert Mosbacher'.andP;  [Communist regimes] were transcended by people power,based by telefax and videotape.&quot;andM;Now the people of these nations want to get their hands on as much technologyas they can.andP;  Eastern Europe is expected to spend $30 billion dollars ontelecommunications equipment by the year 2000-not far below the UnitedStates.andP;  And that estimate may be conservative.andP;  West German Post MinisterChritian Schwarz-Schilling says $40 billion to $60 billion must be investedin East Germany's telecommunications system, with its 25- to 60-year-oldpublic switches, to bring it up to West German standards.andP;  &quot;This will remainthe most serious problem for the next two years&quot; in merging the two Germanys,he says.andM;The Soviet Union also has ambitious plans for it antiquatedtelecommunications system.andP;  Moscow officials want to increase the number oftelephones in the country from 40 million today to 100 million by 2005.andP;  Atthe same time, they want to immerse Soviet society in computers-part of anambitious pro gram called &quot;informatization.&quot;andM;The Soviets currently have 200,000 personal computers-one for every 1,500citizens in a country whose population is 300 million people.andP;  The UnitedStates has about 38 million PCs--one for every seven of its 260 millionpeople.andM;Most analysts see the East Bloc turning to Western European suppliers.-notU.S.andP;  or japanese companies-to help meet its computer needs.andP;  The reasons aremany: partly because of proximity; partly because of the existingrelationship between the regions; partly because U.S.andP;  companies are morereluctant to commit themselves to the long-term investments required of suchtrade; partly because o the problems of currency translation-but mostlybecause of CoCom.andP;  Will Trade Restrictions Ease?andM;For 30 years, The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls(CoCom)-whose members include the major economic powers except Japan andAustralia-has been setting restrictions on technology exports to the EastBloc in order to prevent military equipment from reaching the Soviets.andP;  Theend of the Cold War has brought calls for the end of technology restrictionsfrom virtually all members of CoCom-except the United States.andP;  AlthoughWashington is expected to agree to relax trade restrictions withCzechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania, U.S.andP;  officialsclearly state that the Soviet Union will still be off limits, to a largedegree.andP;  &quot;We are not going to turn around and just give the Soviet militarythe opportunity to catch up with us, &quot; Mosbacher says.andM;The United States' hard-line attitude is forcing U.S.andP;  information technologysuppliers to move slowly with regard to the East Bloc, giving WesternEuropean rivals a chance to capitalize on an already existing tradeadvantage.andP;  The East Bloc could overtake North America as the EEC's largestexport market by the year 2000.andM;The East Bloc has a precious information technology resource to trade of itsown-expertise in software development.andP;  Soviet and other East Blocprogrammers are generally recognized as excellent, despite having to workwith ancient technology tools.andP;  witness the sophistication and success ofTetris, currently one of the best-selling computer games in the UnitedStates.andP;  Designed by Soviet programmer Alexey Pazhitnov, it's the firstRussian computer game to enter the U.S.andP;  market.andP;  Russian-designed Pcsoftware packages include a time planner/project management program, amacroeconomics modeler, a database for TV schedules and a word-processingprogram similar to WordStar that includes a Russian-language thesaurus.andM;In addition to Digital's ventures in Hungary, there is some interest, albeitcautious, from U.S.andP;  information technology suppliers and retailers in theEast Bloc.andP;  Computerland Corp.andP;  just opened the first computer store inMoscow, and various companies are setting up joint ventures to marketproducts in the region.andP;  &quot;We will be selling there in a significant way in amatter of years,&quot; promises Dean Morton, chief operating officer ofHewlett-Packard Co. He boasts that his Palo Alto company has had an office inthe Soviet Union since 1969; the office now has 65 HP employees.andM;Trade experts are convinced this activity will increase, particularlybecause, as borders become free, trade barriers will become meaningless.andO;&quot;It's becoming very difficult to police CoCom,&quot; says Ambassador BradleyHolmes, director of the U.S.andP;  State Department's Bureau of InternationalCommunications and Information Policy.andP;  &quot;But I'm sure you will continue tosee substantial relaxation [of CoCom rules].andP;  As technology changes, theprocess of review will change as well.&quot;andM;Change, indeed, is the watchword for users and suppliers of informationtechnology in Europe.andP;  Trade and political barriers are disappearing.andP;  Nativesuppliers are  consolidating.andP;  Technologies are shifting.andP;  Whether Europe'shigh and mighty-Bull, Cap Gemini, Olivetti, Siemetis-can change fast enoughwith the times to keep their U.S.andP;  and Japanese competitors in check is aquestion that will be answered in the next few years.andM;Catherine Barnat is a freelance writer based in London.andM;European companies with the best IS revenues for 1989andM;EUROPEAN            WORLD                        IS REVENUESandM;RANK             RANK          COMPANY        ($ MILLIONS)andM;1             8           Groupe Bull     6,465.4andM;2             9           Siemens         6,010.6andM;3           10            Olivetti        5,573.3andM;4           18            NV Philips      2,814.8andM;5           19            Nixdorf         2,792.6andM;6           22            STC             2,643.4andM;7           28            Memorex         2,056.6andM;8           32            Alcatel         1,800.3andM;9           46            Nokia           1,191.9andM;10             48            Cap Gemini      1,103.4andM;1 1            54            Mannesmann        819.1andM;12             59            Amstrad           717.0andM;13             62            British Telecom   692.5andM;14             64            Finsiel           662.5andM;15             68            Racal             573.9andM;16             69            Comparex          566.0andM;17             83            SD-Scicon         431.5andM;18             89            Sligos            400.7andM;19             95            Sema Group        378.6andM;20             99            Norsk Data        358.1andM;21             109           Logica            314.0andM;22             114           Software AG       294.0andM;23             118           GSI               277.1andM;The European companies with the most IS sales outside their home marketsandM;1989                 IS REVENUESandM;RANK      COMPANY     N.
