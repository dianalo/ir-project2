The Solar Power Plant withConcentrating Mirrors is one of the methods of conversion of solar energyin electricity. It has been proven that the major investment cost percentageof solar plants with tracking heliostats is the Heliostat Structure whichconsists mainly of reflector surfaces, heliostat support constructionsand tracking mechanism. The investigations have been performed for minimizingthe number of mobile parts in Reflecting and Focusing area for a low-costalternative to the heliostat systems, in Ege University Solar EnergyInstitute.</TEXT></DOC>
