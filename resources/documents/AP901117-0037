Group members and a former manager claimed record companyexecutives at Arista knew the dreadlocked duo was faking it, evenbefore the Grammy Awards ceremony in February.   German producer Frank Farian this week confirmed longstandingrumors the pair, Robert Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan, did not sing onthe multi-platinum ``Girl You Know It's True'' album. Farian saidthe two lip-synced for videos and live appearances.   But Pilatus told the Los Angeles Times on Friday the pair hadalready admitted the truth to Clive Davis, president of Arista.   ``We told Clive Davis. We told Sandy Gallin (a Hollywood talentmanager). We told everybody six months before the Grammy Awards,''Pilatus said.   Milli Vanilli's former manager, Todd Headlee, said their phonyrecording was common knowledge at the record company.   ``Everyone at Arista who worked closely with the group waswalking on eggshells before the Grammy lip-sync performance lastFebruary,'' Headlee told the Times.   ``When they walked off the stage clutching the trophy, Iremember thinking to myself that they may not have deserved theGrammy for their performance, but they sure as hell did deserve anOscar,'' Headlee added.   Roy Lott, executive vice president of Arista, denied theentertainers' account.   ``There is now way that anyone ever could have know whether theysang or not,'' Lott said. ``We are merely a distributor of theirrecords. Rob and Fab and Frank assured us that they sang on therecord.''   A call seeking comment from Davis on Friday night was notreturned.   The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences will decidenext month whether to strip the Grammy Award for Best New Artist.   ``It was fraud and we're appalled by it,'' NARAS PresidentMichael Greene said Friday. ``But our hearts go out to these twoguys, because they're very easy targets.''   The NARAS awards subcommittee will meet Dec. 5 in New York todiscuss revoking the award and the board of trustees will meetlater that month to make a final decision. If the Grammy is revokedit would mark the first such action taken in the academy's 33-yearhistory.   Casey Kasem, host of the national radio program, Casey's Top 40,said today Milli Vanilli should be ``forgiven.''   ``In all fairness you have to recognize that we all, at one timeor another, have been sucked into a situation we regret,'' Kasemsaid from Washington D.C. in a telephone interview with theAssociated Press.   ``The album was a major seller and loved by a lot of people,''Kasem said. ``They (Milli Vanilli) know in their hearts they couldhave done that but didn't have the opportunity.''   Meanwhile, angry fans turned in their ``Milli Vanilli''recordings Friday and radio stations vowed to pull the pop duo offthe air.   ``I think they're dirty scumbuckets,'' said 9-year-old KatieDickman of Richmond, Ind. ``I used to like them, but not now.''   Radio station WLOL-FM in Minneapolis said it was ``Milli VanilliFree'' and would no longer play the album.   Farian says he was forced to go public with the revelations whenthe boys told him they wanted to sing on the follow-up record.   ``I said, `No. I don't go for that.' Sure, they have a voice,but that's not really what I want to use on my records,'' Fariansaid Wednesday.   In a statement Thursday, the two said they ``have been ready,willing and able to record our own vocals and have been preventedby Frank Farian from doing so.''</TEXT></DOC>
