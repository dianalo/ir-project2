Swing, 54, has previously served as ambassador to the Congo andLiberia. In South Africa, he would replace Ambassador EdwardPerkins, who is returning home to become director general of theForeign Service. Swing is now deputy director in that office.   The U.S. officials, insisting on anonymity, also said Bush isexpected to name conservative columnist Smith Hempstone asambassador to Kenya.   The Nairobi post had been expected to go to career diplomatPrinceton Lyman, now ambassador to Nigeria, but the administrationdecided to send a political appointee to Kenya, the officials said.   Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said theadministration would invite the leader of South Africa's rulingNational Party, Frederick W. de Klerk, to visit.   De Klerk is expected to succeed South Africa President P.W.Botha once parliamentary elections are held in September.   Asked about such a visit, State Department deputy spokesmanRichard Boucher said the United States is in touch with the SouthAfrican government ``regarding possible meetings andconsultations'' with de Klerk.   He said the administration is planning to consult widely withboth black and white South Africans and to solicit viewpointsacross the South African political spectrum.   More than 30 years have passed since a South African president,prime minister or National Party leader has come to the UnitedStates.   A commentary aired on South Africa's state-run radio, reportedin Wednesday's edition of The Washington Post, said a visit by deKlerk ``would be an important breakthrough'' in U.S.-South Africanrelations.   The Post quoted a State Department official as saying that deKlerk is ``obviously a very important person for us to be talkingto'' if serious negotiations between the races in South Africa areto be renewed.   Relations between the United States and South Africa souredduring the Reagan administration because of economic sanctionsimposed by Congress.   But the commentary noted that President Bush, like Reagan, is astrong opponent of further sanctions against South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
