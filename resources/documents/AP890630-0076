The court prolonged the drama surrounding its most closelywatched case of the 1980s by postponing until Monday any word in anabortion dispute from Missouri.   In it, the justices are being asked to reverse the court's 1973decision legalizing abortion.   Scores of partisans who had gathered on the court building'sfront steps voiced disappointment Thursday.   Olivia Gans of the National Right to Life Committee said, ``It isdifficult to wait ... but we remain optimistic.''   Faye Wattleton, president of Planned Parenthood, said furtherdelay would be ``an indication of the turmoil that this court iswilling to create in this country.''   Randall Terry, national director of an anti-abortion group calledOperation Rescue, said, ``If I was a Supreme Court justice, I wouldthrow the decision off the airplane as I was leaving the country.''   Before beginning its three-month summer recess, the court mustdeal with three cases awaiting decision.   In each, the court must announce a decision or order the casereargued. If it chooses the latter course, a new round of argumentswould be held during the court term that begins in October, withannouncement of a decision likely in 1990.   Court officials refused all comment on the prospect of a Mondaydecision in the Missouri case, which is called Webster vs.Reproductive Health Services. And in the absence of any hard facts,rumors abounded.   ABC News reported that Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who wrote thecourt's 1973 decision, may have asked Chief Justice William H.Rehnquist for more time to complete ``a bitter opinion'' in theWebster case.   However, a Supreme Court source who spoke only on condition onanonymity told The Associated Press today that Blackmun's ``writingis not holding things up.''   Abortion-rights advocates fear the court will order the Missouricase reargued next term and do so in a way that signals the justicesare contemplating a major retreat from the 1973 ruling in Roe vs.Wade.   In that decision, the court said women have a constitutionalright to abortion.   If reargument is ordered, the court also could agree to review upto three other abortion disputes pending before the justices. Thatwould be read by some as a tip-off the court was on the verge of asweeping ruling.   The three cases _ from Illinois, Ohio and Minnesota _ all involvestate regulations making abortions harder to get.   The justices met behind closed doors in a regularly scheduledconference Thursday after their public session.   Attorney General William Webster said Thursday in Jefferson City,Mo., he was not reading anything into the delay. Webster, who arguedin favor of upholding the Missouri law, said, ``Hope springseternal. Anybody who wants it to come to a certain way can writeinto this delay great optimism.''   Roe vs. Wade itself was a case that had to be argued twice beforea decision was announced. The court hears arguments in about 150cases each term, and since 1977 has held over at least one case eachyear for reargument the following term.   The 1973 ruling said a woman's decision to have an abortionduring the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her andher doctor. It said states may regulate abortions during the secondtrimester only to protect the woman's health, and may take steps toprotect fetal life in the third trimester.   State authority to regulate abortions after the first trimesterwas not made absolute, however.   In the past decade, about 1.5 million legal abortions have beenperformed each year.   If Roe vs. Wade were reversed, states would be free tostringently regulate _ or even outlaw _ abortion.   In the two decisions the court did announce Thursday, it:   _Gave public officials more authority to ban advertising andsales pitches _ including ``Tupperware parties'' in collegedormitories. The 6-3 ruling in a New York case significantly limitedcommercial free speech.   _Limited, in a case from Washington state, the power of Indiantribes to control, through tribal zoning laws, the use of land ownedby non-Indians within a reservation's boundaries.   The two other cases in which decisions are pending include animportant church-state dispute from Pittsburgh focusing on holidaydisplays of a Christmas Nativity scene and a Hanukkah menorah atgovernment buildings.   The court also is expected to decide in a case from Arkansas andFlorida whether a business that successfully challenges a state taxas unconstitutional is entitled to be refunded the money it paidbefore the tax was invalidated.</TEXT></DOC>
