It is shown that an increase in the ultimate strength and higherarrangement of strain curves are observed beginning with a certain valueof hydrostatic pressure under compression. Several different types ofcoatings have been tested under compression and none of them gave a reliableprotection against of oil in pores and cracks of a specimen as a resultof which the strength values in this case are lower that under atmosphericpressure.</TEXT></DOC>
