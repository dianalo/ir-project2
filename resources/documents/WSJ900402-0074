Separately, the U.S. and Japan have agreed to steps tofurther open the Japanese market to foreigntelecommunications goods and services, and are close toanother market-opening accord on trade in satellites, tradeofficials said.</LP><TEXT>   One of Japan's most significant reform proposals, sayJapanese officials, will likely be an overhaul of thelarge-scale retail-store law, which protects politicallyinfluential mom-and-pop storeowners but blocks many bigstores from opening.   Toshio Yamaguchi, the head of the ruling LiberalDemocratic Party committee drafting Japan's strategy for thebilateral structural talks, said in a Japanese televisioninterview Sunday that government leaders were consideringendorsing repeal of the law in large cities.   The U.S. says the law is unfair because new Japanesestores can open branches in America almost immediately, butnew stores in Japan can be forced to wait as long as 10years. U.S. negotiators also say large stores, evenJapanese-owned, are more likely to carry imported goods.   Mr. Yamaguchi also said Japan would probably respond toU.S. demands for increased public spending by publicizing howmuch it is planning to spend on various projects alreadybudgeted, such as sewerage systems and public parks. The U.S.wants Japan to spend more, because macroeconomic theorysuggests Japan's unusually high savings rate contributes toits huge trade surplus, and increased public spending wouldreduce national savings.   Other Japanese government officials said a third majorgovernment proposal would be to revise the anti-monopoly lawby, among other things, increasing the monetary penalty forviolations. The U.S. has argued that lax antitrustenforcement has damped foreign competition.   U.S. and Japanese officials are expected to work out,perhaps as soon as tomorrow, an interim report on theyear-long Structural Impediments Initiative discussions aimedat clearing away some of the underlying causes of the $49billion bilateral trade imbalance. A final report isscheduled for completion by July.   Although most of the attention has focused on Japan, theU.S. is also supposed to propose changes in its economicstructure, including measures to encourage increased savingsand investment.   Japan was the main subject of the National Trade Estimatesreport released Friday by the White House traderepresentative's office. The report will be the basis for theBush administration's decision -- expected at the end ofApril -- on which countries to target under the tough Super301 provision of its 1988 trade act. The Super 301 provisionrequires the administration to identify and try to resolveparticularly egregious trade barriers, with the threat oftrade retaliation if those talks are unsuccessful.   The U.S. is particularly anxious to ensure that itshi-technology industries aren't hurt by foreign tradepractices. Thus, last year, Japan's satellite andsupercomputer trade practices were targeted under Super 301.This year, the National Trade Estimates adds amorphous metalsto its list of complaints against Japan, alleging that theU.S. patent holder, Allied-Signal Inc., has been unable tolicense production in Japan &quot;despite years of effort.&quot;   Late Friday, the two countries agreed on atelecommunications accord, just before a Saturday deadlinethat could have been the signal for U.S. trade retaliation.The accord involves network channel terminating equipment.   Network channel terminating equipment are modem-likedevices used to connect computers to digital communicationsnetworks. The Japanese market for these products is estimatedat $1 billion during the next five years, according toindustry estimates. Foreign companies have argued thatcertification procedures are used to discriminate againstthem in the Japanese telecommunications market.   The Japanese also agreed to resolve the problems forforeign companies that arise out of the distinction thatJapan makes in its telecommunications certificationprocedures, a senior U.S. official said.   The countries agreed to implement the liberalizationmeasures within the next 120 days. Continuing bilateral talkson opening the Japanese satellite market have made &quot;progress&quot;and are set to resume next week, a U.S. trade official said.</TEXT></DOC>
