Secretary of State James A. Baker III told visiting West GermanForeign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher about the sales during aluncheon last week, said State Department spokeswoman MargaretTutwiler.   Genscher said he knew nothing about the incident, Ms. Tutwilersaid.   The company, to circumvent stricter West German export controls,bought the chemicals from a business in India, anotheradministration official said.   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined toname the West German company.   The diplomat in charge of the chemical acquisition was identifiedas Said Karim Ali Sobhani, an official of Iran's trade mission.   Ms. Tutwiler said it was understandable that West Germanofficials don't know about every sale by every West German company.She also said the United States was satisfied with the West Germanresponse, but doesn't view the case as closed.   News of the incident comes as Congress considers severalproposals to enact sanctions against nations and companies that sellchemical and biological weapons.   The proposed legislation was prompted by revelations last yearthat West German companies sold Libya equipment for production ofchemical weapons. West Germany tightened its export control laws asa result of the ensuing furor.   Iran and Iraq used chemical weapons during their nine-year warthat ended last year.   Use of the chemical weapons prompted the United States to joinwith its allies in seeking to halt sales of any chemicals that canbe used by Third World countries as weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
