Rowny said Monday.   ``We are calling for tough measures which will assure that wecan verify Soviet compliance,'' Rowny told the American Associationfor the Advancement of Science in Boston. The text of the speechwas released in Washington.   The Soviets, he said, can expedite progress on strategic armsreductions by abandoning their effort to link the reductions toAmerica's pursuit of Star Wars technology.   Rowny accused the Soviets of delaying tactics, which he said arejeopardizing reaching an agreement on strategic arms in time forPresident Reagan's meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachevin late spring or early summer.   ``They appear to believe delaying tactics will reward them witha START treaty imbalanced in their favor,'' Rowny said. ``I hopethey will recognize that their intransigence is only dimming hopesfor an agreement before the Moscow summit meeting.''   Even with the tough verification procedures approved two monthsago as part of the treaty banning medium-range missile, Rowny said,``it would be misleading to suggest we are on a roll toward a STARTagreement.''   ``We are concerned that the Soviets' heavy reliance on verylarge ICBMs may give them a sense of confidence that they couldgain a critical advantage by striking first,'' Rowny said.   By seeking a limit that permanently reduces both the number andthe proportion of intercontinental ballistic missiles in the Sovietarmory, he said, ``we are asking the Soviets in effect to renounceany motion that nuclear war is winnable, even if initiatedpre-emptively.''</TEXT></DOC>
