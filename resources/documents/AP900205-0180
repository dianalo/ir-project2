The only emergency media restriction still in force prohibitsphotographic or television coverage of political unrest unlesspolice permission is obtained.   Many of the restrictions repealed by de Klerk had been ignoredwith increasing frequency by South African and foreign journalists.These regulations either prohibited or restricted reports aboutunrest, security force action, general strikes or consumerboycotts, and political statements the government deemed subversive.   In addition to scrapping these regulations, de Klerk on Fridaylifted bans that had prohibited the local media from quotingmilitant government opponents.   Even before the emergency was declared in June 1986, SouthAfrica's media was subject to an array of restictive laws thatremain in effect. These restrict reporting about such topics asmational security, energy supplies and incidents in prisons.   During the emergency, several foreign journalists were expelledand several anti-apartheid newspapers were ordered to close formonths because of alleged violations of the restrictions.   In the past year, such actions have become rare, and thegovernment has been approving hundreds of visas for foreignjournalists to come on temporary visits to cover the expectedrelease of jailed African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela.</TEXT></DOC>
