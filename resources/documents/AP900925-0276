The memorandum outlines Milken's personal background, businessactivities at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the nature of hisoffenses, a proposal to sentence him and a rebuttal to governmentcharges to which he hasn't pleaded guilty.</TEXT><HEAD>PERSONAL BACKGROUND</HEAD><TEXT>   Michael Milken's unusual talents and compassion became obviousat an early age. By the first grade, Michael could performcomplicated multiplications in his head, and he received thehighest grades in his classes.   . . . Michael's work ethic also became evident at an early age.Beginnning at the age of 10, Michael helped in his father'saccounting office - at first, sorting checks and performingministerial functions; later, reconciling checkbooks and assistingin the preparation of tax returns.   . . . By the time Michael was 30, he had earned vast sums ofmoney. But as everyone who knows him confirms, the accumulation ofmoney and material goods has never motivated Michael.   . . . Until the publicity surrounding this investigation began,not even his closest friends and colleagues had any idea of theextent of his wealth or, for that matter, the vast sums of moneyMichael gave away to charities. In stark contrast to the ``rich andfamous'' lifestyles led by other financiers, Michael eschewedconspicuous consumption. He lives in a comfortable but notextravagant home in Encino . . . His children receive a weeklyallowance. He prefers to spend his evenings with his family.   . . . Michael is actively involved in all aspects of hischildren's life. He helps his children with their homework. Herarely misses a school function or a doctor's appointment. Michaelhas even coached his boys' basketball teams.   . . . As the court can well imagine, Michael's greatestpunishment is his knowledge that, by virtue of his offenses, hischildren have suffered greatly and are living with the nightmarethat they may become separated from their father who has been acontinual presence throughout their lives and upon whom they aredeeply dependent.   . . . Michael Milken will live for the rest of his life with theknowledge that he has inflicted enormous emotional and physicalpain upon his wife and his children whom he loves more thananything else in the world. For him, this punishment is more severethan any this court could possibly impose.   . . . Michael has immersed himself in philanthropy, havingvolunteered thousands of hours to assist charities and communityorganizations around the world.   . . . Michael Milken's lifetime of charitable work cannot negatehis criminal conduct. But it can serve to underscore that hisoffenses stand in sharp contrast to the philanthropic values he hasdisplayed throughout his life.</TEXT><HEAD>HIS HARD WORK</HEAD><TEXT>   Michael strove, through the use of innovative capitalstructures, to provide financing to companies previously deniedaccess to capital. The sincerity of Michael's business beliefs andthe goals he set for himself are central to an understanding ofboth the offender and the context in which the offenses occurred.   . . . By 1985, Michael's business day was devoted both tosupervising the numerous researchers, traders and salespersons inthe multibillion-dollar high-yield department and to talking on thephone and meeting with scores of customers and other Drexelemployees regarding the underwriting of millions of dollars of newsecurities. His day began at approximately 4:30 a.m. and ended atapproximately 7 p.m.   . . . Some have suggested that Michael Milken should be punishedless for his offenses than for his role in pioneering high-yieldfinance. Such suggestions are not only improper, they are misguidedas well. People are perfectly entitled to call high-yieldsecurities ``junk bonds'' just as they are free to call shareholderrights plans ``poison pills'' but that does not make eitherillegal.   . . . Michael Milken's high-yield business prospered long beforeDrexel ever financed a single hostile takeover. Michael was not inDrexel's mergers and acquisitions department, and did not suggesttargets for unsolicited takeovers. In fact, he often recommendedagainst such maneuvers.</TEXT><HEAD>NATURE OF HIS OFFENSES</HEAD><TEXT>   Michael should be sentenced based on the offenses to which hepleaded guilty. He should not be sentenced for crimes that he didnot commit. He should not be sentenced on charges for which thegovernment expressly has foregone prosecution in return for hisguilty plea.   . . . Although inexcusable, Michael's offenses (deletion) wereneither venal nor motivated by greed. He did not personally profitby them. They did not involve trading securities on the basis ofinside information. Nor did these offenses infect the core of hisbusiness.   . . . Moreover, the majority of offenses to which Michaelpleaded guilty had rarely, if ever, been subject to criminalprosecution at the time of Michael's acts.   . . . While Michael aided and abetted in deferring payment oftaxes, Michael himself has never improperly deferred or evaded anytaxes that he owed. To the contrary, from 1984 through 1988,Michael paid approximately $750 million federal and state incometaxes.   . . . Michael today recognizes the gravity of his actions. Heunderstands that no one - especiallt someone in a position ofleadership and trust - can ever decide that it is permissible tocommit acts, no matter what one's motivation may be, that violatethe law. Michael Milken is a changed person. He will be tormentedfor the remainder of his life by the realization that his familywas devastated, his reputation destroyed and his life's worktainted by virtue of his having committed these acts.</TEXT><HEAD>SENTENCING PROPOSAL</HEAD><TEXT>   If this court concludes that incarceration is required, we urgethat any period of confinement be brief - consistent with theprecedents in this district - and that it be served in a halfwayhouse or local facility (deletion).   . . . Based on the sentencing principles developed in thisdistrict, we propose that Michael Milken be sentenced to workfull-time with, and under the direct supervision and control of,the Los Angeles Police Department to develop and participate inspecific educational and vocational programs designed to combat theproblems of drugs, crime, unemployment and illiteracy threateningto destroy the lives of inner-city youth in Los Angeles.   . . . The proposed sentence fully satisfies the goals ofpunishment and general deterrence. Although the sentence imposed bythis court must serve to punish Michael for the crimes to which hehas pleaded guilty and must strive to deter others similarlysituated from committing these and similar crimes, the goals ofsentencing need not always be achieved through incarceration.   . . . The retributive purpose of punishment has also been servedin this case by Michael's agreement to pay a $200 million criminalfine and establish a $400 million civil settlement fund. Moreover,these unprecedented amounts are not the limit of Michael's economicexposure. His remaining assets are vulnerable to the more than 50civil lawsuits that already have been commenced against him andothers, seeking billions of dollars in damages. Michael may wellspend the remainder of this century defending these and futurelawsuits.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
