(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mining claims valued up to $400 millionmay be endangered by a pair of nesting spotted owls, considered anendangered species by the state.   The rare owls are believed to inhabit the slopes above WellsCreek Canyon, where a Spokane mining company hopes to dig for goldand silver.   But Audubon Society officials see possible problems if thesighting of young owls means nests are nearby.   ``It just doesn't seem feasible (for mining) not to impact theowl,'' says Audubon staff member Chuck Sisco.   ``The spotted owl is a major issue, and we are bringing inbiologists to study this,'' said Wallace McGregor, president of themining company, Steelhead Resources Ltd.   McGregor and other company officials briefed government andenvironmental representatives Tuesday at the site of the GreatExcelsior Mine, opened at the turn of the century 12 miles south ofthe Canadian border.   Glacier, a hamlet consisting mainly of a ranger station and atavern, was where the 1935 film ``Call of the Wild'' starring ClarkGable and Loretta Young was filmed.   Geologists have made a total of 61 test borings into thevolcanic rock in Steelhead's 1,250-acre claim and have identifiedapproximately 160,000 ounces of gold and 10 million ounces ofsilver worth about $130 million at current prices.   McGregor says extensions of the known ore zone, as well as apotential for finding new deposits, could boost the value ofSteelhead's claims to $400 million.   He estimates the mine would be worked for 10 to 20 years with 50to 100 local people employed at any one time.   To begin operations, however, the miners must obtain 36 federaland state permits, undergo an environmental impact study and meet astill-undetermined list of county requirements.   McGregor estimated it would be two to four years before theoperation could begin.   Spotted owls, including young offspring, have been reported inthe area since the late 1970s, indicating there may be a nestsomeplace, such as the cavity of a rotting old tree, in the areawhere the pit miners would dig, said Brady Green, a wildlifebiologist with the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.   ``What we are trying to do is work with them (the miningcompany) the best we can until it is determined what they are goingto do (with the site) and then try and minimize the impact so wedon't further jeopardize it as spotted owl habitat,'' Green said.   The forest service has designated the region as a spotted owlhabitat area, but Cindy Correll, a mining specialist with the MountBaker Ranger District, said an 1872 law gives miners the right to``prospect, explore and develop valuable mineral deposits'' innational forests.   The spotted owl is not designated an endangered or threatenedspecies by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, although it is onthe forest supervisor's list of ``sensitive'' wildlife.   In Washington state, the spotted owl is considered endangered.While the state lacks authority to protect the bird's habitat infederal forests, Wildlife Department officials said the intentionalkilling of a spotted owl could result in criminal prosecution.   Tom Juelson, manager of non-game programs for the state WildlifeDepartment, said the problem could be hard to resolve if a nestwere found.   ``If it were an easy resolution, it would have been resolved,''he says. ``Those who have the mining permit have a great deal atstake. The spotted owl is an endangered species. These kinds ofconflicts don't lend themselves to an easy solution.''</TEXT></DOC>
