Edmund M. Kaufman, named by Wickes to head a company &quot;task force&quot; examining the complex problem, said &quot;a small number of people so far&quot; have been dismissed at the Floor Coverings division of Wickes's Collins andamp; Aikman unit.    But Mr. Kaufman, senior partner with the Los Angeles law firm of Irell andamp; Manella and a Wickes director, said it is &quot;premature&quot; to discuss how approximately $360 million of carpet might have been sold without meeting certain local flammability and smoke density tests.    Wickes learned of the problem only a week ago, he said, &quot;and our first priority was to make sure there wasn't any hazard out there.&quot;    He said the company is seeking to trace buyers of the carpeting, though he would only confirm one such major customer, the federal government. A spokesman for the General Services Administration in Washington, which purchases most carpeting for the federal government, said officials weren't available yesterday to comment on the disclosure by Wickes.    Wickes was the most active issue in American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, on exceptionally heavy volume of more than 7.6 million shares, and closed at $3.625 a share, down 37.5 cents.    As previously reported, the Collins andamp; Aikman unit, which Wickes acquired in January, marketed commercial-grade, polyvinyl chloride-backed carpet that didn't meet some flame and smoke tests specified by local building codes or customer standards. Wickes said it believes the carpeting is safe and meets the basic federal flammability standard. The retailer and manufacturer said it hasn't discovered any cases of the carpeting's causing the spread of a fire or fire-related injuries.    Because Collins andamp; Aikman is a major institutional carpet supplier, much of the estimated 30 million square yards of substandard carpeting sold during the 10-year period is likely to have been installed in hospitals, schools and other institutions that generally have strict flammability standards.    The question of Wickes's liability for a failure to meet carpeting standards is a particularly sticky one. Mr. Kaufman noted that Wickes and Collins andamp; Aikman, which produces the carpet at its Dalton, Ga., plant, have numerous insurers. But he said it isn't clear &quot;what specific coverages are applicable to this situation.&quot;    &quot;We are reviewing our insurance coverage, and it takes an expert to understand it all,&quot; Mr. Kaufman said.    He said it was too early to say whether Wickes's strategy might involve seeking waivers from customers who have bought the carpet.    Wickes's claim that the rolled and &quot;carpet tile&quot; product in question meets federal flammability standards probably will have little relevance in dealing with customers' claims against the company, according to safety specialists.    James Winger, a textile fiber specialist at the National Bureau of Standards center for fire research, said that local building codes normally require tests &quot;to determine whether the carpet would be the source of spreading for any existing fire.&quot; There isn't any federal building code, and the 1970 federal flame standard is designed simply to assure that carpet can't be ignited by a small fire source, he said. &quot;I don't know any local codes that specifically refer to that standard,&quot; Mr. Winger said.    The main test required by most local codes, which the Collins andamp; Aikman carpet apparently fails, involves exposure of a 2 1/2-foot by eight-inch carpet strip to an electrically heated panel sloping over the top of the specimen. The test measures how far the flame spreads down the horizontally positioned carpet once it is ignited by a small pilot flame.    Mr. Winger said he wasn't aware of major carpet-related flaming problems that have developed in fires studied over the past 10 years, though carpets once were considered a major source of fires' spreading.    Mr. Kaufman of the Wickes task force wouldn't discuss in detail how the carpet problem was discovered. But he said that &quot;initially the facts were developed at the divisional level&quot; and later presented to Wickes's management. &quot;It was discovered in a complex set of circumstances whereby a certain piece of carpeting was found not to have complied&quot; with some fire standards, Mr. Kaufman said.    He said that &quot;leading experts in fire and flammable materials&quot; have been consulted and are serving on the company task force, though he declined to identify the individuals involved. </TEXT></DOC>
