Paul Simon, silent in the South, lies inwait for Democratic rivals Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis as thepresidential campaign turns north to Illinois where Sen. Bob Doleis readying a Republican last stand against George Bush.   Jackson hopes to reap delegates and votes in Chicago, where helives, while Simon seeks strength from state Democratic leaders whoencouraged him to keep afloat his fading campaign effort.   The home-state candidates face a strong challenge from Dukakis,whose well-heeled and well-organized staff has scoured the statesince last fall and has slates in all districts. Dukakis willlikely hammer away at economic themes in a state struggling withplant closings and job losses.   Rep. Richard Gephardt is not expected to mount a major campaignin the state. He sees no hope of success, given Simon and Jackson'sbuilt-in strengths and Dukakis' substantial effort.   ``I think with muddled results (from Super Tuesday) and a strongfavorite son in Paul Simon, we're going to look at the state beyondthat, and that's Michigan,'' said spokesman Mark Johnson.   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of near-neighbor Tennessee plans to spendpart of the week in Illinois, as does former Sen. Gary Hart ofColorado,   On the Republican side, Sen. Dole, a Kansan who has done well inthe Midwest and calls Illinois ``friendly territory,'' has anothershot at farm votes.   However, Vice President Bush is backed by Gov. James Thompson,93 of 102 county leaders and other influential state leaders.   ``There are no areas we consider ourselves weak in,'' said EdMurnane, deputy campaign director.   Dole also has a strong state operation, with coordinators in allcounties and well-known delegate candidates, said campaign directorMark Schroeder. Dole's organization began shifting forces toIllinois even before Super Tuesday.   Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and former television evangelist PatRobertson were not expected to be major factors.   Illinois is a diverse state, with numerous ethnic groups,industrial centers, farms, big cities, small towns, professionalsand blue-collar workers.   ``Illinois is a microcosm of the nation,'' said Samuel Gove, apolitical scientist and director emeritus at the University ofIllinois' Institute of Government. ``A candidate who can do wellhere can do well nationally.''   More than 5.9 million residents are registered to vote inTuesday's primary _ the lowest number for any statewide electionsince 1982. The race is divided into a non-binding presidentialpreference, dubbed the ``beauty contest,'' and the selection ofdelegates pledged to a candidate or uncommitted.   Because of heavy emphasis on earlier races, the candidates havedevoted little time to Illinois, where 113 Democratic and 82 GOPdelegates will be chosen Tuesday. The remaining 85 will be selectedat party meetings.   During the next six days, however, candidates will crisscrossIllinois and burn up the airwaves with their messages. Dukakisaides, for example, have said they expect to spend about $500,000on TV advertising.   Simon, however, a first-term senator who has served ascongressman, state lawmaker and lieutenant governor, doesn't planany TV advertising here.   ``He shouldn't have to. He's run here his whole life,'' saidJerry Sinclair, Simon's Illinois political director. ``We're shortof dollars.''   Both Simon and Jackson have made strong showings in recent statepolls.   Simon, who is supported by many party leaders, has deniedspeculation he stayed in the race so Illinois delegates committedto him can attend the national convention.   ``The plan is to concentrate on Illinois and then the Midwestindustrial states, to keep accumulating delegates,'' Sinclair said.``The way it looks now, no one is going to get this thing on thefirst ballot. If it becomes more and more ... fragmented, whyshould Paul drop out?''   But Jack Van Der Slik, political studies professor at SangamonState University in Springfield, said, ``His votes are going to belower than before he bowed out of Super Tuesday. He's going to lookweak. That's going to be the coup de grace.''   Jackson, though, expects to do better than his 1984 showing of21 percent of Illinois' vote, said spokesman Frank Watkins.   Watkins said Jackson has delegate slates in 21 of 22congressional districts, compared with four in 1984. He saidJackson will fare well in Chicago, where 56 percent of the votersare black or Hispanic, and will expand his white base, as he has inVermont and Minnesota.   Van Der Slik, however, said, ``I think Jesse is much morevulnerable in this state. People have made up their minds abouthim. He was much more of a fresh face in a lot of those othersituations.''</TEXT></DOC>
