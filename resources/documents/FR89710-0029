Associated facilitiesinclude the expansion of the Barron and Apple River Substations to providespace to accommodate terminations of the new 161/69 kV line. Also, spacewill be provided at the Apple River Substation for the addition of a second161/69 kV 60 MVA transformer in the future. The proposed facilities willbe located in Polk and Barron Counties, Wisconsin. The Barron Substationis located about one-half mile south of the City of Barron in Section 33,Township 34 North, Range 12 West in the Barron Township, Barron County.The Apple River Substation is located about 2 miles southwest of the Cityof Range in Section 2, Township 33 North, Range 16 West in the LincolnTownship, Polk County. The proposed facilities will be built by the DairylandPower Cooperative (DPC) of La Crosse, Wisconsin.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>REA's Environmental Assessment(EA) and FONSI and DPC's Borrower's Environmental Report (BER) may be reviewedat the REA, Office of the Director, Northwest Area-Electric, Room 0230,South Agriculture Building, Washington, DC 20250, telephone (202) 382-1400;or at the Office of DPC, Mr. James W.

Copies of the BER, EA and FONSI can be obtained from eitherof the contacts listed above. All comments or questions should be directedto the REA contact.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>REA reviewed the BER submitted by DPCand determined that it represents an accurate assessment of the environmentalimpacts of the proposed project. The line consists of a 161/69 kV transmissionline approximately 43 kilometers (27 miles) in length and associated facilities.Associated facilities include the expansion of the 161 kV bus at BarronSubstation into a breaker-and-a-half scheme and expansion of the 161 kVbus at Apple River Substation to accommodate a new 161 kV line. DPC ata future date also intends to install a second 161/69 kV 60 MVA transformerat the Apple River Substation. The BER and EA adequately consider the potentialimpacts of the proposed project, and REA has concluded that approval ofthe project would not result in a major Federal action significantly affectingthe quality of the human environment. REA determined that the proposedproject will have no significant effect on air quality, water quality,floodplains, wetlands, important farmlands, prime rangelands or prime forestlands, Federal or State listed or proposed threatened or endangered speciesor their critical habitat, or any property listed or eligible for listingin the <T3>National Register of Historic Places. </T3>REA identified no othermatters of potential environmental concern related to the proposed project.Various alternatives to the proposed project were considered includingno action, rebuilding the existing Barron to Apple River 69 kV transmissionline, energy conservation, local generation, alternative voltage, alternativesources of power, alternative transmission route, and undergound construction.REA determined that the proposed project is an environmentally acceptablealternative that meets DPC's need with a minimum of adverse environmentalimpact. REA has concluded that project approval would not constitute amajor Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.Therefore, the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is notnecessary. In accordance with REA's Environmental Policies and Procedures, 7 CFR Part1794, DPC advertised in the area newspapers requesting comments on theenvironmental aspects of the proposed project. DPC also held three meetingsin the project areas to solicit public input. All comments were resolvedand incorporated in its BER. This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance underNo. 10.850_Rural Electrification Loans and Loan Guarantees. For the reasonsset forth in the final rule related notice to 7 CFR Part 3015, SubpartV in 50 FR 47034, November 14, 1985, this program is excluded from thescope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultationwith State and local officials.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: June 29, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John H.
