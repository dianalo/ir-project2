These people are cold andhungry and mad. How could this have happened?'' activist JohnSteinbruck said.   Activists blamed the National Union of the Homeless, whichorganized the gathering, for failing to provide adequate facilities.   Steinbruck said he took a truckload of blankets to the parkinglot at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium Thursday night. ``They have noplace to sleep. My truck was mobbed,'' he said.   Victoria Luna, a spokeswoman for the National Union of theHomeless, said: ``I think we're all doing the best job we can.There were problems, I admit. Yesterday there was no water and noblankets, and it was very cold.''   Recent nighttime low temperatures in the nation's capital havebeen about 50 degrees.   A heated tent and eight outhouses are on the site, Luna said.People who visited the site said 200 to 400 people were there.   ``That's not to say that conditions there are adequate, but thatpoints out exactly what we are here protesting,'' she said. ``A lotof us wish we were able to make people more comfortable.''   ``They are very, very disorganized,'' said Community forCreative Non-Violence spokeswoman Carol Fennely. Fennely said hergroup, which runs the city's largest private homeless shelter, hasgiven the Union group about $4,000 to help pay for the convention.   ``We haven't seen what they did with the money,'' she said.   The homeless are gathered for what the group calls the nation'sfirst homeless convention.   Luna said the group was preparing for an early morning march tothe Department of Housing and Urban Development on Friday.   The homeless marchers went to the stadium parking lot after theywere turned away from a lot across the river in Virginia owned bythe Navy.</TEXT></DOC>
