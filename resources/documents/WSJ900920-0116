Take the case of William Thigpen, a 37-year-old homelessman who was arrested last December. The charge? Sellingyo-yos on a midtown Manhattan sidewalk without a license.</LP><TEXT>   The Manhattan district attorney's office geared up toprosecute the case, but its efforts were thwarted initiallyby criminal-court Judge John E.H. Stackhouse. Noting that thearrest occurred close to Christmas and Hanukkah, JudgeStackhouse charitably dismissed the case.   But that wasn't the end of it for the prosecutor's office,which promptly appealed, arguing that &quot;the spirit of theholidays&quot; was hardly a sufficient ground to let Mr. Thigpenoff the hook. The court's appellate division agreed andordered Judge Stackhouse to rehear the case.   Earlier this week, the judge ruled once more in thelong-running saga. Again he dismissed the case, and this timehe was really wound up. In his opinion, Judge Stackhouse saidthe police could perhaps find &quot;a more socially usefulpurpose&quot; than busting yo-yo dealers.   The judge said he doubted whether a conviction would deterother unlicensed yo-yo vendors if they somehow learned aboutthe case. And he said it was unlikely that dismissing thecase of one unlicensed yo-yo vendor would affect the welfareof the general public.   In fact, the judge suggested, with violent crime rampant,&quot;the public's confidence is more likely to be diminished bythe amount of time and expense already expended on Mr.Thigpen's prosecution.&quot;   A spokeswoman for the district attorney's office says theoffice still disagrees with Judge Stackhouse's decision --although it plans no further appeal. &quot;This is aquality-of-life crime,&quot; she says.   Granted, New York's quality of life has taken some knocksin recent weeks. Time magazine trumpeted the decline of NewYork on a recent cover. And the magazine commissioned a pollthat showed the majority of New Yorkers would prefer to livesomewhere else.   So where does New York Mayor David Dinkins stand on theissue of yo-yo offenders? He's backing the prosecutors.   A spokesman for the mayor says the case goes beyondyo-yos. After all, he says, if people are left free to sellwhatever they want on street corners, why would retailerswant to rent space in the city?</TEXT></DOC>
