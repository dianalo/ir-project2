The announcement is a clear sign that the gold miningindustry is struggling, as prices have dropped below $350 anounce this quarter.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, Battle Mountain said it plans to take a $4million, or five-cent-a-share, write-down on its San Juangold mine property in California. The company signed anagreement giving Centurion Gold Ltd. an option to buy theproperty at a price that would result in a loss on theinvestment.   In the first half of 1991, the mining company reported netincome of $6.8 million, or nine cents a share, on sales of$76.8 million.   The company expects to generate strong cash flow and willhave enough funds to carry out all the mining projects it nowhas under way, a spokesman said. But weak gold prices,increased mining and milling costs, depreciation charges fromacquisitions and new-mine start-up costs are expected togenerate losses equal to first-half profits, the companysaid.   Battle Mountain said it expects to sell 420,000 ounces ofgold in 1991, compared with 345,000 ounces in 1990. Cashproduction costs are expected to be about $197 an ounce,compared with $155 an ounce last year, and total operatingcosts will reach about $281 an ounce, compared with $205 anounce in 1990.   The company said it is preparing a 1992 operating planthat will take into consideration the weak gold market. Theplan may include cost-cutting measures as well as somerevenue-boosting efforts, the spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
