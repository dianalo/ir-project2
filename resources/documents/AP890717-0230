(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dow Chemical Co. will acquire 67 percentof the stock in Marion Laboratories Inc. under a tentativetransaction announced Monday.   The total cost of the deal for Dow is difficult to estimate. Theclosing price of Marion's stock Monday indicates that the marketvalues Marion's 155 million shares at $5.2 billion.   The deal, if completed, will create a new publicly traded companyconsisting of Marion Laboratories and Cincinnati-based Merrell DowPharmaceuticals, which is now a Dow Chemical subsidiary.   The new company, although majority-owned by Dow Chemical, wouldbe based in Marion's hometown of Kansas City and would be calledMarion Merrell Dow Inc.   ``It's just a wonderful opportunity,'' said Larry Wheeler,Marion's vice president of communications. ``This gives us a chanceto remain a publicly traded company and yet gain access to one ofthe strongest research institutes in our industry.''   In the first part of the transaction, Dow would buy 39 percent ofMarion's 155 million shares of common stock at $38 a share, or $2.3billion. Later it would issue new shares of Marion to Dow, givingDow 67 percent of Marion's then outstanding shares.   Dow would pay for the newly issued shares by turning Merrell Dowover to Marion and issuing a new class of Dow securities thatprovide for payments by Dow to Marion shareholders based on Marion'sstock price at the time.   Marion's stock jumped $8.25 a share to $33.50 in consolidated NewYork Stock Exchange trading. But it remained below the $38 a shareoffered by Dow for 39 percent of the stock, indicating thatinvestors are skeptical about the per-share value of the second halfof the deal.   Dow's stock fell $1.50 a share to $88.37{ on the Big Board.   Wheeler said Marion had been looking at a number of differentopportunities in the last few months and chose Dow Merrell becauseits products would not overlap with Marion products. Dow hasconcentrated on respiratory and central-nervous system products,while Marion focused on cardiovascular and urology.   Ewing Kauffman, who founded Marion in 1950, and his familysupport the transaction and will tender their shares to Dow, Newcomsaid.   The Kauffmans now control 23 percent of Marion stock. Kauffman isco-owner of the Kansas City Royals.   Wheeler said managers of Marion Merrell Dow would be drawn fromthe management of both companies. No layoffs are anticipated, hesaid.   Jon Braatz, an analyst with B.C. Christopher Securities Co. inKansas City, said, ``It's a good thing for Marion and all partiesconcerned. There are a lot of happy faces today.''   Marion, with 3,500 employees, had earnings of $150 million lastyear on sales of $752 million.   Its sales exploded in the early 1980s thanks to the drugCardizem, which brought in $441 million of the company's revenueslast year.   Marion has been selling Cardizem tablets for angina patientssince 1982, and this year received FDA approval and began sellingthe sustained-released form of the drug to treat high-blood pressure.   But its stock has never fully recovered the value lost in thestock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987. Since then, the stock hasdipped at times below $20 a share, when it had previously beentrading in the $30 and over range.   Scott Stevenson, another B.C. Christopher analyst, said someinvestors had been concerned that Marion did not have any othersignificant products under development in preparation for losingexlusive rights to Cardizem SR in 1992. It recently bought a 20percent share in US Bioscience of Philadelphia, which has eightcancer treatment drugs under development.   Dow Chemical is based in the Detroit suburb of Midland. MerrellDow is based in Cincinnati, Ohio.</TEXT></DOC>
