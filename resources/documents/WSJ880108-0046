Gigot </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ECO </IN><G> CNG </G><TEXT>   So here we have from Rep. David Obey, unwittingly, a perfect commentary on the 100th Congress. Asked this week how Democratic Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii could have sneaked $8 million, to build a school in France for Jewish refugees, into the fiscal 1988 budget, Mr. Obey (D., Wis.) wondered why anyone would care all that much about &quot;a lousy $8 million.&quot; Mr. Obey says he was quoted out of context, but why that should bother him is a mystery. As the latest budget disgrace demonstrates, his colleagues don't believe $8 million, or even $1 trillion, is all that big a deal.    Ah, the budget. Another year, another fiasco: Washington yawns. Congress did its usual late-December all-nighter, everyone declared victory and went home for Christmas, and almost no one noticed what really happened.    Slowly, however, we are beginning to learn what is really buried in the budget's 2,000 pages. Rupert Murdoch discovers Sen. Edward Kennedy has fixed it so he has to sell his newspapers in Boston and New York. Toshiba learns it can no longer sell anything to the Pentagon. Sen. Inouye's devotion to Jews from North Africa (and, perhaps, Jewish campaign contributors) is revealed. How can this be? Wasn't this a &quot;deficit-reduction act&quot;? Didn't our legislators know what was in the budget they voted for?    Of course they didn't. To reconcile the bills, conferees met in small corners of the Capitol; most meetings were closed to everyone but conferees and staff. Even the conferees -- the most senior members of Congress -- didn't know what was going on elsewhere. &quot;The only thing that I really saw was the defense bill,&quot; says Rep. Bill Young (R., Fla.), a defense conferee.    In isolated conferences, members had only their consciences to guide them -- with predictable results. Sen. Kennedy (D., Mass.) sauntered over to the education subconference to make a pitch for his pet New England &quot;Star Schools&quot; program. He came away with $19.1 million. Sen. Lowell Weicker (R., Conn.) pushed through some $80 million for his favorite special interest, the National Institutes of Health. In such ways are &quot;lousy millions&quot; dispensed to thousands of special interests.    The logrolling became high art in Rep. Jamie Whitten's subconference on agriculture. Mr. Whitten (D., Miss.) grabbed a little more discretionary power from the administration on the Commodity Credit Corp., the better to have expanded influence over farm subsidies. Sen. Quentin Burdick, (D., N.C.), had a $10 million subsidy program created for sunflowers. And Rep. Virginia Smith (R., Neb.) got language commissioning a study to see if residents of a Nebraska county should receive $20 million in disaster relief.    &quot;In my experience, when the egregious things are happening, no one speaks up,&quot; explains a staffer. &quot;It's one big happy family.&quot; At one point, an exasperated Sen. Thad Cochran (R., Miss.) said he'd compromise this way: The senators would accept only half of the &quot;agriculture research&quot; projects they wanted, but Mr. Whitten could keep all of his. Mr. Whitten said he thought that was reasonable.    In the wee hours of Dec. 22, all the conference results were stacked into a pile on the floor. &quot;Members were told, you can look at it if you want, but don't mess it up,&quot; says one staffer. The House, for its part, had all of an hour to debate before voting. Most members had to rely on little more than blind faith. Two weeks later, congressional staffers say they're still trying to find out what's all in the bill.    The frenzy also made it close to impossible for the administration to have much influence. The White House had put together an &quot;A&quot; list of 36 items that had to be changed or the president would veto. The White House won most of those changes -- on Contra aid and the Fairness Doctrine, for example -- but it was essentially powerless to stop most of the rest.    On the Murdoch provision, for example, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said this week that &quot;I don't think any of us were aware of this amendment until it slipped out from under wherever it was hiding.&quot; And on Medicaid, the administration used a veto threat to deny Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.) the $6 billion in new spending that he wanted, but it still had to swallow $1 billion.    &quot;We didn't get a copy of the continuing resolution until 1 or 2 a.m.,&quot; explains budget director Jim Miller, &quot;and the reconciliation bill came even later.&quot; Mr. Miller says he then ordered his 225 budget examiners to scour all 2,000 pages for &quot;anything in there that's a real zinger,&quot; but the smaller outrages had to be let go. Mr. Miller had about 12 hours to determine whether he should recommend the president sign the budget that afternoon -- or let the entire government shut down.    By now, nearly every member will admit privately that the budget process is a joke. &quot;Even people in public life have some sense of embarrassment about the hypocrisy,&quot; says Sen. Bill Armstrong (R. Colo.), one of the most thoughtful supporters of budget reform. Sen. Armstrong is one of the few who recognize that reform demands that Congress cede to the executive some of the power it has wrested away since the mid-1970s. He has recommended a line-item veto or presidential authority to rescind items (thus forcing Congress to override a veto if it wants to pass any single item).    Not that the Congress has the stomach for such a vote anytime soon. The Democratic leadership might change its view if it ever wins the White House, but for now the last-minute, all-or-nothing frenzy gives it a useful tool to beat up a Republican president. &quot;I sometimes think they hold these things up to the last minute so they can do just what they want to do,&quot; says Mr. Young, a Republican with nine terms' experience. Or, as Mr. Obey might put it, to keep spending those lousy millions. </TEXT></DOC>
