But official proposals to spend billions of federal dollars to revitalize the industry could well be too little -- and even too late.    Last year, the U.S. chip industry lost more than $1 billion as the demand for semiconductors remained flat and competition from price-slashing Japanese suppliers intensified. The mounting losses have aroused fears in Washington that the U.S. is losing a mainstay of its economic and military security.    Semiconductors -- small slices, or chips, of photographically etched silicon that channel electricity along microscopic pathways -- are used in a multitude of products ranging from computers and high-technology weapons systems to cars and appliances. &quot;Semiconductors truly are 'the industrial rice' of the information age,&quot; says a report released last week by a panel of the Defense Science Board, a high-level advisory committee to the Secretary of Defense. &quot;It would appear critically important for the U.S. to regain and maintain a strong competitive position in this field.&quot;    To stave off decline, the panel, working closely with the industry's main trade group, is recommending that the government provide $1 billion and special antitrust exemptions to launch a consortium of computer companies, chip makers and makers of semiconductor-manufacturing equipment, plus roughly another $1 billion for laboratory semiconductor research. These sums would be allocated over five years.    The cooperative venture, dubbed Sematech by the Semiconductor Industry Association, would produce future generations of memory chips -- the highest-volume chip products and a market that Japanese suppliers now dominate. The goal of Sematech wouldn't be to produce chips per se but to develop state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques to help U.S. companies get back into mass memory-chip production.    U.S. manufacturers' world market share in such chips has fallen to less than 10% from 100%, leading most of the few profitable American chip makers to pay more attention to the many specialized &quot;niche&quot; markets, which don't produce the great wealth and economic power that the high-volume, or &quot;commodity,&quot; markets can.    Many industry experts assert, however, that a consortium by itself wouldn't be enough, that it should be just one component of a more far-ranging industrial policy. They say the U.S. government must counter certain Japanese advantages -- such as lower-cost capital, low-cost manufacturing ability, less impatient shareholders and closer ties to customers -- with a set of supportive policies of its own. Even the Pentagon panel's report cites such structural elements as &quot;the major reason for the relative inadequacy&quot; of the U.S. chip industry compared to Japan's.    Some chip experts suggest that the U.S. should protect certain domestic chip markets to allay fears of skittish American investors. Others recommend providing subsidies to buffer U.S. chip makers from price wars that regularly erupt in commodity chip markets.    The protectionist part of industrial policy is still anathema to the Reagan administration, and to many politicians and economists who remember how a round of punitive tariffs worsened the Depression by cutting trade. Besides, say critics of the industrial-policy idea, Congress is likely to have little enthusiasm for the magnitude of the subsidies being sought for the industry.    Of broader concern, some economists worry that if the U.S. and other countries follow Japan's lead and try to dominate the same strategic industries, that will only result in more gluts and more depressed markets. Already the global economy has a glut of steel, ships and certain commodities because of government supports. Hence, industrial policy could become part of the trade problem rather than the solution.    But competitiveness is the latest buzzword in Congress, and there is a gathering tide of support there for some form of government trade intervention, including tariffs and subsidies.    &quot;There's a fair consensus emerging that we need greater partnership in promoting U.S. technology,&quot; says Rep. Don Ritter, Republican of Pennsylvania, the chairman of a task force of Republican congressmen focusing on the competitiveness of U.S. high-tech industries. &quot;The big question is: Can we learn enough from what the Japanese are doing to apply it in an American way that's also successful?&quot;    Moreover, support for shoring up semiconductor makers could rise sharply if the industry continues to deteriorate or if the existing semiconductor trade agreement between the U.S. and Japan is abrogated. The accord, struck last July, is designed to prevent Japanese chip makers from dumping their products here -- that is, selling them at below-cost prices -- and to encourage Japanese companies to buy more U.S. chips. But so far it has been ineffective, and U.S. trade negotiators allege cheating, which the Japanese deny. The U.S. has given Japan until April 1 to make the agreement work better.    Industry leaders here assert that Congress has a choice between helping the industry and seeing it largely disappear. &quot;We're past the point where the industry can take care of itself,&quot; declares Andrew S. Grove, the president and chief executive of Intel Corp., a Silicon Valley chip maker that last year lost $183.3 million. &quot;This isn't the 11th hour. It's 12:01.&quot;    Japan's edge does appear overwhelming. In the beginning, its chip industry was nurtured by industrial policy, Japan-style. In the mid-1970s, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, guided several of Japan's large electronics concerns into producing dynamic-random-access memory chips, or D-rams. The government supported the industry's early efforts with research grants, procurement contracts and a protected domestic market. By 1980, Japanese companies were supplying 42% of the world's D-rams.    By last year, their share had jumped to 79%. U.S. chip executives say the Japanese bought market share by dumping. Indeed, the Department of Commerce found last year that Japanese firms did dump memory chips. It was about to impose penalties, then suspended them last summer as part of the trade agreement.    But Japanese chip makers have also prospered as a result of the shift of electronics manufacturing from the U.S. to Asia, a trend beyond the control of either the U.S. or the Japanese industry. More important, the alleged dumping appears to be only a symptom of more fundamental Japanese pricing advantages that stem from many societal and institutional arrangements there.    The societal edge is well-known. For example, U.S. chip makers pay higher costs for capital because the Japanese government holds down interest rates and because such factors as limited social-security benefits induce Japanese workers to save at least four times as much of their income as Americans do, ensuring a vast pool of investable funds. Moreover, most young Japanese employees are better educated than their American counterparts. They also tend to be much more disciplined because of Japan's deep-rooted work ethic.    But the magnitude of the institutional advantages isn't well understood in this country. At the corporate level, Japanese electronics firms still cooperate with one another in government-sponsored research efforts, yet they also compete vigorously against one another in the marketplace, often in cutthroat fashion. The combination of cooperative research and stiff competition drives down Japanese manufacturing costs -- far and fast enough to soon turn a &quot;predatory&quot; price into a profit-making one, thus making the expansionist market-share strategy pay off.    Japanese chip makers are aided in this aggressive strategy by being part of huge, strong conglomerates that can afford to take early losses for the sake of long-term gains. The conglomerates themselves are assisted by close-knit groups of institutional shareholders who also understand and support the early-loss strategy.    Just how all these advantages add up can be seen in the plight of U.S. chip producers. In 1984, a period of peak demand, for example, U.S. chip makers operated their production equipment at about half the 52% efficiency rate of Japanese suppliers, according to VLSI Research Inc., a market-research firm specializing in the semiconductor-equipment industry.    Similarly, because American companies took about twice as long as Japanese firms to install and start using new equipment in 1984, they spent more than three times as much as Japanese companies to increase production by an equal amount. Consequently, the average cost of making one square inch of chips in Japan was $17.52 in 1984, compared with $26.71 in the U.S.    &quot;We don't even use the equipment we sell them as efficiently as they do,&quot; says G. Dan Hutcheson, VLSI's president.    The key to making chips in large quantities, say semiconductor engineers, is cramming as many copies of a circuit as possible onto a wafer of silicon without hurting yields -- the proportion of good chips to duds -- by overextending equipment. The Japanese make relatively large and few chips per wafer but with very high yields. In contrast, many U.S. chip makers, before bowing out of commodity production, tried to seed more and tinier memory chips on each wafer, a strategy that often backfired.    National Semiconductor Corp., for example, managed to shrink its design for 64-kilobit D-rams to such a small size in the early 1980s that it was poised to become one of the industry's lowest-cost manufacturers of the product. But the chip's features were too small and sensitive for mass production, recalls Ed Heitzeberg, a former National Semiconductor engineer and now vice president of Micron Technology Inc., based in Boise, Idaho.    Instead, the company chose in 1982 to build a larger, Japanese-designed D-ram, and within three years quit making Drams because &quot;it wasn't worth it,&quot; a spokesman says.    U.S. chip factories also have had problems with labor turnover. &quot;Japanese factories lose one or two people a year, whereas at one company I used to work for we'd lose an entire {graveyard} shift every six months,&quot; says Luke Smith, managing director of a National Semiconductor plant in Arlington, Texas. He adds, however, that in the throes of the chip-industry slump, workers are less likely to quit.    To be sure, it isn't all roses on the other side of the Pacific. Japanese chip makers have also suffered as prices for their biggest seller, the 256-kilobit D-ram, have fallen to under $2 from $9 in the past two years. All told, the Japanese chip industry lost as much as the U.S. industry last year, about $1 billion according to Dataquest Inc., a market-research firm based in San Diego, Calif.    The difference is that Japanese conglomerates can better afford to lose money on chips than most U.S. producers, most of whom have no other businesses and product lines to carry them through chip slumps or price wars.    The losses are especially hard on small companies like Micron that have to explain to Wall Street every quarter why they can't sell at a profit the only products they make. &quot;Maybe I don't mind paying 14% interest&quot; to borrow capital, says Micron's chairman, Joseph Parkinson, &quot;but the problem is you never know if they'll loan you any more.&quot;    Japanese chip companies don't have that problem. That is because Japan's large electronics conglomerates are affiliated with at least one of that country's six corporate clans, or &quot;zaibatsu,&quot; which revolve around the major Japanese banks.    Their banks will lend them as much money as they need at interest rates roughly half as high as those in the U.S. and will often grant special terms to chip units because of their strategic importance, according to Michael L. Gerlach, a business professor at the University of California at Berkeley who studies Japanese corporate structures. Japanese banks, he says, are also bound by &quot;moral obligation&quot; to help troubled affiliated companies, making for &quot;fundamentally different banking relationships&quot; in Japan than in the U.S.    For example, NEC Corp., the world's biggest producer of chips and a member of the Sumitomo zaibatsu, owes a third of its debt to Sumitomo-group financial institutions, according to Mr. Gerlach. Moreover, six of NEC's top 10 shareholders, who together hold a 25% stake in NEC, are other Sumitomo-clan companies. These zaibatsu relationships are one reason Japanese institutional investors turn over their shares less than one-tenth as often as do large American holders, creating &quot;a stable, strategic core&quot; -- still another factor that lets Japanese chip makers trade short-term profits for long-term goals, Mr. Gerlach says.    Overwhelmed by these various Japanese advantages in mass manufacturing, many U.S. chip makers have sought refuge in niche markets where they don't compete head-on with Japanese firms. A handful are managing to stay profitable. But the niche markets, say U.S. government officials and industry executives, don't provide the kind of wealth and industrial might that the commodity-chip markets promise.    Moreover, the report by the Defense Science Board panel worries that &quot;in the absence of a domestic mass-production revenue base . . . the specialty producers themselves may become dependent on foreign suppliers for their materials, equipment and fabrication technology, and would then be at a disadvantage when under competitive attack.&quot;    The panel's proposal for a consortium to mass-manufacture D-rams is designed to maintain a smaller, more consolidated group of companies in all phases of mass chip production, so that dependence doesn't become a problem and the companies can benefit from technological advances driven by mass D-ram production.    &quot;The whole point of this thing is to get the industry to adjust to a new reality,&quot; says a Pentagon official who is helping plan the consortium.    But there are numerous difficulties with the consortium concept, even as a first step toward industrial policy. The industry's own leaders doubt that some companies would cooperate. Industry experts had difficulty even agreeing on the wisdom of the board's final recommendation to take on the Japanese at mass D-ram manufacturing.    The government has discovered in other surveys, in fact, that most U.S. chip makers have found the manufacture of other high-volume chips just as useful as the manufacture of D-rams in honing their technology. Nonetheless, &quot;D-rams sort of got to be like God and motherhood after a while,&quot; says a source involved in the deliberations.    And many chip experts say it will take more than the roughly $2 billion the government panel has proposed to make U.S. producers competitive. If more U.S. companies do get back into D-rams, say critics of the consortium idea, Japanese companies will just bring their advantages to bear on other chip products and markets, making a more wide-ranging industrial policy necessary.    &quot;What do you do when the Japanese dump in the next generation&quot; of chip devices? asks Michael Borrus, deputy director of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy, at the University of California. &quot;In the long run, the government may need to subsidize price competition. If you make dumping a zero-sum game for the Japanese, they'll know when they can't win.&quot;    Adds Jeffrey Frey, co-author of the report by the Defense Science Board panel and a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Maryland: &quot;The consortium proposal isn't a long-term solution. It doesn't address the fundamental structural issues at the heart of the industry's problems.&quot;    ---  World Market Shares in Semiconductors                     1980       1985 United States        52%        50% Japan                33%        43% Others               15%         7%</TEXT></DOC>
