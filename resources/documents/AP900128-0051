(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The number of Americans planning to makemajor purchases or spend money on recreation has declined from lastyear, according to a poll released Sunday by the GallupOrganization.   Asked what they planned to do differently with their money in1990 compared to last year, 6 percent of 1,000 heads of householdsaid they would shell out for big-ticket items or leisureactivities.   Asked the same question last year, 12 percent said they wouldspend money in those areas.   The Princeton-based pollster conducted the poll in conjuctionwith Bank Advertising News of North Palm Beach, Fla., to determineAmericans' anticipated financial behavior in 1990. The randomlychosen respondents were interviewed by telephone last month.   As in the previous two annual polls, the survey found that about40 percent of Americans expected to have more money this year thanlast, 45 percent expected to have about the same amount and 16percent expected to have less.   The survey also found that 27 percent of the respondents saidthey would put more money into savings or certificates of deposit,roughly the same number as gave that answer last year.   Passbook savings accounts remain the most popular savingsvehicle, and were cited by 52 percent of those surveyed.   ``Despite the talk of a sluggish economy, the poll illustratessome confidence and even optimism at the grassroots level for theeconomy in the coming year,'' said Bank Advertising News EditiorFrank J. Diekmann.   ``There is also some evidence that more people are looking atincreasing their savings rather than purchasing goods,'' Diekmannsaid.   Gallup didn't give the poll's margin of error.</TEXT></DOC>
