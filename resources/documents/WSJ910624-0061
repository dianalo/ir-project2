It wouldn't have happened and therewould be no recession today if the financing of small andyoung companies had not collapsed after 1986, when tax reformmandated raising the top rate on capital gains to 33% from20%.   Despite President Bush's repeated calls for acapital-gains tax cut, most of official Washington doubtsthat the tax is a big deal for the economy. Venturecapitalists screamed when the rate was hiked and continuescreaming. Yet despite their skill at fostering newtechnology, they are seen as essentially a small economicforce, investing at most a few billion dollars a year. No oneis sure how much the country pumps annually into smallbusinesses and entrepreneurial activity. But absent hardnumbers, the total is assumed to be comparatively minor andthe capital-gains tax's impact on it uncertain.</LP><TEXT>   The numbers, however, are available. They tell a complexbut compelling story.   What might be called the small business andentrepreneurial finance market is really four markets. Thecapital-gains tax is not the sole influence on these markets,of course. Monetary policy, regulations, even internationalcapital flows have contributed to ups and downs over theyears. Here is an outline of the make-up of these markets andwhat influences them, the sources of the data, and theimplications for jobs.                                                                                                          Professional Venture Capital                                                                                                          This is the market everyone talks about -- investments innew and growing companies by professional venture capitalfirms.   Venture Economics Publishing Co. of Needham, Mass., keepstally of the venture capital industry's annual investmentsstretching from 1970 to the present. The industry itselfdates to the early '50s and as late as 1977 disbursed only afew hundred million dollars a year to portfolio companies.Investments mushroomed after the 1978 Steiger Amendmentlowered the effective capital gains tax to 28% from 35%, andeven more after the 1981 Tax Act dropped it to 20%. Passing$1 billion for the first time in 1980 (all figures are in1991 dollars), venture capital disbursements peaked at $4.8billion in 1987. By 1990, commitments had fallen to $2.1billion.                                                                                                          Initial Public Offerings                                                                                                          Going public is usually considered the last stage ofventure financing, although some professionals argue thatlater public offerings are often part of the entrepreneurialsupport process.   Prof. Jay Ritter of the University of Illinois hasassembled authoritative annual totals on Initial PublicOfferings for the years from 1960 to 1990.   The IPO market took off in the mid-1960s, reached $9.7billion in 1969 (as always, figures are in 1991 dollars), butthen collapsed to $2.8 billion in 1970, after Congressincreased the capital-gains tax rate. The market recoveredbriefly in 1971 and 1972 (when $8.9 billion was raised), as adebased dollar and price controls created a bubble in allequity markets, but collapsed again in 1973. By 1974, the IPOmarket had shrunk to a near-death $142 million, and itremained near death until the Steiger Amendment resurrectedit. Then, with setbacks in the 1982 recession and 1984, itzoomed upward to $24.1 billion in 1986, only to expire oncemore after the boosting of the capital gains tax. Last yearIPOs raised only $6 billion.   The financial press has heralded a recent flurry of IPOs.Mr. Ritter believes, however, that when real estate andclosedend mutual funds are screened out, this year's marketwill prove only a little larger than last's.                                                                                                          Angels                                                                                                          The term comes from Broadway's name for people who backshows. This market is made up of private individuals who backnew companies. Although nearly invisible, it provides mostoutside investment for start-ups, says University of NewHampshire professor William E. Wetzel, Jr., its leadingauthority. Angels tend to be upper-middle class (medianfamily income, $97,000), and many are successfulentrepreneurs. Seven out of 10 angels put their money intocompanies within 50 miles of their homes or offices.According to Professor Wetzel, virtually all firms receivingangel financing are incorporated, making it easier to cashout for a capital gain if all goes well.   In 1988 the Small Business Administration published astudy of the angel market titled &quot;The Informal Supply ofCapital.&quot; Findings were derived from three regional surveysconducted between late 1985 and mid-1987. The study estimatesthe average annual angel investment over these years at $40.9billion (as before, 1991 dollars) or about 10 times the sizeof the venture capital market.   The angel market appears to have contracted since 1986.Specialists in public financings for emerging biotechnologyfirms have noticed that the typical company they take publichas less angel capital than before, and many have none.   And a new kind of angel financing has appeared -- foreignmoney. People involved in all parts of entrepreneurialfinance report that Asians and Europeans have steppedforward, particularly for high-technology projects withinternational applications. Foreign investors are taxed athome, where capital gains taxes either don't exist or arelower than here.                                                                                                          Moms andamp; Pops                                                                                                          This market is where the middle class puts itsentrepreneurial capital, and like the middle class, it iswhere most of the money is. Amounts cited here are for yearlycapital expenditures of proprietorships and partnerships (notfor working capital raised or capital for financialinvestments), and yet in 1986 the total came to almost twicethat of the three other markets combined.   While Mesa Petroleum fits in this group, more typical aresmall service firms, law and accounting firms (those thataren't professional corporations) and most new businesses.   Since 1946, the Commerce Department has tracked annualcapital expenditures of non-farm, non-corporate businessesusing Census Bureau surveys. The Federal Reserve publishesthe series in its &quot;Balance Sheet for the U.S. Economy.&quot;   In the low capital gains tax era of the late 1940s to late1960s (effective rate through most of the period, 25%),non-corporate capital expenditures rose and fell with theeconomic tide, but generally climbed ($28.5 billion in 1991dollars in 1946 to $85.7 billion in 1969). After the 1969hike in the capital-gains tax, they had a setback (as didIPOs and, according to industry lore, venture capital, forwhich data were first collected a year later), though it wasminor.   In the several years that followed, inflation and pricecontrols overwhelmed the influence of the highercapital-gains tax. Proprietorships and partnerships includethe smallest and newest businesses, those hardest forregulators to find and throttle. Non-corporate capitalexpenditures topped $131 billion in 1973. Then came the firstoil shock: Between 1970 and 1975, these capital expendituresrose higher and fell farther than in any other period onrecord.   They started up again in the easy-money expansion of JimmyCarter's first two years in office (reaching $99.5 billion in1978) and dropped after Paul Volcker slammed on the breaks(falling to $77.8 billion in 1980).   In the early 1980s, non-corporate capital expendituresbegan to move in a new range, thanks to the lowering of thecapital gains tax in 1978 and 1981. As a result, although the1982 recession was the deepest in decades, they remainedhigher during it ($92.6 billion) than any time before theinflation force-fed '70s. They peaked in 1986 ($110.1billion). After the capital gains rate soared that year, theyfell to a new and lower range, and by 1990 were the lowestsince the early '60s ($62.3 billion).   Altogether, entrepreneurial investment was at an all-timepeak for a low-inflation period in 1986, when $179 billionwas raised in these four markets. By comparison, all SECprimary registrations that year (minus IPOs) came to just$287 billion. Of the entrepreneurial total, the middle classMom and Pop market accounted for 62%; angels, 23%; IPOs, 13%;and venture capital (deleting leveraged buyouts andacquisitions), 2%.   Four years later, the total capital raised in these fourmarkets had probably dropped to $91 billion, assuming angelsremained 23% of the total. If investment had continued at1986 levels through 1990, the economy's capital stock wouldnow be $247 billion greater.   The National Venture Capital Association estimates thatevery $50,520 its members invest (again, 1991 dollars)supports one job. The $247 billion of missing new capitaltherefore means 4.9 million fewer jobs.   Put another way, if the increase in the capital-gains taxin 1986 triggered $247 billion decline in entrepreneurialinvestment, keeping the tax where it was would have preservedthe 879,000 net jobs lost between May 1990 and April 1991,and added an additional 1.6 million more over the past fouryears. Unemployment today would be less than 5%, as opposedto 6.9%. There would be no recession.   So while most of Washington considers the capital-gainstax not worth talking about, President Bush turns out to havethe shrewdest head in town. The capitalgains tax cut is aboutjobs and, with two-third of entrepreneurial investmentcapital coming from the Mom and Pop market, about theaspirations of the middle classnot bad causes for apresident, or any politician, to champion.   ---   Mr. Judge, formerly a special assistant to PresidentReagan for speechwriting, is a communications consultant inWashington, D.C.</TEXT></DOC>
