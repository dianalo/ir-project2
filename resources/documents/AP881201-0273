The report followed an offer by Mexico's Energy Department tonegotiate a reduction in Mexico's oil exports in a bid to put someteeth into the OPEC cartel agreement to restrict production.   Energy Secretary Fernando Hiriart this week repeated an offer,previously spurned by the 13-member cartel, to reduce Mexico's 1.35million-barrel daily export platform, provided OPEC members enactsimilar reductions.   Reductions also would be sought from other independent producers,Hiriart said.   He said department officials planned informal talks with OPEC andindependent producers on possible quota reductions.   The Energy Department announced that an OPEC committee plans tovisit Mexico and other independent producers to negotiate reductionsto buttress Monday's OPEC pact, the Mexico City newspaper La Jornadareported Thursday.   Department officials could not be reached for comment Thursday, anational holiday called to mark the inauguration of President CarlosSalinas de Gortari.   The agreement by the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries calls for a cartel export ceiling of 18.5 million barrelsdaily, roughly 4 million barrels below current production.   A statement issued this week by former President Miguel de laMadrid praised the agreement and urged immediate consultationsbetween cartel and independent producers. But he warned muchremained to be done to shore up the weak global market.   ``Mexico urges all producers _ whether or not they are members ofOPEC _ to act with caution in the next few months,'' the statementsaid.   Mexico, the world's sixth-largest oil producer, has closelyfollowed the cartel's pricing and production guidelines.   Only two weeks ago, Hiriart announced Mexico was abandoning thatpolicy, because overproduction by OPEC members had rendered itsmarket quotas useless.   Mexico severely criticized OPEC this year for engaging in a pricewar it said threatened Mexico's share of the U.S. market and draggeddown average prices of Mexican export crude to under $10.   Mexico loses an estimated $500 million in foreign earnings foreach $1 drop in crude prices. Energy Department officialsacknowledge the country has lost $2 billion in anticipated revenuethis year.</TEXT></DOC>
