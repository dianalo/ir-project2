Worker participation would be expanded toincrease productivity and corporations would be granted traderelief, but only if they produced plans to revitalize theirproduction. The commission has also suggested consideration of a 5percent value-added tax to reduce imports, stimulate exports andcut the deficit.   Other initiatives that Cuomo alone can take credit for include:   _At his insistence, New York became the first state in thenation to create a Task Force on Life and the Law. The group oftheologians, lawyers, physicians, scientists and civil rightsactivists has come up with a legally acceptable definition of death_ the absence of brain activity _ and legislation that permitspeople to refuse intrusive medical efforts that might prolong theirlives. The task force is also studying surrogate parent contractsand policies for organ transplants.   _Cuomo has begun a program using schools as community centersthat provide care for students after regular school hours and he'sproposed Liberty Scholarships, a plan that would guarantee poorseventh graders a public college education if they stay in schooland get accepted into a college.   _He has secured passage of major bond issues for environmentalwork and for rebuilding the state's decaying roads and bridges.   _Cuomo persuaded the Legislature to establish a state-subsidizedprescription drug program for the elderly, to adopt a fiscalstrategy that will gradually reduce the state's recurringshort-term debt, and to approve legislation that would allowvictims of long-ago exposure to toxic substances to sue for damages.   _Cuomo has used his executive powers to create an inspectorgeneral's office to ferret out corruption in state agencies; toadopt regulations that insure against race, sex orsexual-preference discrimination by the state, and to improveproductivity in state government.   _In the wake of corruption scandals in New York City andallegations of wrongdoing by state legislators, he also battledbitterly with the leaders of the Legislature last year to win newlaws to police the conduct of elected and appointed officials.   A Newsweek poll of the nation's governors, conducted two yearsago, rated Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis, as the ``most effective''governor. Cuomo was eighth.   ``It's a question of communication,'' Cuomo says. ``If I hadsaid for five years what George Bush is now saying. If I had saidfor five years, `I want to be known as the education governor' andjust done all the things we've done for five years, I would now benationally regarded as an education governor. I didn't do that. Theprograms and substance are there, but I never identified it as thething we wished to be known for.''   Fellow Democrat Miller, who has not always been on goodrelations with Cuomo, suggests another theory. New York State'seconomy has been healthy and ``the money has flowed in,'' he says.``Your ultimate test is always in emergencies; you can be great ifthere are no emergencies.''   He doesn't think Cuomo's has been ``a peculiarly innovativeadministration.'' But he says Cuomo has borrowed ideas freely fromthe Legislature and other states and ``somebody who takes the bestof what's around is smart.''   Ultimately, Miller says, the governor ``is result-minded andcompromise-minded'' _ a real strength but also a weakness ``becausesometimes you let a lot of stuff go.''   But getting things done is what counts, Cuomo argues: ``Thegovernor is the quarterback. He has to get you across the goalline.''   Miller says the governor has yet ``to get ahead of the game'' indealing with the mentally ill, the retarded, the homeless, housing.And, Democrat Miller and Republican Anderson say, he hasn'tconsistently appointed top-flight officials. Both praise hisability as a communicator.   As for the 55-year-old governor, he says he loves his job and ismaking plans to run for a third four-year term in 1990. He iscareful nonetheless not to commit himself to seek re-election, orto close the door completely on a presidential bid in 1992 shouldthe Democrats lose this year.   ``Only God knows what's going to happen,'' he says.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 22</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
