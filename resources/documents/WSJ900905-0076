About 6,000 members of the Amalgamated Council ofGreyhound Local Unions, an ATU bargaining unit, have been onstrike against the GLI Holding Co. unit since March 2.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. La Sala said the Greyhound strike benefits, totalingabout $300,000 a week, had depleted the union's strike fundto about $2 million. Further payments would make it difficultfor the union to pay legal fees in connection with recentefforts to negotiate a bid to buy the bus company, he said.   Mr. La Sala said the termination of benefits wasn't a signthat the union is abandoning the strike. &quot;We intend tocontinue this fight for as long as it may take until it iswon or the company is destroyed,&quot; he said in the letter.   Battered by strike-related violence, Greyhound Lines filedfor protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federalBankruptcy Code in June. The union is currently innegotiations with Blackstone Group, a New York investmentbanking firm, on a possible employee-led bid for the company.</TEXT></DOC>
