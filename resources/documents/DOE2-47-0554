Fieldtrial experimental plots were set up at the Welch Whittle site in 1972in order to determine the most successful lime, fertilizer and vegetationtreatments prior to full scale grading and planting. The experimentalplots were sampled to determine the effects of some of the coal shalereclamation treatments on the microarthropod populations. Preliminarysampling of the experimental plots showed their faunas to be characteristicof the 'colonization stage' of reclamation with microarthropods, especiallyCollembola and Acari, dominant. These studies also indicated that additionof maintenance limestone and restriction of vegetation cutting were themost favourable treatments for the persistence of a diverse microarthropodfauna. This paper describes the ecology of the Collembolan fauna sampledat Welch Whittle monthly from May 1975 until May 1976 (and then intermittentlyto January 1977). The results are compared with those of Collembolanpopulations recorded from other studies of reclaimed land and of grasslandsites. 30 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
