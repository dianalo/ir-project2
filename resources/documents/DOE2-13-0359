This potential is applied to toponiumand we also use it to calculate the mass spectra of baryons, made upof three identical quarks. The three-body Schroedinger equation is solvedthrough a variational technique where the trial wavefunction is expandedin terms of a harmonic oscillator basis. Comparisons with experimentaldata and other calculations are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
