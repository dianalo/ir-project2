Employment and Training Commissioner James F. French ruled thestrike has had a substantial impact on the company's operations,overturning a decision he made Sept. 13 to grant jobless benefitsto the strikers.   The latest decision, French said, was not a reversal, but wasbased on the cumulative impact on the company of the strike thatbegan Aug. 6.   Ed Fitzpatrick, a business agent with Local 2222 of theInternational Brotherhood of Machinists, said the union wouldappeal French's ruling to the courts on the grounds he did not giveworkers a hearing.   Telephone company spokesman Peter Cronin praised the decisionand said he hoped it would inspire the strikers to return to thebargaining table.   ``The decision Sept. 13 to grant benefits was based on the factthe evidence did not show NET experienced a substantial curtailmentof its business activities,'' French said. ``Now, nine weeks intothe strike, they have provided information that does show asubstantial curtailment in many areas of their company.''   French said the information provided him by the company wasconfidential, but he said it showed service curtailment in areassuch as installations, repairs, cabling, maintenance, constructionand network services.   French said workers had collected about seven weeks of benefitsand would not have to repay that.   French said it was rare for his department to grant unemploymentbenefits to strikers. He said his initial ruling came because thetelephone company is so heavily automated at first it was notseriously affected by the walkout of operators, service techniciansand other employees.   But French said as the strike wore on, the effects mounted.   He said Massachusetts law, which requires companies to prove asubstantial curtailment of activities before strikers can be deniedjobless benefits, is unusual. Most states, he said, either prohibitgiving strikers unemployment benefits or allow it under mostcircumstances.   The major issue in the strike is a company demand that workersstart paying a portion of their health insurance premiums.</TEXT></DOC>
