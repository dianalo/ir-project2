Recently, it was found that it is safe to sinkshafts without foundation. In Pan Xie coal mine, it was found that sinkinga shaft without curbs resulted in rapid excavation and low cost. Sincethe base rock section was excavated by drill and blast method, the unevensurface of the shaft wall formed a lot of small natural curbs which couldstand the weight of shaft lining for many sections. Using rooted shaftlining to replace the curbs was suggested.
