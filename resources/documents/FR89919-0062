The Federal Advisory CommitteeAct (FACA), as amended by the Government in the Sunshine Act (Pub. L. 94-409),permits such closed advisory committee meetings in certain circumstances.Those portions of a meeting designated as closed, however, shall be closedfor the shortest possible time, consistent with the intent of the citedstatutes.The FACA, as amended, provides that a portion of a meeting may be closedwhere the matter for discussion involves a trade secret; commercial orfinancial information that is privileged or confidential; information ofa personal nature, disclosure of which would be a clearly unwarranted invasionof personal privacy; investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes;information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantlyfrustrate implementation of a proposed agency action; and information incertain other instances not generally relevant to FDA matters.Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarilymay be closed, where necessary and in accordance with FACA criteria, includethe review, discussion, and evaluatin of drafts of regulations or guidelinesor similar preexisting internal agency documents, but only if their prematuredisclosure is likely to significantly frustrate implementation of proposedagency action; review of trade secrets and confidential commercial or financialinformation submitted to the agency; consideration of matters involvinginvestigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes; and review ofmatters, such as personnel records or individual patient records, wheredisclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personalprivacy.Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarilyshall not be closed include the review, discussion, and evaluation of generalpreclinical and clinical test protocols and procedures for a class of drugsor devices; consideration of labeling requirements for a class of marketeddrugs or devices; review of data and information on specific investigationalor marketed drugs and devices that have previously been made public; presentationof any other data or information that is not exempt from public disclosurepursuant to the FACA, as amended; and, notably deliberative sessions toformulate advice and recommendations to the agency on matters that do notindependently justify closing.This notice is issued under section 10(a)(1) and (2) of the Federal AdvisoryCommittee Act (Pub.
