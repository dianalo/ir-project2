Airport personnel were preparing to fill the plane's tanks withabout 6,600 gallons of fuel to maintain conditions inside theplane, where the hostages were being held for a 13th day.   The hijackers did not set a new deadline.   Kuwait Airways Flight 422, with 112 people on board, washijacked April 5 on a flight from Bangkok to Kuwait.   The plane spent three days in Mashhad, Iran, five in Larnaca,Cyprus, and arrived here early Wednesday.   The gunmen killed two passengers in Cyprus. They released 57hostages at Mashhad, 13 at Larnaca and one on Friday in Algiers.   The hijackers earlier asked for the fuel by 11 a.m. (6 a.m.EDT). In a brief statement in Arabic to the control tower, thehijackers said, ``At the request of our brothers the Algerians weannounce that we have agreed to extend the departure time warningto give an opportunity for the efforts by the Algerians.''   An Algerian negotiator boarded the blue and white Boeing 747 for15 minutes, leaving the aircraft at 11:10 a.m. (6:10 a.m. EDT).   Inside the airport terminal building, Algerian Interior MinisterHedi Khediri pursued negotiations with a high-level Kuwaitidelegation.   On Saturday, the hijackers said they would ask that the plane berefueled ``to settle our score with Kuwait somewhere else.''   ``We do not want the massacre to take place here in friendlyAlgeria, which welcomed us and which tried to settle the problem,''they said Saturday.   The hijackers are demanding freedom for 17 terrorists imprisonedin Kuwait for the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and French embassiesthere.   Shortly after the threat, Kuwaiti government asked Algerianauthorities to prevent the plane from leaving.   The new activity came as Moslems prepared to observe Ramadan,the month-long period of fasting when Islamic values areparticularly stressed. It starts here on Monday.   It was not immediately clear how the holiday might affectnegotiations or the fate of the hostages.   Three members of the Kuwaiti royal family are among the hostages.   There are believed to be about eight hijackers, one or two ofwhom may have boarded in Iran.   Algeria has a record of negotiating solutions to hostagesituations. It successfully gained the release in 1981 of Americansheld at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran for 444 days.</TEXT></DOC>
