Michael Dukakis hoped to shownationwide appeal and emerge as the front-runner in a bruisingDemocratic race.   Jesse Jackson, drawing upon his black political base in Dixie,looked to win several states and hundreds of Democratic delegates.Sen. Albert Gore Jr. tested his Southern strategy in a battle withRep. Richard Gephardt to emerge as the moderate contender in theindustrial states to come.   Pre-election surveys indicated Bush could hope for a sweep ofthe GOP contests, with Sen. Bob Dole contesting in just a handfulof states. Pat Robertson and Jack Kemp seemed out of the runningalmost everywhere.   The campaign was notable for its accusatory TV commercials. Thenumber of convention delegates at stake _ 712 in 17 Republicancontests and 1,307 in 21 Democratic primaries and caucuses _ madeSuper Tuesday the busiest day of this or any other presidentialnomination campaign.   As the day dawned, Bush and Dukakis were the leaders in the huntfor national convention delegates. Democratic delegates fromMinnesota's Feb 23 caucuses were being allocated with most toDukakis, followed by Jackson.   Beforehand, Dukakis had 70 delegates, Gephardt 50, Simon 36,Jackson 28 and Gore 22. It takes 2,082 delegates to win theDemocratic nomination.   Among the Republicans, it was Bush with 126, Dole with 65, Kempwith 35 and Robertson with 8. It takes 1,139 delegates to win theGOP nomination.   Democratic surveys suggested that Dukakis and Jackson would eachcarry at least a handful of states. Dukakis had his home state ofMassachusetts in his pocket, but Gore countered with his Tennesseeand Gephardt with Missouri.   Dukakis, having won several New England contests, hoped todemonstrate a broader appeal than any of his rivals with victoriesin Texas, Florida, Washington, Maryland, Rhode Island and Hawaii.Jackson was strong all across Dixie and Gore's hopes seemed to reston the strength of second-place finishes.   Dukakis targeted his campaign at ethnic voters, liberals andunion workers in pockets across the South, aiming his appeal aswell at the huge elderly population in Florida.   Dukakis hoped to use his superior finances and organization topick up dozens of delegates in states where he didn't expect to winoutright. His rivals made the same effort on a smaller scale,knowing they could earn at least one delegate in any congressionaldistrict where they received 15 percent of the vote.   Jackson, who has run well in some states without a large numberof black voters, was drawing on his core constituency for the firsttime this year and hoped to win in Georgia, Virginia, Mississippi,Louisiana and Alabama, as well as one or two other states.   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois bypassed the Super Tuesday electionsto concentrate on the primary next week in his home state. GaryHart, the long-ago front-runner, was the invisible man politically.   The Republican picture was entirely different. Bush, whosecampaign was in jeopardy before New Hampshire voted three weeksago, was comfortably ahead in pre-election polls in nearly everySuper Tuesday state. He aimed to pile up enough delegates to makehis nomination seem inevitable, while Dole hoped to snare enough tocarry him credibly to next week's primary fight in Illinois.   Robertson, the former television evangelist, bid for secondplace in a few states and a win in the Washington caucuses. Kemp,who had dreamed of emerging as a conservative alternative in therace, faced a 17-state shutout and seemed likely to withdraw laterin the week.   Gore was banking everything on a strong showing in his nativeregion. He began with his base in Tennessee and hoped to pick up afew hundred delegates even if he finished behind Jackson acrossDixie.   Gephardt, who won the kick-off Iowa caucuses exactly one monthago and followed it up in South Dakota, counted on a home state winin Missouri.</TEXT><TEXT>   _</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
