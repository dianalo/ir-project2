The moderation ratiocan vary from 1.45 to 1.15. The reactor is controlled and monitored bymeans of gadoliniated spectral shift rod clusters and by B4C controlrod clusters enriched with boron 10. A sufficient Gd/sub 2/O/sub 3/ content(6%) has been determined. The fissile material balance of the cycle iscompiled by identifying the gains of the spectral shift: 14% of cycletime. The presence of an absorber in the spectral shift clusters is necessaryto guarantee the subcriticality of the core in warm conditions (180/sup0/C).</TEXT></DOC>
