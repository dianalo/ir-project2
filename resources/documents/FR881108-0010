The MMSalso is deleting the references to payments for advanced exploration ordevelopment costs and prepaid reserve payments in the ``gross proceeds''definition.The MMS also is amending Notice to Lessees of Federal Onshore Oil and GasLeases Number 1 (NTL-1) and Notice to Lessees and Operators of Indian Oiland Gas Leases Number 1A (NTL-1A) to remove the requirement to pay royaltieson take-or-pay payments.

Background</ITAG>On January 15, 1988, MMS published notices in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 1184 and 53 FR 1230) of final rulemakinggoverning the valuation, for royalty purposes, of oil and gas producedfrom Federal onshore and Outer Continental Shelf leases and from IndianTribal and allotted leases. The rules amended previous valuation regulationsand became effective March 1, 1988.Under the definition of ``gross proceeds'' at 30 CFR 206.151, the new rulesspecifically included take-or-pay payments as part of ``the total moniesand other consideration accruing to an oil and gas lessee for the dispositionof unprocessed gas, residue gas, or gas plant products.'' Accordingly,lessees were required to pay royalties on take-or-pay payments when thosepayments were received.The Department of the Interior's (Department) position requiring royaltieson take-or-pay payments predated the new rulemaking and represented a long-standingpolicy. While the rulemaking process was ongoing, the take-or-pay positionwas being challenged in two U.S. District Courts and resulted in conflictingdecisions. In <T3>Mesa Petroleum Company v. U.S. Department of Interior, </T3>647 F.Supp. 1350 (W.D. La., November 10, 1986), the U.S. District Court for theWestern District of Louisiana determined that there is no statutory, regulatory,or contractual authority to collect royalties on take-or-pay payments.However, in <T3>Diamond Shamrock Exploration Co. v. Donald P. Hodel, et al. </T3>(E.D.La., Civil No. 86-0537, and consolidated cases, January 23, 1987), theU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana agreed with theDepartment that take-or-pay payments are part of the lessee's gross proceedsfor the disposition of production and thus are royalty-bearing at the timethe take-or-pay payments are received.The two District Court decisions were consolidated on appeal to the Courtof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Nos. 87-3207, 87-3195, and 87-4069, respectively).On August 17, 1988, the Court ruled that ``* * * royalty payments are notdue on take-or-pay payments and are only due on gas actually produced andtaken (i.e., so-called ``make-up'' gas).'' In reaching its decision, theCourt held that the Department's position of treating take-or-pay payments,when made, as part of the value on which royalty is due did not comportwith either the intent of the governing statutes or the language of therelevant leases and regulations, which require that royalties are due onlyon the value of ``production'' saved, removed, or sold from the leasedproperty. The Court adopted as the legal definition of the word ``production'',as used in the context of calculating royalty payments, the actual physicalseverance of minerals from the formation. Accordingly, the Court concludedthat ``royalty payments are due only on the value of minerals actuallyproduced, i.e., physically severed from the ground. No royalty is due ontake-or-pay payments unless and until gas (namely, make-up gas) is actuallyproduced and taken.''A. Take-or-Pay Requirement in Section 206.151The Fifth Circuit's ruling therefore requires that MMS amend its regulationsto remove the requirement to pay royalties on take-or-pay payments at thetime the payment is made. Of course, royalties still are due when make-upgas is taken.B. Advanced PaymentsThe definition of ``gross proceeds'' in andSection; 206.151 of the recentlyadopted gas valuation rules also requires the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">Payments or credits for advanced exploration or development costsor prepaid reserve payments that are subject to recoupment through creditsagainst the purchase price or through reduced prices in later sales andwhich are made before production commences become part of gross proceedsas of the time of first production.</ITAG>The advanced payment program was initiated in 1970 and was designed tofacilitate capital formation by producers to finance development and productionof new gas supplies in order to help alleviate the existing natural gasshortage. The advanced payment program was governed successively by a seriesof five ``advanced payment orders'' issued by the Federal Power Commission(FPC) until the program's termination at the end of 1975. FPC Orders Nos.410, 410-A, 441, 465, and 499 governed advances made pursuant to contractsentered into after October 1, 1970, through December 31, 1975.The program was conditionally supported in <T3>Public Service Commission, State of New York v. FPC, </T3>151 U.S.App. D.C. 307, 467 F.2d 361 (1972), as a ``justifiable experiment in thecontinuing search for solutions to our nation's critical shortage of naturalgas.''Under the requirements of the FPC advanced payment program, pipelines providedproduction capital in the form of pre-payments to producers (advanced payments)for future deliveries of natural gas. Producers were expected to seek advancedpayments because the advances would provide them with a source of interest-freecapital. It was anticipated that pipeline participation in the programwould be assured since pipeline rates could reflect a return on qualifyingadvanced payments. Furthermore, pipeline participation was encouraged bythe prospect of securing needed gas reserves for the future while transferringto the rate payer the added cost of making advanced payments for gas. The ``cost'' to the pipeline of an advanced payment was the cost of financingthe amount advanced, a factor principally determined by interest ratesin the bond market. Current purchasers from the pipeline would shoulder,in the rates they paid, the ``carrying charges'' on these interest-freeloans to producers. In effectuating an advanced payment, the producer and the pipeline wouldenter into a contract specifying the amount advanced, the potential productioncommitted, and the rate of reimbursement whether through delivery of productionor other arrangements such as periodic payments. When production was aboutto commence, the producer and the pipeline would enter into a typical gaspurchase contract which was separate from the advanced payment contract.In some cases the gas purchase contract would reflect terms governing thereimbursement associated with the advanced payment. Qualifying advance payments had to be made prior to deliveries under anassocited purchase contract. Substantial lag times were inevitable betweenthe date of the advance and its full repayment in gas, especially if theadvance were made to fund exploration or other pre-production producerexpenditures. Advances had to be fully recovered within a ``reasonableperiod of time following commencement of deliveries,'' and in any case``within a 5-year period * * *'' following initial delivery. Section 206.151 required that royalty be paid on the full amount of theadvanced payment at the time when production first begins, when the amountsadvanced become repayable in gas, because the payments become considerationfor gas at that point. This requirement was analogous to the requirementto pay royalty when a take-or-pay payment was made, not when the make-upgas was produced, because the take-or-pay payment was part of the totalconsideration for all gas purchased under the contract when received. Inview of the Fifth Circuit's ruling that royalty is not owed until make-upgas is actually produced and taken, it follows that no royalty is due onadvanced payments until the specific gas which repays the advanced paymentactually is produced. Therefore, MMS is removing the requirement from therules. A similar advanced payment provision is being removed from the oilvaluation rules, andSection; 206.101. C. Notice to Lessees_1 and 1A For onshore Federal and Indian leases, a prior rule required royaltiesto be paid on take-or-pay payments. In 1977, following proposals and anopportunity to comment, the Department adopted Notice to Lessees and Operatorsof Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Leases (NTL-1, 42 FR 4546, January 25, 1977)and Notice to Lessees and Operators of Indian Oil and Gas Leases (NTL-1A,42 FR 18135, April 5, 1977). Part III of both NTL-1 and NTL-1A provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">Payments made by a gas purchaser pursuant to a contractual ``take-or-pay''clause are subject to royalty under the terms of the lease agreement.</ITAG>Therefore, the Department by rule required royalty to be paid on take-or-paypayments for onshore Federal and Indian oil and gas leases as early as1977. The Fifth Circuit's ruling thus requires that these rules also beamended so as to be consistent with the underlying statutes and lease terms.NTL-1 and NTL-1A were terminated when the new product value rules becameeffective on March 1, 1988. Therefore, the rule change is being made forthe 1977-1988 period so that the legally proper standard can be appliedfor audits, etc. which relate to the time period when the rules were effective.The Department is continuing to review the Fifth Circuit's decision todetermine whether any other regulations or royalty valuation policies areaffected by the Court's ruling. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Final Rule Amendments </ITAG>To be consistent with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision regardingroyalties on take-or-pay payments, MMS is amending its gas valuation regulationsby revising the definition of ``gross proceeds'' in 30 CFR 206.151; thedefinition is amended by deleting the term ``Take-or-pay payments'' fromthe third sentence, and by deleting the following sentence from the definitionsof ``gross proceeds'' in both andSection;andSection; 206.101 and 206.151:<ITAG tagnum="21">Payments or credits for advanced exploration or development costsor prepaid reserve payments that are subject to recoupment through creditsagainst the purchase price or through reduced prices in later sales andwhich are made before production commences become part of the gross proceedsas of the time of first production.</ITAG>Today's changes to the regulations regarding take-or-pay payments and advancedpayments are consistent with, and are the minimum necessitated by, theFifth Circuit's recent decision. Until the Department completes its considerationas to whether or not additional alterations to regulations or royalty valuationpolicies are required or suggested by the Court's ruling, the product valueregulations will be premised on the concept that royalty value cannot beless than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee. The MMS, therefore,will carefully review all situations to ensure that lessees do not improperlyattempt to use contractual devices to avoid royalties by denominating astake-or-pay or advance payments other consideration which is part of thegross proceeds for production. The final oil and gas valuation regulations became effective March 1, 1988.Therefore, this final rule amendment is also effective March 1, 1988. The MMS also is amending andSection; 206.150 to reflect the amendment toNTL-1 and NTL-1A to remove the last paragraph of section III which requiresthe reporting and payment of royalties on take-or-pay payments. This modificationis effective as of the date of issuance of NTL-1 and NTL-1A, respectively,and effective until March 1, 1988, the date of termination of the notices.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Procedural Matters</ITAG>Administrative Procedure ActThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has determinedthat, based on the underlying statutes and leases, the Department cannotrequire lessees to pay royalties on take-or-pay payments unless and untilthere is make-up gas production. The rule changes provided herein are necessaryto make the Department's rules consistent with the court's decision. Accordingly,there is good cause to determine that notice and public comment are unnecessary.Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility ActThe Department of Interior has determined that this document is not a majorrule under E.O. 12291 and certifies that this document will not have asignificant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities underthe Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This final rulemaking amends existing regulations toreflect a court decision that royalties are not due only until mineralsactually are produced.Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980This rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>National Environmental Policy Act of 1969It is hereby determined that this rulemaking does not constitute a majorFederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environmentand a detailed statement pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 30 CFR Part 206</ITAG>Coal, Continental Shelf, Geothermal energy, Government contracts, Indianlands, Minerals royalties, Natural gas, Petroleum, Public lands-mineralresources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: October 12, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
