On May 28, 1987, the petitioner,the U.S. Rayon Producers Committee, requested in accordance with andSection;355.10of the Commerce Regulations an administrative review of the order. We publishedthe initiation on June 19, 1987 (52 FR 23330). The Department has now conductedthat administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the TariffAct of 1930 (``the Tariff Act'').<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Review</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of Customs nomenclature. We willbe providing both the appropriate <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>(``TSUSA'') itemnumbers and the appropriate Harmonized System (``HS'') item numbers withour product descriptions. As with the TSUSA, the HS item numbers are providedfor convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.We are requesting petitioners to include the appropriate HS item number(s)as well as the TSUSA item number(s) in all new petitions filed with theDepartment. A reference copy of the proposed Harmonized System scheduleis available for consultation at the Central Records Unit, Room B-099,U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW.,Washington, DC 20230. Additionally, all Customs offices have referencecopies and petitioners may contact the Import Specialist at their localCustoms office to consult the schedule.Imports covered by the review are shipments of Swedish regular viscoserayon staple fiber and high-wet modulus (``modal'') viscose rayon staplefiber. Such merchandise is currently classifiable under TSUSA item numbers309.4320 and 309.4325. These products are currently classifiable underHS item numbers 5504.10.00-2 and 5504.90.00-2.The review covers the period January 1, 1986 through December 31, 1986and three programs. The only known Swedish exporter of this merchandiseto the United States is Svenska Rayon, AB.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs</ITAG>(1) Loans/Grants for Plant CreationUnder three agreements, the Swedish government provided Svenska with interest-freeloans for the creation of a modal fiber plant. The agreements providedthat the Swedish government would forgive the loans in equal amounts overten years if Svenska maintained its modal fiber production capacity forten years. If Svenska eliminated this production capacity prior to theend of the ten-year period, the agreements also provided that the remainingamount of the outstanding principal would fall due immediately.The first agreement, Project 77, was concluded in 1975, and the Swedishgovernment disbursed the funds between 1975 and 1977. The second agreement,Project 81, was concluded in 1978 and the funds disbursed between 1978and 1981. In 1979, the Swedish government provided a final interest-freeloan to Svenska for pollution control improvements to the modal fiber plant.Forgiveness of these loans began when the equipment purchased went intooperation. Although Svenska had modified its modal fiber plant to produceregular fiber, it maintained the modal fiber production facilities throughthe latter part of 1985. Accordingly, the Swedish government forgave tenpercent of the total disbursements to Svenska under Project 77 in eachyear from 1978 through 1985. Similarly, the Swedish government forgaveten percent of the total disbursement under Project 81 in each year from1981 through 1985 and ten percent of the environmental loan in each yearfrom 1980 through 1985.In our previous reviews of this order, we treated each ten-percent forgivenessas a grant and considered the benefit stream from each grant to be theremaining life of the loan. We treated the unforgiven portions of theseloans as contingent liabilities because Svenska's yearly ten-percent forgivenesswas contingent upon its maintaining modal fiber production capacity. (<T3>See, </T3>the preliminary results of review on rayon staple fiber fromSweden (51 FR 29145, August 15, 1986).)   In late 1985, however, Svenska permanently discontinued all modal fiberproduction and closed the modal fiber plant designed and developed forproduction of such fiber. In 1986, the Swedish Government concluded negotiationswith Svenska which resulted in forgiveness of Svenska's remaining indebtednessfrom the plant creation and pollution control. The effective date for forgivenesswas May 28, 1986.   If we had known that the contingency for forgiveness originally imposedby the Swedish government would never actually be enforced (<T3>i.e., </T3>the Swedish government forgave Svenska's remaining loanbalances even though the company ceased to produce modal fiber), we wouldhave from the outset considered these ``loans'' as outright grants, andapplied a declining balance methodology to measure the benefit. That is,we would have allocated the benefits from each grant over the 10-year averageuseful life of assets in the rayon fiber industry, according to the ``AssetGuideline Classes'' of the Internal Revenue Service, and assessed countervailingduties accordingly. Since it is now apparent that these loans were in factgrants, we have retrospectively recalculated the benefit streams usingthe declining balance methodology. We used as discount rates the nationalaverage corporate bond rates in Sweden for the years in which each grantwas received (obtained from the <T3>Monthly Digest of Swedish Statistics, </T3>a Swedish government publication).We consider those rates to be the best information available because wehave no information on Svenska's weighted cost of capital for those years.Because our current and prior methodologies produced different benefitstreams, we have adjusted our calculations to account for benefits previouslycountervailed to ensure that those benefits will not be countervailed inthis or subsequent reviews.   We allocated the benefits attributable to the review period over the valueof Svenska's net sales during the review period. On this basis, we preliminarilydetermine the benefit from this program to be 10.58 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3>(2) Elderly Employment Compensation Program   The Swedish government provided a subsidy to certain companies within thetextile and clothing industries through a special employment contributionfor older workers. This program provided compensation to a company basedupon the number of hours worked by employees over 50 years of age. A companyparticipating in the program had to agree not to dismiss or release redundantemployees of any age for any reason other than normal attrition. Paymentswere calculated on the basis of 28 kronor per hour for employees over age50 who wer involved in production. The payments could not exceed 15 percentof the compnay's total labor costs.   Svenska received its last payment under this program in July 1982. In January1983, the Swedish government excluded the rayon fiber industry, includingSvenska, from this program. Using the declining balance methodology referredto above, we calculated Svenka's benefit by allocating the 1982 paymentover ten years, the average useful life of assets in the rayon fiber industry.We used Svenska's 1982 weighted cost of capital as the discount rate.  We allocated the benefit attributable to the review period over the valueof Svenska's net sales during the review period. On this basis, we preliminarilydetermine the benefit from this program to be 0.46 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3>(3) Grant for Manpower Reduction and Conditional Loan   The Swedish government concluded an agreement with Svenska in 1980 consistingof two parts: a grant for manpower reduction and a conditional loan tocover operating losses. The grant was intended to compensate the companyfor maintaining redundant employees longer than collective agreements andemployment protection laws required, and for retraining employees to workelsewhere within the KF Industri group (the group of firms, including Svenska,owned directly or indirectly by Kooperativa Forbundet). The grant was paidthrough the National Labor Market Board in two installments, one in December1980, and the other in July 1981. Svenska received no new manpower productiongrants during the period of review.   Using the declining balance methodology, we allocated each grant over tenyears, the average useful life of assets in the rayon fiber industry. Weused as a discount rate the national average corporate bond rate in Swedenfor 1980, the year in which the agreement was reached.   We allocated the benefit attributable to the review period over the valueof Svenska's net sales during the review period. On this basis, we preliminarilydetermine the benefit from this grant to be 0.59 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3>.    For the conditional loan part of the 1980 agreement, the terms (includingthe length) and conditions depended on the company's profit levels. Theconditional loan was disbursed in three installments between 1980 and 1982.Under the original agreement, the Swedish government would forgive portionsof the outstanding principal and interest of the loan if Svenska did notmake a sufficient profit (as determined by a confidential formula concludedbetween the Swedish government and Svenska). If Svenska attained the requisitelevel of profit, it would have to repay a certain portion of the loan,including interest. Svenska did not make a sufficient profit in any yearbetween 1983 and 1985, and the Swedish government forgave the yearly repaymentof the loan in 1983, 1984 and 1985. On May 28, 1986, in conjuntion withthe forgiveness of the loans/grants for plant creation, the Swedish governmentforgave the total outstanding balance of this loan.   Because Svenska never made any payments on this loan, which was forgivenin its entirely over four years, we have reconsidered our methodology andare treating each of the three loan installments as grants given in theyear of receipt. As with the loans/grants for plant creation program, wehave applied the declining balance methodology, allocating benefits fromeach grant over the 10-year average useful life of assets in the rayonfiber industry, and have adjusted our calculations to account for benefitspreviously countervailed.   We allocated the benefit attributable to the review period over the valueof Svenska's net sales during the review period. On this basis, we preliminarilydetermined the benefit from the conditional loan to be 3.30 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3>Preliminary Results of ReviewAs a result of our review, we preliminarily determine the net subsidy tobe 14.93 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for the period January 1, 1986 through December 31,1986.The Department intends to instruct the Customs Service to assess countervailingduties of 14.93 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments ofthis merchandise exported on or after January 1, 1986 and on or beforeDecember 31, 1986.Further, the Department intends to instruct the Customs Service to collecta cash deposit of estimated countervailing duties, as provided by section751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, of 14.93 percent of the f.o.b. invoice priceon all shipments of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,for consumption on or after the date of publication of the final resultsof this administrative review. This deposit requirement shall remain ineffect until publication of the final results of the next administrativereview.Interested parties may submit written comments on these preliminary resultswithin 30 days of the date of publication of this notice and may requestdisclosure and/or a hearing within 10 days of the date of publication.Any hearing, if requested, will be held 30 days after the date of publicationor the last workday preceding.
