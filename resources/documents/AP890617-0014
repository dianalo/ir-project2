The Food and Drug Administration says it will ask drug companiesto stop promoting these hormones and drugs for non-nursing mothersbecause they are no more effective than mild analgesics or breastsupports and may do harm.   FDA officials plan to meet soon with drug companies about gettingthem to agree to stop marketing the medicines for that purpose.   ``I'm sure we'll agree to ask the companies to comply with therecommendations of the committee,'' Philip A. Corfman, executivesecretary of the advisory committee and FDA's supervisory medicalofficer for fertility and maternal health drugs, said Friday.   ``The issue is how much further we wish to go in the matter toget them to comply,'' he said. The FDA could withdraw approval foruse of the suppressants for breast engorgement, he said.   The Public Citizen Health Research Group says use of the hormonesand drugs needlessly exposes more than 700,000 new mothers to healthrisks. Jennifer R. Niebyl, a physician on the FDA committee said thepain is ``significant'' for only 10 percent of the women who get thedrug.   Corfman said the estrogen and androgen hormones and theircombinations have been shown to raise the risk of blood clots.   Bromocriptine is associated with a small number of seizures,strokes and heart attacks, he said.   The drug is made by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. of East Hanover,N.J., and sold under the name Parlodel.   David L. Winter, a spokesman for Sandoz, said studies have found``no provable connection'' between bromociptine and the adverseeffects Corfman cited.   ``We believe it's an issue of choice as to whether a womanchooses to take a pharmacologic approach,'' Winter said.   The company agrees the drug should not be used as a routinetherapy for non-nursing mothers, he said. ``However, we feel thereis a subset of women who for many different reasons cannot or choosenot to breast-feed should have the options explained to them,''including the use of bromocriptine, he said.   More than 4 million women have used bromocriptine in the nineyears it has been on the market and few adverse effects have beenreported, Winter said.   He said the FDA has not contacted the company.   The advisory group addressed only the use of hormones and thedrug bromocriptine to stop milk production in non-nursing mothers.Bromocriptine, for which lactation suppression is the major use, andthe hormones have several other approved uses, and those otherapprovals would not be affected by withdrawal of FDA approval forlactation suppression.</TEXT></DOC>
