But Israel's efforts are being slowed, in part, by a deadlockamong U.S. agencies over whether to allow two Israeli researchinstitutions and the government-owned Israel Military Industries tobuy supercomputers, according to the report and to experts onnuclear proliferation.   Published reports over the past 10 days that Israel helped SouthAfrica develop a ballistic missile that could carry nuclearwarheads are expected to reduce Israel's chances of acquiring suchcomputers, said experts and sources familiar with the case.   An inter-agency team has been debating the request forsupercomputer export licenses to Israel, Brazil and India for twoyears. Supercomputers are manufactured only in the United Statesand Japan, and their export from this nation must be approved bythe federal government because they can be used in weaponsproduction.   ``Selling supercomputers to countries that may be pursuingnuclear weapons or long-range ballistic missiles would be anextremely ill-advised move,'' Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said thisweek.   Gary Milholin, an expert on the proliferation of nuclear weaponsand a law professor at the University of Wisconsin, said if theUnited States grants Israel a license for a supercomputer ``thelikelihood of its being used to make missiles and bombs is verygreat.''   A report prepared in April 1987 for the Department of Defensesaid Israel was ``developing the kind of (computer) codes whichwill enable them to make hydrogen bombs.''   However, ``the Israelis do not yet have the capability to carryout these kinds of calculations'' for the necessary codes,according to the report prepared by the Institute for DefenseAnalyses.   ``As far as nuclear technology is concerned, the Israelis areroughly where the U.S. was in the fission weapon field in about1955 to 1960,'' the report said.   Israel is widely believed to have nuclear weapons, although thegovernment refuses to confirm or deny this.   Research is being conducted at two nuclear facilities, one nearthe Negev Desert town of Dimona and the other at the Sorek facilitysouth of Tel Aviv, according to the report, which was madeavailable to The Associated Press.   The report said the Sorek center works in ``closecollaboration'' with Hebrew University. The university is one ofthe three Israeli institutions seeking to buy a supercomputer, saidanother source.   The other two are the Technion Institute of Technology andIsrael Military Industries.   One source, who was privy to the inter-agency deliberationsuntil recently, said Technion and Hebrew University have bothoffered guarantees that the machines will be used only for academicresearch purposes.   ``It's really a question of how much you trust Israel,'' saidthe source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Proponents of the sale argue that it is beneficial for U.S.manufacturers and that Israel could develop nuclear bombs withoutthe supercomputer, although it would take longer.   Technion, in a pamphlet to its supporters, said ``a projecttaking one month on a supercomputer would require over eight yearson the equipment currently available.''   Critics of the supercomputer deal argue that Israel, India andBrazil should not get the machines because they have not signed theNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which seeks to prevent the exportof nuclear weapons technology.   South Africa recently tested a medium-range ballistic missilebuilt with Israeli help, U.S. officials say. Israel is also helpingSouth Africa develop a long-range missile similar to its own Shavitthree-stage rocket, according to the officials.</TEXT></DOC>
