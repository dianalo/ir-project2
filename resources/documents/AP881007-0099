New studies reported Thursday by the Centers for Disease Controlfound that use of smokeless tobacco among Indian teen-agers onreservations is higher than among rural non-Indian adolescents;that Indians start using it at a younger age; and that boys andgirls alike show frequent use of it on Indian reservations.   As many as 21 percent of kindergarten children on reservationsuse smokeless tobacco, the researchers said, and by the time theyreach high school age, 37 percent already show related signs ofmouth disease.   Smokeless tobacco _ such as snuff and chewing tobacco _ causesmouth cancer and other oral disease, and can produce nicotineaddiction similar to that of cigarette smoking, according tofederal health officials.   The CDC did not speculate on reasons for the increased use ofsmokeless tobacco by reservation youths, but said more research isneeded.   In a 1986 survey on the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation inrural South Dakota, 37 percent of the students in grades 7-12 and18 percent of those in grades kindergarten-6 said they regularlyused smokeless tobacco _ including 21 percent of the kindergartenpupils.   In grades K-6, boys used smokeless tobacco more often than girlsby a margin of 21 percent to 15 percent. But by grades 7-12, themargin was only 39 percent to 35 percent.   By contrast, the U.S. Office on Smoking and Health estimatesthat 2 percent of U.S. adult men and 0.5 percent of adult women usesmokeless tobacco. An estimated 22 million Americans have used it.   Another survey, comparing non-Indian children in rural Minnesotawith their Indian counterparts on four rural South Dakotareservations, found the Indian youth 10 times more likely to usesmokeless tobacco _ 34 percent to 3.4 percent. That was despite thefact that ``both groups lived outside urban areas and would beexpected to share certain characteristics,'' the CDC said.   That same survey suggested ``that this behavior is notnecessarily learned from parents,'' the CDC said. Indianadolescents reported that only 14 percent of their fathers and 3percent of their mothers had ever used smokeless tobacco.   Smokeless tobacco use, however, was much lower among urbanIndians than their counterparts on reservations. A survey ofIndians on Montana's Blackfeet Reservation and in the city of GreatFalls, Mont., found that while 19 percent of the males 15-24 in thecity used smokeless tobacco, on the reservation, the percentage was57. A similar difference was reported among young women, 3 percentto 12 percent.   That same survey found sharp differences in use among youngIndians and their parents. Twenty percent of the Blackfeet men over34 and 3 percent of the women over 34 used smokeless tobacco,compared again to 57 percent and 12 percent among the 15-24 agegroups.</TEXT></DOC>
