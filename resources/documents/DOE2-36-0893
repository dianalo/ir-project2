Examples of powders manufacturedby several different processes, such as (1) spray drying, (2) spray dryingand sintering, (3) sintering and crushing, (4) casting and crushing,and (5) casting, crushing, and fusing, were initially characterized forparticle size and shape, microstructure and morphology, surface area,density, flow characteristics, and qualitative phase distribution. Thepowder manufacturing process did have significant effects on all theabove characteristics. The powders were air plasma sprayed using identicalspray parameters and fixturing on a Hastelloy-X substrate which had beenVacuum Plasma Sprayed (VPS) NiCrAlY bond coated. The coated samples werecharacterized for microstructure, erosion resistance, and quantitativephase distribution. The coatings predominantly contained the tetragonalphase, even when the starting powder material was monoclinic. The moreporous coatings appeared to withstand a greater number of thermal cycles.In these sequences, coarser powders tended to produce longer-lived coatingsthan powders with a relatively low mean powder size. Also, coatings exhibitingmodest (andgt; 5%) fractions of monoclinic phase appeared to withstand lessnumber of thermal cycles than those containing only tetragonal or cubicphases. In addition, the thermal cycling exposure tended to induce atransformation of all the available phases to tetragonal form. Improvementsin the thermal cycle performance of certain spray dried examples wereachieved after resizing, but the improvement achieved did not approachthe levels observed in sintered or cast or fused powder structures. 14references, 16 figures, 5 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
