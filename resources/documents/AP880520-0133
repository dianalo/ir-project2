All new contracts for research and development work also havebeen put on hold temporarily, as have purchases of everything frommagazine and newspaper subcriptions to television sets, librarymaterials, recreation equipment, lawn mowers and furniture.   Tools, paint, lumber, air conditioners and forklifts also are onthe prohibited list for the time being, as are plans to lease cars,office space or computer equipment.   The new restrictions, ordered by Deputy Defense SecretaryWilliam H. Taft IV, will remain in place at least through June 30.   They were prompted by the terms of a deficit-reductioncompromise reached by President Reagan and Congress last November.That compromise was crafted to control government outlays _ theamount of money actually spent during a fiscal year.   Within the Defense Department, however, the number that countsis one known as budget authority _ the amount of money that can beobligated, regardless of when it is going to be spent.   For example, if Congress authorizes $100 million for the Navy tobuy a new ship, the Navy has $100 million in multi-year budgetauthority but might pay out only $10 million for work performed thefirst year.   All that makes it difficult for the Pentagon to projectprecisely how much it will pay out in a fiscal year; a contractormight get more or less work done than originally expected.   Taft said the Pentagon now has to worry as well about the fiscal1988 outlay estimate contained in the deficit-reduction agreement _$277.3 billion.   ``One dollar of obligations almost always results in one dollarof outlays,'' he told reporters.   ``Whether it results in a dollar of outlays on Sept. 28 (fiscal1988) as opposed to Oct. 2 (fiscal 1989) certainly shouldn't be alarge management concern. And yet, because of the focus on thedeficit, which is toted against outlays, this is our problem ....''   Based on spending reports received in March and April, theDefense Department is paying out dollars at a rate that by the endof the year on Sept. 30 would put outlays some $2.5 billion abovethe $277.3 billion total, Taft said.   While the outlay totals for those two months might be ``anaberration'' and spending will even out in future months, thePentagon can't take any chances, Taft said, ``so we are trying toget at discretionary spending that can be deferred for six weeks....''   The spending hold will probably slow only about $500 million inoutlays, Taft said, but that will start attacking the problem whilefigures for May are compiled and officials see just how serious aproblem they have.   One wild card in the projections involves the value of thedollar against foreign currencies, Taft said. Up to $1 billion ofthat $2.5 billion in faster-than-expected outlays was needed toshore up allowances for soldiers overseas, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
