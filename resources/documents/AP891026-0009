Thus ended a week of revealing, curvy, feminine clothes.   Saint Laurent on Wednesday left fashion-watchers panting in thesteamy tent with the hot cuts and colors.   The king of chic looked more at ease than in many a season. Hetook a bow after the show, surrounded by his models wearing draped,thigh-split skirts, bodices revealing bosoms, and flirtatiousCarmen Miranda dresses that left no doubt that sex is in, and evenchic.   After a tentative beginning of laced khaki poplin safariminiskirts and bush jackets worn with thigh boots and toweringturban wraps, Saint Laurent took off in a show that combinedelegance and daring.   It was both subtle and versatile. For those with a figureproblem, he brought out some loose smock dresses in hot-weathercottons, most original with flowered appliques on the huge puffsleeves and yokes.   Those who looked beyond the sexy clothes could find old favoriteclassics: good sailors' blousons, a superb tomato red jersey shift,swingy ochre short coats or trenches with dark, lean skirts andbelted tunics.   But the come-hither message was clear. Even trouser suits haddaringly low-cut jackets, the bosom more evident than the shapelyshoulders, jacket lapels often cut way down in this softly sexycollection to make way for the prominent female curves.   A flowered, fitted white pique jacket with a sweetheart necklinetopping cropped wide pants was as gay as a spring morning.   For extra flower power, he plastered big red poppies diagonallyon bodices and skirts of fitted short suits.   The dark silk and linen suits with mother-of-pearl pastillebuttons up sleeves and jackets were cut curvily with tulip-shapedlong jackets, and beautifully draped skirts were oftenasymmetrically wrapped to give an even more titillating leg show.   Saint Laurent went to town with the polka-dotted flounced CarmenMiranda minis and flamenco dresses, short in front, dipped in back.   There's no doubt that when Saint Laurent goes overboard, he doesit with class. The gaucho girls in leather outfits overloaded withmulticolored cabochon-glass decor and sequins on boleros had acertain cachet, though the costumes would be hard to wear anywhereexcept to a psychedelic Dallas barbecue.   For torso emphasis, Saint Laurent would wrap the body in tighttaffeta draping, with a tiny shocking pink leather bolero on top, alean violet shiny leather skirt below.   Temperatures went down somewhat as Saint Laurent relaxed to showsome modest draped crepe dinner dresses, and just one classicsatin-lapelled black dinner suit.   But the dinner suit turned into a black crepe and satin haremtuxedo, the midriff bare to below the navel, the skirt and tinybodice cut to show every curve. It was quite pretty with an organzacoat flung over it like a transparent cloud.</TEXT></DOC>
