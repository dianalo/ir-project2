<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-69-0294 </DOCNO><TEXT>Studies effect of various fuel combustion products on acid-saline corrosionof brick linings in reinforced concrete smoke stacks. Provides detailsof investigations carried out by several institutions (VNIIK, Soyuztekhehnergo,and others) into methods of determining wall temperatures correspondingto maximum corrosion rates, as well as upper levels of marked corrosionzones. Gives formulae for more accurate determination of the effect ofamounts of ash (with various levels of calcium and magnesium oxides)in fuels used in power plants for evaluating smoke stack thermal zonecorrosion. Lower corrosion levels can be determined by direct measurementswith the help of the Johnston and ORGREhS methods. 3 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
