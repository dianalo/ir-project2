U.K. Trade Secretary Lord Young told a capital markets conference here yesterday that Section 62 of the act will come &quot;into force six months after the main powers of the act are implemented.&quot; Section 62 allows investors to sue a financial firm for regulatory breaches that result in financial losses.    Lord Young said the &quot;temporary breathing space&quot; will allow firms operating under Britain's new securities regulatory framework to &quot;sort out initial teething problems&quot; in coping with the new rules. The move, he said, reflects government concern that the new regulatory arrangement &quot;not lead to business being driven away from the U.K.&quot;    Securities houses worried that the rule would sharply increase the number of lawsuits and the amount of damages. But Lord Young stressed that despite the postponement, guaranteeing investors the right to civil action remains a major aim of the new regulatory structure.    Securities executives welcomed the move. The delay &quot;is very reassuring because it will give us time to get the new (regulatory) regime bedded down,&quot; said Andrew Large, group chief executive of Swiss Bank Corp. International and chairman of the Securities Association.    Mr. Large said the delay gives firms about a year to get their compliance systems in order. He suggested the Securities Association and its members look for ways to simplify the legalistic rule books to make them easier to understand. &quot;We will use the extra time to our best advantage,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
