Sam Nujoma, president of the South West Africa People'sOrganization, met with senior U.S. officials on Thursday and calledon the United States to pressure ``the racist South Africanregime'' into granting independence and black majority rule toNamibia, Africa's last colony.   Nujoma visited the State Department after talks earlier thisweek in London with officials from the United States, South Africa,Angola and Cuba.   Among the issues they discussed was the situation in Namibia,where Nujoma's forces have fought South African colonial rule formore than two decades.   The United States and South Africa believe independence forNamibia should be linked to the withdrawal of the more than 40,000Cuban troops from Angola.   ``We hope the U.S. will not continue to insist on linkingNamibia's independence with the withdrawal of Cuban troops,''Nujoma said, reaffirming a long-standing position, after hismeeting with Michael Armacost, the State Department's third rankingofficial.   ``We don't want that linkage. SWAPO disagrees with thatlinkage,'' he said, adding that SWAPO is ready to sign a cease-firewith South Africa.   Nujoma said he wants immediate implementation of a U.N. SecurityCouncil resolution that sets down procedures for a transition to anindependent government in Namibia.   South Africa would benefit from an independent Namibia, he said,because the war is a drain on South African resources and theoccupation army has been suffering numerous casualties.   While supporting independence for Namibia, the United States hasbeen wary of SWAPO because it has received Soviet backing foryears. Nujoma expressed hope that the ``atmosphere ofreconciliation'' between the United States and the Soviet Unionwill speed the independence process in Namibia.</TEXT></DOC>
