McNulty,associate director for computer security at NIST's National Computer SystemsLaboratory.andP;  The $6 million &quot;would have made us a serious player,&quot; McNultysaid.andM;&quot;As it is, we're a minor player,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;It was unexpected because the authorizing committees had given us support onthis issue,&quot; said Thomas A. Gary, NIST budget officer.andP;  The computer securityissue lacks the political importance that would guarantee congressionalsupport, he said.andM;In the budget conference, Rep.andP;  Neal Smith (d-Iowa) led the push to freezecomputer security spending at the fiscal 1989 level.andM;Smith also succeeded in quashing another OMB-supported $14.8 million for newNIST programs.andP;  Based on this anticipated funding, agency officials hadear-marked $2.1 million for light-wave fiber-optic research, a programrelated to the agency's work on the Integrated Services Digital Network, and$3.1 million to expand NIST's own scientific computing systems.andM;Both executive branch and congressional observers said they suspected Smithforced the freeze because NIST officials fought a fiscal 1989 appropriationof $7.5 million from NIST's budget to fund a special research testingfacility at Iowa State University's School of Science and Technology.andP;  Nistofficials balked at the funding because the Iowa center does research thatthe National Science Foundation, not NIST, usually supports, sources said.andM;Smith is famous for this kind of action, said one House official, who added,&quot;I think it's a pretty clear explanation for what happened.&quot;andM;Smith's office referred questions to the staff of the House AppropriationsSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary and RelatedAgencies, which he chairs.andP;  Subcommittee staff were unavailable for comment.andM;During the budget conference, Sen.andP;  Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) argued withSmith, but he would not budge, one congressional staff member said.andP;  Hollingschairs the same appropriations subcommittee in the Senate.andM;&quot;No one expected the House conferees to be so firm,&quot; another congressionalstaff member said.andM;Though NIST officials had not completed their assessment of the ramificationsof the congressional action, there will be some fallout, McNulty said.andM;&quot;We'll have to go back and re-evaluate our 1990 plans,&quot; he said.andM;NIST officials will not kill any programs, nor will they reduce staff, butthe reduced funding will curtail planned expansion of the computer securityprogram, said Gary.andM;&quot;We would have preferred some support for our core functions and basicresearch,&quot; Gary said.andP;  The lower funding means NIST &quot;won't&quot; be able to moveahead on some things we wanted to do,&quot; he said.andM;But NIST officials already plan to request the additional funding for 1991,Gary said.andP;  Work on that budget proposal is under way now.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
