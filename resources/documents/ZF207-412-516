(products).andO;Ticker:    LOTS.andO;Product:   Lotus 1-2-3 2.2 (Spreadsheet software).andO;Topic:     UpgradingEvaluationSpreadsheets.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>LIFE WITH RELEASE 2.2andM;Installing a new upgrade of a familiar product is always a rush.andP;  No matterwhat you've read about the product, it's fun to see each of the new feauturesand commands in action.andP;  Working for the first time with 1-2-3 Release 2.2was like participating in the annual Easter egg hunt-albeit after a long waitsince the last hunt.andM;Something you'll notice about the installation procedure.andP;  The Installprogram doesn't lead you through hard-disk installation.andP;  This is becauseRelease 2.2 isn't copy-protected.andM;In fact, before you run the Install program in Release 2.2, you run a programcalled Init.andP;  The Init program asks you to enter your name and your company'sname and records your entries on the 1-2-3 System Disk.andP;  From then on, youcan copy the 1-2-3 program files to any computer as often as necessary.andP;  Butdon't get carried away.andP;  It's still illegal to copy your software for otherpeople to use.andM;You might not notice, but Release 2.2 loads quickly.andP;  In fact, when you type1-2-3 in DOX and press Return, expect to be using the spreadsheet in abouthalf the time you're used to waiting.andP;  This may be a minor improvement overearlier releases of the product, but it's one of several features thatcontribute to the new software's feel of high performance.andM;What's New and BetterandM;Once inside the spreadsheet, it's hard to decide where to start describingall the new stuff they've crammed into the product.andP;  The only differenceyou'll notice in the worksheet display is the Undo indicator at the bottom ofthe screen.andP;  The indicator tells you that the built-in &quot;Undo&quot; feature isactive.andP;  Should you make a mistake that in some way alters the contents ofthe worksheet, you can instantly recover from the mistake by simply holdingdown the Alt key and pressing F4.andM;The UNDO key even reverses a File Retrieve operation.andP;  This means that whenyou retrieve one file and then retrieve a second one, you can flip from onefile to the other repeatedly and instantaneously.andP;  Making direct comparisonsbetween files is a snap.andM;When you select/Worksheet Status from an empty worksheet, you'll be able toconfirm that Release 2.2 uses just over 35K of RAM more than Release 2.01.andO;It's unlikely you'll miss the 35K unless you're already pushing the limits ofyour computer's memory.andM;While the worksheet-status screen shows only a minor reduction in total RAM,even in a blank worksheet half of the RAM seems to be in use.andP;  This isbecause the Undo feauture reserves memory in which to keep track of yourefforts.andP;  Should a worksheet grow so large that it uses more than half thetotal RAM, you'll need to disable the Undo feature.andM;When you start from Ready mode and select /Worksheet Global, you discoveranother new feature: setting sheets.andP;  This particular settings sheet revealsthe same information you see when you select /Worksheet Status.andP;  However, thesettings sheet remains visible while you make a selection from the Globalmenu.andP;  This means no more guessing which settings you've changed and whichstill need to be done.andM;There are settings sheets now associated with the Graph menu, the Print menu,the Data Query menu, the Data Sort menu, the Data Regression menu, the DataParse menu, and the Worksheet Global Default menu.andP;  Each setting sheetoverlays the worksheet when you access the appropriate menu.andP;  However, if youprefer an unobstructed view of the worksheet, you can press the WINDOW key(F6 on most computers), and the settings sheet will vanish.andP;  Pressing WINDOWa second time makes the settings sheet reappear.andM;Settings sheets will make learning 1-2-3 easier for people who are new to theprogram.andP;  Spreadsheet veterans might find the interruptions annoying and feelthe need to hit the WINDOW key.andM;Global SettingsandM;In 1-2-3 Release 2/2.01, you can select Zero from the Worksheet Global menuand suppress the display of zero values in the worksheet.andP;  Release 2.2 goes astep beyond a global zero suppression.andP;  You can elect to have 1-2-3 displaythe lable of your choice--UNK, perhaps--in place of every zero value.andM;When you select /Worksheet Global Default from Ready mode, 1-2-3 displays asettings sheet associated with an expanded Global Default menu.andP;  The menu nowoffers an Autoexec option.andP;  You can select Autoexec No to prevent a macronamed \0 in any worksheet you retrieve later from running automatically.andM;The option Other on the Global Default menu leads to yet another expandedmenu.andP;  This menu's Undo selection lets you enable and disable the Undofeature.andP;  On this menu you also have the option of turning off the infernalbeep that announces every little error you make while working with 1-2-3.andO;Heaven forbid that anyone overhear your computer declaring your actionsinvalid.andM;There are a few options you can set by making selections from the WorksheetGlobal Default Other menu.andP;  For example, you now have the option ofdisplaying negative numbers in the Comma and Currency formats either inparentheses or preceded by a minus sign.andP;  You can also elect to display thename of the current worksheet in place of the date and time indicator in thebottom-left corner of the screen.andM;Finally, the Add-In option on the Worksheet Global Default Other menu revealsa feature of the new release that sets it way ahead of its predecessor.andP;  TheAdd-In Manager is built into the spreadsheet software.andM;To use add-ins in 1-2-3 Release 2/2.01, you needed to include the Add-InManager in your driver set.andP;  In Release 2.2 you access the Add-In Managermenu by selecting Add-In from the main menu.andP;  You can attach add-ins to anyof the following keys: F7, F8, F9, and F10.andP;  Once you've attached an add-inin this way, you access it by holding down the Alt key and pressing theadd-in's associated function key.andP;  The Add-In default setting lets youindicate which add-ins should attach automatically when you start up 1-2-3.andM;Add-Ins Come of AgeandM;Two of the more popular add-ins from Lutos Development Corp. simply have nouse in 1-2-3 Release 2.2.andP;  The add-ins Lotus Speedup and Lotus Learn areavailable as part of the Lotus 1-2-3 Value Pack.andP;  Now the features availablein both are built into the 1-2-3 Release 2.2 spreadsheet.andM;The feature in Release 2.2 that is the equivalent of Speedup is calledoptimal recalculation.andP;  It is in effect when recalculation order is set toNatural, the default.andP;  It decreases the amount of time you waste waiting for1-2-3 to recalculate the worksheet.andP;  Earlier releases of the programrecalculate every formula each time you change even a single cell entry.andO;Release 2.2 recalculates the formulas that rely on the cell or cells youchange, plus any @functions whose values vary constantly notably @NOW and@RAND, as well as the following functions @@, @CELL, @CELLPOINTER,@DATEVALUE, @STRING, @TIMEVALUE, and @VALUE.andM;You access the feature of Release 22 that does the work of the Learn add-inby selecting /Worksheet Learn.andP;  After you identify the Learn range, in which1-2-3 can record every keystroke you make, you activate Learn mode bypressing the LEARN key, Alt-F5.andP;  We'll say more about Learn mode in thefollowing article on macros.andM;With the Speedup and Learn add-ins now obsolete, what does Loius offer thatwill compel anyone to use the Add-In feature?andP;  The answer is Alluays, whichcomes as part of the Release 2.2 package.andM;Allways is a program that lets you customize spreadsheet printouts wellbeyond the customization attainable with 1-2-3 alone.andP;  You'll find a goodintroduction to the program on page 75 of the March issue.andM;Within the Allways environment, you can alter the height of rows, change thestyle of text, add underlining within cells, and even incorporate graphsdirectly into the printout.andP;  The changes you make in Allways do not appear onscreen when you view the worksheet in 1-2-3.andP;  However, when you print fromwithin the Allways environment, what you see on the screen is what you get inthe printout.andP;  The integration of Allways and 1-2-3 is so complete that mostpeople can exploit its features without even reading the documentation.andM;A second add-in that comes with Release 2.2 is the Macro Library Manager,nicknamed Hyperspace.andP;  For macro enthusiasts who are tired of recreatingtheir favorite macros in every worksheet, Hyperspace is the answer.andP;  Thisadd-in, long available to users of Symphony, lets you store macros and otherworksheet ranges in RAM, separate from any worksheet.andP;  For more, see the nextarticle.andM;Linking, Locking, and BackupandM;You won't find the feature listed on a menu, but you will be able to applyit.andP;  The feature?andP;  File linking.andM;Lotus hasn't provided the most robust file-linking mechanism you mightimagine.andP;  For example, you can't write a formula in one worksheet that sums arange of cells from another worksheet.andP;  Still, it's now easy to createformulas in one file that rely for their results on the contents of otherfiles.andM;You can link only single cells.andP;  But you can create as many of those linksbetween any two files as you wish.andM;Suppose that you wish to consolidate the values from cell B20 of differentworksheets named JAN, FEB, and MAR.andP;  Each of the values in cell B20 of thesemonthly worksheets would be the summation of a column of other values.andO;Historically, you'd use the File Combine Add command to perform thesummation.andP;  In Release 2.2, you can write four formulas.andM;In a worksheet that you have named TOTALS, for example, you could enter theformula +andless;andless;JANandgt;andgt;B20 in cell B3, +andless;andless;FEBandgt;andgt;B20 in cell B4, and +andless;andless;MARandgt;andgt;B20 incell B5.andP;  The you'd write an @SUM formula to add the values in range B3..B5of this new worksheet.andM;While you can write formulas that link only one cell at a time from anotherworksheet, the references in each of these formulas behave just like otherrelative cell references.andP;  For example, if you copied the formula +andless;andless;JANandgt;andgt;B20one column to the right, the cell reference in the copy would then read+andless;andless;JANandgt;andgt;C20.andP;  It would return the value from cell C20 of the worksheet namedJAN.WK1.andM;Running on a network?andP;  Then you probably have some files that get passedaround from user to user.andP;  When you use Release 2.2 to retrieve a file from aserver, there's a risk that other users are also retrieving the file.andP;  If youmake changes and then save your copy of the file to the server disk, othersmight then save their copy of the file and wipe out your changes.andM;Automatic locking prevents this type of accident.andP;  The first person whoretrieves a file gets a lock on it.andP;  This way anyone who retrieves the filewhile it's still in use won't be able to save it under the original filename.andP;  Other users are free to look at the file without making changes.andP;  Youcan ask to be next in line to change a file by using the File AdminReservation Get command.andP;  Control of the file passes to you when the personwith the original lock is finished.andM;Once youhve retrieved a file from a network server, you can elect to forfeityour exclusive right to change the file by using the File Admin ReservationRelease command.andP;  Then anyone else using the file can use the File AdminReservation Get command to reserve the file.andP;  In any case, 1-2-3 respects anysecurity mechanisms built into the network itself.andM;But suppose that the file you're using has formulaic links to other files onthe network server?andP;  It could be that someone else retrieves one of the otherfiles, makes some changes, and resaves the file.andP;  You may not know this hashappened, but you can quickly update your worksheet's formulas by selecting/File Admin Link-Refresh.andP;  1-2-3 automatically updates file-linking formulasas it retrieves a worksheet.andM;The same menu that manages your control over files on network serversprovides the option of creating a table of file names in the worksheet.andP;  TheFile Admin Table command lists file names, file creation dates and times inserial format, and file sizes of whatever category of file you select.andP;  Forexample, you can elect to list Worksheet, Print, Graph, or Linked files, orlist all files in the working subdirectory.andP;  Or you can override the menuselections and list files that have extensions of your choosing.andM;There's one other file-handling feature of particular note: the File SaveBackup command.andP;  If you've already saved the current file, saving it againunder the same file name produces a confirmation menu.andP;  In Release 2/2.01 theconfirmation menu simply reminds you that a disk file of the same name existsand asks whether you want to replace it.andP;  In Release 2.2 the menu offers theoption of backing up the earlier file name.andP;  When you select Backup, 1-2-3renames the existing disk file with a BAK extension, then saves the currentfile using the same file name with the .WK1 extension.andM;Graphs and GroupsandM;One of the complaints about 1-2-3 Release 2/2.01 is that it lacks manypopular types of graphs.andP;  Release 2.2 also lacks those graph types.andO;Necessarily, the new graphics features of Release 2.2 are subtle improvementsover the features of Release 2.01.andP;  To add graph types, we hear, Lotusprogrammers would have to change the worksheet file format.andP;  This would makeRelease 2.2 files incompatible with Release 2.01.andM;Still, there are some treasures with the new graphics.andP;  For example, theGraph Group command lets you indicate a range of values for 1-2-3 to divideinto discrete data ranges.andP;  When you select Columnwise, each of the columnsin the specified range becomes a graph range.andP;  When you select Rowwise, eachof the rows becomes a graph range.andM;The Graph Name Table command is another nice addition.andP;  It creates in theworksheet a three-column table that lists each graph name, type, and firstline of the title.andP;  The command works much like the more familiar Range NameTable command.andM;Lotus programmers changed a few features to improve the display of graphs.andO;For example, the largest value in a graph no longer defines the location ofthe graph's borders.andP;  A graph's frame automatically falls beyond the datadisplayed.andM;Release 2.2 outlines the bars in a bar chart.andP;  This gives them more weightand keeps the hatchings in adjacent bars from running together.andP;  Also, whenyou elect to show a bar chart on a grid, 1-2-3 no longer superimposes thegrid on the graph.andP;  Rather, the bars of the graph hide the grid lines.andM;When you crowd too many data points into a graph in Release 2.01, the X-axislabels overlap and can become illegible.andP;  Release 2.2 can display more valuesbefore the X-axis labels become crowded.andP;  When things get tight, Release 2.2automatically staggers the entries that appear beneath the X axis.andM;A Few Other TidbitsandM;There's one feature in 1-2-3 Release 2.2 that users have been reproducing foryears by writing their own macros.andP;  That is the ability to set the widths ofseveral columns using a single command sequence.andM;If you have two or more adjacent columns whose widths you wish to adjust, inRelease 2.2 you can select /Worksheet Column Column-Range Set-Width, indicatethe range of columns, then indicate a width.andP;  To return a range of columns tothe worksheet's default column width, you use the Worksheet ColumnColumn-Range Reset-Width command.andM;Do you change your mind a lot as you work in a spreadsheet? There's a newcommand especially for you.andP;  The Search command on the Range menu provides anautomatic search and replace facility.andP;  You indicate the range you wish tosearch, then enter a string.andP;  You can elect to search for the string withinformulas, within labels, or within both formulas and labels.andM;Then Release 2.2 offers the option of replacing the found string with a newstring of your choosing.andP;  You can replace the Search string in selectedentries or in all entries in the range.andM;The implementation of the Range Search command is as smooth as you'd expectin a typical word processor.andP;  However, it lets you search only for valuesthat reside in formulas.andP;  This means you can't use the Range Search commandto find specific values or values that contain specific digits.andP;  Somehow, ina spreadsheet environment, this seems like an oversight.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
