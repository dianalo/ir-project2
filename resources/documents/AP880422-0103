Gorbachev suggested to Secretary ofState George P. Shultz today that ``we're marking time'' insuperpower relations as hope for a new arms control accord faded.   But Shultz disagreed. ``From our point of view, we are far frommarking time,'' he said. ``We are keeping time in a very strongway.''   Shultz differed with the Soviet leader's appraisal at a newsconference after a three-hour session. But Shultz did not list anarms reduction treaty as one of the ``significant achievements'' tobe expected when President Reagan meets with Gorbachev in a Moscowsummit May 29-June 2.   In fact, Shultz said, ``the going is hard'' to complete a pactto reduce strategic nuclear weapons in the five weeks remaining.   ``It's pick and shovel work,'' he said.   Shultz's session with Gorbachev in the gilded Catherine's Hallfollowed nine hours of talks with Foreign Minister Eduard A.Shevardnadze over two days.   When Shultz told the Soviet leader: ``I'm here to makepreparations for the president's visit,''   Gorbachev responded: ``As for the substance, it seems that weare losing something. Maybe we're marking time.''   The two men shook hands at the outset, but Gorbachev seemedsomewhat subdued. American reporters were cautioned by Sovietofficials that if they tried to ask questions of Gorbachev duringthe photo-taking session they would not be invited back.   Usually, Gorbachev welcomes a few questions.   There have been reports of a Kremlin power struggle betweenGorbachev and Yegor K. Ligachev, the man reputed to rank second inthe ruling Politburo.   Ligachev is regarded as more conservative than Gorbachev,especially on the Soviet leader's policy of ``glasnost,'' orgreater openness on selected topics. Reports this week have saidLigachev may have been stripped of some of his power.   Shultz made no mention of the reports at his news conference.But he spoke positively of the way U.S.-Soviet relations haveevolved since Gorbachev's rise to power three years ago.   He said Reagan's summit meeting with Gorbachev would have ``avery businesslike tone'' and the two leaders would have ``a greatdeal of substance to talk about.''   Through interpreters, Gorbachev joked a bit with Shultz over themany thousands of miles the American envoy had logged recently intrips to the Middle East, the Soviet Union and Europe.   American officials have virtually abandoned hopes of completinga treaty to reduce long-range nuclear missiles by the time thesummit starts.   On the regional front, there was little superpower cooperation.Despite another appeal by Shultz, the Soviets still declined tosupport an international arms embargo against Iran, which delaysany action by the U.N. Security Council.   A U.S. official told reporters Thursday that a newly submittedSoviet draft on space defense conforms to a tough Soviet line thatcould make weapons cutbacks impossible.   President Reagan hoped to sign a treaty at the summit to reducearsenals of long-range bombers, missiles and submarines by 30percent to 50 percent.   But the Soviets, suspicious of Reagan's ``Star Wars'' program,want a guarantee they could halt the cutbacks if the United Statesconducts tests in space judged to be in violation of the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.   The Reagan administration has strenuously resisted limits on theprogram that seeks a space-based defense against ballistic missiles.   One small note of progress was an agreement on procedures forjoint underground nuclear tests in July. The first test will beheld in the Nevada desert, the other at Semipalatinsk, in theSoviet republic of Kazakhstan.   The idea is to compare U.S. and Soviet techniques for measuringthe extent of the explosions.   In reports to Congress, Reagan has accused the Soviets ofexceeding the 150 kiloton ceiling set in 1974 and 1976 treaties.The Soviets denied the charges.   If the two sides can agree on measurements and make them moreprecise, Reagan may submit the treaties to the Senate forratification before he leaves office next January.   One kiloton is equivalent to the explosion of 1,000 tons of TNT.   Shultz and Shevardnadze, who have held three rounds of talks,will meet again in mid-May, two weeks before Reagan visits Moscow.   In Washington last December, Gorbachev and Reagan signed anaccord ridding both of their nations of medium- and shorter-rangemissiles. They called then for another pact cutting strategic armsby 50 percent, but negotiations in Geneva have been proceedingslowly.</TEXT></DOC>
