The real estate investment trust said the dividend will be suspended because Martin Marietta Corp. canceled a lease covering 65,663 square feet in Linpro's Academy Downs office building in Lakewood, Colo. Last November, the trust said it might have to suspend the quarterly payout because Martin Marietta had purchased a 711,000-square-foot office building in nearby Deer Creek Canyon, Colo. In deciding to suspend its dividend payment, the trust cited the need to reserve cash flow from operations to make future improvements at Academy Downs and elsewhere as well as longer than expected vacancies in several of its properties, notably those in Parsippany, N.J., and Raleigh, N.C. The trust will pay a second-quarter dividend of four cents a share. The dividend will be paid Aug. 31 to stock of record Aug. 17. </TEXT></DOC>
