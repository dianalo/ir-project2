Including my grocery store in Georgia.</LP><TEXT>   Market Metrics, a micromarketing research company inLancaster, Pa., knows far more about my Aandamp;P outside Atlantathan I do. For example, it knows that my Aandamp;P has 10checkouts, all with scanners, 33,900 square feet of sellingspace and average weekly sales of $350,000. It also knowsthat the store has 20 end-of-aisle displays and devotes 150feet of space to both upright freezers and health and beautyproducts. Eight feet go to powdered drinks. And there arefresh-coffee grinders.   According to Market Metrics, which collects facts on30,000 supermarkets around the country, there are exactly14,371 people other than me who shop at my Aandamp;P. In my area,which is made up of nine census tracts, my Aandamp;P is the No. 3store, with a 9% market share. Two nearby Krogers have sharesof 22% and 13%, which I can understand because they're biggerand fancier and cheaper -- and a litter further from my home.   Based on traffic patterns and roads, the easiest access tomy Aandamp;P is from the northeast. Coming from the north and southis difficult. Almost every other direction is average,including due west, where I come from. Market Metrics isdefinitely on to something. Try making a left into theparking lot against oncoming traffic sometime.   The area my store sits in is undergoing enormousdemographic changes, basically from the boonies to the'burbs. First of all, the place is crawling with kids. (Twoare mine, but Market Metrics didn't know that.) Fully 26% ofthe people in my area are no older than 14, and many areunder five. The locals are predominantly white, haveblue-collar jobs, own two cars and live with three or fourpeople in households with average incomes of $42,912,   Marrying the consumption patterns of hundreds of groceryitems with the demographics of my neighbors, Market Metricscan determine precisely what should sell particularly well inmy Aandamp;P. The winners include baby food and grooming items,baking mixes, desserts, dry dinner mixes, fluor, shorteningand oils, cigarettes, laundry supplies, first-aid productsand milk.   The bottom of the list includes sugar and artificialsweeteners, tea, pet food and supplies, books, film,cosmetics, foil, breakfast food, fruit, juice, prepared food,yogurt, liquor and wine.   With so many children, the store should crank up the kidmarketing, says H.W. Clapp Jr., executive vice presidentMarket Metrics. &quot;I'd at least have an Easter Bunny out infront of the store at Easter,&quot; he says, and &quot;Santa Claus atChristmas.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
