The United States and other countries have expressed concernabout the refugees' safety if they are moved from Khao-I-Dang, whicis eight miles from the frontier.   Thousands of Cambodians have entered Thailand to escape the warin their country between guerrilla forces and Vietnamese andgovernment troops. Vietnam sent troops into Cambodia in December1978, ousted the radical Khmer Rouge regime and installed anothercommunist government.   Most of the Cambodians settled in camps along the border, andKhao-I-Dang is considered the only refugee camp not controlled bythe differerent guerrilla groups. It also is the only camp wherethere is an official program to resettle the refugees in othercountries.   Thailand had declared on Dec. 31, 1986, that it would closeKhao-I-Dang, but only a small number of refugees were forced toleave.   Col. Sanan Kajornklam, of the Supreme Command's Joint OperationsCenter, spoke of moving the refugees at a meeting Friday.   Later, in an interview with The Associated Press, Sanan saidthat within three months authorities will start moving theKhao-I-Dang refugees to the area of Site 2 close to the border.Site 2 adjoins the Ban Thad camp where the government, trying todiscourage more Indochinese from entering Thailand, has placedabout 3,000 Vietnamese refugees.   Sanan said the Khao-I-Dang refugees would be resettled becausethey have not been accepted by other countries and they mustprepare to return to Cambodia.   ``If we close Khao-I-Dang, the Cambodians will know that theymust go home,'' Sanan said.   Kobsak Chutikul, director of the Foreign Ministry's SocialAfffairs Division, said that in its plans to move the Khao-I-Dangrefugees the government will follow three objectives that U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar outlined in a letter tothe government last year.   He said those objectives are that the new site be safe, that itbe neutral and that the refugees remain under the protection of theoffice of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.</TEXT></DOC>
