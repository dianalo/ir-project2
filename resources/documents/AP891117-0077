Prosecutors painted Joyce Cohen as a once-poor jet-setter whowas trying to avoid a divorce from Stanley Cohen, while herattorney blamed the slaying on her husband's supposed drugconnections.   A Circuit Court jury Thursday convicted Mrs. Cohen, 39, offirst-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and using afirearm in the commission of the March 7, 1986, shooting at thecouple's upscale house in Coconut Grove.   Cohen, 52, was shot in the head four times.   ``We're very, very relieved,'' said Cohen's brother, ArthurCohen. ``This has been 3{ years. It was hard _ going to the policestation, listening to what the police had found, listening to thetrial.''   Mrs. Cohen was indicted after one of the three hired men, FrankZuccarello, agreed to cooperate in return for immunity.   Zuccarello testified that Mrs. Cohen offered him and two othermen $100,000 to kill her husband. She supplied a map of the house,disconnected security alarms, unlocked the door and even gave themCohen's own gun, Zuccarello testified.   A police expert testified there was gunpowder residue on atissue found in a wastebasket in Mrs. Cohen's bathroom.   Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. The penalty phase ofthe trial was scheduled to begin Monday with the same jury. Mrs.Cohen had been free on $1 million bond but was jailed after herconviction.   Mrs. Cohen's attorney, Alan Ross, tried to blame the killing onher husband's supposed drug connections, a tactic the victim'sbrother called ``a bunch of absolute lies.''   The couple were married for 11 years. Mrs. Cohen was once herhusband's secretary and soon got used to the life of a jet-setter,commuting by private jet to their Colorado ranch and using cocaine,according to testimony.   Prosecutors said the marriage eventually soured. According totestimony, Mrs. Cohen feared a divorce would end her posh lifestyle.   Mrs. Cohen admitted turning off the alarm system and locking upthe dog the night of the murder, but said she had insomnia andwanted the system off while she wandered around the house preparingitems for a garage sale.</TEXT></DOC>
