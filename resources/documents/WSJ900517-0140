Though the results were squarely in line with analysts'expectations, Hewlett-Packard's stock skidded on the news,closing down $1.875 at $46.125 in composite trading on theNew York Stock Exchange. Analysts said management's cautiousforecast of future business and the disclosure that thecompany was losing share in the market for computerworkstations sent the stock tumbling.</LP><TEXT>   The slip in workstations market share is particularlyworrisome since Hewlett-Packard recently was vying with SunMicrosystems Inc. for the top spot in the segment. Last year,Hewlett-Packard bought Apollo Computer Inc., its biggestacquisition ever, with an eye toward commanding a sizableshare of the workstation business, which is growing rapidly.   &quot;From their comments, it's clear that Sun is gaining shareand IBM's entry {into the workstation business} is having animpact on HP,&quot; said Steven Milunovich, an analyst at FirstBoston Corp., referring to comments made by Hewlett-Packardexecutives yesterday during a conference call.   Orders for Hewlett-Packard's personal computers also haveslowed and are flat compared with last year, Mr. Milunovichsaid.   Net income for the quarter totaled $186 million, comparedwith $203 million in the year-ago period. The company hadper-share earnings of 78 cents, down 9% from 86 cents in theyear-ago quarter.   Revenue for the quarter was $3.3 billion, an increase of16% from the year-ago quarter.   Hewlett-Packard, which makes medical equipment,instruments and other electronic goods as well as computers,blamed its lower earnings on a continuing shift in itsbusiness that has made the company more reliant on sales oflower-margin goods such as personal computers and printers.The company said that, in response, it was moving to reduceoperating costs.   For instance, in the second quarter the company said itcut its world-wide work force of 93,000 by 1,000, mainlythrough an early retirement program.   The situation facing Hewlett-Packard is similar to thatfacing International Business Machines Corp., DigitalEquipment Corp. and other makers of minicomputers. As pricesfor computers decline sharply and minicomputers are replacedby smaller, far less expensive machines, these firms arestuck with large, costly direct sales forces that aren't anylonger efficient.   While analysts said Hewlett-Packard is trying to cutcosts, they said the company isn't moving quickly enough.They also don't expect any drastic moves any time soon.   &quot;Progress is slow,&quot; said Peter Rogers, an analyst atRobertson Stephens andamp; Co. &quot;This is another discouragingquarter.&quot;   In a statement, John Young, Hewlett-Packard's chiefexecutive officer, expressed caution about the outlook forthe second half of the company's fiscal year. He called thecompany's results so far this year &quot;mixed&quot; and said that&quot;slower economic growth continues to be a concern in many ofthe countries we serve.&quot;   &quot;My concern is there's a good chance you'll have a sharpslowdown in {the company's} revenues growth in the secondhalf of year,&quot; said Mr. Milunovich. However, he said hewouldn't cut his 1990 earnings estimate of $3.40 a share.</TEXT></DOC>
