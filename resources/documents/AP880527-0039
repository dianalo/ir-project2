Hastings said heremains confident that a House subcommittee will refuse torecommend that he be impeached on charges of conspiring to solicita bribe.   On Thursday, at the end of five days of hearings before theHouse Judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice, Hastings said:``I haven't heard anything new so far. These are old charges. Theyall came up in my trial.''   Asked how he would assess the hearings to date, Hastingsreplied: ``Hastings five, Congress nothing.''   The subcommittee hearings will continue next Wednesday.   Hastings, who still sits on the federal bench in Miami, has beenaccused by an investigative panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals in Atlanta of taking part in a bribery scheme with hisclose friend, Washington lawyer William A. Borders.   Borders was convicted in 1982 of arranging a $150,000 bribe forHastings from two Miami racketeers, Frank and Tom Romano, inexchange for a promise of lenient sentences. One year later, aseparate trial jury acquitted Hastings of conspiring with Bordersto solicit a bribe from the Romano brothers.   Hastings is also charged with compromising an FBI investigationinto zoning code corruption in the Miami area in 1985.   Earlier, FBI agent William J. Murphy Jr., who directed theHastings-Borders investigation, testified at Thursday'ssubcommittee hearing   that Hastings was a target from the beginning of the probe.   Murphy also said that Hastings and Borders weren't illegallylured into taking the bribe even though an undercover FBI agentgave $120,000 to Borders before he was arrested on Oct. 9, 1981.   Murphy said the FBI began the investigation after an informant,William Dredge, had bragged that he controlled several judges,including Hastings and another federal jurist who was notidentified.   He said the undercover operation took place because ``we wereonly trying to prove or disprove what (Dredge) said.''   In answer to a question, Murphy said Hastings ``was a targetfrom the outset. His name was mentioned by Borders. We tried toprove or disprove the allegation and it turned out to be true.''   Rep. Patrick L. Swindall, R-Ga., said that the FBI's undercoveroperation appeared to him to be ``a classic, textbook entrapment.''   Saying he was not an attorney, Murphy replied that he did notbelieve it was entrapment. He said the operation ``was a tool torespond to (Dredge's) allegations. If Borders didn't show up at themeeting and didn't say the things he did, the case would havestopped.   ``The information we were trying to prove or disprove was thatBorders and Judge Hastings were going to do a crime,'' Murphy said.``We didn't decide one day in the office to get Judge Hastings.''</TEXT></DOC>
