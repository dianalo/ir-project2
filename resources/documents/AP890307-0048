Insurgents fighting to establish an Islamic republic hint theyare preparing a decisive battle to bring down the Marxist Kabulgovernment once spring melts snowbound mountain passes, thediplomats said.   ``The battle plans appear likely to be executed roughlysimultaneously, with serious fighting expected in most areas duringthe month,'' one Western source said on condition of anonymity.   Guerrilla spokesmen in neighboring Pakistan said an interimgovernment announced Feb. 24 by the fighters may hold its firstmeeting inside Afghanistan on Thursday.   Washington and Islamabad, the guerrillas' main backers, havewithheld formal recognition of the rival government until itestablishes a capital and begins a functional administration.   ``Regime forces are extremely worried about the imminent massiveassault by the Afghan (guerrillas) in many areas,'' the Afghan NewsAgency of guerrilla leader Gulbaddin Hekmatyar claimed Monday.   It said the insurgents have sent clandestine messages tocivilians to flee eastern Jalalabad city and the southeastern cityof Kandahar. Diplomats earlier reported similar notices in thecapital.   Combined assaults on the key cities of Kabul, Jalalabad, Kandaharand Herat in the west will be tricky.   Guerrilla field commanders have disagreed over timing and tacticsfor fear of causing unnecessary civilian casualties. Many haveargued for an extended siege to encourage defections in hopes thecommunists will collapse from poor morale.   Nearly 1.5 million Afghans, or 10 percent of the population, havedied in the civil war since the ruling People's Democratic Party ofAfghanistan seized power in a 1978 coup.   Soviet forces intervened in December 1979. They withdrew lastmonth after losing 13,000 men.   Western diplomats in Pakistan said commanders based nearJalalabad also are concerned about their ability to control outsizeguerrilla groups that have converged there.   ``(It) could become a problem, entailing unnecessary killing anddestruction,'' said one source.   Combined reports indicate fighting around Afghanistan is on therise after a winter lull.   The guerrillas claim thousands of government troops havesurrendered or been captured since the last Red Army soldiers wenthome on Feb. 15.</TEXT></DOC>
