It'sabout taxes.   That's right, federal income taxes. April 15 in August.   But as much as that sounds like madness, there is some method init. Many taxpayers and the people who advise them have learned fromexperience that it is never too soon to start arranging your affairsto minimize the burden when it comes time to settle up with UncleSam.   ``The ideal would be to start in January,'' said William Brennan,a specialist in the subject with the accounting firm of Ernst andamp;Young.   Tax planning _ some might call it finagling _ is often portrayedas a shadowy activity practiced only by the rich at the expense ofthe ordinary wage-earner.   Note, for example, the court case this summer in which LeonaHelmsley, the New York hotelier accused of tax evasion, was quotedby a witness as saying that ``only the little people'' pay taxes.   Or consider the fuss over whether Malcolm Forbes, the magazinepublisher and bon vivant, might have been entitled to deduct some ofthe expenses of his Morocco birthday extravaganza as a businessexpense (he said he wouldn't anyway).   The morals of the matter may depend on your personal viewpoint.The law on this point, however, is pretty clear.   It was settled long ago by the noted appeals court judge LearnedHand, who decreed that everybody has a perfect right to take allmeasures available within the law to minimize the taxes they owe.   For most of the 1980s, the big tax planning problem has beenadjusting to some just-passed sweeping overhaul of the tax system.This year, for a change, there isn't much that is drastically new.   But there is a lot of uncertainty over changes that might be madein the future.   The betting among the experts is that sooner or later the lowbasic income tax rates set by the 1986 tax reform law will be raisedagain in some way.   ``Before new tax laws became an annual event, sound tax strategygenerally called for deferring part of income and acceleratingcertain expense items to shift some of the tax burden to the nextyear,'' said analysts at Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. in the firm'sweekly publication The Outlook.   ``Now the decision is less clear-cut. But despite prospects forhigher taxes to come, shifting income forward and expenses back isstill the best tax strategy in most cases.''   This kind of maneuver can be as simple as stepping up charitablecontributions so that they are made before New Year's.   ``It's easier to accelerate deductions than to defer income,''observed the accounting firm Laventhol andamp; Horwath in a recent yearendplanning report.   ``The reason is obvious: You control the money you pay out, butnot the money you take in.''   Self-employed people have more flexibility in this regard. Iftheir checkbooks can stand the wait, they can simply delay sendingout bills to customers or clients so that the money won't be paiduntil after 1990 has begun.   One long-cherished deduction for many people continues to fade,on its way to extinction by 1991. Consumer interest is 20 percentdeductible this year, and only 10 percent next.   Says Standard andamp; Poor's: ``Many tax advisors now recommend eitherpaying off such loans early or consolidating them under a homeequity loan of up to $100,000, on which the interest is fullydeductible, regardless of how loan proceeds are used.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Tuesday Aug 29</NOTE></DOC>
