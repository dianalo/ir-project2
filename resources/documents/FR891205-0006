Background on the Virginia Program</ITAG>The Secretary of the Interior approved the Virginia program on December15, 1981. Information pertinent to the general background and revisionsto the Virginia program submission, as well as the Secretary's findings,the disposition of comments and a detailed explanation of the conditionsof approval, can be found in the December 15, 1981, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (46 FR 61085-61115). Subsequent actions concerningthe conditions of approval and proposed amendments are identified at 30CFR 946.12, 946.13, 946.15, and 946.16.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Submission of Amendment</ITAG>By letter dated June 30, 1989 (Administrative Record No. VA-728), Virginiasubmitted a proposed amendment (State Program Amendment Tracking No. VA-0001)to modify the following rules of its Surface Coal Mining Reclamation Regulations:Chapter VR 480-03-19.: 780.14, 773.15, 779.19, 783.19, 779.20, 783.20,780.16, 784.21, 816.97, 817.97, 846, 846.2, 846.12, 846.14, 846.17, 846.18,784.20, 700.11, 764.15, 840.11, 843.22, 785.14, 801.17.Most of the proposed changes respond to recently published Federal rulerevisions or address State operational concerns. Minor changes affect themountaintop removal mining rules and bond release notification rules.OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the August 4, 1989 <T4>Federal Register</T4> (32098-32099), and in the same notice openedthe public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearingon the adequacy of the proposed amendment.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Director's Findings</ITAG>Pursuant to SMCRA and Federal regulations contained at 30 CFR 730.5, 30CFR 732.15, and 30 CFR 732.17, the Director finds the submitted amendment,with the exception of VR 480-03-19.843.22 upon which Federal action isdeferred, to be no less effective than comparable Federal regulations.In support of this finding, the Director specifically finds as follows:1. VR 480-03-19.780.14 Operation Plan: Maps and PlansParagraph (c) would add the requirement that maps, plans and cross sectionsfor each water diversion, collection, conveyance, treatment, storage, anddischarge facility to be used be prepared by, or under the direction of,and certified by a qualified registered professional engineer, or certifiedprofessional geologist with assistance from experts in related fields suchas land surveying and landscape architecture. The Director finds this ruledesign and certification standards to be substantively equivalent to thecorresponding Federal rule at 30 CFR 780.14(c) in referencing paragraph(b)(6) and therefore, no less effective.2. VR 480-03-19.773.15 Review of Permit ApplicationsParagraph (c)(12) would require the Virginia Division of Mined Land Reclamationmake a written finding before permit approval for a proposed remining operation.The site of the operation must be a previously mined area as defined inthe Virginia regulations. The Director finds the proposal to be substantivelyequivalent to the Federal rule at 30 CFR 773.15(c)(12) and therefore, noless effective.3. VR 480-03-19.780.16 and 480-03-19.784.21 Fish and Wildlife InformationThese sections apply to permitting of surface and underground mining activitiesrespectively and the language of each section is the same. Certain substantivelyduplicative text relating to fish and wildlife information has been deletedfrom VR 480-03-19.770.20 and 480-03-19.783.20. Changes in references inVR 480-03-19.779.19 and 480-03-19.783.19 would properly identify the newproposed sections. (a) <T3>Resource information.</T3> Paragraph (a) of these proposed rules wouldrequire each application to include fish and wildlife resource informationfor the permit and adjacent area. It would also require the scope and levelof detail of such information and site-specific information on endangeredor threatened plant or animal species, and animal habitat as necessaryor required. The Director finds paragraph (a) of the proposed rules tobe the substantive equivalent of the Federal rules at 30 CFR 780.16(a)and 784.21(a) and therefore, no less effective. (b) <T3>Protection and enhancement plan.</T3> Paragraph (b) of these ruleswould require a description of protective measures to be used during theactive mining phase, and of enhancement measures to be used during thereclamation and postmining phase that apply to the species and habitatsidentified under proposed paragraph (a) of this section. The Director findsparagraph (b) of these rules to be the substantive equivalent of the Federalrules at 30 CFR 780.16(b) and 784.21(b) and therefore, no less effective.(c) <T3>Fish and Wildlife Service review.</T3> Paragraph (c) of the rules requirethe regulatory authority (Division) to provide fish and wildlife resourceinformation to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service within ten days of receiptof such a request from the Service. The Director finds paragraph (c) ofthese sections to be the substantive equivalent of 30 CFR 780.16(c) and784.21(c) and therefore, no less effective. 4. VR 480-03-19.816.97 and 480-03-19.817.97 Protection of Fish, Wildlife,and Related Environmental Values These sections apply to the performance standards for surface and undergroundmining activities respectively, and the language of each section is substantivelyequal. (a) <T3>Endangered and threatened species.</T3> Paragraph (b) of both sectionswould prohibit mining activities which are likely to result in the destructionor adverse modification of designated critical habitats for federally listedendangered or threatened species. It also requires an operator to promptlyreport to the Division any State or federally listed endangered or threatenedspecies within the permit area of which the operator becomes aware. TheDirector finds the proposed rules to be the substantive equivalent of thecorresponding Federal rules at 30 CFR 816.97(b) and 817.97(b) and therefore,no less effective. (b) <T3>Exclusion of wildlife from toxic ponds.</T3> Subparagraph (e)(4) ofboth sections would require operators to fence cover, or use appropriatemethods to exclude wildlife from ponds which contain hazardous concentrationsof toxic-forming materials. The Director finds the proposed rules to bethe substantive equivalent of the Federal rules at 30 CFR 816.97(e)(4)and 817.97(e)(4) and therefore, no less effective. 5. VR 480-03-19.846 Individual Civil Penalties and 480-03-19.846.2 DefinitionsThis proposal would add a new part to the Virginia program to be consistentwith the Federal program at 30 CFR part 846. The Director finds that thedefinitions for ``knowingly'', ``violation, failure or refusal'', and ``willfully''are the substantive equivalent of the Federal definitions at 30 CFR 846.5and therefore, no less effective. 6. VR 480-03-19.846.12 When an Individual Civil Penalty May Be AssessedParagraphs (a) and (b) of this proposed rule would provide the Divisionwith the authority to assess an individual civil penalty in all circumstanceswhere it is permitted. The Director finds the proposal to be the substantiveequivalent of the Federal rules at 30 CFR 846.12 and therefore, no lesseffective. 7. VR 480-03-19.846.14 Amount of the Individual Civil Penalty Paragraph (a) requires Virginia to consider an individual's history ofprevious violations, the seriousness of the violation, and demonstratedgood faith in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after receiving noticeof infraction. Paragraph (b) would allow Virginia to deem each day of continuingviolation a separate violation for which an individual civil penalty maybe assessed. The Director finds these proposed rules to be the substantiveequivalent of the Federal rules at 30 CFR 846.14 and therefore, no lesseffective. 8. VR 480-03-19.846.17 Assessment of the Individual Civil PenaltyParagraph (a) of this rule would provide notice to an individual beingassessed a penalty to the same extent as the Federal requirements. Paragraph(b) would establish effective dates for assessments and standards for service.The Director finds this rule to be substantively equivalent to the Federalrule at 30 CFR 846.17 and therefore, no less effective.9. VR 480-03-19.846.18 Penalty PaymentThis proposal would establish penalty payment due dates and would providefor withdrawal of the penalty if abatement or compliance is satisfactory.The Director finds the Virginia proposal substantively equivalent to theFederal rule at 30 CFR 846.18 and therefore, no less effective.10. VR 489-03-19.784.20 Subsidence Control PlanThis proposed rule clarifies where and when a subsidence control plan isrequired.(a) <T3>Map of underground workings</T3>. Paragraph (b) of this rule requiresa map of areas in which planned subsidence mining methods will be used.It states that corrective measures would be taken only ``to the extentrequired under State law,'' while the comparable Federal rule at 30 CFR784.20(b) requires that corrective measures be taken ``where appropriate.''Under the operative Virginia regulation at VR 480-03-19.817.121(c)(2),the duty to correct ``to the extent required by state law'' only appliesto the correction of damage caused to structures. However, pursuant toVR 480-03-19.817.121(c)(1) which is the substantive equivalent of the Federalregulation at 30 CFR 817.121(c)(1), the operator must correct ``any materialdamage resulting from subsidence caused to surface lands.'' The proposedlanguage at VR 480-03-19.784.20 does not change these duties imposed uponthe operator. Accordingly, the Director finds the proposed amendment tobe no less effective than comparable federal regulations.(b) <T3>Subsidence monitoring</T3>. Paragraph (d) clarifies that the Divisionhas the authority to require monitoring as part of any subsidence controlplan, regardless of the type of mining proposed. The Director finds thisproposal to be the substantive equivalent of 30 CFR 784.20(d) and therefore,no less effective.11. VR 480-03-19.700.11(b) Two-Acre ExemptionThe Division proposes to delete this rule to reflect the effect of therepeal of the two-acre exemption contained in section 528(2) of SMCRA andof the statutory provisions of Section 45.1-253 of the code of Virginia.The Director finds that the deletion of these provisions would not renderthe Virginia program to be less stringent than SMCRA and no less effectivethan the Federal regulations from which rule 30 CFR 700.11(b) was suspended.12. VR 480-03-19.764.15 Designating Areas Unsuitable for Mining_InitialProcessing, Recordkeeping and Notification RequirementsThe Division proposes to streamline the reviewing of petitions to havean area designated as unsuitable for coal mining by eliminating the hearingprovision on the completeness of petitions under paragraph (b)(2), andby replacing it with a completeness definition under paragraph (a)(1).The Director finds that these revisions would make the Virginia rule substantivelyequivalent to the Federal rule at 30 CFR 764.15.13. VR 480-03-19.840.11 Inspection of Abandoned SitesParagraph (g) and (h) are being added to the Virginia program to clarifythat abandoned mines, where all mining operations have ceased and no oneremains at the site to complete the reclamation, need not be inspectedas frequently as active mines. The Director finds the proposed rules tobe the substantive equivalent of the Federal rules at 30 CFR 840.11 (g)and (h) and therefore, no less effective.14. VR-480-03-19.843.22 Enforcement Actions at Abandoned SitesAction upon this portion of the amendment is deferred to give the Statean opportunity to correct the regulation citation contained within theproposed regulation.15. VR 480-03-19.785.14 Mountaintop Removal MiningThe Director finds that proposed word changes and spelling correctionsin subparagraphs (c)(1)(iii)(G) and (c)(1)(iv) would make the Virginiarules the substantive equivalent of 30 CFR 785.14(c)(1)(iii) and (c)(1)(iv)and therefore, no less effective.16. VR 480.03.19.801.17 Bond Release ApplicationProposed subparagraph (d)(4)(i) would require local government notificationof total or partial bond release of pool bond funds. The Director findsthat the proposed language would be the same as required for other formsof bonds in Virginia's program at VR 480-03-19.800.40(e) and the substantiveequivalent of the requirements contained in the Federal program at 30 CFR800.40(e) and therefore, no less effective.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments</ITAG>Public CommentsThe public comment period and opportunity to request a public hearing announcedin the August 4, 1989 <T4>Federal Register</T4> ended September 5, 1989. No public comments werereceived and the scheduled public hearing was not held as no one requestedan opportunity to provide testimony.Agency CommentsPursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and the implementing regulations of30 CFR 732.17(h), comments were solicited from various Federal agencieswith an actual or potential interest in the Virginia program. The Fishand Wildlife Service (FWS) generally supported the language of the amendmentdescribed under finding 3(c). Other comments by FWS applied to mattersof coordination between FWS and Virginia regulatory authority. Such otherissues are beyond the scope of this State rulemaking proceeding.Director's DecisionBased on the above findings, the Director is approving the proposed amendmentconsisting of revisions, clarifications and corrections as submitted onJune 30, 1989, with the exception of VR 480-03-19.843.22 upon which actionis deferred. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 946 codifying decisionsconcerning the Virginia program are being amended to implement this decision.EPA ConcurrenceUnder 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain thewritten concurrence of the Administrator of the Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) with the respect to any provisions of a State program amendmentwhich relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authorityof the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 <T3>et seq</T3>.) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 <T3>et seq</T3>.). The Director has determined that this amendment containsno such provisions and that EPA concurrence is therefore unnecessary. Asrequired by 30 CFR 732.17(h)(ll)(i), the Director solicited EPA's commentson these changes; however, none were received.Effect of Director's DecisionSection 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdictionunder SMCRA unless the State program is approved by the Secretary. Similarly,30 CFR 732.17(g) prohibits unilateral changes to an approved State program.In his oversight of the Virginia program, the Director will recognize onlythe statutes, regulations, and other materials approved by him, togetherwith any consistent implementing policies, directives, and other materials.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Procedural Determinations</ITAG>Compliance With the National Environmental Policy ActThe Secretary has determined that, pursuant to section 702(d) of SMCRA,30 U.S.C. 1292(d), no environmental impact statement need be prepared onthis rulemaking.Executive Order No. 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility ActOn July 12, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted OSMan exemption from sections 3, 4, 7, and 8 of Executive Order 12291 foractions directly related to approval or conditional approval of State regulatoryprograms. Therefore, this action is exempt from preparation of a regulatoryimpact analysis and regulatory review by OMB.The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not havea significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq</T3>.). This rule will not impose any new requirements establishedby SMCRA and the Federal rules will be met by the State. Paperwork Reduction ActThis does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 30 CFR Part 946</ITAG>Coal mining, Intergovernmental relations, Surface mining, Underground mining.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jeffrey D.
