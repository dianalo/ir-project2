(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Louisiana would lose at least fivemedical institutions and some universities under a budget proposaldrawn up after voters rejected Gov. Buddy Roemer's tax plan, a topbudget official says.   More closures will be disclosed in the next two weeks,Commissioner of Administration Dennis Stine said Monday.   On Saturday, voters rejected Roemer's tax revision plan thatwould have offset much of a projected deficit of abut $700 millionfor the new fiscal year beginning July 1.   ``The cuts will be deeper than I wanted, deeper than commonsense, but we will not do business as usual,'' Roemer said Monday.   The governor was referring to the projecting oil prices highenough to balance the budget on paper, a routine practice before hetook office in March 1988. Roemer has blamed such practices forbuilding up an accumulated $900 million deficit that the statecovered with a bond issue last year.   Each increase of $1 a barrel in the price of oil yields around$28 million a year in extra state tax revenue.   Roemer said the state realistically could increase theprojection from $15 to $17 per barrel because the price ofLouisiana oil is about $18, ``but you're only talking about $60million if we do that.''   Having oil companies and other businesses pay a big share ofstate revenues dates back to the days of populist Gov. Huey Long inthe 1920s and 1930s. Roemer's plan would have shifted the taxburden away from big business, put more of a load on individualsthrough the income tax and cut sales taxes.   Stine, who heads the day-to-day operations of government, saidthe state must lay off a minimum of 3,000 employees. That would bein addition to 4,100 jobs that had been planned to go throughattrition and layoffs even if the tax package had passed, he said.   Stine's office issued a report detailing $74.5 million inproposed cuts through the elimination of state programs.   The budget calls for 33 of the state's 41 vocational-tradeschools to be shut down, said Stine.   Some universities must be closed or a majority of them changedfrom four-year institutions to two-year community colleges, hesaid. The state now has 18 public universities.   ``We could end up with six four-year universities,'' said Stine.   With higher education contributing $113 million to the deficit,``I think you can expect some closures,'' said Stine. ``We're notready to name them.''   Two of the state's eight charity hospitals must be closed, Stinesaid. Medicaid patients would be transferred to private hospitalsand indigents without Medicaid would be transferred to othercharity hospitals, he said.   Also slated for closure is a New Orleans nursing home for olderhandicapped patients and homes in Columbia and Leesville forphysically handicapped children. Those patients would betransferred to other facilities, Stine said.   Stine's report also said another $74.5 million would be saved byeliminating a 7 percent pay raise planned this fall for teachers,while $14.3 million would be garnered by denying state employeesmerit pay hikes.   ``All options are on the table,'' said Stine. ``We are trying todo the best we can within the means available.''</TEXT></DOC>
