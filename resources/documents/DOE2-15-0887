In order to visualize the vascular structure, flowingblood must be labeled to achieve contrast against background static tissue.In this technique, a little surface coil is used as the labeling devicein addition to a whole-body NMR imager. To label the flowing blood, amagnetic field gradient is applied along the long axis of a living subject.The labeling coil over a carotid artery in the neck is fed RF at theresonant frequency of the protons under the coil. Arterial flow movesblood protons from a field below resonance (at the heart), steadily passingthrough resonance (at the neck) to a field high above resonance (in thehead); at the end of the event blood protons are inverted, or labeledby an adiabatic fast passage. Meanwhile, protons in stationary tissuefeel only a constant field and remain unaffected.</TEXT></DOC>
