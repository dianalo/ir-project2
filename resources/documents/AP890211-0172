Milken has moved to block the firm's record criminalfraud settlement on grounds it illegally denies him his job andmultimillion-dollar pay.   Attorneys for Milken on Friday asked U.S. District Judge KimbaWood to reject Drexel's $650 million settlement with the governmenton the grounds it violates his constitutional rights.   If successful, the motion could force prosecutors and defenseattorneys back into negotiations _ or possibly court _ after atwo-year investigation and settlement that allowed Drexel to avoid apotentially lengthy and embarrassing trial.   ``The prosecutor here is acting like a sheriff in the Wild West _solely on his own initiative and in his wholly unfettereddiscretion,'' said the motion filed with Wood.   Milken is one of the biggest targets of a federal crackdown onsecurities-law abuse and is expected to be indicted soon on fraudand racketeering charges stemming from his powerful position atDrexel, one of the nation's largest investment firms. The pressureon him has intensified since Drexel agreed to cooperate withprosecutors as part of its plea-bargain settlement.   Details of the agreement, made public two weeks ago, also requireDrexel to withhold at least half of the money due to Milken'sbrother, senior Drexel aide Lowell J. Milken, for 1988 and tosuspend him if indicted.   ``The prosecutor seeks...to achieve indirectly what he could notachieve directly _ to punish the Milkens through the imposition ofmultimillion-dollar fines and the deprivation of their livelihoodswithout indictment, hearing and trials,'' the 28-page motion bydefense attorneys said.   ``This action both denies them due process of law and constitutesan unconstitutional taking of property,'' it added.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Baird declined to comment on themotion, saying the government would respond in court papers.   Milken, who heads Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.-based high-yield``junk'' bond department, has been credited with pioneering the $175billion market for these debt securities, used to finance takeoversand the growth of small companies.   The motion said his 1988 pay would ``greatly exceed $100million,'' almost entirely through a yearly bonus tied to hisperformance.   Neither Milken has been charged with any criminal activity andboth have denied wrongdoing.   ``This is the government using Drexel to take money that Michaeland Lowell Milken have already earned without bringing a chargeagainst either of them,'' said Michael Armstrong, an attorney forLowell Milken.   The motion said the agreement violates their rights because itprecedes hearings on whether the Milkens committed any crime,whether their property can be legally seized or whether there is anylawful basis for suspending them.   In settling criminal charges with the government, Drexel agreedto plead guilty to six felony counts and pay $300 million in finesand civil penalties. Another $350 million would be placed in anaccount to settle potential civil claims.   The agreement, reached Dec. 21 after two years of investigationof the nation's fifth-largest securities firm, included allegationsof crooked deals with now-imprisoned speculator Ivan Boesky and thedefunct securities firm Princeton-Newport Partners.   The pact remains subject to approval by the Securities andExchange Commission and the court. Negotiations with the SECreportedly have stalled because of an SEC demand that Drexel moveits junk bond division to New York.   Once approved by the SEC, the agreement is to be sent to JudgeWood for final approval.   In a separate letter to the judge, Armstrong said the pleaagreement was improperly filed with the court and should not havebeen disclosed publicly until Drexel formally enters a guilty plea.   Details of the agreement were revealed after U.S. AttorneyRudolph Giuliani requested that the specific counts be unsealed.Giuliani, who left office the week after the charges were madepublic, made prosecuting Wall Street crimes a priority of hisfive-year tenure.   Drexel is one of the most profitable investment concerns in thecountry with 10,000 employees worldwide.</TEXT></DOC>
