Todaythe Senate is scheduled to vote on something that could do alot more to define the future political character of theUnited States. It's the old Hatch Act. President Bush hasalready vetoed a bill to repeal the act's prohibitions onpolitical activity by federal employees. The House overrodethe veto yesterday, by a whopping and revealing 327 to 93vote. The vote in the Senate today is expected to be closer.The outcome will tell the public much about whose intereststhe modern Congress represents these days.   The bill that Mr. Bush vetoed would let some three millionfederal and postal workers hold party offices and solicitmoney from co-workers for federal workers' PACs.</LP><TEXT>   This, of course, is taking place at the very moment thatCongress is in a budget summit with the White House to getcontrol of the Titanic $1.2 trillion federal budget. Thatbudget pays for what all these three million federal workersdo. Is Congress serious? Probably not very about controllingthe budget, but we suspect the Members, particularly theDemocrats, are quite serious about transforming publicworkers into voting constituents. Term limitations, anyone?   But there is also a philosophical relationship between theout-of-control federal budget and this effort to repeal theHatch Act. In political capitals around the world today --Moscow, Warsaw, Prague, Mexico City, London, Brasilia,Washington, Albany, Trenton -- the issue on the table is thepublic sector's claim on incomes. In every case there is atleast recognition now that the public commitment -- andusually what we're talking about here is the size of thepublic workforce -- is too large and too expensive. Publicbudgets everywhere are cracking under this weight.   What is by no means settled is whether the politicians whoare elected to represent private citizens have the will togain control over this public colossus. President Salinas ofMexico has shown extraordinary political courage to date intrying to wean his country off dependency on publicinstitutions and publicly subsidized jobs. But the House ofRepresentatives by its vote yesterday on Mr. Bush's Hatchveto makes plain what many voters suspect: It does not havethe will to control public-sector growth. Its Members'incumbency, which is to say their careers, is now dependenton the power that such a large legislative and bureaucraticstate confers.   Obviously there is a partisan interest in overturning theHatch Act. Public employees' unions have become the mostvibrant source of political support for Democraticpresidential candidates in the wake of the effort by theteachers' unions to help elect Jimmy Carter. Beneath thislies the continuing Democratic assumption that most problems-- the homeless, the environment, welfare dependency, failedschools, health costs -- will be righted merely with a largerpublic commitment, which is to say by hiring more publicworkers to lay their hands on the problems in perpetuity. TheDemocrats now want federal employees to be able to lobby formore of this.   The vote in the Senate today will reveal whether Congresswishes to send the U.S. further into this public-sector dreamworld or get on with the business of scaling back the stateand its unsupportable costs.</TEXT></DOC>
