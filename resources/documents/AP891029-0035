(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The quake that left at least 1,000people homeless here deepened the long-standing fissures in therelations between authorities and the majority Hispanic population,community activists said.   Hispanic leaders complain the city left them out of post-quakeplanning sessions, prompting them to file a complaint with the U.S.Attorney General's office last week.   ``We've had a long history of neglect and discrimination here inWatsonville,'' said Cruz Gomez, a local activist and City Councilcandidate. ``We historically have been left out of the politicalprocess and are accustomed to lots of promises and no action.''   Cruz confirmed the complaint was filed and that Department ofJustice mediators were meeting with Watsonville's Hispanic leaders.   Hispanic residents left homeless by the disaster charged thecity was unresponsive to their post-quake needs. Communityactivists said most of the 1,000 to 3,000 people left homeless inthe agricultural city of some 28,000 residents were low-incomeHispanics.   The city initially failed to dispatch Spanish-speaking rescueworkers to help Hispanics and didn't distribute literature inSpanish explaining relief programs, said Bernardo Arellano.   Arellano was left homeless in the Oct. 17 quake and has lived ina tent since then. ``I didn't even see anyone from the city untilabout a week later,'' he said.   ``We keep hearing about how everyone has been helped in SanFrancisco and how they are all right now. I'd like to think thatthe reason we're still outside isn't because of racialdiscrimination,'' he said. ``But I don't know what else to think.''   Arellano, 23, said he and other low-income Hispanics who toil inthe fields fear long-term housing needs will be ignored as well.   City officials adamantly denied charges of neglect anddiscrimination and said they've been doing everything they can tohelp everyone affected by the quake. People like Arellano are stillin tents because they have refused offers to live in enclosedshelters, like the large auditorium at the Santa Cruz CountyFairgrounds, they said.   ``Any distrust in the Hispanic community is being fermented bycertain people and organizations I'd rather not name,'' said CityManager John Radin. ``There are always a few bigots, but there hasnever been any real discrimination here in Watsonville that I'veseen.''   State Sen. Henry Mello, a Democrat born and raised inWatsonville, maintained the city ``doesn't have any more racialprejudice than anywhere else.''   Despite official disclaimers, complaints about institutionalracism and post-quake abandonment were expressed by diverse membersof the Hispanic community, particularly by the new residents ofCallaghan Park.   There, in the park at the entrance to the city, some 200low-income Hispanics have erected about 45 tents. The tent dwellersshower at the local YMCA or in the homes of friends. They cook onbarbeque grills or butane gas stoves.   The stand-off at the tent city is the result of a legacy ofneglect, Hispanic activists said.   ``There certainly has been a problem in the past on the part ofthe city in terms of responsiveness to the Latino community,'' saidJoaquin Avila, a Fremont attorney who represented Gomez and othersin a federal lawsuit that charged the city's voting systemdiscriminated against minority candidates and voters.   Watsonville's aggressive downtown redevelopment displaced adisproportionate number of Hispanic business owners, said Avila.The city has lagged behind in hiring workers and appointing boardand commission members who reflect the city's majority Hispanicpopulation, he said.   The 1980 U.S. Census showed 48 percent of the city's residentsas Hispanic. State officials and local activists estimate thatfigure is now closer to 55 to 60 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
