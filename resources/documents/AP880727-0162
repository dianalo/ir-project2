Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy said the suspensionwould remain in place until Qatar returns the missiles to theUnited States.   ``What we have done is to place on hold a number of agreementsthat were under consideration,'' Murphy told the House subcommitteeon Europe and the Middle East.   ``We consider it very much in the interests of developing thesolid relationship with Qatar that those missiles be returnedsoonest. And we've made that very clear,'' he added.   Murphy himself made an official protest when he visited theQatari capital of Doha last month.   Another official, speaking on condition he not be named, saidQatar had been seeking several military and economic agreementswith the United States, including the purchase of weapons. ``Wetold them everything is frozen,'' he added. ``Relations are nowcorrect but cool.''   The United States does not have any defense cooperation withQatar but considers the country important as a member of thepro-Western Gulf Cooperation Council which includes Saudi Arabiaand Kuwait.   U.S. officials wants to get the Stingers back in order to seetheir serial numbers and determine where Qatar got them. The UnitedStates first learned of the Stingers' presence in Qatar last March,when an embassy official saw one of the rockets in televisionfootage of a military parade.   U.S. officials say they do not know how many of theshoulder-fired rockets Qatar has. They have speculated that Qatarwas given the Stingers by Iran, which in turn captured them fromthe U.S.-supplied Afghan rebels fighting against the Sovietoccupation of their country.   Other officials say Qatar may have bought the missiles on theblack market, although that possibility is less likely.   Strict controls apply to the sale of the Stingers, which areconsidered of great value to terrorists because they are portableand highly accurate.   In response to questioning, Murphy said the United States wasnot considering recalling its ambassador to Qatar who heads a tinymission of five Americans.   Such a move would not be in the interests of maintainingrelations with the pro-Western oil state, Murphy said. Theambassador ``is the only one with access to decision makers''there, he added.   Qatar contends it needs the missiles for self-defense and hasrejected any attempts by U.S. officials to even see them.</TEXT></DOC>
