HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An economist delving into why Americans pay morethan Canadians for health care has discovered one important reason:U.S. doctors charge twice as much for doing less.   Despite their bigger fees, U.S. doctors earn only aboutone-third more than their Canadian counterparts, said the study.This is largely because they see fewer patients and have higheroverhead for such things as fancier offices.   Health care for Americans costs an average of $1,780 per year,while for Canadians it costs $1,286, according to the study byeconomist Victor R. Fuchs of Stanford University.   Overall, physician fees are 2.4 times higher in the UnitedStates, he said. Differences in hospital bills and other expensesalso contribute to the lower cost of medical care in Canada.   However, Canadian doctors do not save money by skimping onpatient care, Fuchs said. In fact, he found that they provide about25 percent more services to their patients.   Canada provides complete, fully paid health coverage for allcitizens. In the United States, one in seven people has no healthinsurance, and even those with coverage typically have to pay atleast part of the bill.   ``If physician fees in the United States were the same as inCanada, by how much would total health care expenditures bereduced?'' said Fuchs. ``If the fees were cut in half and loweredto the Canadian level, total expenditures would be reduced by about10 percent.''   His calculations, which converted Canadian figures into U.S.dollars, were based was based on 1985 data and published in today'sissue of the New England Journal of Medicine.   Among the findings:   -U.S. fees for surgery and other high-tech services, such asX-rays and anesthesia, were more than three times higher.   -On a per capita basis, Canada had more doctors but fewerspecialists.   -In 1985, net income for office-based doctors was $112,199 inthe United States and $73,607 in Canada.   -U.S. doctors are paid five times more than Canadians forvisiting patients in the hospital.   Canadian fees are uniform for each service within provinces andare set through negotiations between doctors and the government.   Fuchs said he doubts the Canadian system could be adopted in theUnited States.   ``There is reason to question whether the quality of our civilservices is up to the quality of the Canadian civil services,'' hesaid. ``There is also reason to question whether the organizationand degree of discipline in the profession is as strong as inCanada. We are very much individualists, and that includesphysicians.''</TEXT></DOC>
