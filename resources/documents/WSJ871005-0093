An extraordinary gain of 77 million dollars brought profit attributable to shareholders to 267 million dollars.    Jardine Strategic was formed in November 1986, so there aren't year-earlier comparison figures. Upon its creation, it was injected with substantial stakes in Jardine Matheson's real-estate, hotels and foods operations. In February, it merged with Jardine Securities Ltd. Last week, it reached an accord to buy 20% of Bear Stearns Cos. of the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
