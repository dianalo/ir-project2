The interaction of nuclear proteins with the promoter regionof the GM-CSF gene that is likely to be responsible for this patternof GM-CSF expression was investigated. The authors show that nuclearproteins interact with DNA fragments from the GM-CSF promoter in a cell-specificmanner. A region spanning two cytokine-specific sequences, cytokine 1(CK-1, 5', GAGATTCCAC 3') and cytokine 2 (CK-2, 5' TCAGGTA 3') boundtwo nuclear proteins from GM-CSF-expressing cells in gel retardationassays. NF-GMb was inducible with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate andaccompanied induction of GM-CSF message. NF-GMb was absent in cell linesnot producing GM-CSF, some of which had other distinct binding proteins.NF-GMa and NF-GMb eluted from a heparin-Sepharose column at 0.3 and 0.6M KCl, respectively. They hypothesize that the sequences CK-1 and CK-2bind specific proteins and regulate GM-CSF transcription.</TEXT></DOC>
