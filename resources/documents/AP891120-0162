Those changes are shaking assumptions and premises that havebeen the conventional wisdom of U.S. policies and politics.   Now, suddenly, nations that were part of the enemy camp havetheir own miniature New Deal programs of U.S. aid, complete withAmerican acronyms. The Support for Eastern European Democracy Act,SEED for short, will provide nearly $1 billion worth of aid overthree years, most of it for Poland, a small slice for Hungary.   The Pentagon already is at work on preemptive pruning of defensebudgets, knowing that unless it starts cutting, Congress is likelyto start slashing.   Political tenets that have stood for decades are going to bechanging. In national election campaigns, Republicans usually havebeen in command of the national security issue, Democrats oftendefensive about it. To dramatize his support for the military,Michael Dukakis rode around in a tank and wound up looking silly,in one of the memorable images of the 1988 campaign. Next time,that trip may not be deemed necessary.   The administration is concerned about wholesale cuts in defense,and about pressures for swift withdrawal of American forces fromwestern Europe. That's where the big defense money is, more than$150 billion a year, with some 305,000 U.S. troops stationed there.That posture was built around the danger of conventional attackfrom the East, a risk Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney says is nowvery unlikely.   The sudden change in the East makes that money an invitingtarget in the era of deficit woes, and not only for Democrats. Thepeace dividend could be the change that permits President Bush tostand permanently on his campaign promise against new taxes.   Nevertheless, the administration is firmly against rapid cuts inmanpower there, Vice President Dan Quayle saying that would beprecipitous and risky. Cheney said U.S. force reductions must benegotiated, not unilateral. Bush proposed a reduction to 275,000men on each side, and that is under negotiation now.   ``What you want to do first of all is build down to parity,''Cheney said in an NBC-TV interview, noting that the Soviet Unionstill has about 380,000 troops in East Germany, Berlin Wall or nowall.   Those warnings may be difficult to enforce in a government besetby budget deficits.   ``Ultimately, if you're going to save money in the defensebudget, you're talking about a reduction in the combat forcescommitted to Europe,'' Cheney said. ``It may be possible, longterm, for us to do that.''   Short-term, the pressure are building, with suggestions thatboth sides cut back quickly.   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said the United States and NATO should bethinking about a response should the Soviet Union offer to removeall foreign troops from European nations within a few years.   Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said anysuch proposition should be handled with care. He said theadministration ought to be ready because Soviet President MikhailS. Gorbachev might produce that kind of dramatic peace move at theseaborne summit Dec. 2 and 3.   Donald Atwood, the deputy secretary of defense, said westernnations should work for economic well-being in the Warsaw Pactnations lest instability jeopardize the movement toward freedom inthe old Soviet bloc.   But Atwood's message also came with a caution signal: ``Now isnot the time for unilateral disarmament. Now is not the time for usto talk about a lessening of the impact of NATO.''   When Bush went to the NATO summit six months ago with his callfor negotiated cuts in conventional arms, the modernization ofshort-range nuclear missiles in West Germany was a companion issue.That was shelved until 1992, a concession to the Bonn government,which faced widespread domestic opposition to the new nuclearweapons.   There is no prospect now that those aging U.S. weapons will beupgraded, and the administration knows it, although no one issaying so openly.   At the same time, Cheney argues that the changing situation putsan even greater premium on strategic weapons. He said the SovietUnion is modernizing its arsenal. ``They are not giving up,'' hesaid in the TV interview. ``Indeed, they are improving theirstrategic nuclear capability.''   Countering that in a shrinking defense budget is going to beincreasingly difficult. And there is concern in the administrationthat Congress may try to deal with the new situation with oldhabits _ by insisting that the reductions spare its politicalfavorites. Cutting the budget will mean shutting down bases, andnot just in West Germany. It also is going to cost defensecontracts, which means business and jobs.   The changes are not going to be politically painless.   ``Unlike the old comic strip character Pogo, we are notconfronted with insurmountable opportunities,'' Sen. Carl M. Levin,D-Mich., said the other day. ``We are confronted by great westernvalue-affirming opportunity.''   It does carry a price.   _   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Walter R.
