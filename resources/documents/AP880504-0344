In charges filed Tuesday in federal court in Minneapolis, theSEC also accuses the Coon Rapids-based biotechnology company offiling false reports with the government and covering up that thecompany's founders, Micheal and Eugene Gruenberg, were secretlyfinancing the sale of its instruments to foreign customers.   In a simultaneous filing, Endotronics, while neither admittingnor denying the charges, agreed to a permanent injunction barringit from such actions in the future, the SEC said.   ``We merely have agreed to manage the business professionallyand in accordance with SEC rules and the law,'' Monis Schuster,general counsel for Endotronics, said Wednesday. ``We have cleanhands,'' she said, adding that the allegations stem from thecompany's previous management.   The injunction, if approved by U.S. District Judge PaulMagnuson, would close the book on the SEC's investigation ofEndotronics, said Mary Keefe, chief of enforcement in the SEC'sChicago office, which conducted the investigation.   She said the Justice Department must decide if criminal chargeswill be filed.   Richard Sakowicz, Endotronics' current president, said Wednesdaythe SEC filing, called a consent decree, does not call for any fineagainst the company. It is significant because it marks the end ofthe SEC and FBI investigation, which current management hascooperated with, Sakowicz said.   The SEC and the FBI have been investigating Endotronics, whichmakes machines for use in genetic engineering, for more than a year.   The company filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11of the bankruptcy code last year after the investigations weredisclosed. The disclosure came during a highly publicized effort bythe company to get the 1987 Legislature to free $24 million intaconite production tax funds for economic development on the IronRange. The company said it wanted the money for research which itsaid could lead to a plant in Hibbing.   Endotronics has since emerged from bankruptcy under newmanagement.   The SEC, in its first formal charges against Endotronics,alleges that founders Micheal and Eugene Gruenberg supplied atleast $5.9 million of their own money to pay for machines thatsupposedly had been sold to customers.   The Gruenbergs and other company officials have been sued by agroup of shareholders who allege the officials faked sales toinflate the company's stock price and defraud investors.Endotronics stock peaked at $35.50 in August 1986, before fallingto less than $1 last year.   The stock closed at $1.62{ Wednesday on the over-the-countermarket, down 25 cents a share.   The SEC said at least $3.4 million of the company's sales inJapan were false, because the customers had no firm obligation topay for them.   Eugene Gruenberg, former chairman and cofounder of Endotronics,declined to comment. He and his son, Micheal, former president ofthe company, resigned last year.</TEXT></DOC>
