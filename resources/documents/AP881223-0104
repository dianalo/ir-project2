An editorial in the Vatican's newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano,said the church feels determined ``as never before'' to safeguardthe common good against ``technological manipulation of the veryfonts of life.''   ``The oscillations and discord in the Catholic camp havecontributed to rendering the question more complex,'' said theeditorial.   ``Above all, the gravity of the decision of several Catholicuniversity clinics to continue, under certain conditions, thepractive of homologous `in vitro' fertilizaton, cannot beundervalued.''   ``Such resolve, from the moment it was made public, has become achallenge as well,'' the newspaper said.   In January, a Vatican meeting failed to resolve a dispute betweenthe Vatican and three Catholic universities in Europe on researchingtest-tube conception.   In 1987, a Vatican document approved by Pope John II hadcondemned test-tube conception, surrogate motherhood andexperimentation on live embryos.   It also branded as immoral the freezing of embryos, cloning,attempts to fashion animal-human hybrids and the implanation ofembryos in artificial or animal uteruses.   Shortly after the document's publication, the Catholic Universityof Lille, France, announced it will continue experiments with``in-vitro'' fertilization to help couples who otherwise couldn'thave children.   The January meeting was with rectors of the Lille institution,Universite Catholique de Louvain, in Belgium, and Holland'sKatholieke Universiteit of Nijmegen.   Roman Catholic teaching holds that the only moral way to createhuman life is normal sexual acts between a married couple. In ``invitro'' methods, an egg is taken from a woman's ovary and unitedwith sperm outside the womb. When life begins to grow, thefertilized egg is then implanted in a womb.   Referring to the universities' decision, the editorial continued:``The directors of this ... very serious rebellion, try still tojustify themselves by claiming to respect the Roman teaching.''   The editorial said the clinics claim not to understand thereasons for the stance of the Vatican's Congregation for theDoctrine of the Faith.   The congregation is the Vatican's watchdog for doctrinalorthodoxy.   The newspaper asserted that use of artificial birth control endedup being an incentive for abortion, and that similarly ``it isbecoming evident that artifical procreation puts as its operatingpremise'' discriminating cultural choices as to what kind of babieswould be born.</TEXT></DOC>
