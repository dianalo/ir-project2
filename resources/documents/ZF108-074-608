(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>DOCUMENTING PAYBACK FOR A DISTRIBUTED PUBLISHING STRATEGYandM;For the past few years, companies have been taking mincing steps towardelectronic publishing.andP;  Departmental Macintosh computers or RISC workstationshave been hauled in on a piecemeal basis to stem increasingly outlandishproduction costs for manuals, documents and other paper-based products thatinevitably accompany any business.andM;For many of these same companies, it now makes financial sense to spread thegospel of electronic publishing throughout the organization.andP;  If implementedcorrectly, such a strategy can cut production costs in half.andP;  At the sametime, electronic publishing can help manage the forklift-high piles of paperthat can overwhelm even the most accomplished paper shuffler.andM;Even more important is the potential of corporate electronic publishing as astrategic weapon, particularly for the service operations of a company.andP;  AnMIS manager who builds a corporate electronic publishing system gives everyarm of his company ready access to the latest information.andP;  This can prove avaluable asset to any company with multiple divisions that span a largeportfolio of products.andM;But most of the technologies that constitute electronic publishing are stillrelatively immature.andP;  While the potential return on investment is high, thereare also many opportunities for failure.andP;  A poor strategy--or a lack ofone--can inflate the company's budget, deflate employee productivity, leavethe corporation with systems that are doomed to rapid extinction andseriously impair a product's time to market.andM;As a simple example of the cost savings that electronic publishing cancreate, examine the cost of manually producing a camera-ready page ofdocumentation.andP;  Producing a page can cost--depending on complexity--$62 to$2,500, with typical text-only documents at the low end and manual pages thatcombine text with graphics at the other.andP;  By adding an electronic publishingsystem that provides file sharing and some in-house production, a proposalsgroup that products just 500 pages of text-only camera-ready documents at $62per page can cut that cost to $44.20 per page.andP;  The total cost declines from$31,000 to $22,100 for a savings of almost $9,000.andP;  (See &quot;How ConventionalDesktop Publishing Compares to Corporate Solution,&quot; below.)andM;The engineering department of the same company can reduce the cost ofproducing complex technical documents from $300 per camera-ready page to$210, yielding a cost reduction from $150,000 to $105,000 for 500 of thesepages.andM;A corporate strategy could link two groups, allowing each to incorporate andreuse materials developed by the other.andP;  The added savings can amount to 10percent of the corporate publishing budget, and the system will pay foritself in 16 to 24 months.andM;Although establishing a far-reaching corporate publishing strategy is thelogical next step for an organization that has already automated part of itspublishing process, it is the step on which many companies stumble.andP;  In thesedays of departmental computing, the different IS paths that are pursued bydifferent parts of a company, as well as the disparate user interfaces thatabound, have kept departments largely isolated from each other.andM;For the corporate electronic publishing strategy of the '90s, MIS directorsshould tap in-house computer resources to develop the technological andorganizational support that is necessary for a heterogeneous distributedpublishing system.andM;The term &quot;Fourth Wave,&quot; coined by Seybold Publications, a publishing andconsulting company located in Media, Pa., refers to publishing's shift fromproprietary integrated systems to solutions that are part of the computermainstream.andM;Seybold says that this shift will mean a completely different approach topublishing.andP;  A Fourth Wave system will likely include MS-DOS, OS/2 and Unixoperating systems, and architectures such as IBM's SAA, DEC's NAS, Sun's NFSand X windows.andP;  Standard hardware and software, off-the-shelf solutions andintegration through standards will make it easier to build a system that canbe kept current over time.andM;These separate pieces already exist; developing a corporate publishingstrategy is therefore an action that any corporation can afford to beginimplementing at its own pace.andM;The benefits of a corporate publishing strategy for the MIS manager includean electronic backbone for file sharing and data reusability across theentire corporation.andP;  For the company's chief financial officer, thistranslates into a more unified corporation, better time to market and anaverage productivity increase of 4:1.andM;But there are more benefits to distributed publishing than increasedproductivity from sharing and reusing data.andP;  Staff reductions orredeployments can yield additional savings.andP;  And the ability to do morein-house--with a smaller staff--can reduce exponentially the cost of vendingwork to service bureaus.andM;A well-organized strategy provides greater project control from inceptionthrough production.andP;  Deadlines become more flexible, and last-minute changesbecome less complicated and less expensive.andM;One way a distributed strategy ensures control is through corporate-approvedpublishing templates.andP;  By using templates, corporations can create andenforce publishing standards, a foundation for improved quality and acoordinated look across a company's publications.andM;Organizations that produce a large body of printed materials have reporteddramatic results from their corporate publishing strategies.andM;For example, before distributed publishing was implemented for production ofthe House and Senate Journals, writers for the North Carolina GeneralAssembly sent word-processed text supplemented with hand-drawn graphics tooutside typesetters who had to re-input the information.andP;  Proofs for reviewand revision were sent back to the client and returned to the typesetter tobe re-input yet again.andP;  Turnaround time was often eight weeks or more.andM;The General Assembly's distributed publishing system consists of InterleafWorkstation Publishing Software, running on a VAXstation II networked acrosstwo buildings to clustered VAXes that link more than 200 PCs andworkstations.andP;  Writers collect data from the network, format it usingInterleaf and produce camera-ready pages in one day instead of eight weeks.andO;The savings on typesetting alone total $40,000.andM;The rationale for adopting or expanding a companywide publishing solution hasbeen well-documented (no pun intended).andP;  According to Interconsult, a marketresearch and publishing strategy company in Arlington, Mass., the averagecorporation spends 6 percent to 10 percent of its revenues on publishing.andO;For example, a $6 billion company can easily spend $360 million.andM;Sheer volume can be the deciding factor in developing a corporate publishingstrategy.andP;  A company producing one eight-page newsletter each week will spendabout $200 an issue for pre-press work.andP;  Such low volume hardly justifies thepurchase of a $65,000 image setter.andP;  But a corporation churning out 12 pagesper day would do well to make such an investment.andM;There are other sound reasons for developing a companywide publishingstrategy.andP;  Documents can be stored easily on disk, freeing up what couldamount to entire warehouses of hard copy.andP;  This ameliorates instances where,for example, the documentation for the Boeing 747 is too large to fit insidethe plane.andM;Because realizing an ROI between 16 and 24 months is not uncommon for simpledesktop publishing solutions, these systems are eminently cost-justifiable.andO;Distributed solutions promise similar returns, but that by no means indicatesMISmanagers should get rid of the existing systems.andP;  The best course ofaction is to implement a publishing system that integrates existingpublishing systems with the company's mainstream system to create a cleargrowth path.andM;GET BACK, MACandM;Many users already have Macintosh- and PC-based desktop solutions.andP;  Withcomplete hardware and software packages ranging in price from $2,000 to$12,000, these systems enjoy a popularity that is not likely to diminishsoon.andP;  But microcomputer-based publishing systems are not the only choice formany environments.andM;Distributed solutions for desktop publishing, based on multivendor platformsthat include workstations and minicomputers, offer the best growth path--intheory.andP;  But right now, multivendor distributed desktop publishing systemspresent the same problems as distributed anything--the technology is just notall there yet.andM;Workstations are becoming more powerful and less expensive.andP;  In a few yearsthey could make it easier to share text and graphics between departments.andO;There are some who say that workstation affordability will make itcost-justifiable to replace the Macs, but such a strategy will becomecost-effective only when more capable software becomes available.andM;One major drawback to today's workstations is cost.andP;  Although X windowsterminals cost less than $3,000 for monochrome and as little as $5,000 forcolor, prices for workstation publishing sytems begin at $15,000 for astand-alone workstation with all necessary hardware and software.andO;Departmental systems, for example a network of 15 workstations linked to aVAX or an IBM AS/400, can run about $300,000 including software andperipherals--about $20,000 per seat.andP;  Mac or PC users can get started foranywhere from $2,000 to $12,000.andM;But it's important to look beyond platforms and software.andM;In the long run, a sound distributed publishing strategy will position acompany to compete in the not-too-distant future, when electronic mediumsbecome the required format for submitting bids, proposals and documentation.andM;The Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support (CALS) standard signalsthis trend.andP;  Established and now required by the Department of Defense (DoD),CALS' purpose is to manage the huge amount of text, graphical and imageinformation more effectively between companies involved in the developmentand acquisition of weapons and the DoD.andP;  The program is in the first of itstwo phases.andM;The goal of Phase I is essentially a macro version of the distributedpublishing solution suggested here--to decrease the paper flow betweenislands of desktop publishing.andP;  CALS Phase I will reach this goal byrequiring contractors and subcontractors to convert to electronic deliverybased on MIL-STD-1840A.andP;  However, because specifications are still beingdeveloped, full compliance with CALS is impossible now.andM;Phase II highlights the idea of paperless technical manuals.andP;  The goal ofPhase II is to create the integrated Weapons Systems Database, a tremendouson-line database accessible by industry and government.andM;CALS is an indication of what's down the line for many other industries.andP;  TheFood and Drug Administration, for example, is moving toward adoption ofelectronic delivery standards for new drug applications.andM;Creating and publishing this data electronically could cut one to two yearsfrom teh drug approval cycle.andP;  This means companies with strong distributedpublishing systems will have a competitive advantage in securing firstapproval of new drugs, achieving faster time to market and, therefore, biggerprofits.andM;CALS also points to the need for text and graphics file transfercompatibility, a pivotal component of any corporate publishing strategy.andO;These still-developing interchange standards are critical to the future ofdesktop publishing.andP;  Multiple sources and systems must share thisinformation, and a viable growth path must be assured.andM;The International Standards Organization (ISO) has begun developing a set ofstandards that users want but vendors are having a difficult time providing.andM;Although the industry is moving to establish standards for text and graphicsinterchange, the best bet now is expand into a system consistent with thedirection of the ISO's efforts--international interchange standards such asthe Office Document Architecture/Office Document Interchange Format(ODA/ODIF) and the Standardized Graphics Markup Language (SGML).andP;  Thesestandards eventually will provide a standard interchange format for both textand graphics, but as with CALS, there are still some holes.andP;  For example,ODA/ODIF and SGML cannot handle scientific equations and tables yet.andM;While the standards are under development, users can turn to vendor-suppliedsolutions.andP;  DEC's Compound Document Architecture (CDA), for example, followsthe emerging ODA/ODIF standards.andP;  With CDA, users can interchange documentsconsisting of text and graphics across multiple platforms and operatingsystems--including VAX/VMS, VAX/Ultirx.andP;  MS-DOS, OS/2 and Macintosh--on aDECnet network.andM;After a system manager has determined what the most appropriate architectureis, the task of acquiring the necessary elements of an in-house publishingfacility continues.andM;Beginning with the basics, a workstation publishing package is likely to costbetween $1,500 and $15,000; microcomputer-based systems, on the other hand,are a few hundred dollars at most.andP;  And the best word processor for a givenapplication is not necessarily the most expensive.andP;  A state or localgovernment agency, for example, is not likely to include many scientificformulas in its documents, and therefore shouldn't pay for that capability.andM;Distributing these packages on individual workstations rather than runningthem on a mainframe uses far fewer system resources.andP;  Because of the highercost of CPU cycles and software for time-sharing systems, it can cost almosttwice as much to produce formatted text on a mainframe as on microcomputers.andM;But once an organization decides to bring in workstations for publishing,system managers can expect to run into at least one hidden cost in the areaof software.andP;  Formatted text that's produced on a mainframe will typicallyhave to be run through a text translation package before it can be used in adesktop publishing system.andM;And that process is neither easy nor fast.andP;  Most mainframes usereserved-character sequences, such as a string beginning with a backslash ora period, within the text-only document to instruct the typesetting programhow to format the text.andP;  On the other hand, desktop publishing systems usenon-printing codes for their formatting instructions.andP;  Accordingly, documentsmigrated from mainframes to desktop systems must have theirreserved-character sequences either stripped out or converted to non-printingcodes to avoid being printed as part of the text.andM;The other direction, from desktop publishing systems to mainframes runningformatting programs, requires the reverse.andP;  The WYSIWYG system of formattingmust be changed to the reserved-sequence system used by mainframe programs.andO;Such translation is rarely automatic and never fool-proof.andP;  It may be betterto enter the reserved sequences on the desktop system and never use theformatting capabilities available in most desktop word processors.andM;These text-processing system interfaces and translators can be expensive, butbecause it is currently impractical to standardize on a single systemthroughout the entire corporation, translating programs are generally thebest option.andP;  They can save one-fourth to one-third of the time needed toreenter the data.andP;  This is especially true it the text is formatted--often amore time-consuming and more difficult task than simply typing the words.andM;Another method that involves more manual steps to transfer text into aminicomputer or microcomputer uses high-resolution scanners and software foroptical character recognition.andP;  Although faster than pure manual entry, evenblack-and-white scanners are not cheap.andP;  And in many cases the scanner is nota wise investment.andP;  For instance, sending an item to a service bureau forhalf-tones and stripping could run about $18.andP;  A low-end scanner yielding aresolution of 600 dots per inch (dpi) can run from $5,000 to $15,000--andsomeone has to be paid to run it.andM;But if a company's needs cost-justify purchase of a black-and-white scanner,the time savings can be considerable--it takes just two minutes to scananimage.andM;When considering color scanners, quality is an important factor.andO;Higher-quality scanners producing 1,000 to 2,400 dpi are priced between$50,000 and $100,000.andP;  Image scanning can take a good 40 minutes.andP;  But forthose who consider high quality a priority, it is better to send work to aservice bureau.andM;That's because with a scanner, color quality and the competency of theoperator are highly variable.andP;  Although an image scanned in-house may costnothing for a modest, 3-inch-by-5-inch piece of artwork, spending $100 forprofessionally produced color work by a service bureau can be wise.andM;And don't forget the cost of image-processing software, which can range from$600 to $15,000.andP;  Fortunately, because a designer can do in minutes what usedto take hours or days, the savings of time and money can be in the range of100 percent.andM;MIS managers should also note that art and illustrations can come from anumber of sources other than photographs or scanned images.andP;  Clipart--pictures and designs foud in large books and &quot;clipped&quot; and pasted onto apage layout--are now available on disk or CD-ROM, with prices ranging from$49 to $10,000.andP;  The minutes, as opposed to hours, needed to produce an imagecan produce ROI in months, weeks or even hours.andM;In many cases, it is no faster for a designer or artist to create anelectronic image than to create the same image manually.andP;  But an electronicimage is remarkably simpler to modify than manually produced artwork.andP;  Piechart values, colors and size can be changed with a couple of commands.andP;  Itis this time saved in revision and modifications that makes imaging softwarepay for itself.andM;Another area of potential savings is typography.andP;  With the software nowavailable, most companies can manage their own typography, and usually forconsiderably less than it costs to send the work outside.andM;For other, more sophisticated capabilities such as leading (spacing betweenlines), kerning (spacing between the letters in a word), stretching, slantingand rotating fonts, more specialized software must be used.andM;The price of these typography packages varies with the number of fontsincluded.andP;  Typical costs are about $49 per typeface, or $15,000 for a fullsystem.andM;Screen fonts and printer fonts should be representative of one another.andO;PostScript, which is the de facto standard among page description languages,offers a compatibility interface between basic hardware and peripheralssuppliers and must be considered when building a system poised forflexibility and growth.andM;The alliance between Apple and Microsoft--for better or worse--hopes somedayto challenge PostScript with an alternative.andM;Another element of the typical in-house publishing facility is the pagelayout package.andM;Some page layout packages are geared to handle structured, longer documentsfor technical publishing and can perform tasks such as footnoting andrepagination.andP;  Many offerings can generally meet users' requirements forproducing newsletters and brochures, and can thus support a corporatepublishing strategy.andP;  Prices for these packages range from $500 to $600.andM;After the page layout process comes the pre-press process.andP;  Althoughpre-press software is still relatively new, many steps in the process can beaccomplished electronically.andP;  Some packages can, for instance, separateimages into the four process colors used in printing.andP;  Others allow spotseparation, color correction and more.andM;It is also important to consider device-independent intermediate file formatsthat allow users to output to either a laser printer or an image setter fromthe same system.andP;  This is made possible by the use of a page descriptionlanguage (PDL).andP;  PDLs translate desktop publishing files into formattingspecifications that each printer can understand.andP;  Again, Adobe Systems'PostScript is the de facto standard in this area.andM;Most laser printers, which can range in price from $995 to $7,000, produce300 dpi, a sufficient resolution for many business applications and forproofing high-quality materials in publishing companies.andM;Color printers using inkjet or thermal technology are usually used for officepresentations and color proofs.andP;  Color printer prices are generally high, butthey are coming down as the technology progresses.andP;  Most desktop colorprinters have 300-dpi resolution.andP;  These printers range in price from $10,000to $50,000.andM;A needs assessment must address driver compatibility and determine whatquality output is needed for both proofing and final output.andP;  Usually a300-dpi printer is sufficient for proofing, although for the final output,higher resolution may be required.andP;  In that case, the organization willlikely have to turn to image-setting machines capable of resolutions of 1,000to 2,500 dpi, or even higher.andP;  These are the most expensive pieces of desktoppublishing hardware and, as a result, are purchased mostly by professionalpublishing companies or corporations whose large output justifies theexpenditure of between $65,000 and $125,000.andM;Whereas the printer or image setter is a critical piece of corporatepublishing strategy, one piece of hardware that will affect both system costand usage is the display.andP;  Monochrome displays are the least costly and areadequate for general projects like reports and proposals.andM;Applications that involve either photographs or high-resolution scannedimages require gray-scale displays capable of producing as many as 256 shadesof gray on screen.andP;  These are generally used for more sophisticated reportsand proposals, as well as for simple newsletters and documentation.andP;  Costsfor both monochrome and gray-scale displays range from $300 to $2,500.andM;Many applications require color displays.andP;  Eight-bit color display systems,which carry price tags of about $800, can handle as many as 256 colors andare generally used for producing basic marketing and training materials.andO;Also available are 32-bit color systems, generally used forprofessional-quality publishing or video.andP;  They can show millions of colorsand can replicate almost every detail of an original image.andP;  The cost rangesbetween $2,000 and $3,000 for a video board and $4,500 for a monitor.andM;Regardless of the individual components of a publishing system, a cost factorthat is often overlooked is user training.andM;Users must be trained, even on simple PC- or Mac-based systems.andP;  Typically,this training costs approximately $1,000 to $1,500 per employee for two tofive days of training, plus costs for lost productivity.andM;The overall effort to introduce or upgrade a corporate electronic publishingstrategy using an integrated electronic backbone will not be easy, fast orcheap.andP;  The investment not made, however, will in the long run impede acompany's ability to compete successfully.andM;Perhaps the most striking change to an organization will be that onedepartment will no longer have total dominion over the specific documents itproduces.andP;  To accommodate this sharing of information, a company would bewell-advised to set up a group to define and control the publishing processas part of a long-term strategy that is consistent with the company's overallgoals.andM;Mac Publishing Leads at VAX SitesandM;The Macintosh, with its ability to produce quality graphics at a reasonablecost, is the top publishing system platform at VAX sites, according to thelatest DR survey, but respondents also indicated a concern with publishingsystem performance and growth path.andM;The survey is based on questions asked of 100 VAX sites selected randomlyfrom a list provided by Computer Intelligence, a market research company inLa Jolla, Calif., and compiled by Beta Research of Syossett, N.Y.andO;Respondents had a median of 27-1/4 months' experience with computerpublishing systems, and a mean of 27 months.andM;Respondents were almost evenly divided among several industry segments, withthe largest group from the academic world.andM;More than 38 percent of the respondents indicated their publishing system wasnot on a local area network, and 61 percent said they used a single,all-inclusive system that took them from creation to production.andM;The issue of standards is still widely misunderstood among users, with morethan 35 percent of the survey respondents indicating they didn't know iftheir system was in compliance with graphical standards.andM;The top benefit of their present publishing systems, according to therespondents, was the ability to publish top-quality work while reducingproduction and controlling costs.andP;  The ability to change documents easily andat the last moment scored high, as did file-sharing features and data access.andM;The major concern was the need for improved performance.andP;  There is also roomfor improvement with the user interface, respondents said.andP;  Cost issues,reliability and training expenses also scored relatively high as concerns.andO;Issues such as data integration, data file storage and interoperability werelesser concerns.andM;Respondents were asked what the next additions to their publishing systemwould be.andP;  More than 55 percent said they planned to purchase a laserprinter, 38 percent indicated a PC and 35 percent said they planned to buy aMacintosh, Interestingly, 28 percent said their next purchase would be aworkstation.andP;  Color printers also scored high, at 23 percent.andM;No specific software system vendor garnered a large share of support in thesurvey; in fact, the largest segment was less than 20 percent.andP;  At 35 percenteach, the public relations and finance/administration departments were themost frequent users of publishing systems among companies responding to thesurvey.andP;  Marketing was second, at 34 percent.andM;Special reports, documentation and proposals all scored above 70 percent asthe primary use of the system.andP;  Brochures followed at 58 percent.andM;Newspaper Saves by Moving In-HouseandM;The International Banana Merchants Gazette is the apocryphal weekly journalof record for the tropical fruit distribution industry.andP;  This tabloid has hada long and honorable history since its founding in 1914 by publisher WilliamRandolf hurtz.andM;However, the IBM Gazette, as it is known in the fruit trade, has not kep upwith the technology of printing those news pages.andM;Stories for the 60-page IBM Gazette are first written and edited on aMicroVAX 3400 system.andP;  The art and technical schematics on such topics asfruit refrigeration are drawn by hand.andP;  Page layouts are then sketched ongrids and sent to a typesetting company along with the text, which istransmitted electronically.andP;  Meanwhile, graphics and photographs are sent toa film house.andM;This process has become very expensive.andP;  Typesetting alone now costs the IBMGazette $70 per page.andP;  In addition, the manual separating and stripping ofhand-drawn graphics costs $320 per page.andP;  The Gazette's MIS directorrecognizes the possibility of significant savings as well as the strategicbusiness opportunity in bringing most of this processing in-house.andM;His plan is to bring all typesetting in-house within six months.andP;  This willsave $105,000 on 25 issues (a half-year's publishing schedule).andP;  In addition,the MIS director estimates that generating and separating all graphics on aMacintosh will reduce costs at the film house to $260 per page in the secondhalf of the first year.andP;  This will produce an additional savings of $90,000.andM;Furthermore, he estimates, that in the second year, film preparation cots perpage will drop to $175.andP;  After the second year, any further gains areexpected to be m arginal and tied to an estimated 5 percent inflation rate.andM;As part of his plan, the MIS director proposes that 15 Mac II systems bebought.andP;  All Macs would be networked to the VAX, which would act as a fileserver running Mac-to-VAX connectivity software.andM;The MIS director budgets $125,000 for acquiring the Macs and $7,000 for theMac-to-VAX connectivity package.andP;  In addition, he budgets $23,000 for Macsoftware that includes packages for page layout and illustration.andO;Futhermore, he sets aside an annual sum of $5,000 for additional Mac softwaresuch as new type fonts.andP;  These and other software costs total $50,000.andM;For peripherals the MIS director budgets $63,000 for an electronictypesetter, $35,000 for tabloid-size color and laser printers, $19,000 for afilm processor and $3,000 for a monochrome scanner.andP;  Maintenance for allhardware and software, along with supplies, is expected to consume $40,000annually.andM;In addition, he estimates that three more people will need to be added to thestaff.andP;  Since copy editors will be taking on addtional responsibilitiespreviously handled by the typesetting service company, the MIS directorestimates that two additional copy editors will be needed at an estimatedcost of $90,000 which includes both salaries and overhead for benefits.andO;Furthermore, a production technician will be needed to operate the filmprocessor at an annual cost of $30,000 including benefits.andM;Using the corporate guideline of 11 percent, the MIS director estimates thenet present value of this project to be a prodigious $866,322, with aninternal rate of return of 78.6 percent.andP;  Just as impressive is the news thatfull payback will come in only 20 months.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
