Alfonse M. D'Amato's hometown on LongIsland will return $1 million in Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment funds that were earmarked to build a swimming pool, TheNew York Times reported.   Island Park officials requested earlier this week that theirapplication for the pool be withdrawn, citing local opposition tothe project and rising costs, the Times reported in its Saturdayeditions.   The officials denied that the cancellation was spurred by afederal inquiry into HUD-sponsored projects on Long Island,including in Island Park, the Times said.   Island Park was awarded the $1 million in grants for the poollast year after D'Amato, a village resident, personally lobbiedthen-HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce, the Times said.   The money for the pool came from Pierce's discretionary fund. Ina letter to village residents last fall, DAmato praised Pierce's``wise decision to approve this grant,'' the Times reported.   The pool was to have been built near a beach.   An assistant to HUD secretary Jack Kemp said Kemp was pleased thepool project was dead.   ``We think the funds can be used for a purpose that will be morein line with assisting low-income individuals,'' Mary Brunette, theassistant, told the Times.   The Times said it got no answer to telephone calls made toD'Amato's office Friday afternoon.   In Island Park, investigators are looking into allegations thatHUD-sponsored houses went to politically connected residents insteadof to minorities, as had been planned.</TEXT></DOC>
