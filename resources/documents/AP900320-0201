The Commerce Department said the January deficit was 20.5percent larger than December's $7.7 billion imbalance. Most of thedeterioration came from a 44 percent surge in oil shipments.   The January deficit was an ominous beginning for the new decade.Many analysts believe America's trade woes will worsen in comingyears as U.S. dependence on foreign oil grows.   For January, exports climbed to an all-time high of $32.1billion, 4 percent above the December level.   However, this gain was swamped by a 7.3 percent surge inimports, which increased to $41.3 billion.   The trade deficit, the difference between imports and exports,was the largest since a $10.1 billion imbalance in November.   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidthe January increase showed export growth has been outpacing growthin imports.   ``These numbers are pretty much as expected due to the deficitdrop in December, which was the lowest in five years. Everyoneseemed to realize they couldn't maintain that low level, and so itwas expected that there would be an increase in January,''Fitzwater said.   The U.S. trade deficit has been improving for the past twoyears, falling to $109 billion last year, down 8 percent from 1988.   But many economists predicted the 1990 deficit could beginrising again because of the oil bill and gains in the value of thedollar. A stronger U.S. currency makes imports cheaper forAmericans and U.S. products less competitive on overseas markets.   The huge 44 percent surge in oil imports did not come as asurprise, with analysts blaming the rise on December's record coldweather, which caused oil companies to import heavily in January torestock depleted supplies.   The total volume of oil, 291,278 barrels, was an all-time high,topping a previous record set in August.   Prices shot up to $20.13 per barrel, pushing the total oil billto $5.86 billion, the highest total dollar amount snce August 1982,a month when the volume was less but the price per barrel washigher.   The American Petroleum Institute has reported that foreign oilaccounted for a record 54 percent of consumption in January asdomestic production fell to its lowest level in a quarter century.   Another factor swelling the deficit in January was a 31 percentsurge in imports of clothing, which totaled $3.1 billion in January.   As usual, the deficit with Japan was the largest of any country.However, at $2.9 billion, it was at the lowest level since December1984.   The Bush administration has been pressing the Japanese to domore to purchase U.S. exports as a way of reducing the huge annualdeficit of $49 billion that America is running with Japan.   Other big deficits included Taiwan, $1.2 billion; China, $800million; Canada, $600 million, and the countries of Western Europe,$300 million.   Many economists are worried that the deficit will worsen evenfurther in coming months.   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting company, said hewas looking for the deficit for all of 1990 to total between $120billion and $125 billion, which would make it the second worstimbalance on history. The all-time high was a $152.1 billiondeficit in 1987.   ``Without a weaker dollar, we are just not going to get animprovement in trade,'' Evans said. ``We are destined to have badtrade numbers for some time.''   Such a forecast could spell trouble for the Bush administration,which is counting on further gains in exports to help boost thefortunes of American manufacturers and dampen protectionistsentiments in Congress.   Last month, President Bush held a hastily arranged meeting inCalifornia with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu to pressdemands that Japan do more to reduce its trade gap with the UnitedStates, which amounted to $49 billion last year.   Kaifu promised to make reduction of trade tensions a toppriority, but U.S. critics question whether the verbal commitmentswill be turned into significant market-opening moves.   Sen. John Danforth of Missouri, the ranking Republican on theSenate trade subcommittee, said Monday that Japanese officials hemet with in Tokyo last week appeared to be more willing to addressU.S. complaints about their closed markets.   ``There was a recognition that the time had come to redress thegrievances we had,'' said Danforth, who has been a leading criticof both Japanese trade practices and the way Bush and formerPresident Reagan addressed them.   But Danforth told reporters, ``I remain skeptical that the ...talks are going to lead to the kind of concrete results we hopefor.''   He said the talks will have to produce more specific sales ofU.S. products to Japan as well as a broader general commitment byTokyo to removing impediments.</TEXT></DOC>
