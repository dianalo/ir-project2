The difficulties range from fuel-tank leaksto the engine problems.;    The aircraft was conspicuous by its absence in theallied air attack in the Persian Gulf war.;    The Pentagon maintains thebomber can carry both conventional and nuclear weapons and would only be usedin the event of a Soviet nuclear attack. It also says the aging B-52 bombers,which the B-1s are supposed to replace, are better able to handle conventionalbombing operations.;    '$30 billion missing link';  But critics and even someproponents say the aircraft's extensive problems have prevented the Air Forcefrom using the plane.;    &quot;The B-1 was to fill the void between our agingB-52s and the unneeded, next-generation Stealth bomber, but appears to be a$30 billion missing link,&quot; said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., chairman of theHouse Government Operations Committee.;    The panel plans to hold a hearingon the aircraft later this week.;    Apprised of the committee's findings andConyers' complaints, an Air Force spokesman said the allegations regarding themission capability of the aircraft and deicing have long since been resolved.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910304  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  299  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday March 4, 199100064192,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
