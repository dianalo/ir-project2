Bishop   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/14/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B4</SO><IN>MEDICAL AND BIOTECHNOLOGY (MTC)</IN><LP>   A technique for inserting new genes into specific tissuesin the body is being developed at the University of Michiganin Ann Arbor.   In experiments on pigs, researchers there inserted a newgene into cells of a small, limited section of an artery. Thegenetically altered cells then began producing a new protein,the product of the new gene, the Michigan scientists reportedin this week's issue of the journal Science.</LP><TEXT>   The technique holds promise of a new way to treat diseasessuch as heart disease and cancer as well as genetic diseases,said Elizabeth Nabel, Gregory Plautz and Gary Nabel, of theinternal medicine department at the Michigan medical school.Gary Nabel, who is Elizabeth Nabel's husband, also is withthe Howard Hughes Medical Institute on the Michigan campus.   A potential beneficiary of the new technique might, forexample, be a heart patient whose clogged coronary arterieshave just been reopened by surgery or other techniques. Withthe new technique, a gene that produced a clot-preventingprotein could be introduced into the wall of the newlyreopened section of the artery, thereby preventing a clotfrom forming and plugging the artery a second time.Alternatively, a gene might be inserted that preventedarterial cells from proliferating into a new, artery-cloggingdeposit, the scientists suggested.   Another possibility, the researchers said, would be totake a gene that produced a protein that activates the immunesystem and insert it into the walls of blood vessels thatsupplied a malignant tumor. This way, the immune system mightbe triggered to launch a powerful but localized attack on thetumor.   The experimental Michigan technique differs fromtechniques planned for human gene therapy experiments thatwere approved by federal regulators at the end of July. Inthe latter experiments, scientists will inject volunteerpatients with blood cells that have been genetically alteredin the test tube. The gene-altered blood cells, it's hoped,will produce proteins that will cure a devastating geneticdefect in one experiment and a lethal skin cancer in anotherexperiment.   In contrast, the Michigan scientists hope to insert newgenes directly into tissues in the body, rather than intest-tube grown cells, and to confine the genetic alterationto specific organs or anatomical sites rather thancirculating gene-altered blood cells throughout the body.   In their pig experiments, the Michigan scientists saidthey took a mouse virus long used in medical research andgave it a new gene that produces a protein calledbeta-galactosidase. The protein turns blue when exposed to acertain chemical, enabling researchers to tell which tissueswere producing the protein and which weren't.   A thin catheter with two balloons along its tip wasinserted into a thigh artery of each of 10 pigs. The twoballoons, separated by less than an inch of space, wereinflated, blocking the artery fore and aft. The geneticallyaltered virus was injected into the space between the twoballoons and allowed to infect the nearby walls of theartery.   Subsequent tests with the blue-staining chemical showedthat the cells of the artery walls from infected pigs wereproducing the beta-galactosidase protein and were still doingso as long as 21 weeks later. Equally important from a safetyviewpoint, tests of other tissues such as the lungs, liverand kidneys for the protein were negative, indicating thatthe genetic alteration was confined to the short section ofthe thigh artery.   The experiments show that the technique allows &quot;theintroduction of recombinant genes into any site accessible toa catheter,&quot; the researchers said. The technique doesn'trequire several weeks of advanced preparation of cells in thetest tube and thus it should help make gene therapy easierand more widely applicable, the scientists said.</TEXT></DOC>
