The letter to Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, releasedMonday, also raised questions about safety and environmentalpractices at Pantex, the nation's only final assembly plant fornuclear bombs and missile warheads.   The committee said the response to the May release of tritium, aradioactive gas, was of ``variable quality.''   Radiation specialists and technicians responded properly tominimize workers' exposure at the plant, the report said.   ``Missing was recognition that this `unlikely event' could takeplace, and thus adequate procedures, instrumentation and trainingwere lacking,'' the letter said.   Although a quick and effective evacuation was conducted,thereafter, ``events are marked by confusion, misread instrumentsand uncertain actions. There appeared to be no plan to handle whatsurely must be an anticipated accident,'' the report said.   Pantex spokesman Tom Walton said the plant has begun correctingproblems or ``will be addressing those in the very near future.''Some safety violations were corrected on the spot.   The report said cleaning up the facility after the accident wasestimated to cost $1 million ``and the psychological trauma on theindividuals exposed.''   Exposure to workers, however, was below federal guidelineslimiting radiation exposure and ``off-site exposure was trivial.''   The letter said the committee found a ``lack of belief thatPantex can have radiological accidents, in spite of the recenttritium accident.''   A ``tiger team'' of government and outside experts also recentlyinspected the plant and found Pantex would be unable to respondeffectively to emergencies involving releases of radioactivematerial.   Watkins said those findings indicate workers lack adequateprotection from emergency and routine exposure to radioactivereleases and that the situation must be corrected immediately.   The advisory committee, which spent two days in Amarillo lastmonth, found ``an apparent lack of sophistication and depthregarding environmental problems'' at Pantex.   Monitoring of possible ground water contamination with wells atPantex also has been less than systematic, the letter said.   ``This issue has just not received a great deal of attention.This is particularly unfortunate since ground water contamination,if found, would be a threat to the sole source of drinking waterfor the area,'' the letter said.</TEXT></DOC>
