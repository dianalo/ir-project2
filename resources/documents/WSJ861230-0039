As previously reported, the proposal will give the Common Market 30 days to reach an agreement with the U.S. before retaliatory duties are imposed. The announcement will be made in California by U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.    The dispute with the Common Market started in January, when Spain and Portugal joined the group. The U.S. contends that new tariffs imposed by Spain would cost U.S. farm exporters as much as $500 million a year in grain sales.    Under an interim agreement that expires tomorrow, the Common Market had guaranteed the U.S. a fixed amount of sales through the end of the year. Some officials speculate that the two sides will reach agreement before the retaliatory duties take effect.    Mr. Yeutter also will announce details of the administration's agreement to give Brazil another six months to meet U.S. demands to ease restrictions on computer imports before the U.S. carries out a threat to retaliate. </TEXT></DOC>
