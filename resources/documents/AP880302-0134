Bruce Phillips, attorney for Joseph Paolino andamp; Sons Inc., whichhas a contract with the city to dispose of the ash, said the KhianSea would be allowed to dock at Paolino's pier only after there isan agreement on cleaning up the ash in Gonaives, Haiti.   ``We want an enforceable covenant that the material will beremoved from Haiti or disposed of in an environmentally soundmanner,'' Phillips said.   Robert Cordes, president of the ship's operator, AmalgamatedShipping Co. of Freeport, Bahamas, declined to comment when reachedat his office by The Philadelphia Inquirer.   Phillips said Paolino will not be paid unless it can show theash has been disposed of legally.   The ship had been turned away from six countries while wanderingthe Caribbean and the Atlantic seeking a dumping spot. It anchoredat the mouth of Delaware Bay, north of Lewes, Del., on Tuesday.   In addition to the question about the ash in Haiti, the ship's80-mile voyage up the Delaware River to Philadelphia was delayed byinspections and a pier fire.   The Coast Guard refused to allow the ship to proceed until itpassed an inpsection by the American Bureau of Shipping.   The Coast Guard said this morning that the ship passed aninspection conducted Tuesday, and that the captain of the port hasdetermined the ship is ``safe to transit U.S. waters,'' the coastguard said.   No time was set for the Khian Sea to travel upriver. Its radarsystem still didn't work and the coast guard said the ship isrestricted to daytime traveling.   The environmental group Greenpeace has labeled the Khian Sea'scargo toxic. State tests conducted when the ash was loaded found nodangerous levels of toxins, and recent federal tests from the sameincinerator came to the same conclusions.   The Fire Department, meanwhile, is investigating a rubbish fireat the Paolini pier this morning. The fire damaged a transferstation, a company official said.   Coast Guard spokesman Scott Miller said the city will appoint anindependent engineering firm to determine the safety of the pierand whether the Khian Sea will be able to dock there.   Paolino is expected to send the residue to an Ohio landfill,where the bulk of the city's ash has been dumped for the past twoyears, said Phillips.</TEXT></DOC>
