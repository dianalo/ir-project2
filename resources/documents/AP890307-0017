RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Conflicts are sure to continue among thenation's courts over the use of corporal punishment in publicschools due to the Supreme Court's reluctance to address the issue.   The court on Monday refused, without comment, to review a Texaslaw that permitted two kindergarten girls to be paddled severely forsnickering.   Lawyers for the girls cited Department of Education studiesindicating that 30,000 American schoolchildren are physicallyinjured each year ``because of the infliction of corporal punishmentto a degree that requires medical treatment.''   Their appeal said those studies estimate ``at least 100,000children develop emotional and learning disabilities from excessiveand inappropriate school punishment each year.''   The American Medical Association and the National Committee forPrevention of Child Abuse also urged the justices to hear argumentsin the case.   But the court left unresolved whether the Constitution affordsany protection against corporal punishment by teachers and schooladministrators.   Left intact is a Texas law that allows the use of all necessarycorporal punishment, short of deadly force.   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Texas law, butother federal appeals courts have made it easier for schoolchildrento sue in such cases. For example, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals ruled in a New Mexico case that ``at some degree ofexcessiveness or cruelty'' such punishment violates constitutionalrights.   The justices in 1977 ruled that public school disciplinarymeasures involving physical force do not amount to ``cruel andunusual punishment'' banned by the Constitution's Eighth Amendment.   While the decision barred students from suing teachers and schooladministrators in federal court over alleged Eighth Amendmentviolations, it left them free to sue in state courts under statelaws.   The 1977 decision left it unclear whether corporal punishmentever may violate the Constitution's 14th Amendment that protects dueprocess rights.   The case the court turned aside Monday came from Jacksonville,Texas, where on May 6, 1987, Crystal Cunningham, 5, and AshleyJohnson, 6, were paddled twice _ once by their school principal andonce by their teacher.   Mary Sue Bruno, the principal at Westside Kindergarten School,saw the two girls snickering in the hall and gave each child twoswats on the buttocks with a wooden paddle.   When the girls returned to the classroom, teacher Rosa Cook sawthem still snickering. She took the girls into the hallway and gaveeach three more swats across the buttocks with a wooden paddle.   Each girl missed six days of school. The lawsuit filed in theirbehalf said the reason for their absence was ``severe pain'' andfear of returning to school.   According to court documents, both girls were taken to a childwelfare office where social workers who examined the paddlingbruises said the two had been subjected to child abuse.   The children's federal lawsuit _ dismissed by a judge _ soughtmonetary damages in alleging the girls were victims of conduct thatwas ``excessive, brutal, disproportionate to the circumstances (and)shocking to the conscience.''   In other action Monday, the Supreme Court:   _Ruled that people accused of drunken driving usually have noright to a jury trial if they face a jail term of no more than sixmonths. The court said unanimously in a Nevada case that states donot violate fair-trial rights by treating drunken driving as a pettyoffense not warranting trial by jury.   _Rejected an appeal by Northeastern states seeking to force thefederal government to crack down on acid rain and other pollutionthey say is caused by factories and power plants in other states.   _Agreed to review the fines imposed against four Yonkers, N.Y.,councilmen for defying a federal judge's order to adopt a housingdesegregation plan.   _Agreed to decide in a case from Washington state whether aprison inmate is entitled to a court hearing and otherconstitutional safeguards before being forced to take anti-psychoticdrugs.</TEXT></DOC>
