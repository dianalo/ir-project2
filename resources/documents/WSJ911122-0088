Teleport executives said the company within a couple ofweeks will file with Illinois's chief utility regulatoryagency a request to expand the private-line services it nowsells Chicago-area businesses into public switched services.These would compete directly with the local phone monopoly,Illinois Bell Telephone Co.</LP><TEXT>   Illinois's chief regulator says he will work hard tosupport Teleport's plan to become Chicago's second phonecompany. &quot;Teleport is going to ask for permission to providea public switched service . . . {that} would ultimately meanthe break up of the local monopoly,&quot; said Terrence Barnich,chairman of the Illinois Commerce Commission. &quot;This will bethe most significant event since {the American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co.} divestiture. And I would give them permissionto do it.&quot;   &quot;That's a powerful message from a local regulator,&quot; notesKenneth Leon, telecommunications analyst at Bear Stearns andamp;Co. In fact, he says a rivalry is growing among regulators instates such as New York and Illinois to lower the barriersfor alternative carriers such as New York-based Teleport andMetropolitan Fiber Systems Inc., which is based in OakbrookTerrace, Ill.   Any inroad by an alternative carrier such as Teleport intothe local phone services market could ultimately bringgreater competition and drive down local phone rates, whichunlike long-distance rates, have barely budged since thebreakup of ATandamp;T in 1984.   &quot;The customers are getting a choice they didn't havebefore. It's going to put pressure on the local operatingcompany to lower pricing, and provide network redundancy&quot; inthe event of a network outage, says Mr. Leon.   The local phone monopoly may benefit, too, since morecompetition could help it win deregulation. &quot;We have alwaysbeen pro-competitive . . . ever since the divestiture&quot; ofATandamp;T, says John Ake, vice president of regulatory affairs atIllinois Bell. But, &quot;if competition is going to enter ourmarket, {then} we have to be able to price our services toour costs in places where we're seeing competition. . . .We'd like more flexibility than we have now.&quot;   Teleport, which is 100%-controlled by Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.,has installed highly efficient fiber-optic communications&quot;loops&quot; in New York, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, LosAngeles, Dallas and Houston. Teleport uses these lines toprovide private-line voice and data communications servicesto businesses. Merrill recently agreed to sell a 12.5% stakein the company to cable operator Cox Enterprises Inc., whichhad been seeking to expand into local telecommunicationsservices as a way of finding more local cable subscribers.   The first step in Teleport's Chicago expansion would be toinstall a multimillion-dollar switching center that wouldprovide so-called Centrex-type and shared-tenant services tobusinesses in Chicago, said Scott Bonney, Teleport's directorof regulatory affairs. Most of these customers are currentlyserved by Illinois Bell, which is owned by Ameritech, one ofthe seven regional Bell companies.   By the middle of next year, Mr. Bonney said, Teleport willtake the second step and ask the Illinois agency to requireIllinois Bell to provide alternative carriers access topieces of the phone company's network, including subscriberlines, so that Teleport and others could provide their ownswitched service and even billing to customers. In addition,he said Teleport will ask the commission to have the phonecompany make physical connections to its local lines moreaccessible and allow the alternative carriers to assign andservice customer phone numbers.   &quot;Our ultimate goal is to become the second phone companyin the Chicago area . . . and in all the other areas in whichwe now operate,&quot; Mr. Bonney said.   Illinois Commerce Commission Chief Barnich acknowledges hemust line up at least four commission votes out of seven toopen up the local phone network to a second carrier. But hesays he already has two votes, his and commissioner CalvinManshio's. &quot;He's collaborated with me on this, and I haven'teven gone searching for the other votes.&quot; Mr. Manshiocouldn't be reached for comment.   Alternative carriers have been gaining more ground latelyin their turf battle with the local monopolies. Last spring,the Federal Communications Commission proposed thatfiber-optic companies such as Teleport be allowed to connecttheir networks to phone systems run by the regional Bellcompanies and GTE Corp. for equal access to interstatelong-distance networks. The FCC has yet to issue a finalorder on its proposal, which would allow phone companycompetitors to monitor and control their own circuits, andwould require the local phone companies to make certainequipment available to rivals such as Teleport.   The FCC's proposal is initially limited to private-lineservices that corporations could use to connect branchoffices or other buildings through the public network.However, the commission also is considering allowingalternative carriers to plug into local phone networks andprovide public-switched service when it is used to access along-distance company.   In April, Illinois Bell began allowing Teleport and otheralternative carriers to connect to its network and providebusiness customers with a backup telecommunications systemthat can prevent interruptions in service during a networkoutage. However, the service is limited to intrastatehigh-speed, digital private-line service and other servicesdedicated to a particular customer. It doesn't includeinterstate or switched services, such as Centrex and what theindustry calls &quot;plain-old telephone service,&quot; or POTS, whichMr. Bonney says Teleport ultimately wants to provide.   Centrex is a type of phone service for businesses thatuses the phone company public-network switching facilitiesrather than private switching facilities owned by thebusiness customer itself. Shared-tenant service is a servicethat extends these Centrex-type services to corporate tenantsin a single building.   Teleport's plan is to expand into a regular local phoneservice. &quot;We already have two switches in New York and weplan to put one in Chicago,&quot; said Mr. Bonney. &quot;We're notmaking this investment of millions of dollars in switchingequipment just to provide Centrex. That second switch isgoing to be used to become the second phone company.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
