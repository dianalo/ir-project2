It represents one of the five parts forming UNEP's comprehensivestudy on cogeneration of electricity and heat in developing countries.The other parts of the study deal with cogeneration in district heatingand cooling, cogeneration in fresh water production and other applicationsof waste heat. The publication consists of a short revision of the principleof cogeneration cycles, which in spite of their tremendous potentialfor energy conservation and environment protection, are still almostunknown to the majority of developing countries. It is followed by selectedexamples of modern utilization of cogeneration in industry. These aregiven in some detail with emphasis on the industries of particular interestto developing countries. The use of alternative fuels in cogeneration,particularly non-commercial fuels, like rice hull, wood and agriculturalwastes, slurry, etc., is of particular importance in developing countries.For this reason examples of most recent applications of cogenerationusing alternative fuels are discussed. This is followed by considerationof the economic and social aspects of cogeneration. Finally, a few conclusionsand general guiding steps suggested for developing countries interestedin cogeneration are given.</TEXT></DOC>
