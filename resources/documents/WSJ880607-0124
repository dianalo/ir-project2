Winter (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> MON IND </IN><TEXT>   Cautiously, U.S. manufacturers are adding plant capacity again.    After six years of streamlining, many companies are deciding that the dollar has dropped enough -- and stayed down long enough -- to risk major expansion. Some of their new facilities will make goods for export. Others will be used for home-grown products that will replace imports.    Last year, non-residential fixed investment, a broad measure of business spending for buildings and equipment, edged up just 1%. But according to a consensus forecast of 50 leading economists in Blue Chip Economic Indicators, an economic newsletter, the gain this year will be an inflation-adjusted 8.9%. Such an increase would raise outlays to nearly $490 billion, well above the previous high of $454.1 billion in 1985. The latest Commerce Department survey of spending plans indicates an identical 8.9% rise for manufacturers alone.    This business-investment spurt, coupled with the shrinking trade gap, has contributed most of the buoyancy in the nation's economy this spring, countering constrained consumer and government spending.    &quot;The U.S. is now the low-cost place to produce high value-added goods,&quot; contends Adrian T. Dillon, chief economist at Eaton Corp., which makes truck parts and electrical and electronic products. Wage rates are competitive, productivity high &quot;and capital goods less costly than anyplace else in the world,&quot; he says.    Factoring in political stability and access to the world's richest market makes it even clearer why domestic and foreign concerns are expanding their U.S. manufacturing operations. In addition, surging exports and solid domestic demand have sparked higher prices and wider profit margins for makers of an array of products. Those strong profits provide internally generated cash to finance the fresh spending.    Mead Corp.'s addition to a coated paperboard mill illustrates this willingness to expand. The $500 million project at its Cottonton, Ala., facility is the largest ever for the Dayton, Ohio-based forest-products and electronic-publishing company -- and its first major construction in six years. Surging demand for coated paperboard prompted the expansion.    What Mead isn't doing is equally revealing. It isn't increasing printing-paper capacity at its Escanaba, Mich., mill, despite the current heavy demand. &quot;We don't want to start there until we have this other project pretty well along,&quot; says Burnell R. Roberts, chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;In 1982, we were bringing on capacity three places -- and the economy went south.&quot;    Still, with factories operating at 83% of capacity in April -- the highest level in nine years and usually the trigger point for plant expansion -- many companies must expand or lose market share. &quot;When the salesman tells the boss 'we're losing sales to the other guy because we can't meet delivery schedules,' attitudes change,&quot; says Paul G. Schloemer, president and chief executive officer of Parker Hannifin Corp., a Cleveland-based motion-control equipment concern.    Of course, building a major new plant is far riskier than buying computers and other equipment to pare costs. Such lower-risk investment has dominated U.S. capital spending since the early 1980s, when the pain of shutting down plants became firmly etched in directors' memories.    By the time a new plant is completed, the nation could be mired in another recession. Widely fluctuating currencies increase the risk. Timken Co., a maker of specialty steels and roller bearings, piled up hefty losses in 1985 and 1986 when imported steel drove down prices just as the Canton, Ohio-based company's new specialty steel mill started operations.    Mead and other companies with major building projects often cite export sales as a factor in their decisions. For Mead, &quot;this is the first capital investment we've made in the U.S. aimed at foreign markets,&quot; Mr. Roberts says. The company expects to export about half the coated paperboard produced by the new mill, with 25% going to Europe and 25% to Japan and other countries on the Pacific rim. Even if the dollar rises significantly, exports from the mill would still be profitable, says Steven C. Mason, president.    In the Far East, consumers demand attractive packaging, says Tom Johnson, president of Mead's coated-board division. His unit's product has an especially good printing surface, providing colorful packaging for Asian-made toys, sporting goods and other items sold to U.S. discount stores, and enticing Asian customers to try items like frozen foods.    Much new plant capacity reflects the prospering U.S. economy rather than developments in world trade. The Bruce Hardwood Floors division of Dallas-based Triangle Pacific Corp. is building a new hardwood-flooring plant in Port Gibson, Miss., and plans to start construction next month of a $37.7 million flooring mill in Beverly, W.Va., to turn local oak timber into plank and parquet flooring.    &quot;Demand is soaring, and we want to be there first,&quot; says Joseph McHugh, senior executive vice president of Bruce. Hardwood floors are in vogue these days, especially for the more expensive new homes, he says.    Many U.S. basic-materials industries -- chemicals, plastic resins and paper, among others -- are running at full capacity, justifying the addition of capacity. Early this decade, in some industries like plastic resins, plants were closed and new capacity was nonexistent. In addition, there was fear that soaring oil prices would make plastics costs noncompetitive. &quot;That didn't happen,&quot; notes William S. Stavropoulous, a Dow Chemical Co. plastics official.    Consequently, plastics producers are scrambling to meet the demand triggered by shrinking imports, expanded exports and changes in auto, construction and packaging technology. Dow Chemical's capital spending is slated to rise 20% this year to $1.2 billion as the Midland, Mich., company builds fresh capacity for polycarbonate, polyethylene and polystyrene plastic resins.    In some industries from tires to pipe fittings, reduced imports have led to expansion. Even the import-devastated domestic iron and steel industry is spending modestly for added capacity -- albeit mostly to restore mothballed facilities to working order. At its Forbes, Minn., iron-ore pellet facility, Cleveland-based Oglebay Norton Co. is restarting a second pellet production line that has been closed since the 1982 recession.    Another factor sparking capital spending is foreign-owned or joint-venture plants in the U.S. that produce goods from machine tools to computer printers that can no longer be imported economically.    Much of the capacity added this year will show up in the figures for equipment purchased to more intensively use existing facilities. Cooper Industries Inc., a Houston-based producer of tools, compressors, lighting and electrical products, will raise spending 20% this year to about $120 million, but there's little new construction, says Dewain Cross, senior vice president-finance.    &quot;We're buying more efficient machine tools,&quot; he explains. The company is also reducing its inventory and stacking what's left 20 to 30 feet high to open up more space for production.    Reflecting that trend, &quot;there's a boom in garden-variety industrial equipment,&quot; says Eaton's Mr. Dillon. After a three-year plateau, such orders are up nearly 25% this year. </TEXT></DOC>
