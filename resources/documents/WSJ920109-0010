That's the view of a growing number of oil analysts andofficials at Western energy think tanks, who are reassessingthe oil picture in Russia and the other republics. They agreethere is no question that oil production is continuing toplunge. But they say the former union's exports of petroleumare no longer falling as fast as output.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Production could fall another one million barrels a daythis year,&quot; says Lawrence Goldstein, president of businessdevelopment for Petroleum Industry Research Associates(PIRA), &quot;but exports will be down only about 200,000 to300,000 barrels a day.&quot;   Several reasons are cited, but the chief factor isdeclining oil consumption in the former union. Domesticconsumption in Russia and the other republics is droppingnearly as fast as production is falling, says Mr. Goldstein.He forecasts internal Soviet oil demand will be down around700,000 barrels a day this year.   Any easing of the long slide in Soviet petroleum exports,currently around two million barrels a day, is likely to havea significant impact on the world's oil industry as well asoil markets. It could contribute to added weakness inpetroleum prices, which already are falling, unless world oildemand suddenly surges or there are supply disruptionselsewhere. Oil prices fell again yesterday, with the futuresprice of the U.S. crude for February delivery dropping 82cents to $17.87 a barrel.   Pessimistic projections for Soviet oil were chieflyresponsible for keeping a floor under world petroleum pricesfor much of last year. It still is widely assumed oil exportsfrom Russia and the other republics could drop to near zerothis winter, the peak period for world demand, or later thisyear. Also, such leading producers as Saudi Arabia andVenezuela have cited the crumbling oil picture in the formerunion as a basis for further postponing any return to outputquotas in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   Until it broke up, the Soviet Union was the world's singlelargest oil producer. Its output totaled more than 12 millionbarrels a day as recently as 1989. Current production in therepublics is now down to 10 million barrels a day or less,although output is still ahead of Saudi Arabia's 8.5 millionbarrels a day or U.S. volume of just under 7.4 millionbarrels a day.   Russia is responsible for some 90% of the former union'stotal oil output. It also accounts for the bulk of theexports, which have been dropping steadily for the past twoyears. Exports fell by one-third -- an estimated one millionbarrels a day -- just in 1991.   But the new studies suggest export volumes have begun tolevel. According to some experts on Soviet oil, exports couldeven rise again soon, if only briefly. All cite the expecteddemand declines.   The International Energy Agency, the Paris-based groupthat represents the major Western oil consuming nations, mayrevise its forecasts for Soviet oil supplies and demand inits next monthly oil market report, which is due out nextweek. But in its early December report, the agency projectedthat oil demand in the former Soviet Union would be around8.3 million barrels a day in the 1992 first quarter and only7.7 million barrels a day in the second. Each is down 500,000barrels a day from the year-earlier periods.   PIRA, the New York-based consulting firm Mr. Goldstein isassociated with, concludes in its study of the oil future ofthe 15 republics that major declines have been taking placein energy consumption in industry, the military andelectricity generation. Oil demand has been declining since1985, the PIRA report notes, and is likely to fall a furthertwo million barrels a day from current levels, before itbottoms out as the economy eventually turns around.   &quot;World oil prices will be affected in the medium term asmuch by developments on the demand side, with thetwo-million-barrels-a-day decline, as by the much-discusseddecline in Russia's oil production,&quot; the PIRA reportcontinues. It projects oil exports to be &quot;roughly flat&quot; overthe next few years -- with modest growth after 1995.   The new assessments of the Soviet energy situation citepolitical and economic chaos as a major factor in thedeclines in demand. In its recent survey of the oil and gasindustries of the former union, Cambridge Energy ResearchAssociates suggests that the consequences of the severeeconomic slump it anticipates could be a &quot;major onslaught&quot; ofSoviet commodities -- including energy -- onto the worldmarkets.   &quot;Already, growing amounts of oil, seeking hard currency,have been finding their way to world markets through new andunofficial channels,&quot; says Thane Gustafson, an expert on theSoviet Union who wrote the Cambridge Energy report. With theweakening of political power and the loss of central controlover exports of oil, he says, producers and refiners in theformer union are developing their own private commoditiesmarkets and are trading oil independently, to take advantageof the wide differences between world prices and the officialdomestic prices.   Mr. Gustafson also criticizes some widely publicizedpredictions made last year that the former union could becomean oil importer by the mid-1990s. &quot;The argument is fallaciousbecause the depression has not yet bitten seriously intoenergy consumption,&quot; he says. By 1995, he says, a 30% fall intotal energy consumption is possible.   Still, some oil analysts advise caution in adopting asanguine view about Soviet oil. Although demand for oil willbe down this year, &quot;production is going to fall more thandemand,&quot; says Michael Rothman, a senior energy futuresanalyst at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.</TEXT></DOC>
