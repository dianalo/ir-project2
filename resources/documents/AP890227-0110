Price riots and general strikes nearly four years ago promptedthe army to oust President Gaafar Nimeiri, who had ruled Sudan for16 years. Mahdi's civilian government was elected a year later.   Mahdi's comments were made in a speech to Parliament on Monday _the deadline the military gave him a week ago for choosing a newCabinet and trying to end the 6-year-old civil war in southern Sudan.   Army officials did not say what they would do if Mahdi did notmeet their conditions and had no immediate reaction to his speech,but sources in the military said privately the high command wasassessing it.   On their clandestine radio station, the rebels claimed to havecaptured Torit, a strategic garrison town in Equatoria province thathad been under siege for months.   Mahdi told Parliament the army ultimatum did not threaten a coup,then demanded assurances there would not be one. After the ultimatumwas issued Feb. 20, a military spokesman said he would not describeit as a coup threat.   The army made its demands after Defense Minister Abdel-MeguidKhalil resigned.   Khalil quit in protest of the government's refusal to endorse apeace agreement proposed in November by the Democratic UnionistParty, which was part of the government coalition at the time, andthe rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army.   After Mahdi refused to submit the plan to the Cabinet orParliament, the Unionists left the government.   Four gunmen opened fire Monday on the house of Syd Ahmed AliMirghani, whose brother, Mohammed Osman, is the Democratic UnionistParty leader, and fled when guards returned the fire. No injurieswere reported.   Syd Ahmed Ali Mirghani heads the Sudanese Council of State, acollective presidency, and is a member of Khatmiya, one of Sudan'stwo principal Moslem sects. Mahdi leads the other sect, Ansar.   Three people were arrested later Monday and the van was found,the official Sudan News Agency reported.   A similar attack was made on Mohammed Osman Mirghani's home inNovember, also with no injuries.   Mahdi said Monday he would ``make efforts'' to form a broad-basedgovernment to create political unity and end the war.   Rebels led by John Garang, a former army colonel, seek moreeconomic advantages for the south, most of whose people are blackChristians or animists, and autonomy from the the overwhelminglyArab and Moslem north.   In its broadcast, the rebel radio said Torit, 750 miles south ofKhartoum, was captured on Sunday. It said two senior army officers,a brigadier and a colonel, and the provincial commissioner weretaken prisoner.   There was no confirmation from the government. Independentverification of such claims is impossible because travel in thesouth is not permitted.   If the report is true, Torit would be the eighth major town tofall to rebels in Equatoria and Upper Nile provinces.   Rebels occupied Liria, 45 miles southeast of the provincialcapital Juba, 10 days ago, cutting Torit off from government supplylines. Juba is one of the main rebel targets.   The prime minister said Sudan would be receiving aircraft, tanks,rocket launchers, long-range artillery, an air-defense system,gunboats and other weapons, but did not say who would supply them.</TEXT></DOC>
