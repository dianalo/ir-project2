Most of the strong gains were made early in the day, traders said, as world oil markets reacted to Saturday's announcement that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had agreed to slash output, and will return to a fixed price of $18 a barrel. Just after the opening at the New York Mercantile Exchange, for instance, crude oil prices leaped to a high of $17.50 a barrel.    But prices eased for the remainder of the session as some traders expressed skepticism about whether the agreement would last, analysts said. While traders were excited by the OPEC pact, &quot;The initial burst of buying was quickly outweighed by profit-taking,&quot; said John Azarow, senior energy trader at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York.    Crude oil prices for February delivery on the New York Merc closed at $17.22 a barrel, up 83 cents for the day. The price was the highest since Feb. 7, when crude oil contracts settled at $17.68, the exchange said; it also was the first time since May that U.S. crude oil prices surpassed the $17-a-barrel level. Heating oil and unleaded gasoline futures prices soared, too, with some contracts rising the daily limit of two cents a gallon.    Spot, or noncontract, prices, also advanced in brisk trading. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the barometer of U.S. crude oil prices, rose 70 cents, to $16.90 a barrel. And the price of North Sea Brent, the abundantly traded European blend, rose 75 cents, to $17.10 in late trading.    Some analysts and traders were optimistic about the cartel's chances for a lasting accord. &quot;OPEC has turned the corner,&quot; said Peter Cardillo, futures trading adviser for Josephthal andamp; Co., New York, adding that any production excesses by OPEC members will be offset by sacrifices by Saudi Arabia, the cartel's largest producer.    Some of the optimists saw unique characteristics in the latest OPEC accord. Mehdi Varzi, oil analyst for Kleinwort Grieveson andamp; Co., London, and former Iranian diplomat, noted that this is the first agreement in which Saudi Arabia and Iran, typically antagonists, are on the same side. &quot;All in all, this is a healthy agreement,&quot; Mr. Varzi said, adding that he expects U.S. oil prices will rise to $18 a barrel before Thursday.    Others were skeptical, however. &quot;The Saudis and OPEC have never been able to live up to past agreements,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, oil analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York. &quot;There's no reason to believe it will happen in the future.&quot;    And some market participants said that with the holidays approaching and trading relatively thin, the futures market hasn't fully digested the production pact. &quot;It will take a little while for traders to step back, give it the once-over, and see if it's as strong as they would like to believe,&quot; said Dennis Winters, oil broker for PrudentialBache Securities Inc. in Boston.    In the meantime, some analysts said, prices are likely to remain firm. &quot;We've moved into a higher plateau,&quot; to $16 to $18 from $14 to $16, said Richard Marose, senior oil analyst for Geldermann Inc., Chicago. &quot;Now, we'll wait and see if there's some follow-through,&quot; he added.    Meanwhile, precious metals prices, which often reflect gains in oil, closed mixed in light trading. A lack of bullion buying has far outweighed the oil price rally and a lower U.S. dollar, traders said. &quot;This indicates there's fundamental weakness in the metals market and says it's going to have to work its way lower to attract physical buying,&quot; one trader in New York said.    In other futures markets yesterday:    LIVESTOCK AND MEAT: Pork belly and hog futures prices could firm up slightly today, following a favorable hog and pig report that was released by the Agriculture Department after the market closed yesterday, analysts said. The report showed 3% declines in the breeding-herd population, the number of animals being prepared for slaughter and the total population, compared with a year ago. Intended farrowing, or births, from December through May are expected to rise 2% from the year-earlier period. These numbers are in line with previously reported analysts' expectations. During trading yesterday, prices for hogs and pork bellies were down as traders feared the report would show major, rather than slight, expansion in the industry, analysts said.    STOCK INDEXES: Futures closed little changed in light trading, a moderately bullish sign, analysts said. Many traders had expected stock futures to decline yesterday after frenzied triple-witching-hour trading Friday. On Friday, the March Standard andamp; Poor's 500 future closed nearly a full point below the cash index, compared with a theoretical premium based on the three months left in the contract. Yesterday, the spread of March futures over cash narrowed to 0.05 point. &quot;Despite heavy volume on Friday and a lot of expectations for a strong sell-off today, it turned out to be business as usual,&quot; said Norman Mains, a first vice president of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Chicago. &quot;This is an indication that people are more positive.&quot;    COFFEE: Futures prices fell on profit-taking after Friday's rally, with most of the action spurred by locals, or those trading for their own accounts, brokers said. Some traders said that prices may soon rise above the current depressed levels on growing speculation that U.S. roasters may not have enough coffee to last through the peak demand of the winter season. &quot;Roasters' inventories are relatively big, but they may not have quite enough for the entire season,&quot; one trader in New York said. </TEXT></DOC>
