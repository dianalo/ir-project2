Pennzoil v. Texaco proved that even the most outrageous claim can be worth $12 billion. Unocal hopes it's next. The company is suing Goldman Sachs for a cool $2.5 billion arising from the anti-takeover defense that kept Unocal out of the hands of T. Boone Pickens.    In papers filed in California state court, Unocal claims that Goldman, the main defendant, gave &quot;tainted and biased&quot; advice that caused the company in 1985 to pay more than it needed to when it bought back its own shares. Goldman bankers concocted the plan whereby Unocal bought back its shares, except those held by Mr. Pickens. Unocal took on a lot of debt, but the managers kept their jobs.    The gist of the claim is that the reason Goldman advised Unocal to pay as much as it did to its stockholders is that Goldman was one of them. It held Unocal options. The complaint says, &quot;Unocal was damaged in that it accepted Goldman Sachs' advice&quot; on the premium to pay. It notes that Robert Freeman, Goldman's head arbitrager, is charged with leaking information about the Unocal defense.    The biggest problem with this lawsuit stems from the confusion over determining who is harmed by &quot;insider trading.&quot; To wit: Where's the victim? Unocal's startling claim is that Goldman somehow forced it to do too well by its own shareholders.    Coincidentally, federal Judge Ann Williams in Chicago earlier this month dismissed a similar lawsuit by holding that before claiming a loss from insider trading, there first has to be a victim. A company isn't victimized when it returns assets to its own shareholders.    That case was FMC Corp. v. Ivan Boesky, Goldman Sachs, Drexel Burnham and Shearson Lehman Bros., among others, claiming that insider trading cost the company $225 million. Like Unocal, FMC claimed it paid its own shareholders too much in a stock buyback because bankers leaked news of the buyback to Ivan Boesky, who bought FMC shares.    Judge Williams accepted the defendants' motion for summary judgment. That is, even assuming FMC's allegations were true, she could see from reading the legal complaint that FMC had no standing to sue because it wasn't harmed. The judge said there was no merit to FMC's complaint that it paid too much to its own shareholders. The company suffered no loss when its shareholders got their shares bought back at a premium above the market price. Indeed, the more stock at a higher price that the company bought back, the better off shareholders were. (This association of shareholders, of course, gives the word &quot;corporation&quot; its meaning.) Judge Williams noted that the shareholders got a cash distribution &quot;perhaps made greater by Boesky's conduct&quot; because his purchases drove up the buyback price.    Judge Williams's unassailable conclusion was that a company isn't hurt by the profit of its shareholders. Otherwise, she wrote, FMC would be &quot;allowed to shift corporate assets from the left pocket to the right pocket, and then to refill the left pocket by recovery from the defendants.&quot;    So Unocal may not have much of a case either. Still, the size of the claim makes it a threat. An internal memo distributed at Goldman after the Unocal filing reassured the staff that its activities were &quot;entirely ethical.&quot;    Goldman says it had both puts and calls in Unocal shares before Unocal became a client, but -- contrary to Unocal's claim that these were secret -- the holdings were publicly reported. When Unocal became a client, Goldman froze the stock. This meant the option was automatically exercised on the closing date.    Regardless of the propriety of the Goldman options, the advice Goldman gave was notable for not maximizing shareholder value. Goldman and other Unocal shareholders would have made more if Unocal had accepted Mr. Pickens's higher bid. Unocal may still have a claim for breach of the confidentiality clause of the contract with its bankers, but damages wouldn't exceed the size of Goldman's fee of $17 million.    Unocal can't be blamed entirely for trying to cash in on the lack of clarity in insider-trading law. However, it's important in the current muddled atmosphere to resolve quickly the question of who exactly insider trading practices victimize. It is not the shareholder who sells at a premium to someone who had more information than he had. Under the common law and the Dirks case, the seller takes the risk that the buyer knows something he doesn't. As Judge Williams suggested, shareholders can't complain if they get more for their stock due to the serendipitous fact that an anonymous buyer had illicit information.    Our view has been that to date the only real victim of insider trading would be a company that hires an investment banker or lawyer whose misuse of confidential information causes the company to pay more for a target company. This is the precise issue framed by Litton's ongoing case against Shearson Lehman, arising from its acquisition of Itek.    The courts have experience in separating the harmful from the harmless. In time the common law will clarify insider-trading law. Meantime, the cost of uncertainty grows with each new lawsuit. </TEXT></DOC>
