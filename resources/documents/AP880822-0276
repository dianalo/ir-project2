Parties ranging from other financial institutions to collectionagencies and ``vulture funds'' are likely to join in the bidding onOct. 20, according Joel D. Zegart, president of JBS andamp; AssociatesInc., which will conduct the open-outcry auction in a ballroom at adowntown hotel.   The loans, which include commercial, real estate, energy andpersonal loans, are among $5.2 billion in Continental Bank loansthe FDIC purchased for $3.5 billion as part of its $4.5 billionplan to save the bank from failure.   Continental, acting as the FDIC's administrator, has collectedon or disposed of problem loans with a face value of more than $3.7billion since the federal rescue, said Jerry Lemmons, a member ofthe bank team in charge of the effort.   The FDIC will assume sole responsiblity for disposing of anyloans that are not sold or collected on by Nov. 1, Lemmons said.   Chicago-based JBS pioneered the auction approach to loan sales,holding the first such event last October when it generated about$2.7 million from the sale of $8 million worth of loans made by twofailed central Illinois banks, Zegart said.   The FDIC and Continental opted for the public-auction routeafter a failed offering of $1.2 billion worth of the problem loans.None of the sealed bids received for that package met the minimumprice set by the agency.   ``The biggest advantage is that (the public auction) provides asense of confirmation for buyers,'' Zegart said. ``It provides anopportunity for them to be in an open forum and see how their peergroup values certain assets.''   Prices paid at similar, though smaller, JBS loan auctions rangedfrom a penny per dollar of face value for the most hopelesslyuncollectable loans to 95 cents on the dollar, he said.   The worst-case loans, called ``charge-off'' loans because theyare regarded by the seller as not worth the cost of collecting,typically are purchased for pennies on the dollar by collectionagencies and investment pools called ``vulture funds,'' theofficials said.   Loans with a better chance of being repaid may be bought bythrifts, savings and loans or sophisticated investment groups thatare prepared to work out payment schedules or take the debtor tocourt, Zegart said.   Lemmons said the package of Continental Bank loans being readiedfor auction would be ``heavily skewed'' toward charge-off loans.</TEXT></DOC>
