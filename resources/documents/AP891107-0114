(Laughter).   Where did someone else go wrong?   We've been trying to cooperate in a bipartisan fashion. I don'tthink _ I don't _ I'm _ look, if I make a big mistake, I'll admitit. But I don't think so when it comes to the approach to thebudget. We've got some honest differences on some things, and maybewith George Mitchell, there's an honest difference on capitalgains, for example. But we put that in our budget proposal. It wasin there with a certain revenue figure next to it. I don't think I``went wrong.'' That's my responsibility.   Here's what I believe. And I think that there has been a littlebit of a partisan shift that occurred up there. When you hear themall come out with a rather unflattering word on the same day todescribe my leadership, you begin to wonder _ including thenational chairman of the Democratic Party _ you begin to wonderwhat goes awry. But let's leave aside the politics. I'll be ready,come the fall of 1990, and let's move the legislative processforward.   Q: This was supposed to be groundwork for cooperation nextyear's budget, which was going to be the real tough one. Have welost all hope of that now?   A: Well, I think a lot on '91 depends on what happens, you know,in the last few days here; what kinds of decisions are made.   Q: Staying on the budget for a minute, the Pentagon feels itcan't live with the consequences of a sequester apparently, andyou've issued a statement last week saying that you're prepared tomanage the government under those circumstances. As a person whocampaigned as a candidate who would defend the Pentagon and keepdefenses strong, how do you explain this to the people whosupported you on the basis of. ...   A: I tell them please get in touch with the Congress and do whatwe suggested back there when we had that _ those meetings. Pleasehelp us keep the defenses of this country strong, but if the _ ifthat is frustrated by the inability to get an acceptablereconciliation bill, I have no choice, and I think the Pentagonleaders understand that.   We _ Dick Cheney has done a superb job. He has fought withdiminishing resources for a sound Pentagon budget. And it troublesme to have Congress insensitive, and also to add in _ I mean, it'stough _ look, I know it's tough to cut systems. But you go to cutthem, and Cheney makes some very tough decisions backed by thepresident, and then the Congress trades around and adds them backin. And so it's a question of, you know, staying with what we findis the priority for this defense program and trying to stay withit. But, I've got to live with the system also.   Q: Mr. President, in the back.   Q: Are you willing to meet with Prime Minister Shamir when hecomes to Washington?   A: Uhhh, whether he's coming or not, I'm not sure. Certainlywilling to consider it. And he is giving _ I think there's a realeffort now to work out support for the Baker points _ the Bakerproposals _ and I'd like to feel that a meeting would be held andthat it would be constructive, that we'd have something positive totalk about.   Yes?   Q: Mr. President _ Mr. President, last week, you said inresponse to the Nicaraguan decision to end the cease-fire, that youwould keep your options open. And yet, the best headcounters _ infact, most of the worst headcounters on the Hill _ all say youdon't have the option of new military aid to the Contras. So, isn'tthat, in effect, a meaningless statement?   A: Well, I'll tell you _ no, because I think one option now isto encourage in every way we can these talks that will result in acease-fire. I worry about what Ortega has done. The only good thingabout it _ everybody sees that he is _ he is swimming against thetide, and I think that it's much clearer to some who, in ourhemisphere, who are inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt.But, I'm not going to give up on hoping that they can get back tothe status quo ante here.   Q: But, you don't believe, sir, that you still have the optionof renewing military aid to the Contras, do you?   MORE</TEXT></DOC>
