But these officials said Bush has decided for the time beingagainst recommending any hike in the $89,500 salary received bymembers of Congress, and will recommend no change in the widelycriticized system that permits lawmakers to earn thousands ofdollars in speaking fees.   Bush, who promised during last year's campaign to crack down onethical laxness in government, arranged to lay out hisrecommendations in a speech at the American Society of NewspaperEditors convention.   Among the recommendations is one extending the one-year ban thatcurrently prohibits executive branch employees from lobbying theirformer office to have it apply to members of Congress and tojudges, said a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   In making his proposals, Bush is expected to accept most of therecommendations made by a special commission he established, anddiscard some others.   The commission that Bush set up to recommend changes for anethics overhaul had called for a ban on honoraria to members ofCongress for speaking engagements or similar work. Such honorariaprovide thousands of dollars in outside income for senators andrepresentatives in a system that critics, including Bush's ethicspanel, contend allows for too much special interest influence onthe representatives.   But the president decided that the issue of honoraria should beconsidered in conjunction with the question of a congressional payraise, separate from the ethics package he was preparing to putforward Wednesday, said the official who spoke anonymously.   Bush's proposal is expected to cover matters such as outsideincome, conflicts of interest, financial disclosure, enforcementand restrictions on what executive branch employees can do afterthey leave the government.   His announcement follows the March 10 report by his eight-memberethics commission, which detailed 27 recommendations for changes inethics laws and regulations as they apply to senior officials,judges and members of Congress and their staffs.   In addition to proposals that require congressional legislation,Bush will issue an executive order covering executive branchemployees, the administration sources said.   The order will include provisions to give elevated rank to adesignated ethics officer in each department, and will do away with``compartmentalization'' of the various agencies of the executivebranch for purposes of lobbying after working for the government.   The current one-year lobbying ban for executive branch workerswould remain but would be extended to cover all agencies ratherthan just the one in which the individual was employed.   For instance, a former employee of the vice president's staffwould be precluded not only from lobbying that office but also anyother executive branch agency, such as the Office of Management andBudget.   Bush's Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform, in its March 10recommendations, reiterated Bush's campaign pledge to seek the sameethical standards for the judicial and legislative branches ofgovernment that apply to the executive branch.   The panel recommended a ban on honoraria for all three branches.   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, withoutspecifically confirming that Bush had dropped the honorariaprovision for members of Congress, said Tuesday that the presidentbelieves the matter should be discussed in conjunction withcongressional pay raises.   ``We have always said that honoraria are a part of the payequation and we do not intend to deal with the congressional payraise, so it makes sense we wouldn't deal with the other part ofit,'' Fitzwater told reporters.   Bush does intend to ``work with Congress'' to come up with a payraise coupled with a resolution on the honoraria question, said anadministration source who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Bush backed previous pay raise legislation, but Congress itselfvoted against giving its members a raise earlier this year.   ``The subject of honoraria is inherently attached to pay raises.He'd like to work with the Congress separately on it rather thancramming the honoraria ban down their throat,'' the source said.   Bush's executive order also bars senior government officialsfrom serving on the boards of profit-making enterprises, an areathat caused complications for his own White House counsel, C.Boyden Gray.   Gray voluntarily stepped down as chairman of a family-ownedcommunications company after it was revealed that he continued tohold the post in contradiction to Bush's planned ethics guidelines.   Bush's reported decision on the honoraria question broughtimmediate criticism from Fred Wertheimer, president of theorganization Common Cause, which backs a congressional pay raiseand wants to do away with all honoraria.   He said Bush's proposal undermines the president's avowed effortto set stricter ethical standards for government.   ``It appears he has caved in to pressure by members of Congresswho want to keep this corrupt system going. He knows better and itappears the president doesn't have the courage of his convictions.''</TEXT></DOC>
