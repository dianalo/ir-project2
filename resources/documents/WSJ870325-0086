Last week, the British government proposed ending tax breaks that let banks recover withholding tax paid on foreign loans. Some countries require foreign creditors to pay withholding tax, normally about 15%, on interest earned from local borrowers.    Banks in Britain long have been able to deduct a large part of these foreign withholding taxes from their total British corporate-tax liability. The Conservative government now wants banks' foreign-tax credit to come from a much smaller pie: their tax liability on profits from each foreign loan.    The measure, which Parliament likely will approve, would affect new loans made after April 1 and all existing loans after April 1, 1988.    British and international banks here can renegotiate most international loan agreements if a change in tax law affects a loan. That's why the tax proposal is forcing many banks to examine their loan portfolios. It isn't clear how many foreign borrowers would face stiffer loan terms if the proposal becomes law.    &quot;The measure will hurt banks, exporters and borrowers,&quot; said a loan officer at one large British merchant bank. &quot;The only one to gain will be the Inland Revenue.&quot; The Inland Revenue is the government's tax collectors.    But banks may leave certain loans alone. In hard-pressed Brazil, for example, &quot;the idea of negotiating loans upward is fairly bleak,&quot; said a tax expert at another British merchant bank.    Inland Revenue expects the measure to boost tax revenue by about $32 million in the year ending March 31, l989, and $97 million the next year.    Without the present foreign-tax credit, many international loans would fail to cover banks' funding costs and overhead, some bankers warn. Worst off could be &quot;tax-spared&quot; loans. With such loans, a bank recovers its foreign withholding taxes in Britain even if a borrower's country forgives the tax -- a break meant to subsidize loans to developing countries.    Bankers worry that the tax measure would make them lose the most money on tax-spared loans, increasing pressure to renegotiate the loans at higher interest rates.    The proposal also would affect foreign banks with branches and subsidiaries based in Britain because they, too, have booked international loans here to take advantage of the tax break.    ---   Standard Chartered PLC   LONDON -- Standard Chartered PLC said lower taxes caused 1986 net income to rise 11%, to the equivalent of $253.7 million from $229 million in 1985.    But Britain's fifth-largest commercial bank was dogged by loans to National Bank of Brunei, which was closed by Brunei authorities last November, and by an expensive but successful defense against a takeover by Lloyds Bank PLC. Standard Chartered said it spent $11.1 million to defend against the Lloyds bid.    Provisions for bad and doubtful debts rose to $296.5 million -- including $114.8 million for the Asia-Pacific region -- from $162 million in 1985.    Standard Chartered declined to disclose what portion of its debt provisions are related to its loans outstanding of about $37.4 million to National Bank of Brunei. In November, more than 70% of the bank was owned by the family of Malaysian financier Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat.    Tan Sri Khoo was one of three investors who separately bought large stakes in Standard Chartered, thereby helping it to thwart last year's hostile takeover bid from Lloyds Bank. He still owns 6.2% of Standard Chartered's shares. </TEXT></DOC>
