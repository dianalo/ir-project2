Fine said police and military forces using such things as teargas or guns loaded with rubber bullets should be made aware of theirpotential danger.   ``It really is important for police and military personnel to geta better understanding for the medical consequences so that they beused with more caution, more restraint, and in some cases be totallybanned,'' he said.   ``Tear gas is a misnomer, if ever there was one. It's actuallypoison gas,'' Fine said.   Effects of tear gas were documented from observations of theeffects of tear gas used to control student demonstrators in SouthKorea in June 1987, Fine said. While the common symptoms of crying,coughing and nausea subside within a few hours, people living nearareas frequently gassed reported getting ``tear gas cold,'' apersistent cough and sore throat for several weeks, he said.   While police and government officials say crowd control methodsare vital to maintaining public security, Fine said the Physiciansfor Human Rights believe the instruments used should be carefullyexamined and their use should be limited.   Other health care professionals at the seminar reported resultsof a February trip to Israel observing casualties on the West Bankand Gaza Strip.   Jennifer Leaning, director of emergency services for the HarvardHealth Plan, said that of 103 injured people interviewed, 72 percenthad been injured within 24 hours of the interview. While gunshotwounds accounted for 5 percent of the recently injured, theremainder were due to rubber bullets, tear gas and clubs, she said.   Many of the beating wounds were broken bones in the arm or hand.   Leaning said the Israeli government cooperated with thephysicians' visit, but the team had difficulty interviewing injuredIsraeli soldiers and spoke mainly with Palestinians. After the teamreported its findings, the Israeli government responded mainly bypointing to an improved infant mortality rate on the West Bank andGaza.   Velvl Greene, a professor of epidemiology at Ben GurionUniversity in Beer Sheva, Israel, said the reports of injuriessuffered by Palestinians on the West Bank were biased because theydidn't take into account injuries inflicted by Palestinians.   ``They're not demonstrations, they're attacks,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
