The sanctions were included in a compromise version of atwo-year, $9.7 billion bill authorizing activities of the StateDepartment and related federal agencies. The measure now goes backto the full House and Senate for final approval.   The measure contained harsh rhetoric condemning the ``unprovoked,brutal and indiscriminate assault'' on the thousands ofpro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing on June 4, noting that atleast 700 people died and another 27 or more were executed afterward.   The bill also condemned China's efforts to conceal the truth ofwhat happened, including clandestinely disposing of bodies andsuppressing news reports.   But its strongest section was a set of trade sanctions, includingsuspension of insurance trough the Overseas Private Investment Corp.for companies doing business in China; suspension of tradeassistance; a freeze on exports of satellites; a halt to sales ofcontrolled munitions, including helicopters and parts, and crimecontrol equipment; and an end to sale of certain nuclear materialand components.   The sanctions go beyond penalties imposed earlier in the year byBush and the measure was initially opposed by the White House. Butit was later accepted after Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman ofthe House Foreign Affairs Asia subcommittee, agreed to make iteasier for the president to waive the sanctions.   In discussions with National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft,Solarz said, the measure was altered to allow termination of thesanctions if the president certifies such action is ``in thenational interest.'' Scowcroft reported that the president would notveto the measure based on that provision, said Solarz.   As the conferees worked through a list of disagreements betweenthe House and Senate bills, they also accepted a section that wouldimpose criminal penalties on any government official who enlists anyforeign government to carry out policies that are banned by U.S. law.   The amendment was intended to bar use of U.S. foreign aid asleverage on recipient countries to support goals that the UnitedStates cannot pursue directly because of legal restrictions. It isaimed at situations like the use of U.S. military aid for Hondurasto pressure that government to support the Contra rebels fightingthe leftist governnment in neighboring Nicaragua.   That provision, which stemmed from Congress' discoveries duringthe Iran-Contra affair, could still provide a reason for Bush toveto the bill.   The overall measure included $4.7 billion for the StateDepartment and other agencies for the current fiscal year, whichbegan Oct. 1, and $5 billion for next year.   It includes major boosts in aid for the United Nations and forU.N. peacekeeping forces.   They would be authorized to receive a total of $832 million thisyear and $939 million next year, compared with $520 million lastyear.   The National Endowment for Democracy, which promotes democraticelections abroad, could get up to $25 million in each of the twoyears, compared with $15 million last year.</TEXT></DOC>
