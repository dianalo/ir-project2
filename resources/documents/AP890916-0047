(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former PTL board members testified in JimBakker's fraud trial that they didn't know the company wasstruggling to pay its bills when they approved of big bonuses forthe evangelist and his wife.   Prosecutors accuse Bakker of diverting more than $3.7 million inPTL money to fund his lavish lifestyle. If found guilty of the 24counts against him, Bakker could be sentenced to 120 years in prisonand fined more than $5 million.   Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye, received more than $3 million inbonuses from the ministry in the mid-1980s, according to evidencepresented in the trial. The bonuses often came during periods offinancial trouble for the ministry, witnesses have testified.   Board members testified Friday they were kept in the dark aboutthe financial condition of the ministry. Bakker and his formerdeputy Richard Dortch are accused of concealing PTL's deterioratingfinances from the PTL directors.   The Rev. Evelyn Spencer, a board member from Oakland, Calif.,said she trusted Bakker to inform board members of the ministry'sfinances. ``I just trusted him, period,'' she said.   Aimme Cortese, a New York City minister and PTL board membertestified that she never would have voted for the bonuses had sheknown about PTL's financial condition. ``It didn't make sense,'' shesaid. ``How could you give away bonuses while you were floating(checks)?''   A former PTL payroll clerk testified that 265 ministry workerswere laid off in November 1985, a month during which the Bakkersreceived $300,000 in bonuses.   Joanie Ames, a single mother of two, said she called her childrentogether and said, ``I'm sorry to tell you this, but we won't haveChristmas until after because the check won't be here.'''   The prosecution has said that Bakker received a $200,000 bonus onNov. 12, 1985, and Mrs. Bakker got a $100,000 bonus. Less than ayear later, on Nov. 3, 1986, the PTL board approved a $500,000 bonusfor Bakker.   Also Friday, a former PTL attorney testified that he advisedDortch that the ministry should fight Jessica Hahn's threatenedlawsuit over a sexual encounter she had with Bakker.   Los Angeles attorney Scott Furstman testified that he consideredHahn's threatened suit frivolous.   But Dortch decided to pay Hahn $265,000 because he feareddisclosure of the 1980 encounter, Furstman said.   A deal finally struck between Dortch and Ms. Hahn included a$115,000 payment to Ms. Hahn, and $150,000 put into a trust accountfor her. The trust was never set up, but the money was deposited ina money market account.   The trust fund money eventually was returned to the trustee inPTL's bankruptcy proceedings in July 1988.   The federal charges against Bakker cite the Ms. Hahn payoff moneyas an example of how he allegedly used PTL money for his personalbenefit.</TEXT></DOC>
