This is the dilemma faced by the creators of Thunder II, a majorupgrade of the popular Thunder! program from Electronic Arts.andM;But MacWrite II does not have a glossary function.andP;  Thunder II does.andO;WriteNow can't check for spelling errors as you type.andP;  Thunder II can.andP;  ActaAdvantage has no spelling checker at all.andP;  Thunder II can give it one,Thunder II can also eliminate the need to maintain separate dictionaries foreach application that uses a spelling checker.andP;  So there are some compellingreasons to get a stand-alone spelling checker, and Thunder II should be thefirst one you consider.andP;  It remains a standard for combining useful featureswith ease of use.andM;WHAT IT IS The most obvious difference between Thunder II and its earlierversions is that it's now a cdev/INIT rather than a DA, so Thunder II isautomatically launched at staff up.andP;  You select the dictionaries to be loadedand the applications with which Thunder II should run from the Control Panel.andO;From then on, Thunder II opens automatically, adding its own menu to the menubar whenever a designated application is launched and making it appear to beintegrated into each application.andM;Thunder II operates in either Interactive or Check Selection mode.andP;  When usedinteractively, it checks your typing and beeps whenever it detects a mistake.andO;With a minimum number of keystrokes, it then suggests corrections andcorrects mistakes.andP;  It automatically backspaces to the error, no matter howmuch more you've typed, makes the correction, and retums the cursor to itsoriginal position.andP;  Thunder II checks for four separate categories of eff ors(spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and double-word errors) and can beset to make a different beep sound for each type of error.andP;  But be carefulnot to use Thunder II's interactive mode when a program's built-ininteractive spelling checker is also on because your system will almostcertainly crash.andM;The Check Selection mode operates similarly, but the checking is done all atonce when you've finished typing.andP;  In this mode, you can also generatestatistics about the selection, including a word count and the level oflinguistic complexity of the selected passage.andP;  Iii earlier versions ofThunder!, font and style formats were often lost when changes were pastedback into a document.andP;  Thunder II now includes numerous applicationspecific&quot;compatibility modules&quot; (such as for Word and WriteNow) that solve thisproblem.andP;  Thunder II doesn't work with everything, but it comes close.andM;HOW IT WORKS Thunder 11 doesn't stop with the basics.andP;  With its editableglossary dictionary, often-used phrases can be abbreviated and stored forrecall with just a few keystrokes (NYT for New York Times, for example).andO;Special glossary functions can even paste in the current time and date.andP;  Youcan also create a special search-and-replace list to make a series ofreplacements in one quick pass through your finished document.andP;  When you'readding new words to a dictionary, Thunder II provides an extensive checklistof variants on the word (such as the plural, past-tense, and possessiveforms) to be added.andP;  Finally, Thunder II is fast; suggested alternatives popup as fast as, or faster than, with any other spelling checker I've used, andreplacements are made virtually instantaneously.andP;  Despite all these features,Thunder II remains a space saver - the program and dictionaries combined takeup only 340K.andM;Thunder II has no significant drawbacks.andP;  My only minor criticism is that itdoes not automatically provide an editable display of a misspelled word.andP;  Ifyou wish to make a correction other than using an alternative it suggests,you have to reenter the word completely.andM;If you're satisfied with your word processor's built-in spelling checker andhave little need for one in other applications, then Thunder II is probablyan unnecessary luxury; otherwise, it is an excellent value.andM;- Ted LandauandM;Thunder II **** 1/2andM;List Price: $79.95andM;Published by: Electronic Arts, 1820 Gateway Drive, San Mateo, CA 94404; (415)571-7171.andM;Version:1.0andM;Requires: System 5.0 or later.andP;  Compatibility: All Macs with 1 megabyte.andM;Application Size: Program, 162K; large dictionary, 175K.andM;Copy Protection: None</TEXT></DOC>
