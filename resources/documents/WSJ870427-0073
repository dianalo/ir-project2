Pound and Andy PasztorStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDEST LATAMAEROSPACE (ARO)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Congressional committees are exploring whether as much as $10 million in profits generated by secret U.S. arms sales to Iran went to middleman Albert Hakim or some of his associates, according to sources familiar with the inquiry.    Secret bank records turned over last week in Paris to House and Senate panels by Mr. Hakim show that he took large sums from the Iranian arms transactions, the sources said. But, they added, the committees haven't determined what Mr. Hakim ultimately did with the funds, or whether anyone else may have profited.    What is clear, the sources said, is that the Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras benefited far less from the arms sales than Attorney General Edwin Meese and others previously suspected. Mr. Meese has estimated as much as $30 million may have been diverted to the Contra resupply program, but information gathered by the committees suggests that the total may range between $4 million and $12 million.    Sources familiar with the committees' work stress that these are preliminary estimates that need refinement. However, lawmakers, federal law-enforcement officials and others familiar with the flow of funds from the arms sales agreed that the issue of profits has become an increasingly important element of the continuing investigations.    Without naming individuals, members of the committees have indicated that some middlemen probably pocketed profits either from the arms sales to Iran or in the resupply effort for the Contras. &quot;We wouldn't be surprised if profits were made,&quot; said Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.), chairman of the House committee. But, he stressed, such profits wouldn't &quot;necessarily be illegal.&quot;    Such profits would be illegal only if investigators determine that the funds handled by Mr. Hakim belong to the U.S. government.    One problem in tracing how much money was used to help the Contras is that, instead of receiving cash, funds were used to provide the rebels with supplies and to finance the aerial resupply operation, according to two sources familiar with the congressional inquiry.    Mr. Hakim, an Iranian who is a naturalized U.S. citizen, handled financial arrangements for the private network that first assisted the Contras and later became involved in the U.S. arms sales to Iran. He turned over Swiss bank records and other documents to Congress under a grant of limited immunity that protects him from being prosecuted on the basis of material derived from the documents or his testimony. His business partner, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, is negotiating with the committees about testifying. Mr. Hakim hasn't been available for comment since the Iran-Contra scandal erupted last November.    Friends of Gen. Secord say that he didn't profit from his involvement in the affair. However, congressional and criminal investigators are reviewing his financial records and want to question him about, among other things, whether he profited from his activities.    The records provided by Mr. Hakim also show that Saudi Arabian officials donated about $30 million to the Contra cause, according to one source. The money was donated during a period, beginning Oct. 1, 1984, when Congress outlawed U.S. assistance to the rebel movement.    Furthermore, according to the source, the committees haven't been able to determine what happened to a $10 million donation to the Contra cause from the Sultan of Brunei. Mr. Hakim's records don't indicate whether any of those funds reached the Contras, the source said, and the committees haven't obtained records showing how the money was used.    Meanwhile, law-enforcement officials acknowledge that Lt. Col. Oliver North, after expressing interest in a politically sensitive criminal probe of alleged arms smuggling to the Contras, received information in early 1986 about the status of the case through Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters. The FBI previously denied that headquarters officials passed on such information to Col. North, a former White House aide and main figure in the Iran-Contra operations.    Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel investigating the Iran-Contra affair, wants to determine whether Col. North tried to obstruct the criminal investigation handled by the U.S. attorney in Miami. A grand jury in Miami began hearing evidence in the gun-running case late last year. Mr. Walsh's investigators recently found a copy of a memo about the gun-running case addressed to Col. North and others in the files of the U.S. Attorney's office.    More generally, Mr. Walsh wants to determine the extent and nature of any contacts between Col. North and the FBI. In that regard, officials said Mr. Walsh has been told that the bureau supplied either Col. North or other White House aides with information about a number of other pending criminal cases. But investigators and law-enforcement officials declined to elaborate. </TEXT></DOC>
