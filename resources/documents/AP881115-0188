U.S. officials said the administration has proposed thesession be held over lunch on Dec. 7 at New York's MetropolitanMuseum of Art.   Reagan said the meeting, in which President-elect George Bushwill participate, will not be in the nature of a summit. But mindfulof Gorbachev's escalation of the agenda at their meeting in Icelandtwo years ago, he said, ``We'll just have to see what comes up.''   At the session, Reagan plans to seek Soviet confirmation that thefour-part agenda for superpower relations, which included armscontrol and human rights, would be carried over to the Bushadministration, said U.S. officials.   The two other agenda items for the four Reagan-Gorbachev summitmeetings as well as the talks Secretary of State George P. Shultzheld with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze wereregional conflicts, such as the war in Afghanistan, and U.S.-Sovietbilateral problems.   Reagan is likely to seek a reaffirmation from Gorbachev of aSoviet pledge to withdraw all Soviet troops from Afghanistan by Feb.15, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The plans for the meeting at the Manhattan art museum have notyet been approved by Moscow, the officials said.   They stressed they did not expect Reagan and Gorbachev tocomplete a new treaty scaling back U.S. and Soviet strategic nuclearweapons. That will be left for the Bush administration to pursue,the officials said.   The meeting is to be held in conjunction with a speech byGorbachev to the U.N. General Assembly. Bush, who takes office Jan.20, is already committed to pursuing a summit with Gorbachev nextyear.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the agenda had notbeen set. Shultz plans to fly immediately after the Gorbachevsession to a meeting with the foreign ministers of the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels Dec. 8-9.   Gorbachev proposed the meeting with Reagan and Bush throughSoviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin. The envoy delivered a note toShultz on Sunday from Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, aU.S. official said.   The president told reporters he anticipated ``a briefget-together'' with the Soviet leader. They have held four summitsin the last three years and improved superpower relations. Theprincipal achievement was the treaty Reagan and Gorbachev signedlast December in Washington to abolish U.S. and Sovietintermediate-range nuclear weapons.   Reagan, asked about seeing Gorbachev again, said ``that's notgoing to be anything in the nature of a summit meeting.'' Heacknowledged, however, that he had ``no way of speculating'' whatproposals the Soviet leader might offer.   Other U.S. officials said the agenda would be worked out indiplomatic exchanges between Washington and Moscow. ``Likewise, thenature of the meeting,'' said State Department spokesman Charles E.Redman.   Before Reagan and Gorbachev met in Reykjavik, the capital ofIceland, in October 1986, U.S. officials had limited expectations oftheir agenda. But the two leaders proceeded to reach tentativejudgments about wide-ranging reductions in their nuclear arsenals.The summit broke up in a disagreement over Reagan's anti-missileStrategic Defense Initiative.   Asked if the New York meeting could develop the same way, Reaganreplied: ``That depends on whether you are going by the publicversion of Reykjavik or what actually happened there.''   He did not elaborate and reporters quizzing Reagan while he posedfor pictures with visiting West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl wenton to other questions.   Bush has already said he did not need a get-acquainted meetingwith Gorbachev, having met him during the Soviet leader's visit toWashington. The president-elect has said he would like to hold asummit meeting provided it held out promise of progress in any oneof several areas, including arms control and human rights.   But first, Bush said, he would have James A. Baker III, hischoice for secretary of state, meet with Soviet Foreign MinisterEduard A. Shevardnadze and with NATO foreign ministers.   ``What I want to see is progress,'' Bush said last Wednesday.``I've never supported meetings just for the sake of havingmeetings.''   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimovdescribed the meeting as part of ``a continuation of the U.S.-Sovietpolitical dialogue that we believe should continue withoutartificial pause.''   At the White House, Fitzwater said the main purpose from the U.S.standpoint was to ``ensure that the momentum and continuity of thearms control talks are extended and it will reaffirm therelationship between the general secretary and the new president ofthe United States.''   ``I would not look to it as a meeting that would be settlingthings,'' he said.   Several major issues in the U.S.-Soviet relationship are on thebrink of resolution.   These include a treaty that would reduce by 30 to 50 percent U.S.and Soviet long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines, andarrangements for the withdrawal of more than 50,000 Cuban troopsfrom Angola.   Also, the Soviets two weeks ago announced a suspension of theirtroop withdrawal from Afghanistan, while the two sides aremaneuvering for position on a Soviet drive to hold a conference inMoscow on human rights.   Announcing Gorbachev's visit, the Soviet news agency Tass said hewould travel also to Britain and Cuba and set forth Soviet views onproblems of world development in his speech to the United Nations.   Reagan first met with Gorbachev in Geneva, Switzerland, inNovember 1985. They held their second summit in 1986 in Reykjavik,then met in Washington last December and in Moscow May 29-June 2.   At the end of the Moscow summit, Reagan said the two leaders hadestablished so deep a relationship they could get together anddiscuss world problems ``without the necessity of a plannedagreement,'' Fitzwater said.   He said the New York meeting, their last, ``will reflect thatrelationship.''   Moreover, the spokesman said, ``this brief meeting will helpsmooth the transition from president to president-elect. It willensure that the moment and continuity of the arms control talks areextended. It will reaffirm the relations between the generalsecretary and the new president of the united states as we enter thedecade of the '90s.''</TEXT></DOC>
