My husband and I have flownmany frequent-flier miles with Pan Am World Pass. We are flying to Moscow inAugust on World Pass.;    I just could not let that article stand withoutsaying that we have never encountered any problems getting an award trip fromPan Am. The World Pass agents are the best and will do everything they can tobe accommodating. From their pleasant voices to their wealth of knowledge,they make it easy for us World Pass travelers. We have never been turned downfor a flight, unless it is a blackout date, of which they have few.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Travel  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HIGH-FLYING FREQUENT-FLIERA SATISFIED CUSTOMER SPEAKS UP FOR HER FAVORITEAIRLINE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Travelers' Exchange  </MEMO><TEXT>     Please publish this, so that frequent fliers know that Pan Am World Pass isfirst class.; Charles and Shirley Odom; Santa Clara;  MORE TIPS ON PRAGUE;HAVING recently returned from Eastern Europe, I was interested in comparing myexperiences with those of Zeke Wigglesworth. Judging from the timing of thearticles, we must have crossed paths! I want to point out an error in theMercury News article on Prague (Prague Spring, June 2, Travel section) and addsome of my experiences:;    (check) In the &quot;If You Go . . . &quot; sidebar, youstate that the crown is not convertible outside Czechoslovakia. This is nolonger true, though it takes a little searching. We were able to convertleftover crowns at large banks in Vienna, Austria. The same was true for theHungarian forint.;    (check) Crystal glassware is a fantastic shoppingbargain in Prague.;    (check) The wary traveler should be sure to make dinnerand brunch reservations, especially on the weekends. Given all the tourists,Prague has a severe restaurant capacity problem. We had to suffice with snacksfor dinner one Saturday night as all of the restaurants were full.;    (check)Any guidebook written before 1989 will not be much help with regard topractical information. So much has changed, including re-naming streets, thatour initial guidebook was virtually useless. We purchased a better(English-language) guidebook from a sidewalk vendor in Prague.; Marc E. Kenig; Mountain View;  What about the U.S.?; COULD you explain to me why, with theeconomy in the shape it's in, you persist in touting trips to places outsidethe continental United States? The United States is one of the more beautifulcountries in the world, and also one of the more interesting. Can't youfeature locations your readers can drive to?;    Frankly, I'm getting tired ofseeing stories about Tonga (who cares about going to Tonga except you, Mr.Wigglesworth?) when I am willing to bet 80 percent of your readers don't havean inkling of ever visiting such out-of-the-beaten-path locales. (It Takes Twoto Tonga, April 14, Travel section).;    How about some stories about theUnited States and maybe even British Columbia? Try throwing in a story or twoabout Alaska. Our national parks and monuments deserve some recognition fromour citizens, and you have the forum to provide that attention.; PeterChiappetta; Soquel  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910707  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2T  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  530  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday July 7, 199100189024,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
