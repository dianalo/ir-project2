<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-69-0461 </DOCNO><TEXT>The radiolytic products of the peptides, gly-L-leu and L-leu-gly in 2mM aqueous solution in the presence of air were examined by gamma-irradiation(6, 12 and 25 kGy). Peptides in aqueous solution were exposed to gamma-radiationand then analysed by HPLC and amino acid analysis. In each case, peptidesdecreased with an increasing gamma-ray dose. The radiolytic productsfrom gly-L-leu were gly, leu, ammonia, glycinamide, methylamine, ser,gly-gly and gly-ser (estimated). The products from L-leu-gly were observedto be leu, gly, ammonia, leu-cinamide, methylamine, ser and ser-gly (estimated).The formation of ammonia from both peptides increased with a correspondingincrease in gamma-irradiation. Amide formation was small and increasedonly slight with an increase in gamma-ray dose (Fig. 3). However, itwas not confirmed that this could be correlated to the distruction ofpeptides and the formation of amino acids by an increase in the gamma-raydose (Fig. 1 and 2). From these results, a radiolytic pathway of gly-L-leuand L-leu-gly was estimated. From the observation of amide formationfrom peptides by gamma-irradiation, we inferred that amide formationcould similarly occur in proteins subject to gamma-irradiation.</TEXT></DOC>
