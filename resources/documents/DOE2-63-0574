DNA hyperploidy (greater than 5 C) was observed in 16 (21.6%)of 74 workers who had been exposed compared with 15 (3.5%) of 430 workerswho had not (p less than 0.001). The prevalence of DNA hyperploidy increasedin a dose-response manner from 3.5% to 60% with increasing duration ofexposure. The association between DNA hyperploidy and exposure persistedwhen adjustment was made for age and cigarette smoking (p = 0.0001).The prevalence of the marker was greatest for exposed workers who smoked(23%), and lowest for those who had no exposure and who had not smoked(2%). This study indicates that DNA hyperploidy can serve as a markerfor identifying workers who are at increased risk in occupational groupsexposed to bladder carcinogens.</TEXT></DOC>
