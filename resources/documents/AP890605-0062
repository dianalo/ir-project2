Eight policemen were reported wounded and 48 people detained inthe Fergana Valley region in a rampage sparked by clashes betweenmembers of the Uzbek majority and an ethnic Turk minority.   The rioting in the Central Asian republic, about 1,500 milessoutheast of Moscow began as the Soviet Union's latest ethnicviolence, but it was fueled by chronic unemployment in the regionand soon turned into ``vicious clashes between thousands of furiouspeople,'' Soviet television reported.   Soviet Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin told the nightlytelevision news program Vremya: ``This outburst has been provokedby somebody. So far I can't say by whom. But it's clear that someevil forces are involved who think that the worse things are, thebetter.''   Bakatin, interviewed in Uzbekistan, warned that 6,000 InteriorMinistry troops were brought in Sunday night after a curfew wasimposed on the troubled areas and more were on the way, so ``wehave enough force to resist hooligans and extremists.   ``Let no one think they can give us ultimatums,'' he said.``Ultimatums will not succeed here.''   Vremya showed smoking hulks of houses and cars, the remains ofSunday night's violence. It said ``armed extremists in cars and onmotorcycles'' would ``appear and disappear unexpectedly,'' injuringpeople and torching buildings.   The Soviet Congress on Monday issued an appeal calling upon``those involved in ethnic clashes to turn to the voice of reasonand stop the bloodshed.'' President Mikhail S. Gorbachev read italoud and it was broadcast live to the nation as part of theCongress' proceedings.   ``Think about all the innocents who are threatened _ women,children and old people. And stop, prevent injustice from beingcommitted,'' it said.   The spiritual leader of Central Asia's millions of Moslems,Mufti Mahammadsadyk Mamayusupov, also appealed for calm.   In Margelan, one of the towns in the region, party leadersretreated into their headquarters behind the protection of a ringof soldiers instead of trying to hold a dialogue with protesters,Vremya said.   It complimented the Interior Ministry troops for ``behaving verydelicately'' in a complex situation, apparently meaning they hadcaused no injuries.   No units of the Red Army have been brought in to bolster policeand internal forces, Tass said. Army troops were last used tohandle Soviet ethnic unrest in Georgia, where their April 9 clashwith protesters left at least 19 dead.   The last report of fatalities in an ethnic disturbance inCentral Asia occurred in December 1986, when the Kazakhstan capitalof Alma Ata was rocked by rioting touched off when the localCommunist Party leader, a Kazakh, was replaced by an ethnicRussian. Two people were killed in the first major outbreak ofethnic violence since Gorbachev's rise to power in March 1985.   Gorbachev's policies of greater openness and more tolerance ofdissent have been followed by outbursts of ethnic and nationalistunrest in several of the Soviet Union's 15 republics and among itsscores of ethnic groups.</TEXT></DOC>
