(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Here is a text of Lithuanian PresidentVytautus Landsbergis' statement late Wednesday. It was issued inLithuanian and translated for The Associated Press by Lithuanianofficials.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   This order, like any other adopted by a foreign state thatpretends to claim sovereignty over Lithuania, has no legal power.It could be enforced only by brutal military force, and if theSoviet Union is willing to prolong the aggression of 1940 againstLithuania. It's a pity that it continues the mistake of the ThirdCongress of People's Deputies.   It amounts to the claiming of non-existent and unjustifiedsovereignty of a powerful country over a small and unarmedneighbor. The Soviet Union has recognized as null and void thesecret protocol to the agreement between Stalin and Hitler,condemned the policy of ultimatums and violation of internationallaw including the annexation of Lithuania, but now once again isnot able to give up the prize and restore justice.   The ghost of Stalinism is walking in the Kremlin and the shadowof it lies far to the west (over Lithuania). Tomorrow will show ifthe world, which greets Lithuania and her desire for freedom, willapprove. We'll meet tomorrow, serene and united as we were beforefacing previous threats.</TEXT></DOC>
