There also is considerable reluctance to get too complacent untilspecifics of Bush's program are known.   On Bush's first trip outside the United States since hisinauguration, he promised Friday to move quickly with congressionallegislation to control acid rain.   He also said after his meetings with Prime Minister BrianMulroney that the United States would move toward discussions withCanada for an accord on the controversial issue.   ``The president's comments on the subject mark a small stepforward in the longstanding environmental dispute between the twocountries,'' The Globe and Mail newspaper wrote Saturday.   ``However, without an exact U.S. timetable for the discussions,or commitments on the amount or timing of any cuts on transborderair pollution, Canada may still have to wait years before there istangible relief on the issue,'' the Toronto daily wrote infront-page coverage of the visit.   Canadian concern about the acid rain, blamed for killing some14,000 lakes in the eastern part of the country and defoliatingmillions of acres of forests, has been a dominant issue in relationswith the United States for the past decade.   One of Bush's two official visits to Canada as vice president wasin January 1987, when he came to Ottawa to hear Mulroney'scomplaints that the United States was holding back on acid raincleanup.   Frustration grew in Canada during the eight years of the Reaganadministration, when the pomp of summit meetings produced virtuallyno results on the issue.   For example, the Reagan administration did not once proposelegislation to strengthen the U.S. federal Clean Air Act.   More than half the acid rain in eastern Canada comes from theUnited States, and in some areas U.S. emissions of sulphur dioxideand other materials cause 70 percent of acid fallout, according tothe Canadian government.   The program to control Canadian emissions takes full effect in1994.   ``I think Mr. Bush's approach is a 180-degree reversal in U.S.policy,'' said Michael Perley of the Canadian Coalition on Acid Rainlobbying group.   He told reporters that while Reagan did not even recognize acidrain as a problem, the situation now is that ``we've got the rightprinciple, the right approach.''   Perley also said the specific amount of emissions to be cut andthe timetable for doing so are critical.   Senior Canadian diplomatic officials, speaking on condition theynot be further identified, said they understand Bush's need tooutline the specifics to Congress first.   At a joint news conference with Bush, Mulroney said thepresident's position ``represents quite substantial progress. Youknow, it wasn't so long ago that Canada was sort of going it alonein many ways in this area.''   Bush said he assured Mulroney ``that the time for just pure studywas over and that we've now approached the time for legislativeaction.''   The United States apparently would be willing to start talks forthe bilateral agreement Canada long has sought on acid rain afterthe legislation is moving forward, possibly as early as this year.   Environmental concerns ran strong among Canadian voters polledduring the campaign last fall that returned Mulroney's ProgressiveConservative Party for a second consecutive majority government.   Indeed, Barbara Bush was reminded by a reporter as she toured theNational Gallery of Canada that lakes portrayed in the paintings shewas seeing were endangered by acid rain.</TEXT></DOC>
