Gold prices rose in Zurich.   Dealers said there continues to be little market-affecting news,other than Monday's 47.34-point drop in the Dow Jones industrialaverage.   ``The market is essentially stable,'' said one trader in Rome.   ``There are no signs of a resumption of any movement'' in themain currencies, he said.   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business daybegins, the dollar rose 0.18 yen to a closing 143.63 yen. Later, inLondon, it was quoted at 143.45 yen.   The Bank of Japan reportedly sold dollars for yen during theEast Asian day when the dollar approached the psychologicallyimportant 144.00-yen barrier. Traders said the move limited thedollar's upward potential, but did not raise fears of another roundof concerted central bank intervention.
