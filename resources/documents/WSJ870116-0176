Among Common Market members, only France and Britain have insider-trading laws. But they could be joined by the 10 other EC countries if the commission's proposed directive becomes EC law.    The proposal, which is expected to be published later this month, would create an EC-wide ban on insider trading. It also would suggest how EC authorities might cooperate to prevent the practice, according to Geoffrey Fitchew, the commission's director general for financial services and company law.    The insider-trading proposal is one of several initiatives the commission is undertaking as part of a broader effort to create uniform rules for the European financial-services industry.    Separately, in London, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said it is &quot;too soon&quot; for Britain to consider altering its self-regulatory approach to securities regulation.    In Parliament, Mrs. Thatcher urged opposition politicians to be patient about the government's widening inquiry into Guinness PLC's possible illegal manipulation of its own shares.    &quot;It's far too early to go from present self-regulation to conclude that we should go to a full statutory system,&quot; she said, according to a British Press Association report.    Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock and other party members in Parliament asked the ruling Conservative Party to strengthen the powers of the Securities and Investments Board, an industry watchdog created last year. Currently, the panel can't initiate criminal action against wrongdoers. </TEXT></DOC>
