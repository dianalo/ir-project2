Priorities CFDA No. 84.023C_Field-Initiated Research This priority provides support for a broad range of field-initiated researchprojects focusing on the education of, and early intervention servicesfor infants, toddlers, children, and youth with handicaps consistent withthe purposes of the program as stated in 34 CFR 324.1. This priority allowsprojects to address problems identified by researchers/investigators inthe field. CFDA No. 84.023B_Student-Initiated Research This priority provides support for a broad range of student initiated projectsfocusing on the education of, and early intervention services for infants,toddlers, children, and youth with handicaps consistent with the purposesof the program as stated in 34 CFR 324.1. The Secretary particularly encourages applications for short term projects(up to 18 months) that will develop research skills in post-secondary students.The Secretary further encourages applications that, while developed bythe student, will identify a principal investigator who will serve as amentor to the student/researcher. However, in accordance with 34 CFR 75.105(c)(1),applications that meet the criteria discussed in this paragraph will notbe given a competitive or absolute preference over other applications.CFDA No. 84.023A_Small Grants Program This priority provides support for a broad range of research projects thatcan be completed within a 12-18 month time period, are budgeted at $75,000or less for the entire project period, and are focused on the educationof infants, toddlers, children, and youth with handicaps consistent withthe purpose of the program as stated in 34 CFR 324.1. This priority isfor pilot studies, projects that employ new methodologies, descriptivestudies, instrument validation studies, projects that synthesize state-of-the-artresearch and practice, projects for research dissemination and utilization,and projects that analyze extant data bases. CFDA No. 84.023D_Research on General Education Social Studies or LanguageArts Curricula The purpose of this priority is to support projects that analyze generaleducation kindergarten through grade eight curricula in (1) social studiesor (2) language arts using a cross-grade (e.g., primary, elementary andmiddle grades) perspective to determine the compatibility of the scope,sequence, and presentation (including rate, complexity, informational density,and approach for organizing and presenting content) with the learning characteristicsand needs of students with handicapping conditions for whom the regulareducation curriculum is considered appropriate. In planning the research,projects must consider the kindergarten through grade eight curriculumin social studies and language arts as a whole, not just as a year-by-yeartreatment, so that assumptions about students' prior knowledge and skillsas well as their need for acquisition, mastery, automaticity, applicationof skills, and understanding of concepts can be examined. While focusingon the needs of children with handicaps, projects must consider currentnational initiatives in social studies or language arts including thoseof professional associations and the Federal Government to develop standardsand new curricula for use in regular primary, elementary and middle schoolgrades. Alternative curriculum approaches to organizing disciplinary knowledgebases in social studies or language arts curriculum design must be included,and their implications for educating children with handicaps in kindergartenthrough grade eight examined. For example, in social studies such alternativeapproaches might include social studies as process for conveying facts,events, and historical trends; social studies as a process for teachingvalues (e.g., citizenship, capitalism, democracy); social studies as ameans to teach general social science principles (e.g., the tenets of economics)rather than details related to historical events (e.g., the Great Depression);social studies as a process for teaching problem solving skills by emphasizingcause-effect relationships; or social studies as a process for reflectiveinquiry. In language arts, these alternative approaches might include languagearts as a process for teaching language skills and knowledge for the purposeof transmitting the culture; language arts as a means for teaching skillsthat have utilitarian value in our society; or language arts as a meansfor enhancing the cognitive development of students (by giving studentstools to access, process, and interpret information). These alternative approaches for organizing social studies or languagearts curricula will provide the starting point for analyzing alternativestructures for prioritizing, segmenting and arranging social studies orlanguage arts content to be covered in kindergarten through grade eight.In addition, potential alternatives for structuring this content must beexamined. These analyses must include examination of current curriculascope and sequence, textbooks and supplementary materials. Finally, thestructural alternatives for presenting social studies or language artscontent for kindergarten through grade eight must be examined in relationto the learning characteristics of children with a variety of handicaps,particularly related to needs associated with acquisition, mastery, automaticity,application of skills, and understanding of concepts. The purpose of thisactivity is to develop guidelines for decision-making related to determiningappropriateness of, establishing priorities for, and adapting or modifying,curriculum goals and objectives for children and youth with handicappingconditions. These guidelines must make explicit the factors to be consideredin making these decisions. Further, the guidelines must be useful to publishersfor textbook revision activities, to teachers for analyzing and prioritizingcontent for students, and to school district personnel who conduct schoolbuilding or district-wide curriculum revision activities and textbook evaluationand adoption procedures.To determine the usefulness of the guidelines, projects must include severalfield tests. These field tests must determine: (1) The usefulness of theguidelines to publishers in the development of new materials and in therevision of existing materials; (2) the extent to which the guidelineshelp teachers analyze and prioritize content for students; and (3) theutility of the guidelines in improving school building or district-widecurriculum revision and textbook evaluation and adoption procedures. Partof the field testing must include obtaining informed judgments about thelogic, design, and content of the guidelines from each of the target audiencesabove. For purposes (2) and (3), the projects must also include field testsin at least four school districts to test the usefulness of the guidelinesas implemented in typical settings (classrooms and districts). The targetpopulations for this priority are primary, elementary, and middle schoolaged students (kindergarten through grade eight) with handicapping conditions.It is anticipated that two cooperative agreements will be funded underthis priority: one addressing social studies curricula and one addressinglanguage arts curricula. CFDA No. 84.023H_Research on the Delivery of Services to Students WithHandicaps From Non-Standard English, Limited English Proficiency (IncludingMono-Lingual) and/or Non-Dominant Cultural Groups The purpose of this priority is to support projects that focus on studentswith handicaps from non-standard English-speaking, limited English proficiency(including mono-lingual), and/or non-dominant cultural groups. Projectssupported under this priority must: (1) Use ethnographic and observationalresearch techniques to identify the cultural and language features of classroomsand related service settings (e.g., speech or occupational therapy providedelsewhere on school grounds) that detrimentally affect the delivery ofeducational services to students with handicaps from non-standard English-speaking,limited English proficiency (including mono-lingual), and/or non-dominantcultural groups by general education, special education, and related servicespersonnel; (2) develop and test strategies, including personnel trainingstrategies, for adapting the delivery of educational services to betteraccommodate the cultural and language patterns of these students; and (3)develop and test strategies for enhancing the development of the language,social, and survival skills necessary for functioning and learning in specialand regular educational and community settings by students with handicapsfrom non-standard English-speaking, limited English proficiency (includingmono-lingual) and/or non-dominant cultural groups. Projects may selectone or more target groups for the research but must make the selectionthrough consideration of research evidence showing the need to addressthe particular groups. CFDA No. 84.023K_Interventions to Support Junior High School-Aged StudentsWith Handicaps Who Are at Risk for Dropping Out of School This priority supports research projects that focus on junior high school-agedstudents who are classified as seriously emotionally disturbed (SED) andstudents who are classified as learning disabled (LD), and who are at riskfor leaving school prior to completion. These projects must develop andfield test interventions designed to enhance students' engagement in school.Each project must identify a target school district in light of relevantdistrict and student characteristics including the percentage of nonhandicappedstudents and the percentage of students with handicaps, by handicappingcondition, who exit schooling by dropping out. Information and hypothesesas to the reasons district students classified as SED and students classifiedas LD drop out of school must also be considered along with strategiesfor keeping these students in school. Hypotheses must be based on a conceptualframework that is drawn from previous special education and general educationresearch regarding school drop-outs and drop-out prevention but tailoredto the particular characteristics and circumstances of the target districtand its students. This framework must identify school, home, and communityfactors that result in student engagement in schooling. Indicators of studentengagement in schooling include attendance, participation in school andextra-curricular activities, completion of assignments, development offriendships, as well as commitment to school completion as measured bycontinuance in schooling during the entire project period. The interventionsmust address underlying problems rather than correct symptoms associatedwith students who drop out of school. For example, failing grades may beassociated with students who drop out, but to simply give passing gradesto students at risk for dropping out is not an acceptable intervention.Projects must develop, implement, and test comprehensive interventionsrelated to these factors. School-based components of interventions mustbe implemented in general education settings, though they may be implementedin alternative school settings if these settings include nonhandicappedstudents. Projects must select at least two cohorts of students in successiveyears and follow them through at least two years of participation in theinterventions through their transition to high school and at least to achronological age that is 6 months past the minimum age for exiting fromcompulsory schooling as determined by State law or regulations. Researchfindings from the first cohort of students must be used to adjust (if necessary)the interventions used with the second cohort. In designing the field tests,investigators must concurrently or retrospectively collect informationon comparison cohorts of similar students within the district to providea longitudinal data base for measuring the effectiveness of the interventions.The final (fifth) year's activities must be limited to student follow-upand dissemination of project findings and materials, and thus will entaila reduced level of funding. Each project supported under this prioritymust include both SED and LD students at risk for dropping out of school.CFDA 84.023N_Initial Career Awards This priority provides awards to eligible applicants for the support ofindividuals who have exited from graduate school programs no longer thanthree years prior to the award to conduct research and related activitiesfocusing on the education of infants, toddlers, children, and youth withhandicaps consistent with the purpose of the program as stated in 34 CFR324.1. The support is intended to allow individuals in the initial phasesof careers to initiate and develop promising lines of research that willimprove the education of children with handicaps. The project must includea potential contribution to be derived from the proposed line of inquirythat will be pursued during the project period.

Priorities: CFDA No. 84.024B_Nondirected Demonstrations This priority supports demonstration projects that develop, implement,and evaluate new or improved approaches for serving young children withhandicaps (ages birth through eight). Projects funded under this prioritymust design models that allow young children with handicaps to achievetheir optimal functioning level within normalized, nonsegregated environments.Projects must (1) address a specific service problem or issue; (2) includespecific components or procedures of the model and the rationale, basedon theory, research, or practice evaluation, for those components or procedures;(3) include specific types of students to participate in the project (i.e.,by age, handicapping condition or diagnosis, level of functioning) and(4) include an evaluation design that includes functional outcome measuresfor the young children with handicaps who participate in the proposed interventions.Final reports submitted by projects funded under this priority must includeboth the specific findings of the project as well as general principlesthat have been learned or tested for developing interventions for youngchildren with handicaps. Quantifiable information from project evaluationactivities must also be included along with precise information regardingthe procedures for the interventions and the contexts in which they wereimplemented as well as available cost information. The Secretary particularly invites applications for demonstration projectsthat develop models for delivering, coordinating, or supplementing neededdevelopmental, special educational, or related services to infants, toddlers,or preschool-aged children with handicaps who are in day-care programs(home-based, center-based, or home or center based in conjunction withpart-day special education preschool programs). This invitational priorityresponds to the growing number of young children, including children withhandicaps, who are placed in day-care services to accommodate the childcareneeds of working parents. However, in accordance with EDGAR at 34 CFR 75.105(c)(1),an application that meets this invitational priority receives no competitiveor absolute preference over other applications for demonstration projectsthat develop, implement, and evaluate new or improved approaches for servingyoung children with handicaps (ages birth through eight). CFDA No. 84.024M_Information Management of Services for Infants and ToddlersThis priority supports demonstration projects to develop or improve andevaluate automated information management systems for tracking, managing,and planning services for young children with handicaps, aged birth throughtwo years of age, and their families within a State or major urban area.The system must (1) separately track and count the children and familieswho receive early intervention services; (2) identify the types and locationof those services provided and/or needed but not provided; (3) identifythe provider and the funding sources (Federal, State, private, or local)for each service provided; (4) alert programs serving preschool-aged childrenof incoming three year old children, at least three months in advance ofthe children's transition from early intervention services to preschoolservices; and, (5) use data elements compatible with State or regionalchild count systems. Projects must coordinate the program with the State education agency andthe State agency designated to administer the Program for Infants and ToddlersWith Handicaps in the States where the information system is tested. Thesystem must be coordinated with any other information systems in the State(e.g., health agency systems for tracking specific medical conditions),that overlap in population tracked, intent or purpose. This may be achieved,for example, by using identifiers compatible with other existing systems,or by merging the existing systems into a single system. Projects funded under this priority must include an evaluation design thatassures that the automated system is operational (<T3>i.e. </T3>produces information and reports that are accurate and consistentwith the system design), that the required information linkages are compatibleand reliable, and that the information produced is useful for trackingand planning purposes by the intended users of the information system.It is anticipated that projects funded under this priority will developthe software, documentation, and users' guides that will allow other interestedagencies to adopt the information system. Users guides must provide asmuch information as possible as to the ways elements of the system canbe adapted to fit the data needs or hardware configurations of other agencies.CFDA No. 84.024D_State or Multi-State Outreach Projects This priority supports projects that facilitate the implementation in singleor multiple States of proven infant, toddler or early childhood models,or selected components of those models. Projects supported under this prioritymust: (1) Coordinate their dissemination and replication activities with thelead agency for Part H of the Education of the Handicapped Act for earlyintervention services or the State educational agency for special educationand related services; (2) Disseminate and replicate proven models, or components of proven models,that provide services needed to assist young children, aged eight and belowto achieve the children's optimal functioning. Services at a minimum mustcontain the following components: (a) Approaches relevant to programming in regular settings including provisionfor skills necessary to function in integrated educational environments;(b) Team based programming that integrates the delivery of services thatincludes parents, teachers, therapists and other professional disciplines;(c) Effective involvement of families in the planning and delivery of services;and (d) Interagency coordination when multiple agencies are involved in theprovision of services to children; (3) Evaluate the dissemination and replication activities to determinetheir effectiveness including their impact on the provision of servicesto infants, toddlers, and young children with handicaps. The models or components of models must be state-of-the-art, providingprocedures and information that are not readily available to program siteswithin States where outreach is planned. The models or components of modelsmust be based on current theory and research, and must have unambiguousevaluation information regarding effectiveness. In addition, the projectmust be consistent with the provisions of Part B or Part H of the Educationof the Handicapped Act. Outreach activities may include, but not be limitedto: public awareness, product development and dissemination, site development,training and technical assistance. The projects may work with major earlychildhood associations, provider groups or agencies in disseminating andreplicating the proven models, or components of proven models. Projects under this priority must (1) include models or components of modelsselected for outreach activities and a rationale as to the importance ofthese models; (2) select a model based on unambiguous evidence as to itseffectiveness; (3) include specific dissemination and replication activities;and (4) have a rationale for those activities. Final reports submitted by projects funded under this priority must includeevaluation information as to the effectiveness of the model as implementedby replication sites. The Secretary particularly invites applications for outreach projects thatare based on models serving young children with severe disabilities, youngchildren with handicaps due to chronic health problems, or young childrenwith handicapping conditions who have been previously unserved or underserved.However, in accordance with EDGAR at 34 CFR 75.105(c)(1), an applicationthat meets this invitational priority receives no competitive or absolutepreference over other applications for outreach projects that serve otheryoung children with handicaps aged birth through eight.Selection Criteria: The Secretary uses the following criteria to evaluate an application. Themaximum score for all the criteria is 100 points. (a) Importance. (15 points) (1) The Secretary reviews each application to determine the extent to whichthe proposed project addresses concerns in light of the purposes of thispart.

Priorities CFDA No. 84.158N:_Training and Employment Models for Youth WithHandicaps This priority supports school and community-based model projects for youthwith handicaps to be prepared for and placed in competitive or supportedwork prior to leaving school. This priority responds to growing evidencethat youth with handicaps who exit from school may have difficulty obtainingcompetitive or supported employment despite the vocational programmingthat may have been offered in school. These students often remain at homefor several years before a placement can be found in a job training orsupported employment program. By providing employment experiences in settingswhere the requisite support services are provided by adult service agenciesor other public or private providers prior to exit from school, it is morelikely that a smooth transition can be made from school to work and adultlife. Projects funded under this priority must include models that emphasizethe following: (1) Collaboration with employers; (2) Measurement of employer and youth satisfaction; (3) Program evaluation with outcome measures to determine initial and continuingemployment status; (4) Working relationships between education agencies and supported andtransitional work efforts at the State and/or local level; and (5) Working partnerships with families that demonstrate a commitment tomaximizing independence. The goal of these models is to place youths with handicaps in competitiveor supported employment. Supported employment must include paid employmentin integrated work settings and ongoing support from adult service agenciesor other public or private services. Final reports submitted by projects funded under this priority must includeboth the specific findings of the project as well as general principlesthat have been learned or tested regarding the preparation of youth withhandicaps for competitive or supported employment upon leaving school.Quantifiable information from project evaluation activities must also beincluded along with precise information regarding the procedures used toimplement the model and the contexts in which the model was implemented.CFDA No. 84.158S_Family Networking This priority supports model demonstration projects that build on existingtransition planning processes to assist youth with handicaps and theirfamilies in identifying, accessing, and using formal and informal networksto obtain needed supports and services to maximize independence in adultlife. Projects under this priority must ensure that there is an existingplanning process in place that includes the student, his or her family,representatives from the school, and representatives from adult serviceagencies or other providers in planning for the transition of studentswho will be exceeding the maximum age for public school services. Models funded under this priority must assist youth with handicaps andtheir families in identifying the range of possible post-school optionsfor living, working, recreation, or post-secondary education, and assessingthe supports or services needed by the student to participate in differentPost-school options. Projects must develop strategies to assist youth withhandicaps and their families in identifying potential formal (service agencies,handicapped student services) and informal (extended family, friends) sourcesof services and supports and in learning to effectively access and usethese sources. Persistent barriers to obtaining needed supports or servicesmust also be identified and strategies developed and tested for overcomingthese barriers. Final reports submitted by projects funded under this priority must includeboth the specific findings of the project as well as general principlesthat have been learned or tested regarding the identification, access,and use of formal and informal networks by youth with handicaps and theirfamilies to obtain needed supports and services. Common barriers identifiedto accessing and using various sources for support and service should bedescribed along with any implications for policy makers or service providers.Quantifiable information from project evaluation activities must also beincluded along with precise information regarding the model procedures,the context in which it was implemented, and available cost information.Selection Criteria The Secretary uses the following criteria to evaluate an application fornew awards.

To assist potential applicantsthe Department has assembled the following most commonly asked questions.Q. CAN WE GET AN EXTENSION OF THE DEADLINE? A. No. A closing date may be changed only under extraordinary circumstances.Any change must be announced in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and apply to <T3>all </T3>applications. Waivers for individual applications <T3>cannot </T3>be granted, regardless of the circumstances. Q. HOW MANY COPIES OF THE APPLICATION SHOULD I SUBMIT AND MUST THEY BEBOUND? A. Current Government-wide policy is that only AN ORIGINAL AND TWO COPIESneed be submitted. The binding of applications is optional. At least onecopy should be left unbound to facilitate any necessary reproduction. Applicantsshould not use foldouts, photographs, or other materials that are hard-to-duplicate.Q. WE JUST MISSED THE DEADLINE FOR THE XXX COMPETITION. MAY WE SUBMIT UNDERANOTHER COMPETITION? A. Yes, but it may not be worth the postage. A properly prepared applicationshould meet the specifications of the competition to which it is submitted.Q. I'M NOT SURE WHICH COMPETITION IS MOST APPROPRIATE. WHAT SHOULD I DO?A. We are happy to discuss the questions with you and provide clarificationon the unique elements of the various competitions. Q. WILL YOU HELP US PREPARE OUR APPLICATION? A. We are happy to provide general program information. Clearly, it wouldnot be appropriate for staff to participate in the actual writing of anapplication, but we can respond to specific questions about applicationrequirements, evaluation criteria, and the priorities. Applicants shouldunderstand that this previous contact is not required nor does it guaranteethe success of an application. Q. WHEN WILL I FIND OUT IF I'M GOING TO BE FUNDED? A. You can expect to receive notification within 3 to 4 months of the applicationclosing date, depending on the number of applications received and thenumber of competitions with closing dates at about the same time. Q. ONCE MY APPLICATION HAS BEEN REVIEWED BY THE REVIEW PANEL, CAN YOU TELLME THE OUTCOME? A. No. Every year we are called by a number of applicants who have legitimatereasons for needing to know the outcome of the review prior to officialnotification. Some applicants need to make job decisions, some need tonotify a local school district, etc. Regardless of the reason, becausefinal funding decisions have not been made at that point, we cannot shareinformation about the review with <T3>anyone. </T3>Q. HOW LONG SHOULD AN APPLICATION BE? A. The Department of Education is making a concerted effort to reduce thevolume of paperwork in discretionary program applications. The scope andcomplexity of projects is too variable to establish firm limits on length.Your application should provide enough information to allow the reviewpanel to evaluate the significance of the project against the criteriaof the competition. Is helpful to include in the appendices such informationas: (1) Staff qualifications. These should be brief. They should include theperson's title and role in the proposed project and contain only informationrelevant to the proposed project. Qualification of consultants and advisorycouncil members should be provided and be similarly brief. (2) Assurance of participation of an agency other than the applicant ifsuch participation is critical to the project, including copies of evaluationinstruments proposed to be used in the project in instances where suchinstruments are not in general use. Q. HOW CAN I BE SURE THAT MY APPLICATION IS ASSIGNED TO THE CORRECT COMPETITION?A. Applicants should clearly indicate in Block 10 of the face page of theirapplication (Standard Form 424) the CFDA number and the title of the programpriority (e.g., 84.023) representing the competition in which the applicationshould be considered. If this information is not provided, your applicationmay inadvertently be assigned and reviewed under a different competitionfrom the one you intended. Q. WILL MY APPLICATION BE RETURNED IF I AM NOT FUNDED? A. We no longer return original copies of unsuccessful applications. Thus,applicants should retain at least one copy of the application. Copies ofreviewer comments will be mailed to applicants who are not successful.Q. HOW SHOULD MY APPLICATION BE ORGANIZED? A. The application narrative should be organized to follow the exact sequenceof the components in the selection criteria of the regulations pertainingto the specific program competition for which the application is prepared.In each instance, a table of contents and a one-page abstract summarizingthe objectives, activities, project participants, and expected outcomesof the proposed project should precede the application narrative. Q. IS TRAVEL ALLOWED UNDER THESE PROJECTS? A. Travel associated with carrying out the project is allowed (i.e. travelfor data collection, etc.). Because we may request the principal investigatoror director of funded projects to attend an annual meeting, you may alsowish to include a trip to Washington, D.C. in the travel budget. Travelto conferences is sometimes allowed when it is for purposes of dissemination.Q. IF MY APPLICATION RECEIVES A HIGH SCORE FROM THE REVIEWER DOES THATMEAN THAT I WILL RECEIVE FUNDING? A. No. It is often the case that the number of applications scored highlyby or approved by the reviewers exceeds the dollars available for fundingprojects under a particular competition. The order of selection, whichis based on the scores of the applications and other relevant factors,determines the applications that can be funded. Q. WHAT HAPPENS DURING NEGOTIATIONS? A. During negotiations technical and budget issues may be raised. Theseare issues that have been identified during panel and staff review andrequire clarification. Sometimes issues are stated as ``conditions.'' Theseare issues that have been identified as so critical that the award cannotbe made unless those conditions are met. Questions may also be raised about the proposed budget. Generally, theseissues are raised because there is inadequate justification or explanationof a particular budget item, or because the budget item seems unimportantto the successful completion of the project. If you are asked to make changesthat you feel could seriously affect the project's success, you may providereasons for not making the changes or provide alternative suggestions.Similarly, if proposed budget reductions will, in your opinion, seriouslyaffect the project activities, you may explain why and provide additionaljustification for the proposed expenses. An award cannot be made untilall negotiation issues have been resolved. Q. IF MY APPLICATION IS SUCCESSFUL CAN I ASSUME I WILL GET THE ESTIMATED/PROJECTEDBUDGET AMOUNTS IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS? A. No. The estimate for subsequent year project costs is helpful to usfor planning purposes but it in no way represents a commitment for a particularlevel of funding in subsequent years. Grantees having a multiyear projectwill be asked to submit a continuation application and a detailed budgetrequest prior to each year of the project.Q. WHAT IS A COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT AND HOW DOES IT DIFFER FROM A GRANT?A. A cooperative agreement is similar to a grant in that its principalpurpose is to provide assistance for a public purpose of support or stimulationas authorized by a Federal statute. A cooperative agreement differs froma grant because of the substantial involvement anticipated between theexecutive agency (in this case the Department of Education) and the recipientduring the performance of the contemplated activity. Q. IS THE PROCEDURE FOR APPLYING FOR A COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT DIFFERENTFROM THE PROCEDURE FOR APPLYING FOR A GRANT? A. No. If the Department of Education determines that a given award shouldbe made by cooperative agreement rather than a grant, the applicant willbe advised at the time of negotiation of any special procedures that mustbe followed. Q. HOW DO I PROVIDE AN ASSURANCE? A. Simply state in writing that you are meeting a prescribed requirement.Q. WHERE CAN COPIES OF THE <T4>FEDERAL REGISTER</T4>, PROGRAM REGULATIONS, AND FEDERAL STATUTES BEOBTAINED? A. Copies of these materials can usually be found at your local library.If not, they can be obtained from the Government Printing Office by writingto: Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington,DC 20402.

Note that the program narrative should encompass each program and eachfunction or activity for which funds are being requested. Relevant selectioncriteria (included in this package) should be carefully examined for criteriaupon which evaluation of an application will be made and the program narrativemust respond to such criteria under the related headings below. The programnarrative should begin with an overview statement (Abstract) of the majorpoints covered below. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Objectives and Need for This Assistance </ITAG>Describe the problem and demonstrate the need for assistance and statethe principal and subordinate objectives of the project. Supporting documentationor other testimonies from concerned interests other than the applicantmay be used. Any relevant data based on planning studies should be included or footnoted.Projects involving Demonstration/Service activities should present availabledata, or estimates for need in terms of number of handicapped children(by type of handicap and by type of service) in the geographic area involved.Projects involving Training should present available data, or estimates,for need in terms of number of personnel by position type (e.g., teachers,teacher-aides) by type of handicap to be served.

Outline a plan of action pertaining to the scope and detail of how theproposed work will be accomplished for each grant program, function oractivity provided in the budget. Cite factors which might accelerate ordecelerate the work and your reason for taking this approach as opposedto others. For example, an application for demonstration/service programs should describethe planned educational curriculum: the types of attainable accomplishmentsset for the children served; supplementary services including parent education;and the composition and responsibilities of an advisory council.  An application for a training program should describe the substantive contentand organization of the training program, including the roles or positionsfor which students are prepared, the tasks associated with such roles,the competencies that must be acquired; the program staffing; and the practicumfacilities including their use by students, accessibility to students andtheir staffing. b.
