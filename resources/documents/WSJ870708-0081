The award calls for the Iranian government to pay the contract drilling concern $68.5 million plus interest, which could run $46 million to $47 million, the spokesman said.    The Associated Press said the award was the largest to date.    Sedco, called Sedco Inc. before its 1984 acquisition by Schlumberger, had sued the Iranian government and state-owned oil company after that country's 1979 revolution. The company sought recovery of damages related to the expropriation of its rigs, warehouse inventory and a Sedco unit that was a joint venture with two Iranian organizations.    The tribunal is charged with arbitrating billions of dollars in claims filed by both U.S. and Iranian concerns arising from the revolution that ended with the ouster of the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.    The AP reported that Parviz Ansari, an Iranian who was one of three arbitrators on the panel hearing the case, refused to sign the award because he believed it was biased in favor of the U.S.; the award is still legal without his signature.    Each of the three tribunal panels includes an American, an Iranian and a member from a third country.    Including the Sedco decision, the tribunal has awarded about $990 million to American claimants and $60 million to Iran, the AP said. </TEXT></DOC>
