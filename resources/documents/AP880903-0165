But others argue the newly enacted truce will help bring an endto squabbles within the Arab-dominated Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries, enabling the oil cartel to strengthen its gripon world markets.   ``If OPEC is politically stronger than it was during the war,then its capacity for controlling oil prices will be strongeralso,'' said Pierre Terzian, editor of the Paris-based oilpublication, Petrostrategies.   This past week, Subroto, the secretary-general of the cartel,capped off a series of meetings with oil producers by visitingofficials in both Iran and Iraq. The aim of the meetings was to wincooperation in curbing production by OPEC members to bolstersagging prices.   Although the meetings produced no immediate results, Subrotopromised to continue his search for a solution to the cartel'soverproduction problems.   Terzian predicted prices would firm in the coming months in therange of $16 to $18 a barrel. OPEC's target price is pegged at $18a barrel, but prices on the spot market have been running $3 to $4below that level.   London oil consultant Paul McDonald, however, looks for pricesto slide in a market already awash in crude.   ``The pressure is going to be on Iran and Iraq to produce moreoil because they need more money,'' he said.   ``A cease-fire means increased oil production,'' said PeterGignoux, director of the international energy department at theShearson Lehman Hutton brokerage in London.   Iraq already plans to expand its export capacity with a newpipeline through Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea.   ``They're planning to export more oil,'' McDonald said.``They're not building the ... pipeline for fun. They're going touse it.''   A key to controlling any increased production, analysts said, isOPEC's ability to bring Iraq back into the fold of the 13-nationcartel.   Iraq has in the past ignored its OPEC production quota of 1.54million barrels a day, demanding a share equal to Iran's 2.37million barrels a day. Iraq pumps an estimated 2.8 million barrelsa day in defiance of the quotas, analysts say.   In his meetings, Subroto tried to persuade Iran to allow Iraq ahigher quota.   ``There's no longer any obstacle for Iraq to get back in thequota system,'' said Terzian.   Nick Antill, oil analyst with the London brokerage CountyNatWest, said, ``If Iraq can be reintegrated on quota parity withIran, there's no real reason why prices can't be manipulated up''to OPEC's $18 a barrel target.   The 8-year Persian Gulf war caused widespread damage to the twocountries' oil industries.   Petro-Logistics, a Geneva-based oil consulting firm, estimatedwar damage to Iraq's oil facilities at $8.5 billion and destructionto Iran's operations at $25 billion.   Both countries are turning out oil well under their pre-warhighs of about 6 million barrels a day for Iran in 1974 and 3.5million barrels a day for Iraq in 1979.   Petro-Logistics estimates Iran could boost production to 3.2million barrels a day in a year and to 4.2 million barrels in fiveyears. Iraq's output could climb to 3.7 million barrels a day bymid-1989 and 5 million barrels in 1993, it said.   During the war, Iraq, aided by money from its gulf neighbors,built pipelines through Saudi Arabia and Turkey to carry out itsexport oil, bypassing war-ravaged facilities on the gulf.   ``Iran is likely to face a much tougher task than Iraq inboosting its post-war output and production capacity,'' saidPetro-Logistics.   ``Some major onshore fields have been irreparably damaged overthe past 10 years due to mature age, neglect and war damage,'' itsaid.   ``They've probably lost billions of barrels of reserves,'' saidMcDonald.   Kharg Island, Iran's key tanker terminal in the Persian Gulf,was badly pounded by Iraq's powerful air force as were refiningfacilities and oilfields.   Indeed, Iran, which once exported refined oil products, wasforced to turn to other countries to meet its internal demand.   ``It's an oil-rich society that cannot refine its own internalneeds,'' said Gignoux.   With the war winding down, the two countries must decide whetherto restore their oil industries to their pre-war might.   ``If they want to go back to what they were, that will requirebillions and billions of dollars of investments in the comingyears,'' said Terzian.   ``They will have the financial ability,'' he said. ``They havethe technical ability. Foreign service companies are eager to getcontracts. ... There is a golden opportunity for them in Iran andIraq.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
