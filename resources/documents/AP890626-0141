The attorney also argued that the mother has suffered no directharm from the tape, which has been copied and widely circulated, andshown _ in edited form _ on television.   The hearing before U.S. District Judge G. Ernest Tidwell was on amotion by Lowe's attorneys to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Lena ArleneWilson, the Marietta woman who accused Lowe of seducing herthen-16-year-old daughter, Lena Jan Parsons, during the DemocraticNational Convention in Atlanta.   The suit, which says Lowe inflicted emotional harm on the mother,seeks unspecified damages.   According to the lawsuit, Lowe made the sexually explicit tape inhis hotel room while visiting Atlanta for the political conventionlast July. Henry said the ``totality of conduct by Mr. Loweconstitutes seduction.''   The videotape shows a man believed to be Lowe in a room with MissParsons and another woman. It shows the teen-ager having sex withthe woman, with the man heard and seen giving directions, but itdoes not show intercourse between the actor and Miss Parsons. Adifferent segment of the tape, apparently taken at a different time,shows the man having sex with others.   Tidwell heard 40 minutes of arguments Monday but did not indicatewhen he would rule.   Lowe, 25-year-old star of such films as ``St. Elmo's Fire'' and``About Last Night,'' did not attend the hearing.   Atlanta attorney Edgar Neely, representing Lowe, told the judgethat Georgia law, under which the suit was filed, says only acustodial parent has the right to take legal action on a matterconcerning a child.   Miss Parsons' parents have divorced in the past year and herfather was granted custody, Neely said.   Mrs. Wilson has not suffered direct harm as a result of thealleged encounter, Neely argued. ``Georgia has always been quitedefinite ... there must be direct impact on the person who iscontending (harm),'' he said.   Even if Lowe did make the tape involving Miss Parsons, it cannotbe shown that it directly had an impact on the mother, Neely said.   ``The plaintiffs have gone to great lengths (to show) they're notbringing this case on behalf of the young lady. They are bringing iton behalf of the mother,'' he said.   Mrs. Wilson's attorney, Hue Henry, said Miss Parsons was livingwith her mother at the time the videotape was made. He said the tapehas caused direct harm by humiliating the family and straining theparent-daughter relationship.   ``This is a case of wanton, willful, intentional misconduct,''Henry told the judge.</TEXT></DOC>
