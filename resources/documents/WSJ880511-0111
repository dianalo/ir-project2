Taylor (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> FIN BNK </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The American Association of Retired Persons launched a credit union to compete for the basic consumer banking business of its 29 million members.    The AARP Federal Credit Union, which opened yesterday, already is causing consternation among banks and thrifts because of the unprecedented scale of its competitive threat. &quot;It's a potentially very powerful, nationwide force,&quot; said Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association of America.    The new entry draws attention to the spectacular growth of credit unions' assets, averaging almost 20% a year since 1980. And its national scope is expected to increase pressure from other financial institutions to end the nonprofit credit unions' tax-free status.    The association isn't modest about its potential. One goal, AARP said, is to &quot;set the national standard for value in financial services.&quot;    For AARP members, the new credit union will cost just $5 to join and require only a $250 minimum deposit to open a savings account.    Yesterday, the organization was offering a 5.6% yield on money market savings and certificates of deposit yielding from 6.8% for six months to 7.7% for five years. Its Visa card annual membership fee is $10, with 14.9% annual interest on unpaid balances beyond a 25-day grace period.    Many financial institutions offer less favorable rates and conditions. Cyril Brickfield, chairman of the board of the AARP credit union, said he hoped the difference would pressure other institutions to offer all consumers a better deal. AARP's credit union would try to extend credit to older people based on their net worth; many such applicants are rejected by other financial institutions because they lack credit histories or are retired, Mr. Brickfield said.    AARP plans to expand its credit union membership gradually over a few years. The association's officials wouldn't say what their growth targets are, but less than 4% of the membership would have to sign up to provide a million members.    Credit unions have prospered in the 1980s while banks and savings institutions have struggled. A spokesman for the National Credit Union Administration, which regulates them, said federally chartered credit unions grew to about $105 billion in assets last year from $40 billion in assets in 1980. With state-chartered credit unions, the assets nationally total about $160 billion, he said.    To win a charter, credit unions have to prove financial viability, be controlled by volunteer directors, and serve people with a common bond. Critics complain that has been interpreted increasingly broadly by the regulators.    Edward Yingling, chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association, contends that Congress originally designed a tax exemption for credit unions that were &quot;very small institutions operated by part-time help.&quot; Credit unions have broken that mold, he asserted. The AARP organization, he said, &quot;shows that the credit union movement has evolved to the point where they can offer almost any product to almost anyone.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
