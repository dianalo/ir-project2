The 526 delegates to the council, called a shura, include Moslemguerrillas who have fought the Afghan and Soviet armies for adecade, ministers who served the former monarchy, scholars and otherexiles.   They are scheduled to meet for three days at a religious complexon the outskirts of Islamabad. Guerrillas with assault riflespatrolled the grounds Thursday and all cars were examined at thegate.   Insurgent leaders organized the council and gave it the specifictask of choosing an administration to oversee elections inguerrilla-controlled areas of Afghanistan and in the refugee campsPakistan and Iran.   More than 5 million Afghans, about one-third of the population,have fled to the two neighboring countries since the civil war beganafter a communist coup in April 1978. Most went to Pakistan.   Azim Nasser-Zia, a spokesman for the moderate National IslamicFront of Afghanistan, said he feared fundamentalists among the sevenmajor insurgent parties based in Pakistan would would resurrect anearlier guerrilla government they had controlled.   ``We don't want an extremist-dominated government ... becausethey won't do anything about an election,'' he said. ``We willboycott it if they insist on the revival of the Ahmed Shahgovernment.''   Ahmed Shah, a leader of one of the fundamentalist parties, was tohave been president of a provisional regime the guerrillas chose ayear ago, but it never became functional.   Nasser-Zia's party supports elections, which would be held oversix months and choose a parliament of 350 members. Millions ofballots have been printed.   The political strategy assumes the government in Kabul will fallsoon after the Soviet military withdrawal is completed next week.   Red Army soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to helpfight the Moslem insurgency and an estimated 115,000 were in thecountry when the withdrawal began May 15 under a U.N.-mediatedagreement. It is to be completed by Feb. 15.   Political leaders of the groups based in Pakistan and Iran, wherethe guerrilla alliance has eight parties, still were discussing aformula for representation on the eve of the shura.   Those based in Iran, predominantly Shiite Moslems like their hostcountry, were dissatisfied with 60 seats originally allotted by theSunni Moslems based in Pakistan, who claimed 420. The other 46places on the shura are reserved for Afghan exiles and ``goodMoslems'' who have stayed at home.   Afghanistan is more than 80 percent Sunni Moslem and about 17percent Shiite.   Qaribur Rehman Saeed, a spokesman for the Pakistan-basedalliance, said Thursday the coalition in Iran would be assigned 80seats but he could not predict how many would demand places at thecouncil.   ``We have problems, big problems,'' Saeed told reporters at themeeting site.   Years of quarreling among rebel groups made many Afghansskeptical that the the leaders can put their differences aside andreach consensus.   Witnesses said a rally of about 3,000 moderates in Peshawar, thePakistani frontier city where the seven-party alliance is based,ended violently Wednesday when fundamentalists threw bricks into thecrowd and attacked the stage area.   The rally was organized by Afghans who favor the return of formerKing Zahir Shah, who was deposed in 1973 and lives in Italy.   Whatever government the shura chooses, the real power will beheld by a supreme council of guerrilla leaders and their appointees,spokesman for the Pakistan-based parties said.   The groups based in Iran have not yet been included in thatcouncil and, since doing so would increase the fundamentalistinfluence ``this is a ... gamble for us and for everyone else,''said the moderate Nasser-Zia.</TEXT></DOC>
