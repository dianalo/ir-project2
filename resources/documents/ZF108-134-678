Part of the difficultycan be traced to the fact that every mid-range product IBMintroduced during the decade had a different operating system, andsome had more than one.andP;  DEC, on the other hand, offered a singleoperating system across its entire range.andP;  IBM, having learnedfrom this, is implementing the Systems Application Architecture(SAA) to link at least some of its incompatible ranges.andP;  Toprotect 370 system investments and profits during the 80s, IBMemployed two strategies, neither of which was very successful.andO;The first involved offering 370 architecture using minicomputertechnology and the second was to offer products vastly differentfrom the 370 to customers unlikely to invest in a mainframe.andP;  Thecompany is about to launch a state-of-the-art,reduced-instruction-set computer-based machine code-named Rios.andO;IBM must get this product right or face even greater competitionand greater loss of market share in the mid-range marketplace.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   International Business Machines Corp.
