 It's no secret that knowledgeable observers considerelectronic databases, both numeric and text, to be burdened by UFOs, orunidentified filed objects.andM;Obviously, what we call information is not necessarily knowledge.andP;  A plethoraof exponentially expanding databases has failed to deliver on the loudlytouted promise of our information age: Information equals knowledge thatprompts informed action.andM;Federal agencies are expending greater resources than ever before to acquiretext-based data, while at the same time seriously underutilizing that data.andO;The government itself estimates that more than 2.7 billion documents aregenerated in public- and private-sector offices each year.andP;  By the year 2000,experts predict, the number of text documents produced will double everythree years.andM;Correspondingly, a growing number of government agencies is discovering thatunless information is easily accessible and available, it is worthless andmight just as well not exist.andM;Text retrieval software historically has been based on two primary methods,key word search and full database scanning.andM;Key Word SearchingandM;Key word search systems identify the main subject or subjects of thesearched-for documents in combination with author, entry date and so on.andO;Once key words are selected for a document, they become part of a separatekey word file and are the only words the search program uses for finding agiven document.andM;A serious weakness of key word searching is that key word retrieval systemsrequire the searcher to use the established key words.andP;  If the key wordneeded for a particular search was not defined in advance and previouslyassigned to a specific database file, then the search cannot be conducted.andO;Many searchers may not be familiar with the rationale behind the existing keyword file, lessening their effective use of the system.andM;Boolean scanning amounts to the second generation in search technology.andP;  Thiselaborate query language, named for 19th century mathematician George Boole,can increase the accuracy of searches.andP;  But many searchers find it difficultto describe the information they are seeking in the required Booleanlanguage.andP;  Librarians and information specialists often are the onlypersonnel capable of conducting productive Boolean searches.andM;Text retrieval systems do not make it easy for searchers to use large textdatabases productively.andP;  But what if documents could be found by usingmeaningful concepts relating to the information in the documents?andP;  Thisconcept retrieval approach to finding text documents results in better, moreaccurate searches in less time.andP;  Concept retrieval relieves the searcher ofhaving to understand search principles and techniques before being able toconduct an accurate and thorough search.andM;Both key word and Boolean text retrieval systems search for documents bymatching words in the search tool to words in the text document.andP;  Thisapproach works, but as we have seen, not so well.andP;  Word matching is not whatwe mean by concept retrieval.andP;  Concept retrieval is a text retrieval toolmade up of a hierarchical outline, called a topic, that precisely defines theconcept the searcher is interested in.andP;  Concept topics form a tree-likeoutline of relevant search criteria.andP;  The searcher can conduct the searchusing an easy-to-understand, logical diagram with visual clues, rather than alinear string of words.andM;Concept topics related to the information in the filed documents can becreated when the software tool is installed in an existing database.andM;With some systems, concept retrieval topics are easy to create and can besaved, edited, added to or combined by searchers into more complex andpowerful search tools.andP;  Concept topics also can be used to search on-linedatabases.andM;Listing by RelevanceandM;Relevance is a measure of how much the selected documents in a databaseprovide the searcher with the information needed.andP;  When users select aparticular topic and begin searching the database, the concept retrievalsoftware calculates a document's relevance value in relation to that topicand lists the found documents in descending order of relevance to the topic.andM;Concept retrieval systems can retrieve a list of relevant documents from a10,000-document database in less than three seconds.andM;Systems also can let users add new documents to the database in real timewithout interfering with other users.andM;When considering acquisition of a concept retrieval system, evaluate itscompatibility with a variety of word processors, scanners and opticalcharacter readers.andP;  Will the system work with your relational databasemanagement system?andP;  Will it run on PCs, workstations, minicomputers andmainframes, either stand-alone or on a networked client-server configuration?andM;As standard text retrieval systems continue to make life difficult for endusers in need of specific text and documents, the promise of conceptretrieval is being realized by the Strategic Air Command (SAC).andM;Text databases at SAC contain more than 2 billion characters of informationin 12 different document types.andP;  A new document is entered into the systemevery 12 seconds.andP;  To increase the efficiency of searches and reduce the timeinvolved, SAC served as a test site for Topic, a concept retrieval systemfrom Verity Inc., Mountain View, Calif.andM;The topic system provides users with a baseline library of topics that can beexpanded by adding new topics or modifying existing ones.andP;  Each user of thesystem can have a private topic library.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
