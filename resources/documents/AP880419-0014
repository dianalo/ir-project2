Newspapers carried unconfirmed reports after Col. Chang Hsien-yivanished in mid-January that he worked for the U.S. CentralIntelligence Agency and might have turned over nuclear secrets tothe Americans.   Chang was a deputy director of the official Institute of NuclearEnergy Research. He disappeared while on leave from his post.   ``We immediately looked at this map, maybe he fell off acliff,'' said Liu Kuang-chi, secretary general of the governmentAtomic Energy Council, as he moved to an office wall map of Taiwanand traced a route along rugged interior roads.   But several local newspapers provided a different scenario forChang's disappearance, reporting that he was a CIA informant wholeft for the United States with details about a Taiwanese nuclearweapons program.   A U.S. State Department spokeswoman Phyllis E. Oakley said inWashington last month that the department had no comment on whetherChang was an informant for the United States.   In Taipei, David Hess, spokesman for the American Institute ofTaiwan, which oversees U.S. interests here, has told the governmentand local media the institute has no idea of what happened to Chang.   Taiwan officials have repeatedly denied plans to build a nuclearbomb. Communist China has said the production of atomic weapons byTaiwan would be reason to invade the island, which Beijing regardsas a renegade province.   Nevertheless, the uproar over Chang has increased anti-Americansentiment that already was brewing here because of Washington'stough trade talk with Taiwan, which last year had a record $16billion trade surplus with the United States.   Although the United States in 1979 broke diplomatic relationswith Taiwan and recognized the Communist China government,Washington remains the island's major trade partner and armssupplier. The American Institute of Taiwan serves as an operativediplomatic and commercial link in the absence of an embassy.   ``I get a lot of hot reaction from my students,'' said Su Chi, amember of the Institute of International Relations who also teachesat National Chengchi University. ``Until this point there's alwaysbeen a huge reservoir of good will toward the United States ... butI think the reservoir has cracked.''   The Taiwan media, which has given intense coverage to Chang'sdisappearance, also has criticized the United States.   A March 25 commentary in the mass-circulation China Times saidthat no matter what the motive, ``the act of stealing our defensesecrets has invaded our national sovereignty and respect to acertain degree. ... No one can interpret this as friendlybehavior.''   Taiwan officials now believe Chang is in Washington. They haveasked the United States for information about him but the Reaganadministration claims it does not know his whereabouts.   Deputy Foreign Minister John Chang recently said Taiwan cannotlodge a protest with the United States because ``we don't haveevidence showing U.S. government or CIA involvement.''   But Jaw Shau-kong, a maverick lawmaker from the governingNationalist Party, is demanding retaliatory action.   The government ``probably should expel some (U.S.) diplomatsfrom Taiwan, expel some CIA; it cannot keep silent,'' said Jaw, whoviews the United States as an imperialist nation.   Jaw said he fears Chang took important military secrets,possibly classified information about Taiwan's missile developmentprogram. Jaw added that he wonders if such material could fall intothe hands of Communist China.   Liu, the nuclear energy official, noted that many of Chang'sclassmates worked on missile and airplane projects at themilitary-run Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology.   The government maintains, however, Chang did not take anysensitive information from Chungshan. Liu believes the missingscientist did not have access to such secrets even though he knewof work done by the Nuclear Energy Research Center staff formilitary-related Chungshan projects.   Professor Su believes Chang's disappearance is unlikely to causea serious re-evaluation of Taiwanese-U.S. relations but couldeventually lead to public debate of the country's nuclear policy.   In early April, the mass-circulation United Daily News newspaperpublished a poll that indicated Taiwan was split over thedevelopment of nuclear weapons.   According to the survey, 35 percent of the 767 people polled bytelephone said Taiwan should make atomic bombs while 34 percentwere against such a policy. The poll, with a margin of error of 3.5percentage points, indicated most people believe Taiwan is capableof making the weapons.   Nearly three-fourths of the respondents said that if Taiwandeveloped nuclear weapons they should not be used against mainlandChina.</TEXT></DOC>
