The two countries are at the head of the pack, Poland inrecognizing the trade union movement Solidarity, Hungary in raisingliving standards and even permitting a stock exchange to operate.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in a speech last month inVienna, called on the Soviet Union to scrap the Brezhnev Doctrine.That is the principle that Moscow has the right to dispatch the RedArmy to protect an endangered Communist government in any EastEuropean country.   Baker's speech shows the Bush administration is not sure SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev is willing to accept radical changein Eastern Europe. The Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 andCzechoslovakia in 1968 were on Baker's mind.   But times and the Soviet leadership have changed. Gorbachev isdetermined to improve political and economic conditions at home. Hemay want to encourage similar reforms among the East Europeanallies.   Baker, who is starting to feel his way in foreign policy, wasimpressed by the reports of reform he received in Vienna from theforeign ministers of Poland and Hungary. The pace in Poland haspicked up since, and Bush is preparing to announce on Monday amajor program of economic benefits.   Looking for opportunities to make a difference, the presidentand the secretary of state hope to encourage further cautiousapplications of American capitalism and Western-styled democracy inEastern Europe.   It is a policy that is bound to play well in the United States.   One of every eight Americans has roots in Central and EasternEurope. In many cases, the ethnic and cultural affinity is strongafter the passage of two or three generations. Conservativesespecially would like to ``liberate'' Eastern Europe from what theycall the Soviet empire.   Symbols are important. A Bush trip after his summit meeting inJuly with the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan andWest Germany could enhance his political standing at home whileemboldening the East Europeans.   President Nixon visited Poland and Romania. President Carterwent to Poland. Otherwise, U.S. presidents have not been to the sixcountries _ Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romaniaand Bulgaria _ allied to the Soviet Union since World War II.   The trick in considering high-level political visits is toarrange them in a way that encourages change instead of appearingto endorse the local government.   Mark Palmer, the U.S. ambassador to Hungary, suggests one way isto be sure to meet with church and opposition figures as well asthe party leadership. That is what former Secretary of State GeorgeP. Shultz did in the Ukraine and in Soviet Georgia.   ``The peoples of Eastern and Central Europe want the kind ofpolitical institutions taken for granted in the West,'' Palmerwrote in a recent East-West Forum publication. ``Eastern Europeanswant newspapers that print news, not propaganda; trade unions thatrepresent workers, not a single political party; universities thatare free to develop ideas and innovation; and governments electedby the people.''   The American diplomat suggested a presidential visit to all sixcountries. He said the United States is probably more popular inEastern and Central Europe than in any other part of the world.   But, Palmer wrote: ``It is up to the peoples of the region toinsist upon progress toward pluralism and openness.''   The United States and other Western countries, the U.S.ambassador said, can play a broad and important secondary role withdiplomatic exchanges and clever private initiatives.   Among Palmer`s suggestions:   _Credits, from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bankand other institutions, that are tied to specific reforms,including sharp cutbacks in the role of ministries, the Communistparty and the government in the East European economies.   _Western investments that encourage a diversification ofmanufacturing and a greater emphasis on consumer goods,agricultural commodities and tourism.   _Expanded contact between Western and Eastern political partiesand trade unions.   _Sending 1,000 English teachers a year to high schools inCentral and Eastern Europe and admitting 2,000 students from thereto study annually in the West.   ``It is time,'' Palmer said, `'for the West to perceive thisregion as a new frontier, one in which a new level of effort andperseverance will yield substantial results in the long term.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Barry Schweid is head of the AP's StateDepartment staff.</TEXT></DOC>
