Results of various tests on pilot scale weresupplemented by operating data of a coal flotation unit. The utilizationof this flotation which is mostly single-staged and is only used in severalstages for particularly difficult applications ranges from classicaluse on coal and ores to industry minerals and a diversity of applicationsin environmental technique: here not only for selective separation ofcontamination components from waste water from industry and municipalities,but also for processing of contamination from earlier industrial activities.</TEXT></DOC>
