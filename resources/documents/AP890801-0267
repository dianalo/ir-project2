The Justice Department said Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,FBI Director William Sessions and Anton Valukas, U.S. attorney forthe northern district of Illinois, would hold an afternoon newsconference in Chicago Wednesday.   The Justice Department did not give the reason for the newsconference.   Two law enforcement sources in Washington and Chicago, who spokeon condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press the newsconference was being held to announce indictments stemming from thetwo-year investigation.   One of the sources said Wendy Gramm, chairwoman of the CommodityFutures Trading Commission, also would attend.   The Chicago Sun-Times reported Tuesday that several commoditiestraders who have agreed to plead guilty to crimes have beenbargaining for reduced civil penalties.   A lawyer was not identified told the newspaper said he and otherattorneys have been negotiating with the CFTC to try to minimizepenalties against their clients.   The commission, which regulates the exchanges, has the power topull trading licenses, levy fines and ban future participation inthe markets.   Eight to 15 traders have agreed to cooperate in the federalprobe of an estimated 50 to 100 traders engaging in allegedlycorrupt practices at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and theChicago Board of Trade, the newspaper reported Tuesday.   When charges against cooperating traders are announced, thecommission is expected to disclose administrative penalties, thenewspaper said.   Meanwhile, the Merc has brought its own charges against fourtraders in connection with yen-pit trades with an undercover FBIagent who was part of the federal probe, according to the WallStreet Journal.   The Merc charges represent the third of four possible levels ofrepercussions traders could face if found to have defraudedcustomers or been guilty of wrongdoing, according to one lawyer whospoke with The Associated Press.   The four are federal criminal prosecution, federaladministrative penalties, disciplinary action by the exchanges andconsequences from the National Futures Association, which registerscertain categories of traders and has its own rules and penaltiesfor violating them, the lawyer said.   ``Lawyers are calling it quadruple jeopardy,'' he said.   Merc spokesman Andrew Yemma declined to comment Tuesday on theWall Street Journal report, which said the Merc charges concernprearranged trading in yen-futures contracts expiring in Decemberand March.   ``It is our policy not to comment on an investigation ...(until) disciplinary action is taken,'' Yemma said.   The charges could result in fines and expulsion of traders, theJournal said. Administrative action by the CFTC is likely to besimilar, according to the Sun-Times.   Even traders who cooperate will lose their licenses but may bespared enormous fines, the Sun-Times said. Also, traders mightavoid long-term bans from participating in the markets bycooperating.   For traders who aren't cooperating with federal prosecutors,however, the trading commission plans to withhold charges untilafter trials end, the newspaper said.   Anyone convicted is expected to face maximum administrativepenalties, while anyone found innocent of criminal wrongdoing maystill be liable for civil action based on court testimony.   Prosecutors met with about 20 traders' lawyers late last week toopen the way to possible plea-bargain arrangements for clientsfacing indictment under the federal Racketeer Influenced andCorrupt Organizations act.   In the two-year futures probe, FBI agents infiltrated thetrading floors to gather evidence of suspected illegal practices.</TEXT></DOC>
