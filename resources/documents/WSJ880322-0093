Jesse Jackson.    More than any of his Democratic rivals, the black presidential candidate has challenged Israeli policy and touched a chord among families torn by the strife in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as Lebanon and the Iran-Iraq war. Gray-suited, Iraqi-born businessmen -- who backed Ronald Reagan four years ago -- contribute money. Lebanese, Palestinian and Yemeni immigrants -- the women a sea of white scarves -- fill the hall of the Islamic Center with the chant &quot;Run Jesse Run, Win Jesse Win.&quot;    It is an alliance with special significance for both partners. An estimated 250,000 persons of Arab descent are concentrated in metropolitan Detroit, offering a source of money and votes beyond the Rev. Jackson's core support among blacks. A strong turnout by Arab-Americans in Saturday's Democratic caucuses would demonstrate the community's increased political power, and those who support Mr. Jackson now see his cause as a step toward their larger goal of being heard on Mideast policy.    &quot;We don't think of him as a person, we think of him as an idea,&quot; says Rafeek Farah, a 41-year-old Palestinian physician whose suburban clinic bears the Red Crescent symbol of the medical unit he once served in Lebanon. &quot;There is an Arab expression: 'I am talking to you but what I really want is your neighbor to listen to what I am saying.'&quot;    Dearborn's streets, in the shadow of Ford Motor Co., are at the heart of the community. The auto industry drew Arab immigrants here, and the union hall and nearby Jerusalem and Beit Hanina clubs symbolize both the economic and nationalistic currents in the election.    An older generation, which grew up with the United Auto Workers, puts a priority on trade legislation championed by the union. Joseph Berry, 72, a Lebanese-American who is retired after a lifetime in the union, devotes himself to Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who has made trade the centerpiece of his campaign. &quot;I respect Jackson for his positions, but I have to think of the working people,&quot; Mr. Berry says. &quot;I worked for years in the shops. We're losing most of our jobs.&quot;    But younger workers, like Hussein Karkaba, 35, a Lebanese immigrant who is in a UAW local at Ford, are more responsive to Mr. Jackson's populism and to the activist appeal of groups like the Arab American Institute, which organizes on Mr. Jackson's behalf. Many of these workers have come from the Mideast in the past 20 years, and have more first-hand experience with the tensions in the region.    Dearborn's congressman, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell, has thrown himself into the fight on behalf of Rep. Gephardt, but he must compete with almost daily reports of violence on the West Bank.    &quot;They're searching for a political identity,&quot; says Christopher Smith, a Dingell ally and chairman of the Democratic Party's district organization. &quot;As a group -- one of the last immigrant groups -- they really don't have a clear political loyalty. Four years ago the Arab-American community was going along with the political mainstream. Now Jackson has absolutely had an impact.&quot;    Sami Kassab, 46, is an Iraqi-born Catholic who believes in capital punishment and voted four years ago for President Reagan. But the Iraqi-American community was infuriated by U.S. arms sales to Iran. Now Mr. Kassab -- a successful grocer living a suburban life far removed from his old job at a Chrysler stamping plant -- pledges money and his vote to Mr. Jackson.    With the New York primary only weeks away, Mr. Jackson appears careful to avoid the hostility he incurred among Jewish voters in 1984. His rhetoric is measured, and to the degree that American Jews themselves are distressed by the violence in Gaza and the West Bank, he has more freedom to maneuver.    He supports a new Palestinian state, but casts Israelis and Arabs alike as victims of a &quot;cycle of death&quot; that can be broken only when world powers end what he says is a &quot;racist&quot; acceptance of conflict in the region.    It is a message that is short on specifics, but one that builds on the emotional, religious imagery of the Rev. Jackson's campaign. At a black church last week, the candidate was hailed as a modern Joshua and the virtual &quot;resurrection&quot; of the slain civil-rights leader, Martin Luther King Jr. Hours later, in an Islamic mosque on the same street, he held hands aloft with Imam Mohamad Jawad Chirri, a white-turbaned Shiite cleric, and pledged that &quot;the cedars of Lebanon must wave in the breeze again.&quot;    &quot;A candidate who tells the truth, a candidate who believes the truth, a candidate for the people,&quot; says the imam. &quot;We've needed him for a long time.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
