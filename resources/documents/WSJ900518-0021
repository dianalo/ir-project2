The banking companies -- Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corp.,BankAmerica Corp. and MNC Financial Corp. -- asked theFederal Reserve Board, the Federal Communications Commissionand the Georgia state Banking Department to examine whetherthe ATandamp;T venture violates banking and communications law.Three of the companies also have raised banking issues withthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</LP><TEXT>   The complaints come as card-industry analysts estimatethat ATandamp;T has received more than 10 million inquiries so far.They say that ATandamp;T has approved and issued between 200,000and 300,000 of its Universal credit cards since the unveilingon March 26, numbers that ATandamp;T won't confirm.   But James L. Bailey, group executive for Citicorp's U.S.credit cards, said, &quot;We would welcome any competition. We'renot trying to keep anyone out. But there are questions abouthow ATandamp;T has entered the business and how the Universal Bankis structured.&quot;   In fact, Mr. Bailey said the Universal card has had noimpact on Citicorp. &quot;Our sales in May are over our forecast,and our account acquisitions are on target.&quot;   &quot;The issues that have been raised {are} nothing that wedidn't anticipate. . . . {They} are without merit,&quot; saidPeter Gallagher, senior vice president in charge ofregulatory and consumer affairs for ATandamp;T Universal CardServices Corp. &quot;We feel we did our homework and anticipatedwhat the possible questions would be. We're in this businessto stay.&quot;   ATandamp;T has teamed up with the second-largest processor ofcredit cards in the country, Total Systems Services Inc., asubsidiary of Synovus Financial Corp., a Columbus, Ga., bankholding company. Another Synovus subsidiary, Universal Bank,is the issuer of the cards and handles billing on cardtransactions.   The banks have charged that ATandamp;T, in effect, controlsUniversal Bank and is therefore violating federal bankinglaws, which forbid commercial and industrial companies fromowning commercial banks. ATandamp;T owns a small stake in UniversalBank and buys the bank's credit card receivables.   The banks also allege that Universal Bank is no more thana funding vehicle for an unregulated affiliate, namely ATandamp;T,and that Universal is grossly undercapitalized, given that ithas only $3 million in capital, but has ambitions to reachfive million customers in the next few years.   In the FCC complaint, the banks argue that the 10%discount on long-distance calls that ATandamp;T is giving itscardholders amounts to &quot;predatory pricing&quot; against othertelecommunication providers and a tariff reduction that theFCC hasn't sanctioned. What's more, say the banks, if ATandamp;Twere to contend Universal Bank is giving the discount, thenthe banks would argue Universal is reselling long-distanceservice without FCC sanction.   ATandamp;T has refused to give figures on how many of itscustomers have been issued the cards. But Mr. Gallagher saidthe company received 250,000 inquiries from its customers inthe 24-hour period after announcing its Universal bank card,about 15 times what it had been expecting the first day.   &quot;From March 26 to May 17, our expectations have beenexceeded by 250%,&quot; Mr. Gallagher said. &quot;It has exceeded ourwildest expectations.&quot;   The big challenge for ATandamp;T will be to turn these Universalcard customers into late-paying credit card customers. Thecompany already has 46 million users of its long-distancecalling card, but its customers are notorious on-time payers,an anathema to a credit issuer that seeks to profit fromfinance charges.   Moreover, the big banks have a huge head start over ATandamp;T.Citicorp is the largest issuer of credit cards, with morethan 37 million card holders world-wide. Chase, BankAmericaand MNC, the parent of Maryland National Bank, are second,third and sixth, respectively.   Still, some experts expect ATandamp;T to be one of the topplayers within a few years. ATandamp;T Universal Card has set up anoperation in Jacksonville, Fla., that can handle theback-office and telemarketing needs of a financial servicescompany with millions of customers.   &quot;ATandamp;T won't make any money on this for two to threeyears,&quot; said Spencer Nilson, who publishes the Nilson Report,a newsletter on the credit industry. But &quot;within five years,they'll have 35 million cardholders. They're terriblyefficient. I'd say they're issuing about 7,500 cards a day. Igot my card within seven days, compared with more than threeweeks with some other cards.&quot;   At least one credit card expert saw the bank action as anattempt to stifle the card's success. &quot;It's a harassmentaction,&quot; said Elgie Holstein, executive director of theBankcard Holders of America, a nonprofit consumer credit,education and advocacy group. &quot;This is an attempt to do in amajor new competitor by . . . companies that are engaged inacquiring portfolios of smaller and medium-sized players.They're the primary movers in the increasing consolidationand decreasing competitiveness of the industry.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
