The methodis based on a bipolar gradient motion refocusing technique in combinationwith spin-echo sequences or gradient-echo sequences and a two-dimensionalor three-dimensional acquisition technique, respectively. Isotropic three-dimensionalresolution of about 1.2 mm facilitates identification of vascular structure.However, the discrimination of vascular abnormalities is still betteron two-dimensional images with highest in-plane resolution. Vessels andvascular diseases are clearly delineated on subtraction images of flow-enhancedand flow-suppressed sequences with a spatial resolution of 0.5 mm. Thepotential of MR imaging-angiography is demonstrated in 20 patients whounderwent correlative x-ray studies (conventional angiography, digitalsubtraction angiography).</TEXT></DOC>
