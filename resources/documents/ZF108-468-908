PeepandM;The title line telegraphs critical information.andP;  A strong title line containsat least the name of the model, the date it was completed, and the person whowrote it.andP;  Plain names are more informative than abbreviations.andP;  Nouns andverbs tell more than adjectives.andM;Choosing the right name for your model is especially important when yourmodel will immediately become the property of several people or must fit intoan existing scheme of documents.andP;  Others can immediately identify how yourcontribution fits into the group effort if the name follows a localconvention.andM;Suppose your model is the third one supporting a proposal to the AcornCorporation.andP;  You might want the title to be &quot;Acorn Proposal #33 Model #3.&quot;andO;But if it must fit in the eight characters of a DOS filename, it requiressome abbreviation.andP;  Here is how one standard might appear:andM;Weak  StrongandM;ACP33MO3  ACP33MO3 (Acorn Corporation Proposal 33, Model 3) 24 May 1488 T.andO;TuckerandM;Terse titles that follow an established abbreviation standard need a decodedexplanation in the spreadsheet itself.andP;  The strong example shows how athree-line title can meet a terse naming standard yet remain comprehensibleto a busy reader.andP;  Naming conventions also need the support of:andM;* A list of the current conventions posted on the wall near every computerusing the names.andM;* A regular, attentive review and update procedure.andM;* A manager or librarian to oversee the function.andM;A useful bit of information to have along with the title is the date thecurrent copy was printed.andP;  You may add this to your spreadsheet using the@TODAY function or, for 1-2-3 Release 2.01 and later, the @NOW function andthe label &quot;: Date Printed.&quot;andM;Weak  StrongandM;Sheep 22 June 1563 B. Peep  Sheep 22 June 1563 B. Peep 12-Dec-88: DatePrintedandM;The strong title are tells you that while the spreadsheet was written a longtime ago, the copy you are reading was printed rathern recently.andP;  The dateprinted warns you to be alert for undocumented revisions, and lets you knowwhether you're reading the lates data.andM;There is no magic in having only a few lines for the title.andP;  When thecritical information grows to several lines to meet work demands, the titleline can become a title area, so familiar that it can be read like a titleline.andP;  The title, line or area, should telegraph critical information.andM;StrongandM;Several critical pieces of information appear in Silver Bells.andP;  The formalheading identifies the owner of the information and notifies the reader thatthis information is confidential.andP;  Not only do you have the name, date, andauthor, you know the department name, the division name, and the name of thecorporation.andP;  This example shows that on August 12, 1560, Mary Contrarycompleted the spreadsheet Silver Bells while she was in the Garden Departmentof the Outdoor Division of the Nursery Kingdom.andM;A modification is also mentioned here.andP;  You know that Contrary revised themodel on September 23, 1561.andP;  Another style of doing the revision historycould allow for the insertion of further updates.andM;This modification format allows the reader to scan the history of changes tothe original spreadsheet.andP;  You can see that Contrary most recently added arow for pretty maids and before that a column of cockleshells.andP;  If thespreadsheet starts to misbehave when you use it, you have some strong hintsabout where to begin looking for recently introduced errors.andP;  When themodification history grows unwieldy, rewrite the spreadsheet and revise theentire introduction.andM;Declare the Model's PurposeandM;The model's purpose should be immediately apparent.andP;  The reader needs to knowthat his purposes and the spreadsheet's are similar.andP;  After the reader knowswhat the model intends to achieve, he must have some idea about how the modelwill achieve it.andP;  This does not require a lengthy description, just a clearone.andP;  The model's intentions should be honorably and clearly stated.andM;Weak  StrongandM;Set of accounts on the  The purpose of this model king's travels.andP;  is tomaintain a set of accounts on the king's travels.andM;Accounts receivable.andP;  Here, accounts receivable are managed by recordingtransactions and printing summary reports.andM;Expense reports.andP;  This spreadsheet prints the queen's expense reports.andM;One hallmark of a strong description is a telling verb, an action word thatconveys the activity of the model.andP;  The right verb animates the descriptionand quickly conveys the model's purpose.andP;  The phrase &quot;The purpose of thismodel is&quot; leaves no question in the reader's mind about the model's goal.andM;Weak  StrongandM;Add all the tasks' means  Estimate the length of a and variances and compute project that consists of the project's mean and  several tasks.andP;  variance.andM;Add all the tasks' means and variances and compute the project's mean andvariance.andM;First describe the goal, then how to achieve it.andP;  Only if the reader wants toestimate a project's length is he interested in the method.andP;  The weak versionmakes a good second line in the strong version.andP;  Answer &quot;What?&quot; before &quot;How?&quot;andO;Be sure everyone has agreed on the shape of the mountain before they climbit.andM;Here you see a model devoid of content, yet with a description that serves apurpose.andP;  The description succinctly tells what SMALLNEW's purpose is: toprovide a framework with which to begin building models.andP;  This is a startupmodel that you can use to make other models.andP;  The simple template saves youfrom having to think about how to organize your work.andP;  It allows you to beginby editing rather than writing.andM;Give Clear InstructionsandM;Just as the initial description bridges the gap between the model and theoutside world, clear instructions can bridge the gap between the person whoputs information into a model and the one who reads the information.andP;  Somewho work with a model will read only a paper copy.andP;  Others will see it inoperation on a computer screen.andP;  The description may satisfy the reader, butthe user often needs instructions.andP;  A step-by-step, numbered list is anexcellent way to give clear instructions.andM;WeakandM;StrongandM;The weak and strong examples differ in two important aspects.andP;  The obviousaspect is that the strong version is a numbered list.andP;  The numbers explicitlyorder the steps and make it easy for a user to check off each step as it iscompleted.andP;  The subtle aspect is that the weak version is not as clear as itshould be.andP;  The weak version is a first draft.andP;  After you write instructions,be sure to let someone else try to follow them.andP;  Such a trial will show youwhether the directions are adequate and, if not, how they can be improved.andO;The strong version is a revised draft that was written after readers hadtrouble following the weak version.andM;Here is another set of directions taken completely out of context:andM;Notice that these instructions can stand by themselves.andP;  Even without theirmodel they make a certain amount of sense.andP;  They are broken into pieces thatmake it easy for the user to locate where to do which steps.andP;  The directionsare further clarified in the actual model by a working example thatillustrates where within the area to do each step.andM;A long list of instructions raises the question of its placement.andP;  Aconvenient spot is often just before the initial data area.andP;  Sometimes,however, the user's needs are best served by including instructions nearerthe point where they will be used.andP;  In a large model with many pieces, thismeans that the directions will be moved from the top of the model to the partof the model where the user will be working.andP;  If significant instructionshave been moved, leave a note to that effect in the description at the top.andO;For example:andM;StrongandM;Instructions on how to use the Monte Carlo portion of the model appear there.andM;The user can quickly see that the additional support will be available on theMonte Carlo method near its use in the model.andM;Reference Critical IdeasandM;Provide a full, accurate guide to the journal, book, or professionalcommunication where the idea for your spreadsheet originated.andP;  Many ideas ina model are original and some borrowed ideas are too simple to bear mention,but an important idea should reveal its past.andP;  If it is incorrect, the readermust be given a chance to discover the source of the error.andP;  Sometimes anenterprising reader will spot an idea, follow the reference to the source,and work forward to compose a model tailored to his special needs.andP;  Do notdeny the reader this link to the past.andM;StrongandM;Reference: The Real Mother Goose, Chicago, IL: Rand McNally, 1916.andM;Reference: Kepner, Charles H., and Tregoe, Benjamin B., The New RationalManager, Princeton, NJ: Princeton Research Press, 1981.andM;Reference: See Materials Handling Procedure Manual, Document Number A34.77,Rev.andP;  3.6, pp.andP;  64-68.andM;Reference: If you have any questions, call Bo Peep at extension 3456.andM;A reference need not be only to a book.andP;  A knowledgeable individual, a filewith the related information, as well as a standard form the organization hasbeen using for years can be appropriate references.andM;Map the ContentsandM;The underlying organization of a spreadsheet is spatial.andP;  Geography is all.andO;Letting the reader know where things are requires a map.andP;  One of the moreconvenient maps is a table of contents, the last part of the Introduction inall but the smallest spreadsheets.andP;  As soon as the spreadsheet grows beyond asingle screen and moves beyond your visual span of control, you will need atable of contents to indicate where you are.andM;StrongandM;A table of contents is a powerful organizer for a reader.andP;  If the reader isconcerned only with the spending report, he can focus his attention on it atonce.andP;  But if he wishes to know more about the data that led to the graphs,he knows where to look.andM;You can name the areas of the spreadsheet with range names and display themin the table of contents to keep them visible.andP;  When you do this you may jumpto any area with very few keystrokes (the GoTo key, the Name key, and selectthe name of the range you wish to jump to).andM;StrongandM;Here the named range is on the left and a larger explanation appears on theright.andP;  TENPENCE gives the user an extra reason to be interested in the tableof contents: By using the named ranges, the user can jump to the right placein the spreadsheet.andP;  Named ranges also avoid the annoying problem of usingcell locations that must be changed whenever the spreadsheet is rearranged.andO;The reader of a printed version of the model welcomes the extra informationabout the organization of the spreadsheet.andM;StrongandM;This template, NEW, extends the template SMALLNEW by including a table ofcontents.andP;  NEW is the common starting place for most of the spreadsheetsincluded here.andP;  With the ranges already named, the user has a head start withthe work.andM;Sometimes a model's geography has horizontal spread as well as verticaldepth.andP;  If so, beneath the table of contents include a map that is a visualguide to the location of sections of the spreadsheet.andP;  For example, a tableof contents may look like this:andM;CONTENTSandM;Raw material purchases Payables Finished product orders Receivables Generalledger PayrollandM;It it does, include this under the table:andM;MAPandM;Raw material purchases Payables General ledger Payroll Finished productorders ReceivablesandM;The reader knows when to go down and when to go sideways.andP;  The raw materialsand finished products are arranged in parallel.andP;  They feed the generalledger, which is below them.andP;  The payroll is a separate function below thegeneral ledger.andP;  The map tells the user where to insert rows and columnssafely and where the lower right corner of the model is: below payroll and tothe right of receivables.andM;Experienced users agree that a map is a powerful way to regain control over aspreadsheet that has gotten out of hand.andP;  The map organizes and informs.andO;Sometimes it will even point out how to reorganize your model.andP;  It willalways make your entire model easier to grasp.andM;Beyond a sharp title, a clear purpose, good directions, helpful references,and a simple map, your Introduction may include other information.andP;  What youadd to the description depends on the model's function, the reader'sknowledge, the user's skill, and the framework of the organization withinwhich the model wil be used.andP;  Err on the side of overinforming your reader.andO;He may not be stupid, but he is probably more ignorant than you suspect.andO;Your Introduction should include everything necessary to make a successfulbridge from the model to the world in which it will be used.andM;AFter the spreadsheet has been thoroughly introduced and explained, it mutset to work to achieve its purpose.andP;  Good spreadsheet form is more a questionof architecture than of interior design.andP;  The next rules define the secondand third parts--the major architectural elements--of the basic form: theInitial Data Area and the Model Area.andP;  The spreadsheet's goal is to arriveclearly at the desired results, and each part serves this goal in its ownway.andP;  The Initial Data Area stores the beginning material of the model, theraw data and the initial assumptions.andP;  The Model Area is where formulasmanufacture consequences from the raw material.andP;  Here, complex formulas areexplained, intermediate terms appear, and final results are often displayed.andM;THE INITIAL DATA AREAandM;Data are the grist for the model's mill.andP;  They are numbers you know when youwrite the model.andP;  They may be three key constants or 3,000 items in adatabase.andP;  They belong in their own area, where they may be clearly labeledand conveniently arranged.andP;  Such an area makes it easy for both the readerand user to identify the data.andP;  Without an Initial Data Area, a weak modelcan be an unintended mystery.andM;The Initial Data Area sketches the scope of the model before you actuallyencounter the Model Area.andP;  When you have seen the initial values, you canguess at the information to be derived from them.andP;  By knowing which terms arethe independent assumptions, you have a good idea how the model may bemanipulated to yield a variety of answers.andM;Storing the data in a separate Initial Data Area makes it easier to ask the&quot;what if&quot; questions that depend on varying the initial data.andP;  You can alsoupdate a whole set of initial data without getting ensnarled in the thicketof formulas in the Model Area.andP;  Keeping the data separte from the modellessens the chance that you will accidentally alter a formula.andP;  Here areexamples of weak and strong Initial Data Areas:andM;You see how much easier it is to use a model when you start out with some ofthe answers rather than having to play detective.andP;  PLANB tells you more thanPLANA.andP;  You can understand for the first time what the raw data of this modelare: the starting year of 1486, starting sales of $100, the constant $7depreciation, and the constant $2.25 interest.andP;  You feel you have some of theanswers to the mystery.andM;Yet for all its improvement over PLANA, PLANB is not complete.andP;  Thespreadsheet still hides assumptions from the reader.andM;Surface and Label Every AssumptionandM;One of the more serious errors in spreadsheet modeling is that of burying anassumption.andP;  A raw number--a constant, a factor, or a rate--can lurksubmerged in a formula.andP;  Such an assumption must be forced to the surface andclearly labeled.andP;  It should be placed before the model in the Initial DataArea.andM;Bringing an assumption to the surface gives you an opprotunity to label it.andO;It can go a long way toward explaining the true nature of the model.andM;Finally you see the hidden detail.andP;  The buried assumptions are: the 8 percentannual growth rate; the 42.5 percent cost of goods sold a sa percentage ofsales; the 33 percent selling, general, and administrative costs as apercentage of sales; the 15 percent interest rate; and the 40 percent taxrate.andP;  You also see that depreciation and debt are assumed to be constantover the five years.andP;  Because the constants are spread out in the initialdata, the reader may infer that the author thought it was likely that theuser might like to change a value in any year.andM;THE MODEL AREAandM;A model is a web of relations woven with formulas.andP;  If you have assidouslyseparated raw data and initial assumptions from the model, then the modelshould be devoted only to formulas.andM;Model to ExplainandM;The formulas of the model are themselves assumptions.andP;  The firstresponsibility of the Model Area is to explain what assumptions are embeddedin the formulas.andP;  The Modeal Area should provide three levels of explanation:andM;1.andP;  The values that appear in the model.andM;2.andP;  The written explanation of any tricky formulas.andM;3.andP;  The complete printouf of all of the formulas in the model.andM;The Model Area's first level of explanation is the values that appear in thecells.andP;  IF a formula produces results that are not entirely clear, it is agood idea to break the formula into its component pieces, where each step canbe viewed.andM;WeakandM;1402.08 :Total expense 674.08  :Total adjustmentandM;StrongandM;1402.08 :Total expense 250.00  :Cash advance 478.00  :Other Prepaid 674.08 :Total adjustmentandM;Here you see how the total travel expenses were reduced by cash advances andprepaid charges (such as conference registrations) to arrive at th etotaladjustment.andP;  In the weak example, the intermediate numbers are hidden in aformula; in the strong one, they are presented as intermediate results.andM;How much to explain depends on the reader's and the user's backgrounds.andP;  Whenyou are in doubt, err on the side of overexplaining.andP;  Six months later,oversimplified steps will be a welcome relief as you struggle to read yourown model.andP;  If others use the model, the steps will increase their confidencein its accuracy.andM;A formula should be easy to read aloud.andP;  If it's not, the formula probablyshould be broken into two formulas.andP;  If you break a formula into pieces andhte intermediate values in the extra cells intrude upon the layout of thereport you were preparing, create a separate region below the model formaking the report.andM;The Model Area's second level of explanation is a written summary of a trickyformula.andP;  The next model changes the independent variable from sales to netincome.andP;  As a result, the Model Area must explain some tricky formulas.andM;You need help with the formulas in this model because PLAND turns PLANC onits head.andP;  PLANC began with sales and ended with net income; PLAND does thereverse.andP;  In the inverted model, a few formulas get compiled the spreadsheetwith King Jaguar and hopes to market the program to astromers who don't havespreadsheet software.andM;As a member of the Chicago-based Tax Technology Group, Dan Trznadel helpeddevelop a personal tax planning template used in Arthur Andersen officesnationwide.andP;  By hiding the calculations in the Baler-compiled spreadsheet,the accounting firm is able to keep its formulas secret.andM;In each of these cases, the initial template was created in Lotus 1-2-3.andO;Greater security, lower cost, and better appearance were obtained with BalerSpreadsheet Compiler Version 5.0, Sheng Lab's King Jaguar 1.0, and Soft-LogicSolutions' @Liberty 2.01.andM;Although compiling spreadsheets is not as difficult as it used to be, the jobrequires an intermediate knowledge of your spreadsheet program and advancedpatience.andP;  The three compilers we looked at have varied features, but usingany of them involes the same steps:andM;1.andP;  CREATE THE SPREADSHEETandM;Use any electronic spreadsheet program that can save worksheets in a .WK1 or.WKS format.andP;  That includes Lotus 1-2-3, of course, as well as Quattro,Quattro Pro, Excel, VP-Planner, Symphony, SuperCalc, and Multiplan.andM;While you're still in the creation stage, you should do some heavy-dutythinking and planning.andP;  Follow Nevison's guidelines in constructing yourspreadsheet.andP;  Make sure the worksheet includes instructions--not only on howto use it and what data to fill in, but also on what to do with the worksheetafter someone's through with it.andP;  Include a phone number for advice if it'sneeded.andP;  Since compiling can hide formulas, it's particularly important tomake assumptions and reasoning as clear as possible.andM;When constructing formulas and macros, pay close attention to the compiler'srules.andP;  All of them have quirks and limitations that may prevent you frombuilding formulas and macros the way you're used to.andM;Simple projects, such as creating a template to collect data, are quick andeasy.andP;  Just identify and unprotect input cells and freeze label and formulacells.andP;  More complex models require some advance planning to accommodate theneeds of the compilers.andP;  For example, King Jaguar and Baler allow formulasinside macros.andP;  @Liberty requires you to put formulas in a separate cellreferenced within the macro.andM;The manuals for all three programs identify which 1-2-3 commands andfunctions may cause problems and how to avoid them.andP;  Baler and @Liberty alsoprovide tutorials to help you wade through deeper waters.andM;In all cases, you must determine up front how many cells you'll need to leavefor data to be filled in later, because compiling freezes the size of theworksheet.andM;2.andP;  COMPILE THE SPREADSHEETandM;Compiling the spreadsheet is the simplest part of the process.andP;  Run thecompiler program and give it the name of the worksheet to compile.andP;  Compilingtake anywhere from a few seconds for a simple application to 30 to 40 minutesfor a complex financial or scientific model.andP;  King Jaguar lags behind Balerand @Liberty.andM;After compiling, you must debug the results.andP;  This is where it gets tricky.andO;Debugging can take a lot longer than compiling, depending on the complexityof your formulas and macros.andP;  Even if you've tried to follow all the rules,you may find bugs in your first compiled worksheet, especially if you'recompiling an older worksheet that you built without compiling in mind.andM;All of the programs provide a means of testing macros after compiling,somewhat like 1-2-3's Step function.andP;  But it still takes time and patiencethe first time.andM;To help with debugging, King Jaguar generates a special file that allows youto set breakpoints that help you spot exactly where bugs appear.andP;  But sinceKing Jaguar compiles macros, their code is frozen and you must go back to theoriginal spreadsheet to correct the macros and then recompile the worksheet.andM;Baler does not compile macros, so you can change them without repeating thecompiling process.andP;  Later, after debugging, you can use Baler's securityfeatures to freeze the entire application.andP;  You can even lock out anotherBaler user.andP;  Baler prepares diagnostic reports, showing formulas, values,cell protection status, and cell dependencies, to help with debugging.andM;@Liberty's Development Scratchpad tests macros or spreadsheet instructionsbefore compiling.andP;  You save a macro by itself and run the macro in thescratchpad.andP;  @Liberty also has a function to step through a macro one stageat a time until you spot where it's breaking down.andM;3.andP;  IMPROVE THE SPREADSHEETandM;This is where the fun starts.andM;All three compilers provide special macros and commands to change colors andimprove on the drab Lotus-look of a spreadsheet.andP;  You can also includecommands to allow other users to change the colors.andM;@Liberty has the fewest options.andP;  The program removes most Lotus menu optionsfrom the compiled spreadsheets although you can add many of them back withmacros.andP;  @Liberty allows you to create and display only three types ofgraphs: stacked bar, grouped bar, and X-Y plot.andP;  You can print graphs onlywith the print-screen command.andM;Baler has lots of customizing options, and it's the easiest to use.andP;  You cancreate a title screen, pull-down menus, pop-up windows, and addcontext-sensitive help screens.andP;  Baler also lets you disable selected 1-2-3commands and set security levels to both hide data and prevent input toselected cells.andM;BalerDRAW, a Baler add-in that comes with the program, creates a new driverset that suports the upper-level ASCII characters, allowing you to draw linesto box data or instructions.andP;  BaleDRAW works only with releases of 1-2-3through 2.2 and earlier versions of Symphony.andP;  (The company is preparingversions for Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3 and Quattro.)andM;King Jaguar's macros provide some ability to set display colors, controlkeyboard input, and create context-sensitive help.andP;  The program'sUser-Defined Functions (UDFs) allow you to create pop-up or pull-down menus.andM;King Jaguar lets programmers access their own external UDFs in C or assemblylanguage to add functions to compiled applications.andP;  Baler plans a summerrelease that will allow UDFs programmed in C or BASIC.andM;(Compile 1 to C is another compiler C programmers will appreciate.andP;  Itscompilations are in C code that a programmer can modify.andP;  Nonprogrammers canlet Compile 1 to C link the source code automatically.andP;  We did not receive acopy of the program, available for $299 from Resource Analysis International,213-390-7661, in time to test it thoroughly.)andM;4.andP;  ADD THE ENGINEandM;Now your spreadsheet learns to fly on its own.andM;To make a spreadsheet run independent of its original program, each compilercreates an engine to use the spreadsheet from DOS.andP;  There's no limit to thenumber of runtime engines you can distribute.andM;Compiled spreadsheets are smaller than their original versions.andP;  But @Libertyand Baler need an extra file in addition to the spreadsheet.andP;  King Jaguarneeds two extra files.andP;  The extra files contain the engines to use thespreadsheets without their original programs and any options you've added tothe worksheets.andP;  A large spreadsheet with its engine files may not fit on a360K floppy disk, an important consideration when planning distribution ofthe finished product.andP;  (See the chart for the sizes of engines and RAM neededto run compiled worksheets.)andM;Adding the engine is straightforward; you simply execute a compiler commandto create the engine.andP;  King Jaguar lets you link macros and UDFs to create anengine that you can reuse for other applications.andM;5.andP;  DISTRIBUTE YOUR APPLICATIONandM;If you've designed the spreadsheet carefully and taken advantage of thecustomizing features of the compiler, you have an application that'sattractive, easy to use, and protects important formulas and macros.andP;  And itmay even run faster than its Lotus counterpart.andM;Before you distribute it to everyone who needs a copy, give the compiledspreadsheet to someone who will be using it.andP;  Find out if the instructionsare clear or if any complications slipped through the debugging.andM;If everything checks out, distribute the spreadsheet to everyone.andP;  If thepurpose of the worksheet is to collect data that will be combined into amaster spreadsheet, make sure your users know when to return it.andP;  If you givea range name to the data area that goes into the compilation, the personhandling the master worksheet can easily import the data into an ordinaryworksheet.andM;tricky; they have been explained near where they occur.andP;  PLAND also reversesthe order of the lines in the model to make the top-to-bottom orientation ofthe reader correspond to the top-to-bottom flow of the calculation.andP;  TheModel Area is trying above all to explain how the calculations are performed.andM;The Model Area's third level of explanation of the calculations consists ofprinted copies of all the formulas in the model, one copy showing the resultsof the formulas and the other copy showing the formulas themselves.andP;  ForPLAND they might look like this:andM;To print the model so that the formulas are shown, call up a copy of thespreadsheets and save it under a different name.andP;  Convert the display to allformulas through repeated use of the Range Format Text command.andP;  Widen eachcolumn until all formulas are completely visible, and then print theworksheet.andM;Formulas may appear in other parts of the spreadsheet besides the Model Area,such as in the Initial Data Area to be sure that one piece of data impliesanother.andP;  For example, if you want to divide something between two playersusing a percentage, the results might look like this:andM;The strong version uses a formula to avoide an entry error.andP;  One entry getstwo correct results.andM;Point to the Right SourceandM;As you build your formulas, you will have occasion to refer to an earliercell for a value.andP;  Whenever you do this, be sure you are referring to theright occurrence of the value.andP;  That is, be sure you point to the value thatmakes it easiest for the reader and user to understand the formula.andM;If the best source is another cell in the body of the model, it will benearby and will have the context of the model to help explain it.andP;  If thebest source is in the initial data, it will probably have some explanatorytext near it.andP;  The right source is the one that speeds the reader'scomprehension of the formula.andM;For example, consider the following three lines that reveal formulas from thebody of the model in PLANC.andM;The formula for selling, general, and administrative costs (SGandamp;A) uses thefixed percentage found in the initial area at $B$18.andP;  Initial data items thatappear as single values are often used as &quot;absolute&quot; cells in model formulas.andO;In this case, pointing to the original source is the method that bestillustrates what the formula means.andM;In line 34, however, you see a different solution to the problem.andP;  The goodformula C34=+C32+C33 says &quot;add the two lines above.&quot;andP;  Fixed expenses equalsSGandamp;A plus depreciation.andP;  Any other form would make more work for the reader.andO;The poor alternative C34=+C32+C23 embroils the reader in an unnecessarysearch for what's going on up in row 23.andM;When a line, a column, or a row of ininitial data such as depreciation isrepeated in the model itself, the best course is usually to refer to thenearby line in the model.andP;  The nearby line is easier to find.andM;An isolated single value, however, should almost always be referred to theoriginal source.andP;  If you make it a habit to refer to the original source, thereader of the paper version can make sense out of the model more quikly, andthe user of the model can handle the model with greater certainty.andP;  Bothpeople know that if they change the model in the Initial Data Area, they arechanging the unique reference point that feeds formulas all over the model.andM;The Dual Role of the Model AreaandM;In the spreadsheet's basic form, the Model Area plays two roles--as the areathat explains the calculations and as the area that displays the results.andO;(Many spreadsheets can be built with the Model Area also serving as a Reportarea that prints the results.)andP;  The two roles of the Model Area create someserious questions about the relationship between the Initial Data Area andthe Model Area.andP;  At first, the idea of a separate Initial Data Area mayappear to violate the fundamental simplicity of spreadsheets.andP;  But rememberthat the rule is not &quot;Set up an Initial Data Area,&quot; the rule is &quot;Identify thedata.&quot;andM;The mystery spreadsheet on the following page focuses the issue.andP;  What do youcall it?andM;Mystery spreadsheetandM;Mass of rawandM;numbers inandM;a large tableandM;Row of column sums...andM;Column of row sumsandM;...Grand totalandM;Is this a Data Area with a few extra formulas?andP;  Or a Model Area without anInitial Data Area?andM;To answer these questions, remind yourself that the Initial Data Areaidentifies the raw data and the Model Area explains the calculation.andP;  If youcan make one area display the raw data and explain the calculation, then callit an Initial Data Area.andP;  The first requirement is the greatest requirement:You must always identify the data.andM;If the mystery spreadsheet is an Initial Data Area with a few added formulas,and if you add more formulas to the first few, at what point should thespreadsheet spawn a Model Area?andP;  Consider the following spreadsheet:andM;Initial Data AreaandM;Mass of rawandM;INTERMEDIATE ROW OF FORMULASandM;numbers inandM;INTERMEDIATE ROW OF FORMULASandM;a large tableandM;Row of column sums...andM;Column of row sumsandM;....Grand totalandM;When should you split this into two areas?andP;  When you become uncomfortablethinking that identifying the data is the primary purpose of the spreadsheet.andO;When the calculation become confused or obscure.andP;  When you need room torearrange the model to make it easier to read.andP;  Any one of these reasons issufficient cause for a Model Area, like so:andM;Initial Data AreaandM;Mass of rawandM;numbers inandM;a large tableandM;(with explanations.)andM;Model AreaandM;Mass of rawandM;INTERMEDIATE ROW OF FORMULASandM;number inandM;INTERMEDIATE ROW OF FORMULASandM;a large table.andM;Row of column sums...andM;Column of row sumsandM;.....Grand totalandM;When you break the spreadsheet into two areas, you may be bothered by seeinga big block of numbers twice, but you will find compensatory freedoms.andP;  Youwill be able to label the Initial Data clearly without intruding on yourmodel's format.andP;  You will also be able to shape the model to reveal what thecalculations are and to convince the reader that these calculations arecorrect.andM;If separating the Initial Data Area and the Model Area makes you feel stupidat firts, do it anyway.andP;  If, after a few months of going out of your way toapply these rules, your models are not substantially better, back off fromthis practice until you find a balance that is right for you and for theusers of your spreadsheets.andP;  Your overriding concern should be for ease ofuse over ease of construction, for clarity of expression over speed ofwriting.andM;Spreadsheets Without Model AreasandM;Some spreadsheets are exceptions to the basic rules.andP;  Rules should aid yourcommon sense, not replace it.andP;  Some spreadsheets honestly do not need a ModelArea.andP;  Here's one example.andM;TRAVEL is a spreadsheet that does not need a Model Area.andP;  It has only veryfew simple equations.andP;  Its purpose is to identify the initial data andpresent it clearly, so the author call si an Initial Data Area with a fewtotals.andP;  We do not have a Model Area at all.andP;  What we print out is theInitial Data Area.andM;Databases are another case where the Initial Data Area overwhelms the ModelArea.andP;  Often, however, databases trail summary reports that are Model Areas.andM;SHEEP is a collection of data with a modest model wagging along behind.andO;There are no major assumptions, just a collection of data.andM;Data in a database may be so large and may change so frequently that you wantto keep it below the rest of the model.andP;  This practice has the advantage thatthe location of your reports remains stable because it is above the insertionand deletion of rows that constantly vary the size of the database.andP;  If thesheep herd had numbered in the hundreds, Bo Peep might have structured themodel like this:andM;All these rules are not intended to set brittle standardsandM;of performance.andP;   They are intended to encourageandM;you to think seriously about the purpose of you work.andP;  If they help you formthe habits of careful spreadsheet construction, of reflection and revision,of precision and focus, they will dramatically enhance your professionalproductivity.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
