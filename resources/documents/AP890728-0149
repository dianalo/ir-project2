Funds for those two systems, along with Bush's request for theMX rail missile and the single-warhead Midgetman missile, werereduced or cut out completely in the House-passed version of thedefense authorization bill on Thursday.   ``I am disappointed that the House did what they did,'' Bushsaid. He noted that the lawmakers restored money for some of thesystems that he and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney advocated cuttingout. ``Yesterday was not the House's most memorable moment, butwe're going to keep fighting on for what we believe in,'' he said.   Bush made the comments at a wide-ranging news conference that hecalled to spotlight the switch by Rep. Tommy Robinson of Arkansasfrom the Democratic to the Republican Party.   The president also expressed confidence he would prevail withhis multibillion-dollar bailout plan for the savings andamp; loanindustry, even though House and Senate negotiators this week agreedon a plan that rejects a key funding mechanism he has insisted on.   Touching on other areas in which he is encountering roughsledding in Congress, the president:   _ Staunchly defended his embattled nominee to head the JusticeDepartment's civil rights division, William Lucas.   _ Said he still wants a constitutional amendment to ban burningof the American flag, but ``I will see what comes down'' incongressional legislation that Democrats say would do the samething. The House Judiciary Committee this week approved thelegislation and blocked consideration of a constitutional amendment.   _ Said he is willing to ``see what can be worked out'' oncutting the capital gains tax. His proposal has encounteredsubstantial Democratic opposition as a boon to the rich. ``I don'tthink I should ever say it's got to be done just this way in termsof the bills up there in the House Ways and Means Committee rightnow,'' he said.   Asked about the legislative roadblocks that have met several ofhis proposals on Capitol Hill, Bush said, ``Nobody ever said itwould be easy.''   ``I would not give Congress very high marks,'' he added.   But he said he did not want to engage in inflammatory rhetoricbecause, with Democratic majorities in both the Senate and House,``I have to work with these people.''   ``It's a question of style, I think. I'll take a shot at themonce in a while if they get too outrageous,'' he said.   On defense spending, Bush said his own proposals alreadyincluded cuts in Star Wars spending, and ``we don't need furthercuts in SDI.''   The House chopped $1.8 billion from his request for $4.9 billion.   The president said he needs the ``solid strategic program'' hehas proposed in part because it strengthens his hand in armscontrol talks with the Soviet Union. ``I do not want to negotiatewith the Soviet Union without as many cards in my hand as possibleso there's an arms control dimension to what were talking about,too.''   On other topics, the president:   _ Said he was ``very concerned about premature discussion anddisclosure _ that means leaks'' about the case of Felix S. Bloch,the U.S. diplomat suspected of spying for the Soviets, ``because Ithink you can jeopardize the case itself and perhaps the man'sability to get a fair hearing.''   _ Acknowledged his advisers disagreed over allowing the exportof small personal computers to the Soviet Union, with DefenseSecretary Cheney opposed to it because of potential securityapplications. But Bush said he supported the Commerce Departmentdecision to allow the exports, which ``will not endanger thelegitimate national security needs of this country.''   _ Said he did not condone the kidnapping of a Shiite Moslemleader by Israeli commandos in Lebanon and doesn't know if the actcould lead to freedom for an American hostage.   _ Expressed frustration over the U.S. inability so far to getPanamanian ruler Manuel Noriega out of power. He said, ``I wish Icould give you a much clearer answer that there is some plan thatis going to solve this problem in the way it must be solved.'' Hespoke of the diplomatic effort by the Organization of AmericanStates as a sign of ``some hope'' to resolve the situation.   _ Refused to respond directly to harsh criticisms leveled byoutgoing Customs Commissioner William von Raab who said he saw alack of commitment or interest in the departments of State andTreasury on fighting the drug war. Bush said the real question was``how do we do better?'' and that nothing would be gained by``going around assigning blame to people that are trying hard.''</TEXT></DOC>
