The association, a powerful group representing 206 of theworld's airlines, said its internal auditor will look intoallegations that Edward Spry accepted improper payments fromAirline Economics Inc., a Washington consulting firm.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Spry resigned last week from his post as IATA'smanaging director, less than three months after his electionto the position.   An IATA spokesman said the auditor's report andrecommendations for action should be made to the group'sexecutive committee before the end of the month. IATA'sexecutive committee, whose chairman is Air France PresidentBernard Attali, is composed of 30 airline executives.   The spokesman didn't say what actions might be takenagainst Mr. Spry or within the organization itself if theallegations prove true. &quot;All our channels are open, but itwill depend on what the investigation comes up with,&quot; thespokesman said.   The allegations against Mr. Spry first emerged in a $3million civil suit filed in the U.S. last November by AirlineEconomics against its former president, Harold &quot;Hap&quot; Pareti.Airline Economics has charged Mr. Pareti, a former presidentof the failed People Express Airlines, with breaking hiscontract by starting another firm shortly after hisdeparture.   In a response to the suit, Mr. Pareti said he left AirlineEconomics because it had misrepresented to him its financialstatus -- he was planning to buy out the firm's two owners --and because of his displeasure with payments made to Mr.Spry.   In the court case, Airline Economics didn't deny that itpaid Mr. Spry $4,000 on &quot;several&quot; occasions, but assertedthat any payments were for work not related to his IATAduties and occurred before Mr. Pareti joined the consultingfirm in March 1990.   Neither IATA nor Mr. Spry are involved directly in thecourt case, and Mr. Spry hasn't been charged with anyillegality. Mr. Spry couldn't be reached for comment.   IATA became aware of the allegations when details of thecivil suit between Mr. Pareti and Airline Economics werepublished in the Jan. 6 issue of Travel Weekly, a U.S.publication. Mr. Spry wasn't identified in the article,although he is named in the court proceedings.   IATA rules permit its officials to accept payment foroutside work, but stipulate that all such activity must firstbe approved by the director general. The IATA spokesman saidMr. Spry hadn't sought approval.   On Jan. 8, Mr. Spry offered to resign. His offer wasaccepted by the executive committee last Monday.   In the meantime, IATA has appointed Ron Blake, theassociation's treasurer and comptroller, to the post ofinterim managing director. A permanent replacement for Mr.Spry will be appointed after consultation between theexecutive committee and IATA Director General-DesignatePierre Jeanniot, former president and chief executive of AirCanada, whose appointment won't take effect until mid-1992.   Mr. Spry, 47 years old, began his career at KLM RoyalDutch Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines System before movingto IATA, where he spent 18 years. A highly regardedeconomist, he rose to the position of senior director ofindustry automation and financial services before hisappointment last October as managing director.</TEXT></DOC>
