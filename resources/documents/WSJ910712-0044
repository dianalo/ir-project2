Wrapping up two days of closed-door deliberations on a$291 billion defense-authorization bill, lawmakers and aidessaid that the committee late yesterday agreed to buy fourmore radar-evading B-2s in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.One person who attended the meeting said that a &quot;surpriserevolt&quot; by a number of Republicans on the panel nearly killedthe B-2, and only Democratic support kept the plane alive.The Republicans apparently were angered by proposed cuts inanti-missile research.</LP><TEXT>   One package supported by the committee's leadershipenvisions boosting purchases to 12 or more planes a year by1994, but that proposal was rejected during the finaldeliberations.   Such unexpectedly hefty B-2 production, which calls forspending about $5 billion in fiscal 1992 and as much as $6.5billion in later years, would exceed the Pentagon's own plansfor the Northrop Corp.-built bomber and prompt vehementopposition on the Senate floor. B-2 proponents argue it's theonly way to reduce unit costs. Even without such acceleratedproduction, the committee's decision appears largely designedto counter an earlier House vote killing the program once the15 planes in the pipeline are completed.   Barring last-minute changes, major provisions of the billinclude:   -- More than $4 billion for anti-missile research on theStrategic Defense Initiative, 40% more than the Houseversion. But aides said the Senate committee is expected tofocus on ground-based research and delay development ofspace-based interceptors, dubbed Brilliant Pebbles, which arethe most controversial aspect of SDI. With conservativeRepublicans pushing hard for the White House's full SDIrequest and Democrats trying to find a compromise, thecommittee delayed a final vote on the issue until Tuesday.   -- Halting purchases of F-16 jet fighters for the AirForce this fall, two years earlier than the Pentagonproposed, and instead restarting production of F-117 Stealthfighters.   -- More than $4 billion to continue limited production oftwo other new Air Force planes: the Advanced Tactical Fighterand the C-17 transport.   This year's bill once again reflects the influence ofCommittee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga,), who managed to fashionbipartisan support for the Bush administration's priorities.Sen. Nunn, for instance, pushed for accelerated B-2production on the ground that political support for the $800million-a-copy plane is bound to erode the longer productioncontinues.   The chairman and his supporters also broke with the Houseby cutting deeply into reserve units, balking at allowingfemale pilots to fly combat missions, and refusing to sweetenPentagon spending plans to upgrade F-14 Navy jets.   After the full Senate votes on the bill, House and Senatenegotiators will reconcile their versions during lengthynegotiations. The Senate committee's authorization billidentifies which programs can be carried out and setsspending ceilings, while a separate appropriations bill willdetermine how much is spent on specific items.</TEXT></DOC>
