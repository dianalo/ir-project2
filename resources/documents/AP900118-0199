She was 33.   Her body was discovered late Thursday in a car in northeasternParis, said police, who called the death a suicide. There was noindication how long Ms. Le Guen had been in the car.   Ms. Le Guen descended into a cavern 260 feet underground on Aug.10, 1988, near Millau in southern France, equipped with 264 gallonsof water, 900 books and crates of canned and frozen foods.   She wore no watch and bore no other instrument to determine whattime or day it was or what was taking place above ground.   A pale but healthy Ms. Le Guen returned to the surface on Nov.29, 1988, eclipsing a 20-year-old record set by Josie Laures, whostayed underground for 88 days.   Ms. Le Guen had said her fondest memory during the ordeal wasreading ``One Hundred Years of Solitude,'' a bestselling book bythe Colombian author Gabriel Garcia Marquez.   She said she grew to like her damp surroundings and talked tostalactites. The only sound around her was that of dripping water,and her only contact with the outside world was a telephone.   ``The calls put into my ears the sounds of people living withoutme, in the free air,'' she said. ``I missed that and felt bad aboutit.''   Upon leaving the cave she said she felt the joy of beingreunited with her family and ``a poignant sadness at leaving thiscave which I'd become attached to after all.''   In a book on her experiences that was published last summer,``Alone at The Bottom of The Pit,'' she described the stressbrought about by the long isolation and her fear of sleeping and``staying in hibernation.''   No funeral service was immediately announced.</TEXT></DOC>
