Ms. Winkler said the flight attendants were happy to fly again,but were disappointed with wages at the airline, where most of theemployees do not belong to a union.   Houston-based Continental, a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., wasput under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1983 by Texas AirChairman Frank Lorenzo and later emerged as a non-union carrier.Lorenzo also put sister carrier Eastern Airlines under Chapter 11protection, and has been rebuilding Eastern without its unionssince they struck the airline in early March.   Ms. Winkler said most of the Continental attendants worked parttime or collected unemployment during their time off.   ``It's not all that different from the salary they weremaking,'' she said.   Starting flight attendants at Continental make about $14,000 ayear, with increases to $24,000 after six years on the job. Othermajor airlines offer similar starting salaries, but with highersalaries in the upper scales.   Under federal law, Continental was obligated to rehire thestriking workers before bringing any new flight attendants on board.   Officials said some of the 220 striking workers have left forother jobs, but about 160 will start retraining in Houston nextweek.   The rehired workers all will be flying out of Continental's hubin Newark, N.J.   Continental officials also said the rehired attendants canrequest transfers when they start work again.   Art Kent, a spokesman in Houston for Continental, said some ofthe striking attendants took early retirement or were fired forreasons not related to the strike shortly after the walkout. Hesaid the airline has identified 220 that took part in the strike.   ``A total of 162 are left of that 220. It appears all of themare accepting'' to be rehired, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
