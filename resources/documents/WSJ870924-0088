SchlesingerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GM F C HMC TOYOY NSANYAUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN><DATELINE> DETROIT  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Despite generous consumer incentives, mid-September U.S. auto sales dropped below analysts' expectations, reinforcing concerns that the 1987 car market may be weaker than originally forecast.    The seven major domestic auto makers sold 161,633 cars during Sept. 11-20, compared with 294,641 in the year-earlier period. Adjusting for the number of selling days -- eight this year vs. nine last year -- that marks a 38.3% fall.    No one expected sales this year to match last year's volume. Even though the terms of the current incentive campaign are better -- loans as low as 1.9% compared with a 2.9% floor last year -- the effect of such programs is wearing off.    But some analysts said they were disappointed at how little effect the current incentives seemed to have. On a seasonally adjusted annual basis, car sales were 7.2 million in the mid-September period, according to a U.S. Commerce Department formula. That was the same as in early September, and matches roughly what economists have been projecting for the whole year.    &quot;We expected a muted response to the sales incentives, but not quite this anemic,&quot; said Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. &quot;There is a possibility that consumer confidence has been tempered by the recent rise in the prime rate.&quot;    But the analysts stressed that they would have to see the late-September figures before drawing any definitive conclusions. Most of the inducements end next Wednesday, and consumers waiting until the last minute may rush into dealerships over the next week.    General Motors Corp., with the highest inventories of the Big Three auto makers, kicked off the current round of incentives Aug. 5. Early August sales rose to an 8.9 million annual rate, and mid-August sales shot up to a 10.3 million annual pace. Volume in late August was still unusually strong, but fell to a 7.9 million annual rate.    The discounts are still in place, but in September sales have averaged a 7.2 million annual rate -- the pace set the month before the current programs began, and the expected sales level for the full year.    Of the Big Three auto makers, Ford Motor Co. posted the smallest drop in the latest 10-day period. Its sales declined 31.2% from the year-earlier period, compared with a 43.1% drop for GM and a 51.4% slide for Chrysler Corp.    Some analysts suggested Ford's sales may be falling because it is running out of inventory. Chrysler's comparative sales were hurt because last year's total included the subcompact Omni/Horizon models, which were discontinued this year until recently.    While Chrysler's car sales dropped the sharpest of the domestic auto makers, its truck sales -- which make up about half of the company's U.S. vehicle sales -- held up the best. Domestically produced light truck sales dropped 6% to 19,329 vehicles in mid-September. GM's truck sales dropped 37% to 33,931. Ford's truck sales dropped 34% to 31,290.    ---                          Sep 11-20   Sep 11-20                               1987        1986     x% Chg GENERAL MOTORS Chevrolet ................. 30,895      53,392     - 34.9 Pontiac ................... 12,525      27,680     - 49.1 Oldsmobile ................ 15,148      39,952     - 57.3 Buick ..................... 15,000      23,018     - 26.7 Cadillac ................... 6,107      13,492     - 49.1 Total cars ................ 79,675     157,534     - 43.1 FORD Ford ...................... 31,053      51,391     - 32.0 Lincoln-Mercury ........... 16,175      25,833     - 29.6 Total cars ................ 47,228      77,224     - 31.2 CHRYSLER Chry-Plym ................. 13,800      29,142     - 46.7 Dodge ...................... 7,360      18,524     - 55.3 Eagle-e ...................... 550       2,580     - 76.0 Total cars ................ 21,710      50,246     - 51.4 VOLKSWAGEN Total cars ................. 1,281       2,092     - 31.1 HONDA Total cars ................. 5,553       5,550     + 12.6 NISSAN Total cars ................. 3,313       1,995     + 86.8 TOYOTA Total cars ................. 2,873           0 INDUSTRY TOTAL ........... 161,633     294,641     - 38.3   North American-made cars only.   e-Estimated.
