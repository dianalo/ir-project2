How could Jean-MarieLe Pen's National Front, the xenophobic party that wants tothrow foreign workers out of France, nearly outpoll theSocialist Party of France's president, Francois Mitterrand?   Has Mr. Le Pen's party changed, or have the Frenchthemselves?</LP><TEXT>   Maybe it's a little of both. Call it the Megret effect.   Bruno Megret is the chief strategist and No. 2 man in theNational Front, which years ago bumped along with less than1% of the French vote. Now polls show that one-third of theFrench agree with some of the party's ideas. In regionalelections yesterday, the Front won 14% of votes nationwideand well over 20% in some places, compared with just over 9%in the 1986 regional elections. The socialists, by contrast,saw their showing plunge from 30% in 1986 to about 19%yesterday. They were outpolled outright by the Front in areasthat included Paris.   Such showings could propel the Front into several regionalgovernments as coalition partners of conservative parties,which did best in yesterday's election but also saw theirshare of the vote drop. And it could help the Front in nextyear's national elections for parliament.   &quot;The stronger we are, the more we'll be respected,&quot; saysMr. Megret.   Mr. Megret has played a key role in broadening the Front'sappeal, and he has done so by projecting two distinct faces.One of those is of the unassuming, babyfaced party technocratwho discusses the Front's investment policies with businessexecutives. &quot;I am a serious, responsible person,&quot; Mr. Megretsays softly.   The second is that of the man who strides aggressivelyinto halls crowded with sympathizers to bark out the Front'sdoctrine of racial venom. He speaks of a world-wide&quot;cosmopolitan&quot; conspiracy that seeks to abolish nationalidentity and infect the world with the AIDS virus. He saysracial integration has corrupted the U.S. and he mocks thosein French politics with Jewish-sounding names.   Then, as spotlights glare, he demands that France halt theconstruction of all mosques in the country, that foreignersbe forced to take medical tests before entering France, andthat boats be chartered to carry immigrants in the countryaway. Each proposal wins thunderous applause.   &quot;Who took jobs from the French?&quot; he shouts. &quot;An invasionof foreigners.&quot; The Front is the only party &quot;with the courageto do what needs to be done.&quot;   Less known and less flamboyant than Mr. Le Pen, Mr. Megretis viewed by detractors as one of the most dangerous men inFrench politics. The reason: He is a master at concealing hisextremism behind a facade of respectability -- and he hasremade the National Front with a similar double-identity. &quot;Hehas a touch of Goebbels,&quot; charges Alain Rollat, a politicalcorrespondent for Le Monde.   In particular, he has sought to couch the party's harshnationalism in a populist plan of action. Outside thegatherings of his supporters, talk of social issues largelysupplants racist jibes. His core message is consistent,however: There is a cause-and-effect link, he says, betweenthe nation's estimated four million immigrants and its risingrate of unemployment, which stands at about 10%, or threemillion people.   For all of its success in yesterday's elections, the Fronthasn't completely burnished its image. Opinion surveys showthat 65% of French people still see it as a threat todemocracy. Still, the party is now largely setting thepolitical agenda in France. It has forced all the establishedparties to confront the divisive issue of immigration, atopic other European nations are wrestling with too. And ithas set all sides buzzing with talk of &quot;national values&quot; andother Front phrases.   &quot;Over the past three years we have won a big ideologicalvictory. We have managed to impose our vocabulary,&quot; saysDamien Bariller, an aide to Mr. Megret. Guy Birenbaum, apolitical scientist who has written a critical study of theparty, concurs: &quot;The only thing people are talking about isthe National Front. It's exactly what Megret wanted.&quot;   A day spent with Mr. Megret just before the voting showshow the 20-year-old Front is feeding on French malaise.   One morning in Marseille, Mr. Megret gets off the earlyplane from Paris, dressed in a dapper tweed jacket, blueshirt and striped tie. First stop is a 90-acre apple farm inCavaillon belonging to Lucien Gros. A portly farmer withwhite hair, Mr. Gros greets him warmly at the gate, which isfestooned with a National Front poster declaring, &quot;Theyprefer foreigners, we defend the French.&quot;   Mr. Gros has been an ardent Front activist since the early1980s, when labor unions picketed his farm. They said he wasforcing his apple pickers, who came from Morocco, to live inpoor conditions, sometimes without pay. The Front jumped onthe issue, organizing a pro-Gros demonstration andinstructing its lawyers to challenge labor's protest incourt.   Mr. Megret climbs on some upturned crates to give his twodozen listeners a brief pep talk. What Mr. Gros livedthrough, he declares, &quot;shows what the National Front can dofor people who are victims of immigration.&quot;   Back in his chauffeur-driven car, Mr. Megret denies hiscritics' charge of fascism. The Front, he suggests, hassimply inherited the values of Gaullism.   But the values Mr. Megret talks of are more akin to theparanoia of white supremacism than to the patriotism ofCharles De Gaulle. The Front's Mr. Le Pen caused a furor in1987 when, appearing in a TV interview, he dismissed the NaziHolocaust as &quot;a detail of history.&quot; Several publicationsassociated with the Front regularly rail abusively at Jews aswell as at Arabs and other foreigners: A recent issue of anewsletter Mr. Megret helps put out talks of &quot;aninternational Jewish masonic&quot; lobby that supposedly hasinfiltrated France and is manipulating public opinion againstthe Front.   Then there's his theory of cosmopolitanism. &quot;America has abig problem with cosmopolitanism, with the melting pot,&quot; hecontends. People of European origin could live together inharmony, he says. &quot;But with Hispanics, blacks and Asians, Iexpect a grave crisis.&quot;   His view of America is partly personal. After graduatingfrom France's top school for engineers, he spent a year atthe University of California at Berkeley in 1975, studyingfor a master's degree in science. He says he was surprised tofind that Americans are so tolerant. But &quot;a year there wasenough.&quot;   He later worked as a civil servant in the administrationof President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and ran as a mainstreamconservative candidate in the 1981 parliamentary elections.He lost. In 1984, he joined the National Front.   Mr. Megret's most recent role has been to elaborate on theFront's scorn for immigrants, especially Arabs from NorthernAfrica, by constructing its range of policy proposals thatdiscriminate against foreigners living in France. But at alunchtime speaking engagement in the village of St. Remy deProvence, Mr. Megret deliberately avoids the issue.   About 100 people have turned up to listen in a hall deckedwith posters warning that France &quot;will be an Islamic republicin 20 years.&quot; Mr. Megret focuses on the plight of Frenchfarmers, saying they have been driven &quot;to the verge ofbankruptcy by technocrats in Brussels working with thecomplicity of our politicians.&quot;   Back in his car, Mr. Megret explains why he didn't mentionimmigrants. &quot;We are trying to show we are a party ofgovernment. People know our position on immigration. It'simportant to talk about other things,&quot; he says.   Mr. Megret's lunchtime discourse has appealed strongly toAndre Melin, a well-educated computer engineer in his 50s.Like many recent converts to the Front, he seems typicallymiddle class, and unlike the motley group of skinheads andneo-fascists the party initially attracted. &quot;Immigration is aproblem in France, but it's only a secondary one.&quot; he says.&quot;The main problem is a loss of French identity.&quot;   France's commitment to a united Europe, he frets, willjust hand control over French affairs to bureaucrats inBrussels. And he believes Arab immigrants are changing thenation's character. The Front, Mr. Melin says, &quot;is helping usrediscover our national and Christian roots.&quot;   Similarly, the Fabres, a couple in their early 30s withfive children, like what the Front says about preservingvalues such as family life. &quot;I know they sometimes say badthings, but I still want them to govern France,&quot; says PatrickFabre, 34, who works in the military. &quot;Le Pen is cultured,intelligent and has good people around him. Only the Fronthas the courage to say what is wrong with France.&quot;   During the afternoon, Mr. Megret continues his moderateline, pitching the Front's social agenda to executives from alocal construction company. They seem impressed by his style,but not by his views on immigration. The foreigners the Frontwants to deport, they say, do unskilled labor many Frenchwon't touch, even if they're out of work.   Back in the Marseille headquarters of the Front, Mr.Megret polishes a speech before setting out for a rally ofparty activists in Aix-en-Provence. He arrives at the rallyat 9 p.m. and is whisked past a cordon of tough Frontbodyguards wearing helmets and wielding truncheons. Thelights go down in the hall, and the 500-strong audiencebreaks into rhythmic clapping as Mr. Megret strides towardthe rostrum, flashing a victory sign. No longer does he needto watch his words. He's among die-hard Front loyalists.   He launches into an hour-long tirade against immigrants.Foreigners must be thrown out, he says. And, to keep Franceracially pure, French women should stop working and have morechildren. Finally, exhausted and bathed in sweat, he raiseshis voice in triumph. &quot;We are emerging as the movement thatwill govern France,&quot; he says, as the cheering crowd rises tosing the French national anthem. &quot;The National Front willprevail.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
