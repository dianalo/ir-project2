From an initialcore of deterministic safety philosophy developed across the Atlantic,which has been wholly retained and in some instances refined, a rangeof additions has been made which enhance the overall level of safetyof the installations without undue complication. This paper describesthe culmination of this work, as exemplified in the new 1 400 MWe plantseries currently under construction, of which the essential elementsare also incorporated into all previous units, thereby giving them anequivalent level of safety. This now constitutes EDF's safety policywith respect to PWR nuclear units. This approach is explained in moredetail in the EDF's ''White book for PWR Nuclear Safety''.</TEXT></DOC>
