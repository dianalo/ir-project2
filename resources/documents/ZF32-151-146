(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Many computer users already work on personal computers and workstations withhigh-resolution color monitors and color graphics capabilities.andP;  The irony isthat few of these users have a means of transferring the bright, sparklingcolors lighting up their display screens onto paper.andM;Most color printers attach directly to a single PC or workstation, despitethe high cost of such arrangements.andP;  It will likely be several years befofepowerful data compression software will be combined with high-volume colorprinters residing on the network to bring truly affordable hardcopy color tocomputer users at large.andM;It will be two to three years before color printers attain theprice/performance requirements necessary to push them beyond their currentmarket niches.andP;  At the same time, networked color printers that can operateat speeds comparable to their black-and-white brethren could be as much asfive to seven years away.andM;The key technological issue for developing network-based color printers isthe creation of a standard for color graphics data compression, which willfacilitate the transfer of graphics applications across the network withoutlogging the network's bandwidth.andP;  (See &quot;Compressing data to increase speed,&quot;page 27.)andM;In addition, without support for data compression, the print buffer of mostcolor printers would easily be overrun, meaning that any jobs sent over thenetwork would be lost unless the printer has a tremendous amount of localstorage--and that can get expensive.andM;The most widespread use of color printers so far has been for graphics thataccompany presentations to managers or customers.andP;  Other principal uses ofcolor printers include proofing the color pages of books, pamphlets andnewspapers before the pages go to press, and distinguishing functions throughcolor in CAD/CAM work.andP;  Color printers also have found use in operations like3-D imaging and shading and medical imaging.andM;Typically, these jobs involve one printer attached to one computer, or at themost to a small work group of computers.andP;  But as color comes into wider use,these printer-per-user arrangements will not be cost-effective.andM;LEARNING TO SHAREandM;Color printers are ideal candidates for peripheral sharing on a networkbecause their high prices make a 1-1 ratio between user and printercost-prohibitive.andP;  Although color printer costs are coming down, it'sunlikely they'll ever be as inexpensive as black-and-white PostScript laserprinters, the devices that whetted the public's appetite for high-qualityprinter output.andM;Three types of color printer technology are in use now.andM;Color laser printers, which require multiple passes to produce color images,cost as much as $30,000.andP;  (See &quot;The cost of color,&quot; above.)andP;  The laser printengine makes as many as four passes, laying down a different color of tonereach time (from a palette consisting of the printer colors cyan, magenta,yellow and black, called the CMYK model).andP;  Different proportions of each typeof toner are used to produce various color tones.andM;Color thermal transfer printers, the second and substantially less-expensiveapproach, range from about $6,000 to $8,000.andP;  The thermal transfer techniqueuses heat to alter the color of chemically treated printing paper.andM;The third method is inkjet color printing, which is much slower than theother two methods and costs about $8,000 for a high-resolution printer.andO;Inkjets squirt minischule droplets of metal-based ink toward the paper, whilemagnets surrounding the stream control the direction of flow.andM;A two-volume report entitled &quot;Network printing and printing on networks&quot;concludes that although many color printer vendors are prepared to supportTCP/IP and Ethernet, these are merely strategies for connecting printers tonetworks.andP;  The report was written by Michael Weiss of MWA Consulting, aconsulting company in Palo Alto, Calif., and published this year by anotherconsulting company, Bis Strategic Decisions of Norwell, Mass.andM;In order to provide color printers that can easily support multiple networkedusers, such printers should, first of all, be able to churn out at least 12pages per minute.andP;  Second, this performance should be coupled withpaper-handling facilities capable of carrying the load, such as 500-sheetinput and output trays.andP;  Reliability is another critical shared-printerfactor, calling for a minimum duty cycle of 30,000 pages per month.andM;Unfortunately, color printers have yet to catch up with black-and-whiteprinters to achieve these minimum requirements.andM;Color printers fast enough to support full-fledged networked printingrequirements could be years away.andP;  laser printers and laser-type printers arelikely to be the fastest, but top-of-the-line color printers still strugglealong at a lowly five pages per minute.andP;  Such printers achieve that speed bybuilding a color image on an intermediate surface in four passes, and thentransferring the image to paper in one step.andM;Slow print speeds won't prevent color printers from appearing on computernetworks, but it does mean the color hard-copy devices won't be the onlyprinters on the network.andM;Color printers will be reserved for special jobs, such as CAD and the finalversions of presentation graphics, whereas heavy-volume work, such asreports, memos, draft copies of color output and the like, will continue tobe sent to the monochrome printer workhorses.andM;Hefty price tags will also limit the deployment of fast color printers, evenif they're shared on a network.andP;  Angele Boyd, a printer industry analyst atInternational Data Corp. (IDC), a market research company in Framingham,Mass., said that even projecting a 20 percent annual rate of price decline,color printers won't hit the competitive $10,000 mark for at least fiveyears.andP;  (See &quot;Declining cost of color laser printers,&quot; page 27).andM;WAITING GAMEandM;The distinction between color and black-and-white print services derivesmainly from the volume of data and variety of problems the two types of printservers must handle.andM;Besides needing to handle the large amount of data that a color print jobentails, color print servers must also deal with two other issues: datacompression and color matching.andM;According to industry analysts, no products on the market right now provideall the ingredients required of a truly effective color print server.andP;  IDC'sBoyd said that neither network vendors such as Novell nor printer vendors aredoing much for the cause of networked printing.andM;&quot;The role of pulling together and managing the myriad printing resources onthe LAN is destined to fall to entrepreneurial third-party companies,&quot; Boydsaid.andM;Boyd cited Insight Development of Emeryville, Calif., and the print serversoftware it introduced early this year, called Mosaic, as an attempt to solvehigh-volume network printer problems.andM;A sophisticated utility that allows users to access shared printers, Mosaiccan function transparently to end users (for example, by providing Chooserprinter options for Mac users) or can be accessed directly by users who wantto utilize the software's more advanced features.andM;&quot;A print server can't solve all the problems that exist today relevant toprinting on a network, but Mosaic is moving in the right direction,&quot; Boydsaid.andM;In January, Insight introduced Mosaic for Macintosh computers running onNovell NetWare LANs.andP;  In February, the company began offering a version ofMosaic for PC AT users on NetWare LANs.andP;  Mosaic for macintosh runs on amacintosh with 1MB of memory, whereas Mosaic for PCs runs on an IBM PC AT orcompatible computer with 640KB of RAM and a 20MB hard disk.andM;Mosaic maintains data on the characteristics of each printer on the network.andO;Users send their print jobs to the printer they believe to have theappropriate corresponding characteristics.andP;  if users are mistaken, or if theprinter's characteristics have changed, Mosaic sends the print job to its&quot;mismatch queue&quot; and notifies users so they can make the proper adjustments.andM;Users can also instruct Mosaic to find the right printer for a job instead ofdesignating a printer on their own.andP;  Mosaic keeps track of what fonts are onwhat printer, for example, and of other features--such as the ability to doduplex printing--and matches the job to the printer.andM;Mosaic residing on the macintosh or the PC AT is an example of one method ofnetworking printers: putting a PC or workstation on the network and arming itwith multiuser printer management software.andP;  Another method is to build thecompression capability into the printer itself.andP;  The color printers inTektronix's 4693 line are a good example; they support TCP/IP.andM;CENTRALIZATION VS.andP;  DISTRIBUTIONandM;There are arguments in favor of both methods.andP;  The print server withmultisuer software is considered best-suited for providing the user withbidirectional control.andP;  But according to Chris Smith, Tektronix's marketdevelopment manager, putting the software in the printer brings an element offlexibility that server software alone can't provide.andM;&quot;If somebody came along with a great compression algorithm built into VMSprint servers, we would be able to make use of that in the VMS environment,&quot;Smith said.andP;  &quot;But in the Unix environment, I would have no solution.andP;  But ifI put a compression algorithm in the printer, then regardless of how Iconnect the printer to the environment, I have the ability in that printer todo compression.&quot;andM;It would also be desirable for some publishing applications to achievescreen-to-paper color fidelity.andP;  Industry analysts expect color printes to dono better than provide fidelity on the &quot;sky is blue, grass is green&quot;level--that is, printers may get the color family right, but they areunlikely to be able to match the desired shade.andM;Part of the problem with color fidelity is that monitors from differentvendors display different colors from the same file information.andP;  Evenmonitors developed by the same vendor display colors differently as themonitors age.andM;&quot;For color on networks, WYSIWYG has become WYSIWYW, or 'What you see is whatyou want,'&quot; MWA Consulting's Weiss said.andP;  Designing a printer that canfaithfully reproduce such color differentces is a task of herculeandimensions.andM;In addition, the color-creation methods employed by monitors and printers arequite different, which makes matching screen and printer colors all the moredifficult.andP;  The CRT at the heart of most monitor screens depends on threecolor &quot;guns&quot; to create shades and hues using different combinations of thecolors red, green and blue (hence the RGB designation for most colormonitors).andM;To display colors, RGB monitors must receive data in which the red, green andblue components of each pixel in a given image are assigned a number, usuallyan integer between ) and 255.andP;  In the CRT, these numbers are converted intovoltages proportional to the number, producing different hues on the monitorscreen.andM;However, when putting color on a page, printers follow the CMYK model,combining those four process color inks in different proportions to producedifferent colors.andM;Display screen-to-paper color matching thus requires a two-step process suchas that performed by PostScript Level 2 from Adobe Systems of Mountain View,Calif.andP;  PostScript Level 2 uses RGB as the internal representation of color,but supports CMYK for hard-copy output.andM;Even when employing a matching algorithm as in PostScript Level 2, colorprinters often fail to produce the expected colors because inks and papersvary in quality.andP;  For example, a combination of pure cyan, magenta and yellowshould produce a solid black.andP;  But in reality, it produces a muddy brown, duein part to impure color pigments.andM;Nevertheless, what users have said they want is industry-standard colormapping to achieve device-independent color.andP;  This standard is cominggradually from the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE), aninternational standards organization based in Paris that has developed amodel for defining device-independent color based on how humans see color.andO;CIE establishes a &quot;standard observer&quot; as the model rather than a particularoutput device.andM;Adobe's PostScript Level 2 supports CIE's latest color-conversion model,known as CIElab, in that the RGB model on the monitor screen is transferredto the CMYK of the page according to the CIE model.andM;Complicating the color model issue, Eastman Kodak supports its own variant ofthe RGB model, called Photo YCC.andP;  But analysts believe it will be easy toconvert between RGB and Photo YCC.andP;  In fact, Adobe has included support forPhoto YCC as well as CIElab in PostScript Level 2.andM;COLOR JOB PENDING AGAIN?andM;Even as color printers become less expensive and incorporateperformance-enhancing features such as data compression, speedyblack-and-white printers will inevitably remain the workhorses of networkedbusiness computing environments.andM;Most users will send draft versions of presentation graphics and textdocuments to black-and-white printers, and turn to color printers primarilyto produce final presentation-quality versions.andM;Like color terminals, color printers may function for some time asprestigious rather than proletarian devices.andP;  Still, color printers haveinvariably proven popular at VAX sites.andP;  Because one-color-printer-peruserconfigurations are prohibitively expensive for most sites, the pressure is onfor vendors to produce color printers with improved network printingcapabilities.andP;  The end is already clearly justified; it's the means thatremain stubbornly elusive.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
