Apartheid's social engineers reckoned that every town had at least one hill or mine dump or clump of trees to separate the races. Most towns did. But not Koster. Here, 90 miles northwest of Johannesburg, the blacks lived right next to the whites, with only a field of tall weeds providing a token barrier.    Until now. After all these years, Koster has finally found its hill. The blacks, many of whom have owned their houses for decades, are being moved a bit farther down the road, which slopes nicely into a valley. That will put another half-mile of weeds and a clear horizon between them and the whites.    &quot;They tell us we're too close,&quot; says Ismail Modise, who heads a residents' committee fighting the move. &quot;We've been here since 1929, and now we're too close? What's happening here?&quot;    What's happening here is the same thing that is happening in rural and blue-collar areas across the country: Right-wing zealots, rallying to the pro-apartheid call of the Conservative Party, are demanding strict segregation, and in some places that demand translates into relocation. Koster officials say the relocation here is motivated by a desire to &quot;upgrade&quot; their 5,000 black neighbors by giving them new brick houses, smooth streets, a soccer stadium and their very own beer hall. But in the evolving terminology of apartheid, &quot;upgrade&quot; is just a nice way of saying &quot;to each his own&quot; or &quot;out of sight, out of mind.&quot;    &quot;We need a buffer area for the same reason every other town has one,&quot; says Braam Berg, Koster's town clerk. &quot;The blacks' standard of living isn't the same as ours. Their culture isn't the same.&quot;    Thus, in the year marking its 75th anniversary, Koster is rushing ahead to the past. &quot;What is being done represents classic, crude apartheid at work,&quot; says Alan Morris, a member of the Transvaal Rural Action Committee, a mostly white group that helps blacks resist removals. &quot;This is what went on in the 1950s.&quot;    Until the Conservative Party started gaining momentum a few years ago, the black and white starkness of the 1950s was beginning to blur. Shifting population and labor patterns, coupled with the government's program of gradual political and social change, eroded some aspects of apartheid, particularly the segregation of residential areas according to race. In the country's largest cities, so-called gray areas have developed where blacks, Indians, coloreds (people of mixed race) and whites share a neighborhood. Beaches have become desegregated, too, as have many workplaces, restaurants, theaters and parks.    But the 1,200 whites of Koster will have none of this. Although the white town council is currently controlled by the ruling National Party, the Conservative Party is expected to mount a strong challenge in the municipal election this October. Last May, the Conservatives captured the local parliamentary seat as well as two dozen others nationwide to oust the liberal Progressive Federal Party as the official white opposition. Accentuating this swing to the right is the rising popularity of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, or AWB, a movement of white supremacists who often carry guns in public, wave a symbol resembling the Nazi swastika and threaten to put blacks in their place.    In Koster, that place is a half-mile farther down the road.    It's not that the blacks haven't been nice neighbors. &quot;No, can't say we've ever had much trouble,&quot; says a white man whose house sits no more than a football field away from the old black area. From his garden bench, which once was a bathtub, he can see the roofs of the blacks' houses and smell the smoke of their chimneys. &quot;They get a little noisy now and then,&quot; he says, &quot;but that's about it.&quot;    It's just that, well, &quot;they're different,&quot; says Hans Heymans, a young farmer and AWB supporter, taking a break from baking &quot;Boerebrood&quot; (farmers' bread) at a town picnic. &quot;They aren't on the same level as us; they aren't as developed,&quot; Mr. Heymans says. &quot;In the United States, you don't understand. Your blacks are more cultured and educated, just like the whites. Our blacks aren't.&quot; He points in the direction of Koster's black settlement. &quot;It's like having a different culture just across the road.&quot;    The road, named West Street, is a narrow strip of red gravel. It is like the proverbial railroad tracks in America that separate the rich side of town from the poor. The physical distance may not be great, but the mental gap is.    The whites of Koster rarely cross West Street except to conduct business or take their maids home. The blacks weren't invited to the town picnic, or at least none went. In fact, few of the blacks even knew about the town's 75th-anniversary festivities. One black resident says the whites have never tried to hide their displeasure over the fact that visitors approaching town from the north see the black area first.    &quot;They complain that this just isn't right,&quot; he says.    This isn't an unusual complaint in South Africa, which is why few people, beyond some civil-rights organizations, are up in arms about the Koster relocation. Fifty miles east of Koster, whites in the town of Brits have similarly complained that the blacks in the adjacent township of Oukasie are too close to them. So for two years, government officials have been trying to &quot;upgrade&quot; the black residents by moving them 12 miles down the road to a new black township of Lethlabile. When some of the blacks resisted, the authorities &quot;disestablished&quot; Oukasie, meaning that as far as the bureaucrats are concerned, it no longer exists. In the face of continuing resistance, the government now indicates that, for the moment at least, it won't force the issue.    In Koster, about one-third of the blacks have moved down the hill, particularly government employees like teachers, policemen and railroad workers who generally find it easier to get loans. In the new place, they can buy their own plot of land and build their own house -- in the old place, they could own the house but not the plot it sat on -- and if they have enough money, they can even install indoor plumbing and electricity. They will be truly upgraded.    But their poorer neighbors -- the laborers, the unemployed and the retired, who make up much of the population -- will have to move into three-room or four-room brick houses with no electricity and an outhouse out back. For these people, life is better in the old location. Up there, no one has electricity or indoor toilets either, but the houses for the most part are big -- six or seven rooms, even 10 in some cases -- and well-built. Once the people move, these houses will be destroyed.    Esther Morake, a 92-year-old widow, was one of the first to move because she was led to believe that if she didn't go right away, there wouldn't be any space left for her. One day she sits crying on a sofa in her four-room house, thinking of the seven-room home she left behind. The old place was nicely furnished and airy, with a fine porch and leafy trees out front. The new place is cramped and hot, with just a little stoop and a tree that is so small it won't provide much shade for many years.    Unable to jam seven rooms of furniture into four, Mrs. Morake has had to leave a stove, some tables and a couple of cabinets in a shack out back. She is paying about $10 a month for rent and services, the same as before, but here the tin roof leaks. &quot;I wish I hadn't moved,&quot; she says. &quot;If only I could go back.&quot; But she can't, for the other day a bulldozer demolished half of the old place.    &quot;I'm not going anywhere,&quot; vows the 66-year-old Mr. Modise, the head of the residents' committee, while giving a visitor a tour of his seven-room house. All of the rooms are abundantly furnished, particularly the living room, which has a stereo system that runs on a car battery. Mr. Modise, too, has a porch, from which he watches the destruction of his neighborhood.    He says his house has been appraised at 5,000 rand -- the equivalent of about $2,350 -- so that is what he would be paid if he moved. For that sum he could barely afford one of the smaller brick houses, which are going for about 4,800 rand without plastered walls or a fence. His residents' committee is trying to get a court order halting the removal.    &quot;If it's upgrading they want to do, they don't need to move us. They can upgrade right here,&quot; he says. &quot;They can pave the roads and put up outdoor lights. They can give us water in the houses.&quot;    The mayor of the black community, Jonathan Marota, says Mr. Modise and his residents' committee are standing in the way of progress. &quot;When the people move down here, they are starting a new life,&quot; says Mr. Marota, who is the principal of the black primary school. &quot;They can buy their own property and give their children a future.&quot;    The white town council is counting on the mayor to persuade all the other blacks to move. To set an example, Mr. Marota, who had ready access to financing, recently moved into his new 48,000-rand house. It is one of the finest in the area, complete with running water, flush toilets and electricity. &quot;Anyone who wants to develop themselves will come down here,&quot; he says.    Such testimonials have put Mr. Marota in good stead with the white folks on top of the hill. But not that good. When the white town council was planning the anniversary festivities, Mr. Marota expected that he would receive an invitation to participate. He was sorely disappointed.    &quot;I don't know why I wasn't invited,&quot; he says. &quot;I work closely with the white council.&quot; Obviously wounded by the snub, he adds: &quot;I know when I'm not wanted.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
