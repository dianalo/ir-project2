He spoke to big audiences in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban, and to small ones at many places in between. He even took his campaign to Washington and to the capitals of Europe. His message was always the same: to South Africa's black majority, the elections are a side-show. The voteless, he said, will voice their opinions by defying the country's apartheid, or segregation, laws and state of emergency restrictions in the weeks leading up to the elections. It is the defiance campaign, not the election campaign, that counts, he told an anti-election rally at Johannesburg's city hall on Aug. 21.    Ten days later, Mr. Ndlovu, the national chairman of the anti-apartheid United Democratic Front, was arrested under the goverment's emergency regulations amid a nationwide clampdown on the defiance activities. His campaigning was over, but the white politicians continued apace, shielded by a vow from the police that anti-apartheid activists, like Mr. Ndlovu, wouldn't be allowed to disrupt &quot;the democratic process of elections.&quot;    And so white voters, as well as Indians and coloreds, as people of mixed-race are called, who have their own separate chambers of parliament, will indeed exercise their democratic right to vote today. But as they do, South Africa's central irony, and greatest dilemma, is magnified: The government can't uphold democracy without subverting it at the same time. To ensure a democratic election for the minority, it outlaws the democratic protests of the majority.    According to the South African Human Rights Commission, an anti-apartheid watchdog organization, nearly 2,000 people have been arrested since the beginning of August for participating in defiance campaigns and anti-election protests. At least 14 meetings were banned and two were restricted in terms of what could be said. At least 46 meetings and protest gatherings were broken up by security forces; 28 involved the use of force, such as tear gas, water cannons, rubber bullets and whips. Seventy-four journalists were arrested, either for protesting emergency press restrictions or for violating those restrictions by refusing to turn their backs on police actions. Several churches were surrounded, and effectively closed, by police to prevent anti-apartheid gatherings.    All of this has put the country's 28 million blacks at the center of the election campaign, even though they are sidelined on election day. The Mass Democratic Movement, a coalition of anti-apartheid groups organizing the defiance activities, has been mentioned so frequently by the white candidates that MDM, as it is commonly called, has become a household name.    The ruling National Party and the far-right Conservative Party claim that MDM is a front for the banned African National Congress and South African Communist Party, and that its defiance activities, like swimming on whites-only beaches and riding on whites-only buses, are designed to provoke confrontations with the police. While condemning the violence, the liberal Democratic Party says MDM reflects the frustrations of the black majority.    &quot;Protest is inevitable when normal political activity isn't possible, and in particular when it is forbidden, as is the case with the MDM,&quot; says Wynand Malan, a leader of the Democratic Party.    Thus, while acting President F.W. de Klerk closed the National Party's campaign Monday night, saying &quot;discrimination must be eliminated; there is no other alternative,&quot; members of the country's largest black trade union federation marched nearby to kick off a two-day general strike.    'We believe that {the strike} is the real election,&quot; said Cyril Ramaphosa, the head of the National Union of Mineworkers, who was leading the demonstration. &quot;That is how our people are casting their vote.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
