United News of Bangladesh said bus drivers and other employeesof the country's public transportation system did not show up forwork and that many car owners stayed off the roads for fear ofviolence.   An umbrella group of more than 20 trade unions sponsored by thecountry's leading opposition parties called the strike.   The workers demanded that their monthly wages be increased fromabout $25 a month to $44. They also sought a cost-of-livingallowance equal to 60 percent of their salaries to compensate forinflation since their last raises four years ago.   The workers have rejected a government offer of a 10 percentcost-of-living allowance that was scheduled to begin in July.   The government puts the inflation rate at 14 percent, but manyeconomists believe it rose past 20 percent late last year.   Nirmal Sen, a spokesman for the unions, said the strike includedfactory workers, transportation employees and shop workers.   He said the strike was successful in industrial areas outsideDhaka, but there was no independent confirmation.   Police were stationed in front of government offices to guardagainst violence. Some groups of workers marched through thecapital's commercial district, but there were no confrontationswith police, witnesses said.</TEXT></DOC>
