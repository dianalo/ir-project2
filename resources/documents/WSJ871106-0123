Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was derided by satirists here as Ronald Reagan's &quot;poodle&quot; when in April 1986 she allowed U.S. planes to launch their attack on Libya from British air bases. While her international moniker has been &quot;Iron Lady,&quot; here at home critics have cast her as America's faithful lap dog.    But she is now impatient with the Reagan administration because she believes the global financial crash -- and the ensuing uncertainty in financial markets -- threatens everything she has worked for in her eight years as prime minister. Yesterday in Parliament, she criticized American economic policy, saying she is &quot;very anxious&quot; for deficit-reduction negotiations between the president and Congress to succeed. &quot;A convincing package to reduce the U.S. budget deficit is a vital first step towards restoring confidence in the financial markets,&quot; she said. The blunt public admonition followed a private message sent Wednesday to President Reagan.    After years of tough -- and politically unpopular -- retrenchment, Britain's economy is growing smartly. But if the current market turmoil continues -- and many analysts believe it will unless the U.S. slashes its budget deficit -- then Britain could be dragged into a world recession.    Mrs. Thatcher isn't without some influence over her pal, Ronald Reagan. The two have a mutual admiration society where most aspects of economic policy are concerned. But American officials aren't likely suddenly to clean up their economic mess just because Britain's prime minister has spoken. Her comments, and the more pointed statements of other British officials, instead show how peeved Britons are with American policy makers.    This isn't the first time Mrs. Thatcher, who considers herself President Reagan's friendliest ally, has tried to budge U.S. policy. After last year's Reykjavik summit, she took credit for persuading Mr. Reagan to drop the idea that all nuclear ballistic missiles should be scrapped over the next decade. In 1984, British newspapers congratulated her for supposedly securing the U.S. president's agreement that production and deployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative anti-missile defense system would be a matter for negotiation.    Whether any of that credit was deserved is debatable. Domestic political pressure would have forced Mr. Reagan to drop the 10-year timetable for eliminating the nuclear missiles; and Mr. Reagan continues to hang tough on SDI.    The same holds true on the world economy. Mrs. Thatcher &quot;thinks she's got much more influence than she has; that's been a British failing for 45 years,&quot; says Susan Strange, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. &quot;The really important people now are the Germans and the Japanese.&quot;    Still, Mrs. Thatcher -- and almost everyone else here -- is voicing increasing irritation with the Americans for having spoiled Britain's party.    Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told a banquet of bankers and brokers Wednesday the &quot;dangers to the world economy&quot; from &quot;massive trade imbalances&quot; have been apparent for years. &quot;At the heart of this problem lay the huge budget&quot; deficit in the U.S., he said.    Of course the Germans and Japanese take some bashing here for failing to reflate their economies and help correct international trade imbalances. But the U.S. is seen as the main villain, particularly as the Reagan administration and Congress haven't yet announced how they will cut the budget deficit beyond the $23 billion mandated by law. Achieving those cuts &quot;has now become the touchstone of whether the United States has the political will to make hard choices and to do what needs to be done,&quot; Mr. Lawson said at the banquet.    Mixed with Britons' irritation is a lot of smugness. British commentators now claim a distinction between &quot;Reaganomics&quot; and &quot;Thatcherite economics.&quot; Both policies embraced lower direct taxes and a tighter money supply. But whereas Britain insisted on financing these with lower government outlays, spending in the U.S. soared as Congress refused to cut welfare and the president held firm on defense. The ultimate result was the huge budget deficit and plummeting dollar that threaten to plunge the U.S. into a recession.    Mrs. Thatcher stressed these criticisms of the U.S. in Parliament last week. The Labor Party, she said, has &quot;been urging us to follow the deficit policy of the U.S. Only now are they {Labor members of Parliament} beginning to realize that the policy of sound money has kept this country prosperous.&quot;    Even a deputy foreign secretary felt qualified to lecture U.S. businessmen on economic policy. Lynda Chalker told a Chamber of Commerce luncheon in London this week that Britain's economy is strong because &quot;we reduced government borrowing, and then taxes. I hope an American audience will forgive me for saying that this still seems to be the right order in which to tackle the two problems.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
