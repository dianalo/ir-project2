(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A divorced man who defied a principal'sprohibition against escorting a high school student to her prom waspromptly arrested on trespassing charges after arriving with hisdate Friday.   Troy Cripps III, dressed in a black tuxedo, was taken intocustody at the Dekalb County High School prom after arriving with18-year-old Tammy Sliger, said Dekalb County sheriff's Deputy SteveJohnson.   Cripps, 23, was freed on $250 bond, Johnson said. He wasscheduled to appear in court May 25.   Circuit Court Judge John Maddux had ruled earlier Friday thatthe school board and Principal Ernest Ray could bar Cripps fromescorting Sliger to the dance.   Ray had barred four divorced men from the prom after receivingan anonymous letter threatening ``trouble'' if they were allowed toattend, said school Superintendent Aubrey Turner.   ``We felt that it was probably from one of the divorced wives,saying they didn't feel the school should let this type of thingoccur,'' he said. ``There was a threat as far as just causing adisturbance.''   Sliger and Laura Lea Cooper, 17, asked the court for arestraining order, arguing that that school officials werediscriminating against their dates because of age and maritalstatus, said Carolyn Todd, Sliger's mother.   ``She's just crushed and her feelings were hurt so bad,'' Mrs.Todd said after the court ruling.   Turner conceded that the fact that the four men were divorcedmay have disturbed some school officials.   ``I can't say that that wasn't a factor, that might be asecondary factor because that gets into morals,'' he said. ``Theprimary factor was that there might be some problems, we have toensure a safe environment for their prom.''   Mrs. Todd said that divorced people had been allowed to attendthe prom in the past and that school officials overreacted to theanonymous letter.   ``If they can keep people from going to the prom, then they cankeep people who write a threatening letter from coming into theprom,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
