What he has been campaigning for in the presidential electionsApril 24 is a ``French France.''   The first man to announce his candidacy, Le Pen has beenpounding out that message for a year.   As the balloting draws nearer, Le Pen's message is being heardand his prediction that immigration will be a key campaign issueappears to be coming true. Two main conservative candidates havepicked up on it, but not to Le Pen's extremes, in hopes of winningover his followers in runoff balloting May 8.   ``Today we are in great danger,'' Le Pen told his audience inthis Communist-controlled town in the northern Picardy region.France is suffering ``a demographic loss, a moral loss, a religiousloss ... and when you lose the instinct for life, you condemnyourself to death.''   Like a fire and brimstone preacher, the ruddy, silver-hairedBreton uses his considerable oratorial skills to shock, taunt,cajole his listeners. Then he homes in on his favorite fears _immigration, insecurity, drugs, AIDS _ and extols his favoritevirtues _ God, family and France.   ``The renaissance of France must come through drasticmeasures,'' said the 59-year-old fisherman's son.   If elected, Le Pen says, he will amend the constitution to allowfor referendums on social issues for France's 55 million people,then hold a vote to send large portions of non-European immigrantshome, reinstitute the death penalty for drug traffickers andterrorists, and quarantine AIDS victims.   Critics charge that Le Pen, a one-time paratrooper in Indochinaand Algeria, is a fascist, racist and anti-Semite _ which he denies_ and that his National Front encourages xenophobia.   Although running fourth in opinion polls, which give him about10 percent of the vote, Le Pen has become an important electoralfactor.   President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist, is favored forre-election, consistently garnering about 38 percent in the opinionpolls for the first round of balloting April 24. That kind ofturnout for Mitterrand, however, would mean he'd have to face arunoff May 8 against the top conservative candidate.   Thus for the divided right, Le Pen can be a spoiler.   Both of the two main conservative candidates, Premier JacquesChirac of the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic party, and formerPremier Raymond Barre, backed by the center-right Union for FrenchDemocracy, need Le Pen's voters in the runoff.   Chirac and Barre, who until recently shunned Le Pen'scontroversial themes, began addressing the issues in March onvisits to the heavily-immigrant Mediterranean port of Marseille inthe heart of the National Front's southern stronghold.   ``No one has ever reproached me for being xenophobic orracist,'' Chirac told a crowd March 10. But ``developments which wehave recently witnessed have led a certain number of our citizensto feelings of this kind. If I cannot condone it, I can understandit.''   On March 24, Barre told a crowd of about 10,000: ``The nationalinterest consists firstly of effectively stopping non-Europeanimmigration. Not for reasons of principle but because of economicand demographic circumstances. ...   ``To me, what we must do appears clear: respect human rights butat the same time defend the national interest.''   About 4.5 million foreigners live in France, of whom 1.5 millionare Moslem Arabs from the North African nations of Algeria, Tunisiaand Morocco. The remainder are people of European descent andblacks from France's former African colonies.   Immigrants have become a sensitive subject as the nationoutgrows its need for cheap foreign labor. An attempt to revise thenationality code to make it more difficult for immigrants to becomeFrench was dropped at the approach of elections.   Le Pen founded the National Front in 1972, but its politicalawakening did not come until 1984 when the party took 11 percent ofthe vote in elections for the European Parliament and seated 10deputies, the same number as the Communists. Its entree intonational politics came in the March 1986 legislative electionswhich gave the National Front 35 seats in France's NationalAssembly.   Le Pen says he will wait until May 1 to tell his supporters howto vote, or whether to vote, in the runoff.   However, he insists he still has an ``outsider's chance'' ofbeing the top conservative vote-getter April 24.   ``I don't believe in the polls,'' he said. ``People don't daresay they'll vote for us. They're afraid.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, April 4</NOTE></DOC>
