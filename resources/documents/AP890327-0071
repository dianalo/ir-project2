SHEERAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LORAIN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   This city on Lake Erie is moving closer tobecoming the third area in the country with legalized casinogambling, but residents still disagree whether a casino would be ablessing or a curse.   Lorain, an economically struggling and largely blue-collar cityof 72,000 people, would have a referendum on the issue under theproposal the state House approved March 15.   ``It would make more work and brighten this little town up,''said Herman Ricks, 50, a 27-year employee at Ford Motor Co.'sLorain Assembly Plant.   But Linda Hamilton, 32, a mother of two, said she may alreadystart to fight against the proposal.   ``I think it would hurt Lorain, and it would hurt Lorainfamilies,'' said Mrs. Hamilton. ``I think crime would definitely goup.''   The proposal, which has been pending for 14 months, faces anuncertain future in the state Senate, where hearings start nextmonth. Gov. Richard Celeste won't say yet whether he would sign orveto the legislation.   House approval sparked a surge of opposition, including commentsfrom Cleveland's top two elected officials that a casino mightattract organized crime. A organization of Roman Catholic bishopsin Ohio opposes any change in state law that could lead todevelopment of a casino.   The House bill would permit voter-approved casino gambling onlyin Lorain, as a five-year pilot project. Ohio law allows charitybingo, horse racing and the state-run lottery, but casino gamblingis legal only in the state of Nevada and in Atlantic City, N.J.   The bishops said bingo games had enough potential for abuse thatparishes were being encouraged to find other ways to raise money,and that non-charitable gambling was even more dangerous.   The originator of the proposal is Alan Spitzer, whose familyoperates more than 20 car dealerships in Ohio and Florida. Spitzerenvisions building a $400 million resort that will include a1,000-room hotel, restaurants, shops and a casino on a formerAmerican Shipbuilding Co. property his family owns on the BlackRiver, which meets Lake Erie at Lorain, 29 miles west of Cleveland.   The bill's sponsor, state Rep. Joseph Koziura, believes voterswould approve the casino proposal.   Koziura, a Democrat from Lorain, bristles when he talks aboutopposition by Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich, a Republican, andCleveland City Council President George Forbes, a Democrat.   ``It could cause us some problems,'' Koziura said. ``This is nota Republican or a Democratic bill. This bill is simply an economicdevelopment tool that we feel we ought to have the right to voteon.''   Many believe the project would be an economic boom to Lorain,which has struggled in the 1980s because of the loss of about 5,000jobs at the USX plant, the elimination of approximately 2,000 jobsat Ford and the 1983 shutdown of American Shipbuilding, which atits peak employed 1,500.   Lorain had an unemployment rate of 10.4 percent in February,while Ohio had a statewide rate of 6.9 percent, said Mayor AlexOlejko, one of the proposal's strongest backers.   Supporters believe the casino-hotel complex would employ up to4,000 people, with increases in tourist-related employmentproviding a net gain of 10,000 jobs.   Others are concerned that a casino would increase crime andcorruption.   Police Chief John Malinovsky was indicted this month on felonycharges of extortion and perjury for allegedly pressuring fireinspectors into ignoring fire code violations at a charity bingohall his daughter planned to run.   One of his subordinates, Sgt. Wayne Long, is serving a two-yearprison term in connection with the same investigation.   Safety Director Richard Yepko resigned last week after policeannounced that he was being investigated for allegedly tellinglocal clubs shortly after Malinovsky's arrest that illegal gamblingwould be overlooked. Yepko hasn't been charged.   ``I think all this negative publicity will hurt the chances ofthe casino,'' said Robert Azzariti Jr., a high school businessteacher who says he hasn't decided how he would vote.   ``Lorain needs something, and we need to develop thewaterfront,'' Azzariti said. ``But you'd have to worry about thecrime element. You'd have to worry about the kinds of people acasino draws in. I worry about these things, too _ about what'sgoing to happen to the moral fiber of the community.''   Olejko said the legislation includes protections againstorganized crime. The Ohio attorney general automatically would be amember of a commission overseeing the casino's operation, andvoters would have an opportunity to decide whether to retain thecasino after five years.</TEXT></DOC>
