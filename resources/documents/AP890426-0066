He said 37 people were wounded, 10 seriously, in the fighting,which began about 1 p.m. They were taken to the hospital at theKhao-I-Dang refugee camp run by the International Committee of theRed Cross.   The aid official said the dead included Thais but that most wereCambodians. He had no other details.   Ta Phraya district is in the province of Prachinburi in easternThailand and about 50 miles north of the Thai town of Aranyaprathet.   Black market trading and clashes over it are rife along theThai-Cambodian border. The trading involves Thais as well asCambodian guerrillas and refugees in guerrilla-run camps along thefrontier.   Also today, gunners continued attacks on Cambodian refugee campsin Thailand, hitting the Site 2 camp with heavy shells thatseriously injured four refugees, the Western official said. Theinjured were taken to the Khao-I-Dang hospital, he said.   Site 2, with about 180,000 people, is the largest U.N.-aidedCambodian refugee camp in Thailand. Its outer perimeter is only ahalf-mile from the Cambodian border.   Site 2 is controlled by guerrillas of the Khmer People'sNational Liberation Front. The front is one of three guerrillagroups fighting Vietnamese forces and troops of the Cambodiangovernment Vietnam installed after invading 10 years ago.   It was not clear who fired the shells, which forced evacuationof all but the most essential Western aid workers. The refugeeswere not evacuated.   In the past, shellings along the border escalated as the twosides maneuvered in advance of diplomatic events. Cambodianresistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk is to hold talks inIndonesia next week with Hun Sen, premier of the pro-Vietnamesegovernment.   Aid officials said some shells passed over Site 2 on Saturday,and two rounds landed in the camp Sunday, sending one man to thecamp hospital.
