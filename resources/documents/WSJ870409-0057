The Senate cleared by unanimous consent a compromise proposal that would allow construction of new units that burn only gas if they can be refitted to use coal or another fuel.    The language specifically authorizes construction of plants that use gas to power turbines and to heat boilers with the turbine's exhaust. Utilities are investing in such combined-cycle plants to meet peaks in demand because of their efficiency and low capital costs. They can consume coal indirectly if they are connected to plants that make low-energy gas from coal.    The House Energy and Power subcommittee approved similar legislation Tuesday.    The Senate bill includes language that would repeal a law designed to make industrial users, rather than consumers, bear the brunt of gas price increases. The &quot;incremental pricing&quot; rule has proved complex and difficult to administer, industry officials said. But Democrats have stripped that from the House bill, and they are expected to keep it off to prevent a fight over whether to decontrol all natural gas prices. </TEXT></DOC>
