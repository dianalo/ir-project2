In addition,CCC is not required by 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other provision of law to publisha notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the subject matter of thisrule. Therefore, the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable to thisrule.The titles and numbers of the Federal Domestic Assistance Programs to whichthis proposed rule applies are: Commodity Loans and Purchases, 10.051;Cotton Production Stabilization, 10.052; Feed Grain Production Stabilization,10.055; Storage Facilities and Equipment loans, 10.056; Wheat ProductionStabilization, 10.058; Rice Production Stabilization, 10.065; Grain ReserveProgram, 10.067; as listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.The Attorney General and Comptroller General have jointly promulgated theFederal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS) in 4 CFR Parts 101 through 105as mandated by the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31U.S.C. 3711-3719). CCC is generally exempt from the provisions of the FCCS,since CCC has the authority under section 4(k) of the CCC Charter Act (15U.S.C. 714b(k)) to make final and conclusive settlement and adjustmentof all its claims. However, the Board of Directors, CCC, has administrativelydetermined that the FCCS shall be applicable to all claims by CCC regardlessof the amount (CCC Claims Policy Docket CZ161a, Revision 4).The FCCS requires that interest be charged on delinquent debts. In accordancewith the FCCS, CCC issued regulations at 7 CFR Part 1403, concerning interestto be assessed on delinquent debts owed to CCC.CCC proposes to amend this regulation to revise the definition of the term``full amount of the delinquent debt'' to make it clear that the term doesnot include administrative costs incurred as a result of the delinquentdebt; that is, the additional costs incurred in processing and handlingthe debt because it became delinquent as defined in 7 CFR 1403.2(d). TheFCCS expressly states that late payment interest should not be assessedon these costs.CCC also proposes to amend the regulation to clarify the dates from whichlate payment interest accrues and is assessed because the current regulationis vague concerning this difference. This revision will make it clear thatit is CCC's policy to follow the rule set forth in the FCCS at 4 CFR 102.13concerning interest, penalties, and administrative costs.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1403</ITAG>Claims, Income taxes, Loan program_agriculture.Accordingly, it is proposed that the regulations at 7 CFR Part 1403 beamended to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1403_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
