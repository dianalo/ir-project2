SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The big wet currently being administered to theEast is in the tradition of some serious drenchings of the past,events when tropical storms got things started and then let naturetake its soggy course.   ``It's not a frequent occurrence, but it happens,'' said stormspecialist Bob Case of the National Hurricane Center in CoralGables, Fla., noting that a similar situation created devastatingfloods in West Virginia four years ago.   ``This was not anything like a once-in-a-lifetime event, but itwasn't a garden variety storm either,'' added Scott Kroczynski ofthe National Weather Service's Office of Hydrology in Silver Spring,Md.   The flooding in the last day or two wasn't spread over a largearea, but was severe in some localities, explained Kroczynski andco-worker Frank Richards.   Intense rain drenched a relatively narrow strip from suburbanWashington to suburban New York on Wednesday, they noted, with 2 to6 inches of rain in most areas but 10 inches or more in some spots,especially in northern Delaware, where at least two people drowned.   Many people are blaming tropical storm Allison for the intenserain, which disrupted train service between New York and Washington,swept away a camper in North Carolina and generally createdmiserable conditions along the East Coast.   Allison's remains, however, are in Alabama. That storm, despitethe intense rain it brought ashore in Texas and Louisiana more thana week ago, isn't a direct part of the East Coast problems, Casesaid.   But it is taking some of the blame, he noted. And that'sappropriate, since it helped create the mess.   ``The last similar situation was .... Hurricane Juan in 1985,when severe flooding occurred in Virginia and West Virginia.'' Casesaid.   ``Juan did the same thing. It did not cause the flooding, but(it) opened the the way,'' he said. Before Juan, tropical stormAgnes in 1972 brought similar devastating rains, he explained.   Allison came ashore in Texas, worked northward to reach westernKentucky by last Monday, then drifted back to Alabama, where it isnow a low pressure area. At the same time, a high pressure center islocated off the East Coast.   Air around a low moves in a counter-clockwise direction. Aroundhighs, it circulates clockwise.   When they meet, those circulations are like two meshed gearsturning away, explained Case, with a low to the west turningcounterclockwise and a high to the east turning clockwise.   That means the air flows combine between the two centers, pullingwarm, moist air northward from the Gulf of Mexico to ``inundate theUnited States east of the Appalachians,'' Case explained.   ``The real culprit is this inundation of tropical, unstableair,'' he added.   As it moves north, the warm, wet air rises, pushed up by the landand generally lifted over cooler air already in the area. Rising aircools; cooler air can hold less moisture than warm air, and _ bingo_ the result is rain.   Richards and Kroczynski explained that on Tuesday night andWednesday some cold air moved in above the warm tropical air in thestretch between Washington and New York.   This cold air, which was heavier and more dense, then sank down.   That led to a sudden overturning of the cold and warm air. ``Onceit started, it was almost like a chain reaction,'' said Richards,explaining the localized deluges.</TEXT></DOC>
