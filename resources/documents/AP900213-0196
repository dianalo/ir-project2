Moscow and Washington, East and West, stood toe-to-toe along theIron Curtain. It took a million soldiers, 12,000 strategic nuclearwarheads and a growing defense budget to keep the peace in Europe.   Inside a year, the world changed.   ``For eons we've been saying, `The Russians are coming, theRussians are coming,''' says Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif. ``Wellthey haven't come, and they aren't coming.'' Defense SecretaryRichard Cheney told Congress: ``We are now on the verge of winningone of the greatest victories in the history of the world without ashot ever being fired.''   Three arms treaties are being negotiated for the signatures ofPresidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Once they are settled _reducing the stockpiles of chemical weapons, conventional forces inEurope and long-range nuclear missiles _ the American military willbe transformed in size and purpose.   Yet with the outbreak of peace, as Gov. Richard Celeste of Ohionotes, ``there can be a dark side.''   Peace is not a completely comforting prospect for everyone:   _Not for the 1,600 people who work in St. Louis at the ArmyTroop Support Command, distributor of uniforms, tents and othermilitary supplies. The Pentagon wants to close it.   _Not for the 101,000 who work for General Dynamics Corp., makerof tanks, submarines, jets and missiles in plants from Florida toCalifornia.   The No. 2 defense contractor has become a symbol of theend-of-the-Cold War malady. Public relations executive ChrisSchildz discourages reporters seeking interviews on how the companyis going to handle it.   _Not for thousands upon thousands of GIs who now must confrontsomething that American soldiers don't usually worry about _ jobsecurity.   Today's troops aren't draftees like those let go after World WarII or the Korean War or Vietnam. They are volunteers. Many chosethe service as a career. Demobilization, for them, is as rude aslap as a layoff for a factory worker.   ``We are very well aware of the fact that this is the first timethe United States of America has ever taken apart an army made upof all volunteers,'' says Lt. Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan, the Army'sdeputy chief of staff for operations and plans. He says it's tooearly to estimate how many soldiers will be let go.   _Not for the 13,000 people in and around Lima, Ohio, who owetheir jobs to the Army Tank Plant. It makes the M-1 Abrams tank, a60-ton monster deemed too muscular for the lighter, more mobileArmy the Pentagon envisions for the 1990s. The plant is scheduledto close in 1993.   Don Downhour, a Lima resident who doesn't work at the plant,says he's sympathetic to the plight of the tank builders, but hesees another side. ``We don't need tanks if we're going to havepeace,'' he muses. ``And that's what we've been praying for.''   Harry O'Brien, shop steward at the Saco Defense plant in Saco,Maine, whose mainstay is the Mk-19 grenade launcher, says hisco-workers are worried by the defense cutbacks. ``Everybody issaying, `Gee, what happens if we get closed down?','' he says   The diminishing of the 45-year-old threat of global war betweenthe two superpowers is worrisome in other places, too:   _In President Bush's White House. No sooner had Bush submittedhis budget to Congress, calling for a slight drop in Pentagonspending next year, than he took to the road to sell Americans on asingle idea: Cutting back too fast, too far is dangerous folly.   _At the Pentagon, where Cheney has been carrying the Bushmessage to Capitol Hill. He is a man in the middle _ knowingreductions will be forced by Congress, but needing to protectBush's cautious approach and the strategic concerns of the armedforces.   _In Congress, where claimants for the ``peace dividend'' _ thosewho want to retire some national debt; or cut Social Securitytaxes; or address the problems of the homeless and ill-housed,hungry and poor; or repair decaying bridges, roads and sewagesystems; or fix America's education system; or ease themedical-cost burden of the elderly _ are lining up for a piece ofthe pie. A pie that Bush says doesn't exist.   _And again in Congress, where some foresee severe economicupheavals if defense plants and bases close suddenly and thousandsof workers are left in the cold.   The trouble, then, is figuring out just how much defense todrop, and where.   If the Cold War is over, what is the justification for spending25 cents of every federal dollar on defense _ half of which goes todeterring a Soviet invasion of Europe now deemed less likely than ablue moon?   From the fall of the Berlin Wall in November to the SovietCommunist Party's historic decision Feb. 7 to give up its powermonopoly, events in the East bloc have eroded the veryunderpinnings of Western strategic thinking. Indeed, the EastEuropean states no longer are a ``bloc'' in the traditional sense.   In this new world order, what will the United States do with itsmilitary might? Fight terrorists? Play ``policeman'' in Third Worldhot spots? Revert to the isolationism so dreaded by U.S. allies inEurope and Asia?   One answer may be in joining the Bush administration's war ondrugs, and the president is pressing for more money to use Marinesand other military resources to help keep drugs out of the country.For years the Pentagon fought the idea, arguing it would sapreadiness to fight conventional wars and involve soldiers in policework, customarily a civilian concern. Those misgivings seem to havediminished.   The exact features of the military transformation are not yetclear, but some signs are visible. U.S. troop strength is beingcut, bases closed, weapon programs illed and security threatsreassessed.   Less clear is what these changes will mean for individualsoldiers and their families, for communities and companies thatdepend on a thriving military-industrial complex, and for a NATOalliance facing possible disintegration.   Bush says he hopes attrition will reduce the ranks of themilitary so that relatively few soldiers will have to be discharged.   ``I would like to think that a kid that went in to make a careerout of this would not be unceremoniously dumped from the armedservices,'' he told reporters recently.   As Pentagon planners redefine the military's mission,politicians are rushing to reset the nation's spending priorities.They see a new hope for social programs that took second place tothe 1980s military buildup.   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., has proposed carving out a $169billion ``peace dividend'' over the next five years _ more thanquadruple the savings proposed by Bush in the same period. Rep.Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., accuses Bush of ``beating plowshares intoswords.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
