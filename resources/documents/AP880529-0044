But Krunic rejected a multi-party system and other radicalreforms in a speech to about 800 Communist Party delegates meetingto find ways of dealing with Yugoslavia's social and financialproblems.   ``We are, I should say, in the epicenter of the crisis witheconomic stagnation on the brink of a recession, a high inflationthat threatens to run away, and ever sharper social problems andpolitical dissatisfaction,'' said Krunic.   Yugoslavia is saddled with a 170 percent inflation, a $21billion foreign debt and a 15 percent unemployment rate.   The three-day conference comes halfway between two partycongresses and follows rumors of an attempted military coup tosuppress dissent in Slovenia, Yugoslavia's most advanced republic.Slovenia this month filed an unsuccessful motion in the federalParliament requesting the removal of Premier Branko Mikulic.   ``A society which enters such a crisis ... cannot emerge from itwithout profound changes,'' said the party chief. ``Socialupheavals are certain to take place and may be grave.''   The government launched an emergency economic program onSaturday, including an almost 24 percent devaluation of theever-weaker national currency, the dinar, hefty price hikes andwage cuts of up to 30 percent.   Krunic said these measures ``are not easy at all, but arecausing and will cause many shocks, clashes of interest, greatsocial problems.''   The austerity package was expected to further erode saggingliving standards, which have already dipped by one-third since1980, and set off a new wave of social unrest. Sporadic workerstrikes have flared in various parts of the country to protest ofthe belt-tightening moves, which were announced several weeks ago.   ``The stability of the political system has been shaken,''Krunic told the delegates.   Conference documents pledge a separation of party and stateadministration, curbs on red tape and more openness.   In a draft document circulated before the meeting, the partymembership is called ``to end the party's impotence and inertia andoppose bureaucratic and static rule which is believed to be themain cause of numerous deformations and failures.''   The document demands that the party ``abandon its leadershiprole and (instead) act as a leading force in society, whose majorgoals are freedom, democracy and the material well-being of thepeople.''   But Krunic rejected changes toward a multi-party system andother radical reforms as a way of regaining control of the economy.   He made clear that the Communist Party intends to continue itsone-party rule and a system of self-management that provides forlimited worker power-sharing in managing companies.   The party chief asserted it was the historic mission of YugoslavCommunists ``not to permit the blind forces to gain the upper handor changes which, regardless of intentions, would objectively meanabandoning self-management.''   Krunic claimed that recent calls for a new constitution and areshaping of the political system according to Western models ``arein fact counterrevolutionary.''   He said the current system ``must keep the gates tightly shut''to solutions leading to a dogmatic, Soviet-type system, on the onehand, or to a Western-type, multi-party democracy, on the other.   Krunic also revealed the party was exposed to pressures from``the bourgeois right wing, which pulls toward restoration of thecapitalistic relationship and bourgeois democracy''   He said such changes of the political system ``would lead us tonational conflicts, which are known from the past.''   Neverthless, Krunic said one of Yugoslavia's most importanttasks was the establishment of a free market for capital andworkers, which is a highly controversial topic among YugoslavCommunists. For some party officials, he said _ referring to thedogmatic party wing opposed to a free-market economy _ such aninnovation is tantamount to ``anarchy'' and the abandonment ofsocialism.   Krunic said the view, espoused by many party hard-liners, thatuse of foreign capital for increasing industrial production was athreat to socialist ownership, was unacceptable.   Compounding Yugoslavia's economic problems are unresolved ethnictensions in this mostly-Balkan nation, whose republics range fromthe southern Serbian province of Kosovo _ with its 85 percentAlbanian population _ to northern Slovenia, which borders onAustria and Italy.   In an open letter published Thursday, 22 Slovenian officials,including government members, journalists and other intellectuals,demanded a thorough explanation of this spring's rumored militarycoup, which they called the ``crudest violation of assured rightsof citizens and of the current constitution'' of Yugoslavia.   The government said the coup rumors were false.</TEXT></DOC>
