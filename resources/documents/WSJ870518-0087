Insurers are avoiding or reducing claims by isolating high-risk applicants with AIDS antibody tests, fighting off attempts by some states to ban such blood tests, and using substitutes for the tests when they are banned. Insurers are also denying new policies on social grounds and aggressively fighting existing policyholders' claims in court.    To the extent that the industry's tactics are successful, AIDS victims and taxpayers, particularly taxpayers, will have to bear more of the costs. The insurance industry's tactics have been denounced by homosexual advocates and thwarted by regulatory agencies. But there is hope of easing the conflict through the use of so-called risk pools, to spread liability for huge claims among companies and those who pay premiums.    About half of all insurance companies today are trying to use AIDS antibody tests for individual health and life policies. Mutual of Omaha Insurance Cos. requires antibody testing in applicants for life-insurance policies of $250,000 or more. At Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., the threshold is $200,000. Some major companies -- including Aetna Life andamp; Casualty and Prudential Insurance Co. -- refuse to disclose how large a policy triggers the test. &quot;We prefer not to put it out there as a target,&quot; says Prudential spokesman Richard Matthews.    Most states still permit insurance carriers to use the AIDS antibody tests to assess the health status of applicants. But their use has been prohibited in California and the District of Columbia; New York and Massachusetts are hostile to the tests, and half a dozen other states may refuse to allow them for insurance screening, according to a trade association spokesman.    The test doesn't indicate that one has acquired immune deficiency syndrome, only that one is infected with the virus. Usually companies use three tests employing two different technologies -- two ELISAs, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and one Western Blot. Challenges to their use in predicting illness are fading somewhat since many scientists have come to believe that a majority of infected individuals will eventually get sick. The remaining strong challenge has do to with civil rights.    To insurers, confirmation of a positive test usually means that they will deny coverage. In a survey by the American Council of Life Insurers and the Health Insurance Association of America, 91% of companies said they consider an AIDS-infected applicant &quot;uninsurable&quot; at any price.    The industry argues that rejecting such applicants is as legitimate as weighing cigarette-smoking, or a history of heart disease or cancer, in underwriting policies. &quot;We want to preserve the right to use all pertinent forms of medical information,&quot; says a spokeswoman for the health and life insurers. Still, critics reply that while cigarette smoking, cancer and heart disease may in some cases merely raise rates or restrict coverage, AIDS infection closes the door utterly.    Pro-test forces are fighting hard. Wisconsin, which originally banned use of the antibody tests, later reversed itself. Companies such as Aetna and Prudential stopped writing new policies in the District of Columbia to protest the test ban. Paul Revere Life Insurance Co. is lobbying the Massachusetts insurance commissioner, promising privacy, confidentiality and nondiscrimination in test use, if he will relent in his opposition. John Budd, the company's senior vice president and general counsel, says that unless the test is allowed, &quot;the epidemic could cause solvency problems.&quot;    Companies in California, though forbidden to use antibody tests as an insurance tool, have found other ways to assess AIDS risk. Blue Shield of California, for example, is one company that asks applicants if they have a history of sexually transmitted diseases.    &quot;If a person admits to having had hepatitis, gonorrhea, herpes and a touch of syphilis, he's a bad risk right off the bat . . . though not directly due to AIDS,&quot; says Ralph Schaffarzick, Blue Shield's vice president of medical operations. Another widely used surrogate is the T-cell test, which generally measures numbers of infection-fighting white blood cells. Homosexual rights groups don't oppose such tests so long as they are administered evenhandedly to all applicants for insurance, not just to presumed homosexuals, single men, members of certain professions and residents of certain neighborhoods.    In some cases, critics charge, companies may not even bother trying to be circuitous. Last week, National Gay Rights Advocates accused Aetna of asking a San Jose, Calif., man to take the AIDS antibody test in violation of state law. The group filed an angry protest with the state insurance department. In Hartford, Conn., an Aetna spokesman says he is unfamiliar with details of the alleged incident, but, he adds, &quot;We don't think we've done anything wrong.&quot;    Finally, companies are aggressively litigating claims. Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New York often goes to court to resist claims submitted by current policyholders, arguing, for example, that a case of Kaposi's Sarcoma or pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, both AIDS diseases, indicates an uninsured &quot;pre-existing condition&quot; of AIDS virus infection. Many policies are written to exclude symptoms of illness existing before policies were issued. However, this &quot;contestable period&quot; usually lasts only two years -- after which policies are valid for any insured condition. After two years, life insurance policies are generally unchallengeable, too, even if the policyholder misrepresented himself in his application.    Lawsuits involving denied claims usually are &quot;settled for small dollars,&quot; says Jerrold Ehrlich, Empire's associate general counsel. Though the industry's average AIDS-related medical claim is about $36,000, Mr. Ehrlich says settlement negotiations usually involve a three-way splitting of costs between patient, hospital and insurer -- with Empire paying only 10% to 25% of the disputed claim.    Benjamin Schatz, an attorney and founder of National Gay Rights Advocates, says the legal tactics are a cynical waiting game. &quot;Companies are betting that people will die before they have a chance to litigate,&quot; he says. &quot;The life span of an AIDS patient is shorter than the life span of a lawsuit.&quot; Of course, estates can sue, too.    The insurance industry, in talking of billions of dollars in claims and possible insolvency, has &quot;greatly exaggerated&quot; its financial burden, Mr. Schatz says. Claims for AIDS so far aren't out of line with other terminal illnesses that haven't yet bankrupted the nation's 2,000 carriers. Insurers reply that without the ability to screen out high-risk applicants, their costs will explode as the epidemic grows.    Mr. Schatz also argues that antibody tests risk a breach of confidentiality that can cost an applicant his job and home. And though it is predictive of illness, he notes some states prevent carriers from using other medically valid but controversial and socially sensitive tests -- such as a test for sickle-cell anemia or Tay-Sachs disease, genetic diseases principally affecting blacks and Jews respectively.    &quot;So there is a precedent,&quot; he argues, for balancing actuarial risk against discrimination.    Apart from the difficulty of obtaining new policies, Mr. Schatz says he has received hundreds of calls from bona fide policyholders who charge that they are unable to get their AIDS claims paid. Many companies will fish for vague prior signs of any illness and then cite it as a &quot;pre-existing condition&quot; of AIDS, he alleges.    &quot;When a policyholder develops AIDS, companies are scanning records for episodes of flu or diarrhea, citing it as a pre-existing condition,&quot; Mr. Schatz contends.    Brent Nance, an independent Los Angeles insurance agent who is himself a homosexual, says a recent survey disclosed that a majority of the 26 largest health and life carriers still use questionable or even illegal underwriting tools -- such as redlining neighborhoods with large homosexual populations, rejecting single men and men designating male friends as beneficiaries.    Insurers, for their part, counter that some homosexuals, knowing themselves to be infected with the AIDS virus, have gone shopping for policies. &quot;It's like buying home insurance on a burning house,&quot; a trade group official says.    Whatever the insurance industry's ultimate financial burden might turn out to be, both sides agree that risk pools are a partial solution. Risk pools are funds to which companies contribute for the coverage of &quot;uninsurables,&quot; or for payment of million-dollar claims by existing policyholders.    Mr. Nance says both types are necessary to spread risk fairly. But so far only about a dozen states have adopted risk pools, and none of the most populous states has done so.
