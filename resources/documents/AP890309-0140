VERNACI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Television evangelist Pat Robertson, who oncesaid he would not accept government money for his Republicanpresidential campaign, has received more than $10.1 million, settinga new record, the Federal Election Commission said.   The commission gave Robertson $243,296 this week, boosting himover the $10.1 million record set in 1984 by then-President Reagan'sre-election campaign, said Scott Moxley, a spokesman for thecommission.   Reagan's 1984 allotment later was reduced to about $9.75 million,Moxley said.   Candidates who meet certain fund-raising and vote-gatheringthresholds are eligible to get matching money from the federalTreasury to help pay for their campaigns in the presidentialprimaries.   The major parties' presidential nominees then have their entirecampaigns paid for by the taxpayers, with the candidates receivingequal funding. Last year Republican George Bush and Democrat MichaelDukakis received $46.1 million each for their general electioncampaigns. That money is separate from the money provided during theprimaries.   Dukakis received $9 million in matching funds for his campaign inthe primaries and Bush received nearly $8.4 million.   Among the other 1988 candidates, Democrat Jesse Jackson gotalmost $8 million, Republican Bob Dole received $7.6 million, andRepublican Jack Kemp received almost $6 million.   In all, the federal government paid nearly $66.7 million inmatching funds to 15 candidates in last year's primary campaigns.   Early in the campaign Robertson had said that he wasphilosophically opposed to government funding for presidentialcampaigns and that he would not accept it.   However, after a string of losses, Robertson's campaign got intoa financial pinch, and he took the government money.   In year-end papers filed with the Federal Election Commission,Robertson's campaign reported that it was nearly half a milliondollars in debt.   In another presidential funding matter, the commission onThursday ordered the campaign of former Delaware Gov. Pierre S. duPont IV, a Republican, to repay $23,254 to the Treasury. Thecommission ruled that costs of a central telephone bank caused thedu Pont campaign to exceed the spending limits set for the campaignsduring the Iowa caucuses.</TEXT></DOC>
