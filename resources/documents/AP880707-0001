It was just like a bombhit that corner store there.''   The roof and front wall of La Tienda Amigo, known as the AmigoStore, caved in at about 2:20 p.m. CDT. Emergency crews usingportable lights continued into the night digging through mounds ofbroken cinderblocks, glass, twisted steel and merchandise to pullout survivors and look for victims.   ``They thought they heard some voices and that's where they'redigging now,'' city spokeswoman Pam Downing said about 10 p.m.   Rescuers cut through a wall inside a Woolworth's store next doorto reach some of those trapped. Witnesses said they heard screamsfrom the wreckage. Linens and clothing blown from the store by highwinds were being used to wrap the wounds of the injured.   Police Sgt. Dean Poos said shortly after 7 p.m. that ``we don'treally think there are going to be any more live people coming outof there.''   Ambulances and rescue personnel were hampered in reaching thescene by floodwaters from the downpour. Steve Fitzgibbons, actingassistant city manager, said some local businesses had volunteeredfront-end loaders and cranes to help.   The National Weather Service said the collapse could have beencaused by the weight of the rainwater, which dumped more than 2inches in less than 30 minutes.   The store was half a block from the international bridge, andsheriff's Lt. Johnny Castillo said that when the storm began, alarge number of Mexican nationals ``were running there to get outof the rain. The store was packed.''   Poos said store owner Bernard Levine told him that when the roofcollapsed, ``he jumped under a table, and all he knows is that wheneverything settled, he looked up and there was blue sky above him.''   Levine said he escaped with three employees and three customers.   Poos said six bodies had been removed from the rubble andidentified, and Johnny Economedes, head of one rescue team, saidworkers had found two more bodies.   ``They've got two steel beams across them and about 20 or 30tons of concrete'' on them, Economedes said.   Poos said eight people were admitted to hospitals and another 34were treated at three hospitals in Brownsville and nearby SanBenito.   Authorities said they could only guess at the number of peoplewho might have been trapped inside. Poos estimated it would be nomore than 50 and Castillo speculated it could be as many as 125.   Poos said the dead included a woman who was apparently crushedas she sat in a car with Mexican license plates in front of thebuilding. Two others were killed as they stood under a canopy infront of the store.   ``All of a sudden, I hear a noise kind of like a boom and I waslooking directly at the store and I see this tan-colored,sandy-colored wall that filled the whole front of the store,'' saidAnthony Padilla, a Brownsville Herald photographer who was shootingweather photos in front of the store when the roof collapsed.   ``It was coming forward, then the windows, the entirestorefront, the windows just exploded out,'' he said. ``Glass justwent out. People just went like this, covered their heads, kind ofducked down, and in the next instant, the whole thing just camedown.   ``The people I had been looking at were just covered withrubble,'' he said, adding one woman's hand was pinned to a parkingmeter after a steel I-beam collapsed and left her surrounded withcinder blocks.   U.S. Border Patrol officials and other law enforcement agencies,including Mexican authorities, assisted in the rescue operation.   An emergency treatment center was set up at a civic center abouttwo blocks away and authorities blocked off the area.   A meteorologist with the National Weather Service in San Antoniowho asked not to be identified said that in the kind of storm thathit the area, ``the drops are very large and very heavy, and thefact that the storm system wasn't moving very fast _ only about 10miles an hour _ can cause heavy flooding.''</TEXT></DOC>
