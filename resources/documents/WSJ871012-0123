But those who elevated sanctions into a major foreign-policy issue last year are now relatively silent. The reason is the clear evidence that sanctions have had little effect other than to throw thousands of blacks out of work.    By playing the sanction card, the U.S. also squandered much of its limited ability to affect conditions in South Africa. But the real tragedy of sanctions is that they undercut one of the most effective weapons nonwhites in South Africa have against apartheid: their growing economic power.    As Alan Keyes, until recently an assistant U.S. secretary of state, points out, blacks have achieved their greatest victories over apartheid in the economy. Since black trade unions were legalized in 1979, membership has risen from 120,000 to one million. The recent mining strike and the pass-law repeal demonstrate the growing economic leverage blacks have.    South Africa's blacks have also found ingenious ways to undercut dozens of apartheid-based laws limiting their participation in the economy. At least three million blacks (out of 25 million) are estimated to work in the underground economy.    Until 1984, it was illegal for blacks to own or operate transit systems. Now there are some 40,000 black-owned cabs in South Africa, and a black group is seeking majority ownership of Putco, the largest private transit company in the Southern Hemisphere. NAFCOC, the black chamber of commerce, had 10,000 members in 1984 and 15,000 today. The erosion of economic apartheid through civil disobedience and lax enforcement has created over 100,000 small black businesses in the past decade.    Sanctions threaten to halt this progress in its tracks. Blacks, especially rural blacks, are losing their jobs instead of building new ones. South Africa's fruit industry, its overseas markets endangered, has laid off some 40,000 of its 220,000 nonwhite workers. COSATU, the militant black trade-union group, warned in a recent report that further disinvestment and sanctions could cost two million blacks their jobs by the year 2000.    The Reagan administration is finally recognizing the need to promote this kind of black power base. Secretary of State George Shultz recently praised the accomplishments of black schools, unions and entrepreneurs in undermining apartheid and convincing whites that blacks can prosper if given the necessary freedom.    The U.S. should go further, however, and redirect foreign aid and tax incentives for U.S. subsidiaries to help blacks -- as consumers, workers and even investors -- push for nonviolent change. But blacks can exert this power only if the South African economy grows. The continued flight of U.S. firms from the country benefits only the current holders of capital.    The U.S. may be unwilling or unable to take the kind of leadership role this strategy requires. If so, those who reject apocalyptic moralism as a means of fighting apartheid should look toward Great Britain, which has 12% of its overseas investment in South Africa and whose companies largely have decided to stay.    This week the Commonwealth Conference will open in Vancouver, Canada. Calls for further sanctions will be made, many by African countries that refuse to impose sanctions of their own. Margaret Thatcher has a unique opportunity not only to reject such a destructive policy but also to call on the West to help blacks build on the economic strength they are using to undermine apartheid. </TEXT></DOC>
