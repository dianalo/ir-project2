<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-21-1303 </DOCNO><TEXT>High-resolution electron microscopy shows the coexistence of several distinctcore structures for coincident-site lattice boundaries in NiO bicrystalsnear {Sigma} = 5, (310), and {Sigma} = 13, (510). Lattice expansion perpendicularto the {Sigma} = 5 grain boundaries is considerably smaller than calculatedtheoretically. Structural units in boundaries near {Sigma} = 13, (510)exhibit translations normal to the grain boundary plane, resulting ina rumpling of the interface on an atomic scale. Our observations suggestthe presence of a high concentration of Schottky pairs in the grain boundaries.</TEXT></DOC>
