(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   From Kurt and Dena Chase's back porch,fields of corn stretch away toward the horizon, a healthy-lookinggreen. But the stalks have no ears. The rains came too late inBarry County.   Day by day, as they endure the worst drought of their lifetime,the young farm couple try not to dwell on their worries, especiallyin front of their two small children.   But 4-year-old Jesse knows something is wrong.   ``There's not a prayer Jesse says that he doesn't ask forrain,'' Dena says sadly, but with a mother's proud smile. ``Hesays, `If there's anything up there, Jesus, let it pour!' ''   And some rain has come.   When a pair of storms roared through in mid-July and dumped 2inches of rain _ more than farmers here had seen in several months_ the cornstalks shot up a foot in four days.   The rain boosted morale. But the Chases know it did not arrivesoon enough for most of the 350 acres of corn they farm with Kurt'sparents, Gordon and Jean Chase. Had the skies opened up two weeksearlier, it might have done some good.   The two generations of Chases, who live less than a mile apartoff a gravel road, will see underdeveloped ears on most plants andnone at all on others. Some stalks never made it out of the ground.   The soybeans and hay now have a chance at survival _ but only ifthe rain continues. The helplessness the family feels has taken itstoll.   ``I've never really thought about doing anything else butfarming,'' says Kurt, 28, as he relaxes on the living-room couch,Jesse and 2{-year-old Abby wrestling at his feet.   ``But a year like this one kind of makes you wonder.''   Kurt has been helping his father on the farm ever since he canremember. Now he is a partner.   His 30-year-old sister, Kim, lives with her husband and twoyoung children, and his 26-year-old brother, Kyle, works for aninsurance company. They both live within an hour's drive of thefarm and come over often to help out.   ``For me, it just felt right to stay in farming,'' Kurt says.   But he has felt the temptation to trade in 90-hour weeks ofendless chores for a 40-hour week at a factory and more time withhis family. It's a temptation he resists.   Some days he doesn't get to see his daughter at all. She'ssleeping when he leaves at 4:30 a.m. to milk the cows, and she'sbeen tucked in for the night by the time he gets home at 9:30 p.m.Sometimes, Kurt must ``baby-sit'' the irrigation system through thenight to make sure nothing goes wrong and no water is wasted.   ``I probably spend more time with my father than with Dena,''says Kurt, who has his father's thick blond hair, fair skin andfootball player's physique.   He and Dena, a pretty brunette, met in high school and weremarried eight years ago. They are expecting their third child inJanuary.   Their 115-year-old, five-bedroom farmhouse needs paint, and therickety stairs out back need fixing. But inside, bunches of driedflowers hang from the ceiling, and art and ornaments grace thewalls. The same attention to detail can be seen in Gordon andJean's home, right down to the flagpole and Old Glory outside.   Kurt and Dena find time together when they can.   Dena, 27, sometimes packs lunches and takes the children out towhere Kurt is working in the fields, and they share a picnic.During spring planting, the children spent long hours with theirparents in the cab of a tractor.   Neither Kurt nor his father can find the words to explain fullythe sense of pride they feel in owning and cultivating land. Butthe pride seems to more than make up for the stress that, even ingood times, accompanies it.   Kurt beams as he watches Jesse play with a miniature John Deeretractor in his sandbox.   ``He does everything his dad does,'' Dena says.   The farming operation is based at Jean and Gordon's home. Ascows graze outside, a computer terminal inside shows the changingprices corn, soybeans and other commodities on the Chicago Board ofTrade.   ``There's a lot of stress involved when your business is basedat home,'' Jean says. ``It seems salesmen always pull in whenyou're halfway through your meal. ... That's probably why vacationsare so important to us.''   It's also probably why Gordon and Jean plan to build a homenearby, ``but not on this road,'' when they're ready to retire.That's when Kurt and Dena will move into their house.   Gordon and Jean believe their son and daughter-in-law will builda better, but not necessarily bigger farm when they take over.   ``We see something different in their generation _ they havedifferent priorities,'' Jean says. ``Maybe seeing our parents comethrough the Depression, we thought bigger was better. But theydon't _ maybe after witnessing all the hard times we've had.''   This year will surely stick in their memories.   The drought's final impact will not be known until the harvestis finished in late fall. Much still depends on whether the raincontinues.   ``All we can do,'' says Jean, ``is wait and hope.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for PMs Tues Aug. 2 or Thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
