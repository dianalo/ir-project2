The address of the laboratory covered by this recognition is: MET ElectricalTesting Company, Inc., Laboratory Division, 916 West Patapsco Avenue, Baltimore,Maryland 21230. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>MET Electrical Testing Company, Inc., was incorporated in Baltimore, Marylandin October, 1959, as Eastern Electrical Testing Laboratories, accordingto the applicant. The name was changed one year later to Maryland ElectricalTesting Company to eliminate confusion between the acronym ``EETL'' andsimilar acronyms of other laboratories. In 1973, the Company's expansioninto Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania necessitated an additional name change tothe present one of MET Electrical Testing Company, which removed the restrictive``Maryland'' from the Company's name. However, according to the applicant,MET has been corporately the same organization since its inception in 1959.Since that time, MET has expanded further by purchasing the BurlingtonTesting Company of Burlington, New Jersey. MET also has sought and gained recognition in many areas of service whererecognition and accreditation of independent laboratories was available,including the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP)for telecommunications and computing equipment, and the American Associationof Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA). It has also received additional accreditationsfrom numerous jurisdictions including states, cities, municipalities, andfederal government agencies including the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Navy,the U.S. Army and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. MET Electrical Testing Company, Inc., (MET) applied to OSHA for recognitionas a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory in April 1988. The applicationwas subsequently revised and additional data provided as requested. Anon-site evaluation was conducted and the results were discussed with theapplicant who responded with appropriate corrective actions and clarificationsto recommendations made as a result of the survey (See Ex. 2B). A finalon-site review report, consisting of the on-site evaluation of MET's testingfacility and administrative and technical practices and the correctiveactions taken by MET in response to this evaluation, and the OSHA staffrecommendation, was subsequently forwarded to the Assistant Secretary fora preliminary finding on the application. A notice of MET's applicationtogether with a positive preliminary finding was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 6, 1988 (53 FR 49258-49259). Interestedparties were invited to submit comments. There were five responses to the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice of the MET application and preliminaryfinding (Docket No. NRTL-1-88). Exhibit 3-5 contained no substantive matter.Exhibits 3-1, 3-2, and 3-3 attested to the credibility of the applicant,agreed with the positive preliminary finding, and recommended recognitionas a nationally recognized testing laboratory. The other comment will bediscussed more fully below. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has evaluated the recordin relation to the regulations set out in 29 CFR 1910.7 and makes the followingfindings: <ITAG tagnum="84">Capability </ITAG>Section 1910.7 (b)(1) states that for each specified item of equipmentor material to be listed, labeled or accepted, the testing laboratory musthave the capability (including proper testing equipment and facilities,trained staff, written testing procedures, and calibration and qualitycontrol programs) to perform appropriate testing. The on-site review report indicates that MET does have testing equipmentand facilities appropriate for the areas of recognition it seeks. The laboratoryhas more than 1800 pieces of test equipment it uses to perform the testingrequired by the standards. The test standards used identify the necessaryparameters required to be measured to provide assurance of product conformanceto a standard; MET's equipment can measure these parameters specified inthe standard. It maintains an inventory list which includes a descriptionof the test equipment, manufacturer and model; the laboratory's identificationnumber; and the calibration status and location of the test equipment.One respondent expressed concern that certain necessary equipment may notbe owned and available at the site (Ex. 3-4, pp. 3-4). MET has stated thatit owns the equipment necessary to perform the tests contemplated in thetest standards for which it seeks recognition except for situations wherethe equipment or materials to be tested, such as large medical X-ray units,require a unique facility or special equipment. OSHA finds this practiceto be acceptable. The Laboratory Division, which is located at the Baltimore, Maryland addressof the applicant, consists of 21 employees, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="15">1_Laboratory Director </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">3_Project Engineers </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">2_Engineers </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">2_Junior Engineers </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">4_Senior Technicians </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">4_Test Technicians </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">2_Group Administrators </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">1_Sales Engineer </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">1_Clerical </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">1_Machinist</ITAG>MET has submitted copies of the job responsibilities and qualificationsfor each of the technical positions listed above and the employees, inOSHA's opinion, appear to be qualified by training or experience for performingtesting in the areas for which MET seeks recognition.MET owns a 22,000 square foot commercial building, 14,000 square feet ofwhich is allocated to product testing and evaluation. Temperature and humidityare closely controlled in rooms used for calibrating test instruments andwhere required by the applicable test standards. Visitor entrance to thefacility is carefully controlled. The facility also has a security alarmsystem and a fire sprinkler system. The physical facilities appear to bemore than adequate for the volume and type of testing for which MET hasrequested recognition. One commentator (Ex. 3-4, p. 3) believed that MET has attempted to covertoo many product categories for the facility, test equipment, and staffresources, and questions the controls that will be implemented to assurethat the other MET facilities (which were not the subject of the MET application)would not be brought into service. The on-site review indicated that thecompany's facilities and personnel can accomplish the services requiredfor their present workload in the product categories for which MET seeksrecognition. In the event that the workload increased, additional resourceswould be needed for staff and program expansion. MET states that it hasno present intention to utilize either its Pittsburgh or Burlington facilitiesto accomplish work under the OSHA recognition system. It further statesthat any future expansion would be accomplished with official notificationto OSHA and an appropriate request for expansion of its recognition. OSHAbelieves that this approach is well within the process contemplated bythe standard. The on-site review report revealed that MET has a comprehensive calibrationprogram for its test equipment. MET maintains a separate calibration laboratoryto calibrate, repair and maintain most of the test equipment used for producttesting. Outside vendor calibration services are used occassionally whenapproved by the Quality Assurance Manager. There is a written equipmentcalibration program which includes periodic calibration, color coded labelsto indicate calibration status, and records of calibration, repairs andmaintenance of test equipment. While MET had no written operating procedures describing the methods andprocedures to be used by personnel to evaluate products under a specifictest standard at the time of the on-site review, it has taken steps todevelop such a formal program. The steps are detailed in the on-site reviewreport which is in the record. OSHA deems these steps to be acceptableand expects that they are being conscientiously implemented. Follow-upreviews will ascertain the status of this program. MET states that it willperform no tests under the OSHA recognition program until the written testprocedures are completed for the particular standard in question. MET has a written quality assurance program including an internal auditprogram. As a result of the on-site review, OSHA believes that the programis adequate considering the present scope of the workload and the technicalexpertise of the personnel. However, OSHA recommended formalizing certainaspects of the program to assure objective evaluations of performance ifthe laboratory expands or the workload increases. Included in the recommendationswas the development of a policy decision handbook to standardize interpretationsof technical and administrative discretionary areas. Type of Testing The standard contemplates that testing done by NRTLs fall into one of twocategories: testing to determine conformance with appropriate test standards,or experimental testing where there might not be one specific test standardcovering the new product or material. MET has applied for recognition inthe first category. Follow-up Procedures Section 1910.7(b)(2) requires that the NRTL shall provide certain follow-upprocedures to the extent necessary for the particular equipment or materialto be listed, labeled or accepted. These include implementation of controlprocedures for identifying the listed or labeled equipment or materials,inspecting the production run at factories to assure conformance with teststandards, and conducting of field inspections to monitor and assure theproper use of the label. One commentator (Ex. 3-4, p. 4) believed thatthere is no indication that ``such a program exists with this applicant''.Prior to testing, MET requires its manufacturer client to sign a follow-upprogram agreement permitting MET to conduct follow-up inspections of listedproducts at the manufacturing site. These follow-up inspections are conductedevery three months; products are selected at random from the productionline or from inventory for inspection and testing to assure continued conformancewith the test standards. The printing and distribution of labels to beaffixed to an approved or listed product is carefully controlled. Unresolveddiscrepancies found during the followup procedures can result in the forfeitureof the right to apply the label, removal of already affixed labels, andpossible recall of products sold with the label.Field inspections may be necessary under various circumstances. The determinationon whether to conduct these field inspections routinely, sporadically,or not at all for a given product, will depend upon the results of thefactory follow-up and other relevant considerations. As an example, fieldinspections may be appropriate when the laboratory has reason to believethat its mark or label is being improperly used. Such belief could resultfrom observed events or information from complainants. Another situationnecessitating a field inspection could arise where it is impractical toconduct regular factory inspections because of a limited production schedule.It is expected that the decision on conducting field inspections will becontinually re-evaluated to fit the circumstances. MET's application demonstratesthis flexible approach to field inspections. It states that ``periodicinspections of the labeled product are performed at the manufacturing facility,distribution point and retail outlets and, if necessary, in our laboratoryin order to assure continued compliance.'' The on-site review demonstrated that MET has experience with a follow-upprogram to correct product problems and insure the integrity of the label.Moreover, OSHA will periodically review the follow-up procedures to evaluatetheir efficacy. Independence Section 1910.7(b)(3) requires that the NRTL be completely independent ofemployers subject to the tested equipment requirements and of any manufactureror vendor of equipment or materials being tested. In its application METindicated that it has a ``professional'' relationship with its clientsand has no economic interest in any of the manufacturers whose productsit tests. Nor does any manufacturer have any economic interest in MET.Moreover, no officer of MET owns any stock in any manufacturer whose productsMET tests. In addition, MET states that, with the exception of the U.S.government, no single client produces revenues greater than 3 percent ofits total corporate income. MET has stated that it will maintain this same level of independence throughoutits existence as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory. Creditable Reports/Complaint Handling Section 1910.7(b)(4) provides that an OSHA recognized NRTL must maintaineffective procedures for producing creditable findings and reports thatare objective and without bias. The laboratory, in order to be recognized,must also maintain effective procedures for handling complaints under afair and reasonable system. The MET application as well as the on-site review report indicate thatMET does maintain effective procedures for producing creditable findingsand reports that are objective. As part of the review, several test reportswere reviewed and found to be consistent with the intent of andSection; 1910.7(b)(4)(i)to produce creditable findings and reports. This requirement is, however,essentially procedural in nature (see 53 FR 12111, 4/12/88). OSHA believesthat its evaluation of MET's capabilities, including its personnel, equipment,facilities, calibration program, and quality assurance program, as wellas its independence, among other things, indicates that there are appropriateprocedures being implemented to produce objective test reports that arewithout bias. The requirement that a laboratory have a fair and reasonable system forhandling complaints was intended to allow interested parties an avenueof redress when, for example, it was believed that an item had been improperlylabeled or that an inappropriate test procedure had been applied. It wasnot intended to interfere with any laboratory's recognized responsibilityto decide whether to approve, list, label, or certify any particular typeof equipment or material which it had tested. Indeed, many of the ANSItest standards include in the preface a statement specifically indicatingthat an item may not be acceptable even though it may meet all the testcriteria. Rather, 29 CFR 1910.7(b)(4)(ii) was intended to help settle complaintsand disputes after an item had been approved, listed, labeled, or certified.MET has a program to assure that the complaints of any interested party,including users of the product, will be fairly handled and resolved. Itsprocedure requires that the complaint first be presented for resolutionin house. If the dispute cannot be resolved, there is a procedure for referringthe issue to an impartial third person for resolution. One respondent (Ex. 3-4, p. 4) objected to MET's dispute handling procedureon the basis that the results would lack consistency as different partieswould be involved and different arbitrators could be selected. The essentialingredient in this requirement is that all interested persons have accessto a dispute handling system which is both ``fair and reasonable'' (cf<T3> ASME</T3> v.<T3> Hydrolevel</T3> 456 U.S. 556, 102 S.Ct. 1935 (1982)). Arbitrationand mediation are long recognized and satisfactory methods of resolvingdisputes between private parties and are consistent with 29 CFR 1910.7(b)(4)(ii).Test Standards Section 1910.7 requires that a nationally recognized testing laboratoryuse ``appropriate test standards''. The standard defines an appropriatetest standard as a document which specifies the safety requirements for specific equipment or a class of equipment and is recognized in the UnitedStates as providing an adequate level of safety, compatible with and maintainedcurrent with periodic revisions of applicable national codes, and developedby a standards developing organization under a system of providing forbroad input from interested parties (andSection; 1910.7(c) (1), (2), and(3)). The standard also designates as ``appropriate'' any standard thatis currently designated as an ANSI safety designated product standard oran ASTM test standard used for evaluation of products or materials. (SeeandSection; 1910.7(c)(4)). Laboratories may also use other test standardsthat the Assistant Secretary of Labor has evaluated to determine that suchstandard provides an adequate level of safety. (See andSection; 1910.7(d)).In this case, MET has indicated that it will use the ANSI test standardslisted below. These are ``appropriate test standards'' within the meaningof andSection; 1910.7 (b) and (c).One of the commentators (Ex. 3-4, pp. 2-3) stated that the test standards``are listed without their date of issue'' and raised the spectre of inconsistency;they believe ``there is need for assurance of testing to latest versionsof the standard''. MET indicated that part of its testing includes a verificationthat the standard and reference standards being tested to are the currentand most up to-date-standards (see on-site review report). The applicationand accompanying documentation also addresses the issue of standards revisions.The procedures identified by MET indicate its capability to test to thelatest revision of the test standard. This is the same level of assurancethat would be required of other recognized laboratories. The proceduresto be followed in the event of test standard changes are adequately statedin Appendix A of 29 CFR 1910.7. Other Issues  One of the respondents (Ex. 3-4) raised a number of issues that were notdirectly relevant to the issue of MET meeting the definition of an NRTLas set forth in 29 CFR 1910.7. These comments were general criticisms ofthe standard. For example, one such comment focused on the need to designateand use a single test standard for each product. (Ex. 3-4, pp. 1-2). Thisissue had been raised by the same respondent during the rulemaking proceedingand was discussed and resolved in the preamble to the final rule (see 53FR 12108-12109, 4/12/88). Since these general issues were raised and resolvedduring the promulgation of the standard it is not now timely to commenton them. Other comments (Ex. 3-4, p. 3) indicated that the ``handling of test standardsfor components raises * * * questions about applicability''. The NRTL Program does not address whether one NRTL must accept anotherNRTL's listing or recognition of a component. Instead, the laboratory listingthe overall product acceptance, listing, or recognition, is responsiblefor assuring that the components used in the product meet the applicabletest standards. If usage or test information is not  available, retestingmay be prudent. Another issue raised by a commentator (Ex. 3-4, pp. 5-6) concerned testand evaluation consistency among all NRTLs. This would be an ideal state which may be achieved in the future when laboratoriesexchange information on a regular basis. This is not being accomplishedby the presently nationally recognized testing laboratories in their standardsor interpretations. In addition, consistent interpretation of standardsbetween the two presently recognized Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratoriesis not the case in every instance. <ITAG tagnum="84">Final Decision and Order </ITAG>Based upon a preponderance of the evidence resulting from an examinationof the complete application, the supporting documentation, the OSHA stafffinding including the on-site review report, and the comments presentedduring the public review and comment period, OSHA finds that the MET ElectricalTesting Company, Inc., has met the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.7 to berecognized by OSHA as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory to testand certify certain equipment or materials. Pursuant to authority in 29 CFR 1910.7, it is ordered that the MET ElectricalTesting Company, Inc., be recognized as a Nationally Recognized TestingLaboratory subject to the conditions listed below.This recognition is limited to equipment or materials which, under 29 CFRPart 1910, require testing, listing, labeling, approval, acceptance, orcertification, by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory. This recognitionis limited to the use of the following test standards for the testing andcertification of equipment or materials included within the scope of thesestandards: The listing is by MET product catagory. MET has stated that all the standardsin these catagories are used to test equipment or materials which can beused in environments under OSHA's jurisdiction. <ITAG tagnum="81">(1) Audio/Video Equipment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;1270_Radio Receivers, Audio Systems, and Accessories</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;1410_Television Receivers and High-Voltage VideoProducts</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">(2) Energy Monitoring Equipment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI C12.1_Code for Electricity Meters </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">IEEE/ANSI C57.13_Terminology and Test Code for Instrument Transformers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">(3) Food Preparation Equipment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;197_Commercial Electric Cooking Appliances </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;471_Commercial Refrigerators and Freezers </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;982_Motor-Operated Household Food Preparing Machines</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">(4) Heating, Ventilation Equipment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;465_Central Cooling Air Conditioners </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;484_Room Air Conditioners </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;499_Electric Heating Appliances </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;559_Heat Pumps </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;883_Fan-Coil Units and Room Fan-Heater Units </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;1025_Electric Air Heaters </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;1042_Electric Baseboard Heating Equipment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">(5) Industrial Control Equipment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;508_Electric Industrial Control Equipment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">(6) Lighting Fixtures</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;153_Portable Electric Lamps </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;676_Underwater Lighting Fixtures </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">UL andplusmin;1570_Fluorescent Lighting Fixtures </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;1571_Incandescent Lighting Fixtures</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">(7) Medical and Dental Equipment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;187_X-Ray Equipment </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">UL andplusmin;544_Electric Medical and Dental Equipment </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;1069_Hospital Signaling and Nurse-Call System</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">(8) Motor Operated Equipment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;73_Electric Motor-Operated Appliances </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;507_Electric Fans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;705_Power Ventilators</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">(9) Office/Business Equipment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;114_Electric Office Appliances and Business Equipment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">UL andplusmin;478_Information-Processing and Business Equipment </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">UL andplusmin;1459_Telephone Equipment</ITAG>The MET Electrical Testing Company, Inc., also must abide by the followingconditions of its recognition, in addition to those already required by29 CFR 1910.7: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration shall be allowed accessto MET's facilities and records for purposes of ascertaining continuingcompliance with the terms of its recognition and to investigate as OSHAdeems necessary; If MET has reason to doubt the efficacy of any test standard it is usingunder this program, it shall promptly inform the test standard developingorganization of this fact and provide that organization with appropriaterelevant information upon which its concerns are based; MET shall not engage in or permit others to engage in any misrepresentationof the scope or conditions of its recognition.
