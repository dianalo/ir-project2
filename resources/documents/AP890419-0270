Many of the recommendations contained in a report by the ChicagoMercantile Exchange's Special Committee to Review Trading Practiceswere under consideration earlier, said Leo Melamed, vice chairmanof the committee.   ``But the time frame was compressed as a result of theinvestigation,'' Melamed told a news confererence where theproposals were unveiled.   John Geldermann, chairman of the special committee, said thepublic perception of the exchange has suffered in the three monthssince disclosure of the undercover FBI probe. He said it wasimportant to release the recommendations to maintain investorconfidence.   ``The failure to respond quickly would have shown a lack ofleadership,'' said Geldermann, who also is chairman of the Merc'sBoard of Governors. The recommendations will be submitted to thatboard for a decision expected within 60 days.   The most imporant restriction would be limits on dual trading, acontroversial practice, enables a trader to trade his own accountat the same time he handles customers' accounts.   While the practice is allowed by many financial exchanges, manyconsider it susceptible to abuse because it allows unscrupuloustraders to allocate profitable deals to their own accounts and dumplosing trades on customers.   The nine-member committee was appointed in late January,following disclosures that the federal government was investigatingallegations involving the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade.   The federal probe concerns allegations that as many as 100brokers at the two sprawling exchanges systematically cheatedinvestors out of millions of dollars through illegal tradingpractices.   No indictments have been announced yet, but as many as 200subpeonas reportedly have been issued to traders and firms at theexchanges.   Some market experts viewed the formation of the specialcommittee as part of the futures industry's effort to hold the lineagainst further government regulation, which it historically hasrejected as cumbersome and unneeded.   Melamed said he made the rounds Tuesday in Washington andcarried the committee's reports to the Commodity Futures TradingCommission, the federal agency charged with regulating theindustry, as well as key House and Senate members with agricultureor industry oversight responsibilities.   ``It was received extremely favorably by everyone ... No onementioned anything beyond what we were saying,'' he added.   Proponents argue that dual trading increases the amount ofbuyers and sellers because traders can continue doing business whenthey don't have outside orders.   But the Merc committee, with few exceptions, recommended dualtrading be banned from futures contracts in cases where marketvolume already is substantial.   The panel also recommended the Merc's full-time floorsurveillance team be doubled from four to eight staff members andadopt specific guidelines _ with penalties ranging from a 30-daytrading suspension to expulsion _ for rule violations involvingfinancial injury to public customers.   Among other recommendations:   _More extensive screening of membership applicants.   _Members of a broker association should not be allowed toexecute personal trades against orders by members of the brokergroup.   _Addition of one non-Merc member to all major disciplinarycommittees. ``The criticism is that we're too clubby,'' saidMelamed. ``This would enable the public to view the process and seewe are open-handed.''   _Daily computerized trade information for members covering allactivity from the previous day.   Asked whether he expected the recommendations to stave offfurther government intervention into industry business, Melamedreplied, ``Self-regulation requires that you deserveself-regulation. And in order to deserve it, you must prove thatyou're responsible.''</TEXT></DOC>
