The southern flank nations have historically received preferential treatment, not only within the NATO structure, but also by unilateral U.S. support as they have been recognized as being economically distressed. Unfortunately, as has been the case with others who have become dependent upon the largess of others, they now see the contributions of their benefactors as a right they deserve.    The U.S. should remind these nations that they have more to lose from a reduction of U.S. and NATO support in their areas than we have, and be prepared to withdraw our forces and support should they persist in trying to blackmail us into providing their defense. After almost 40 years of support to these nations, it is time they start to bear the costs for their defense.    Col. W.H. Kestner, U.S. Army (Ret.)    Charleston, S.C.</TEXT></DOC>
