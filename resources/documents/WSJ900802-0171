No further talks have been scheduled and neither sidewould predict how long the strike would last.</LP><TEXT>   The company said union demands would have led to anoverall $40-per hour increase in benefits and wages over thefour-year contract.   But David Foster, a negotiator for the workers, said uniondemands amounted to about a $12-per-hour increase over fouryears and added that the company did not respond to threesubsequent union offers. &quot;We're waiting to negotiate,&quot; hesaid.   Mr. Foster said workers currently earn an average of$13.70 an hour including incentive pay, about the same levelthey were paid in 1982.   For Cleveland-Cliffs, a prolonged strike could bedevastating. The two mines, in Empire and Tilden, account fora large share of the company's business, with a combinedannual capacity of 16 million tons. The strike could alsohurt other company operations, which support the primary ironore business.   &quot;It will be a very expensive strike,&quot; particularly if itlasts for more than a week or two, said Harry W. Millis, ananalyst at Cleveland's McDonald andamp; Co. Both mines wereproducing and shipping at near capacity, Mr. Millis added, sothey won't be able to make up for lost output.   The two mines, which are owned by a group that includes aCleveland-Cliffs subsidiary and steel companies, produced 8.3million tons of iron ore pellets in the first seven months ofthis year.   A company spokesman said the last strike againstCleveland-Cliffs was in 1977. The company, which manages fourother mines, posted second-quarter earnings of $14.1 million,or $1.21 per share, on revenue of $89.3 million.</TEXT></DOC>
