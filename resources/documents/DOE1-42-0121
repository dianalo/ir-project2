The roadwaywas driven by a 4PP-2 heading machine through argillite-aleurolite rockwith a uniaxial compressive strength of 7-12 MPa. The roadway cross sectionwas 15.5 m{sup 2} and AP-3 steel arch supports were installed. Rock movementwas assessed using surveying reference points and an RVSh-2M radiowavemeasuring unit. The zone of fractured rock was found to begin at theface and increase to 4 m at 80 m from the face along the roadway. TheRVSh-2M device identified artificial fissure zones at depths of up to4 m into the rock. There were 2 such zones (0.8-1.8 and 2.9-3.7 m). Atgreater depths into the rock 2 more such zones were identified visually,the deepest being 7-8 m into the rock. The rock was subject to brittlefracture, creating zones of fissuring separated by 1-1.5 m blocks ofunbroken rock. 4 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
