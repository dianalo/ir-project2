Study on load-deformationprocess and cyclic loading test have been carried out by means of electro-hydraulicservo controlled universal testing machine to analyze the conversioncharacteristics of elastic deformation and brittle failure of rock andcoal in the seam. Major causes of coal bursting in the seam have beenexplored to provide scientific basis for choosing proper measures toprevent and control coal bursting.</TEXT></DOC>
