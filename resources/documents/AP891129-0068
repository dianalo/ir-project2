Anschluss is the Germanword for annexation and is used to describe the Nazi takeover ofAustria in 1938.   After Kohl made his proposal on Tuesday, Communist Party leaderEgon Krenz said reunification could conjure fears of a Nazi-eraGermany, ``and I know no one in the world who would like such aGermany.'' But Krenz welcomed Kohl's call for closer cooperationbetween the Germanys.   Many Europeans worry that with its economic and political might,a reunited Germany of 80 million people would dominate thecontinent. Germany was divided into two states after the Nazidefeat in World War II.   The prospect of reunification seemed distant less than a monthago, but sweeping changes in East Germany have revived the idea.   With East Germans disillusioned with Communist rule fleeing indroves and taking to the streets bythe hundreds of thousands, theparty leadership ousted hard-liner Erich Honecker last month andlaunched a radical program of reforms with the promise of freeelections.   The opening of the country's borders on Nov. 9 gave East Germansunrestricted freedom to travel to West Germany for the first timesince the Berlin Wall was built in 1961.   Some people in both countries have called for reunification, anidea consistently rejected by East Germany's leaders.   Krenz emphasized the need for two ``sovereign, independentGerman states.''   ``A unity of Germany isn't on the agenda,'' he told WestGermany's ARD television network.   However, he did not rule out a confederation, or partnership,between the two Germanys, that Kohl promoted. Krenz said talk ofsuch an arrangement ``requires more time.''   Wolfgang Meyer, the East German government spokesman, saidKohl's proposal for eventual reunification went ``beyond realitiesand could easily lead to irritation ... by not observing thesovereignty and independence of the two German states.''   In a statement carried by the official news agency ADN, Meyeralso said Kohl's proposals for cooperation contained ``interestingstarting points for negotiations.''   A group of leading East German intellectuals also rejectedreunification and expressed fear of their country ``beingpocketed'' by West Germany. They said East Germany should remain aseparate socialist state.   The dissidents, including prominent authors Stefan Heym andChrista Wolf, started a petition drive Tuesday calling for anational ``vote of confidence'' in socialism.   ADN said today that Krenz had signed a petition and told thedissidents in a letter: ``We have the historic duty to preservethis country with its anti-fascist ideals and traditions as asocialist alternative within German development.''   In his speech to Parliament on Tuesday, Kohl sought to allayfears about a reunited Germany, saying: ``The Germans ... will be adividend for a Europe that is coming together, and never again athreat.''   He did not offer a timetable and made it clear it could takeyears to form a federation. Kohl said German reunification can onlyoccur as the overall East-West division of Europe is overcome.   Kohl proposed creation of joint governmental and parliamentarycommittees whose purpose would be ``permanent consultation''between the two Germanys on economic, environmental, cultural, andscientific matters.   In other developments Tuesday, ADN outlined a new travelproposal that is aimed at controlling some of the economic damageEast Germany faces by having an open border with its richerneighbor.   Since East Germany opened the borders, illegal currency tradinghas intensified and black-market dealings have been rampant.   Under the proposal, East Germans can have their passportsrevoked if they are found to be working abroad or earning anyincome without the consent of the East German government.   ``Every citizen of East Germany has the right to travel abroadany time and to obtain a passport for this purpose,'' states theproposed law that will be discussed at a parliamentary sessionbeginning Friday.   The government last week imposed new customs controls aimed atintercepting huge stashes of currency or subsidized consumer goodsheaded West in the bags of East German travelers.   In the first publication of official figures, the CommunistParty newspaper Neues Deutschland said today that 3.4 millionpeople had left East Germany during 40 years of Communist rule.West German estimates say the number is far higher. East Germany'scurrent population is about 16.5 million.</TEXT></DOC>
