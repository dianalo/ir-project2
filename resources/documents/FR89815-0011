Light, Office of LegalCounsel, EEOC, 1801 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20507 (202) 663-4690.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Section 7(e)(2) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C.626(e)(2), provides for tolling the statute of limitations codified insection 6 of the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, 255,\1\<NOTE/> for up to one year while the Commission ``is attempting toeffect voluntary compliance with the requirements of this Act through informalmethods of conciliation, conference, and persuasion pursuant to subsection(b).'' Subsection (b) of section 7 is the provision that requires the Commissionto engage in conciliation, conference, and persuasion efforts before itcan institute court actions under the ADEA.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Section 6 of the Portal-to-Portal Act is made applicableby section 7(e)(1) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. 626(e)(1), to all age discriminationlitigation whether brought by the Commission or by private individuals.<ITAG tagnum="28">Similarly, section 7(b), 29 U.S.C. 626(b), specifically provides forenforcement of the ADEA in accordance with section 16 of the Fair LaborStandards Act, 29 U.S.C. 216, which grants litigation authority for bothemployee suits section 16(b)) and government suits (section 16(c)). Thus,section 7(b) provides both a government and private right of action.</ITAG>In a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) piublished in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of Thursday, March 9, 1989 (54 FR 10025), theCommission expressed its belief that Congress neither required nor intendedthat the one-year tolling period provided by section 7(e)(2) be appliedonly to suits brought by the government. This position was taken afterthoroughly considering the language of the statutory provision, the overallstatutory scheme favoring voluntary compliance, its legislative backgroundand the court discussions on the subject of section 7(e)(2) tolling. Followingthe publication of the NPRM, several comments were received from individualsand organizations. Although a majority of the comments submitted opposedthe NPRM position, the Commission continues to believe that once section7(b) conciliation, conference, and persuasion have been commenced by theEEOC, the period of tolling applies regardless of whether the Commissionor a private party files an ADEA suit after the attempt at informal resolutionfails.None of the comments raised arguments not already considered in the NPRM.The comments who opposed the position put forward in the NPRM believedgenerally that the statutory language and legislative history argued forapplication of section 7(e)(2) exclusively to Commission lawsuits. Thesecommenters also generally felt that the Commission's position would, ineffect, act to extend the Act's statute of limitations without this havingbeen intended by Congress. In addition, some of these commenters expresseda view that the court decisions cited and discussed in the NPRM were morepersuasive for a limitation of tolling to government actions than for applicationto private lawsuits. Lastly, one commenter urged that the 1979 letter ofAssistant Labor Secretary Elisburg (noted in the NPRM at footnote 6), opiningthat section 7(e)(2) tolling applies only to government suits, was morecontemporaneous with the 1978 ADEA amendments which added that sectionand more persuasive in its reasoning and conclusion.The Commission has carefully considered these arguments and continues tobelieve that the application of tolling to private lawsuits as well asgovernment actions is most consistent with Congress' express preferencein the ADEA for voluntary settlement of age discrimination claims. Thisview also recognizes the fact that unsuccessful section 9(b) conciliationmay not always result in the Commission filing suit. As we stated in theNPRM, limiting tolling during section 7(b) conciliation to the government'sright of action encourages charging parties to file protective suits, therebyderailing the voluntary settlement process, and may also reward employersfor not engaging in prompt or serious conciliation efforts.\2\<NOTE/> Thus, an interpretation applying section 7(e)(2) tollingto private as well as government actions is fully consistent with the ADEA'sstatutory scheme.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ For example, there may be persons with meritorious claimswho, at some point beyond the applicable statute of limitations but withinthe 1-year tolling period, learn that the government is not going to litigateon their behalf. It would not be in keeping with simple notions of fairness,nor with the concept that aggrieved individuals act as ``private attorneysgeneral'' under the ADEA to interpret section 7(e) as tolling the timeframes solely for government suits.<ITAG tagnum="28">As one commenter emphasized:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">The ADEA, like Title VII, was designed to promote joint enforcementefforts between the government and private litigants. This complimentaryscheme of government enforcement and private ``attorneys general'' worksbest when the conciliation mandated by the ADEA applies with equal force,and with like consequences, to all litigants.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">The extension of section 7(e)(2) tolling to private litigants is importantfor several practical reasons. During conciliation, plaintiffs are unlikelyto file suit for two reasons. First, they justifiably hope that the mattercan be resolved short of expensive litigation. Second, they continue tohope that if conciliation fails, the Commission will initiate suit on theirbehalf. The extension of the tolling provision to private litigants maximizesthe potential benefits of section 7(b) conciliation by giving the Commissionan uninterrupted chance at voluntary resolution. However, in many cases,the Commission's conciliation efforts under section 7(b) extend beyondthe two year statute of limitations for filing a private suit. Unfortunately,if the Commission decides not to file suit after the two year statute oflimitations has run, the aggreived parties are out of luck.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">On the other hand, the absence of tolling impairs both effective conciliationand the overall enforcement of the ADEA. Private litigants faced with theexpiration of the two-year statute of limitations have two unpalatablealternatives. They can initiate a ``protective suit,'' but in so doingmay undermine the conciliation efforts of the Commission. An employer maybe unwilling to resolve a matter with the Commission upon which privatelitigation is pending. At the same time, a ``protective suit'' may deprivethe Commission of its prosecutorial discretion. Commission practice hasbeen to generally avoid government suits which duplicate previously initiatedprivate actions.</ITAG>There is nothing in the statutory language of section 7(e)(2) or its legislativehistory which would contradict or prohibit an interpretation applying tollingto private litigants. The Conference Committee report stated that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Senate amendment amends section 7(e) of the act to provide thatthe statute of limitations as provided in section 6 of the Portal-to-PortalAct of 1947 shall be tolled (for a period not exceeding 2 years [conferenceagreement substituted 1 year]) during the period in which the Secretaryof Labor [now EEOC] is attempting to effect voluntary compliance pursuantto section 7(b). This amendment does not apply to conciliation requiredby section 7(d). House Conf. Report No. 95-950, p. 13, reprinted in 1978U.S. Code Cong. and Admin. News, p. 534.\3\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ One commenter argued that some legislative history indicatedotherwise:<ITAG tagnum="28">During the debate prior to House agreement to the Conference Report,Representative Albert H. Quie, ranking minority member of the Committeeon Education and Labor, which reported H. 5383, and a member of the conferencecommittee, explained the Senate amendment to the House. RepresentativeQuie explained that ``[t]he combined effect of [the] conciliation requirementand the limitations statute is to require the Secretary to fulfill hisresponsibility to achieve conciliation before legal action is begun.''124 Cong. Rec. H 2272 (March 21, 1978). Representative Quie must have beenspeaking of a legal action by the Secretary (now EEOC), since as the NPRMexplained, andSection; 7(d) conciliation cannot delay a private suit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Representative Quie's subsequent statements made it clear that theSenate amendment was directed solely towards suits filed by the government.He explained that in large cases such as complex class actions, it is difficultif not impossible to complete conciliation within the given time limit.He went on to say, ``</ITAG><T3>The Secretary</T3> thus may be forced into court prematurely simplyto protect his right of action. This tolling provision helps to alleviatethis problem by allowing <T3>the Secretary</T3> up to an additional year before having to file suit.''<T3>Id</T3>. (emphasis supplied).This discussion does not limit the benefits of section 7(b) tolling exclusivelyto an action filed by the enforcement agency, it simply requires 7(b),as opposed to 7(d), conciliation efforts as a prerequisite for tolling.\4\<NOTE/> As was articulated as dictum in <T3>Fulton </T3>v. <T3>NCR Corp</T3>., 472 F. Supp. 377, 382 (W.D. Va. 1979):<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Section 7(d) conciliation simply requires the EEOC, uponreceiving a charge, to promptly notify all persons named as prospectivedefendants and to promptly seek to eliminate any alleged unlawful practiceby informal methods of conciliation, conference and persuasion. It is theinformal predetermination action that promptly follows the filing of acharge and in no event can delay a private suit by more than 60 days.<ITAG tagnum="28">Section 7(b) conciliation follows written notice from the EEOC toprospective defendant(s) that it is prepared to commence conciliation pursuantto that section of the Act and is required before the Commission itselfcan file suit. Commission regulations provide that section 7(b) conciliationmay be commenced whenever the Commission has a reasonable basis to concludethat a violation of the ADEA has occurred or will occur (ordinarily issuedin the form of a Letter of Determination), 29 CFR 1626.12(b). </ITAG><T3>See also </T3>H.R.

It may mean only that section 7(d) conciliation will workto toll the limitations period for no ADEA action, while section 7(b) conciliationsmay work to toll the limitations period for any ADEA suit, whether broughtunder section 7(b) [by the government] or section 7(c) [by a private litigant].(Emphasis in original) \5\<NOTE/> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Two other courts have stated in <T3>dicta</T3> in private ADEA actions that tolling under section 7(e)(2)was available for the time spent in conciliation. <T3>See Miller </T3>v. <T3>International Telephone and Telegraph Co., </T3>755 F.2d 20, 24 (2dCir. 1985), <T3>cert. denied,</T3> 474 U.S. 1015 (1985); and <T3>Vuksta </T3>v. <T3>Bethlehem Steel Corp., </T3>540 F.

Four courts, including one court of appeals, have reached a different conclusion,but without a thorough analysis of the question. In <T3>Heiar </T3>v. <T3>Crawford County</T3>, 746 F.2d 1190, 1196 (7th Cir. 1984), <T3>cert. denied,</T3> 472 U.S. 1027 (1985), the court, in an opinion byJudge Posner, stated, in <T3>dictum</T3>:<ITAG tagnum="21">The conciliation referred to [in section 79e)(2)]_conciliation undersection [7](b)_is that preceding suits by the EEOC. Conciliation in privateactions is provided for separately in section [7](d) * * *. The point isnot that there are different forms of conciliation, it is that only theEEOC can use the period of conciliation to toll the statute of limitations.</ITAG>In <T3>Leite </T3>v. <T3>Kennecott Copper Corp., </T3>558 F. Supp. 1170, 1172-73 (D.Mass.),<T3>aff'd without opinion,</T3> 720 F.2d 658 (1st Cir. 1983), the courtheld that, notwithstanding the Commission's advice that its conciliationefforts would extend the statute of limitations for a charging party'sprivate suit, tolling was inapplicable. According to the court, the Commission'sadvice ``misstate[d] the law'' because sec. 7(e)(2)'s ``reference to [sec7](b) makes clear [that] this tolling provision applies only to the conciliationprovision efforts preceding the institution of legal action by the [government],not to those that might precede a private civil action.'' 558 F. Supp.1173 andamp; n.1. Finally, in <T3>Hovey </T3>v. <T3>Lutheran Medical Center, </T3>516 F. Supp. 554, 556 (E.D.N.Y. 1981),the court, in holding that tolling was not available in a private suit,stated that ``the tolling provision of [sec. 7](e)(2) applies only to theconciliatory efforts required by [sec. 7](b) preceding the institutionof legal action by the Secretary [; it] does not refer to conciliationbefore a private civil action.'' \6\<NOTE/> <T3>See also Taylor </T3>v. <T3>Battelle Columbus Laboratories,</T3> 680 F. Supp. 1165 (E.D. Ohio,1988) (citing <T3>Heiar</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>Hovey and Leite</T3> cite to and erroneously rely upon the decisionin <T3>Fulton </T3>v. <T3>NCR. Corp.,</T3> discussed earlier, which supports the opposite view,i.e., that tolling is available in a private action. The Commission believes that these decisions are unpersuasive and incorrecton the issue of tolling.\7\<NOTE/> The decisions discussed the issue, largely in dicta, onlyin a brief and conclusory manner without articulated reasoning and usingas authority the same legislative history discussed above that clearlydoes not mandate that tollling only applies to government actions. To thecontrary, the Commission views the legislative history and general structureof the ADEA enforcement scheme as evidencing Congress' understanding thatsection 7(b) conciliation and section 7(e)(2) tolling may occur in caseswhere the Commission does not ultimately bring suit. A clear indicationof this fact is the statement in the Conference Committee Report that tollingunder section 7(e)(2) ``begin[s] when the Department of Labor [now EEOC]states, in a letter to the prospective defendant(s) that it is preparedto commence conciliation pursuant to section 7(b) of the act.'' H.R. Conf.Rep. No. 950, 95 Cong., 2d Sess. 13 (1978). Had Congress intended section7(e)(2) tolling to be limited to the government, it could easily have saidso. Instead of such a limitation, Congress stated in that section that``the statute of limitations,'' which applies to both private and governmentactions, ``shall be tolled.''\8\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ By letter dated February 26, 1979, the Department of Labor,then responsible for ADEA enforcement, expressed the view that section7(e) tolling was limited to the government's right of action. For the reasonsdiscussed in the text, the Commission rejects this view. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ As one commentator noted, where the statute is clear onits face, there is no need to resort to legislative history to deciphercongressional intent. <T3>See, e.g., United Air Lines </T3>v. <T3>McMann, </T3>434 U.S. 192, 198-99 (1977); <T3>Brennan </T3>v. <T3>Taft Broadcasting company, </T3>500 F.2d 212, 216-17 (5th Cir. 1974).Therefore, the Commission believes that Congress intended the one-yeartolling period provided by section 7(e)(2) to apply to both Commissionand private litigation. Such a view is consistent with effective and efficientenforcement of the ADEA. Thus, the Commission hereby provides notice thatit is modifying its procedural regulation at 29 CFR 1626.15(b) to add thefollowing statement at the conclusion of this subsection:This tolling period pursuant to section 7(e)(2) is applicable to both Commissionand private party litigation.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Impact Analysis_Classification-Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The rule in this document is not classified as a ``major rule'' under ExecutiveOrder 12291 on Federal Regulations, because it is not likely to resultin (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovationor the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.
