Last year, the government gambled it could achieve peace byappeasing the rebel Tamil Tigers. That gamble failed last week whengovernment and military officials said more than 130 unarmedpolicemen were massacred by the rebels and hundreds more weremissing.   After the Tigers broke an earlier truce on Monday, at least 376people were killed in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, according toreports compiled by witnesses, military sources and rebelofficials. The government has not given a comprehensive death toll.   Saturday's cease-fire came after two days of negotiations.Military officials in Colombo and a Tiger spokesman in the northernrebel stronghold of Jaffna said it took effect throughout the northand east as scheduled at 6 p.m. Residents in the eastern town ofBatticaloa, where the trouble started when the Tigers captured thepolice station Monday, confirmed the shooting had stopped.   The Tigers were patrolling Batticaloa, according to theresidents who were contacted by telephone from Colombo, 135 milesto the southwest. They declined to give further details and spokeon condition of anonymity out of fear for their safety.   For the past 13 months, President Ranasinghe Premadasa'sgovernment and Tiger leaders had been negotiating on apower-sharing arrangment designed to draw the guerrillas away fromthe separatist campaign they launched in 1983 and into politics.   The government let the rebels assume many military and civilpowers. But its trust was shattered by the Tigers' methodicalattacks in the past week in the north and east. The Tigers overranat least 20 police stations staffed by officers whose orders wereto surrender, not shoot, and shot and killed some of their captives.   A few hours before the cease-fire was announced, Premadasareferred to the Tigers as ``terrorists'' _ a sharp departure fromhis previous conciliatory efforts.   He warned that unless the attacks stopped ``they will have toface the consequences and face the same fate'' as Sinhaleseextremists whose leaders were decimated by the government lastwinter.   Even before the attacks, there had been signs of trouble. TheTigers, consisting largely of teen-age guerrillas, had grownincreasingly bold in the last few months, extracting ``taxes'' fromlocal businesses and telling the army and police where they couldand could not go.   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,claim the Sinhalese majority discriminate against them in jobs andeducation.   After the massacres of the policemen, the army and the Tigersbattled for five days for control of key towns in the north andalong the eastern sea coast.   When the Tigers captured the police station in Batticaloa, theyallowed its 300 men to take refuge at an air force base or withRoman Catholic priests.   The government, perhaps reassured by that, told police tosurrender rather than fight if their stations were attacked.   That was what police did at Kalmunai, 22 miles south ofBatticaloa. Of the 115 policeman on duty Monday night, only onelived to tell what had happened.   The sole known survivor, a 23-year-old officer named PiyeratnaRanaweera, said all 115 were blindfolded, loaded into three buses,taken into the jungle, forced to lie face-down on the ground andsprayed with bullets from T-56 assault rifles.   Then shots were fired at close range into their heads, Ranaweerasaid in an interview at Kandy General Hospital.   His left arm broken by rifle fire and his left ear grazed by abullet, he said he crawled out of the heap of bodies after theTigers left.   After a 12-hour, 14-mile walk during which he fainted at leasttwice, he reached government lines and was flown to Kandy, in thecenter of the island.   Altogether, about 800 policemen surrendered to the Tigers,according to the Defense Ministry. The government says it has nofirm information on their fates.   ``We still do not have orders to shoot,'' said an officer atAmpara, 13 miles southwest of Kalmunai. ``We don't care aboutorders. If we come under fire, we'll shoot.''</TEXT></DOC>
