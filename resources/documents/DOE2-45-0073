Increasein its use is expected to continue, with power generation as the majorapplication area. The merit in price over petroleum is the main causefor the increased usage. Furthermore, coal has many other merits suchas far larger reserves. Coal production in 1987 was 12,570,000 tons whichwas less than 1986 by 17.3%. Production efficiency was, however, 105.8t/person/month which was larger than that of the previous year by 12.4t/person/month. The improvement was attributable to the progress of mechanizationas well as the closing of inefficient coal mines. Explanation was madeon safety measurement, supervising and guidance system, safety training,maintenance of safety equipment, performance of safety works, and developmentof safety techniques. The expected coal reserve of the world is 9.9 billiontons, and the recoverable reserve is 730,800 million tons. Japanese enterprisesparticipate in the development operations for overseas coal in Australiaand Canada. The product from the operation now amounts to about 30% ofthe total import. (1 tab)</TEXT></DOC>
