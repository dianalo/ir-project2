The man-made mineral fibers are glass wool, rock wool, slag wool and ceramic, an agency spokesman said. A further finding determined that glass filament could not be classified, meaning that the panel &quot;did not know&quot; what threat if any it posed, he said.    The organization, which is affiliated with the World Health Organization, supplies international and national authorities with scientific data that can assist them in making risk assessments. It doesn't make recommendations on future action.    The agency evaluates risk according to five categories: cancer causing; a probable threat; a possible threat; not classifiable; and no threat. The categorization of a &quot;possible threat&quot; implies that the product &quot;could give rise to concern and that studies should be extended,&quot; the spokesman said.    About 20 scientists, industrial-health specialists and observers from international organizations and industrial associations attended an eight-day conference that ended this week. A summary of their findings will be published in early 1988. The discussions centered on two studies -- a European report by the agency and an American contribution from Philip Enterline, a University of Pittsburgh epidemiologist. </TEXT></DOC>
