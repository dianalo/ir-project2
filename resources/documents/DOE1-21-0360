Most supercomputers are programmed in some higher level language,commonly Fortran; all supercomputer vendors provide Fortran compilersthat detect parallelism and generate parallel code to take advantageof the architecture of their machines. This article discusses some ofthe common (and not so common) features that compilers for vector ormultiprocessor computers must have in order to successfully generateparallel code. Many examples are given that are related to the generictypes of machines to which they apply. Where appropriate, the authorsrelate these parallel compiler optimizations to those used in standardcompilers.</TEXT></DOC>
