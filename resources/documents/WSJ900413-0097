A report by Rand Corp. bolsters views by Bushadministration Moscow-watchers that the Soviet army, whichnow stands almost alone in Eastern Europe as a result of thecollapse of the Warsaw Pact, is reeling from widespreadhomelessness among retired officers, desertions amongdraftees and turmoil within the ranks of its active officers.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There is no doubt the Soviet military is under a greatdeal of stress,&quot; says Henry S. Rowen, assistant secretary ofdefense for international security affairs.   The upheaval comes as the Red Army is being asked to takeon a heavier burden in carrying out internal missions,including controlling riots and other disturbances in ethnicrepublics and protecting nuclear-weapons sites. Some U.S.officials believe Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev'sgrowing reliance on the army to quell disturbances has giventhe military a stronger hand in his government. For instance,they believe dissatisfaction within the military is forcingcivilian leaders to resubmit military-backed proposals,including proposed limits on sea-launched nuclear missiles,and to slow talks in Vienna on conventional-arms control.   &quot;Who would we turn to if we were told that Canada andMexico had just turned communist and the state of Florida wasabout to secede?&quot; asked one analyst, seeking an analogy toMr. Gorbachev's position.   Some U.S. officials question how much support the militarywill give Mr. Gorbachev. The report says there are signs thatsome officers have &quot;increasingly tended to distancethemselves&quot; from the Soviet leader, even though many of themare younger officers who originally supported his reforms.   The report says a &quot;staggering&quot; number of officers arehomeless after leaving the military, many of them uprooted asa result of Soviet cuts in forces in Eastern Europe and alongthe Chinese border. The report also asserts, &quot;a powerfuldemographic shift&quot; is filling the bottom ranks of the armywith Moslem draftees, many of whom speak little Russian.   Signs of the military's crisis, especially the officerhousing problems, have been appearing almost daily in theSoviet military press. For example, retired Navy Captain V.Shatskiy complained in the military newspaper &quot;Red Star&quot; lastmonth that he hasn't received his pension and can't find ajob. Because an apartment promised by the government nevermaterialized, Capt. Shatskiy said, &quot;I am sitting on suitcaseswith my two children and I do not know what to do.&quot; Since hehas no home, he added, local civilian authorities threatenedhim and his wife with violating the Soviet Union's internalpassport law.   According to Red Star, there were 170,500 homelessmilitary families as of Jan. 1, including over 10,000 inMoscow alone. The great majority of them were retiredofficers' families.   &quot;They literally don't know where to put them,&quot; says MurrayFeshbach, a demographer at Washington's Georgetown Universitywho specializes in the Soviet Union. The housing crisis andgrowing ethnic problems, he says, are among the factors thatseem to be causing Soviet military planners to shift towardfavoring a much smaller, all-volunteer army. Ethnic turmoilamong the Armenians, Azerbaijanis and other nationalistgroups, Mr. Feshbach believes, will accelerate the shrinkingof the Soviet military because diverse groups will refuse toserve in the same units.   Mr. Feshbach, who recently returned from talks withofficials in Moscow and in the Baltic states, predicts themilitary that will emerge from the current upheaval will bepredominantly Russian. That would end a growing,destabilizing split between the current officer corps, whichis mostly Russian or Slavic, and enlisted troops, close to40% of whom now come from other ethnic groups.   The Rand report adds that Mr. Gorbachev has created a&quot;generational change&quot; in the upper ranks of the military,replacing most senior men with younger officers. The officercorps now breaks down into two factions, according to Rand:the &quot;far easterners,&quot; led by Soviet Defense Minister D.T.Yazov, men who spent many years serving together in Siberia,Central Asia and in the Pacific Fleet; and a tier of youngerofficers, slightly below them in rank, who served inAfghanistan. This second group, according to Rand, is &quot;likelyto play an important role for some time to come.&quot;   Some Rand analysts see the growing splits in the army asreflecting general ethnic strife that could grow worse in theyears ahead. &quot;You have most, if not all, the necessaryingredients present for a civil war,&quot; says Jeremy R. Azrael,a senior Rand Soviet specialist.   Such upheaval could affect U.S. security interests in anumber of ways, he says. For one thing, ethnic strife couldendanger the Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal, the majority ofwhich is in such outlying republics as Kazakhstan. Mr. Azraelsaid he believes the chances are one out of three that acivil war could break out in Russia within the next fiveyears.</TEXT></DOC>
