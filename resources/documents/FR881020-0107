It is the largest andhighest quality example of Great Valley Mixed Riparian Forest known tobe remaining in the South Pacific Border Natural Region. This heterogeneousforest is dominated by Fremont cottonwood and sycamore with an understoryof boxelder, Oregon ash, Hind's walnut, and tree willows. Extensive thickets,saplings, shrubs, and vines characterize the area offering roosting andbreeding habitats for several rare riparian-dependent faunal species, includingthe Valley elderberry longhorn beetle, the California yellow-billed cockoo,and the Swainson's hawk. A variety of other rare fauna inhabitat the area.The area varies from 0.8-1.2 miles wide and runs for 8 miles along theFeather River. This site is in multiple private and State ownership.<ITAG tagnum="84">Idaho</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Clearwater County</ITAG><T3>Aquarius Natural Area_</T3>This 3,900-acre site is located 40 milesnortheast of Orofino along the North Fork of the Clearwater River. Thissite, administered by the U.S. Forest Service, is the most diverse exampleof a type of cedar-hemlock forest known as montane coastal refugium. Itis restricted in its distribution to the Clearwater River Basin of northernIdaho. Deeply incised into the mountainous terrain, characteristic of theClearwater River Basin, the Aquarius Natural Area displays dramatic reliefaveraging 2,500 feet in a horizontal distance of less than one mile. Thesite lies along the border zone of the Idaho batholith, where quartz monzoniteintrudes Pre-Cambrian metamorphic rocks including gneiss, quartzite, andschists. Colluvial and alluvial fans occur in the canyon basin. Three planttaxa nearly endemic to the Clearwater Basin are known to occur within thesite including Case's corydalis, Constance's bittercress, and the Idahostrawberry.<ITAG tagnum="84">New Mexico</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Grant County</ITAG><T3>Gila River Sycamore Riparian Area</T3>_This 1,336-acre site extendsmore than 7 miles along the Gila River, 4.5 miles north-northwest of Gila.It is the best known example of Arizona Sycamore-Fremont poplar riparianwoodland remaining in the Southwestern United States. It supports ninelisted threatened and endangered species and harbors one of the richestknown bird habitats in New Mexico. At least six major plant associationsare represented. Flora includes Arizona sycamores, Fremont cottonwoods,netleaf hackberry, Arizona walnut, boxelder, Goodings willow, Arizona whiteoak and Emory oak_all with some old-growth specimens. This natural areais administered or owned by the U.S. Forest Service, The Nature Conservancyand several other private land owners.<ITAG tagnum="84">Oklahoma</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Greer County</ITAG><T3>Jester Cave_</T3>This 320-acre site contains the largest known gypsumcave in the United States, with 32,949 feet of surveyed passages. Mostcaves are dissolved in limestone, not gypsum. Approximately 200 gypsumcaves are known from western Oklahoma, southwestern Kansas, eastern NewMexico, and the Texas Panhandle. The site is in private ownership and grazingis the dominant land use.<ITAG tagnum="84">Oregon</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Jackson County</ITAG><T3>Round Top Butte_</T3>This 1,250-acre site is located 8 miles west ofButte Falls and 6 miles northeast of Eagle Point. The site, administeredby the Bureau of Land Management with other lands owned by several privateindividuals, contains the best reamining example of native valley uplandgrasslands in the valleys of southwestern Oregon and northwestern Californiain the North Pacific Border Natural Region; as well as the best remnantof Oregon white oak savanna and of ponderosa pine savanna. It is the onlysite with examples of all of the community types which occurred throughoutthe valleys of southern Oregon and northern California prior to Europeansettlement. The site provides a haven for wildlife and a variety of rareplants. The site is a nesting area for owls, hawks and the Lewis woodpecker(known only from seven sites and a candidate for listing under the EndangeredSpecies Act). Two additional plant species found here are listed as rare,threatened and endangered by the Oregon Heritage Data Base.<ITAG tagnum="81">Jefferson County</ITAG><T3>The Island_</T3>This 178-acre site is located 10 miles southeast ofMadras. The site is the largest and most pristine example of Western juniper/bigsagebrush/bluebunch wheatgrass community in the Columbia Plateau. It alsocontains the best example of the pumice Western juniper steppe community.This site is administered jointly by the Bureau of Land Management andthe U.S. Forest Service.<ITAG tagnum="81">Morrow County</ITAG><T3>Boardman Natural Area_</T3>This 6,656-acre site (consisting of threecontiguous parcels) is located 5 miles southeast of Boardman. It is thebest example of lowland grassland and shrubland in the Columbia PlateauNatural Region. This mosaic of shrublands and palouse grasslands is dominatedby one species of shrub_big sagebrush, and three species of grasses_needle-and-thread,bluebunch wheatgrass, and Sandberg bluegrass. The site is controlled bythe Bureau of Land Management under lease to the Department of the Navy.The Research Natural Area within the site is managed by The Nature Conservancy.<ITAG tagnum="84">Pennsylvania</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Lackawanna County</ITAG><T3>Nay Aug Park Gorge and Waterfall_</T3>This 35-acre site is locatedin the Northern Anthracite Basin of the Appalachian Ranges Natural Region,within the city of Scranton. The site is an excellent example of a waterfalland gorge resulting from erosion of differentially resistant rocks. Theseprominent geological features were created by Roaring Brook, a tributaryof the Lackawanna River. The entire park exhibits several geological themesvividly illustrating active landscape-forming processes. The sedimentaryrocks existing at this site demonstrate sedimentary processes, environments,and epochs of earth history. The waterfall is an excellent example of afluvial nickpoint due to glaciation during the Illinoian and Wisconsinanglacial stages. This natural area is considered among the best availablewithin the natural region for public interpretation of earth history. Thesite is owned and managed by the city of Scranton.<ITAG tagnum="84">Texas</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Kenedy, Kleberg, andamp; Willacy Counties</ITAG><T3>Big Shell/Little Shell Beaches_</T3>This 2,200-acre site is locatedwithin Padre Island National Seashore, southeast of Corpus Christi. Itcontains the only extensive shell beaches on the predominantly terrigenousbarrier islands of the Gulf Coastal Plain Natural Region. The shell beachesare an excellent example of shoreline deposition in a zone of convergingsurface currents and littoral drifting of sediment. These beaches are alsoamong the least disturbed in the region. This site is administered by theNational Park Service.<ITAG tagnum="81">Kenedy and Kleberg Counties</ITAG><T3>Upper Laguna Madre_</T3>This 237,253-acre site is also located withinPadre Island National Seashore.
