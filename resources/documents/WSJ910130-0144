The new mandate would allow the EC executive commission tonegotiate bilaterally with the U.S. and multilaterally withother aircraft makers, including those in Japan, Canada andthe European Free Trade Association countries, EC officialssaid. The foreign ministers will decide on the mandate duringa two-day meeting to begin Monday.</LP><TEXT>   The mandate would in effect allow the commission to offerto eliminate production subsidies and put a ceiling of 45% ondevelopment subsidies for planes of more than 100 seats. TheU.S. has called for subsidies to be capped at 35%. In return,the EC wants more discipline and disclosure on government andresearch contracts granted to U.S. makers, such as Boeing Co.and McDonnell Douglas Corp. The EC considers such contractsindirect subsidies.   The U.S. and any other partners to an accord would have toagree not to table a complaint to the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade, an EC official said.   The U.S. hasn't commented officially, because the mandatehasn't been approved. But a representative said the U.S.maintains the right to table a complaint in the GATT until anagreement is signed. The U.S. favors a multilateral agreementas long as it doesn't hold up an outcome to the currentEC-U.S. dispute, a U.S. spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
