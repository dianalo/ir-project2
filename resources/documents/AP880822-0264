The Dow Jones Average of 30 Industrials, which fell 11.03 onFriday and 21.52 for the week, was off 0.35 at 2,015.65 at noontime.

Big Board volume came to 61.64 million shares as of noon on WallStreet, up from 49.59 million shares traded at the same point inthe previous session.   Trading volume has been sluggish in recent days as investorshave shunned the market while trying to figure out where theeconomy is headed and what the prospects are for inflation andinterest rates.   The economic indicators have been generally strong, adevelopment which might normally support stock prices.   But the pace of economic growth has raised concerns about aresurgence of inflation and speculation that the Federal Reservemay take new steps to choke off a price rise by pushing interestrates higher.   Higher rates would make the yields available on bonds moreattractive.   Later this week, the government plans to report on consumerprices in July and second-quarter economic growth.   Stock prices opened higher, but quickly changed direction asbond prices slipped. Yields on the closely-watched 30-year Treasurybond edged up past the 9.40 percent mark after finishing below thatlevel last week.   Charles Jensen, a technical analyst for MKI Securities Corp.,said today's decline in stock prices was ``a continuation of apattern of weakness in the bond market.''   ``We have a heavy calendar of new (Treasury) issues this weekand some serious economic figures that everyone is worried about.You have a lot of people flocking to the sidelines pending someimprovement,'' Jensen said.
