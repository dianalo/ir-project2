The December contract rose 1.30 cents a pound to 80.25 cents. This was down from a session high of 81.35, as an element of wariness tended to damp the rally.    &quot;There's an uncertainty caused by the stock market that's chilling buying interest in futures,&quot; said one analyst who observed that the market was unable to make up losses of as much as 2.65 cents on Monday. Nevertheless, copper generated enough strength to overcome the negative sentiment and end up on the plus side.    Declines in stocks of copper in warehouses of the Commodity Exchange are accelerating, emphasizing the tightness of supplies, analysts said. Yesterday, the inventories fell 2,887 tons to 70,646 tons. They were as low as 62,000 tons in July, according to an exchange spokesman. But the speed with which they are dropping now is having an impact on the market, analysts and trade sources said.    &quot;There is continued Japanese interest for Commodity Exchange warehouse copper supplies in El Paso and Amarillo,&quot; said Robert Wylde, president of R.J. Wylde Metals Inc., a New York-based metals broker and dealer.    As a result of continued demand for copper and reduction of supplies, the December contract on the Commodity Exchange increased its premium over the March contract by a half cent a pound to 2.80 cents. Under normal conditions, prices for nearby-delivery copper tend to range lower than more distant months whose prices include carrying charges and other costs.    &quot;Premiums for nearby-delivery copper in the cash market are high throughout the U.S., especially in the Northeast,&quot; said Mr. Wylde. Dealers are asking for an extra five cents a pound, up from four cents recently and two cents in August, he said.    In individual commodity markets yesterday:    PRECIOUS METALS: Silver and platinum futures prices tumbled for the second straight day amid continued concerns that stock-market volatility will lead to economic retrenchment, analysts and traders said. &quot;Any slowdown will reduce demand for platinum and silver because of their industrial use,&quot; said Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader for Chase Manhattan Bank in New York. The large liquidation of contracts reflects the reticence of some traders to hold large speculative positions in light of the recent sharp stock-market fluctuations. On the Commodity Exchange, silver contracts for December delivery fell 7.5 cents, to $7.405 an ounce. Platinum prices for current delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange slipped $15, to $551.80 an ounce. Some traders continue to flock to gold as a safe haven for their funds amid the economic uncertainty. October gold prices on the Comex fell just 50 cents an ounce, to $475.70.    ENERGY: Oil-futures prices rose, paced by higher petroleum-product prices. Gasoline futures posted the strongest advance as the November contract at the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped 0.91 cent a gallon, to 54.57 cents. The rebound in the stock market also lent some support, some analysts said. Daily fluctuations in stock prices &quot;continue to be part of the near-term psychology&quot; of the oil market, as well as other industrial commodities, said one New York trader. Trading was light, however, amid widespread hesitancy to initiate large positions in the futures market, some brokers said. Crude-oil contracts for December delivery at the New York Merc rose 13 cents, to $20.12 a barrel. November heating-oil prices rose 0.47 cent, to 57.36 cents a gallon.    SUGAR: Futures prices declined as traders ignored what was termed &quot;a moderately supportive&quot; estimate of the global sugar crop this season. The March contract, after edging slightly higher, fell to settle at 7.51 cents a pound, for a loss of 0.12 cent. F.O. Licht, the West German sugar statistical firm, estimated that world production of sugar in the current season that began Sept. 1, would fall 1.92 million metric tons below consumption of 105.4 million tons. A metric ton is equal to 2,204.62 pounds. This was a greater drop than expected, but speculators &quot;aren't reacting as quickly as usual, in the wake of the stock-market crash,&quot; one analyst said, so the report appeared to have little impact on the market. The Licht report said world sugar stocks would decline by the end of this season to 32.86% of annual consumption, down from 35.67% at the end of the past season. Stocks at around 25% to 30% are regarded as normal. The reduction in the past two seasons has been considerable, dropping from 37.8% at the end of the 1985-86 season, an analyst said.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Most grain and soybean futures prices finished higher. Strong European demand for soybean meal lifted those contracts. The meal market also got a boost from continued speculation about Soviet interest and purchases, analysts said. A lack of farmer selling buoyed corn prices, which also received support from Friday's 13-state cattle-on-feed report. The Agriculture Department's quarterly report, which found a 10% increase in the number of animals on feedlots as of Oct. 1, signals continued domestic demand for the grain. Wheat finished mixed, while bean prices were higher. </TEXT></DOC>
