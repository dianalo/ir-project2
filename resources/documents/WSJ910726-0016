But in an an unusual order, Federal Judge Harold Greenewarned that the decision could have an anti-competitiveeffect. And Judge Greene, who oversees the 1982 consentdecree that broke up the Bell system, stayed the orderpending a review by an appeals court here. The 71-pageopinion -- a forceful argument against lifting the ban --nevertheless noted that an appeals court decision last springleft no other choice.</LP><TEXT>   If the Bells do enter the information services industry,it would reshape the market, but Judge Greene warned that inhis view the changes wouldn't be for the better. &quot;The mostprobable consequences . . . will be the elimination ofcompetition from that market and the concentration of thesources of information of the American people in just a fewdominant, collaborative conglomerates, with the captive localtelephone monopolies as their base,&quot; he wrote.   Judge Greene said the stay was necessary so that theregional companies and others didn't make business decisionsbased on a ruling that later could be scrapped. Yesterday'sactions set in motion what is likely to be a lengthy reviewof the case that could end up at the Supreme Court.   Despite the stay, the seven Bell companies were ecstatic.&quot;This decision finally will open the door to the informationage for many Americans,&quot; said Edward Whitacre, chairman andchief executive officer of Southwestern Bell Corp., St.Louis. &quot;Consumers and small businesses are the real winnerstoday.&quot;   Ronald Stowe, who heads Pacific Telesis Group's Washingtonoffice, said the San Francisco company was &quot;very pleased&quot;with the decision. But he contended that the stay &quot;may delayour companies from bringing new services to market.&quot; PacificTelesis and other Bell companies are considering asking JudgeGreene or the appeals court to vacate the stay.   Since the Bell breakup in 1984, the Bell companies havebeen aggressively pursuing entry into information servicesdespite the opposition of publishers and other informationproviders.   The current case stems from Judge Greene's 1987 review ofthe consent decree, in which he upheld bans on the Baby Bellsentering into information services, manufacturing andlong-distance services. That decision was appealed, and inApril 1990 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuitupheld Judge Greene's decision to maintain restrictions onlong distance and manufacturing but ordered him to reconsiderthe third ban.   Major newspaper publishers for years have lobbied heavilyagainst allowing the Bells to become information providers,fearing that they could steal advertising revenue, especiallyclassified ad revenue. As owners of the phone lines, thepublishers say, the phone companies would have a lock on boththe information and the ability to distribute itelectronically.   While some newspapers have been striking partnerships withthe phone companies and setting up their own services, othersstill object to the entry of the phone companies.   &quot;We regret that Judge Greene felt obliged to rule againstfair competition and the rights of consumers,&quot; said CathleenBlack, president of the American Newspaper PublishersAssociation. &quot;Those two principles are worth fighting for,and we have every intention of continuing the public policydebate on this issue.&quot;   Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal anda provider of information over phone lines, had no comment. Aspokesman said Dow Jones wouldn't comment until it had timeto study the judge's decision.   William Dean Singleton, owner of the Denver Post andHouston Post, said several of his papers are in the planningstages with regional Bells on establishing services where thenewspaper provides editorial matter and sells audio ads.   &quot;At first, there was a feeling we could beat the Bells tothe punch, but now it's more a case of being partners,&quot; saidMr. Singleton, vice chairman of Houston's MediaNews GroupInc., publisher of 72 daily and non-daily newspapers. Many ofMr. Singleton's papers are already using the telephone as aninformation and revenue source in some cities, with the helpof phone companies.   Although the decision wouldn't allow the phone companiesto provide cable television service, it is considered certainto spur the Baby Bells to lobby harder for an end to the banon phone companies operating cable systems within their ownservice territories.   Alfred Sikes, chairman of the Federal CommunicationsCommission, which ultimately would oversee the Bellinformation service offerings, said he was gratified with theorder. He said the agency would provide safeguards to preventanti-competitive behavior. The FCC &quot;will continue to providefull and effective public interest safeguards in thisimportant and sensitive field,&quot; he said.   Nevertheless, Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of theConsumer Federation of America offered a stark assessment:&quot;This will lead to the creation of a new Bell monopoly withinflated local telephone rates and a return to the era of oneantitrust lawsuit filed after another.&quot;   Analysts suggested the effects won't be immediatelyapparent. &quot;Short-term, my reaction to this is, `So what?'&quot;said Robert B. Morris III, telecommunications analyst atGoldman Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;But the benefits will be evolutionary,offering the phone companies a way to differentiate theirservice from competitors, enhance utilization of theirnetworks and capture some value-added profits.&quot;   For example, said Mr. Morris, the phone company, insteadof just transmitting data from an automatic teller machine toa bank's database, could hold a bank's account information inits own database. That would cut overall transmission costsand add revenue for providing an extra service to the bank.   Jack B. Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said thedecision &quot;will accelerate the installation of advancedsignaling networks and fiber optics to the home,&quot; benefitingcustomers and network equipment suppliers as well. But hecautioned there could be some negative earnings impact on theBells, as &quot;they'll be spending money to offer these newinformation services, {and} they'll have to allow theircompetitors access to these advanced networks, which are themost proprietary thing the Bell companies own.&quot;   Judge Greene's decision is likely to change the dynamicsof legislation to lift the consent-decree ban on the Bells'ability to manufacture telecommunications equipment. A billalready has passed the Senate that eases the manufacturingban. Now, the pressure will mount on Rep. Edward Markey (D.,Mass.), chairman of the House telecommunications panel, tomove legislation that would include stringent limits on theBaby Bells' behavior not only in manufacturing but also ininformation services.   As for the Baby Bells' former parent, American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. remains neutral, a spokesman said. ATandamp;T hasn'topposed lifting the information services restriction, but ithas fought any efforts by the Bells to lift the other tworestrictions -- manufacturing phone equipment and providinglong-distance service.   ---   Patrick M.
