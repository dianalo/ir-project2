Germany has suitable experience in coalconversion technologies for both fixed-bed gasification and fluidized-bedcombustion. The purpose of this study was to work out concepts for theadaptation of these proven coal conversion technologies to handle Brazil'shigh ash content coals. The integration of coal conversion plant andpower plant is feasible but the viability depends heavily on specificconsiderations, the sales price for electrical energy, and on economicforecasts. Technical and economical aspects of a hybrid gasificationplant consisting of both fixed-bed and fluidized-bed systems were considered,which aims for an increase of the coal fraction to be utilized in thegasification section. The results of the investigations showed the advantageof a hybrid plant compared to a plant only using the fixed-bed gasificationsystem. In case of the hybrid system, both conceptions, the coal conversionplant with integrated power plant and the coal conversion plant withsteam boiler and import of electric energy, result in lower specificproduct cost.</TEXT></DOC>
