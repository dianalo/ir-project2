Shultz mettoday with President Amil Gemayel of Lebanon in an effort to seal aSyrian-arranged deal for a new Lebanese constitution to endLebanon's 12-year-old civil war.   Shultz, who is headed home from a futile effort in the MiddleEast to try to set up Arab-Israeli peace talks, met with Gemayel atLarnaca Airport for 90 minutes. The Cyprus stop wasn't announced inadvance.   After the meeting, Shultz announced that April Glasbie, head ofthe Lebanon desk in the U.S. State Department, will go to Beirut tocontinue the American mediation. Ms. Glasbie is now in Damascusholding talks with Syrian leaders.   Shultz said his talk with Gemayel was ``productive,'' but hegave no details. After the meeting, Gemayel returned to Lebanon inthe army helicopter which brought him on the 100-mile flight toCyprus. He made no statement.   Shultz told reporters before leaving Amman, Jordan, thatstability in Lebanon would be ``a great advantage in our effortsagainst terrorism'' in seeking the release of nine Americans heldhostage in Lebanon.   He said a new division of power among the competing factionswould help all countries in the area, including Israel, and Syriaitself.   ``We want to see an election go off successfully'' in Lebanon,Shultz said, referring to presidential balloting which must be heldby September, when Gemayel's term expires.   Gemayel, a Maronite Christian, has sought for nearly six yearsto gain control of his country. But Syria, Lebanon's more powerfulneighbor to the east, plays a dominant role in Lebanese politics.   A new distribution of political power in Lebanon could reduceSyria's military presence there, which is becoming an economicdrain on Damascus.   Whether it would help American and other hostages is not clear,although a senior U.S. official said Thursday that Shultz alsotalked to Syrian President Hafez Assad about their plight.   Many of the 22 foreign hostages are believed held by anIranian-influenced group, possibly beyond the reach of Syrianpower, although Syria has close ties with Iran. The longest-heldhostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   An administration source said Thursday in Santa Barbara, Calif.,where President Reagan is vacationing, that Reagan sent a letter toGemayel expressing concern about the continuing conflict in Lebanon.   The official said he had not seen the letter, but ``I wouldcharacterize it as underscoring the mutual interests that theUnited States and Lebanon have in building peace in the region.''   In Washington, a State Department official said the UnitedStates was ``serving as a postman between Assad and Gemayel,'' whohave not spoken to each other in over a year.   The two U.S. officials spoke on the condition of anonymity.   The aim of a new Lebanese constitution would be to modify the``national pact'' devised in 1943 that allocated the top positionsin the government to specific religious groups.   The president is a Christian, the premier is a Sunni Moslem andthe speaker of Parliament is a Shiite Moslem. In the ensuing 45years, Moslems overtook Christians as a majority and demanded alarger role.   If the diplomatic effort succeeds, it will mark a turnabout inShultz's fortunes in Lebanon.   Five years ago, he thought he had worked out an agreementbetween Lebanon and Israel for the two to cooperate economically,politically and diplomatically. Syria undercut the accord and itfell apart.   In the meantime, Syria increased its power in Lebanon.   In southern Lebanon, near the Israeli border, the situation isespecially unstable. Palestinians fought with the Shiite Amalmovement while Hezbollah, an Iranian-linked group, was suspected ofkidnappings and hijackings.   Israel, which drove to Beirut in a 1982 invasion, is arming theChristian-led South Lebanese Army militia and occupies a strip ofland north of its border.   Reagan accused Syria in 1986 of promoting terrorism. He orderedU.S. Ambassador William Eagleton to withdraw, barred high-levelmeetings with Syrian officials, stopped sales of high technologyand imposed other sanctions.   Last September, Eagleton was sent back to Damascus and most ofthe sanctions quietly disappeared. Shultz stopped in Damascus twicelast month and returned again Tuesday.   Assad is an outspoken supporter of the PLO's having a separateseat at proposed Middle East peace talks. Shultz's plan wouldexclude the Palestine Liberation Organization and seat Palestiniansas part of a Jordanian delegation.   Assad also demands Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, asecurity belt Syria lost in the 1967 Six-Day War that now serves asa buffer to protect northern Israeli villages from a resumption ofbombardment from across the border.</TEXT></DOC>
