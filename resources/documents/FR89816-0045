The assessment provides a basis for the conclusionthat the field testing of these genetically engineered tobacco plants willnot present a risk of introduction or dissemination of a plant pest andwill not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.Based upon this finding of no significant impact, the Animal and PlantHealth Inspection Service has determined that an environmental impact statementneed not be prepared.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Copies of the environmental assessment of no significantimpact are available for public inspection at Biotechnology, Biologics,and Environmental Protection, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service,U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 841, Federal Building, 6505 BelcrestRoad, Hyattsville, MD 20782.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Dr. Sivramiah Shantharam, Biotechnologist,Biotechnology Permit Unit, Biotechnology, Biologics, and EnvironmentalProtection, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Departmentof Agriculture, Room 841, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville,MD 20782, (301) 436-6774.

A permit must be obtained before a regulatedarticle can be introduced in the United States. The regulations set forthprocedures for obtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstatemovement of a regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the releaseinto the environment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmentalassessment and, when necessary, an environmental impact statement beforeissuing a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article(see 52 FR 22906).BioTechnica Agriculture, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, has submittedan application for a permit for release into the environment to field testgenetically engineered tobacco plants modified to express a dihydropicolinicacid synthase gene (DHDPS), which provides increased nutrient value tothe plant. The field trial is to take place in Dane County, Wisconsin.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the tobacco plants under the conditionsdescribed in the BioTechnica Agriculture, Inc., application. APHIS concludedthat the field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introductionor dissemination and will not have any significant impact on the qualityof the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by BioTechnica Agriculture, Inc. as well asa review of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentationof APHIS's review and analysis of the environmental impacts associatedwith conducting the field testing.The facts supporting APHIS's finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A DHDPS gene from <T3>E. Coli</T3> has been inserted into a tobacco chromosome. In this fieldtrial none of the introduced genes can spread to any other plant, becausethe test plants will not be allowed to flower. In nature, the genetic materialcontained in a chromosome can only be transferred to another sexually compatibleplant by cross-pollination and fertilization.2. Neither the DHDPS gene nor its gene product, confers on tobacco anyplant pest characteristics.3. The DHDPS gene does not provide the transformed tobacco plants withany measurable selective advantage over nontransformed tobacco plants intheir ability to be disseminated or to become established in the environment.4. The vector used to transfer the DHDPS gene to tobacco plants has beenevaluated for its use in this specific experiment, and does not pose aplant pest risk. The vector, although derived from a DNA sequence withknown plant pathogenic potential, has been disarmed; that is, the genesthat are necessary for pathogenicity have been removed. The vector alsohas been tested and shown to be not pathogenic to a susceptible plant.5. The vector agent, the phytopathogenic bacterium that was used to deliverthe vector DNA carrying the DHDPS gene into tobacco plant cells, was eliminatedand is no longer associated with the transformed tobacco plants. 6. Horizontal movement of genetic material after insertion into the plantgenome (i.e., into chromosomal DNA) has not been demonstrated. After deliveringand inserting the DNA to be transferred into the tobacco genome, the vectordoes not survive in or on the transformed plant. No mechanism is knownto exist in nature to move an inserted gene horizontally from a chromosomeof a transformed plant to any other organism.7. The field test plot will be 9,000 square feet in size, and the testplants will be located approximately 1 mile from any other tobacco plants.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274,August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC, this 11th day of August 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
