You demand a degree of conformity that couldn't exist in any free university.    Glenn Campbell, director of the Hoover Institution and chairman of the board of the Reagan Presidential Foundation, has assured the world that &quot;Stanford can boast a Reagan connection&quot; and, in effect, that Stanford has been a Reagan think tank. Now the Journal says that Stanford is a hotbed of anti-Reagan intolerance. How do you square that?    The Stanford trustees said they would like to have the Reagan archives as an academic resource, but not a museum and not a public-policy center unless under the control of Stanford's normal academic governance. Recently the leaders of the faculty senate reaffirmed that they would like the library on the edge of the campus, but that if a large facility with displays and conference rooms was intended, they would prefer that it be located farther away from the center of campus. (They also disavowed Mr. Campbell's statements that suggested this was a partisan institution.)    Frankly, there was growing concern that a national Reagan shrine would become a major tourist attraction that would exacerbate our already serious traffic problem. It is not evidence of intolerance on the part of professors to be concerned about their ability to drive to and park near work.    As for the statements of a student and Prof. Manley in Stanford's student paper, the Daily, they are normal in the robust give and take of our democracy. I have read more intolerant statements on your editorial page. Other students and faculty writing in the Daily expressed regret at the foundation's decision to move elsewhere. It isn't fair for you to pick two statements out of context and to tar the whole faculty with the charge of intolerance.    Our alumni and parents (I am both) appreciate and respect the diversity of views on the Stanford faculty. Those who are conservatives can accept Glenn Campbell's assurance that their point of view is well represented on our faculty.    The fact that many of us have been able to return to Stanford after service in administrations of both parties, and to work together in an atmosphere of civility and friendly collegiality, gives the lie to your charge of intolerance.    Prof. Alain Enthoven   Stanford University   Graduate School of Business   Stanford, Calif.   ---   Your editorial struck a responsive chord with me. My daughter is now a freshman at a big name school. I did not worry much about the school's politics when we applied. First, she applied in pre-med, which has low political content (she has now switched to international relations). Second, I didn't realize how bad it was. Third, I didn't know how to find out about the school's politics anyway.    With hindsight, I have some advice for conservative-minded parents of students who will be in the class of '92, or later. Subscribe to the student papers from the colleges you are interested in during your child's senior year of high school. See how many conservative speakers are invited to campus vs. how many liberal ones. See what kind of teach-ins the professors organize on campus. This is not a perfect way to assess the situation at a college, but it's a lot better than nothing.    A.J. Bowen   Kingston, N.Y.   ---   After reading your editorial, I got out my trusty Rand McNally and attempted to locate Cummings, Ga. I was unable to do so.    Since the national media have continued to lambaste the Forsyth County community of Cumming, Ga., for three months, please spell it correctly when you throw your next harpoon.    Jack C.
