 Whatgood are fast answers if we then have to slowly (and inaccurately) copy theonscreen results by hand?andM;In the beginning, printers were fairly simple beasts: Send a single signal,get a single letter or number on the paper.andP;  You didn't have any choice aboutthe kind of letter or spacing, or anything except when to tell the printer tostart a new line (which also took a single signal).andM;Then we started to get fancy.andP;  Epson dot matrix printers, for example,started to offer bold, and underline, superscript, expanded, and compressedletters.andP;  Thus, we needed a more complex set of signals to tell the printerwhat we wanted it to do.andP;  Such commands usually start with the ASCII EscapeCharacter (decimal 27), which is why printer command languages are oftenreferred to as &quot;escape sequences.&quot;andM;Printer commands took a quantum leap in complexity when Hewlett-Packardintroduced the original LaserJet.andP;  Instead of commands that were two or fourcharacters long, we were confronted by 20- or 30-character-long escapesequences.andP;  The verbose structure was needed to specify choices such astypeface, proportional or monospace spacing, line spacing, font size andweight, upright or italic, symbol-set selection, and much, much more.andP;  HPcalled this set of commands the HP Printer Command Language, or PCL.andM;PCL has been expanded to take on additional capabilities as the laser printermarket has matured, and HP's newer designs offer new features.andP;  Many usersare familiar with the LaserJet Series II printer's capabilities, and it canhandle most of the PCL Level 4 commands.andP;  This includes the ability todownload fonts from disk, load macros, and create images using certaingraphics primitives for line drawing and patterned shading.andM;The LaserJet IIIP is one of the latest generation of HP laser printers, andshares a new version of HP's printer language with the III, IIID, and IIIsiprinters.andP;  This new version is called PCL5, and while these printers can doeverything that the Series II can do, they can also do more.andM;One of the most visible and attractive features of PCL5 is its support ofscalable fonts.andP;  Until now, LaserJets could only handle bitmapped fonts.andP;  A10-point font had to be stored separately from a 12-point font, taking upextra space in the printer's controller, cartridge, or on your hard disk.andO;Scalable fonts let you pick the size type you want, and the printer generatesthe letters it needs based on font outlines.andP;  This used to be PostScript'sclaim to fame, but now you get similar capabilities with PCL5 printers.andM;PostScript printers also let you print text in different directions on thesame page.andP;  PCL Level 4 printers, like the Series II, only offered portraitand landscape orientations, and couldn't print both on the same page at onetime.andP;  PCL5 has removed that limitation.andP;  The printer can automaticallyrotate any bitmapped or scalable font in any of four directions (two portraitand two landscape), and print them all on the same page.andP;  It can also takeany scalable font outline and print it at any angle on the page.andM;The trick with putting scalable fonts at an angle is made possible by anotherfeature in PCL5.andP;  In addition to accepting the commands in PCL Level 4, PCL5also includes the HPGL/2 plotting language used in many plotters.andP;  Not onlydoes this make it possible to print many business graphs much faster, but itis also possible to convert scalable fonts into HPGL/2 images that can thenbe manipulated with additional commands.andP;  Not only can you print theseletters at any angle, but you can also perform all sorts of graphic tricks,such as filling the letters with patterns.andM;PCL5 printers can also be faster at printing bitmapped graphics than PCLLevel 4 printers with the same print engine because the printer's controllercan accept compressed data instead of the full bit image.andP;  The data takesless time to be transferred between the computer and the printer, resultingin a faster print time.andM;There are other differences between PCL Level 4 and PCL5, but they are lessobvious and more esoteric.andP;  For example, font cartridges can now containmacros as well as fonts.andP;  PCL5 printers also support compressed soft fonts.andM;There is one important point to make about PCL5: It does not include theResolution Enhancement Technology that is also a part of the LaserJet III,IIID, IIIsi, and the IIIP.andP;  This feature improves the print quality of theseprinters' output, but it is a function of the printer controller itself, notthe command language used.andP;  As a result, remember to keep PCL5 support andResolution Enhancement Technology features separate when considering newproducts that claim PCL5 compatibility.andM;PCL5 does offer many new and exciting performance features.andP;  It providesPostScript capabilities that many people want, and at a cost far lower thanPostScript printers.andP;  It may take a while before software applications havedrivers that can take full advantage of PCL5's features, such as fancy fonteffects through conversion to HPGL/2, but most programs already make broaduse of the language's power.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
