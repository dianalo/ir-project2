We can slow down the military rhythmat times to concentrate on organization and political work. So whenthe crucial moment arrives, we're ready.''   At the age of 30, Luis is a 10-year veteran of the civil war.   The armed forces and the U.S. government, which foots the bills,say professionalization and tactical reform of El Salvador'smilitary _ combined with the ``strategic bankruptcy'' of theinsurgent army _ have provided a light at the end of the longtunnel of civil war.   The conflict has killed an estimated 70,000 people, most of themcivilians. The leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,or FMLN, says it is fighting to do away with what it calls an``oligarchic'' system that has enriched a few while leaving thevast majority of Salvadorans destitute.   The rebels also say they want to end what they consider U.S.domination of their country.   El Salvador's military command and U.S. Embassy point out thatFMLN forces have not scored a resounding military success, such asthe overrunning of a brigade, in two years.   Even so, combat continues daily in the countryside. The rebelshave also struck in the capital and they have acquired new weaponsto counter the government's air power _ its single biggest tacticaladvantage.   By the government's count, its forces suffered a 40 percentincrease in casualties in the 12 months ending May 31, comparedwith the previous year. Casualties inflicted on rebel forces wereup 47 percent, according to the Defense Ministry in San Salvador.   The government has 56,000 men in three military branches and themilitarized police forces. It has 72 helicopters and 63 fixed-wingaircraft _ A-37 fighter-bombers and O-2 reconnaissance planes. Themilitary receives $85 million annually from the United States.   The FMLN has about 7,000 combatants, down from 12,000 early inthe decade but stable since about 1986, according to U.S. andSalvadoran figures. It relies heavily on ``popular armament'' _mines, mortars, bombs and grenades devised of homemade explosives,scrap metal, nails, tape, twine and burlap.   The rebels reportedly get some arms from Nicaragua and Cuba andreceive some money from Communist governments in Eastern Europe.They also receive money from so-called ``solidarity groups'' in theUnited States and Western Europe.   Despite the disparity in forces and resources, the army has beenunable to defeat the rebels or erode their base of logisticalsupport in up to a third of the country _ although the rebels havealso been unable to expand.   ``Everybody except the army knows where we are,'' chuckled Luis,welcoming two foreign journalists who hiked up this mountain 60miles east of San Salvador, pausing to ask peasants the whereaboutsof ``the boys,'' as the rebels are known in the countryside.   Five mid-level commanders of the Southeastern Front were onCerro del Tigre (Tiger Mountain) for a two-day session on strategy,achievements and shortcomings.   The first night saw rebel forces harass army positions in SantaElena, south of the mountain. The second night they attackedgovernment troops in Jucuapa, north of the heights.   If the military's big edge is air support, the guerrilla army'sadvantage appears to be in the morale and motiviation of itsfighters.   The overwhelming majority of government footsoldiers areadolescent peasants who were drafted into service, although thearmy has several elite battalions of seasoned troopers.   Four U.S. Army colonels, in a report last year on the Salvadoranconflict, quoted a senior U.S. officer in El Salvador as saying ofgovernment forces, ``When the platoon leader ain't there, you ain'tgot a platoon.''   ``El Salvador reveals an enemy whose commitment to victory isabsolute and unbending,'' the report said. It characterized theFMLN as ``tough, competent, highly motivated'' and added that itmight be able to ``sustain its current strategy indefinitely.''   During a recent weekend off from work, an Salvadoran air forcehelicopter pilot told how twice in recent months his craft had beenseriously damaged by rebel ground fire. U.S. advisers and localofficers blame Soviet-designed Dragunov sniper rifles smuggled into FMLN forces over the past eight months.   The weapons have an effective range of 800 yards _ more thantwice that of assault weapons such as the Soviet-designed AK-47 andthe U.S. M-16. The Dragunov has obliged pilots to fly higher, takemore hits, bomb less accurately and abandon more missions.   With air power less effective, the rebels have resumed _ after alayoff of more than three years _ regular daytime attacks.   ``We are not going to win the war by killing guerrillas,'' Col.Rene Ponce, who heads El Salvador's joint chiefs of staff, said ina recent interview.   He and other top officers have been pursuing a ``hearts andminds'' campaign with permanent military presence in zones untilnow freely roamed by rebels and ``civic action'' programs of foodand medicine distribution.   The approach appears to have had some success in the northeast.But in other regions it is not uncommon to hear peasants refer topatrolling government soldiers as ``the enemy.''   Gen. Humberto Larios, the defense minister, recently toldforeign reporters the army killed more than 1,000 guerrillas lastyear. He said the rebels are taking heavier losses this year and ifthis pace can be sustained, they'll loose closer to 2,000 in 1989.   Thousands more are being wounded or are deserting rebel ranks,he said.   But he declined to predict when any all-out victory would come.   ``You can't apply a formula to say when this war will end,'' hesaid.   Both the rebels and the new government of President AlfredoCristiani, a rightist, say they want to negotiate. But they can'tagree on who should talk, how to talk and what precisely to talkabout.   ``We do what is necessary to keep the army tied down,'' saidLuis, surrounded by about 30 rebel fighters relaxing, napping,playing cards or cleaning their weapons.   ``Meanwhile, we create favorable conditions for the moment oftruth. If there are no negotiations, we'll eventually win. It'sjust a question of how high the human and material cost will be.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 6</NOTE></DOC>
