Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., who negotiated with GE officials,said the arrangement was ``breaking new ground,'' because it wouldmean ``real reductions in the volume of CFC's (chlorofluorocarbons)now being released into our air.''   Jim Allen, a spokesman for GE's appliance division inLouisville, Ky., said he expected the offset would take place nextyear after completion of the program to replace compressors innearly a million large-size refrigerators sold in 1987-88.   GE is replacing the compressors, which drive the coolant system,in customers' homes. But during that process, about five ounces offreon are released. The freon joins other CFC's in floating towardsthe stratosphere, where the chemicals can destroy the paper-thinozone layer.   While ozone is the chief ingredient of smog when close to theground, it protects against ultraviolet radiation at higher levels.If a hole in the ozone layer develops and increased radiation comesthrough, it could cause more cases of skin cancer and eyecataracts, depressed human immune systems and reduced crop yields,according to scientists and the Environmental Protection Agency.   CFC's also have been implicated in global warming, in which theearth's heat is trapped, causing temperature increases, droughts,heat waves and a rise in sea levels.   Gore has introduced legislation to reduce and eventually banozone-depleting chemicals, which already are headed for a 50percent worldwide reduction by the end of the century under aninternational agreement.   Allen, the GE spokesman, said the company hasn't decided exactlyhow to offset the releases caused by repairs, but added that thefirm has pledged to ``take off the marketplace the amount we use inthe (replacement) program.''   He said the company initiated the replacement programvoluntarily in January after testing showed that certaincompressors would not last the required 10 years.   Gore and an official of an environmental research group told anews conference that GE could have done more by using specialequipment to recapture the freon during repairs instead ofreleasing it into the atmosphere.   ``We are deeply disappointed by the company's refusal to stoproutine releases of CFC's,'' William Walsh, of the U.S. PublicInterest Group, said in a letter to GE. Walsh also was involved inthe negotiations.   Allen said portable machines that could recapture the freon onthe spot are not widely available and are unable to recycle the gasduring the repair process.   The negotiations with GE began after Lynda Draper of EllicottCity, Md., complained when the freon was released in her kitchen.   ``I was totally outraged,'' she said. Draper said she contactedthe public interest group after calls to GE brought no satisfactoryresponse. The public interest organization then contacted Gore.</TEXT></DOC>
