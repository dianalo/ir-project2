The trial follows a police investigation into thecapsizing of the ferry Herald of Free Enterprise as it leftthe Belgian port of Zeebrugge March 6, 1987. The company,three officials and four crew members are accused ofunlawfully killing just one passenger, Alison Joy Gaillard,27, selected to represent those who died.   The seven men and the company pleaded not guilty to thecharges.   Manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of lifeimprisonment; the company faces an unlimited fine if foundguilty. The trial could last up to five months.                                                                                                          PORTUGUESE AIR FARES UP                                                                                                          The Portuguese government increased domestic air fares bysome 10% yesterday, citing rising oil prices. A one-wayeconomy fare between Lisbon and the southern resort of Farorose 9.5%, to 10,400 escudos (about $75). Economy ratesbetween the capital and the northern city of Oporto rose bythe same margin to 11,500 escudos. Air fares between mainlandPortugal and the Atlantic islands of Madeira and the Azoreswere unchanged.                                                                                                          INDONESIAN PETROCHEMICALS                                                                                                          A new Indonesian company, PT Chandra Asri, signed anagreement to invest $2.4 billion in a complex to produceolefins, which are petrochemical byproducts used in makingplastics. The signing increases doubts that a previouslyproposed $1.7 billion olefins project involving RoyalDutch/Shell Group and Indonesia's Bimantara Citra Group willgo ahead. Shell and its Indonesian partners haven't been ableto agree on shareholding arrangements. Analysts said that ifthe Shell-Bimantara deal falls through, either Bimantara orits chairman, Bambang Trihatmodjo, a son of PresidentSuharto, could play an equity or other role in the ChandraAsri development.

In the future, the two-story, 180-seatrestaurant expects to serve about 285 pizzas daily, mainly toforeign tourists and foreign residents of Beijing. But thecompany also hopes to attract Chinese customers, not yet usedto pizza.
