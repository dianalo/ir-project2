Under the agreement, Corning will give 49% of its consumerproducts assets and businesses to Vitro, a Mexican glassmaker with sales of $2.8 billion, in exchange for 49% ofVitro's consumer business and over $130 million in cash.Corning valued the transaction at $300 million.</LP><TEXT>   The new venture, to be called Corning Vitro Corp. in theU.S. and Vitro Corning S.A. in Mexico, will jointly produceand distribute such Corning brands as Corning Ware, Pyrex,Visions, Revere Ware and Corelle along with Vitro's glasswareand crystal. It will have sales of over $800 million, withneither side producing consumer housewares outside of theventure. Corning will not include its Steuben glass andSerengeti sunglasses in the venture.   The stock market responded favorably to the news, withCorning shares rising $1.50 to $65.625 in New York StockExchange composite trading.   Corning's operations will contribute some 75% of the jointventure's revenue, but analysts called the terms fair,because Vitro's business is more profitable and has beengrowing more rapidly.   The venture ends a long effort by the Corning, N.Y.,company to improve or dispose of its housewares unit. The76-year-old business, once the pride of Corning, haddeteriorated in the last decade, losing money and marketshare. The combination of the higher dollar and Corning'sstodgy product design allowed foreign firms to boost theirmarket share to 50% from 10%. Corning tried to rejuvenate itsline with Visions cookware in 1983, but the brand lostpopularity when the new products cooked unevenly and causedfood to stick to the surface.   Last year, consumer products accounted for 25% ofCorning's revenue but only 18% of its operating profit.Despite recent improvements, Chairman James R. Houghton saidthe business still &quot;was not meeting our goals.&quot; He saidCorning never entered talks to sell the unit and added thatthe venture with Vitro isn't intended to cast off thebusiness. &quot;This is not a first step to selling,&quot; he said.&quot;This is a real long-term venture.&quot;   Still, analysts viewed the venture as a signal thatCorning is prepared to complete its transition from dishes,pots and pans to fiber-optics, catalytic converters andlaboratory testing. &quot;It's a de-emphasis of the consumerbusiness in order to focus on areas generating the highreturns,&quot; said Bear Stearns analyst Morton Langer. Hepredicted the venture would improve Corning's return onassets while maintaining a broad research and developmenteffort.   The joint-venture strategy isn't new to Corning, whichalready has half of its revenues generated by joint venturessuch as Dow Corning Corp. and Samsung-Corning Co. With theVitro venture, which Corning expects to make definitive inOctober, two-thirds of its business will come from jointventures.</TEXT></DOC>
