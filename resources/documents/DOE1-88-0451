The regulation of the A-11 loci on boththe active and inactive X chromosomes is very easily perturbed. The A-11locus on the fibroblast-derived inactive X in a hybrid cell is reactivatedat a very high rate by 5-azacytidine, an inhibitor of DNA methylation,while the A-11 locus on the active X in B-lymphoblastoid cells is derepressedat a very high rate after gamma irradiation. The A-11 gene codes fora mature transcript of about 1.9 kb. The A-11 cDNA clone is incomplete,and contains 753 bases from the 3' end of the gene. A genomic clone thatcontains about 17 kb of human DNA and hybridizes to the A-11 cDNA wasisolated. This clone contains at least the last exon of the A-11 gene,as determined by Northern blotting, nuclease protection experiments,and DNA sequencing. When the genomic clone is transferred into mousecells. A-11 transcripts of both normal and abnormal sizes are produced,indicating that it is possible that the genomic clone contains the entirelocus. However, at this time, the 5' end of the gene has not been located.</TEXT></DOC>
