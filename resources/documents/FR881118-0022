One of the means of controllingthe export of that merchandise is by requiring that an export license,visa, or other quota document be obtained for the exportation. The chargepaid to obtain the license, visa or document is known as a quota charge.In order to properly assess duty on imported merchandise, the value ofthe merchandise must be determinied by Customs. Generally, the customsvalue of imported merchandise is the transaction value, which is the priceactually paid or payable for imported merchandise that is sold for exportationto the U.S. Currently, when Customs determines the value of imported merchandise,it distinguishes between quota charges which are paid by the buyer to theseller of the merchandise and those paid by the buyer to a party urelatedto the foreign seller. If paid by the buyer to the seller, Customs considersthe quota charges part of the transction value and accordingly, dutiable.If paid to an unrelated party, Customs has not considered the quota chargesdutiable. This document proposes that all quota charges paid as a prerequisite tothe exportation of foreign merchandise to the U.S. will be dutiable, regardlessof to whom they are paid. They will be considered part of the transactionvalue. This change is proposed as a result of Customs recent examinationof ``quota charge'' transactions revealing that payments for quota chargesare directly linked to the price actually paid or payable for importedmerchandise.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before January 17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments (preferably in triplicate) may be addressedto and inspected at the Regulations Control Branch, Room 2324, U.S. CustomsService, 1301 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20229.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Thomas L. Lobred, Classificationand Value Division (202-566-2938).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>U.S. Customs officers are required by law to appraise imported merchandiseto determine its value. Duty rates are usually assessed on the value ofthe merchandise. The valuation provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930 arefound in section 402 (19 U.S.C. 1401a), as amended by section 201, TradeAgreements Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-39). Sections 152.100 <T3>et seq.,</T3> Customs Regulations (19 CFR 152.100 <T3>et seq.</T3>), set forth the regulations governing the appraisementand valuation of merchandise.Generally, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1401a, the customs value of imported merchandiseis the transaction value. Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1401a(b), transaction valueis the price actually paid or payable for imported merchandise when itis sold for exportation to the U.S., plus certain additions not relevanthere. Pursuant to andSection; 152.103, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 152.103),the price actually paid or payable will be considered without regard toits method of derivation. Among other things, transaction value may bethe result of discounts, increases, or negotiations. The ``price actuallypaid or payable'' is defined in andSection; 152.102(f), Customs Regulations(19 CFR 152.102(f)), as the total payment (whether direct or indirect,and exclusive of any charges, costs, or expenses incurred for transportation,insurance, and related services incident to the international shipmentof the merchandise from the country of exportation to the place of importationin the U.S.) made, or to be made, for imported merchandise by the buyerto, or for the benefit of, the seller.<ITAG tagnum="84">Quotas</ITAG>A quota is a control set on the amount of certain merchandise that is eitherallowed to be imported into the U.S. or exported from another country tothe U.S. for a certain period of time so that a domestic interest can beprotected. Import quotas are generally established by legislation, by internationalagreements implemented through directives and by proclamations issued underthe authority contained in specific legislation. Quotas on the amount ofmerchandise permitted to be exported from a specific foreign country tothe U.S. are usually negotiated under bilateral or multilateral agreementsbetween the U.S. and other countries.A prime example of a trade agreement leading to a foreign country restrictingits exportations is the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles,known as the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA). Section 204, Agricultural Actof 1956 (7 U.S.C. 1854), authorizes the President to negotiate agreementswith other countries to limit their exports of ``any agricultural commodityor product manufactured therefrom or textiles or textile products'' andto limit U.S. importation of such articles. Under the authority of 7 U.S.C.1854, the U.S. is a party to the MFA. According to this trade agreement,the governments of textile supplier countries have agreed with the U.S.to control the exportation of textiles and apparel from those countries.If imports of a particular textile product from a participating exportingcountry are causing a market disruption in the U.S., the U.S. may suggestto the exporting country that a restraint level be set for the particularproduct by that country. If a bilateral agreement is not worked out withina certain time frame, the U.S. may then take unilateral action by establishingan import quota for that product.Pursuant to the MFA, bilateral agreements with various exporting countrieshave been entered into by the U.S., providing for a limitation or voluntaryrestraint by the foreign country on the amount of exports of specifiedcategories of textile products for specified periods.A variety of procedures have been instituted by foreign countries to restrainthe level of their exports.Some bilateral agreements provide that specific merchandise from a specificexporting country will not be permitted entry into the U.S. unless accompaniedby a visa from the exporting country. Other procedures involve the exportingcountry requiring the seller to obtain an export license or a quota documentbefore the merchandise can be exported.Sometimes, the exporting country grants the export licenses, visas, orquota documents without charge on a first come-first serve basis untilthe voluntary restraint level is met. In other isntances, it merely allocatesquotas on the basis of past performance (prior year's production), or theexporting country sells the export license, visa, or quota document tovarious manufacturers, middlemen, and/or importers.In some situations, the exporting country only allows the producer of thespecified merchandise to whom the quota was allocated by issuance of anexport license, visa or quota document to export the merchandise. In othercases, the exporting country permits the producer to transfer or resellhis quota allocation in total or in part to another producer of the specifiedmerchandise. In yet other cases, the exporting country may not requirethat the person/company to whom quota is allocated be a producer of thatcommodity. In this situation, that person/company obviously resells thequota allocation to another party.<ITAG tagnum="84">Quota Charges</ITAG>The charge paid to obtain an export license, visa, or any kind of quotadocument entitling specified merchandise to be exported when a limitationon exports for that commodity has been set is called a ``quota charge''.A quota charge is, in effect, a charge for the privilege of exporting thespecified merchandise to the U.S.<ITAG tagnum="84">Customs Current Practice</ITAG>In determining the transaction value of merchandise imported into the U.S.from foreign countries that have export controls on merchandise which resultin the payment of a quota charge by a producer, shipper or seller, Customshas held that such charges are dutiable as part of the ``price actuallypaid or payable for merchandise when sold for exportation to the UnitedStates,'' if the charges are included as part of the price for the merchandisepaid by the buyer to the seller. However, quota charges have not been consideredpart of ``the price actually paid or payable'' and, therefore, not considereddutiable, when such merchandise has been bought by a buyer from one sellerwhile the quota charge is paid by the same buyer to someone unrelated tothe seller. See, for example, ORR ruling letter 542169 dated September18, 1980 (TAA andplusmin;6) and ORR ruling letter 542150 dated January 6,1981 (TAA andplusmin;14). Customs rationale for this view has been that moneyspaid for quota charges directly to the seller by the buyer are part ofthe ``price actually paid or payable'' for the merchandise, but moneyspaid for quota charged by the buyer to an unrelated party to the sellerare not paid for the merchandise.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reasons for Proposed Change</ITAG>Customs' experience leads it to conclude that payments for quota chargesare directly linked to the payments made for imported merchandise. Wherequota status is a condition of export, and the importer cannot completethe transaction without obtaining quota, a transaction which does not includequota charges does not reflect the complete price of a sale for exportto the United States within the meaning of transaction value under 19 U.S.C.1401a(b). Therefore, payments for quota charges are part of ``the priceactually paid or payable when sold for export to the United States'' andshould be considered part of the transaction value. This conclusion isreflected in the three following situations:(1) Where the seller obtains quota, and includes the cost of obtainingit in the sales price paid by the buyer, the cost of quota is part of theprice actually paid when the merchandise is sold for export.(2) Where the seller obtains quota on behalf of the buyer, and the buyermakes a separate payment to the quota holder for the cost of quota, thecost of obtaining quota, combined with the cost of purchasing the merchandise,constitute the price when sold for export.(3) Where the buyer independently obtains its own quota from a party unrelatedto either the buyer or the seller, the cost of obtaining quota, combinedwith the cost of purchasing the merchandise, constitutes the price actuallypaid when sold for export.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>In accordance with this reasoning, Customs is proposing that quota chargesnecessary to export merchandise be included as part of ``the price actuallypaid or payable when sold for exportation to the United States,'' regardlessof which party initially pays the quota charge. Accordingly, it is proposedthat all payments of quota charges be considered as part of the transactionvalue of the merchandise and therefore dutiable.If this proposed interpretive rule is adopted, all prior Customs rulingswhich exempted from transaction value quota charges paid as a prerequisiteto the exportation of merchandise from foreign countries would be revoked,to the extent that they are inconsistent with this rule. Each of the recipientsof those rulings would be notified of Customs reversal of its positionpursuant to andSection; 177.9(d), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 177.9(d)).In making this proposal, Customs has taken note of previous Court cases,such as <T3>Panation Trade Co. </T3>v. <T3>United States</T3>, 54 Cust. Ct. 758, A.R.D. 181 (1965), and <T3>Sternfold </T3>v. <T3>United States</T3>, 12 Cust. Ct. App. 172, T.D. 40065 (1924), whichhave held certain export taxes or charges paid to a foreign governmentnot to be part of dutiable value in a sale for export. However, these caseswere so inherently tied to the concept of export value that they are notrelevant to the issue of whether quota charges should be deemed to be dutiablefor purposes of transaction value.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>Before adopting this proposal, consideration will be given to any writtencomments timely submitted to Customs. Comments submitted will be availablefor public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act(5 U.S.C. 552), andSection; 1.4, Treasury Department Regulations (31 CFR1.4), and andSection; 103.11(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 103.11(b)),on regular business days between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. atthe Regulations Control Branch, Room 2324, Customs Headquarters, 1301 ConstitutionAvenue NW., Washington, DC 20229.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal author of this document was Harold M.
