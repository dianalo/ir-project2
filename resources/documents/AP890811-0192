Both Congress and the Food and Drug Administration areconsidering massive revisions in the FDA's nutrition labelingrequirements, which date from 1973, when the vitamin and mineralcontent of foods was consumers' prime concern.   Now, much of the focus of healthy eating has shifted to foods'cholesterol, fat and fiber content _ areas untouched by the currentregulations.   Even the food industry, until now a foe of compulsory labeling,appears to be going along _ for a price.   Says Dr. Frank Young, the FDA commissioner:   ``The public is demanding change in this area and deservesnothing less than our maximum efforts to accomplish this change.''   Young, testifying before a congressional committee recently,referred to the two biggest driving forces behind the heightenedinterest in nutrition _ the Surgeon General's Report on Nutritionand Health, which cited dietary factors in five of the 10 leadingcauses of death, including cardiovascular disease and cancer, andthe report by the National Research Council, ``Diet and Health:Implications for Reducing Chronic Disease Risk.''   The FDA commissioner said both reports, issued last year,``concluded that Americans could substantially reduce their risk ofheart disease, cancer and many other chronic diseases throughspecific changes in eating habits.''   A survey of shoppers taken this year for a food industryorganization found that 94 percent of the poll's participants areconcerned about the nutritional content of what they eat.Thirty-eight percent said they were most concerned aboutcholestrol, a 16-point jump in just one year.   But the FDA and members of Congress disagree on how to give thepublic what it wants.   Since 1973, when the FDA imposed nutrition labeling requirementsfor the first time, products to which nutrients have been added orfor which a nutrition claim is made:   _Must be labeled with quantitative listings of calories,carbohydrates and protein.   _Must show, by ``average'' or ``usual'' serving, the percentagesof the federal government's recommended daily allowance of protein,vitamin A, vitamin C, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, calcium andiron contained in a product.   _Must list calories, protein content, carbohydrates, fat andsodium.   But those regulations were drawn up when vitamin and mineralcontent was the most prevalent consumer concern.   Now, what many shoppers want most is such information as aproduct's fat and fiber content, its ``liteness'' _ or lack thereof_ and how ``naturally'' it was made.   Some in Congress contend the FDA has not moved quickly enough toaddress those concerns.   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,have introduced the ``Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of1989.'' If passed by both houses, the bill's sponsors say revisedlabels could begin appearing within 18 months of being signed bythe president.   Twenty-three groups, including the American Heart Associationand American Cancer Society, have endorsed the bill.   The legislation would require that labels list the serving sizeand number of servings per container; total calories, and caloriesbroken down by total and saturated fat. Also required would beamounts, broken down by serving, of total, saturated andunsaturated fat; cholesterol; sodium; complex carbohydrates;protein; dietary fiber, and other nutrients.   The bill would also require that any health claims on labelsthat characterize the amount or relationship of calories, fat,cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, sugar, protein or dietary fiberto a disease or condition use terms defined by the secretary ofhealth and human services and that the definitions be supported bya scientific consensus.   Another bill, introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is similarto the Waxman-Metzenbaum bill except that it would preclude statelabeling regulations.   Perceptions of the two proposals vary predictably.   The FDA says congressional action isn't necessary, that it canmeet shoppers' needs without legislation. The grocery industrysupports the Hatch bill. Activist consumer groups say anylegislation that is adopted will need to address a variety ofnutrition issues not now covered.   For its part, the FDA plans to hold five hearings around thecountry to ask people how they would like to see the currentregulations changed.   For instance, the agency wants to know how much interest thereis in writing definitions for commonly used terms, such as ``lowsalt'' or ``reduced fat;'' whether there should be requirementsmanufacturers must meet in claiming their products help preventdisease; if minimum standards are needed to identify certain foods,and whether the public is willing to pay the added costs that wouldlikely accompany new labeling requirements.   From the comments at those hearings, which haven't been set, theFDA says it will revise its regulations and that the process shouldbe finished early in 1990.   The agency's intent is to convince Congress it need not set theFDA's standards, or at least to have revised regulations ready ifCapitol Hill orders the agency to change its act.   Young told Congress:   ``It is unclear whether legislation is necessary to achieve mostor all of our shared goals. I believe many, if not all, of thechanges contemplated can be made administratively.''   The food industry's primary hope appears to be getting federallegislation that eliminates state regulation.   Says Jeff Nedelman, a vice president of the GroceryManufacturers of America:   ``We would support a comprehensive reform of the dietary andhealth informaton that is provided to consumers if we can come outof this process with national standards.''   Seeking to avoid potentially 50 different state standards, theNational Food Processors Association says regulations ``appropriatefor Portland, Maine, are equally applicable to Portland, Ore.''   But some consumer groups say states should still have theprerogative to toughen federal standards and note that Californiaand New York, for instance, have often taken the lead in nutritionissues.   Whatever the new regulations are, these activists say they needto reflect a range of specific consumer interests not now addressedin the FDA requirements.   One group in the forefront of the movement to toughen labelingrequirements, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, saysthe regulations should:   _Eliminate or supplement the description of quantities asmeasured in ``grams,'' a metric term, unless accompanied by definedterms such as high, low or medium.   _Eliminate thiamin, riboflavin and niacin from labels, sincedeficiencies in those elements are no longer a significant healththreat.   _List amounts of fat, cholesterol, ``cholesterol-raising'' orsaturated fats, sodium, starch, dietary fiber and sugar.   _Consider a diagram giving percentages of protein, sugar,complex carbohydrates, total fat and saturated fat.   _List the percentage of a product's major ingredients, such assugar and flour.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug 13</NOTE></DOC>
