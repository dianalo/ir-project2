The cash price wasn't disclosed.    Ovest will be combined with Marine Midland Brokerage Service, the banking company's existing discount brokerage operation, but will retain its name. A spokesman for the banking company said the acquisition will quadruple its customer base and trading volume. Ovest has a staff of 15 registered representatives and a single office in Manhattan; Marine has one office and five representatives, but also offers the discount brokerage service through its 322 branches in New York state.    Under current regulations, bank-owned broker-dealers can buy and sell stocks, bonds, and mutual funds on customers' orders, but can't offer them investment advice or portfolio management services. </TEXT></DOC>
