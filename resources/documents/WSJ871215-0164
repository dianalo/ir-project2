Mr. Girolami estimated sales at #770 million, up 6% from a year earlier. If not for the pound's increase, he said, sales would have totaled #880 million, up 21%. Forty percent of the company's sales are in North America.    The chairman also said that a slowing in Glaxo's growth is &quot;inevitable, until the time when new products now in the pipeline are put on the market.&quot; Glaxo's revenue and profit have advanced &quot;at an extraordinary rate&quot; in recent years, he said. But, he noted, the results &quot;cannot and could not be expected to go on growing at those exceptional rates year after year.&quot;    Glaxo fell 39 pence (71.9 cents), to 981 pence ($18.09), on London's stock exchange yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
