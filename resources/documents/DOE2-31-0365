One major reason was the collapseof oil prices which set off price competition from residual fuel oilin dual-fired boiler installations. Data are presented to illustrateand explain regional differences in the loss of gas demand. The paperalso analyzes the complexity of the natural gas supply/demand curve.Effects on the market from wellhead price controls, inflexible contracts,natural gas reserve additions, and the allocation of costs between oiland gas are also discussed. The paper concludes that the critical elementto watch will be the effect on gas drilling activity of the natural gasprice increase which the author expects to see as the gas surplus ends.</TEXT></DOC>
