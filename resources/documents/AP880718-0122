I just want to get warm,'' were the last words ofGary Silver, 40, of Spokane, Wash., according to his friend GarySpeer, who was with him on an expedition that took them toGasherbrum 2, a 26,400-foot peak in the Karakorum range in thewestern Himalayas.   Speer, 36, returned to Islamabad on Sunday.   Speer and Silver left the Pakistani capital city along with twoother American climbers, who abandoned the expedition at the outsetwhen one of them couldn't breathe at the high altitude.   On July 1, Speer and Silver, who had had climbing experience inNorth and South America, headed up from a base camp at 17,000 feet.   At 19,000 feet, Silver also became sick and decided to return tothe base camp, while Speer continued alone.   When he came to within 100 feet of the peak, high winds forcedhim to descend to 23,000 feet. There, he found Silver, who hadteamed up with a Canadian doctor, Roland Willenbrock, to try toreach the top of the mountain.   The two ignored Speer's warning that a snowstorm was brewing andcontinued toward the summit. The exhausted Speer headed back.   For three days, a blizzard trapped Silver and Willenbrock at acamp at 24,000 feet.   On July 8, the two began their descent, but at 23,000 feetSilver could not continue and Willenbrock contacted Speer by radio.   According to Willenbrock, Silver told the doctor, ``I'm going todie.''   He later became unconscious and died from cerebral edema, aswelling of the brain from lack of oxygen.   Willenbrock began walking toward the lower camp in the blizzardand mostly in the dark to reach Speer at the lower camp.   On July 9 at 3 a.m., Speer mounted a rescue party of two Swissand two American climbers to find Silver's body.   The doctor, who had planned to specialize in heart surgery,suffered frostbite and will lose some of the fingers on his righthand, Speer said.</TEXT></DOC>
