Theestimated weighted-average margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation''section of this notice. We also preliminarily determine that critical circumstancesexist with respect to imports of certain classes or kinds of AFBs fromItaly, as outlined in the ``Critical Circumstances'' section of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Case History</ITAG>Since the notice of initiation (53 FR 15075, April 27, 1988), the followingevents have occurred. On May 17, 1988, the ITC determined that there isreasonable indication that U.S. industries are materially injured by reasonof imports of the subject merchandise from Italy (53 FR 18909, May 25,1988).On May 31, 1988, the Department presented Section A of the antidumpingduty questionnaires to FAG Cuscinetti S.p.A. (FAG); Industria CuscinettiS.p.A. (ICSA); and RIV-SKF Officine Di Villar Perose, S.p.A. (SKF). Thesecompanies account for a substantial portion of exports of the subject merchandisefrom Italy to the United States during the period of investigation.The remaining sections of the questionnaire were issued on June 15, 1988.Responses to Section A were due on June 14, 1988, and responses to theremaining sections were due on July 15, 1988.On July 13, 1988, we issued a decision memorandum stating that the subjectmerchandise constitutes five classes or kinds of merchandise (<T3>see, </T3>``Class or Kind of Merchandise'' section of this notice).In light of this decision, the Department re-examined the sufficiency ofpetitioner's less than fair value (LTFV) allegations for each class orkind of merchandise from Italy. The Department afforded petitioner an opportunityto provide additional information in support of its LTFV allegations forparticular classes or kinds of merchandise where needed. On August 1, 2,and 29, 1988, petitioner submitted additional data. We determined thatpetitioner provided sufficient information in support of the LTFV allegationsfor each class or kind of merchandise from Italy.However, since plain bearings enter the United States under a basket TSUSAcategory, we are unable to definitively establish whether plain bearingswere imported from Italy during the period of investigation. In addition,we are unable to specifically identify any Italian exporters of plain bearingsto the United States. Therefore, we have preliminarily determined thatplain bearings from Italy are not being, or are likely to be, sold in theUnited States at less than fair value. We will continue to attempt to establishwhether plain bearings from Italy were imported and attempt to identifyany Italian exporters of plain bearings to the United States during theperiod of investigation for purposes of our final determination.On July 15, 1988, the Department determined that these investigations areextraordinarily complicated in accordance with section 733(c)(1)(B)(i)of the Act, and postponed the preliminary determinations until no laterthan October 27, 1988 (53 FR 27738, July 22, 1988).On August 8, 1988, we issued revised reporting requirements based on ourdecision to simplify these investigations (<T3>see, </T3>``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice).Accordingly, response deadlines were extended several times, with the finaldue date for responses being no later than September 6, 1988. A numberof supplemental and deficiency questionnaires were issued subsequent tothat date. Supplemental responses were received from the respondents priorto these preliminary determinations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Standing</ITAG>During the period April 27 through September 29, 1988, we received numeroussubmissions from parties challenging The Torrington Company's standingto file the petition and requesting dismissal of the petition on the groundsthat it was not filed by ``an interested party'' ``on behalf of'' the UnitedStates industry as required by section 732(b)(1) of the Act. Section 771(9)(c)of the Act defines ``interested party'' to include ``a manufacturer, producer,or wholesaler in the United States of a like product.'' With the exceptionof an additional category for ``other antifriction devices,'' the ITC categorizationof the subject merchandise into six like products is identical to the fiveclasses or kinds of merchandise subject to these investigations. Torringtonhas demonstrated that it produces all five classes or kinds of the subjectmerchandise. Therefore, Torrington is a manufacturer, producer or wholesalerein the United States of the like products under investigation, and is an``interested party'' with standing to file this petition.The statutory provision that governs the standing of parties to bring petitionsrequires the commencement of an investigation ``whenever an interestedparty * * * files a petition * * * on behalf of an industry.'' Section732(b)(1) of the Act. As we have stated in prior cases [<T3>see, e.g., Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination; CertainStainless Steel Hollow Products from Sweden </T3>(52 FR 5794, February28, 1987) and <T3>Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determinations; Certain TextileMill Products and Apparel from Malaysia </T3>(50 FR 9852, March 12, 1985)],the Department relies upon the petitioner's representations that it hasfiled ``on behalf of'' the domestic industry until it is shown that a majorityof the domestic industry affirmatively opposes the petition. The Departmentbases this position on the fact that neither the Act nor its legislativehistory restricts access to the unfair trade laws by requiring that partiespetitioning for relief under these laws establish affirmatively that amajority of the members of the relevant domestic industry support the petition.The only requirement is that the party filing the petition act as the representativeof the domestic industry.When a member of the domestic industry challenges the assertion of thepetitioner that it has filed ``on behalf of'' the domestic industry, theburden is on the opponent to establish that the petitioner does not havethe support of a majority of the domestic industry. To meet this requirement,the opponent must provide evidence that at least a majority of the domesticindustry affirmatively opposes the petition. Where domestic industry membersopposing a petition provide a clear indication that there are grounds todoubt a petitioner's standing, the Department will evaluate the oppositionto determine whether the opposing parties do, in fact, represent a majorproportion of the domestic industry.In order to determine whether a major proponent of the domestic industryopposes the petition, on October 14, 1988, we issued a questionnaire tothose parties challenging the standing of The Torrington Company. Responsesto the standing questionnaires are due on October 28, 1988. We will continueto examine the standing issue for purposes of the final determinations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigations</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules will be fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule</T3> (HTS) and all the merchandise enteredor withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after that date willbe classified solely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s). Untilthat time, however, the Department will be providing both the appropriate<T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated</T3> (TSUSA) item number(s)and the appropriate HTS item number(s) with its product descriptions. Aswith the TSUSA, the HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customspurposes. The Department's written description of the products under investigationremains dispositive as to the scope of the product coverage.We are requesting petitions to include the appropriate HTS item number(s)as well as the TSUSA item number(s) in all petitions filed with the Departmentthrough the end of this year. A reference copy of the HTS is availablefor consultation in the Central Records Unit, Room B-099, U.S. Departmentof Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230.Additionally, all U.S. Customs offices have reference copies, and petitionersmay contact the import specialist at their local Customs office to consultthe schedule.For a complete description of the products subject to these investigations,see Appendix I attached to this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Class or Kind of Merchandise</ITAG>In our notice of initiation (53 FR 15076, April 27, 1988) we treated thesubject merchandise as one ``class or kind of merchandise.'' Subsequentto initiation, we received numerous comments from petitioner, respondents,and other interested parties in these investigations on whether the subjectmerchandise constitutes one or more classes or kinds of merchandise. Aftercareful consideration of all views expressed, and based on our discussionswith product experts at the U.S. Customs Service, the ITC, and within theDepartment, we issued a decision memorandum on July 13, 1988, stating thatthe subject merchandise constitutes five separate classes or kinds of merchandise,as follows:1. Ball Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof (Ball Bearings)2. Spherical Roller Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof (SphericalRoller Bearings)3. Cylindrical Roller Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof(Cylindrical Roller Bearings)4. Needle Roller Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof (NeedleRoller Bearings)5. Plain Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof (Plain Bearings)This July 13, 1988 decision memorandum is on file in the Central RecordsUnit.<ITAG tagnum="84">Alternative Reporting Requirements</ITAG>Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.38(a), the Department ``normally will examine atleast 60 percent of the dollar volume of exports to the United States fromany country subject to an antidumping investigation.'' Due to the enormousvolume of sales by respondents during the period of investigation and thecomplexity of identifying similar merchandise, we have attempted to reducethe reporting requirements for respondents while maintaining a reasonablebasis for our analysis. Accordingly, on July 15, 1988, we issued a letterto all interested parties requesting comments on two alternatives to ourstandard methodology. One alternative was to select at random a certainnumber of products sold in the United States and to compare the U.S. pricesfor those products with the home market prices of identical or similarmerchandise, as appropriate.The second alternative was as follows: if at least 33 percent by volumeof the respondent's U.S. sales could be compared to home market sales ofidentical products, then fair value comparisons would be limited to identicalcomparisons. If a respondent failed to reach the 33 percent requirementwith identical matches, then, in addition to identical comparisons, wewould compare the largest volume products sold in the United States tosimilar products sold in the home market within each class or kind categoryuntil the 33 percent threshold was met. After reviewing comments from interested parties on this issue, we selectedthe second alternative. The August 5, 1988 memorandum outlining the proceduresoutlined above is on file in the Central Records Unit. <ITAG tagnum="84">Cost of Production Allegations</ITAG>Based on information presented in the petition and supplemental submission,on April 20, 1988, we initiated an investigation of sales at LTFV fromItaly. At that time, we also initiated an investigation of whether salesin the home market were being made at prices below the cost of production(COP). As stated above, on July 13, 1988, we issued a decision memorandumstating that the products under investigation constitute five separateclasses or kinds of merchandise. (<T3>See</T3>, ``Class or Kind of Merchandise'' section of this notice.)Accordingly, on July 22, 1988, the Department requested that petitionersubmit evidence of sales at below the COP for each class or kind of merchandiseunder investigation for which sufficient information had not been provided.In addition, several respondents objected to the Department's decisionto initiate COP investigations. Citing <T3>Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp. v. United States</T3>, 575 F. Supp. 1277(CIT 1983) (<T3>Al Tech</T3>, these respondents argued that petitioner's sales belowcost allegations were deficient because they were based on country-wide,rather than company-specific home market pricing data. After review ofthese comments, the <T3>Al Tech </T3>decision, and Section 773(b), on August 22, 1988, we discontinuedthe COP investigations, but allowed petitioner additional time to submitcompany-specific home market price information to substantiate its allegationsof sales at below the COP. The August 22, 1988 decision memorandum outliningour analysis of this issue is on file in the Central Records Unit. Petitionersubmitted such new allegations of home market and third country sales belowthe COP, as appropriate. After analyzing petitioner's new allegations and the numerous supplementsthereto, we have determined that sufficient company-specific allegationshave been provided with respect to the following:<ITAG tagnum="14">1. Ball Bearings_SKF, FAG</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">2. Spherical Roller Bearings_FAG</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Therefore, the Department has reinstated COP investigations for thesecompanies with respect to the classes or kinds of AFBs listed above. <ITAG tagnum="84">Voluntary Respondents</ITAG>On July 1, 1988, we issued questionnaires to companies which had expressedan interest in submitting voluntary responses in these investigations.However, no responses were received. <ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation</ITAG>The period of investigation is October 1, 1987 through March 31, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Such or Similar Comparisons</ITAG>To determine whether there are sufficient sales of the subject merchandisein the home market to serve as the basis for calculating foreign marketvalue, we normally compare the volume of home market sales to the volumeof sales to third countries within each respective such or similar category.In developing criteria for such or similar comparisons, we reviewed thematching criteria set forth in <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Tapered RollerBearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, from Japan</T3>, (52FR 30790, August 17, 1987). In addition, we sought and considered commentsfrom interested parties and consulted product experts at the U.S. CustomsService, the ITC, and within the Department. Given the enormous numberof products sold and the numerous physical permutations among bearing types,it would have been virtually impossible to determine home market viabilitybased on such or similar categories within each class or kind of merchandise.Therefore, home market viability was calculated based on home market andthird country sales of each class or kind of merchandise. Pursuant to our alternative reporting requirements, where 33 percent ormore of U.S. sales by volume were identical in all physical respects tohome market products, comparisons of similar merchandise were unnecessary(<T3>see</T3>, ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice).In those instances where similar comparisons were necessary for a givenclass or kind of merchandise, we instructed respondents first to narrowthe pool of possible product comparisons by matching each of the followingcriteria: (1) Number of rows of rolling elements, (2) load direction, (3)bearing design, and (4) precision rating. Respondents were then to applya ten percent deviation test to each bearing in this pool of possible productcomparison based on the (a) outside diameter, (b) inside diameter, (c)width, and (d) dynamic load rating to determine the most similar home marketcomparison. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons</ITAG>To determine whether sales of certain AFBs from Italy to the United Stateswere made at less than fair value, we compared the United States priceto the foreign market value as specified in the ``United States Price''and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. In accordance withsection 776(c) of the Act, where a company has failed to respond to ourquestionnaire, has submitted a response which we consider to be substantiallydeficient, or has submitted information too late to be considered for purposesof these preliminary determinations, we relied on best information available.Those instances where we used best information available are fully describedbelow. <ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price</ITAG>For those sales where the sales to the first unrelated purchaser took placeafter importation into the United States, we based United States priceon exporter's sales price (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of theAct. The calculation of United States price for each class or kind of merchandisefor each respondent is detailed below. I. Ball BearingsA. <T3>FAG</T3>: FAG reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See</T3>, ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. All of FAG's U.S. sales were ESP transactions. We calculated ESP basedon packed, c.i.f., and delivered prices to unrelated customers in the UnitedStates. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for containerization,foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, marine insurance, oceanfreight, U.S. inland freight, U.S brokerage and handling, U.S. duties,U.S. inland insurance, and repacking in the United States, in accordancewith section 772(d)(2) of the Act. We also made deductions for discountsand rebates. We made further deductions from ESP, where appropriate, foradvertising, commissions, credit, technical services, third party payments,warranty expenses, and indirect selling expenses, pursuant to sections772(e) (1) and (2) of the Act. FAG claimed an adjustment for losses or gains under ``other revenue'' onESP sales. This loss or gain represents the per-unit difference betweenthe actual return in lira to FAG and the theoretical return in lira FAGexpected to receive at the time FAG priced its products, due fluctuationsin exchange rates. Since these products were actually priced and paid forin U.S. dollars, there is no need to adjust the United States price. Therefore,we disallowed this adjustment. For certain transactions, no amounts were reported for brokerage and handling,duty, technical services, U.S. inland freight, credit, and warranty expenses.As best information available, we found the average of each of the expensesand compared it to the average gross price reported. The resultant percentageswere then applied, individually, to the gross price reported for each transactionin which these expenses were not reported. We have excluded from our calculation of United States price sales of bearingsby FAG to the U.S. government for military/defense procurement. These saleswere made under Schedule 8 of the TSUSA and will not be subject to anyantidumping duties. [<T3>See, e.g., Final Affirmative Antidumping Duty Determination; TitaniumSponge from Japan,</T3> (49 FR 38687, October 1, 1984).] These importswere made prior to enactment of Section 1335 of the Omnibus Trade and CompetitivenessAct of 1988 and will not be subject to suspension of liquidation. Withrespect to any future sales to the U.S. government, we will determine whetherthese sales are exempt from antidumping duties pursuant to the terms ofsection 1335 of the 1988 Act. B. <T3>SKF:</T3> SKF reported that less than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the third country but did notprovide enough third country matches of similar merchandise to reach the33 percent threshold. (<T3>See, </T3>``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)Lacking these comparisons, we have applied best information available forthose sales which would achieve the 33 percent threshold. We have usedthe margin calculated as best information available since this rate washigher than the rate provided in the petition for this class or kind ofmerchandise from Italy. We calculated ESP based on packed, f.o.b. or delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate,for brokerage and handling, duty, inland freight, marine insurance, andocean freight, in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Act. We alsomade deductions, where appropriate, for cash discounts and rebates. Wemade further deductions from ESP, where approprite, for credit, directselling expenses, ``other expenses,'' repacking, technical services, warrantyexpenses, and indirect selling expenses, pursuant to sections 772(e) (1)and (2) of the Act. SKF reported a minimal amount of purchase price sales during the POI; however,SKF did not report complete sales data for these transactions. For boththese reasons, we did not include any purchase price sales in our calculationof United States price. SKF notified us that approximately one percent of its reported U.S. salesof ball bearings were produced in a country other than Italy. SKF claimsthat although it is impossible for them to separate sales of this merchandisefrom that produced in Italy, United States price of multiple sourced productsare comparable. While we will carefully examine this issue at verification,we have included all reported sales in our calculation of United Statesprice as best information available. SKF claimed that the category ``other expenses'' should be used as an adjustmentto its United States price to account for data entry and invoicing errors.The data included both positive and negative values. Given that SKF didnot provide any information regarding how this adjustment should be treated,<T3>i.e., </T3>whether it should be added or subtracted from United Statesprice, we added these expenses to United States price. II. Spherical Roller Bearings  A. <T3>FAG: </T3>During the period of investigation, all FAG's sales of sphericalroller bearings were made to the U.S. government for military/defense procurement.As explained above under the ``Ball Bearings'' section, these sales arenot subject to antidumping duties. Because we are not using such salesto calculate United States price, we have no basis for determining whetherFAG's sales of spherical roller bearings are at less than fair value. Forany sales of this product by FAG which are not exempt from antidumpingduties, the ``All Other Rate'' will apply.  B. <T3>ICSA: </T3>ICSA reported that more than 33 percent by volume of itsU.S. sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (see ``AlternativeReporting Requirements'' section of this notice) Therefore, we have usedall U.S. sales with identical home market matches in our price-to-pricecomparisons.  All of ICSA's U.S. sales were ESP transactions. We calculated ESP basedon packed, f.o.b. prices to unrelated customers in the United States. Wemade deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for brokerage and handling,foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, marine insurance, oceanfreight, U.S. duty, and U.S. inland freight, in accordance with section772(d)(2) of the Act. We also made deductions for discounts. We made furtherdeductions from ESP, where appropriate, for advertising, commissions, credit,technical services, and indirect selling expenses, pursuant to sections772(e)(1) and (2) of the Act.  ICSA calculated credit expense based on the average number of days frominvoicing to payment. We have recalculated credit expense based on theactual number of days accounts receivable were outstanding.  For certain transactions, no amounts were reported for brokerage and handling,packing, foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, marine insurance,ocean freight, U.S. duty, U.S. inland freight and indirect non-U.S. sellingexpenses. As best information available, we found the average of each ofthe expenses and compared it to the average gross price reported. The resultantpercentages were then applied, individually, to the gross price reportedfor each transaction in which these expenses were not reported.   III. Cylindrical Roller Bearings <T3>SKF: </T3>In its original questionnaire response, SKF stated that ithad sales of cylindrical roller bearings and needle roller bearings inthe United States during the period of investigation, but reported inadequatesales information for United States price and failed to report any informationfor foreign market value. SKF later informed the Department that this informationwas not provided because there were no sales of such or similar merchandisein the home market during the period of investigation. We requested thatUnited States price and constructed value information be provided in accordancewith section 773(a)(2) of the Act. Although this information was subsequentlysubmitted, it was not received in time for use in our preliminary determination.Therefore, we used, as best information available, the highest rate providedby petitioner for this class or kind of merchandise. If we are unable toverify the information submitted by SKF, we will continue to use best informationavailable to calculate the United States price and constructed value inour final determination. However, best information available for purposesof the final determination may be different from the information used forthis preliminary determination.   IV. Needle Roller Bearings  <T3>SKF: </T3>We used best information available for purposes of this determinationas explained above for cylindrical roller bearings.<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value  </ITAG>In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on home market sales and, where appropriate, third countrysales. The calculation of foreign market value for each respondent is detailedbelow.   I. Ball Bearings  A. <T3>FAG: </T3>We calculated foreign market value based on packed and deliveredprices to unrelated customers in the home market. We added interest revenueearned on each transaction, where appropriate. We made deductions fromhome market price, where appropriate, for inland freight, inland insurance,home market packing, and discounts and rebates. FAG failed to report U.S.packing. Therefore, we used home market packing expenses as best informationavailable, and added this amount to foreign market value, in accordancewith section 773(a)(1) of the Act.  Since all U.S. transactions involved ESP, we made further deductions fromhome market price, where appropriate, for credit, technical services, andwarranty expenses. We also deducted certain indirect selling expenses andcommissions in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c). Since all home marketproducts used in fair value comparions are identical to the products soldin the United States, no adjustments for physical differences in merchandisewere required.  FAG claimed advertising and the cost of shipping sample bearings as directselling expenses. However, its claims were not adequately supported. Therefore,we have treated these expenses as indirect selling expenses for purposesof this determination.  FAG's response included a claim for ``indirect selling expenses''. Althoughrequested in our original and supplemental questionnaires, FAG failed toprovide an itemized breakdown of the indirect expenses claimed. Therefore,we have disallowed these expenses for purposes of this preliminary determination.If the appropriate information is submitted and verified, we will considerit for the final determination.  B. <T3>SKF: </T3>Following the methodology for determining home market viability,we found that the home market sales of ball bearings were not of a sufficientquantity to provide an adequate basis for foreign market value. (<T3>See, </T3>``Such or Similar'' section of this notice.) In our originalquestionnaire, we had requested that respondent provide third country salesinformation where the home market was determined to be not viable. SKFdid not provide us with this information. Therefore, on September 16, 1988,we issued a letter to SKF again requesting third country sales data. OnSeptember 23, 1988, SKF submitted arguments challenging the Department'sfinding that the home market is not viable, while also providing the Departmentwith the requested third country sales data for sales to the Federal Republicof Germany, its largest third country market for sales of ball bearingsfrom Italy.  We calculated foreign market value based on delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the third country market. We made deductions, where appropriate,for export packing expenses, foreign inland freight, and inland freight.We added U.S. packing to the third country price, in accordance with section773(a)(1) of the Act. Since all U.S. transactions involved ESP, we made further deductions, whereappropriate, for credit and warranty expenses. We also deducted certainindirect selling expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c). Since allthird country products used in fair value comparisons are identical tothe products sold in the United States, no adjustments for physical differencesin merchandise were required.SKF's response included a claim for third country ``indirect selling expense''.Although requested in our original and supplemental questionnaires, SKFfailed to provide an itemized breakdown of the indirect expenses claimed.Therefore, we have disallowed these expenses for purposes of this preliminarydetermination. If the appropriate information is submitted and verified,we will consider it for the final determination.SKF claimed cash discounts, rebates, technical service expenses, as directselling expenses. However, these claims were not adequately supported.Therefore, we treated these expenses as indirect selling expenses.SKF also claimed an adjustment for a category labelled ``other expenses''.However, no description of these expenses was provided. Therefore, theseexpenses were disallowed.II. Spherical Roller BearingsA. <T3>FAG</T3>: We have not calculated foreign market value for FAG's salesof spherical roller bearings as explained above under the ``United StatesPrice'' section for spherical roller bearings.B. <T3>ICSA</T3>: We calculated foreign market value based on packed, deliveredprices to unrelated customers in the home market. We added interest revenueearned on each transaction, where appropriate. We made deductions fromthe home market price, where appropriate, for inland freight, inland insurance,packing, and rebates. We added U.S. packing to the home market price, inaccordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.Since all U.S. transactions involved ESP, we made further deductions fromhome market price, where appropriate, for credit. We also deducted indirectselling expenses and commissions, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c).Since all third country products used in fair value comparisons are identicalto the products sold in the United States, no adjustments for physicaldifferences in merchandise were required.III. Cylindrical Roller Bearings<T3>SKF</T3>: We used best information available for purposes of this determinationas explained above under the ``Untied States Price'' section for cylindricalroller bearings.IV. Needle Roller Bearings<T3>SKF:</T3> We used best information available for purposes of this determinationas explained above under the ``United States Price'' section for cylindricalroller bearings.<ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Coversion</ITAG>We used the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of U.S. sales,in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act, as amended by section615 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984.

Section733(e)(1) of the Act provides that critical circumstances exist if we determinethat there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A)(i) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhereof the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise wasimported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value;and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.</ITAG>Pursuant to section 733(e)(1)(B), we generally consider the following factorsin determining whether imports have been massive over a relatively shortperiod of time: (1) The volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends(if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted forby imports.We have determined in past investigations whether imports have been massiveby examining the Department's import data. However, because the Department'simport data pertaining to the subject merchandise are based on basket TSUSAcategories, we determined in these investigations that company-specificdata on shipments of the subject merchandise are the most appropriate basisfor our preliminary determinations of critical circumstances. Furthermore,we beleive that company-specific critical circumstances determinationsbetter fulfill the objective of the critical circumstances provision ofdeterring specific companies that may try to increase imports massivelyprior to the suspension of liquidation.We have asked all respondents in each of the AFB investigations to supplymonthly volume shipment data from January 1986 through the present in orderfor the Department to base the critical circumstances determinations oncompany-specific data. SKF has failed to provide the Department with shipmentdata for ball bearings. Therefore, as best information available, we areassuming that imports of ball bearings from SKF have been massive overa relatively short period of time. Based on our analysis of the monthlyshipment data submitted by respondents, we have preliminarily found thatthere is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that imports of the followingclasses or kinds of merchandise from the companies listed below have beenmassive over a relatively short period of time.1. Ball Bearings_FAG, SKF. Therefore, we find that the requirements ofsection 733(e)(1)(B) are met for the above companies and classes or kindsof merchandise.We examined recent antidumping duty cases and found that there are currentlyno findings of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the subjectmerchandise by Italian manufacturers, producers, and exporters of the subjectmerchandise. However, it is our standard practice to impute knowledge ofdumping under section 733(e)(1)(A) of the Act when the estimated marginsin our determinations are of such a magnitude that the importer shouldrealize that dumping exists with regard to the subject merchandise. Normallywe consider estimated margins of 25 percent or greater to be sufficient.[<T3>See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; TaperedRoller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished, from Italy</T3>(52 FR 24198, June 29, 1987).] However, in cases where the foreign manufacturersells in the United States through a related company, we consider thatlower margins may be sufficnet. [<T3>See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; CertainInternal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan</T3> (53 FR12552, April 15, 1988).] Since FAG and ICSA sell in the United States throughrelated companies, and because there rates are sufficiently high, we findthat the requirements of section 733(e)(1)(A) are met for FAG with respectto ball bearings and ICSA with respect to spherical roller bearings. Therefore,the following chart sets forth our company-specific preliminary determinationswith respect to the existence of critical circumstances for each companyand each class or kind of merchandise from Italy.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,tp0,i1,s10,xls30</C> <H1> </H1><H1>Critical Circumstances</H1><ITAG tagnum="2">FAG <D>Yes</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">SKF <D>Yes</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All Others<D>Yes</D></ITAG>Spherical Roller Bearings:<ITAG tagnum="2">ICSA <D>No</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All Others<D>No</D></ITAG>Cylindrical Roller Bearings:<ITAG tagnum="2">SKF <D>No</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All Others<D>No</D></ITAG>Needle Roller Bearings:<ITAG tagnum="2">SKF <D>No</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All Others<D>No</D></ITAG></ITAG>VerificationWe will verify the information used in making our final determinationsin accordance with section 776(b) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>In accordance with section 733(d) of the Act, we are directing the U.S.Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of the subject merchandisefrom Italy, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigations'' section of thisnotice, with the exception of entries of plain bearings, that are enteredor withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publicationof this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, in accordance with section 733(d)(1) of theAct.
