 400 on Reader Service CardandM;Lotus 1-2-3 for VAX/VMS has been shimmering like a mirage in the distanceever since Lotus first promised its release.andP;  Now Lotus has made good on itsword, introducing a VAX/VMS version of 1-2-3 that offers the familiar PCinterface in combination with added features and performance made possible bythe power of the VAX platform.andM;Lotus 1-2-3 for VAX/VMS is compatible with 1-2-3 for the PC, except that some1-2-3 macros created on PC platforms won't work in the VAX/VMS environment.andO;The compatibility of the PC and VAX/VMS versions is appealing for tworeasons.andP;  First, it allows VAX sites to further centralize computingoperations and management: 1-2-3 users who've been exiled to small PC islandscan finally seek refuge on the VAX mainland.andM;Sites where PCs and VAXes are networked together also benefit, because thecompatibility of the PC and VAX implementations allows PC and VAX users toshare the same worksheet files.andP;  PC users can make their files available to1-2-3 VAX users by saving their worksheet files on virtual disks on the VAX,and VAX users can do the same for PC users.andM;ALL THE GOODS, AND MOREandM;Lotus 1-2-3 for VAX/VMS, like its PC counterpart, provides all the standardfeatures that users would expect from a spreadsheet package, as well as a fewextras.andP;  (See table on page 50.)andP;  All-in-1 support has been incorporated intothis version of 1-2-3.andP;  Futhermore, the VAX/VMS implementation runs underDECwindows, allowing users to take advantage of bit-mapped graphics andpop-up windows.andM;Named cell ranges, macros, iterative calculations, string searching,auto-calculation mode, independent scrolling windows and programmable keysmake up only a subset of 1-2-3's many features.andP;  Users can display ReGISgraphics (or, when running DECwindows, bit-mapped graphics) on their terminalscreens.andP;  1-2-3 also supports PostScript and Hewlett Packard's Print CommandLanguage (HP PCL).andP;  But that's only the beginning.andM;The new release introduces several eye-catching features to pleasespreadsheet users.andP;  For example, 1-2-3 for VAX/VMS offers a three-dimensionalworksheet capability, allowing users to create and view multisheet files.andO;Multiple sheets can be used, for example, to represent 10-year incomestatements for several companies; each company's income statement would berepresented by a separate sheet in the worksheet.andM;Lotus 1-2-3 for VAX/VMS also includes a file-linking capability -- a featurethat allows users to reference cells from many different worksheet files --and a query interface to Rdb that lets users connect their databases to1-2-3.andP;  Interfaces for other databases -- such as Ingres, Oracle and Sybase-- are under development.andM;The product also offers useful file administration features, such as filereservation, password protection and file sealing.andP;  The Reservations menuoption prevents more than one user from having simultaneous write access to aworksheet file.andP;  Users with reservations can modify a worksheet file and savethe changes under the same file name.andP;  Users without a reservation can accessthe file, but they must save their changes under a different file name.andP;  Thisfeature is extremely important in multiuser environments, where files arefrequently shared.andM;VMS provides its own file protection scheme, but it isn't always enough todiscourage the highly privileged snoop.andP;  Lotus' password-protection featureallows users to add an extra measure of file security by associating apassword with a 1-2-3 worksheet file.andP;  1-2-3 doesn't include a fileencryption capability.andM;The file-sealing feature allows users to seal 1-2-3 settings -- includinggraph, print, range, worksheet and reservation settings -- for a specifiedfile.andP;  Sealed files can be read into 1-2-3, but the sealed settings cannot bemodified.andM;Although users can take advantage of as many as 8,192 rows, the maximumnumber of columns is limited to 256 -- a holdover from the PC environment.andO;These dimensions will certainly be adequate for most spreadsheet users, butsome users may have difficulty importing large worksheets from otherspreadsheet packages -- such as Access Technology's 20/20 -- which handle asmany as 1,000 columns.andP;  Other users may simply require more than 256 columns:For example, a securities analyst may need a very large worksheet to trackthe daily closes of several corporate stock issues over one or more years.andM;When users require more than 256 columns but less than 256 rows, they cancircumvent the spreadsheet size limitation by transposing columns and rows.andO;But at other times -- when users need more than 256 columns and more than 256rows -- the column limitation may still cause problems.andM;3-D: NO GLASSES REQUIREDandM;During the 1-2-3 installation procedure, the DCL tables are updatedautomatically so that users can invoke 1-2-3 by entering LOTUS/123 at the DCLprompt.andP;  All versions of 1-2-3 offer a common user interface: 1-2-3 looks thesame whether users are running it on a PC, a VAX, or a Sun work-station.andM;Because most spreadsheet users have worked either with the PC version of1-2-3 or with other spreadsheet products that use similar interfaces, theyshould feel quite at home with 1-2-3's interface.andP;  Users manipulate theirspreadsheets using nested menu options or 1-2-3 command keys.andP;  In addition,Lotus provides added flexibility by allowing users to program their ownfunction keys, which can then be used to perform tasks that the users havedefined.andM;Users invoke 1-2-3's top-level menu selections -- Worksheet, Range, Copy,Move, File, Print, Graph, Data, System and Quit -- using the forward &quot;slash&quot;(/) key (Fig.andP;  1).andM;A control panel occupies the top three lines of the 1-2-3 screen and providesdetails about menu options, file status, cell and address information, andthe current mode of operation.andP;  A file indicator and a status indicator, whenappropriate, are located at the bottom of the screen.andM;Status indicators appear on the screen during some 1-2-3 operations,including macro executions or zooms to specified 1-2-3 windows.andP;  Statusindicators also keep users informed of potential problems, such as a memoryshortage.andM;We were particularly appreciative of a rare but common-sense spreadsheetfeature: shaded sheet, row and column indicators that allowed us to determinethe current cell location without having to line up the cell contents withthe row and column headers.andM;Spreadsheet users who, in the past, have worked only in two dimensions willfind 1-2-3's three-dimensional perspective refreshing.andP;  All 1-2-3 operationscan be performed across the three dimensions.andM;Lotus 1-2-3's windowing capability allows it to represent the third dimensionas sheets within the worksheet file.andP;  In effect, these sheets are separateworksheets within the same file, akin to individual records in a database.andO;1-2-3 represents these sheets in a perspective mode, showing each sheet in aseparate window.andP;  A 1-2-3 file can hold as many as 256 sheets.andM;By default, 1-2-3 displays three sheets on a single screen when inperspective (3-D) mode.andP;  In order to increase the perspective (number ofwindows), users must include the /PERSPECTIVE=n qualifier when starting 1-2-3from the DCL prompt.andP;  Although users can specify from three to 26 windows, wediscovered that we were unable to display more than 10 windows at a time onour DEC VT320 terminal.andP;  Lotus doesn't provide a way to specify theperspective value from within 1-2-3, and some users may find this limitationinconvenient.andP;  For our testing, we chose a perspective value of five.andM;We designed a three-dimensional worksheet to maintain five-year balancesheets for several different companies.andP;  In this worksheet, separate cloumnswere used to represent each of the last five years, while asset and liabilitycategories were represented by rows.andP;  The third dimension, consisting ofindividual sheets, was used to represent the individual companies.andM;We invoked the 3-D perspective through the Worksheet option at the main menu.andO;From the Worksheet menu, we chose the Windows option, and subsequently chosethe Perspectives option.andP;  Our screen then displayed five sheets in ourworksheet file (Fig.andP;  2).andM;Lotus 1-2-3 files created with the VAX/VMS version of 1-2-3 are stored in aWK3 format and have WK3 extensions (for example, FILENAME.WK3).andP;  The latestPC version of 1-2-3 also uses the WK3 format, but files created with earlierPC versions of 1-2-3 were stored in a different format, denoted by WK1extensions.andP;  This doesn't present a problem for VAX/MVS users, because 1-2-3for VAX/VMS can read WK1 files.andM;Of course, a user will encounter compatibility problems when running 1-2-3macros that were created with a PC version of 1-2-3 if those macros includecommands or file-naming conventions that aren't used on the VAX, or if theycontain hardware-dependent commands that reference specific display devicesthat aren't available to the VAX/VMS user.andM;FILE MANAGEMENT ON THE MENUandM;Users initiate all 1-2-3 file management commands using the main menu's Fileoption.andP;  This option lets users retrieve and save worksheets, combineworksheet data stored in a file with current worksheet data, erase files fromdisk, and import or export text files.andM;To retrieve one of our existing worksheets, we used the File menu optionfollowed by the Retrieve option.andP;  1-2-3 then displayed all of the 1-2-3 filesin our current directory.andP;  By moving the cursor to the appropriate file andpressing the Return key, we were able to select the file we wanted.andM;Once the worksheet was retrieved into memory, we used other 1-2-3 menuoptions to manipulate data and worksheet settings.andP;  The Worksheet menuoptions allowed us to perform a wide range of operations on our spreadsheet.andO;We changed global settings to widen columns, define print devices, andsynchronize and unsynchronize window scrolling.andM;The Worksheet menu, accessed from the main menu, provides other usefulfeatures, including a Hide option and a global Worksheet Protection option.andO;The Hide option is useful for concealing confidential information.andP;  When thisfeature is enabled, the selected range within a worksheet is not displayed.andO;However, all functions and formulas remain valid.andM;Lotus 1-2-3's cursor movement keys let users navigate their worksheetsefficiently.andP;  The arrow keys move the cursor one cell at a time to the right,left, up or down.andP;  The Big Left and Big Right keys -- andless;PF1andgt; 4 and andless;PF1andgt; 6,respectively, on the LK201-style keyboard found on VT220- andVT320-compatible terminals -- move the cursor one full screen to the right orthe left.andP;  Similarly, the End, Home, Pgup and Goto keys mapped to theLK201-style keyboard allow users to jump quickly to different worksheetlocations.andM;We used the main menu's Range option to perform operations on selected two-and three-dimensional ranges of cells, invoking options under the Range menuto change the display format of a cell.andP;  Users have a choice of severalformats -- including general, fixed (fixed number of decimal places),exponential, currency, percent and date -- for representing numerical data,and can also format text (labels) using Range options.andM;The Range menu also lets users create range names to represent selectedchunks of data.andP;  For example, to select a range, we chose options from threelevels of menus.andP;  We first chose the Range option from the top-level menu andthen chose the Name option from the Range menu.andP;  Finally, we chose the Createoption from the Name menu, specified a name and selected the range of data tobe represented by the range name.andM;Range names are useful because they let spreadsheet users refer to apredefined range of cells by a mnemonic name rather than by cell addresses.andO;Other Range commands allowed us to search for strings and protect cell rangesfrom being modified.andM;Using the main menu's Copy and Move options, we were able to change theappearance and organization of our worksheet file.andP;  We moved or copiedselected data to different locations throughout our three-dimensionalworksheet.andM;Because 1-2-3 formulas can use either relative or absolute cell references,they are easy to copy and move.andP;  That is, when formulas that rely on relativecell references are moved to different spreadsheet locations, their cellreferences are updated automatically to reflect their new cell locations.andO;Formulas that contain absolute cell references, on the other hand, can bemoved without changing cell references.andP;  Of course, 1-2-3 can also handleformulas that contain both types of cell references.andM;We found the Data menu options to be useful for myriad data analysis andmanipulation tasks.andP;  1-2-3 offers a powerful regression command that acceptsas many as 75 independent variables.andP;  The Data menu options also allowspreadsheet users to create a frequency distribution of a specified range ofvalues.andM;With the Query option, spreadsheet users can select records from databasetables.andP;  These records can then be manipulated with several other 1-2-3commands.andP;  For instance, a range of data can be edited and then extracted toa designated output file Currently, 1-2-3 supports only external Rdb tables.andM;Users can select one Data menu option, Fill, to fill a range of cells with asequence of values.andP;  The Matrix option can be used to multiply atwo-dimensional matrix of values, and Sort can be used to sort records in adatabase table.andP;  The External option lets users exchange data between 1-2-3and external database tables.andM;Two methods are available for creating macro commands.andP;  We employed bothmethods to create macros for automating many of our repetitive tasks.andP;  First,we employed 1-2-3's macro programming language to create and save macros.andP;  Amore straightforward method allowed us to record keystrokes using 1-2-3'sRecord option.andP;  Our recorded keystrokes were saved to a file where we couldedit them, if necessary.andP;  Although both methods for creating macros do thejob, users who don't want to bother learning 1-2-3's macro programminglanguage will be quite content using Record.andM;The Graph menu, which is also accessed from the main menu, enabled us todisplay our data graphically on ReGIS graphics terminals and print it onReGIS and PostScript printers.andM;IT WORKS, BUT HOW FAST?andM;1-2-3 offers several graph types, including High-Low-Close-Open (HLCO), Line,Mixed, Pie, Stacked and XY.andP;  1-2-3 graphs can't be printed to sixel printerssuch as DEC's LN03 -- a serious limitation for many VAX users.andP;  However, anew software offering from DEC, the DECprint Utility for PostScript to SixelPrinting for VMS, allows users to print their PostScript files to sixelprinters.andM;Features don't tell the whole story when it comes to spreadsheets, so usersshould be wary of using features lists as the only criteria for makingpurchasing decisions.andP;  Performance can be just as important, particularly ifuse will be heavy.andP;  With this in mind, we designed several spreadsheet tasksto assess the CPU load imposed by 1-2-3.andM;We ran our series of performance tests on both a two- and a three-dimensionalworksheet.andP;  1-2-3 performed well on all the tests (Fig.andP;  3).andP;  As expected,however, adding a third dimension to a spreadsheet imposed an extraprocessing burden, as illustrated by the extra processing time required toretrieve a three-dimensional file.andM;Lotus 1-2-3 performs solidly and offers many appealing spreadsheet features.andO;It also provides a familiar user interface, offering comfort and ease of useto spreadsheet users emigrating from other platforms.andP;  However, we wouldencourage Lotus to add a journaling facility so that users can rest assuredthat valuable work won't be lost during a system crash.andM;An external file format interface would also be a plus: This version of 1-2-3for VAX/VMS doesn't include a mechanism for reading in files from othervendors' spreadsheet products.andM;Lotus 1-2-3 for VAX/VMS has what it takes to make it in the VAX marketplace,but as the new kid on the block it has to contend with several entrenched VAXspreadsheet products, including Access Technology's popular 20/20.andP;  But thelong-term outlook for 1-2-3 is good.andP;  Lotus has, at long last, taken a bigstep toward becoming a legitimate force in the VAX spreadsheet marketplace.andM;DR Labs tested version 1.0 of 1-2-3 for VAX/VMS on a MicroVAX 3100 runningVMS 5.3.andP;  The 1-2-3 software was installed on a Trimarchi DataKeg 600 disk.andM;Although price is always a consideration, the two criteria that are typicallyused to evaluate spreadsheet software are features and performance.andP;  Withthis in mind, we first examined 1-2-3's features, paying close attention toits three-dimensional spreadsheet, integrated graphics and external databaseinterface capabilities.andP;  We also looked at 1-2-3's compatibility with its PCcounterpart, since many sites have an interest in moving spreadsheet filesfrom PC environments to VAX environments without losing importantcapabilities or information.andM;We then looked at 1-2-3's performance.andP;  We designed a suite of tests thatmeasured the CPU time required to perform two- and three-dimensionaloperations.andM;For our two-dimensional spreadsheet tests, we created a spreadsheet thatmeasured 208 columns by 200 rows.andP;  We first measured the CPU time required toretrieve the file into 1-2-3 and then performed a series of operations:copying, deleting and then moving a 100-by-100 block of data.andP;  We theninserted 50 blank rows into the spreadsheet.andM;For the three-dimensional tests, we retrieved a file that measured 100columns by 100 rows by five sheets.andP;  We then proceeded to copy, delete andmove data blocks that measured three columns by 100 rows by five sheets.andP;  Weconcluded the three-dimensional testing by inserting 10 sheets into the workarea.andM;For our two final tests -- recalculations -- we used both a wide and a longfile.andP;  The wide file measured 256 columns by 10 rows and the long filemeasured 10 columns by 702 rows.andP;  Each cell in the wide file contained aformula that linked it to the preceding cell on the same row.andP;  Similarly, inthe long file, cells were linked vertically; that is, by column.andP;  The cellformulas also contained predefined multiplicative constants.andP;  Therecalculation tests involved changing the multiplicative constants and thenmeasuring the time required to recalculate each worksheet.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
