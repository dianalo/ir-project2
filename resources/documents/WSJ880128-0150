The FTC said it will seek a court order to halt the proposed $36.5 million purchase of U.S. Tobacco Co.'s dry snuff business by American Maize-Products Co. The transaction would substantially reduce competition in the $65 million industry, the FTC said.    A spokeswoman for Stamford, Conn.-based American Maize-Products said the proposed acquisition &quot;is in a holding pattern until Feb. 12,&quot; to give the company time to consider its options. A spokesman for U.S. Tobacco, a unit of Greenwich, Conn.-based UST Inc., said the company is &quot;studying the situation and studying our options,&quot; but declined to elaborate.    American Maize-Products' Helme Tobacco Co. unit has a 33% share of the market, while U.S. Tobacco has an 18% share, the FTC said.    American Maize-Products has interests in corn wet milling, tobacco and building materials. </TEXT></DOC>
