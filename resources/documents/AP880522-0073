After a year of layoffs and slowdowns, minicomputer makersclustered along the Route 128 beltway around Boston are refocusingtheir marketing and production tactics and forming businessalliances considered taboo a short time ago.   The main reason for the changes has been the advent of personalcomputers that can do some minicomputer jobs for a lot less money.   ``The focus of this business is PCs now,'' said John McCarthy ofForrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, which tracks technologymanagement trends. ``That's what's creating the excitement. It'snot mainframes and it's not minicomputers.''   Minicomputers _ which come as small as single-drawer filingcabinets but do not sit on desks _ are used for heavy computationin fields such as science and engineering, accounting, travel,inventory management and office automation.   In minicomputers, the central device is the brains of the systemwhile the terminals are ``dumb.'' With personal computers,``intelligence'' is located in each computer.   As processing capabilities of personal computers increase, priceis becoming a key factor separating minis and PCs. Today's standardprice range for minicomputers is $8,000 to $12,000 per user;desktop PCs cost from $4,000 to $8,000.   ``Minicomputer vendors don't understand how to achieve the sameprice levels as PCs, yet they have no performance advantage tooffer,'' said Aaron Goldberg, vice president for minicomputerservices at International Data Corp. ``Of course the customers areopting for the lower price alternative.''   IDC, a market researcher, forecasts a 17 percent growth in U.S.personal computer sales this year against 7 percent forminicomputers. Sales of minicomputers totaled $13.8 billion in 1987in the country, compared to $20.5 billion for personal computers.   Instead of buying one minicomputer, many companies are linkingtogether personal computers through local area networks and thenusing one common PC to store information, analysts said.   Under the most dire predictions, minicomputer use may berestricted to providing services for personal computer networks bythe mid-1990s.   The first minicomputer company, Digital Equipment Corp., wasfounded in 1957 in the corner of an old woolen mill. TheMaynard-based company grew into the world's second largest computermaker after International Business Machines Corp.   Other minicomputer makers that located in the high-tech corridoroutside Boston include Data General Corp. in Westboro, WangLaboratories Inc. in Lowell, Prime Computer Inc. in Natick andComputer Consoles Inc. in Waltham.   Business began to pick up in the early 1970s and surged through1985, when an industrywide slump hit and the personal computerbegan redefining the business.   One scenario is that businesses will rely on large mainframesfor large computing needs and personal computers for deskwork _leaving the mid-range minicomputers out in the cold. One industryanalyst forecast that about 65 percent of the market will opt forthe two-tiered approach.   ``The costs are staggering in terms of what this could do,''said Howard Anderson, managing director of the Yankee Group,``That's where the battle is going to be waged.''   Digital Equipment, challenging IBM on its own mainframe turf,has begun offering clusters of powerful minicomputers that add upto nearly the power of a big mainframe.   Minicomputer makers also are coming to grips with the emergenceof standard operating systems, which allow popular softwarepackages to be used on a variety of different computers.   The most popular standard operating system is American Telephoneandamp; Telegraph Co.'s Unix, a base layer of software in a computer thatserves as a traffic cop for its internal operations.   The threat to large computer vendors is simple: Unix frees usersfrom being tied to a single proprietary software limited to aparticular computer. On the other hand, Unix is good for smallcompanies that want to steal business away from the likes ofDigital and IBM.   For software makers, the move to Unix means the opportunity towrite programs applicable to many systems, and computer firmsalready have begun signing distribution packages with softwarehouses.   Wang Laboratories recently signed on to distribute software madeby Banyan Systems Inc. of Westboro which concentrates on personalcomputers. Analysts predict similiar alliances as companies seek tokeep a presence in accounts that aren't buying minicomputers.   Some minicomputer companies are falling back on market niches.Wang Labs is focusing on the storage and manipulation of documentimages. Prime, which recently bought neighboring ComputervisionCorp. for $435 million, is focusing on computer-aided design andmanufacturing.   Digital Equipment, too big to fit into a market niche, isstressing its skills in creating computer networks rather thanfocusing on the computers themselves.</TEXT></DOC>
