Technical assistance to the Committee is provided byOak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU). The present report is dividedinto four sections with two appendices, mentioned above. Section A isan introduction to there report and provides the specific charges fromCIRRPC to ORAU to conduct the study. Section B addresses how the federalradiation research agenda for FY85 met the research needs specified inthe 1981 Strategy Report. The last section of the report, Section D,offers the following recommendations with regard to future reports: (1)Within the next three years, a follow-up review should be made of theFederal radiation research program, including comparisons with the FY81and FY85 Federal radiation research agendas; (2) To facilitate subsequentreviews of the Federal radiation research programs, it is recommendedthat, to the extent it is practical, a compatible information retrievalsystem be established in each Federal agency; (3) A report of the Federalradiation research effort in high dose radiation effects should be carriedout since substantial Federal funding is used to support such researchand since many studies are applicable to both the high and low dose radiationresearch agendas. 2 figs., 23 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
