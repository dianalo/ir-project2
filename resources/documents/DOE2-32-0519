<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-32-0519 </DOCNO><TEXT>Fit of gluon self-coupling is made in QCD for three (n=3, 4, 5) momentsof gluon distribution in the region of Q/sup 2/ {similar_to} 50-1000GeV/sup 2/. The result depends strongly on the parametrization of theratio R(x, Q/sup 2/)={sigma}/sub L//{sigma}/sub T/ where {sigma}/subL/ and {sigma}/sub T/ are cross sections of the longitudinal and transversephoton scattering on a nucleon. The necessity is shown mainly of thelogarithmic (not power) violation of the Callan-Gross correlation. X-dependenceis also introduced into the parametrization of the ration R(x, Q/sup2/), which improves the result of the fit. 18 refs.; 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
