The stems grow 2 to 5 decimeterstall and are topped with an indefinite cyme of bright yellow actinomorphicflowers. Flowering occurs from June through September with fruiting fromAugust through October. The fruit is a hemispheric aggregate of hirsuteachenes, 7 to 9 millimeters in diameter (Kral 1983, Radford <T3>et al. </T3>1968, Massey <T3>et al. </T3>1980). This species can be easily distinguished from othersoutheastern <T3>Geums </T3>by its large yellow flowers and by its leaves (mostly basal)that have large terminal lobes and small laterals (Massey <T3>et al. </T3>1980). <T3>Geum radiatum </T3>has been placed in other genera by various workers;Robert Brown (1823) placed it in the genus <T3>Sieversia; </T3>Bolle (1933) placed it in the genus <T3>Acomastylis; </T3><T3>and</T3> Hara (1935) placed it in <T3>Parageum.</T3> Currently accepted taxonomic treatment places this speciesin the genus of Michaux's original description (Raynor 1952, Robertson1974).<T3>Hedyotis purpurea</T3> (L.) T. andamp; G. var. <T3>montana </T3>(Small) Fosberg was first described as <T3>Houstonia montana </T3>in 1903 by J. K. Small from specimens collectedby J. W. Chickering, Jr. in 1877 from the summit of Roan Mountain in NorthCarolina and Tennessee. Another synonym is <T3>Houstonia purpurea L. </T3>var. <T3>montana </T3>(Small) (Terrell 1959, Terrell 1978). This species isa shallow-rooted perennial that forms low-growing, loose tufts 1 to 1.5decimeters tall. The inflorescence is a subsessile few-flowered cyme. Thebright purple flowers appear in July and early August, followed by themany-seeded capsule (Kral 1983, Radford <T3>et al. </T3>1968). <T3>H. purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana </T3>is distinguished from <T3>H. p. </T3>var. <T3>purpurea </T3>by its larger corolla size, different corolla color (deeppurple as opposed to purplish to white in <T3>H. p. </T3>var. <T3>purpurea</T3>), and its larger seed size (Kral 1983, Terrell 1978).These two species are endemic to a few scattered mountaintops in westernNorth Carolina and eastern Tennessee where they grow, exposed to full sunlight,in the shallw acidic soils of high elevation cliffs, outcrops, steep slopes,and gravelly talus associated with cliffs. Substrate types are variablefor the species but include various igneous, metamorphic, and metasedimentaryrocks such as quartz diorite, garnet-rich biotite, muscovite and quartzschist, quartz phyllite, metagraywacke, metaconglomerate, and metarkosescontaining feldspar and chlorite, amphibole, hornblende, and feldspar gneiss(Massey <T3>et al. </T3>1980). Common associates of these two species include <T3>Leiophyllum buxifolium, Menziesia pilosa, Rhododendron catawbiense,Aster </T3>spp., <T3>Carex </T3>spp., <T3>Solidago </T3>spp., <T3>Heuchera villosa, Saxifraga michauxii, </T3>and various grass species.Some of the sites are also occupied by <T3>Liatris helleri </T3>and/or <T3>Solidago spithamaea, </T3>species that are already federally listedas threatened. The high elevation coniferous forests adjacent to the rockoutcrops and cliffs occupied by these two species are dominated by redspruce (<T3>Picea rubens</T3>) and another Federal candidate species, Fraser fir(<T3>Abies fraseri</T3>) (Massey <T3>et al.</T3> 1980, Morgan 1980, Kral 1983).Sixteen populations of <T3>Geum radiatum</T3> have been reported historically; 11 remain in existence.Three of these populations are in Ashe County, North Carolina, with onepopulation each remaining in Avery, Transylvania, Watauga, Buncombe, andYancey Counties, North Carolina, and Sevier County, Tennessee; the othertwo populations are located on the Mitchell County, North Carolina/CarterCounty, Tennessee line and the Avery/Watauga County line in North Carolina.Six of the remaining populations are located on privately owned lands;four are located on public land administered by the U.S. Forest Serviceand the National Park Service, and one is located on State park land administeredby the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Community Development.Five additional populations were historically known for this species. Thereasons for the disappearance of <T3>Geum radiatum</T3> at these sites are undocumented. However, most ofthese former sites have been subjected to heavy recreational use by hikers,climbers, and sightseers.<T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana</T3> was known historically from six populations; five remain.Two of these are located on the line between Avery and Watauga Counties,North Carolina; one is at the juncture of the boundaries of Mitchell andAvery Counties, North Carolina, and Carter County, Tennessee; and one populationeach remains in Ashe and Watauga Counties, North Carolina. The sixth populationwas reported from Yancey County, North Carolina, but has not been foundthere during recent searches (Paul Somers, personal communication, TennesseeDepartment of Conservation, 1988). That site, like those from which <T3>Geum radiatum</T3> has vanished, has also been subjected to relativelyheavy recreational use.The continued existence of both species is threatened by trampling andassociated soil erosion and compaction, other forms of habitat disturbancedue to heavy use of the habitat by recreationists such as hikers, as wellas by development for commercial recreational facilities and residentialpurposes. Since both species are early successional pioneers, some of thepopulations are also threatened by natural succession (Massey <T3>et al. </T3>1980, Kral 1983). Construction of new trails, other recreationalimprovements, significant increases in intensity of recreational use, orintensive development without regard to the welfare of these species atany of the sites could further jeopardize their continued existence.Most of the populations occupy a very small total area. Seven of the remaining<T3>Geum radiatum</T3> populations have fewer than 50 plants remainingin each, with 3 of these having fewer than 10 plants each. Over the pastdecade, at least four of the currently extant <T3>Geum radiatum</T3> populations have undergone significant populationdeclines (ranging from 67 percent to 96 percent); four others have suffereddeclines of lesser magnitude. Only three are known to have maintained relativestability during the same period. One of the privately owned sites forthese two species has been developed as a commercial recreation facility;development of a second site as a ski resort is currently underway. Thethird privately owned site is owned in part by The Nature Conservancy andis, therefore, partially protected. The remaining three sites in privateownership are unprotected, with residential development currently underwayat two of the sites. The five sites in public ownership are located inscenic areas that attract large numbers of visitors annually.Federal government actions on <T3>Geum radiatum</T3> began with section 12 of the Endangered SpeciesAct of 1973, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institutionto prepare a report on those plants considered to be endangered, threatened,or extinct. This report, designated as House Document No. 94-51, was presentedto Congress on January 9, 1975. The Service published a notice in the July1, 1975, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (40 FR 27832) of its acceptance of the reportof the Smithsonian Institution as a petition within the context of section4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3)) of the Act and of its intention thereby toreview the status of the plant taxa named within. <T3>Geum radiatum</T3> was included in the July 1, 1975, notice of review.On December 15, 1980, the Service published a revised notice of reviewfor native plants in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (45 FR 82480); <T3>Geum radiatum</T3> was included in that notice as a category 1 species;<T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana</T3> was included as a category 2 species. Category 1 speciesare those species for which the Service currently has on file substantialinformation on biological vulnerability and threats to support proposingto list them as endangered or threatened species. Category 2 species arethose for which listing as endangered or threatened may be warranted butfor which substantial data on biological vulnerability and threats is notcurrently known or on file to support proposed rules.On November 28, 1983, the Service published a supplement to the noticeof review for native plants in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (48 FR 53640); the plant notice was again revisedSeptember 27, 1985, (50 FR 39536). <T3>Geum radiatum</T3> was included as a category 2 species in both the1983 supplement and the 1985 revised notice. <T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana</T3> was included in the 1985 notice as a category 2 species.Subsequent to the 1985 notice, the Service received additional informationfrom the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program (A. Weakley, personalcommunication, 1988); this information and additional field data gatheredby the Heritage Program, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the NationalPark Service (Keith Langdon, personal communication, Great Smoky MountainsNational Park, 1988; Bambi Teague, personal communication, Blue Ridge Parkway,1988) indicate that the addition of <T3>Geum radiatum</T3> and <T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana</T3> to the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Plantsis warranted.Section 4(b)(B) of the Endangered Species Act, as amended in 1982, requiresthe Secretary to make certain findings on pending petitions within 12 monthsof their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requiresthat all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having beennewly submitted on that date. This was the case for <T3>Geum radiatum </T3>because of the acceptance of the 1975 SmithsonianReport as a petition. In October of 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988,the Service found that the petitioned listing of <T3>Geum radiatum </T3>was warranted but precluded by listing actions ofa higher priority and that additional data on vulnerability and threatswere still being gathered. Publication of this proposal constitutes thefinal finding that is required. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species </ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq</T3>.) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding speciesto the Federal list. A species may be determined to be an endangered orthreatened species due to one or more of the five factors described insection 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to <T3>Geum radiatum </T3>Michaux (spreading avens) and <T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana </T3>(Chickering) Fosberg (Roan Mountain bluet) are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range. </T3><T3>Geum radiatum </T3>and <T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana </T3>are restricted to a few mountaintops and cliff faces inthe souther Appalachians of western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee(see ``Background'' section for specific distributions). Although populationsare declining and vanishing for reasons that are, in many cases, not clearlyunderstood, destruction and adverse modification of their habitat posea major threat to the remaining populations of both species. Thirty-onepercent of the historically known <T3>Geum radiatum </T3>populations have been extirpated, along with 17percent of the <T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana </T3>populations. Only 11 populations of the <T3>Geum </T3>and 5 of the <T3>Hedyotis </T3>remain. The five remaining <T3>Hedyotis </T3>populations are small and vulnerable, with two occupyinga total of less than 10 square meters. Two of these populations occupysites that have been or are being developed for commercial recreation.A third site, located on land administered by the U.S. Forest Service,contains 41 percent of the remaining individuals of this species and issubjected to heavy and increasingly intense recreational use. The othertwo populations are located on private land and are completely unprotected.As detailed in the <T4>Background </T4>section, significant declines have been documentedin many of the extant <T3>Geum </T3>populations during the past decade. Five of the remaining11 <T3>Geum </T3>populations are located on public lands where they are subjectedto heavy recreational use. One of these sites, owned by the U.S. ForestService, currently supports 73 percent of the remaining individuals ofthis species; recreational pressure on this already heavily used site issteadily increasing. Of the six privately owned sites, one has been developedas a commercial recreation facility, which attracts several hundred thousandvisitors annually. A second site is currently being developed as a skiresort; the other four privately owned sites are currently unprotectedand located in an area that is rapidly developing as a center for resortsand tourism. The greatest damage to <T3>Geum radiatum </T3>and <T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana </T3>in the past has probably come from the commercial developmentof the open mountain summits where they occur. The construction of trails,parking lots, roads, buildings, observation platforms, suspension bridges,and other recreational, residential, and commercial facilities has takenits toll on the species either through the actual construction processor by trampling due to hikers and sightseers (Kral 1983). Currently, heavytrampling occurs at six of the locations where these two species are knownto survive; however, all of the small habitats occupied by these speciesare threatened by increase in intensity of use, particulary if additionaldevelopment occurs (Massey <T3>et al. </T3>1980).With anticipated increased usage by sightseers, rock climbers, and hikersat 8 of the remaining 11 localities where <T3>Geum radiatum </T3>occurs, and at 4 of the 5 remaining <T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana </T3>localities, significant impacts on these species in theform of increased soil erosion, soil compaction, and trampling could occurif protection is not provided. Likewise, additional development at anyof the locales (such as expansion of trails or sidewalks, constructionof additional visitor facilities, or residential development) could furtherthreaten the species if proper planning does not occur. B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes. </T3>Neither <T3>Geum radiatum </T3>nor <T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana </T3>is currently a significant component of the commercialtrade in native plants; however, both have attractive growth habits andshowy flowers and have potential for horticultural use. Some collectingfrom wild populations of <T3>Geum </T3>is already occuring. Publicity could generate an increaseddemand and intensify collecting pressure on wild populations of both species.C. <T3>Disease or predation. </T3>These taxa are not known to be threatenedby disease or predation. D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. Geum radiatum </T3>and<T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana </T3>are afforded legal protection in North Carolina by NorthCarolina General Statute, Chapter 106, Article 19-B, 202.12-102.19, thatprohibits intrastate trade and taking of State-listed plants without aState permit and written permission of the landowner. <T3>Geum radiatum </T3>is listed in North Carolina as threatened_specialconcern (currently proposed as endangered_special concern); <T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana </T3>is currently being added to the State's list as endangered.In Tennessee, State-listed plants are afforded legal protection by theRare Plant Protection and Conservation Act of 1985, Tennessee Code Ann.,Chapter 242, Section 11-26-201 to 11-26-214, Public Acts of 1985. Thisstatute prohibits taking of listed species without permission of the landowneror manager and regulates commercial sale and export. <T3>Geum radiatum </T3>is listed as endangered in Tennessee. State prohibitionsagainst taking are difficult to enforce and do not cover adverse alterationsof habitat or unintentional damage from recreational use. The EndangeredSpecies Act will provide additional protection and encouragement of activemanagement for <T3>Geum radiatum </T3>and <T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana, </T3>particularly on Federal lands. E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>These taxa are rare and vulnerable due to their specialized habitatrequirements and the limited amount of potential habitat. As mentionedin the previous sections of this proposed rule, most of the remaining populationsare small in numbers of individuals and in terms of area covered by theplants. Therefore, little genetic varibility exists in these species, makingit more important to maintain as much habitat and as many of the remainingcolonies as possible. <T3>Geum radiatum </T3>and <T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana </T3>are early pioneer species growing on rock ledges in fullsun. Depending upon the elevation and suitability of the site for supportingwoody vegetation, invasion by shrubs and trees can occur, eliminating thesespecies by overcrowding and shading. Since this type of succession is aslow process, this is not considered an immediate threat to survival ofthe species. However, proper management planning for <T3>Geum radiatum </T3>and <T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana </T3>is needed to address this aspect of the species' biology.Natural rock slides, severe storms or droughts, or other natural eventsmay also eliminate populations of these plants. In recent years the spruce fir forests adjacent to the cliffs and rockoutcrops occupied by these species have suffered dramatic declines due,at least in part, to airborne pollution and the impacts of an exotic insect,the balsam wooly aphid. The impacts of this forest decline on these tworare herbaceous species cannot be accurately assessed at this time. Eventhough both species are pioneers and require exposure to full sunlight,the drastic decline in the high elevation forests may result in excessivedesiccation of the moist sites occupied by the <T3>Geum </T3>and <T3>Hedyotis. </T3>This theory would seem to be supported by the fact thatpopulations of the <T3>Geum, </T3>particularly those located on drier sites, usually abortthe fruiting stems before seed can be set. The rhizomes of these perennialsare believed to be capable of surviving for decades. (Prince and Morse1985), but continued failure in seed production poses a definite threatto long-term survival and recovery of the species. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thesespecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list <T3>Geum radiatum </T3>and <T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana </T3>as endangered. With 31 percent of <T3>Geum </T3>and 17 percent of <T3>Hedyotis </T3>populations having already been extirpated, and onlyeleven populations of <T3>Geum </T3>and five of <T3>Hedyotis </T3>remaining (all of which are subject to some form of threat),these species warrant protection under the Act. With the small number ofremaining populations and the small number of individuals and area coveredby these populations, and with significant declines having been documentedin many of the surviving populations, these two plants are in danger ofextinction throughout all or significant portions of their ranges and,therefore, qualify as endangered species under the Act. Critical habitatis not being designated for the reasons discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary propose critical habitat at thetime the species is proposed to be endangered or threatend. The Servicefinds that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent foreither <T3>Geum radiatum </T3>or <T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana </T3>at this time. Publication of critical habitat descriptionsand maps would increase public interest and possibly lead to additionalthreats for these species from collecting and vandalism (see threat factor``B'' above). Both species have showy flowers and have some potential forhorticultural use. Increased publicity and a provision of specific locationinformation associated with critical habitat designation could result inincreased collecting from wild populations since neither is readily availablefrom cultivated sources. Although taking of endangered plants from landsunder Federal jurisdiction (and from privately owned lands under certaincircumstances_see ``Available Conservation Measures'' section) and reductionto possession is prohibited by the Endangered Species Act, taking provisionsare difficult to enforce. Publication of critical habitat descriptionswould make <T3>Geum radiatum </T3>and <T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana </T3>more vulnerable and would increase enforcement problemsfor the U.S. Forest Service and the National Park Service. Also, the populationson private lands would be more vulnerable to taking. Increased visits topopulation locations stimulated by critical habitat designation, even withoutcollection of plants, could adversely affect the species due to the associatedincrease in trampling of the fragile habitat occupied by these plants.The Federal and State agencies and landowners involved in managing thehabitat of these species have been informed of the plants' locations andof the importance of protection; therefore, it would not be prudent andno additional benefit would result from a determination of critical habitat.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against takingare discussed in part below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed criticalhabitat. If a species is subsequently listed, section 7(a)(2) requiresFederal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a speciesor to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federalagency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.The U.S. Forest Service and the National Park Service have jurisdictionover portions of the species' habitat. Federal activities that could impact<T3>Geum radiatum</T3> and <T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana </T3>and their habitat in the future include, but are not limitedto, the following: Construction of recreational facilities (including trails,buildings, or maintenance of these facilities), use of aerially appliedretardants in fire fighting efforts, road construction, permits for mineralexploration, and any other activities that do not include planning forthe species' continued existence. The Service will work with the involvedagencies to secure protection and proper management of <T3>Geum radiatum</T3> and <T3>Hedyotis purpurea </T3>var. <T3>montana</T3> while accommodating agency activities to the extent possible.The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62,and 17.63 set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptionsthat apply to all endangered plants. All trade prohibitions at section9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61 would apply. These prohibitions,in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction ofthe United States to import or export any endangered plant, transport itin interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial activity,sell or offer it for sale in interstate or foreign commerce, or removeit from areas under Federal jurisdiction and reduce it to possession. Inaddition, the 1988 amendments (Pub. L. 100-478) to the Act protect listedplants from malicious damage or destruction on Federal lands and theirremoval, cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying in knowing violationof any State law or regulation, including State criminal trespass law.Certain exceptions can apply to agents of the Service and State conservationagencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuanceof permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangeredspecies under certain circumstances. It is anticipated that few trade permitswould ever be sought or issued since <T3>Geum radiatum </T3>and <T3>Hedyotis purpurea</T3> var. <T3>montana </T3>are not common in cultivation or in the wild. Requestsfor copies of the regulations on plants and inquiries regarding them maybe addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and WildlifeService, P.O. Box 3507, Arlington, VA 22203-3507 (703/358-2104).<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited</ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningany aspect of this proposed rule are hereby solicited.

Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date of theproposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to the FieldSupervisor, Asheville Field Office (see <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> section).<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.
