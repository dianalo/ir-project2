The drop in the Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators, which followed a revised 0.2% rise in October, is consistent with widespread predictions that economic growth is likely to slow in coming months. &quot;It does indicate that the economy is going to lose some of its momentum in the first half of the year,&quot; said Richard Peterson, senior vice president at Continental Illinois National Bank in Chicago.    Separately, the department said sales of single-family homes fell 1.2% in November after a revised 2.1% gain in October. Several economists said the report suggests that the drop in mortgage rates since the Oct. 19 stock market crash is helping offset whatever damage the decline in stock prices has done to the housing sector. They cautioned, however, against reading too much into these relatively small changes in this frequently erratic series.    The drop in the index of leading indicators was the biggest since July 1984, when it also fell 1.7%, and it was the first since January's 0.7% decline. The department said stock prices accounted for about two-thirds of the November decline. Changes in stock prices are calculated by taking the average of daily closing values for the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index during the month, compared with the previous month.    Many analysts took greater note of the decline's broad base. &quot;The biggest factor was stock prices, but the fact that most of the other elements went down does suggest some weakening ahead of us in the rate of economic growth,&quot; said Lyle Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association.    He and other economists, however, said the report doesn't suggest a recession is imminent. Economists generally believe the index doesn't foretell a recession unless it declines for three consecutive months.    Besides the stock market decline, indicators that contributed to last month's drop in the index included the number of companies receiving slower deliveries from suppliers, unemployment claims, and orders for plant and equipment.    Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner said there has been little indication that the stock market decline has directly affected the economy, but he said growth may slow as a result of a buildup of inventories in the current quarter that would have to be worked off in the first half of next year.    The November drop brought the index to 190.2% of its 1967 average from 193.5% in October. The October rise was initially reported as a 0.2% drop. In yesterday's release, the department also revised the September performance to a 0.2% rise, after previously reporting it as unchanged.    The index of coincident indicators, which is designed to measure the current condition of the economy, fell 0.2% last month to 171.5% of its 1967 average, after increasing 1.2% to 171.9% in October. The index of lagging indicators, which tends to trail economic trends, declined 0.2% to 142.4% of the 1967 average, after rising 0.1% to 142.7%.    The department initially reported that October home sales dropped 1.5%. The November decline brought sales to an annual rate of 664,000 units from 672,000 in October. The November pace was 3.9% below that of November 1986.    Sales fell in every region of the country except the Northeast, where they rose sharply. David Berson, senior economist at the Federal National Mortgage Association, said the strong sales in the Northeast, where houses tend to be more expensive than in the rest of the country, accounted for a big increase in home prices last month.    The department said the average price rose 13.2% to $140,300 from $123,900 in October. The median price increased 12.3% to $119,000 from $106,000.    The figures in both reports are adjusted for seasonal variation. Before adjustment, an estimated 47,000 houses were sold in November, down from 53,000 in October.    Here are the net contributions of the components of the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators. After various adjustments, they produced a 1.7% decline in the index for November and a 0.2% rise for October.                                         Nov.
