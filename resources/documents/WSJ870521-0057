Oil prices climbed in recent weeks, in part because of expectations that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would boost its fixed-price formula at the June meeting, traders and analysts said.    The statement issued by the Gulf Cooperation Council -- which consists of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain -- helped dash speculation among traders that OPEC would raise its current benchmark price of about $18, analysts said.    In a communique released to the Saudi Press Agency, the oil ministers said they agreed to adhere to the $18 benchmark &quot;because of the paramount importance of this in maintaining market stability.&quot;    The statement &quot;brought the market back to reality a bit,&quot; said John Hill, head of energy research at Merrill Lynch Futures Inc. in New York.    Prices were under other pressure as well, some analysts noted. The June crude oil contract, which briefly touched $20 a barrel Tuesday, expired and was replaced by the July contract, which was trading at significantly lower levels.    At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for July delivery fell 29 cents a barrel to $19.03. July heating oil slipped 0.63 cent a gallon to 50.94 cents, and July unleaded gasoline skidded 0.77 cent a gallon lower to 54.10 cents.    There were losses in the spot, or non-contract, market as well. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, fell 15 cents a barrel to $19.70, and the June price of North Sea Brent, the widely traded European blend, fell 25 cents to $18.60.    Some analysts said the Gulf Cooperation Council stance had little market impact, as did a similar statement Tuesday by Saudi King Fahd calling for stability in world oil markets. Traders are focusing on the large supplies of gasoline in the market, the analysts said.    Despite a moderate decline in weekly U.S. gasoline inventories, reported by the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday, there is a revival of concern &quot;that there may simply be too much gasoline on our hands,&quot; said James Ritterbusch, vice president, energy futures, at PaineWebber Inc. in Chicago.    Gasoline supplies are running at about 26.6 million barrels, or 12.7%, above levels a year ago, and inventories aren't dropping very fast at a time &quot;when refinery activity is edging back up again&quot;, Mr. Ritterbusch said. A barrel is equal to 42 gallons.    Still, several analysts and traders expect higher prices in the coming weeks. &quot;This doesn't signal we've seen a top to the market,&quot; said a Chicago-based trader.    At least two oil companies, reflecting such optimism, raised the price they pay for West Texas Intermediate crude oil. Sun Co. and Koch Oil Co. said they raised their posted prices 50 cents to $18.50 a barrel.    In other futures markets yesterday:    PRECIOUS METALS: Prices fell as the Treasury bond market firmed slightly and oil prices declined. At the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for June delivery fell $5 an ounce to $473.30, and May silver slipped 21.2 cents an ounce to $9.124. At the New York Merc, July platinum fell $3.40 an ounce to $624.60. However, the precious metals sell-off is likely to be short-lived, several analysts and traders said. &quot;This doesn't portend the end of the rally,&quot; a New York analyst said. &quot;It's been a very orderly, healthy consolidation.&quot;    COTTON: The boom in prices, which have more than doubled since July, continued in active trading. Heavy demand and concern about inflation pushed prices higher, analysts said. At the New York Cotton Exchange, the July contract rose 1.01 cents a pound to 71.45 cents. The December contract, which reflects the harvest that starts Aug. 1, hit a life-of-contract high of 70.45 cents before settling at 70.30 cents, a gain of 0.93 cent for the day. Strong technical and fundamental factors &quot;are combining to push cotton prices higher,&quot; said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. &quot;Foreign mills are buying cotton because with the cheap dollar they are making great profits,&quot; said Mr. Simon. &quot;In the U.S., people are buying cotton and are switching away from cotton/polyester blends and from polyester itself,&quot; he said. &quot;U.S. mills are also buying cotton because, with the lower dollar, they can export textiles more cheaply,&quot; he said.    INTEREST RATES: Although Treasury bond futures prices slumped almost another half point, they may be poised for at least a short-term rally, said Joseph Belanoff, head of taxable fixed income trading at Moseley Securities Co. in New York. &quot;There's a lot of bad news already in these prices,&quot; he said. &quot;The fundamentals are telling you prices could snap back to higher levels.&quot; Traders said prices gained ground momentarily at midday when the Federal Reserve Board drained reserves from the banking system, apparently in an effort to raise short-term interest rates and damp inflation fears. However, &quot;the longs were afraid to go home long,&quot; or owning contracts, in light of the wide price swings of recent weeks, and they tended to sell futures contracts before the close to even out their positions, Mr. Belanoff said. </TEXT></DOC>
