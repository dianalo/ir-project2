A study of 3,623 elderly people in Boston indicates one in 10 ofthem probably had Alzheimer's disease, which robs people of theirmemories and their ability to function, researchers said.   The rates of Alzheimer's grew rapidly higher with advancing age,as nearly half of those older than 85 suffer from it, said theresearchers, led by Dr. Denis A. Evans of Harvard Medical School.   Based on the study's results, the National Institute on Agingrevised its estimate of how many people in the United States sufferfrom Alzheimer's from 2.5 million to 4 million.   The institute issued a statement saying the study is uniquebecause it involved large numbers of people, including those livingin their own homes or with their families, and it included peoplewith few or no memory problems.   ``As a result, these estimates might lay the groundwork fordeveloping the most accurate picture of Alzheimer's disease in theU.S. population to date,'' said Dr. Zaven Khachaturian, NIAassociate director for neuroscience and neuropsychology of aging.   Results of the study, partly financed by NIA, were published intoday's Journal of the American Medical Association.   ``People that I see do not realize that this is an extremelyprevalent condition, that it is an epidemic that is going to weighheavily on our future,'' said Dr. Bruce Naughton, geriatrics chiefat Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago.   The U.S. Census Bureau has estimated that from 1980 to the year2000, the number of people 90 years old and up will increase 236percent, to 1.9 million, Naughton said.   The Harvard study consisted of giving brief memory tests to 81percent of the 65-and-older population of east Boston beginning in1982, and conducting more extensive psychiatric and laboratorytesting on 467 of the individuals.   Of people 65 to 74 years old, 3 percent had ``probable''Alzheimer's disease, compared with 18.7 percent of those 75 to 84years old and 47.2 percent of those over 85, said the study.   ``Everyone in our study, whether they had Alzheimer's disease ornot, was living in the community, not in institutions,'' Evansnoted in a telephone interview. ``They may have had impairedfunction, far from perfect function, but they were able to live inthe community.''   Victims of Alzheimer's disease often end up in nursing homes,but Evans called for finding ways to allow Alzheimer's sufferers tostay in the community with their families.   Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative illness of the brain andnervous system with no known cause, no cure and no effectivetreatment, save medication to treat the depression that sometimesaccompanies it.   The disease usually is fatal within 5 to 10 years, according toNaughton, who said its first symptom is typically memory loss,followed by speech difficulties and a tendency to lose one's wayeven in familiar surroundings.   Alzheimer's later robs people of their ability to cook and carefor themselves, as well as exaggerating their personality traits _such as hot-temperedness or passivity. The illness eventuallyconfines victims to bed and renders them unable to respond to theirenvironment, Naughton said.   The Harvard study ``points out the need for further research,because the problem is greater than formerly recognized,'' saidCreighton Phelps, vice president of medical and scientific affairsfor the Chicago-based Alzheimer's Association, a research andfamily-support group.   Naughton said Alzheimer's research is relatively well fundedcompared with financial support for training physicians to care forAlzheimer's victims.   ``We're very poorly prepared in the medical profession to dealwith chronic care,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
