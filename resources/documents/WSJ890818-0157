The London-based tobacco, retailing and financial services conglomerate is expected to release on Monday or Tuesday a largely traditional British defense strategy to combat the all-paper, highly leveraged bid from Sir James's Hoylake Investments Ltd., an investor group. Hoylake, whose backers include financiers Jacob Rothschild and Kerry Packer and former U.S. Treasury Secretary William Simon, wants to sell all of B.A.T's businesses except tobacco. Proceeds would be used to pay more than #10 billion in debt needed to finance the transaction, Europe's biggest takeover bid.    People familiar with B.A.T say the company's plan is to defend B.A.T's performance while assailing Sir James for &quot;glib&quot; mischaracterizations of B.A.T's record. B.A.T also will go on the offensive, attacking the structure of Hoylake's offer by claiming Sir James and his backers could wind up with a windfall of hundreds of millions of pounds if the bid succeeds.    Specifically, the defense document is expected to say B.A.T has outperformed some of the largest British companies in generating total returns for shareholders over the past six years, and that a criticized diversification into retailing is turning around. B.A.T will say its 33.06% total annual compound return to shareholders -- share-price growth plus gross dividends reinvested -- led 10 of the largest British companies, including conglomerates and single-industry companies over the period. According to B.A.T, its performance compares with a 32.05% return for Hanson PLC, 22.6% for British Petroleum Co. and 3.1% for General Electric Co. of Britain, a Hoylake backer.    As things stand, Sir James faces much skepticism about his bid. Investors want to see a sweetened, largely cash offer, and Sir James seems mired in U.S. regulatory disputes about B.A.T's Farmers Group Inc. unit that could effectively scuttle his effort.    But B.A.T could face longer-term uncertainty even if Sir James's bid fails. The Anglo-French financier appears to have struck a sympathetic chord among some institutional shareholders with his arguments that B.A.T's value would be increased by &quot;unbundling&quot; its assets. Sir James appears to have ensured that B.A.T's institutional holders will put pressure on the company to propose ideas that could bolster shareholder value.    &quot;We hope B.A.T will come up with an imaginative defense,&quot; says Stewart Gilchrist of Glasgow-based Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, which holds just under 1% of B.A.T. &quot;It might be a Pyrrhic victory to (defeat) this bid and be left with a dissatisfied shareholder base, which could make (B.A.T) vulnerable&quot; to other subsequent bids.    Several large B.A.T holders say they have held informal conversations recently among themselves about recapitalization proposals and other mechanisms to unlock B.A.T asset values and lock in recent share-price gains. Such plans could include accelerated sales of underperforming assets and higher payouts to shareholders. Some institutions also have been in contact with B.A.T about its defense.    Among the institutions believed to be interested in exploring asset-enhancing proposals are Britain's Legal andamp; General, Postel Investment Management and Prudential Assurance Co., according to people familiar with the bid. Officials at those institutions declined to comment.    Gavin Gemmell, a partner of Baillie Gifford andamp; Co., an Edinburgh, Scotland-based holder, says B.A.T needs to demonstrate &quot;a willingness to dispose of businesses which have not been earning a decent return.&quot; Adds another senior fund manager: &quot;The signal (B.A.T) will be getting from most big shareholders is you need to do something&quot; to increase shareholder value. &quot;Most shareholders don't want to see Hoylake successful, but if B.A.T doesn't do anything&quot; it will be vulnerable to a breakup either through an improved Hoylake offer or another counterbidder, he adds.    One plan is for B.A.T to recapitalize by offering shares in four major operating divisions. At least one British merchant bank, Baring Brothers andamp; Co., is said to be discussing such a plan.    People close to B.A.T say the company wants to &quot;leave the door open&quot; to such proposals, without yet showing what it may have in mind. Some investors also expect the group to move forward its first-half earnings announcement, now due Sept. 6.    Scottish Amicable's Mr. Gilchrist suspects B.A.T &quot;will have something up its sleeve&quot; along the lines of earnings projections and dividend forecasts that would underpin B.A.T's share price at the 650 pence ($10.28) to 700 pence ($11.07) level even if the Hoylake offer is defeated. B.A.T shares were trading below 600 pence as recently as four months ago. Sir James says his bid currently values B.A.T at about 878 pence a share. In London trading yesterday, B.A.T shares fell six pence, to 817 pence. </TEXT></DOC>
