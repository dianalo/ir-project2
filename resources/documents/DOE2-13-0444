Jetson both galactic and stellar scales are contrasted, and a common geometricalmodel for these phenomena is presented. After the presentation of a numberof currently puzzling problems, a two-year research program is outlined,whose aim is to further understand the acceleration of material to relativisticvelocities in nature on various scales.</TEXT></DOC>
