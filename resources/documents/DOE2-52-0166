The spectral peak of the Raman-shiftedlight varies linearly with the intensity of the pump light and is givenby {sigma}(rho,I) = {sigma}(rho) + AI. The previously measured density-dependentStokes shift is {sigma}(rho), the intensity of the laser is I, and Ais 1.5 +- 0.2 cm/sup -1//(TW/cm{sup 2}). The electric field-induced shiftand asymmetric line shape limit the accuracy and resolution of spectroscopicmeasurements made with light from a hydrogen Raman shifter. We proposethat these observations may be explained by the ac Stark effect in theRaman shifting medium.</TEXT></DOC>
