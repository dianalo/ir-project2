The Frankfurt trial of Mohammed Ali Hamadi is expected to beginJuly 5 and continue at least two months, said spokesman Falk Thomas.   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13, 1987,carrying liquid explosives and false documents. He was charged Feb.8.   The air piracy and murder charges are in connection with theJune 14, 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner to Beirut, Lebanon, inwhich U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed. The hijackers held39 Americans captive for 17 days.   Hamadi was indicted in the United States on air piracy andmurder charges but West Germany refused to extradite him.   Hamadi will be tried before a juvenile chamber of the Frankfurtstate court, although he could be treated as an adult and receivethe maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted.   The court will first try to determine if Hamadi was under 21years old during the hijacking. He first told investigators he wasborn June 13, 1964, but later said he was two years younger.   Under West German law, juvenile courts can handle cases ofdefendents under 21.   A juvenile court can impose a life sentence on an adolescentdespite the age.   Hamadi's brother, Abbas, was found guilty by a Duesseldorf courtlast month of organizing the kidnapping of two West Germans inLebanon to force the West German government to release his brother.Abbas Hamadi was sentenced to 13 years in prison.   The two West Germans were abducted within a week of MohammedHamadi's arrest. Alfred Schmidt was released in September. RudolfCordes remains a hostage.</TEXT></DOC>
