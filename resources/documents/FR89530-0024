L. No. 99-570, section 1803, and Executive Order 12600, as well asfinal revisions to the Department of Labor procedural regulations whichimplement the Freedom of Information Act. The Freedom of Information ReformAct of 1986 requires each agency to promulgate regulations specifying theschedule of fees applicable to the processing of requests, and establishingguidelines for determining when such fees should be waived or reduced.Executive Order 12600 requires agencies to establish procedures for notifyingsubmitters of commercial information when the agency determines that itmay be required to disclose the information under FOIA. The revisions toexisting Department of Labor regulations implementing the Freedom of InformationAct are intended to, among other things, simplify the Department's regulationsand to clarify the description of its procedures for access to recordsunder FOIA.This document also adds a provision for the assessment of mailing costs.A provision similar to the one set forth below was contained in the Department'sexisting regulations but was inadvertently omitted from the proposal publishedon February 23, 1988 (53 FR 5346). Therefore, it is being incorporatedin the final rule at this time. Section 70.20(d)(2) has also been modifiedin the final rule to permit charging requesters for not only the directcosts of computer tapes, but also for other types of tapes as well wheninformation is made available in that form.

Public comment on the proposed regulation wasinvited, with the comment period extending to July 18, 1988.As published, the proposed rule inadvertently omitted a provision pertainingto mailing costs. A provision addressing that subject, fashioned afteran existing Labor Department regulation, is being added as andSection; 70.40(d)(4).In addition, andSection; 70.20(d)(2) has been modified in the final ruleto permit charging of requesters for not only the direct costs of computertapes, but also for other types of tape as well when information is madeavailable in that form. These provisions are being adopted without publiccomment. The Department has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B),that good cause exists for waiving advanced public comment because theseprovisions will result in minimal impact on the public and should be uncontroversial.Nevertheless, the Department is interested in any comments the public mighthave regarding these matters. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments Received</ITAG>A total of three comments were postmarked or received within the commentperiod. Comments were received from the following:<ITAG tagnum="15">Equal Employment Advisory Council </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Public Citizen Litigation Group </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press</ITAG>The comments are addressed below sequentially according to the specificsubsections of the regulation to which they apply. Before addressing thespecific comments, it should be pointed out that the proposed rules havebeen renumbered in the final version in order to make room for amendmentsin the future.

Treat All Records Which Can Be Produced By a Computer as Subject to FOIA(andSection; 70.5) Two commenters objected to proposed rule andSection; 70.5 which providesthat the agency is not required to create a computer program in order torespond to a request for records. Those commenters maintain that an agencyis required under FOIA to create a computer program to retrieve informationwhich cannot be retrieved with an agency's existing computer capabilities.This, in the agency's view, is tantamount to requiring the creation ofan agency record which under <T3>NLRB </T3>v. <T3>Sears Roebuck and Co</T3>., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), an agency is not requiredto do. For this reason, section 70.5 is being adopted as proposed. Changesof a similar nature were suggested to andSection; 70.38(d) and andSection;70.40(c)(4). For the same reasons, these suggestions have not been adopted.Provide Submitters of Business Information With Hearing in Connection WithOpportunity To Object to Disclosure One commenter suggested that submitters of business information be affordeda hearing in connection with determinations regarding whether businessinformation should be disclosed or afforded Exemption 4 protection. Theproposed rule was fashioned after the requirements of Executive Order 12600.That Executive Order contains no requirement to give submitters of businessinformation a hearing. Moreover, as submitters of business informationthemselves will in most instances be the only persons furnishing the agencywith information on the question of whether disclosure is appropriate,cross-examination would appear to be of little, if any, utility. Statedanother way, the agency is of the view that it can acquire all the informationnecessary to issue a proper determination on the disclosability of businessinformation through written submissions. The suggestion, therefore, wasnot adopted and the final rule is being promulgated as proposed. Require Determination on Business Submitter Information Be Made Within10 Days of Receipt of Request (andSection; 70.26(c)) One commenter suggested that andSection; 70.26(c) be modified to includea requirement that determinations on business submitter information bemade within 10 days. The rule, as proposed, provides submitters of businessinformation with a ``reasonable period of time'' within which to submittheir objections, if any, to disclosure. Were the agency to require submittersto furnish their objections within a time- frame that would enable theagency to make its determination within 10 days, many, if not all, agencydeterminations would be subject to the criticism that they did not providean adequate oportunity to object to disclosure. Accordingly, in order toinsure that the rights of submitters of business information are adequatleyprotected, the suggestion has not been accepted. Provide Exemption 4 Protection to all Submissions Made Objecting to Disclosure(andSection; 70.26(e)) One commenter suggested that all submissions made by a business establishmentfor the purpose of objecting to a disclosure request automatically be affordedExemption 4 protection. The commenter's rationale was that informationsubmitted by an establishment provides a relatively specific formula ofhow the information at issue can be used for competitive harm. The rule,as proposed, provides that such materials may be subject to disclosureunder FOIA. The agency recognizes that in objecting to the disclosure ofpurported confidential business information, an establishment might haveto submit additional confidential business information in order to explainhow disclosure of the former would cause substantial competitive harm.However, that is not likely to always be the case. In fact, based uponthis agency's prior experience with questions of this nature, there willprobably be a significant number of instances when it will not be the case.Therefore, it would be both imprudent and unlawful to afford the protectionsuggested. Instead, the agency has retained the language contained in theproposal and will decide these matters on a case-by-case basis. Exclude From Definition of ``Commercial Use Request'' Requests by PublicInterest Groups, Labor Unions, Libraries and the News Media (andSection;70.38(f))One commenter suggested that the definition of the term ``commercial userequest'' be revised to exclude all requests from public interest groups,labor unions, libraries and the news media. The merits of this suggestionwere reviewed. It was concluded that it would be inappropriate to automaticallyexclude all requests from the foregoing entities from the definition of``commercial use request'' in every instance. Instead, it was consideredmore prudent to evaluate this question on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly,the proposed definition has been retained in the final rule.Modify Definition of Educational Institution (andSection; 70.38(g))One commenter suggested that the definition of educational institutionbe modified to mean ``entities organized and operated exclusively for educationalpurposes.'' The intent of this modification is to expand the coverage ofthe proposed definition. It was taken from the Internal Revenue Code. Thedefinition in the proposal, adopted here, on the other hand, covers preschool,elementary or secondary schools, institutes of undergraduate and graduatehigher education, and institutes of professional and vocational educationwhich operate programs for scholarly research. The commenter's suggesteddefinition is clearly deficient in one respect, <T3>i.e., </T3>it fails to incorporate the statutory requirement that theinstitution be engaged in scholarly research. In any event, the Department'sdefinition is fashioned after an interim rule published by the AdministrativeConference of the United States <T3>see </T3>52 FR 22753, 22754 (June 16, 1987) and guidelines publishedby the Office of Management and Budget, <T3>see </T3>52 FR 10012, 10014 (March 27, 1987). For the reasons statedabove, and for the reasons set forth in the preamble to the OMB guidelines,the Labor Department also believes that use of the Internal Revenue Codeprovision for FOIA fee schedule purposes would be inappropriate. Modify Definition of ``Representative of the News Media'' (andSection; 70.38(i))One commenter criticized the definition of ``representative of the newsmedia'' because it requires that requests relate to current events or informationthat would be of current interest to the public. The commenter suggestedthat with the emphasis on current events, the regulation, as proposed,could be used to exclude requests that concern historical events. Thisis an overly-narrow construction of the proposed regulation. The Departmentinterprets the regulation as applying to both current events and historicalmatters of current interest to the public. Therefore, matters of historicalsignificance, in appropriate circumstances, are certainly encompassed withinthe regulation.Next, the commenter criticized the requirements to qualify as a freelancejournalist. The commenter argued that there is no basis for requiring afreelance journalist to be associated with a specific news organization,noting that many freelance journalists specifically choose not to associatewith one particular news organization, but send their articles to manydifferent ones without knowing where they will ultimately be published.The definition, contrary to the commenter's assertion, does not requireassociation with a specific news organization. A publication contract isbut one way of qualifying as a freelance journalist. A person's past publicationrecord can also qualify the individual for freelance journalist status.Finally, this commenter suggested that the definition of ``representativeof the news media'' be revised to read as follows: ``Any person or organizationwhich regularly publishes or disseminates information to the public, inprint or electronically.'' As this definition appears to exclude many personswho are covered by the proposed definition, it was considered to be unacceptable.Another commenter criticized the proposed definition because, in its view,the controlling factor for qualifying under it was not the identity ofthe requester, but instead, the nature of the information requested. This,in the agency's view, inaccurately reflects the intent of the definition.A number of factors are considered in the definition including the identityof the requester, the nature of the information requested and how the requesterintends to use the information. These matters are all germane to determiningwhether the requester should be treated as a representative of the newsmedia. For these reasons, the language of the section was not modified.Free Computer Search Time (andSection; 70.40(c)(4))Section 70.40(c)(4) provides that when computer searches are involved,<T3>i.e.,</T3> executing an existing program, the monetary equivalent oftwo hours of professional search time should be deducted from the totalcost of the computer processing time. One commenter objected to this provisionsuggesting instead that up to two hours of computer processing time befurnished free to the requester. The cost/hour of computer processing timeis, of course, considerably more expensive than the cost associated witha search performed by a professional employee. This agency interprets thestatute, as does the Office of Management and Budget, to require two freehours of search time at the rate attributable to search by a professionalemployee, not actual Central Processing Unit (CPU) time. With the costof CPU time for just one of DOL component's computer facility ranging from$700 to $1,800/hour, as opposed to $20 per hour for a search by a professionalemployee, it is unlikely that Congress expected the agency to absorb theforegoing expenses in providing free search time. Accordingly, the suggestionhas not been accepted.Modify Requirements for Fee Waiver (andSection; 70.41)The Labor Department regulation set forth at andSection; 70.41 sets out fivespecific requirements fashioned after the Justice Department's Guidance,all of which must be satisfied in order to be eligible for a fee waiver.One commenter has suggested that the five foregoing criteria be eliminatedand in their place the statutory language simply be inserted. This suggestionhas not been accepted for the reason that all the conditions which mustbe satisfied in order to be eligible for a fee waiver might not be clearto some requesters from just the statutory language. The manner in whichthe regulation separately treats each of these conditions is intended tobetter apprise the public of what requirements must exist in order to beeligible for a fee waiver. Consequently, the suggestion that the statutorylanguage replace the proposed regulation was not accepted.Another commenter suggested that certain categories of requesters, <T3>i.e.,</T3> public interest groups, scholars and journalists, shouldhave the benefit of an across-the-board irrebutable presumption in theirfavor under the fee waiver standard_in effect, that they should alwaysreceive a complete waiver of fees, regardless of what information is requestedor actually disclosed, solely on the basis of their identity. The Departmentof Labor does not agree that such claims of categorical entitlement tofee waivers are warranted. The interests of those seeking categorical entitlementto fee waivers have already been adequately addressed by Congress in thestatutory scheme. The claims of categorical entitlement for any particulargroup of FOIA requesters cannot be reconciled with the Act's revised feestructure. That is, the approach suggested would render entirely superfluousthe particular fee limitation provision specifically established by Congressfor such requesters. Accordingly, this suggestion was not accepted.This requester also suggested that the regulation clearly provide thatdocuments furnished to the government by third party submitters also qualifyfor fee waivers. The commenter maintains that the Justice Department Guidanceprecludes fee waiver treatment for these kinds of records. This, however,does not appear to be the case. Instead, the Justice Department Guidancestates: ``While in most cases records possessed by a federal agency willlikely meet the threshold, there are cases in which the requested recordsdo not directly concern government operations or activities and thereforewould fail to meet it. A prime example can be records in the agency's possessionthat were generated by a non-governmental entity, records which often aresought for the intrinsic informational content alone.'' The Justice DepartmentGuidance only provides that these types of documents may not in every instancebe eligible for fee waiver treatment, it does not declare that these typesof documents, as a class, are automatically ineligible for such treatment.Finally, the commenter proffered five criteria which it proposes to substitutefor the requirements set out in andSection; 70.21(a) (the proposed fee waiverregulations). The five criteria proposed by the commenter are as follows:(1) The information is sought: (a) Not for a primarily commercial purpose;(b) not for a primarily personal purpose; (c) in connection with an issueof government accountability, good government or any issue of general governmentconcern; (d) in order to further some kind of civic, political or publicactivity or communication; and (2) the information is not generally andeasily available to the public.The Labor Department has elected not to adopt the proposed substitution.First, the criteria proposed by the Labor Department are fashioned afterthe Justice Department Guidance. Contrary to the views of the commenter,this agency believes that the DOJ Guidance correctly reflects the intentof Congress when it enacted the fee waiver provision. In addition, therequirements proposed by the commenter fail to adequately address the statutoryrequirements, and in addition, are unnecessarily vague.<ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Comments</ITAG>A number of technical and editorial comments were received from severalcomponents of the Labor Department itself. Some of these suggestions wereaccepted. However, as none of those accepted addressed substantive considerations,but were essentially of an editorial nature, there appears to be no necessityfor reviewing those matters here.<ITAG tagnum="84">Procedural Matters</ITAG>This is not a major rule as defined by Executive Order 12291.

Anexample of such a statute is section 205(c) of the Labor-Management Reportingand Disclosure Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 435(c). Statutes such as theUser Fee Statute which only provide a general discussion of fees withoutexplicitly requiring that an agency set and collect fees for particulardocuments are not within the meaning of this term.(b) The term ``direct costs'' means those expenditures which an agencyactually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of acommercial requester, reviewing) documents to respond to an FOIA request.Direct costs includes the salary of the employee performing the work andthe cost of operating duplicating machinery, and when appropriate the costof the medium in which the information is made available.(c) The term ``duplication'' means the process of making a copy of a documentnecessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form ofpaper copy, microform, audio-visual materials or machine-readable documentation(e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others.(d) The term ``search'' means the process of looking for material thatis responsive to a FOIA request; including page-by-page or line-by-lineidentification of materials within documents or, when available, use ofan existing computer program. Searches do not include the review of material,as defined in andSection;70.38(e), which is performed to determine whethermaterial is exempt from disclosure.(e) The term ``review'' means the process of examining documents locatedin response to a request that is for a commercial use, as defined in andSection;70.38(f), to determine whether any portion of the document located is exemptfrom disclosure, and accordingly may be withheld. It also includes theact of preparing materials for disclosure, <T3>i.e. </T3>doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwiseprepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolvinggeneral legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.(f) The term ``commercial use request'' means a request from one who seeksinformation for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade orprofit interests of the requester or the person or entity on whose behalfthe request was submitted. When a request is submitted by a commercialentity or its representative and from the nature of the information soughtit appears the request is to further the objective of that entity, therequest will be treated as a commercial use request unless the requesterindicates that the information is being sought for a non-commercial purpose.Where a requester indicates that the information is being sought for anon-commercial purpose, the disclosure officer will evaluate the requester'ssubmission and determine how the request is to be treated. While requestsby non-profit organizations would normally fall outside the commercialuse category, when the disclosure officer determines that a request bysuch an entity or one acting on its behalf does further the entity's commercialinterests, he or she may treat the request as a commercial use request.(g) The term ``educational institution'' means:(1) An institution which is a preschool, a public or private elementaryor secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher education,an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of professionaleducation, or an institution of vocational education, and(2) Operates a program or programs of scholarly research. To qualify underthis definition, the program of scholarly research in connection with whichthe information is sought must be carried out under the auspices of theacademic institution itself as opposed to the individual scholarly pursuitsof persons affiliated with an institution. For example, a request froma professor to assist him or her in writing a book independent of his orher institutional responsibilities would not qualify under this definition,whereas a request predicated upon research funding granted to the institutionwould meet its requirements. Likewise, a request from a student enrolledin an individual course of study at an educational institution would notqualify as a request from the institution.(h) The term ``non-commercial scientific institute'' means an institutionthat is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term is definedin andSection;70.38(f), and that is operated soley for the purpose of conductingscientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote anyparticular product or industry.(i) The term ``representative of the news media'' means any person activelygathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publishor broadcast news to the public. Factors indicating such representationstatus include press accreditation, guild membership, a history of continuingpublication, business registration, and/or Federal Communication Commissionlicensing, among others. For purpose of this definition the term ``news''contemplates information that is about current events or that would beof current interest to the public. A freelance journalist shall be treatedas a representative of the news media if the person can demonstrate a solidbasis for expecting publication of matters related to the requested informationthrough a qualifying news media entity. A publication contract with a qualifyingnews media entity satisfies this requirement. An individual's past publicationrecord with organizations of the foregoing nature is also relevant to thisdetermination. Examples of news media entities include:(1) Television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and(2) Publishers of periodicals including newsletters (but only in thoseinstances where they can qualify as disseminators of news) who make theirproducts available for purchase or subscription by the general public.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;70.39 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Statutes specifically providing for setting of fees.</ITAG>Nothing in this subpart shall supersede fees chargeable under a statuteother than the Freedom of Information Act which specifically provides forsetting the level of fees for particular types of records.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;70.40 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Charges assessed for the production of records.</ITAG>(a) There are three types of charges assessed in connection with the productionof agency records in response to a Freedom of Information Act request:costs associated with(1) Searching for or locating responsive records (search costs),(2) Reproducing such records (reproduction costs), and(3) Reviewing records to determine whether any materials are exempt (reviewcosts).(b) There are four types of FOIA requesters:(1) Commercial use requesters,(2) Educational and non-commercial scientific institutions,(3) Representatives of the news media, and (4) all other requesters.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Depending upon the nature of the requester, one or all of the foregoingcosts may be assessed. Paragraph (c) of this section sets forth the extentto which the foregoing costs may be assessed against each type of requester.Paragraph (d) of this section establishes the actual rate to be chargedin connection with each of the foregoing types of costs. Paragraph (e)delineates the manner in which costs are to be assessed against an individualseeking access to records about himself or herself which are covered bythe Privacy Act.(c) (1) <T3>Commercial use requester. </T3>When a commercial use requester as definedin andSection;70.38(f) makes a request for documents, search costs, reproductioncosts and review costs may be assessed in their entirety.(2) <T3>Educational or non-commercial, scientific institution requester. </T3>Whenan educational or non-commercial scientific institution requester, as definedin andSection;andSection;70.38 (g) and (h), makes a request, only reproductioncosts may be assessed, excluding charges for the first 100 pages.(3) <T3>Request by representative of news media. </T3>When a representativeof the news media as defined in andSection;70.38(i) makes a request, onlyreproduction costs may be assessed, excluding charges for the first 100pages.(4) <T3>All other requesters. </T3>Requesters who do not fall within paragraphs(c) (1), (2), and (3) of this section may be charged search costs and reproductioncosts, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first twohours of search time shall be furnished without charge. Where computersearches are involved, i.e., executing an existing program, however, themonetary equivalent of two hours of search time by a professional employeeshall be deducted from the total costs of computer processing time.(d)(1) <T3>Search costs</T3>. When a search for records is performed by a clericalemployee, a rate of $2.50 per quarter hour will be applicable. When a searchis performed by professional or supervisory personnel, a rate of $5.00per quarter hour will be applicable. If the search for requested recordsrequires transportation of the searcher to the location of the recordsor transportation of the records to the searcher, all transportation costsin excess of $5.00 may be added to the search cost. When an existing computerprogram is employed to locate records responsive to a request, the disclosureofficer may charge the actual cost of providing the service.(2) <T3>Reproduction costs</T3>. The standard copying charge for documentsin paper copy is $.15 per page. When responsive information is providedin a format other than paper copy, such as in the form of computer tapesand discs, the requester may be charged the direct costs of the tape, discor whatever medium is used to produce the information, as well as any relatedreproduction costs.(3) <T3>Review costs</T3>. Costs associated with the review of documents, asdefined in andSection; 70.38(c), will be applicable at a rate of $5.00 perquarter hour. Except as noted below, charges may only be assessed for reviewat the initial level, i.e. the review undertaken the first time the documentsare analyzed to determine the applicability of specific exemptions to theparticular record or portion of the record. Thus a requester would notbe charged for review at the administrative appeal level with regard tothe applicability of an exemption already applied at the initial level.When, however, a record has been withheld pursuant to an exemption whichis subsequently determined not to apply and is reviewed again at the appellatelevel to determine the potential applicability of other exemptions, thecosts attendant to such additional review may be assessed.(4) <T3>Mailing cost</T3>. Where requests for copies are made by mail, no postagecharge will be made for transmitting by regular mail a single copy of therequested record to the requester, or for mailing additional copies wherethe total postage cost does not exceed $1. However, where the volume ofpage copy or method of transmittal requested is such that transmittal chargesto the Department are in excess of $1, the transmittal costs will be added,unless appropriate stamps or stamped envelopes are furnished with the request,or authorization is given for collection of shipping charges on delivery.(e) <T3>Privacy Act requesters</T3>. Requests from individuals for recordsabout themselves which are contained within agency systems of records shallbe treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 which permitthe assessment of reproduction costs only, after providing the first copyof a file at no cost.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 70.41 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Reduction or waiver of fees.</ITAG>This section sets forth conditions under which the applicable charges forrecords responsive to a request under 5 U.S.C. 552, as set forth in andSection;70.40, are subject to reduction or waiver by the disclosure officer.(a) <T3>Statutorily required waiver or reduction in fees</T3>. Documents shallbe furnished without charge or at a charge below the fees set forth inandSection; 70.40 if all of the following conditions are satisfied:(1) The subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activitiesof the United States Government;(2) The disclosure of the requested records is likely to contribute toan understanding of Government operations or activities;(3) The disclosure is likely to contribute to a public understanding ofsuch operations or activities;(4) The contribution to public understanding of government operations andactivities will be significant; and(5) The public's interest in disclosure exceeds the requester's commercialinterest in disclosure.(b) <T3>De minimis costs</T3>. Where the cost of collecting a fee to be assessedto a requester exceeds the amount of the fee which would otherwise be assessed,no fee need be charged. Under normal circumstances, fees which do not exceed$5.00 need not be collected.(c) <T3>Reformulating requests</T3>. When the estimated reproduction costsare likely to exceed $25.00, the requester may be notified of the estimatedamount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance its willingnessto pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such notice may invite the requesterto reformulate the request to satisfy his or her needs at a lower cost.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 70.42 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Ancillary considerations.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Costs assessed when no records are disclosed</T3>. The costs of searchingfor and, in the case of a commercial use request, reviewing records maybe assessed even where ultimately no documents are disclosed or located.(b) <T3>Aggregating requests</T3>. A requester may not file multiple requests,each seeking portions of a document or documents in order to avoid thepayment of fees. When there is reason to believe that a requester or agroup of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a requestdown into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessmentof fees, any such requests may be aggregated and the requesters chargedas if there were only a single request.(c) <T3>Advance payments</T3>. An advance payment before work is commencedor continued on a request, may not be required unless:(1) It is estimated or determined that the allowable charge that a requestermay be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. When a determinationis made that the allowable charges are likely to exceed $250, the requestershall be notified of the likely cost and be required to provide satisfactoryassurance of full payment where the requester has a history of prompt paymentof FOIA fees, or be required to tender advance payment of at least 50%of the full estimated charges in the case of requesters with no historyof payment; or(2) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timelyfashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing) in which casethe requester may be required:(i) To pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as providedin andSection; 70.41(e), when an outstanding balance is due and owing, and(ii) To make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated feebefore the component begins to process a new request.(3) In any case, the payment of outstanding fees may be required beforeresponsive materials are actually disclosed to a requester.(d) <T3>Time limits to respond extended when advance payments requested</T3>.When an advance payment of fees in accordance with paragraph (c) of thissection has been requested the administrative time limits prescribed insubsection (a)(6) of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6), will only begin to runafter such advance payment has been received by the agency.(e) <T3>Interest charges</T3>.
