The dates when surface subsidence begins andends, according to these standards, are the date when subsidence reaches15 mm and the date 6 months after which subsidence does not exceed 10%of the maximum calculated subsidence from the roadway in question, butis not more than 30 mm. Accidents to tower cranes because of subsidencehave occurred outside such periods. Horizontal as well as vertical shiftsneed to be considered, which means taking into account the dip angleof the seam. The recommended initial and final values for the subsidenceperiod are 5 mm, i.e. the period commences when subsidence reaches 5mm and ends at a date 6 months after which subsidence is not more than5 mm.</TEXT></DOC>
