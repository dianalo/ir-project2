The results ofa survey which was designed to measure the importance of uranium as anissue and reveal underlying influences and information behind publicperceptions are presented. The methods and questions asked are givenas well as the results. The results show that Australians are fairlyunconcerned about uranium. However, many fear the possible applicationof civil nuclear technology to nuclear weapons, a fear not recognisedor expected by the nuclear industry. The public image of the industrycould, and should, be improved by television, films and documentariesto inform the general public about the nuclear industry. (U.K.).</TEXT></DOC>
