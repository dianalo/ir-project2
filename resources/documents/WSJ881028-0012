Treasury bond prices posted their largest gains in about three weeks. Long-term Treasury issues jumped nearly a point, or almost $10 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the latest 30-year issue tumbled to 8.83% from 8.91%.    &quot;It really took the weakness in stocks to push the market&quot; higher, said James Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.    Municipal and mortgage-backed bonds also rallied. But junk bonds -- those issued by companies with low credit ratings or none at all -- failed to join in the rally. Traders said many large junk bond issues were little changed to down slightly.    Nervousness about junk bonds has spread as federal bank regulators have cautioned banks about lending for leveraged buy-outs. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said the Fed has warned banks to &quot;make certain they examine the prospects for LBO loans under a range of economic and financial circumstances.&quot;    Traders also cited a report in The Wall Street Journal yesterday that underwriters led by First Boston Corp. had pulled back on the $1.15 billion offering of junk bonds by Campeau Corp.'s Federated Department Stores Inc. unit. That move apparently came because investors were balking at buying the huge issue.    Some junk-bond analysts contend that the market remains solid. &quot;One shouldn't read too much into any one deal,&quot; said Bob Waill, a fixed-income analyst with L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co.    Mr. Waill and other analysts point to the fact that Fort Howard Corp. earlier this week was able to sell successfully $1.7 billion of junk bonds as part of its recent $3.87 billion leveraged buy-out engineered by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. Also, Arkansas Best Corp. yesterday sold $125 million of junk bonds as part of the financing for its $370 million leveraged buy-out.    Investment-grade corporate bonds generally were little changed to slightly higher. But the price of Eastman Kodak Co.'s new 16-year debentures fell sharply. The $300 million issue was launched late last week, shortly after corporate bond investors were stunned by news that RJR Nabisco Inc.'s management had proposed taking the huge company private in a leveraged buy-out.    The Treasury bond market's rally accelerated yesterday as the dollar rebounded against the yen and the mark. On Wednesday, the dollar's weakness was the main factor depressing bond prices.    Moreover, the possibility of fewer megadeals could help improve the outlook for lower interest rates, some investment managers say. &quot;If the LBO craze comes to a halt, that should be good news for bonds,&quot; said Jeffrey A. Poxon, chief investment officer of Lafayette Life Insurance Co. in Lafayette, Ind.    &quot;But I don't think it is going to come to a stop,&quot; Mr. Poxon added. &quot;I think at the most, this is a temporary setback.&quot;    Fears that rates will rise even further have prompted many institutions, such as Lafayette Life, to keep unusually large amounts of funds in cash and other short-term investments. &quot;We have more cash than at any time all year because we believe interest rates will be higher late this year or the early part of next year,&quot; Mr. Poxon said.    Treasury Securities   Helped by investor fears about stocks, long-term Treasury bonds finished near their highest levels of the day.    The Treasury's 30-year bonds jumped to 103 2/32 from 102 6/32. The latest 10-year notes rose to 103 1/2 from 103, cutting the yield to 8.71% from 8.78%.    Shorter-term issues posted smaller gains. For example, seven-year Treasury notes were quoted late yesterday at 100 5/32 to yield 8.59%. That compared with 99 26/32 Wednesday, to yield 8.66%.    The new two-year Treasury notes, auctioned by the government Tuesday at an average annual yield of 8.33%, were quoted late yesterday at 8.26%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds jumped 9.51 points, its largest gain since Oct. 7, to close at 1264.19. It ranged between 1253.98 and 1265.54. So far this year, the total return on the bonds in the index is 8.97%. Total return includes price changes and interest income.    Among short-term rates, the Treasury's latest three-month bills were quoted yesterday afternoon at 7.38% bid, down from 7.41% Wednesday. The latest six-month bill rate fell to 7.48% bid from 7.52%. -   Corporate Bonds   Corporate bond prices ended unchanged to 1/4 point higher in light trading.    Eastman Kodak's debenture offering was freed to trade late yesterday, and the issue fell more than a point.    Dealers said the debentures were being quoted at a spread of 1.3 percentage points above the rate of the average of the Treasury 10-year note and 30-year bond.    The 9 7/8% issue was priced late last week at 99.80 to yield 9.90%, a spread of 1.05 percentage points above Treasurys.    That 0.25 percentage point widening was in line with how other industrial corporate bonds have fared since RJR's announcement.    Meanwhile, U.S. corporate Eurobonds are recovering from the panic created by the RJR proposal.    After widening earlier in the week, yield spreads between top tier corporate issues and U.S. Treasurys have narrowed. Dealers attribute that to professional bargain-hunting, debt buy-backs by some issuers and a reluctance by investors to take losses.    And at least one London office of a U.S. bank said it has a corporate issue ready to launch at the first opportunity.    Yesterday, investors began a more noticeable switching out of double-A rated issues into triple-A names as they remained worried about the potential impact of buy-outs on creditworthiness.    Mortgage-Backed Securities   The recent rally in mortgage securities could prompt the Veterans Administration to cut its rate ceiling for guaranteed loans to 10% from 10 1/2% today.    Mortgage securities traders noted the VA usually reduces its ceiling when the current-coupon Ginnie Mae security begins to trade at an appreciable premium.    Current-coupon Ginnie Mae 10% securities, backed by 10 1/2% loans guaranteed by the VA or insured by the Federal Housing Administration, were trading at about 102 late yesterday.    A VA rate reduction would spur originations of 10% government-backed loans.    Traders said they think there's a good chance of a cut in the VA ceiling today partly because it would be politically advantageous for Vice President George Bush to have the move occur before election day. The VA usually changes its rate ceiling on Friday afternoons.    Meanwhile, mortgage securities showed moderate gains this session but lagged the advance in the Treasury market.    November Ginnie Mae 9% securities were quoted late yesterday at 96 1/2 bid, up 3/8; 9 1/2% securities were at 99 1/4 bid, up 10/32; 10% securities were at 101 7/8 bid, up 10/32; and Freddie Mac 9 1/2% securities were at 98 7/8 bid, also up 10/32.    The Ginnie Mae 9 1/2% securities were yielding 9.72% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the 10-year Treasury note widened three basis points to 102.    Municipals   Municipal bonds finished 1/8 to 1/4 point higher, as a late wave of buying brought the market to life after steady trading early in the day.    New Jersey Turnpike's 7.20% issue of 2018 gained 1/4 point to end at 95 5/8 bid. The yield fell to 7.57% from 7.58%.    A New York trader contended that corporate bond sales are sending some &quot;flight-to-quality&quot; buying to municipals.    Traders say this week's new issuance, which totals more than $1 billion, has hardly depressed the market.    &quot;There's not a lot of supply around,&quot; said a New York market specialist, terming the new issues &quot;a drop in the bucket.&quot;    Foreign Bonds   Foreign government bond prices rallied amid speculation that the dollar could weaken in the months ahead, boosting demand for non-dollar securities.    In Tokyo, traders said investors are becoming more confident that a trend toward a weakening dollar is likely to continue.    The benchmark No. 105 5% bonds of 1997 rose 0.19 percentage point to 102.10 to yield 4.67%, down from 4.70% Wednesday.    West German government bond traders predict that government bond yields will fall to 6 1/4% after a warm reception for a new offering.    The government's benchmark 6 3/4% bonds due 1998 were quoted yesterday at 102.90 to yield 6.339%, up 0.10 point. The government's new offering came as expected with a 6 3/8% coupon at a price of 100 1/2.    British government bonds rallied a full point on hopes that September's trade data signals an end to recent sharp increases in domestic demand.    However, the data, which showed a narrowing in the country's current account gap to #560 million ($986.3 million) from #1.31 billion in August, were treated skeptically by many analysts because of heavy distortions caused by erratic items.    In the gilt market, prices were immediately pushed higher but trading was said to have been limited largely to market makers covering short positions.    The government's benchmark 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007 ended up one point at 118 4/32 with the yield tumbling to 9.40%. </TEXT></DOC>
