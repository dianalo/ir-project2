Each power cell includesa frame, a gas-consuming cathode mounted at one end of the frame, a consumableanode, a flexible diaphragm mounting the anode in the frame to providefor longitudinal and annular movement of the anode as the anode is consumed.The flexible diaphragm cooperates with the frame to define a sealed expansionchamber on the side of the anode opposite the cathode, first means forintroducing fluid under pressure into the expansion chamber to bias theanode toward the cathode, the flexible diaphragm cooperating with theframe to define a sealed flow passage between the anode and the cathode,second means for introducing electrolyte into the flow passage, meansspacing and sealing adjacent cell frames providing separate passage meansfor soluble gas to the gas-consuming cathode, and third means for introducingsoluble gas into the separate passage means.</TEXT></DOC>
