<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-61-0907 </DOCNO><TEXT>A Skyrme-model calculation of weak radiative baryon octet and decupletdecays is presented, based on a Lagrangian describing weak nonleptonicdecays of mesons previously discussed by Donoghue and collaborators.There are no free parameters in the Skyrme-model predictions for weakradiative decays, as all necessary parameters are obtained from othercontexts. The predictions of the Skyrme model for the weak radiativebaryon decays are in good qualitative agreement with experiment, exceptfor {Sigma}{sup +}{yields}p{gamma}, where however the model involvessubstantial cancellations among terms which are sensitive to small changesof input parameters.</TEXT></DOC>
