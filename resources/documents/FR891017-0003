TheMediterranean fruit fly (Medfly) can cause serious economic losses. Heavyinfestations can cause complete loss of crops, and losses of 25 to 50 percentare not uncommon. The short life cycle of this pest permits the rapid developmentof serious outbreaks. A document effective August 23, 1989, and published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 29, 1989 (54 FR 35629-35635, DocketNumber 89-146), established the Mediterranean fruit fly regulations andquarantined an area in Los Angeles County, California (7 CFR 301.78 <T3>et seq</T3>.; referred to below as the regulations). In an interimrule effective September 14, 1989, and published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 20, 1989 (54 FR 38643-38645, DocketNumber 89-169), we amended the Mediterranean fruit fly regulations by addinga portion of Santa Clara County, California, to the list of quarantinedareas.  These areas remain infested with the Mediterranean fruit fly. The regulations impose restrictions on the interstate movement of regulatedarticles from quarantined areas in order to prevent the spread of the Mediterraneanfruit fly to noninfested areas. Recent trapping surveys by inspectors of California State and county agenciesand by inspectors of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, aunit within the U.S. Department of Agriculture, reveal that additionalinfestations of Medfly have been discovered in Los Angeles and San BernardinoCounties in California. Specifically, inspectors collected more than 69 adult Mediterranean fruitflies in Los Angeles County, near Valinda, Baldwin Park, and Whittier,California, during the period of September 19, 1989, to October 3, 1989.During this period, inspectors also found 33 Mediterranean fruit fly larvaeinfesting fruit in the same area. In addition, one mated female Medflywas found near Alta Loma in San Bernardino County. The regulations in andSection; 301.78-3 provide that the Administrator ofthe Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service shall list as a quarantinedarea each State, or each portion of a State, in which the Mediterraneanfruit fly has been found by an inspector, in which the Administrator hasreason to believe the Mediterranean fruit fly is present, or that the Administratorconsiders necessary to regulate because of its inseparability for quarantineenforcement purposes from localities in which the Mediterranean fruit flyhas been found. In accordance with these criteria, we are designating as quarantined areasthe following areas in Los Angeles and San Bernardino Counties, California:<ITAG tagnum="73">Los Angeles County </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">That portion of the county in the Valinda, Baldwin Park, and Whittierareas bounded by a line drawn as follows: Beginning at the intersectionof Santa Anita Avenue and Duarte Road; then east along this road to itsintersection with Mayflower Avenue; then north along this avenue to itsintersection with Interstate Highway 210; then east along this highwayto its intersection with Grand Avenue; then south along this avenue toits intersection with Valley Boulevard; then south along this boulevardto its intersection with Brea Canyon Road; then south along this road toits intersection with State Highway 60; then west along this highway toits intersection with Nogales Street; then south along this street to ColimaRoad; then west along this road to its intersection with Fullerton Road;then south along this road to the northern city limits of La Habra Heights;then northwest along the city limits to its intersection with HaciendaBoulevard; then south along this boulevard to its intersection with the Los Angeles/Orange County line; then west and south along this countyline to its intersection with La Habra Boulevard; then west along thisboulevard to its intersection with Leffingwell Road; then southwest alongthis road to its intersection with Imperial Highway; then west along thishighway to its intersection with Interstate Highway 5; then north alongthis highway to its intersection with Garfield Avenue; then north alongthis avenue to its intersection with Whittier Boulevard; then east alongthis boulevard to its intersection with Wilcox Avenue; then north alongthis avenue to Pomona Boulevard; then east along this boulevard to itsintersection with Potrero Grande Drive; then east along this drive to itsintersection with San Gabriel Boulevard; then north along this boulevardto its intersection with Garvey Avenue; then east along this avenue toits intersection with Santa Anita Avenue; then north along this avenueto the point of the beginning. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">San Bernardino County </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">That portion of the county bounded by a line beginning at the intersectionof the Los Angeles and San Bernardino County line with the Los AngelesNational Forest boundary; then east along the Los Angeles National Forestboundary to its intersection with the San Bernardino National Forest boundary;then east and south along this boundary to its intersection with RochesterAvenue; then south along this avenue to its intersection with 8th Street;then west along this street to its intersection with Miliken Avenue; thensouth along this avenue to its intersection with Interstate Highway 10;then west along this highway to its intersection with Holt Boulevard; thenwest along this boulevard to its intersection with Central Avenue; thennorth along this avenue to its intersection with Foothill Boulevard; thenwest along this boulevard to its intersection with the San Bernardino Countyline; then north along this county line to the point of beginning.</ITAG>There does not appear to be any reason to designate other additional quarantinedareas in California other than the areas specified above. California hasadopted and is enforcing regulations imposing restrictions on the intrastatemovement of the regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposedon the interstate movement of regulated articles under this subpart. <ITAG tagnum="84">Emergency Action </ITAG>James W. Glosser, Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, has determined that an emergency situation exists, which warrantspublication of this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment.Because the Mediterranean fruit fly could be spread to noninfested areasof the United States, it is necessary to act immediately to prevent itsspread. Since prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this interimrule are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under theseconditions, there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effectiveupon signature. We will consider comments received within 60 days of publicationof this interim rule in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4> After the comment period closes, we will publishanother document in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> including a discussion of any comments we receiveand any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291. This regulation affects the interstate movement of regulated articles fromportions of Los Angeles and San Bernardino Counties, California. Approximately345 entities will be affected by this rule. All would be considered smallentities. They include fruit/produce vendors, nurseries, grape vineyards,citrus groves, community gardens and flea markets. Specifically, in LosAngeles County the following entities would be affected by this rule: 110growers of avocados, 50 nurseries, 30 fruit stands, 1 swap meet, and 6growers of persimmons. In San Bernardino County the following entitieswould be affected: 60 nurseries, 3 growers of tomatoes, peppers, and apples,2 olive processors, 2 hobbyist wineries, and 80 growers with a total of600 acres of citrus and grapes. These entities comprise less than 1 percentof the total of similar enterprises operating in the State of California.Most of the sales for these entities are local intrastate and would notbe affected by this regulation. Further, the conditions in the Mediterraneanfruit fly regulations and treatments in the Plant Protection and QuarantineTreatment Manual, incorporated by reference in the regulations, allow interstatemovement of most articles without significant added costs. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The regulations in this subpart contain no information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372 </ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with State and local officials (See 7 CFRpart 3015, subpart V).  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 301 </ITAG>Agricultural commodities, Plant diseases, Plant pests, Plants (Agriculture),Quarantine, Transportation, Mediterranean fruit fly, Incorporation by reference.Accordingly, 7 CFR part 301 is amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 301_DOMESTIC QUARANTINE NOTICES </ITAG>1.
