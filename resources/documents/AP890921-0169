Manuel Antonio Noriega.   The blacklist prohibits any U.S. company from dealing with the14, with a possible penalty of 10 years imprisonment or a $50,000fine, or both.   The move was announced in a press release by the U.S. Embassy inPanama City and in a Treasury Department announcement published inthe Federal Register in Washington.   It was part of a continuing campaign by the U.S. government toforce the ouster of Noriega, who was indicted by two U.S. federalgrand juries last year in Florida on drug trafficking charges.   Noriega holds the real power in Panama through his command of thePanamanian Defense Forces.   Former opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara enteredthe second day of a hunger strike to back his plea that Panamaniansrefrain from gambling or playing the lottery in an effort to cutgovernment revenue.   International observers say Endara won last May's elections by a3-to-1 margin, but the Noriega-controlled government nullified thatvote and installed a provisional president.   Carlos Duque, Endara's main opponent and a Noriega associate,headed the list of individuals and companies residing in Panama thatare banned from doing business with U.S. firms.   Many Panamanian companies do business with U.S. operations suchas the Panama Canal Commission and the U.S. Southern Command, whichhas military installations in Panama with about 14,000 soldiers.   The United States has moved all its personnel on base andrestricted off base movement.   Washington imposed economic sanctions on the Panamaniangovernment early last year, freezing its assets in the United Statesand barring U.S. companies from paying Panamanian taxes.   Canal revenues due to go to Panama were also frozen.   The Treasury Department blacklist is made up of associates orfriends of Noriega and will probably be expanded, said a U.S.official, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Noriega denies the drug charges and says U.S. economic help tothe political opposition in Panama made fair elections impossible.   He says moves against him are part of a U.S. plot to renege onits obligations to turn the Panama Canal over to Panama at the endof the century.</TEXT></DOC>
