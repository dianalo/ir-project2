ScheierandM;In many companies, training is an expensive, time-consuming chore.andM;But Manpower Inc. is using training as a strategic weapon to help sell thefirm's temporary services.andM;In the process, the Milwaukee firm is showing how information-systemsorganizations can help their companies penetrate new markets and providehigh-quality service.andM;Manpower first developed its computer-based training courses to help itsever-changing army of temporary employees use popular computer software.andO;(See PC Week, Feb.andP;  26, Page 127.)andM;But since 1987, Manpower has been using its training courses to help IBM sellits PC and midrange hardware and software.andM;As an IBM Business Partner, Manpower's &quot;office automation specialists&quot;accompany IBM sales reps on some sales calls and demonstrate Manpower'sdisk-based software training program, Skillware.andM;If IBM makes the sale, Manpower gets a commission based on how much itcontributed to the sales effort, according to Mitchell Fromstein, Manpower'spresident and CEO.andM;But Manpower doesn't charge the customer for the training, he said.andP;  Instead,Fromstein said, &quot;we take that compensation [from IBM] and convert it intoservices,&quot; in the form of training for the customer's users.andP;  Often, thecustomer wants more training than the IBM money covers, and will pay Manpowerto provide it, said Director of Strategic Communications Sharon Canter.andM;Why doesn't Manpower keep the commission and charge the customer for thetraining?andM;&quot;Because, ultimately, our goal is to be a provider of temporary workers,&quot;Fromstein said.andP;  &quot;There is nothing more powerful, in selling our reliabilityand capability in terms of providing quality temporary workers, than to havetrained the permanent staff people.&quot;andM;In fact, Manpower's entire involvement in the selling process is aimed atweaving tight links between itself and the customers both it and IBM serve.andM;When a customer sees a Manpower representative as part of an IBM sales call,&quot;it designates us as being knowledgeable about the IBM products,&quot; saidFromstein.andM;Such sales calls are typically made to information-management directors orother high-level executives -- far higher in the organizational chart thanthe secretaries who choose which &quot;temp&quot; agency to call.andM;But if IBM sells its hardware, Manpower will often get to train thosesecretaries and build personal relationships that pay off over time.andM;&quot;The fact we are there, on premises, doing this [training] work just plugs usin to the right people,&quot; said Fromstein.andM;Manpower's &quot;get close to the customer&quot; strategy also helps IBM, becauseManpower regularly surveys its major customers on everything from what PCsthey plan to buy to how pleased they were with Manpower temps.andM;This yields valuable information about the customer's future plans, whichManpower shares with IBM to help shape specific sales pitches for specificcustomers.andM;Manpower is also considering offering its customers a software help telephoneline that it developed for its temporary work force, said Fromstein.andM;Manpower is now field-testing the help line at some major clients, and plansto introduce it sometime in 1991, said Fromstein.andM;One of the biggest challenges to turning the help line into a product, hesaid, is that &quot;you can't play at this game.andP;  You have to have your [internal]support systems in very good shape before you market them.&quot;andM;But a major advantage is that by developing training or support for internaland external use at the same time, &quot;our research costs and our developmentcosts are very easily justified,&quot; he said.andM;Such close interlinkings between suppliers and customers were a key theme atthe Hammer Sales and Marketing Conference held in Boston last month,sponsored by the Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm Hammer andamp; Co.andM;Morton Rosenthal, chairman and CEO of Corporate Software Inc., a Westwood,Mass., software reseller, told the conference how his company's electronicsales-tracking systems are linked to those at Microsoft Corp. and LotusDevelopment Corp.andM;When sales reps for Microsoft or Lotus close a major deal, they're morelikely to steer the delivery of the software through Corporate Software thananother software reseller, said Rosenthal.andM;That's because Corporate Software notifies the vendor more quickly about thesale, so the sales representatives get their commission checks more quickly,he said.andM;&quot;The broader a web of relationships you can build, interacting with as manydifferent parts of the organization as you can, the harder you are todisplace,&quot; said Hammer andamp; Co.andP;  President Michael Hammer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
