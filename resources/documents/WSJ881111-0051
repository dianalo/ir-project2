In a day-long meeting with securities analysts, GTE executives said GTE, based in Stamford, Conn., intends to be among the country's lowest-cost phone concerns. James L. &quot;Rocky&quot; Johnson, chairman, said that to help meet this goal, job cuts in operations are likely to be &quot;as large as&quot; the 7,000 staff jobs GTE said on Wednesday it plans to cut from its local-phone operations by 1992.    &quot;We should have a better fix&quot; in the first quarter on the number, type and timing of additional job cuts, Mr. Johnson said. Analysts estimated GTE would have to cut a total of between 15,000 to 17,000 jobs in phone operations to become as efficient as some of the Bell regional holding companies. GTE's phone operations currently employ 85,000.    GTE is in the process of restructuring its phone operations, consolidating staffs into a new central headquarters, automating functions and updating its phone networks. The location of the new headquarters will be announced next week, GTE said.    Mr. Johnson also said GTE intends to expand in information services, new phone services and, if permitted, into cable television. &quot;We could compete in cable TV very effectively,&quot; Mr. Johnson said. In an experiment in Cerritos, Calif., GTE plans to send television to homes over fiber-optic cables.    GTE executives said in interviews that the company considered purchasing General Electric Co.'s GE Information Services Co. unit, but rejected the idea in part because the GE business didn't appear to have enough profit potential. Executives estimate GE Information Services has annual revenue of $500 million and annual earnings of $10 million or $20 million. GE executives have indicated GE may be willing to sell the business. &quot;We don't see it (the GE unit) worth what they are asking for it,&quot; Mr. Johnson said.    Mr. Johnson said GTE will consider making acquisitions that can earn their cost of capital. The company isn't currently interested in divesting any major operations, he said. Besides phone companies, GTE owns a light-bulb and precision-materials business.    Mr. Johnson also said that if GTE &quot;can flirt&quot; with a return-on-equity of 20% in the next five years, &quot;I'd be a very happy man.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
