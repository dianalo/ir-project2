A hurricane warning was posted for parts of the North Carolinaand Virginia coasts, where seas swelled in some areas to 8 feet andsome residents and tourists began to flee. Further south, officialsdeclared a state of emergency in Augusta, Ga., where flood watersclosed roads and engulfed houses.   ``All of our roads are flooded,'' said Pam Smith, director ofthe Richmond County Emergency Management Agency in Augusta.``People are trapped in their homes. People are hollering out forhelp through their windows. Some are on the rooftops. There arepeople in their cars floating down the road.''   At noon a.m. EDT, Lili was about 400 miles southeast of CapeHatteras, N.C., moving west at near 18 mph with winds near 75 mph.Earlier, the hurricane brought rain, thunderstorms and wind guststo Bermuda.   It was expected to veer northwest and then north.   ``If it's going to hit land, it's going to hit tomorrowmorning,'' said Daniel Petersen, meteorologist at the NationalHurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.   ``But it's definitely too early to say, especially if it turnsto the north, then you're paralleling the whole East Coast - and atthat point it turns into a high-tech guessing game,'' Petersen saidearly today.   A hurricane warning was in effect from northeast of TopsailBeach, N.C., to Virginia Beach, Va. A hurricane watch was extendedfrom north of Virginia Beach to Cape Henlopen, Del., includingChesapeake Bay, and from Topsail Beach southward to Littl RiverInlet, S.C.   Remnants of Marco, which brought 65 mph wind and 5 inches ofrain to Florida's Gulf Coast on Thursday before it broke up, dumpedheavy rain early today in Georgia. Overflowed creeks put roadsunder 6 feet of water, and more than 40 people were forced toevacuate in eastern Georgia's Richmond County.   The storm was expected to move through western North Carolinatoday.   The entire East Coast could see severe weather as the stormsconverge, forecasters said.   ``There's not only Marco, but Hurricane Lili, a cold front ...all converging on the East Coast in the next few days,'' said BobSheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables,Fla. ``All the weather conditions that these are creating canproduce heavy rain over the East Coast and that's of someconcern.''   On the Outer Banks, hundreds of Ocracoke Island tourists boardedferries for the mainland today.   ``There've been a lot of campers coming off,'' said Laura Peele,receptionist at the Hatteras-Ocracoke ferry office. ``The peoplewho were staying at the Park Service campground and motels, they'retrying to get out.''   Some of the island's 700 year-round residents also were leavingthe narrow barrier island.   ``My wife and two kids I've sent away,'' said Bob Touhey, ownerof Ocracoke's Island Inn. ``I'll board up and put things away.''   Rain from remnants of Tropical Storm Klaus was blamed for atleast five deaths Wednesday in the Carolinas and a train derailmentthat spilled 3,000 gallons of diesel fuel but caused no injuries.   Three people, including two children, were killed when they weretrapped in a stalled car by a surge of water after a dam collapsedin Kershaw County, S.C. Another child was missing and presumeddead. Two men were killed in traffic accidents in North Carolina.   Nearly a foot of rain fell within 24 hours by Thursday in partsof South Carolina. Sumter County received more than 15 inches ofrain since Wednesday.   ``Rainfall like that does not occur more than once in every 100years. There are certainly some areas where it was a 100-yearevent,'' said state climatologist John Purvis.   In eastern Georgia, police said flooding caused three drowningdeaths. In Columbia County, Guy Keller Dean Jr., 49, of Evans,drowned after he was swept away by flood waters as he tried toleave his car and make his way to higher ground, said CoronerThomas King.   In Jefferson County, a man was killed on Georgia Highway 4 eightmiles south of Louisville when when his car hit high water and wentout of control. Authorities said another body was discovered on acounty road road in Wrens.   In Brantley County, Ga., the sheriff's department said a tornadoapparently touched down late Thursday night in an area along theSatilla River. Deputy Lamar Depratter said some weekend fishingcabins were damaged, but no injuries were reported.   In Augusta, Ms. Smith said emergency officials used boats toevacuate some residents and called for citizens withfour-wheel-drive vehicles to assist in rescue efforts.   The water pressure blew covers off manholes, and several diveteams were brought in to assist people stranded in the flood watersalong the highways, Ms. Smith said. A two-mile stretch ofInterstate 20 near Augusta was among the roads that were closed.   Public schools in Augusta were closed, as were city and countyoffices and some businesses.   ``We got so much rain, so fast in such a short amount of time,''Ms. Smith said. ``We've never had anything like this.''</TEXT></DOC>
