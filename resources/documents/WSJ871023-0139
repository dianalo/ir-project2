They didn't quote the results of the projective questions that I asked. These projective questions always must alternate a positive statement on a subject with a negative statement. This was done in the Bork poll.    Over the years, we have found that unless a nominee for the high court is found to be unqualified or lacking in moral character, the public is inclined to lean toward going along with the choice of the president. Indeed, just a year earlier, when Justice Rehnquist was named to the post of chief justice, a 57% to 39% majority agreed with the president's choice. In the case of Judge Bork, a 67% to 27% majority no longer thought that having been nominated by President Reagan was a good reason to support his confirmation.    On the negative statements tested, a substantial 68% to 27% majority agreed with the criticism of Judge Bork's position that the right to privacy for married couples to use birth-control devices in their bedrooms, as stated in Griswold v. Conn., doesn't have any rooting in the Constitution. Finally, on the oft-repeated charges that the judge seemed to be too extreme a conservative and that he would turn back the clock on minority and women's rights, a much narrower 47% to 41% plurality agreed with that criticism.    The net of these results, quite apart from the final 57% to 29% who then answered that Judge Bork should be turned down for the Supreme Court, amply demonstrate that the public wasn't buying positive reasons for backing the judge and was inclined to agree with negative arguments against his confirmation.    In your own editor's comment, you say that Judge Bork never made the statement I attributed to him. Technically, you are correct. However, he did say in answer to a question from Sen. Biden on Sept. 15 before the Judiciary Committee that &quot;one of the problems with the right of privacy is . . . that it comes out of nowhere and it doesn't have any rooting in the Constitution. . . .&quot; To have asked about this direct quote would have been difficult for some respondents to understand. I don't think I have taken Judge Bork's position out of context nor inaccurately. A check with many of those who followed the Bork hearings and all of his statements on this issue, such as his original article in the 1971 Indiana Law Journal, agrees that this accurately describes the judge's position to this day. While our written questionnaire mistakenly had quotes around the paraphrase of Judge Bork's views, these didn't affect the actual questioning, since it was all verbal on the telephone and no respondent saw the statement in quotes.    Over the years, I have had to get used to criticism and even vilification from those who believe their cause has been damaged by the results of one of my polls. I remember vividly Hubert Humphrey vigorously telling me my poll was &quot;all wet and the wording of the question is biased,&quot; when his rating as vice president came up negative on the eve of the Democratic Convention. President Jimmy Carter bitterly attacked my polls when I reported that 71% thought he was incompetent.    Implied in the piece was that I should have asked about Sen. Kennedy's behavior in the hearings. I did poll on the fairness of the Judiciary Committee to Judge Bork, and a 56% to 20% majority thought the committee had been fair. I would also point out that after the Chappaquiddick episode, our poll for Time magazine was widely viewed as the most blunt and unsparing of Sen. Kennedy.    By the same token, I recall well in 1980, when ours was the only published poll to flatly predict that Ronald Reagan would be elected by a clear margin, liberal friends of mine accused me of selling out to the conservative side. The late Roy Cohn congratulated me for &quot;having the guts to stand up to the Eastern liberal establishment&quot; in my Reagan forecast.    The fact is that all such attributions are patent nonsense. The day I do not report what makes me cry will be the day I get out of my business.    As for Profs. Friedman and Casper on their suggested questionnaire, they have three pro-Bork and only one anti-Bork statements, which violates the rule of a positive and a negative always in balance. Clearly, they don't understand the craft of polling. I suppose it is akin to my taking on Prof. Friedman for his oft-repeated predictions of what will happen to inflation. That would be beyond my ken. I am therefore genuinely saddened that such distinguished scholars would join the ranks of the zealots, simply because they cannot stand the set of public opinion on Judge Bork. Of course, this is not the first nor will it be the last time that those who don't like my message will try to kill the messenger.    Louis Harris   Louis Harris and Associates   New York</TEXT></DOC>
