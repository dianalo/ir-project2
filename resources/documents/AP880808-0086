GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tens of thousands of Burmese marched inRangoon and 14 other cities Monday to protest the government ofPresident Sein Lwin, and eight people were killed, diplomats andofficial media reported.   Rangoon radio, monitored in Bangkok, reported ``massdemonstrations'' in areas ranging from Moulmein on the southerncoast to Taunggyi in the wild, mountainous area of the Shan states.   It reported ``violent incidents'' in Mandalay, 370 miles northof Rangoon, and Mergui on the southern coast, with four peoplekilled and 12 wounded by security forces in each city. No violencewas reported in Rangoon.   Newspapers in Rangoon reported weekend demonstrations in Pegu,Thanatpin and Yenangyaung, and said police opened fire to dispersecrowds. At least five people were reported killed and severalwounded.   Japan's Kyodo News Agency reported from Rangoon that 30,000people marched and demonstrated in the capital Monday and more than10,000 students, Buddhist monks and citizens went into the streetsof Mandalay, Burma's second-largest city.   ``It was learned that the security forces used louspeakersrequesting demonstrators to disperse and completely avoided usingtheir weapons to impose control'' in Rangoon, the radio said.   In a detailed account rare for Burma's official media, the radiosaid protesters in Rangoon marched and chanted slogans,congregating both in the heart of the city and in outlying areas.Up to 4,000 were said to have been involved in one demonstration.   The radio said 62 people had been arrested for looting or``agitation'' since Sunday.   Student activists spread pamphlets urging the overthrow of SeinLwin and had called for a nationwide general strike Monday. Rangoonresidents said the date was chosen because eight is an auspiciousnumber and Monday was the eighth day of the eighth month of 1988.   Many stores were reported closed, but it was difficult fordiplomats in Rangoon to determine how many factory workers, civilservants and others stayed away from work there and in other partsof the country.   Returning tourists said taxi drivers demanded twice the normalrate for rides and U.S. dollars were in great demand.   Foreign journalists have followed developments by telephone andby monitoring official media because of restrictions on travel toRangoon, the only legal entry point for most outsiders. Foreignreporters usually entered the country in the past on tourist vbisasissued at Burmese embassies.   Days after his election late last month, Sein Lwin ordered thearrests of the most outspoken critic of the authoritariangovernment, former Brig. Gen. Aung Gyi, other dissidents andAssociated Press correspondent Sein Win.   The International Federation of Newspaper Publishers in Parissaid it had sent a telegram to Sein Lwin asking for ``assurancesthat this distinguished newsman is not being detained forexercising any of his human rights, including those of freedom ofexpression and free journalistic activity.''   Sein Win, 66, received the federation's Golden Pen of Freedomaward in 1963.   Martial law was declared in Rangoon last Wednesday afterdemonstrators marched through the city demanding the ouster of SeinLwin, a former general who became president and head of thegovernment party when Ne Win resigned after 26 years in power.   In Bangkok, visiting Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britainsaid her government could do little to encourage democracy and amore liberal economic system in Burma, a former British colony.   ``I don't think that there is anything we can do,'' she told anews conference. ``It's a problem that Burma will have to solveherself. ... She's a very independent country.''   Virtually every major city and town in Burma has been the siteof anti-government demonstrations since last fall.   Rangoon radio said Sunday authorities investigating recentdisturbances had found a list of those ``who pulled the stringsfrom behind the scenes,'' but gave no details.   It also said 80 people detained at Insein prison had been freed.Those released _ 11 students, 66 other civilians and three civilservants _ appeared to be those among 149 reported arrested lastweek.   Students have led the protest against Sein Lwin, whom they blamefor the bloody suppression of demonstrations in Rangoon duringMarch and June.</TEXT></DOC>
