People come to the Sheldon Mountain House to climb staggeringwalls of gray rock ringing the Ruth Glacier, to ski or just to lookand listen. They gaze at the intricacies of McKinley, NorthAmerica's tallest peak, and its cousins, Mount Dan Beard and theragged Rooster Comb. They listen to the quiet of the Alaskatwilight, hear the wind and the sliding snow.   The hexagonal house is a simple place in an extraordinaryenvironment.   The structure can become a solarium as sun beats through thelarge windows on five of six sides. The building, at 5,810 feet,also is a shelter from the fierce storms of the Alaska Range.   The house, in a glacial amphitheater with a clear view of20,320-foot McKinley's summit, is a half-hour flight fromTalkeetna. The trip takes in the confluence of three rivers, milesof scrubby black spruce and brown tundra, dozens of ponds, brown atfirst and then brilliant blue as the glacial moraine appears below.Toothy pinnacles jut toward the sky as the plane drones through agorge.   The late bush pilot Don Sheldon designed the Mountain House andsupervised its construction in 1966. He acquired five acres in theRuth Amphitheater before it became part of Denali National Park andPreserve.   The house was built for use by mountaineers, photographers andsightseers.   ``It's been booked solid for the last five or six years,'' saysRoberta Sheldon, who was the radio operator when her husband landedski-equipped airplanes on Ruth Glacier. ``It's been a gradualevolution, just like the growth of the tourist industry inTalkeetna.''   The house is perched on a jagged outcropping about 100 feetabove a snowfield that serves as a runway.   ``The glaciers are moving and changing,'' Sheldon says. ``It washard to find a stable place to build the house.''   Once it was built, the 196-square-foot house proved up to thetest of 20 years of harsh weather and seasonal occupancy.   Sixty-five dollars buys a night's lodging and wood for thestove. An outhouse stands 50 yards away.   The house is furnished with four cushioned benches that doubleas beds. Visitors are expected to bring sleeping bags and their ownfood, although previous occupants have left supplies. Cereal,canned stew, four kinds of mustard, pancake mix and real maplesyrup are among the provisions.   Packed along two walls of the one-room house is more culinaryequipment _ including a wok _ than many home kitchens can claim.   There are things to read in this mountain studio, as well. Booksand magazines line part of a shelf, along with Scrabble and othergames. A chin-up bar fashioned from a stick of firewood, amountaineer's carabiner and nylon webbing hangs from the slantedceiling.   But for the landings and takeoffs by planes that use theice-and-snow runway below the house, it would be insulated from theworld outside. At the height of the summer tourist season, lightplanes carrying sightseers interested in 10 minutes on Ruth Glacierland several times an hour.   Noise echoes from one ridge to another as the planes come andgo, the snow acting as a brake that allows them to land inone-fourth the space needed for takeoff.   Users of the Mountain House over the years have includedorganized mountaineering groups. Genet Expeditions of Anchoragerented the building during the month of May for several years, withthe house serving as a base of operations and clients sleeping intents nearby.   ``It was nice to be able to dry out gear,'' said Mike Howerton,Genet Expeditions general manager and a guide. ``It just made for amore comfortable recuperation area.''   The house also has served as a base for mountain rescues.   Howerton warns against a casual attitude about activities in theRuth area. Precautions that would be adequate in many othercross-country ski areas aren't enough here. He recommends skiersrope themselves together for safety in case one falls into acrevasse while crossing the snow.   ``It's a hassle, but skiing roped is the only way to go upthere,'' Howerton says. ``It's a place where you have to be verycareful.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
