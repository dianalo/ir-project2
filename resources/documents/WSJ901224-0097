A warehouse supervisor hired as temporary holiday help inOctober had seemed the model employee. He stayed late mostnights to help with the Christmas rush, cleaning up after hisseven subordinates left. His job application showedexperience running warehouses, and he was pleasant andenergetic.</LP><TEXT>   But the employee was a hard-core thief. When several$8,000 fur coats turned up missing, Jack L. Hayes, aStanfordville, N.Y., security consultant, posted a watchbehind the warehouse late one night -- and caught thesupervisor tucking coats into his car. The man didn't havethe experience claimed on his application, but the businessowner had &quot;never bothered to check,&quot; Mr. Hayes says. &quot;And I'msure the employee knew that.&quot;   For many small businesses, 'tis the season to be wary.Small-business owners are especially vulnerable to anincreased risk of internal fraud and theft during theholidays, and many are ill-prepared to cope. A flood ofseasonal transactions and gifts can mask increased employeetheft or payoffs. Holiday bills tempt employees todishonesty. An increase in temporary workers invites crime.   A lack of internal safeguards compounds the problem. &quot;Thesmall-business owner tends to put more trust in his employeesand have fewer controls. He may not even see certain signs&quot;of crime, says E. John Keller, a risk-assessment consultantin Southlake, Texas.   The consequences can be dire. Inventory shrinkage averagesabout 1.9% for retailers nationwide, but losses among smallretailers average 2.5% to 3%, with the biggest shareoccurring around Christmas, Mr. Hayes estimates. Other kindsof small businesses face increased risk as well, and mostlack fidelity bonds and other forms of loss insurance.   &quot;Many Fortune 500 companies can afford to take a prettygood hit&quot; from a dishonest employee, says Dennis Dalton, aFremont, Calif., security consultant. &quot;But for many smallercompanies, any hit is catastrophic.&quot;   The risk is highest now. Holiday bills and stress oftenaggravate employees' personal problems, increasing theincentive to steal, says Thomas W. Kulawiak, an audit partnerwith Grant Thornton, accountants and management consultantsbased in Chicago.   After her boyfriend lost his job, an employee for a smallMidwestern insurance company stole $75,000 from her firm oneChristmas to pay the bills and finance his growing drughabit. The worker used customers' checks to cover her theftsfrom the petty cash fund and destroyed the customers' accountstatements to keep them in the dark. Then, in a kind ofpyramid scheme, she hid the fraud by intercepting paymentsfrom other customers and applying them to the deficitaccounts.   Many small businesses shelve loss-prevention programsduring the holidays. &quot;They have a tendency to be caught up inthe Christmas rush, and they feel they're too busy toconcentrate on things like that,&quot; Mr. Hayes says.   Amid the rush, many businesses fail to detect commoncash-register abuses: making fraudulent refunds, voidingtransactions and pocketing the cash, or &quot;sweethearting&quot; --charging a friend or accomplice a sharply reduced price. Whena small, exclusive East Coast formal-wear retailer left oneof its employees in charge of the store, the woman stole$75,000 by voiding customer purchases and falsifyingreceipts.   Lengthened holiday business hours make many smallretailers turn their stores over to seasonal workers in theevening. An inexperienced manager, often a high schoolstudent or a recent graduate, can face heavy peer pressure tohand out free merchandise or cash. &quot;It becomes kind of anearly Christmas,&quot; says Mr. Dalton.   &quot;Backdoor losses&quot; from a warehouse or distribution centercan mushroom over the holidays as well. One small retailerlost $25,000 in men's suits because two unsupervisedwarehouse workers were colluding to prepare false shippinglabels and send merchandise to friends' addresses.   The sheer volume of business associated with the holidayscan mask a multitude of sins. Payoffs by buyers or purchasingagents are often missed in a flood of seasonal gifts andgreetings. &quot;This is the time of year when nice gifts aregoing fast and furious between buyers and vendors,&quot; says JohnKula, head of fraud and security consulting for ArthurAndersen andamp; Co. &quot;At Christmastime, the cash payments getbigger, and the gifts tend to get more substantial. Peoplehave a greater need.&quot;   Dishonest deals struck by purchasing agents earlier in theyear, during the heavy Christmas buying season, often hauntthe small business around Christmas, when &quot;there certainlycan be more of a problem with shoddy merchandise,&quot; says Mr.Dalton. &quot;The trucks may start rolling into the distributioncenter loaded with millions of billiard tables or no-speedbicycles, and the business owner may wonder, `Hey, what'swrong with this picture? Did we really order this stuff?'&quot;   One small automotive-parts distributor lost more than$100,000 before its purchasing agent was caught approving aphony invoice for a rebuilt truck engine. &quot;The engine nevercame in, but he OK'd it anyway,&quot; says Mr. Hayes, who turnedthe case over to prosecutors.   Small businesses are particularly vulnerable because theytend to trust employees more. A small south Florida retailercouldn't believe that a star saleswoman could be causing itsmissing-merchandise problem. She had been &quot;employee of theyear&quot; for three consecutive years. The business owner wasincredulous when the woman admitted to outside investigatorsthat she had given away $900,000 in free shirts to friends,says Read Hayes, a Winter Park, Fla., security consultant.   Small-business owners often assume they know theiremployees better than they do. A vice president in charge ofpurchasing for a family-owned jewelry-store chain in Texaswas arrested by Dallas police for consorting with aprostitute. The employee had been stealing diamonds and usingthem to pay prostitutes and raise cash for drugs. &quot;He used tocome to work high. It should have been a huge red flag&quot; forthe business owners, says Mr. Kula of Arthur Andersen.   When employees have personal problems, many small-businessowners &quot;tend to think in terms of, `What is my obligation?How should I help the employee?' instead of `What should Ilock down? He might be stealing me blind,'&quot; Mr. Kula says.   The pressure on employees during a busy season often makessmall-business executives reluctant to enforce basic rules.One fast-growing New York computer dealer rewarded itsfrazzled employees by reimbursing them for dinner if theyworked late. But the company's chief financial officer hadpaid the controller for hundreds of dollars in dinners henever ate before the business's owner noticed that thecontroller wasn't turning in receipts.   &quot;The controller was working hard, and the CFO didn't wantto hassle him,&quot; says Anthony Morris, a Bostoncomputer-industry strategy consultant.</TEXT></DOC>
