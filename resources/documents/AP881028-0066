The satellite lifted off without a hitch into clear skies lateThursday above the European Space Agency launch site on thenortheastern edge of South America.   It was the 13th successful launch in 13 months for Arianespace,responsible for the European Space Agency's commercial launches.   The satellite reached orbit about 16 minutes after takeoff andquickly separated from the rocket.   About 25 minutes after liftoff, the solar panels opened on thesatellite. It was the stage that had most concerned techniciansafter the failure last year of the West German TV-SAT1 satellite.   For a reason that has yet to be determined, the panels failed toopen on the West German satellite, a sister to the French satelliteunder the joint French-German agreement that was the origin of thesatellite project in 1977.   Officials at the space center described the launch as ``acomplete success.''   The five-channel French satellite will beam television showsdirectly to the home. Previously, satellite signals were picked upby large dishes owned by cable companies and networks that relayedprogramming to viewers.   The satellite, which will be operational by late December, has alifespan of eight years and will sit in geostationary orbit 22,000miles above the Atlantic Ocean.   Its signal will reach viewers from Portugal to the Ural Mountainsof the Soviet Union and from Britain to North Africa, bringingviewers with receiving equipment a better TV picture and stereosound. TDF1 is the first step for Europe toward the new technologyof high-definition television.   It was designed by the French broadcasting authority to bring anincreased number of television channels to 66 millionFrench-speaking viewers in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg,Monaco and a potential audience of 400 million viewers in NorthAfrica.   Simone Veil, a member of the European Parliament and president ofthe European Year of Cinema and Television, called the launch a``formidable success.''   In a message to the head of France's broadcasting authority, Mrs.Veil said the satellite ``turns a new page in the history oftelevision in Europe.''   Critics have said the satellite, developed over a decade at acost of about $250 million, is overpriced and already outmoded.   Since the satellite was designed, advances in technology have putit at a competitive disadvantage against five other satelliteventures scheduled to begin operation before 1990.   Only one of the five channels had been rented officially at thetime of liftoff, by the French cultural network La Sept for artsprogramming.   Industry sources said two more channels were likely to be takenby the highly successful cable movie channel Canal Plus to transmitfamily programming and German-language feature films.   Another transponder might be used to broadcast reruns, mostly ofAmerican television comedies, by the private French network TF1.   To answer the competition, the French government decided in theweeks before liftoff to further subsidize the cost of leasingchannels to operators. Instead of costing $20 million to $22million, the French satellite will now cost about the same as itscompetitor Astra, which leases channels for $6 million to $7 million.   Astra, a medium-power, 16-channel satellite initiated by theLuxembourg government, is scheduled for launch Dec. 9 aboard anAriane rocket. It has already leased most of its channels.   For the moment, only 50,000 satellite dishes exist in all ofEurope and the equipment for receiving signals from the new Frenchsatellite is more expensive than that of the competition.   The French government will be watching the new satellite venturewith particular concern because it has a second $250 millionsatellite scheduled for launch next year as a backup to this one.</TEXT></DOC>
