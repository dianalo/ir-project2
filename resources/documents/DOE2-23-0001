Iodide binding with poly-N-vinylamides isshown. The binding constant K/sub bind/ of iodide for solutions withionic strength equalling 1 which is 12.5, 5.9, and 3.0 l/mol at 292 degK, respectively for PVC, PBP, and PVMA solutions is determined. It isestablished that the increase of local I/sub -/ concentration of I/sub-/ ions and considerable decrease in their mobility are obtained closeto macromolecules of poly-N-vinylamides. For PVP solutions it is foundthat K/sub bind/ increases with decrease of solution ionic strength.IN the methanolic solutions iodide binding with PVP is not found. A modelof the binding mechanism is suggested according to which molecules ofwater hydrated with PVP play an important role in binding. These moleculesserve as a bridge between units of the polymer chain and iodide ions.</TEXT></DOC>
