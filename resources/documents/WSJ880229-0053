The consumer products company said it set the meeting in response to the previously announced request of shareholders who said they intend to nominate Merton Moss, a private investor, and Martin Whitman, chairman of an investment banking firm. The company said the four holders own a 13.7% stake in the company's $2.19 cumulative preference stock.    Separately, Spear, Leeds andamp; Kellogg, a New York-based securities firm, said it nominated Joshua Angel for election to one of two additional board seats at a meeting Wednesday. Voting will be holders of $11.25 convertible preference shares. Mr. Angel is a partner in the New York law firm of Angel andamp; Frankel, which specializes in bankruptcy matters.    Spear Leeds, which holds a 25.07% stake in the company's $11.25 convertible preference stock, previously nominated Timothy Lang for a director, but said it withdrew his nomination in favor of Mr. Angel because of the company's filing for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. </TEXT></DOC>
