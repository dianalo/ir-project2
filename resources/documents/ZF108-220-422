 The goal of OASIS is to keep in mindthat the customer provides the funding as well as thespecifications for a project, then evaluate bids in terms offinancial, technical and managerial considerations.andP;  The majorchange in the way the federal procurement authority, whichpurchases everything from mainframe computers to 286-basedmicrocomputers, operates is that they are much more apt to go withan open systems or generic approach rather than be locked into aproprietary solution from a single vendor.andP;  He also cites anincrease in the demand for such professional services as projectmanagement and software development.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Supply and Services CanadaOffice AutomationGovernment AgencyPurchasing SystemsHardwareInformation SystemsSoftware SelectionVendors.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>IN CONVERSATION CC: There are a number of large office automation projectsbeing procured by OASIS?andM;Westcott: The principle of our operation is, our customer defines therequirement, and provides us a specification of that requirement as well asthe funding.andP;  We have to know that in fact there are funds available toproceed with it.andM;From that point we take those specifications, plus some terms and conditionsthat are normally associated with requests and proposals and then we solicitbids from the private sector to try to meet those requirements.andM;Then we, in conjunction with our customer, will evaluate those bids from afinancial point of view, from a technical point of view, and sometimes from amanagerial point of view, and select a winner.andP;  Then in conjunction with thatwinning vendor we will develop a contract.andM;CC: How does that work with another ministry where they are the onesimplementing the technology?andM;Westcott: At times it's an interesting partnership.andP;  An emerging trend hascome where 15 years ago there were very many proprietary solutions to a givenset of problems.andM;We tended to get locked into proprieary solutions, where you would end upwith a single vendor who would supply a total solution.andP;  But now with thechanges in technology and the fact that things are becoming more generic,we're getting more generic solutions.andM;For instance in the IBM, MVS or VM mainframe world, there are three veryactive vendors who all are capable of supplying the hardware to in fact meetthat requirement: IBM themselves, Hitachi Data Systems and Amdahl.andP;  So wehave competition.andM;What we try to do is work with our customer to develop specifications thatwill allow their needs to be met, but at the same time allow us to get goodcompetition in terms of either performance or value or price, or all threepreferably.andP;  That's very much a partnership between ourselves and ourcustomer.andM;Another example of where we would be working in concert with our customers: agroup of my staff got 13 of the principal ministries to sit around a tableand to define requirements for the MS-DOS/Intel micro line, from the basic PCthrough '286s through '386s through to '486s this year.andM;We managed to get a consensus among the group, that, yes, this is aspecification that we all believe is correct and will deliver what we want interms of value and performance.andM;We then went out to tender with that requirement.andP;  We got the responses, andthen we, in conjunction with our cusotmers, spent something like 21 daysbenchmarking all of the proposed products from all of those vendors.andP;  Theywere very, very strenuous benchmarks, because as I think you are well awarethere is a variety of quality and a variety of deliverables in theMS-DOS-compatible world.andM;As a result of that benchmarking process, approximately 30 per cent of theofferings were rejected as not being suitable in terms of their capabilitiesand deliveries and performance, or in quality.andM;All of the vendors who got rejected were satisfied they knew why they wererejected.andP;  It wasn't a question of us being arbitrary or anything like that.andO;It was very well understood and the vendors appreciated why we weren'tinterested in their products.andM;We then established what we call a standing offer, with all of the winningvendors, that will last to the end of this year.andP;  The resulting business thatwill flow through that whole process, will probably be in the order ofbetween $30 and $40 million.andM;CC: You mentioned winning vendors, is that everybody but the 30 per cent?andM;Westcott: Right.andP;  We're not just picking a vendor, we're trying to get anumber of vendors who have capabilities within a band, so that we have morechoice than just one or two.andP;  Now in this particular case we had 28 differentconfigurations.andP;  We ended up with, in some cases, up to six vendors in agiven category, depending on the category and how the pricing was structured.andM;CC: Twenty-eight configurations?andM;Westcott: It's a fairly complicated world, between the combinations of speed,memory size, operating system, video display, video display card and diskcapacity.andP;  That's how you can end up with that number of combinations.andM;CC: Is there a mainstream machine?andM;Westcott: No.andP;  It's fairly evenly divided.andP;  We are a large buyer.andP;  We are thelargest single buyer I believe, in Canada, of computing equipment, as asingle entity.andM;CC: Are people still buying PC compatibles?andM;Westcott: Some, as opposed to buying '286s or '386s.andP;  Yes, there are some.andO;It's obviously diminishing.andP;  The predominant class now of course is the'286s, but there is a very significant growth of '386 penetration.andM;There's also a significant interest in Unix in the federal government.andP;  Boththe Minister of Transport and National Defence have a very keen interest inUnix, as a counterpoint to OS/2 and Presentation Manager.andM;CC: Tell me aobut DPI (the Data Processing Institute).andM;Westcott: DPI is a wonderful organization.andP;  It really is unique to Ottawa.andO;It was founded in the mid '60s.andP;  It is 100 per cent staffed and run byvolunteer public servants.andP;  It functions primarily as a support organizationto the people who are engaged in data processing in Ottawa.andM;On the calendar each year, there's professional development week, which takesplace in February -- this year it will be from the 19th to the 23rd -- wherethere's up to 30 speakers.andP;  We're very proud of our abilities to draw peoplewho are at the leading end of the technologies around the world.andM;We usually get up to 800 attendees during the week.andP;  We work with the privatesector, they do support us, in terms of sponsoring some of the events that wehave.andM;We also issue some bursaries every year to the local colleges who are in thebusiness of educating people in the information processing field.andP;  Twostudents a year get bursaries fro DPI to support their educationalactivities.andP;  It's a great institution.andM;CC: DPI has a membership of?andM;Westcott: About eight to nine hundred.andP;  But the mix who attend theconferences is an interesting mix because it's not just DPI members.andP;  We alsoget people from the private sector who come.andM;Increasingly we get more and more people who come from the non-traditionaldata processing domains, people who are coming from either the user communityor from the management community.andM;Mind you, we're changing the program mix as well.andP;  We're trying to expand thehorizon beyond the normal sort of raised floor....andM;The nature of the business, of course has changed dramatically since theearly days.andM;Although we're still buying an awful lot of mainframes, an awful lot of DASD,telecommunications equipment, terminals, lines and that sort of thing, thereis a makred increase in the amount of service requirements that we have toprocure on behalf of the government, professional services, projectmanagement services, software development services, that is on the increase.andM;Then obviously the utilization of micros and LANs.andP;  LANs are now becomingmore and more evident.andM;CC: How much of your acquisition is actually Ottawa-Hull versus the rest ofthe country?andM;Westcott: One has to be careful with this.andP;  You have to realize that the vastmajority of the information systems infrastructure in government is based inOttawa.andM;So as a result, an awful lot of the supporting services and supportingcapability and equipment naturally flows in Ottawa.andM;It's very difficult to profile it.andP;  But because organizations like NationalDefence are quite distributed across the country in terms of their bases,they have a fair amount of distributed hardware across the country.andM;Fisheries and Oceans is quite a distributed organization.andP;  Agriculture Canadais a fairly distributed organization as well.andP;  But the project management andthe overall systems responsibility is resident in Ottawa.andM;There's really two major exceptions; one is the Atmospheric EnvironmentServices, which is based in Toronto, and Veterans Affairs, which is based inCharlottetown.andP;  Their two systems organizations are based outside of Ottawa.andM;OASISandM;The Office Automation, Services and Information Systems part of Supply andServices Canada is the biggest buyer of information technology products inthe country.andM;It is the procurement agency on behalf of the federal government, buyign allof its information systems technologies, excluding embedded systems such asweapons systems, and crown agencies such as Canada Post and Air Canada.andM;The Procurement Operations Branch buys approximately $1 billion per year ofinformation systems, services and office automation equipment, and officeproducts such as pens, papers, pencils and ergonomic furnishings.andM;Grant C. Westcott is the director of the Procurement Operations Branch forOffice Automation, Services and Inforamtion Systems.andP;  He has a Master ofScience degree in management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technologyand an undergraduate diploma in electronic engineering from the University ofLondon.andM;Westcott had private sector experience in the information systems field inToronto with Stedmans and with Bordens Canada prior to joining the civilservice 17 years ago.andP;  He has been in the information systems field since hisearly 20s, and in the procurement field of information systems for the lastthre years.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
