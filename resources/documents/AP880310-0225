Gladson, assistant administrator forAfrica of the Agency for International Development.   He listed as the ``most obvious'' factors:   _internal strife and civil wars.   _policies that fail to give incentives to farmers to grow enoughfood.   _poorly developed infrastructure, such as roads and railroads.   _governments incapable of coordinating relief.   Gladson's testimony was prepared for a hearing by the HouseSelect Committee on Hunger and the Foreign Affairs subcommitteethat deals with Africa. The hearing dealt with the crisis inAngola, Mozambique, Ethiopia and Sudan.   ``Even in the best of times, Ethiopia cannot feed itself withits current policies,'' said Roy Stacy, deputy assistant secretaryof state for Africa.   ``The U.S. government alone spent over $600 million foremergency aid to save lives, but without incentive farming policiessuch assistance does not result in recovery and provides littleresistance to the next drought,'' he said.   According to the hunger committee, a drought in Ethiopia hasagain resulted in crop failures and a food deficit of 1.3 millionmetric tons, with 5.2 million to 8 million people at risk. It saidthe U.S. government has provided more than $100 million in aid inthe current crisis.   The administration view was endorsed by Rep. Tony Roth, R-Wis.   ``Ethiopia, Mozambique and Angola _ is there some reason thatMother Nature has singled out these three countries by chance? Idon't think so,'' he said.   ``All of these countries share one other common trait: theirdisastrous agricultural yields can be directly attributed to thefailures of collectivized farming and to a patent disegard forhuman life,'' he said.   All three have communist governments.   He complained that a proposed resolution on famine relief,introduced by Rep. Tony P. Hall, D-Ohio, and Mickey Leland,D-Texas, contained no condemnation of the Ethiopian government ofMengistu Haile-Mariam for withholding food as a means of combattingrebel forces.   He also criticized the proposed resolution for suggesting thatthe U.S. government prevent refugees from crossing borders or goinginto relief camps.   ``It seems to me altogether inappropriate for it to to be apolicy of the U.S. government to prevent people from voting withtheir feet and escaping from a brutal dictatorship,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
