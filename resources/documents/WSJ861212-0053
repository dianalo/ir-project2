Chandler van Orman, executive director of the Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries, wouldn't comment on the group's specific recommendations, but said the panel is concerned that relatively low salaries have become a disincentive to government service.    Congressional aides and other sources said they expected the commission to recommend that the annual salary for most legislators be increased to $97,500 from $75,100. Recommended pay increases for executive branch officials and judges are estimated to be more than 25%. The commission's recommendation was first reported in the Washington Post.    The president usually revises the recommendations of the commission, which is organized every four years, and sends them to Congress as part of his proposed budget. But substantial pay increases are more likely to take effect this time than in previous years.    The president's salary proposal will go into effect automatically unless both houses of Congress pass a bill of disapproval and send it to the president for his signature. </TEXT></DOC>
