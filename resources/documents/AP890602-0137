(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Consultant William L. Parkin and theformer Navy engineer he bribed were given 26-month prison termsFriday for illegally scheming to help two companies get lucrativePentagon contracts.   Parkin, 65, and Stuart E. Berlin, 51, were each fined $25,000and ordered to serve two years of supervised probation followingtheir release from prison. They each could have received up to 25years in prison and fined $750,000.   Berlin, who choked back sobs before U.S. District Judge ClaudeHilton imposed the sentence, said his crime was ``the worst mistakethat I ever made in my life.'' He added: ``The last year has been aliving hell for me.''   The judge said both defendants, who have cooperated with theJustice Department's ``Operation Ill Wind'' investigation ofPentagon procurement fraud since pleading guilty, could serve theirtime in minimum-security prisons.   Parkin pleaded guilty to charges that he bribed Berlin toprovide secret Navy bid information that would help TeledyneIndustries Inc. and Hazeltine Corp. of Long Island, N.Y., obtainlucrative contracts to sell electronic equipment to the Pentagon.   Berlin, who admitted from the witness stand in April that hetook thousands of dollars in bribes while he worked for the Navy,was sentenced for taking nearly $5,000 in bribes in return forgiving Parkin the bid information.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica acknowledged that bothmen, who had testified at the trial of two Teledyne executives whowere convicted for their roles in the conspiracy, are cooperatingwith the Justice Department's investigation.   Aronica said Berlin's receipt of bribes ``is perhaps the mostserious offense that a government official can commit. It is aviolation of the public trust. It is a corruption that is motivatedby nothing more than his own greed.''   Parkin's role ``as front man and the individual to whom moneywas paid kept the conspiracy afloat,'' Aronica said. The prosecutorsaid ``corrupting of a public official is reprehensible, especiallyfor a former government official.''   Parkin, himself a former Navy employee, admitted that he hadtaken $50,000 in bribes over a 10-year period when he worked forthe Defense Department.   Court documents indicate that after opening a private consultingbusiness in 1983, Parkin became the center of a massive briberyscheme involving efforts to trade and sell confidential Pentagoninformation to help companies bid on contracts.   Aronica told the judge that Parkin arranged to be paid $272,000in consulting fees from Teledyne and Hazeltine that he agreed tosplit with Berlin and others to obtain confidential bid information.   Defense attorney Leonard Greenbaum urged the judge to take intoaccount that Berlin received less than his share of the bribe moneybecause he was ``shortchanged at the outset'' by Parkin and FredLackner.   Lackner, a Los Angeles defense consultant, is awaitingsentencing for his role as go-between from Parkin to Berlin.   ``What he got was less than $5,000,'' Greenbaum said.   Parkin and Lackner agreed not to tell Berlin the full amount ofthe money they were to split, thereby arranging to take largershares for themselves, according to their court testimony in April.   Greenbaum also suggested that Berlin actually saved thetaxpayers money because the information he passed along toHazeltine prompted the company to lower its bid for a Navyelectronics contract by $70 million.   Hazeltine, a subsidiary of Emerson Electric Co. of St. Louis,and two of its officers pleaded guilty earlier this year toparticipating in the conspiracy. The company paid nearly $2 millionin penalties.   Teledyne, based in Newbury Park, Calif., also pleaded guilty,agreeing to pay $4.3 million in penalties and forfeit $4 million infuture profits on a contract.   Berlin, Parkin and Lackner were witnesses at the April trial atwhich two Teledyne executives, George H. Kaub and Eugene R.Sullivan, were convicted of conspiracy and wire fraud. The two arescheduled to be sentenced next Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
