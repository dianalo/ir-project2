So far this year, the dollar has survived major monetary nations' aggressive efforts to weaken it. But central banks aren't expected to stand back and let the dollar take flight to sharply higher levels.    &quot;They're definitely not going to throw in the towel. They're going to keep fighting it,&quot; says Lawrence Krohn, an international economist at Shearson Lehman Hutton.    From the looks of things, central banks may be on the battlefield for some time.    Currency analysts say the dollar may break through major resistance at two marks and 150 yen shortly, as it continues to draw strength from the healthy pace of U.S. economic growth and the relatively high U.S. interest rates that lure capital flows to dollar-denominated investments.    In late afternoon New York trading Friday, the dollar was at 1.9950 marks, up from 1.9800 marks late Thursday, and at 147.20 yen, up from 146.63 yen. Sterling was at $1.5375, down from $1.5512.    In Tokyo Monday, the U.S. currency was trading lower late in the morning following intervention by the Bank of Japan.    After the intervention pushed the dollar to around 147.45 yen, it recovered and fluctuated at levels just below the opening quote of 147.75 yen; that was up from Tokyo's Friday close of 146.62 yen.    The dollar remains well above ranges of 1.70-1.90 marks and 120-140 yen, which are the bands the major monetary nations are widely believed to consider sufficient for a stable foreign-exchange market and the correction of global trade imbalances. But officials from major industrial nations are set to meet in Paris Wednesday at the headquarters of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and some currency analysts say the group may use the gathering as a chance to get its intervention act together.    Those nations, known as the G-10 although there are 11, are the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Sweden and the Netherlands. Officials from major monetary nations also will meet in Washington at the end of the month.    &quot;Any time they get together, they might convince everybody that the program is not working as well as it could be&quot; to hold the dollar down, says Charles Daley, chief dealer at First Pennsylvania Bank, Philadelphia.    &quot;We're worried about them being even more serious this time {about selling dollars}. The fear is there,&quot; he adds.    The Bank of Japan was seen selling dollars in Tokyo Friday around 146.75 yen, and traders suspect the Federal Reserve unloaded dollars secretly in New York at around 146.40 yen and 1.9800 marks.    On New York's Commodity Exchange Friday, gold for current delivery settled at $359.40 an ounce, down 80 cents. Estimated volume was a light two million ounces.    In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at $357.75 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
