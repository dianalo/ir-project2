The Commerce Department said that spending on public and privatebuilding projects declined by 0.3 percent in March, following evenlarger declines of 0.8 percent in February and 0.7 percent inJanuary.   The February decline represented a sharp revision from theoriginal report a month ago, when the government had reported thatconstruction spending was unchanged from the January level.   The three consecutive declines pushed activity down to aseasonally adjusted annual rate of $413.5 billion.   It marked the longest string of setbacks since five months ofdeclines from February through June of 1981, right before the startof the 1981-82 recession.   Construction, because of its sensitivity to high interest rates,has often been one of the sectors leading the country into adownturn.   Michael Sumichrast, an economist and publisher of a constructionnewsletter, said that history could well repeat itself unless theFederal Reserve soon relents and stops pushing interest rates up inan effort to fight inflation.   Economists have been looking for building activity to be weakthis year because of the Fed's campaign to push interest rateshigher as a way of fighting inflation by dampening economicactivity.   ``There is no strength anywhere in construction,'' Sumichrastsaid. ``We have problems with overbuilding, high interest rates anda sharp run-up in prices of single-family homes.''   The weakness in March resulted from a 9.1 percent plunge inpublic construction, which fell to an annual rate of $74.1 billion.Much of that decline reflected an 18.8 percent drop in spending forhighways and streets, the biggest government category.   Construction of new housing units was down as well, dropping 1.4percent to an annual rate of $143.3 billion. Spending onsingle-family homes fell by 1.7 percent to an annual rate of $120.1billion while multi-family construction was up 0.9 percent to arate of $23.3 billion.   Non-residential construction rose by 4.1 percent to an annualrate of $101.9 billion, reflecting strength in factoryconstruction, which surged by 12.1 percent and hotel construction,which was up 7 percent.   But Sumichrast said he believed this was a temporary spurt inactivity. For the year as a whole, he predicted that constructionin the non-residential category would drop by about 6 percent fromthe 1988 level, led by continued weakness in office construction.</TEXT></DOC>
