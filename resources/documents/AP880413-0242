At a news conference, Brady called the law ``one small step formankind, one giant step for Maryland.''   On Monday, the Maryland legislature passed a law that would makeit the first state to ban the sale of cheap handguns known asSaturday Night Specials. Gov. William Donald Schaefer has promisedto sign the legislation.   Brady's wife, Sarah, had campaigned vigorously for passage ofthe bill and called it ``a good first step.'' She said Tuesday shehoped other states will follow Maryland's example.   ``It's a wonderful victory for advocates of gun control,'' saidMrs. Brady, who called the cheap handguns the ``No. 1 crime gun inthe country.''   Mrs. Brady told legislators at a hearing earlier this year thata $29 handgun that would be banned under the Maryland law was usedby John W. Hinckley Jr. in his 1981 assassination attempt thatwounded the president and left her husband partly disabled.   Brady has held on to the title of press secretary despite hisinjury and visits the office about once a week.   The bill directs the governor to create a state Handgun RosterBoard headed by the state police superintendent. The nine-memberboard will list guns that can be sold in Maryland and will berequired to withhold approval of:   _Guns that are inaccurate, poorly made, easily concealed andmanufactured of cheap materials.   _Guns made mostly of plastic or ceramic materials that can't bereadily detected by security systems at airports and publicbuildings.   _Guns that have had the manufacturer's serial number obliteratedor altered.   The bill provides fines of $2,500 to $10,000 for anyone whosells guns not on the approved list. It will be illegal only tosell the weapons, not to own them.   Illinois, Hawaii, South Carolina and Minnesota have laws thatban guns based on the melting point of the metal, according to thelobbying group Handgun Control Inc. Guns with lower melting pointsare of poorer quality and thus cheaper.   However, both the National Rifle Association and Handgun Controlsaid no state regulates guns on the basis of accuracy, ease ofconcealment, plastic or ceramic construction or the othercharacteristics in the Maryland law.   ``Clearly, this is going to add some impetus to other statesconsidering gun control laws. This is an example we'll be taking toother states,'' said Michael Beard, executive director of theNational Coalition to Ban Handguns.   ``I'm hoping Congress will look at what Maryland did,'' saidAttorney General J. Joseph Curran.``That's where this action isneeded.''   But an NRA representative said he feared the spread of similarlegislation.   ``I just hope it's not a trend-setting thing where a lot ofstates start setting up boards,'' said NRA liaison Charles H.Cunningham after the Senate's 35-10 vote Saturday. The House passedthe bill 95-41 Monday.   The ban on the sale of Saturday Night Specials will take effectJan. 1, 1990. The board will be required to prepare a list ofapproved guns by July 1, 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
