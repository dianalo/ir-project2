In arguments scheduled Wednesday before the court, DanielHolland's lawyers plan to argue that white defendants should beaccorded the same constitutional right granted to blacks tochallenge racial bias during jury selection.   Prosecutors say race was not an issue and contend that Holland'scase could lead to unworkable quotas for juries.   An all-white jury in the suburban Des Plaines branch of CookCounty Circuit Court convicted Holland in 1981 on charges of rape,sexual assault, kidnapping and armed robbery in the abduction of a17-year-old girl and her boyfriend.   The victims were driving home from a party when their car had aflat tire. Holland offered them a ride, then pulled a knife,threatened the girl and ordered the boyfriend out of the car,according to court documents.   Holland then drove to a Des Plaines apartment complex, raped thegirl several times and took about $60 before fleeing, the documentsshow.   He was arrested later that morning and tried by a jury selectedfrom a pool of about 40 people, two of whom were black.   Holland's conviction was overturned on other grounds by theIllinois Appellate Court, but reinstated later by the state SupremeCourt.   His appeal puts the spotlight on a legal tradition that allowslawyers to reject a certain number of potential jurors withoutgiving a reason, using what are called peremptory challenges.   In Holland's case, prosecutors dimissed the two blacks and eightother people without a reason, but said race was not an issue.   Prosecutors are barred from using peremptory challenges toexclude blacks from juries for racial reasons under a 1986 SupremeCourt decision. But the high court has held that only minoritieshave a right to challenge racial bias during jury selection.   ``White defendants have no comparable weapon to fight racialbigotry,'' Donald Honchell, an attorney for Holland, wrote inarguments filed with the U.S. Supreme Court. ``There can be noimage of a fair jury in the eyes of the community if the process ofselecting it sanctions discrimination.''   Inge Fryklund, supervisor of criminal appeals for the state'sattorney's office, contends that Holland's lawyers are trying totwist the constitutional right to an impartial jury into a mandatethat all juries be representative of communities from which theyare selected.   That would be ``unsound, unworkable and unnecessary,'' Ms.Fryklund argues.</TEXT></DOC>
