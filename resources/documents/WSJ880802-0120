Eurostat didn't give figures for overall EC growth during the period, but it said France and West Germany, the two biggest economies, experienced annual growth rates of 4.5% and 5.6%, respectively, in the first quarter.    Britain experienced a modest growth rate of 0.2%, mainly because of a steep drop in exports, Eurostat said.    By comparison, first-quarter growth in the U.S. amounted to an annual rate of 3.6% and in Japan it reached 10.8%, Eurostat said.    The EC economy is expected to grow by about 2.5% for all of 1988, it said.    Unemployment in the EC fell a small 0.4% in the year to June, Eurostat said, but the trend in the member states was mixed. Some countries, such as Britain, France and Spain, achieved lower jobless rates while others, like West Germany and Italy, experienced rising unemployment.    The agency also said that the EC's current-account surplus narrowed to an estimated 34 billion ECUs ($37.7 billion) in 1987 from 52 billion ECUs the previous year, mainly because of a 13 billion ECU drop in the EC's trade surplus. The current account measures trade in goods and services, as well as certain unilateral transfers. </TEXT></DOC>
