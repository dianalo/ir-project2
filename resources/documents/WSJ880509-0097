The doctor has prescribed Valium -- but the patient walks out with Equanil, an entirely different tranquilizer.    The switch is entirely proper, legal and ethical, at least in the state of Washington. There, physicians and retail druggists are allowed to practice what the medical community calls therapeutic substitution. It's a controversial method of dispensing prescription drugs that is increasingly used in the nation's health institutions. And although Washington is currently the only state where therapeutic substitution is permitted at the local-pharmacy level, pressures are building that would bring the practice to retail pharmacies across the country.    An outgrowth of generic substitution, where a less-expensive generic drug is substituted for a prescribed brand-name drug, therapeutic substitution allows a pharmacist to replace a prescribed drug with a different class or family of medication. Usually, the substitute costs less. And the pharmacist's decision, depending on critics' and proponents' various interpretations of the practice, may be made with or without the physician's direct approval. (In the state of Washington, such approval is a prerequisite.)    Therapeutic substitution is already practiced in many hospitals under strict controls. But the idea is now spilling over into health-maintenance organizations, nursing homes and other managed-care facilities. The reason: persistent pressure to cut costs in the $30 billion-a-year prescription-drug business. Health professionals believe that such pressure, combined with pharmacists' desire to play a bigger role in patient care, is pushing therapeutic substitution toward corner drugstores nationwide.    &quot;As long as the country moves down the track of price-dictated health care, therapeutic substitution will be high on the agenda,&quot; says Henri Manasse, dean of the College of Pharmacy at the University of Illinois.    That alarms many people in the healthcare industry and could have far-reaching effects. Doctors, for example, fear that widespread altering of prescriptions will endanger patients and threaten physicians' prerogatives.    Drug makers worry that therapeutic substitution could erode incentives to develop and market new drugs. Insurers, while attracted to the potential cost savings, worry about liability problems. And pharmacists themselves question the wisdom of stepping out of their traditional -- and relatively safe -- role as suppliers of medication.    &quot;No issue before medicine today has greater implications than therapeutic substitution,&quot; says Paul L. Doering, an associate professor at the University of Florida's College of Pharmacy.    Perhaps the one setting where therapeutic substitution doesn't stir heated debate is in hospitals. Usually, a hospital's substitution system is based on a &quot;formulary,&quot; a list approved by a hospital committee that specifies when one drug will be replaced by another.    Although doctors may not always be enamored of such lists, they have come to accept them for several reasons: Physicians can help determine formularies through the hospital committee; they are usually aware of substitutions before they are made; and hospitals strictly control how substitutes are administered. Hospitals, meanwhile, have come to accept formularies for a much simpler reason: They save money.    At the Group Health Cooperative Central Hospital in Olympia, Wash., for example, a doctor's order for Feldene, an arthritis drug that costs about $1 a pill, would likely be changed to ibuprofen, the generic name of a different class of medication -- but one that also helps arthritics and that costs only about 12 cents a pill.    &quot;The idea is to get the best pharmaceutical at the lowest possible cost,&quot; says Marvin Chamberlain, director of the Olympia hospital's pharmacy and materials management. Therapeutic substitutions, he says, have helped his hospital cut its annual pharmaceutical costs by about 10%, or $1.5 million.    Such savings haven't been lost on HMOs and other managed-care facilities. HMOs complain that their pharmacies are swamped by &quot;me-too&quot; drugs, slightly different versions of one successful product. Stocking sizable amounts of medication means sizable costs.    As a consequence, almost one-third of HMO pharmacy plans now allow therapeutic substitution, says Prof. Doering at the University of Florida; five years ago, he says, the practice was virtually unheard of at HMOs.    &quot;As long as we can get the same therapeutic effect, there's no need to carry three or four drugs that do the same thing,&quot; says Lee Lich, president of Blue Care Network Health Central, an HMO in central Michigan that now has 22 therapeutic substitutions on its formulary. For example, rather than stock two similarly effective antibiotics -- Keflex and Velosef -- Blue Care usually carries just one: the one that costs less at a given time.    That philosophy, Mr. Lich says, helped Blue Care's four medical centers save about $1 million in pharmaceutical costs last year. It also helped patients, he says. &quot;Physicians don't have time to look at the price of things. A pharmacist has a responsibility to patients to consider the economics of prescribing drugs.&quot;    Pharmacists acknowledge those economic responsibilities. But many also say they are lining up behind therapeutic substitution for a much more personal reason: It may be their best opportunity to play a bigger role in patient care.    Few pharmacists say they want to prescribe drugs or change prescriptions at random. But many say they want to work more closely with doctors to evaluate and, if necessary, modify a patient's drug therapy. Indeed, a recent survey showed that three-quarters of retail pharmacists said they should be allowed to practice therapeutic interchange.    &quot;How can you question a pharmacist's ability to make a therapeutic exchange in a local setting when they're already making these decisions in hospitals?&quot; asks Charles G. Green, a 31-year-old pharmacist and doctor of pharmacology in Monroe, Ga. &quot;At some point, pharmacists have to use their training; they have to make independent decisions.&quot;    Among opponents of therapeutic substitution, such talk amounts to heresy. Doctors in particular, while acknowledging the benefits of substitution in tightly controlled settings, say the system can't work in the corner pharmacy.    &quot;It's pure and simple quality control&quot; that dictates against therapeutic substitution for outside a hospital, says Roy Schwarz, a physician and assistant executive vice president for medical education and science at the American Medical Association. He explains that while an adverse reaction to a therapeutic substitution would be detected immediately in a hospital, the problem wouldn't be caught so quickly with an outpatient.    Many physicians and health-care officials also fault the notion that therapeutic substitution is simply a natural extension of generic substitution and, therefore, just as safe. The latter practice, they argue, still poses problems for some patients-for example, epileptics, who have had adverse reactions to generic substitutes for prescription drugs. And while there are no studies showing that therapeutic substitutions have harmed patients, opponents are quick to speculate how changes in prescriptions would invite disaster.    The National Pharmaceutical Council, an association of pharmaceutical manufacturers, provides this hypothetical example: An elderly woman develops a severe infection in her urinary tract, which her doctor determines is caused by a bacterium called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The doctor prescribes a particular antibiotic, but the pharmacist substitutes a less-expensive drug that is also used to fight urinary-tract infections. The substitute, however, turns out to be ineffective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The infection spreads rapidly, and the woman goes into shock and dies.    &quot;With certain patient populations, like the elderly, switching medication&quot; can quickly cause serious problems, says Richard Levy, vice president for scientific affairs at the Pharmaceutical Council.    Some doctors -- and many pharmacists -- also see a political issue in switching drugs: a threat to doctors' status. &quot;Physicians fear that allowing pharmacists on to the health-care team means a loss of power and prestige,&quot; says George Perchak, a pharmacist in Stony Point, N.Y.    Critics of therapeutic substitution say the potential for abuse should -- and will -- prevent it from spreading to retail pharmacies. Indeed, medical groups and drugmakers in Wisconsin, Iowa California and Oregon have helped defeat legislation that would have expanded druggists' ability to practice therapeutic substitution   But other members of the health industry say that economic pressures will likely cause the practice to spread. Jim Mitchell, who owns two pharmacies in northwest Washington, says: &quot;The insurance companies and the federal government are going to eventually demand it.&quot;    ---                  The Pharmacists Vote &quot;Yes&quot;   When asked whether and where they should be allowed to practice therapeutic substitution (substituting a prescribed drug with a different type of medication), these percentages of surveyed pharmacists said:    Yes, in a retail setting with a doctor's consent    50%    Yes, in any setting with or without consent         22%    Yes, but only in an institution                     17%    No, whatever the setting                            11%   When asked whethr they were qualified to practice therapeutic substitution, these percentages of surveyed pharmacists said:                                          Yes           No    Institutionsal pharmacists            87%           13%    Independent pharmacists               80%           20%    Chain pharmacists                     79%           21%    Source: American Druggist magazine</TEXT></DOC>
