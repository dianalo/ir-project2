(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Legislature today overwhelminglyapproved a bill aimed at doing away with a century-old countypurchasing system the FBI found was rife with corruption.   The House passed the bill 111-7 and the Senate 50-0. It now goesto Gov. Ray Mabus, who had hailed the measure as ``a tremendousvictory against corruption and for effective government.''   ``For the first time, the government of the state of Mississippiis on record for honest and efficient government,'' Mabus saidafter the legislation won final approval.   Passage came on the seventh day of a special session called byMabus in response to an FBI probe of purchasing practices thatresulted in the arrest of 56 supervisors in 25 counties on chargesranging from mail fraud to extortion.   The Legislature had failed in this year's regular session toagree on anti-corruption legislation.   The bill would require counties to adopt central purchasingsystems, some form of which already exists in 22 of the state's 82counties, but leaves in voters' hands exactly how far thereorganization should go.   Currently, county supervisors oversee all purchasing in theirdistricts. The new system would give an appointed administratorpower over day-to-day purchasing for the entire county, whilekeeping policy in the hands of supervisors.   However, the bill gives voters in each county the right to vetoby referendum the centralizing of road projects _ by far thebiggest purchasing projects at the county level.   As state auditor for the four years preceding his election asgovernor in 1987, Mabus assisted the FBI in its investigation. Ofthe 56 supervisors charged, 42 have pleaded guilty, six have beenconvicted and one has been acquitted.</TEXT></DOC>
