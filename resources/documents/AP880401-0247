Meese said he was ``gratified by the action and the statement''of the independent counsel and that he would not step aside.   ``It is certainly my intent to carry on my duties as long as thepresident wants me to,'' the embattled attorney general told a newsconference.   McKay said his report was an interim one and that hisinvestigation was continuing.   ``The grand jury's investigation is not yet complete as to'' thepipeline probe, the telephone stocks and ``other matters, and willcontinue at least through the end of April,'' McKay's statementsaid. A source close to McKay's investigation would not providedetails of these matters, but said they were all felony cases.   The grand jury is expected this month to hear testimony fromMeese, his wife, Ursula, and U.S. Circuit Judge Douglas H.Ginsburg, former head of the Justice Department's anti-trustdivision that handled the breakup of American Telephone andamp; TelegraphCo. while Meese held telephone stock.   Even though McKay's announcement was an interim report, it wasan enormous boost to Meese, who has been reeling from bipartisancalls in Congress for him to quit in the wake of the resignationsTuesday of two of his top aides.   McKay told a news conference that he decided to issue hisstatement on Friday ``without any outside consultation.'' But heacknowledged that Meese's attorney has asked several times for sucha public statement, including ``quite recently.''   A source close to McKay said Meese's attorneys ``have known ofthis decision for a period of time.'' The source said they arguedMcKay should tell the public as well because ``we know it and youknow it.''   This source said of McKay, ``He's concerned about the fairnessfactor. ... He didn't want people speculating about what he wouldor would not do with respect to these matters.''   The source said McKay could be reappointed or retain hisappointment to deal with any evidence that might surface after thegrand jury is dismissed. McKay's staff is debating whether to sayin his public report that he might have obtained an indictment butdid not do so because he was uncertain of winning a conviction, thesource said.   Several key figures in the criminal investigation of Meese,including his longtime friend, E. Robert Wallach and Meese's formerfinancial manager, W. Franklyn Chinn, have refused to cooperatewith McKay's inquiry. Wallach and Chinn are under indictment in theWedtech scandal.   The aides who stepped down Tuesday were concerned that Meese'slegal problems _ he has been under criminal investigation fornearly 11 months _ are hurting the Justice Department's operationsand image.   Among those who resigned was Assistant Attorney General WilliamWeld, who oversaw all federal criminal investigations, and DeputyAttorney General Arnold Burns.   Meese had planned to announce replacements for Burns, Weld anddeparting Associate Attorney General Stephen Trott, but theannouncement was called off at the last minute without explanation.   The replacement for Burns was expected to be Arlin Adams, aformer U.S. Circuit judge in Philadelphia, department sources said.The replacement for Wells is to be James Knapp, a deputy in theJustice Department's tax division who formerly worked in thecriminal division. The replacement for Trott is to be FrancisKeating, an assistant treasury secretary for enforcement.   Meese would not discuss in detail the reasons why the two topaides left, claiming his conversations with them were confidential.   But he did say that ``there were some basic differences''between Burns, Weld and the attorney general ``as to the effectthat recent events had on the department ... in part they were thefact that there was an independent counsel investigation.''   Meese told reporters that for him to resign would be``incompatible with the actual state of affairs'' and he cited``broad support'' from law enforcement officials, from within theadministration ``at the highest level'' and from members ofCongress.   The White House declined comment on McKay and Meese'sstatements. And after President Reagan arrived at his mountaintopranch near Santa Barbara, Deputy Press Secretary Leslye Arsht saidonly that ``the president was notified by phone in the air. We haveno reaction. He has always said he has confidence in Meese.''   In an interview taped for broadcast Friday night on ABC-TV's``20@20'' program, Meese said he did not feel he was hurting thepresident, but that if he thought he was, he would resign.   ``If at any point, I felt that it was an embarrassment to thepresident, or an embarrassment to the department, I would notrigidly stand and stay here just for the purpose of staying here,''Meese told interviewer Barbara Walters.   ``I've had people from literally all over the country calling meto say, `You owe it to the Justice Department, to the president, tohang in there. ... You owe it to stay, and not give in to the lynchmob.'''   Asked who the lynch mob was, he said, ``Certainly some aspectsof the press.''   He said the Justice Department's problems were ``all of thefalse statements and false accusations on the outside. And I thinkit would be wrong if I, in effect, capitulated to what thepresident has called a lynch mob. I think that would be far worse.I think it's very important if we're gonna make government safe forpublic officials, that no person should be able to be hounded outof office by false accusations, by incessant media barrages, manyof them based on distortions and falsehoods, or by politicalattacks.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
