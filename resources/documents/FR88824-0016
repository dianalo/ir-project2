This regulation limits the availabilityof special refugee assistance in order to reduce Federal costs and encouragerefugees to seek early employment.A proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of October 19, 1987 (52 FR 38795). Public commentswere received through December 3, 1987, and have been carefully considered.No changes have been made in the content of this final rule as a resultof the comments received.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>October 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Office of Refugee Resettlement, Family Support Administration,Department of Health and Human Services, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, 6th Floor,SW., Washington, DC 20447.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Philip A. Holman, (202) 252-4563.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Current regulations at 45 CFR 400.202 through 400.204 provide for Federalrefugee funding, subject to the availability of funds, to be provided toStates for cash and medical assistance for eligible refugees during theirfirst 36 months in the United States. Such funding is provided to Statesfor the non-Federal share of assistance if the refugee is eligible forthe programs of aid to families with dependent children (AFDC), fostercare maintenance payments under title IV-E of the Social Security Act,supplemental security income (SSI), adult assistance in the territories,and medical assistance (Medicaid) under title XIX of the Social SecurityAct.Current regulations also provide for Federal refugee funding, subject tothe availability of funds, for a special program of refugee cash assistance(RCA) and refugee medical assistance (RMA) during a refugee's first 18months in the U.S. and for the cost of general assistance (GA), includingGA medical assistance (GMA), provided to eligible refugees under a Stateor local GA/GMA program during a refugee's second 18 months.The RCA and RMA programs assist those refugees whose economic needs areequivalent to the economic needs required in a State's AFDC program butwho do not meet the AFDC family-composition requirements or the SSI ageor disability requirements.Prior to 1982, RCA and RMA were available during an eligible refugee'sfirst 36 months in the U.S. An interim final regulation published March12, 1982 (at 47 FR 10841) reduced the period to the current 18 months.After the first 18 months, such refugees may seek assistance under a regular,ongoing State or local GA or GMA program. The 1982 regulation providedfor Federal refugee funds to cover the cost of GA and GMA during a refugee'smonths 19-36 so that overall State costs of providing cash and medicalassistance to refugees during their first 36 months in the U.S. would continueto be fully federally funded.Effective March 1, 1986, this 36-month period was reduced to 31 monthsin order to implement the fiscal reductions imposed under Pub. L. 99-177,the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings).Effective February 1, 1988, the 31-month period was further reduced to24 months based on the funds available for cash and medical assistanceunder Pub. L. 100-202, the FY 1988 Continuing Resolution, which was enactedDecember 22, 1987.Thus, under current law and available appropriations, the entire cost ofrefugee cash and medical assistance is borne by the Federal Governmentduring a refugee's first 24 months in the United States.(None of the time-limits cited above apply to funding for assistance andservices for unaccompanied minors under 45 CFR 400.205, nor is such fundingaffected by this rule.)<ITAG tagnum="84">Statutory Authority</ITAG>Section 412(a)(9) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1522(a)(9))authorizes the Secretary of HHS to issue regulations needed to carry outthe refugee resettlement program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Description of the Regulation</ITAG>Through this regulation, the Department is reducing the duration of thespecial programs of refugee cash assistance (RCA) and refugee medical assistance(RMA) from 18 months to 12 months_a 6-month decrease. This change is expectedto result in net savings of approximately $14 million in FY 1989.This reduction in the duration of RCA and RMA has the following purposes:a. To provide refugees with stronger incentives to gain employment andbecome self-sufficient as rapidly as possible after their arrival in theUnited States.b. To reduce the likelihood of unnecessary welfare dependency resultingfrom extended periods of special support.c. To reduce Federal expenditures to help meet the objectives of the BalancedBudget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.d. To reduce the degree of special treatment afforded to refugees, whichresults in unequal treatment among low-income populations.e. To reduce total refugee welfare costs while continuing to relieve Statesof the cost of cash and medical assistance provided to refugees duringtheir initial period in the U.S. Under this rule, RCA and RMA are available only during an eligible refugee'sfirst 12 months in the U.S. Such refugees who continue to be needy afterthe first 12 months can seek assistance under a GA or GMA program beginningin their 13th month rather than in their 19th month as at present. Since,under this rule, Federal refugee funding for GA/GMA begins with a refugee's13th month, no added financial burden occurs to States or localities ascompared to the present policy of funding RCA/RMA during a refugee's first18 months and GA/GMA beginning with a refugee's 19th month.The extent of refugee eligibility for assistance, however, is affectedby this reduction in RCA/RMA from 18 to 12 months. Since the RCA/RMA programsare generally more comprehensive than existing State or local GA/GMA programs,the assistance available to refugees who do not qualify for AFDC, SSI,or Medicaid is reduced beginning with the 13th month rather than the 19thmonth. It is, in part, this difference in coverage between RCA/RMA andGA/GMA which is expected to result in reduced Federal costs without increasingState or local costs.  The majority of refugees now arriving in the United States receive extendedperiods of U.S. cultural orientation and English language instruction overseasbefore reaching this country_training which was not available when the18-month limitation went into effect in 1982. We believe that the utilityof this training can now be reflected in a shorter period of eligibilityfor special assistance that is not available to U.S. citizens or immigrantsto the U.S.   <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments Received   </ITAG>We received 79 comments on the proposed regulation, from State and localgovernment agencies, national and local voluntary refugee resettlementagencies, service providers, refugee advisory boards, consortiums and forumsconcerned with refugee resettlement, refugee mutual assistance associations,refugees, and other individuals. Seventy-six comments opposed the proposal;two supported it; and one supported the reduction in RCA while recommendingthat the eligibility period for RMA be increased to 24 months.   The following paragraphs address specific points the commenters raised.  <T3>Comment: </T3>The majority of comments opposing the proposal statedthat a   12-month period for RCA and RMA is too short to allow sufficientEnglish language and skill training and adjustment to U.S. society forrefugees to become employed. A few commenters specifically mentioned theneeds of Hmong refugees in this connection. A few other commenters saidthat the change would result in family breakups, mental health problems,and refugees' being stuck in dead-end jobs as a result of having to goto work before they had sufficient training.  <T3>Response: </T3>We agree that no given period, whether it is 18 monthsor 12 months, can be optimum for all refugees. We also recognize that,in areas where GA programs are not available or where such programs arevery restrictive, an end-date for RCA/RMA eligibility can have a negativeeffect on some refugees and refugee families.   On the other hand, overall experience with the refugee program does notsupport a contention that more than 12 months are required before manyrefugees can be expected to become employed. In fact, some of the commentersnoted that refugees do become employed soon after arrival in the U.S. andurged that the 18-month period be retained to assist these refugees ifthey should be laid off during the initial 18-month period.   We would also note that employment does not preclude continuing Englishlanguage or other training during non-work hours. Many refugees whose initialemployment was an entry-level job that could have been considered ``dead-end''have subsequently advanced through additional training and experience.  Despite the generally greater needs of many Hmong refugees in making atransition from their own culture to that of the United States, experiencehas shown that when resettlements are carefully planned in communitieswith favorable opportunities for entering employment, Hmong refugees havebeen successful in obtaining and retaining jobs. Accordingly, we continueto believe that a 12-month period for RCA and RMA is reasonable and thatno change is warranted from the proposed regulation.   <T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters indicated that they believe GA rulesmight foster long-term dependency. Therefore they feel it would be undesirablefor some refugees to have to rely on existing State or local general assistance(GA) programs beginning with the 13th month after their arrival ratherthan the 19th.<T3>Response:</T3> Relatively few refugees rely on GA programs after theexpiration of their 18-month eligibility period for RCA. As of September30, 1987, fewer than 8,500 refugees nationally were receiving GA duringtheir months 19-31 in the U.S. Based on the experience to date, we do notbelieve that making GA available in a refugee's 13th month, rather than19th month, will have any appreciable effect on longer term GA dependency. <T3>Comment:</T3> Some commenters considered the proposal a means of shiftingcosts from the Federal Government to State and local governments. Threecommenters saw it as impacting county medical costs. One commenter understoodthe proposal as shortening the overall period of funding for GA.  <T3>Response:</T3> This regulation reduces the RCA/RMA eligiblity periodfrom 18 months to 12 months, but it does not shift costs since Federalrefugee funds now begin to cover the cost of GA/GMA with the 13th monthrather than the 19th.  The regulation does not shorten the overall period of funding for cashand medical assistance which was 31 months at the time that the proposalwas published and is now 24 months. This overall period depends on theamount of funds appropriated rather than on regulation.    <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter concurred with the proposal to reduce RCAto 12 months but recommended that RMA be lengthened to 24 months and beavailable to any refugee not covered by employer-financed private insurance. <T3>Response:</T3> Since this recommendation would widen the existing gapbetween the assistance available to refugees and that available to U.S.citizens, it would run counter to our intention of reducing the differences. <T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters disagreed with our view, as statedin the notice of proposed rulemaking, that this proposal would ``reducethe degree of special treatment afforded to refugees, which results inunequal treatment among low-income populations.'' These commenters believethat, because of the special problems of refugees, the availability ofRCA/RMA during the first 18 months does not constitute an inequity.  <T3>Response:</T3> In localities where the RCA/RMA program provides a broadereligibility than GA/GMA, there is unequal, and more favorable, treatmentof refugees as compared with non-refugees. Shortening the period duringwhich RCA and RMA are available lessens this unequal treatment.  <T3>Comment:</T3> A few commenters suggested that the proposed change wascontrary to the purpose and intent of the Refugee Act. One commenter statedthat the change should be sought through legislation. Another commentersaid that the proposal was contrary to Executive Order 12291, contendingthat it was not based on adequate information, had a higher potential costthan benefit, would not maximize the net benefits to society, and did notrepresent the alternative having the least net cost to society.  <T3>Response:</T3> We do not agree that this change in the duration ofRCA/RMA either is contrary to the Refugee Act or requires legislation.The Act authorizes the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement toprovide cash and medical assistance during a refugee's first 36 monthsin the United States but does not prescribe the duration of assistance,scope of coverage, benefit payment levels, or other details of a programof special assistance except for the requirement that employable recipientsmust accept employment services and employment. The Act authorizes theSecretary to issue such regulations as he deems appropriate to carry outthe statute. We consider our ability to regulate the duration of the specialprograms of RCA and RMA to have already been established by the 1982 regulationwhich established the 18-month limitation.  As noted below in the section on ``Regulatory Procedures,'' this regulationdoes not meet the definition of a ``major rule'' under Executive Order12291, since the regulation decreases costs. In addition, the regulationdoes not result in increased costs for States or localities. We also disagreewith the substance of the comments related to the Executive Order: We consideradequate information to exist on which to base the changes made in thisregulation, including State-by-State data on the utilization of RCA andRMA. We also believe that the beneficial effects of more rapid refugeeself-sufficiency, reduced welfare dependency, more equal treatment amonglow-income populations, and reduced Federal expenditures will outweighthe costs of the refugee population as has been the case with the previousreduction in RCA and RMA from 36 months to 18 months.  <T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters stated that refugees affected by theproposal would move to areas with greater welfare benefits. Therefore thecommenters expressed doubt that the regulation would achieve the projected$14 million in Federal savings.  <T3>Response:</T3> Currently, the availability of RCA and RMA ends aftera refugee's 18th month in the United States. This regulation simply movesthat point to the 12th month. Therefore, to the extent that secondary migrationresults from the termination of RCA/RMA, it will be likely to occur 6 monthssooner than in the past. We do not believe, however, that secondary migrationwill be substantially greater than before because the latest availablesurvey data (Fall 1985) that bear on this question do not show the utilizationof cash assistance to be higher at 12 months than at 18 months.  With reference to potential savings, since RCA/RMA costs in FY 1987 totaled$83.2 million, we believe that the $14 million in projected net savingsrepresents a conservative estimate which can be achieved.  Regulatory Procedures  <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291  </ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, we must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirements of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.This regulation does not meet the definition of a ``major'' regulationcontained in the Executive Order. This regulation does not increase costs;rather, it decreases costs by decreasing Federal funding.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.604(b)), the Secretary certifies that this rule does not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act  </ITAG>This rule does not contain collection-of-information requirements whichrequire approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980.    <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 400  </ITAG>Grant programs_Social programs, Health care, Public assistance programs,Refugees, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 29, 1988.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Wayne A.
