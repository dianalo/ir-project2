Each of the Tribes has expressed concerns about the suitabilityof the Hanford Site in eastern Washington. These concerns, in general,address the proposed repository's effects on traditional spiritual beliefsand cultural practices, on tribal sovereignty and the Tribes' right toself-government, on the natural resources under tribal management jurisdiction,and on the health and socioeconomic characteristics of the Tribes' reservationcommunities. The Yakima, Umatilla, and Nez Perce have distinctive culturaltraditions that may be adversely affected by activities related to theBasalt Waste Isolation Project (BWIP). Further, the Tribes enjoy a uniquerelationship with the federal government. Because of their distinctivecultures and governmental status, particular attention will be paid toexpressed interests of the Tribes, and to ways in which these interestsmay be affected by the repository program. Monitoring is needed to describecurrent conditions among the Affected Tribes' populations, to describeBWIP site characterization activities affecting the Tribes, and to measureany changes in these conditions that may occur as a direct result ofsite characterization. This paper reports our first efforts at gatheringhistorical information. It summarizes materials contained in two sources:the reports of field agents to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs (1854-1936),and the dockets of the Indian Claims Commission. 24 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
