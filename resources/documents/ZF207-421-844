 Though hardbound, this volume of romanticsuspense from pulp publisher Ballantine Books celebrates the genre--staleprose; convoluted subplots; beautiful, brilliant, tediously naive heroinescourted by mysterious men.andP;  And, of course, the predictable helping ofgratuitous sex.andM;The Eight, Neville's first novel, is a veritable Rubik's Cube of mysterieswithin a mystery that features the parallel lives of two women.andP;  Mireille deRemy, flame-haired novice from an abbey, somehow encounters virtually everynotable who happened to pass through history around the time of the FrenchRevolution (give or take 50 years).andP;  Her modern counter-character isCatherine &quot;Cat&quot; Velis, sexy computer expert, whose job takes her to Algeriain the days preceding the OPEC oil crisis of 1974.andM;The two spend their waking hours in these times of turmoil searching for thescattered pieces of a chess set once used by Charlemagne.andP;  The chess set isreputted to possess mysterious and destructive powers.andM;The secret of the set lies in a formula that is scratched into the variouspieces and cannot be deciphered until the pieces are assembled.andP;  Mireille, inthe B.C.andP;  (Before Computers) era, pursues the pieces in hide-and-go-seekfashion, much as if she were searching for a runaway child.andP;  Cat followsleads that unfold as mathematic puzzles focusing on the number eight (thenumber of rows and columns on a chessboard).andP;  Oddly, this reputed computerexpert rarely solves the puzzles on a computer; she works them out withpencil and paper.andP;  On the computer, she enters information on the economy andhistory of the Western world for OPEC countries interested in how the Westwill respond when they shut off the oil.andP;  The OPEC intrigue, like the FrenchRevolution, is only a backdrop for an occasionally amusing, romantic tale ofthe exploits of the two women.andM;As pulp parody, The Eight can be, as the review on its dust jacket says,&quot;great fun&quot; (well, some fun).andM;Robot AdeptandM;Robot Adept is not one of best-selling sci-fi writer Piers Anthony's betterefforts.andP;  It reads more like a computer text adventure game than popularfiction.andP;  Without a relational database to track the plot, be prepared tostumble blindly through the events of the book's parallel worlds and the fateof its parallel protagonists and their parallel lovers as they changeattributes (in parallel, of course) more often than chameleons at a lightshow.andM;Robot Adept is the fifth book of Anthony's Apprentice Adept series.andP;  Itsheroes are twins who have the unique ability to pass between the parallelworlds of Phaze (magic) and Proton (science), which appear in the earlier,better volumes in the series.andP;  Evil powers want to recruit the twins to starta revolution that would destroy life on both planets.andP;  Unfortunately for thereader, none of this becomes apparent until about page 100.andM;After swapping worlds one day, the twins fall in love.andP;  The science twin, asensitive robot, is smitten by a lovely unicorn mare who passes sometimes asa woman, sometimes as a hummingbird.andP;  The magic man, a budding sorcerer,falls for an amoeba that can transform itself into a nubile young maiden.andM;Here's where the characters begin exchanging bodies.andP;  In one passage, theunicorn resides in an amoeba's body on Proton and lands an office job workingfor one of the villains.andP;  Back on Phaze, the real amoeba woman does herunicorn imitation and learns to behave like a hummingbird.andP;  Elsewhere, therobot and the sorcerer switch bodies.andM;At the peak of this twisted tale, the twins compete in a series of computergames that will determine whether their worlds sink into revolution.andP;  Twocharacters--one representing good, the other evil--maneuver through a complexseries of plays, changing form and sides as they go along.andP;  In the end, itseems that decency wins, but the &quot;or so he hoped&quot; ending is a setup for yetanother sequel that we hope isn't as convoluted as this one.andM;MismatchandM;Lloyd Pye manages to combine the familiar requirements of the paperbackpotboiler with computer hacking, phone phreaking, kinky sex, suave Sovietspies, sadistic FBI agents, health food, and a fair-sized dollop of racismand sexism, all in one book.andM;According to the foreword, Mismatch is a justification of the breakup of ATandamp;T(referred to only as &quot;Ma Bell&quot;) on national security grounds, but the premiseis a bit confused.andM;The plot concerns the revenge of America's top hacker/phone phreaker, theKing, who is roughed up when arrested by the FBI.andP;  He plots to embarrass thegovernment by paralyzing the phone network.andP;  Unfortunately, the number twophreaker helping him is a Soviet agent in deep cover.andP;  The Soviet&quot;terminates&quot; the King, leaving America without its top spy and helpless todefend itself against attack.andP;  Pye never clarifies how the breakup of ATandamp;Twould affect this preposterous premise.andM;The real problem with Mismatch, however, isn't its silly plot but itsexecrable writing and vile attitudes.andP;  Pye betrays his prejudices withpassages like this one, on the first page: &quot;...Hoover responded by saying,&quot;Brandt's the only nigger I'd piss on if he was on fire.'andP;  From anunrepentant racist like Hoover, that was high praise indeed.&quot;andM;Later he goes after women as well, in a gratuitous scene between a pregnantnaval officer and one of her team:andM;&quot;Anyone watching might have considered it strange to see a twenty-year-oldblack noncom being so familiar with a twenty-eight-year-old white officer.andO;But the purpose behind her gesture transcended age, race, and rank.andM;&quot;It was necessary to convey heartfelt encouragement from one of Nature'svassals to another when compassion was sorely needed.&quot;andM;Pye seems to be describing his own book when he later writes, &quot;So far, it hadbeen a pain everywhere but her eyelashes.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
