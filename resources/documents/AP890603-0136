(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cracks found in the ceilings and floorsof two test rooms in an underground nuclear waste repository couldcause problems with worker safety and waste retrieval, a technicaloversight expert said Saturday.   The U.S. Department of Energy, however, had anticipated thecracks in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant test rooms insoutheastern New Mexico and is still aiming for a September openingdate, said Ben McCarty, an agency spokesman.   WIPP is a DOE project designed to store plutonium-contaminatedwaste related to defense 2,150 feet below the surface in ancientsalt beds 26 miles southeast of Carlsbad.   Lokesh Chaturvedi, deputy director of the EnvironmentalEvaluation Group, which is helping to monitor the project, said thecracks pose two potential problems _ worker safety and the easewith which waste can be retrieved from the site if there areproblems.   Four test rooms _ each 300 feet long, 33 feet wide and 13 feethigh _ were excavated in March and April 1983. Researchers areusing the rooms to study the the behavior of salt collapsing around55-gallon drums of nuclear waste, Chaturvedi said.   ``Soon after the rooms were excavated, it was found that therate of (collapse) was three to four times higher than predicted,''he said.   That was a good sign, because the faster the rooms close, thefaster the waste will become entombed, Chaturvedi said. The drumsare expected to corrode away in 20 years, he said.   But in 1985, a 4-inch-wide crack appeared wall-to-wall in thefloor of one of the rooms when 3-foot-diameter holes were beingdrilled, Chaturvedi said.   ``That was of concern because it showed salt moved in fast butit was cracking because of impurities in the salt,'' he said.   Then, in 1987, the DOE found two continuous fractures above theroofs of two other test rooms _ one about 3{ feet above the ceilingand another about 7{ feet above, Chaturvedi said.   ``It posed dangers to workers who had equipment in the room, sothe DOE decided to clear out the rooms ... or have limited-accessrooms,'' said Chaturvedi, who learned about the cracks May 2.   McCarty said the rooms are supposed to come down. ``It's just anexperiment,'' he said.   Wendell Weart, chief WIPP scientist for Sandia NationalLaboratories, said the anticipated, desirable effects of so-calledsalt creep ``have been considered and retrieval is still assured.''   McCarty said analysis of the cracking was not included in asupplemental Environmental Impact Statement because there areestablished mining procedures to prevent problems from the cracks.   The procedures includied reinforcing the two rooms with the mostrecent cracks with rock bolts. No waste will be placed in theunbolted rooms, McCarty said.   Weart said the rock bolts will assure that no loose slabs ofsalt could fall and breach a waste drum, assuring ``adequatestability through the retrieval period.''   Chaturvedi, however, contended that if DOE officials ``putthousands of drums ... in the rooms to be taken out, there might bea problem in retrieving the waste because one cannot be absolutelybe certain that rock-bolting will keep the ceiling as well as thefloor from buckling.''   The DOE has a five-year experimental and operational phase inwhich to put waste in the rooms and take it out.   ``The whole thing lies on the DOE plan _ do they want to placewaste temporarily instead of permanently? If they were simply tomake the decision permanently, then we would not have to worryabout these questions,'' he said.   Chaturvedi said his group ``would simply like the DOE not to puta large quantity of waste underground without first making certainthat they need to leave it there.''   His group, funded by the DOE, is charged with technicalevaluation of WIPP for the health and safety of the public and theenvironment.</TEXT></DOC>
