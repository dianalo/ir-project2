<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-57-1014 </DOCNO><TEXT>The catalytic oxidation of CO has been studied over Rh/SiO{sub 2} by usinga rapid transient response FTIR-mass spectrometric technique. The reactivityof linearly adsorbed CO was found to be considerably greater than thatof the dicarbonyl species at both 85 and 200{sup 0}C. The frequency oflinearly adsorbed CO was observed to undergo a continuous red shift duringthe duration of the transient, suggesting the formation of a mixed CO-oxygenadlayer. Induction times required for the formation of gas-phase CO{sub2} were found to be nearly 2 orders of magnitude lower than those observedfor Pt/SiO{sub 2} and Pd/SiO{sub 2}. Self-sustained CO-O{sub 2} oscillationsreinforce the greater reactivity of linearly adsorbed CO. H{sub 2}-CO-O{sub2} transient studies also suggest the formation of mixed hydrogen-COadlayers. Hydrogen was observed to react with the dicarbonyl speciesto form a hydridocarbonyl species. The CO which is displaced by hydrogenreacts rapidly with chemisorbed oxygen to form CO{sub 2}.</TEXT></DOC>
