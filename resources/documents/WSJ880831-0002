But some bank creditors maintain that many Latins -- and not just the wealthy -- are living pretty well.    How well? Trying to determine whether it is &quot;really true that the people in these countries are suffering from a more costly life than people in the U.S. and Japan,&quot; Bank of Tokyo surveyed living standards in major Latin American debtor nations -- including Argentina, Brazil and Mexico -- and those in the U.S. and Japan.    The survey compared prices for 11 categories of food, clothing, housing and transportation, and expressed them as a ratio of the average monthly salary for a professional person. The study concludes that living standards aren't much worse in Latin America than they are in the U.S. and Japan.    Even though a Japanese manager takes home $5,000 a month, he generally has to pay out a higher proportion of his income for transportation, land and housing, and for some staple foods such as meat and rice, the survey says. The astronomical price of land in Japan also means that it is difficult to own even a small house there, according to the study.    The survey asserts that an American making $4,170 a month is relatively better off than his Japanese counterpart. Even so, the American pays proportionately more for steak than his Mexican and Chilean counterparts; more for taxis than Argentines and Mexicans; and more for rent than Brazilians and Mexicans.    The survey's author, Sachio Kohjima, Bank of Tokyo's deputy general manager and head of its Latin American banking group, says that &quot;while it is true that Latin Americans are experiencing high levels of inflation, people in these countries seem to be enjoying their daily life without preparations for a rainy day.&quot; He compares their lifestyle to that of the grasshopper in Aesop's fables, which leaped about without a care for the future. In contrast, &quot;the Japanese are more like {Aesop's} hard-working ants,&quot; he says.    Mr. Kohjima's findings, which are to be published in the Japanese press, provoke some sharp reactions from U.S. economists who specialize in Latin American affairs.    &quot;This is disgusting. It shows how our friends in the creditor world have no idea what is going on in Latin America,&quot; says Jeffrey D. Sachs, a Harvard University economics professor who writes frequently on the international debt problem.    Mr. Sachs, who advises Bolivia and consults with other Latin American governments, says there are &quot;massive income inequalities in Latin America.&quot; Although a tiny number of people -- including those who negotiate their country's debt -- may be living well, the vast majority of people in the continent are suffering, he asserts.    &quot;This kind of thing is ludicrous. How many managers are there in Latin America -- one in 10,000 of the population,&quot; or if lower-paid managers are included, one in a thousand, Mr. Sachs says. &quot;There is massive poverty in Latin America and there has been a sharp rise in malnutrition in the region&quot; since the debt crisis began in 1982, he says.    Mr. Kohjima isn't a fan of Mr. Sachs. His survey dismisses the arguments of Mr. Sachs and others who maintain that some debt relief organized by the U.S. and other industrialized countries is needed to solve the international debt problem. Such solutions wouldn't work in the long run, Mr. Kohjima says.    Like most big international creditors, Bank of Tokyo is particularly concerned about Argentina, which has recently fallen behind on interest payments on its $55 billion foreign debt.    Mr. Kohjima is gloomy about the outlook for that country. &quot;There is no prospect that the {Argentine} export capacity will increase dramatically in the foreseeable future,&quot; which would allow the country to prosper and service its debt, the survey says. &quot;Argentines had been enjoying a higher standard of living than Europeans until very recently.&quot;    Mr. Kohjima's remedy: &quot;I sincerely hope that the Argentines will accept an austere life like Aesop's ants for the betterment of their future.&quot;     ---                     A Price Comparison    Incomes and selected expenses in five countries.
