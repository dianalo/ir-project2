(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Law schools are receiving a flood ofapplications this year, and the reasons include Oliver North, BabyM, Robert Bork, Black Monday and ``L.A. Law,'' admissions officerssay.   However, for some would-be lawyers, it's none of the above.   ``Law school has always been in the back of my mind,'' saidHarvard senior Janet Korins, who has been accepted by Harvard LawSchool. ``I'm sorry to disappoint everyone, but I wanted to gobefore I watched `L.A. Law.'''   Ms. Korins is among this year's 66,790 or so law schoolapplicants that the Law School Admissions Council of Newtown, Pa.,says represents a 16 percent increase over last year. The jump hasmystified admissions officers. At some schools, applications havehit record numbers.   The high number of applicants has made it even tougher to getinto law schools. The schools are seeing better qualifiedcandidates, including physicians, successful business people andapplicants with master's degrees.   ``People who would've been accepted last year might not beaccepted this year,'' said Andrew Cornblatt, director of admissionsfor Georgetown University's law school.   Georgetown leads the nation with 8,500 applications, a 32percent increase over last year and a school record. Cornblatt hasbeen left wondering why. Among his best guesses are:   _The Iran-Contra hearing, the Robert Bork confirmation hearing,and the highly publicized Baby M custody battle, all of whichshowed the law in action;   _The Oct. 19 stock market crash and the insider tradingscandals, which may have turned some people away from businessschool;   _And the hit NBC television series ``L.A. Law,'' whichglamorizes the legal profession.   However, other admissions officers say these explanations arespeculation, and don't seem to prove true when tested against fact.   For instance, most law school applicants signed up for the LawSchool Aptitude Test, the standardized test used in admissions,before the Iran-Contra and Bork hearings and the stock market crashand while ``L.A. Law'' was in reruns.   ``I have the same educated guesses as everybody else. But mybest guess is maybe it's just law's turn again,'' said Edward G.Tom, director of admissions and financial aid at Berkeley's lawschool, Boalt Hall.   Boalt Hall this year saw the largest one-year jump inapplications since 1970. The number of applications rose about 30percent, from 4,093 to 5,282, said Tom.   The University of Michigan Law School stopped takingapplications at number 5,500, which is up from last year's total of4,300. The school has 370 openings, said Allan Stillwagon,admissions officer.   ``About every forth or fifth application reports either aninterest in law or renewed interest that mysteriously arose afterwatching the hours of Iran and Bork hearings,'' said Stillwagon.   Seton Hall's law school here saw a 27 percent increase, from1,500 to 1,832, said Dean of Admissions Edward Hendrickson, whoguessed that troubles on Wall Street might be a factor.   ``The MBA might not be that attractive anymore,'' he said.   Elizabeth Knier, a University of California, Los Angeles senioraccepted by Georgetown, said she has considered law for some time,but made her mind up after testing the business job market.   ``I was disappointed in the jobs that were offered and the jobsthat weren't offered,'' she said. ``However, it wasn't my primemotivation. I've always thought about law school.''   Courtney Koger, who was accepted by Harvard Law, said sheconsidered business school briefly, but stuck to her original planto study law.   ``I'd like to go into family law,'' she said. ``But I reallyknew that before the Baby M case even hit the newspapers. It didn'taffect my decision.'' Noreen Clohessy, a senior at Siena College inLoudonville, N.Y., who applied to Seton Hall, said she had takenprelaw classes as an undergraduate and always had the idea shewould pursue law school after graduation.   ``It's not because of `L.A. Law,''' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
