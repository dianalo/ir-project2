The compromise bill, which melded Senate and Houseversions, broadens and toughens the rules for authorizingcovert actions first adopted a decade ago. But the bill isless restrictive than a version President Bush vetoed lastfall. The compromise bill now goes to the full Senate andHouse. The White House hasn't said whether the new languageis acceptable, but officials said privately that it appearsto satisfy executive branch concerns that U.S. activityabroad not be hampered.</LP><TEXT>   Under existing law, covert programs abroad carried out bythe Central Intelligence Agency must be authorized by thepresident in a secret pronouncement called a &quot;finding&quot; andmust be reported to the Intelligence committees in advance orat least in a &quot;timely&quot; fashion.   During the Iran-Contra affair in the Reaganadministration, aides tried to circumvent those rules byfunding secret arms sales and cash transfers outside the CIAbudget. They also made extensive use of third-party countriesand private citizens, and they cited what they claimed wereoral findings and even retroactive findings to justify theiractions, which weren't reported to Congress.   The new rules would require written findings in advanceand quick congressional reporting of any finding thatanticipates covert action by any U.S. agency, not just theCIA. They would require that the findings specify all theagencies involved and whether third parties will be involved.And they would state that findings may not call for illegalacts or efforts to influence domestic U.S. politics or publicopinion.   In nearly all cases, Congress would have to be notified inadvance of covert actions. Both the new bill and existing lawrecognize that in some cases, that isn't possible. However,Congress dropped efforts to specify how quickly the WhiteHouse must report such covert actions, which was a majorissue.   The executive branch insists that under the Constitutionit can delay as long as it likes, but President Bush haspledged to report within a few days on actions that weren'tdisclosed in advance. The two committees said they disagreewith the administration's constitutional argument but acceptMr. Bush's personal pledge.</TEXT></DOC>
