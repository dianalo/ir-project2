Democratic leaders, who oppose the capital gains legislation,were looking for a way to pass the deficit-reduction bill withoutthe tax cut.   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, announcedthat seven hours of meetings had produced no agreement.Nevertheless, he said, he and Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas``believe that the prospects for such an agreement are sufficientlyencouraging to commit that we will continue our meetings.''   The next round of negotiations was scheduled Sunday morning.   The central question is whether Republicans will be able to adda capital gains cut to the bill by a simple majority vote _ 51 atmost _ or whether they will have to get 60 votes because of rulesthat govern consideration of the deficit bill.   The House bill already includes a capital gains cut.   Each side set the groundwork for blaming the other if thenegotiations fail. Failure could mean further delay in passage of acatchall package of deficit reduction _ known as reconciliation _and lead to automatic, across-the-board cuts in federal spending onOct. 16.   Mitchell told reporters the White House is closely involved inthe discussions. ``Our primary objective is ... a meaningfuldeficit-reduction package,'' he said. ``The difference we have inthis discussion is that the primary objective of the administrationis a capital-gains tax cut.''   Dole said of the Democrats: ``They've got a problem. They aregoing to be blamed for ... (the automatic budget cuts) and they'vegot to get out of it.''   Mitchell met with Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of theFinance Committee, and Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of theBudget Committee. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., attendedbriefly.   Trying to develop GOP strategy with Dole were Sens. PeteDomenici of New Mexico and Bob Packwood of Oregon, seniorRepublicans on, respectively, the Budget and Finance committees.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and White House budgetdirector Richard G. Darman led the administration effort.   The stated purpose of the meetings is to find a way to stripfrom the deficit-reduction bill _ a package of revenue increasesand spending cuts _ that are not directly related to reducing thedeficit. The measure has become so weighted down with extraneouspet projects that there is little likelihood that Congress canenact it before the Oct. 16 deadline.   The chief controversy is over Bush's proposal to cut taxes oncapital gains. The measure is part of the House version of the billand Republicans want to add it to the Senate version.   Democratic leaders in the Senate are countering with anamendment to eliminate the capital gains cut and substitute anexpansion of tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts.   Republicans insist that if every extraneous item is strippedfrom the bill _ and they don't concede that capital gains isextraneous _ they be assured a separate vote on capital gains. Thatwould leave them an easier path to passage with just a simplemajority.   But Mitchell was emphatic that Democrats, who control theSenate, will not waive any Senate rules to make it easier forRepublicans to duplicate the capital gains victory they took in theHouse. ``That will not happen,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
