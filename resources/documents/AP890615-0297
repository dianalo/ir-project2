During his 19-year career at Drexel, Milken widely was creditedwith creating a $175 billion-a-year market in the low-costsecurities called junk bonds that turned Drexel from a Wall Streetalso-ran into an investment powerhouse.   But the federal government alleges Milken used his powers throughDrexel to engage in a range of securities crimes, including schemeswith now-jailed stock speculator Ivan Boesky.   It was unclear what the impact of Milken's departure would haveon the government's case or on Drexel, where Milken still commandstremendous loyalty among some key junk bond employees and manyDrexel clients.   Milken's new consulting firm, International Capital Access Group,will advise and assist companies seeking to raise money to start up,expand or stay in business. It will not buy or sell securities,people familiar with Milken's plans said.   Milken had been on leave from Drexel since his March 29 criminalindictment on 98 counts of fraud and racketeering. His brother,Lowell, who also was charged in the case, announced Thursday he wasquitting the firm to return to practicing law.   ``Drexel is the only company I've ever worked for sincegraduating from college. And it's the only one I ever expected towork for,'' Michael Milken said in a statement.   ``I am naturally disappointed to be forced to leave Drexel aspart of the firm's settlement with the government, but I lookforward to the opportunity of helping people build companies,'' hesaid.   Under a civil settlement with the Securities and ExchangeCommission of insider trading and other charges, Drexel in Mayagreed to sever ties with Milken and to bar its employees fromdirect or indirect business dealings with him.   ``Michael Milken made many important contributions to DrexelBurnham, and his resignation, although not unexpected, is a sadevent,'' Drexel stated. ``We wish him well in his new endeavor.''   Milken has been accused of insider trading in a separate SEClawsuit. No settlement has been reached and no trial scheduled inthat case.   Milken, 42, joined Drexel full-time in 1970 after graduating fromthe Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1978, hemoved Drexel's entire junk bond division to Beverly Hills, Calif.,and revolutionized the sale of the securities in the 1980s.   Milken's aggressive sale of junk bonds _ previously used mainlyby companies with low credit ratings _ helped fuel the decade'scorporate takeover mania by giving small- and medium-sized companiesand some corporate raiders a more accessible tool for financinggrowth, mergers and takeovers.   He also earned enormous sums. According to court papers, Milkenmade more than $1 billion from 1983 to 1987, including $550 millionin 1987.   The criminal securities and racketeering indictment againstMilken marked the pinnacle so far of the government's three-yearcrackdown on Wall Street crime. A broader indictment of Milken alsois expected.   Milken's trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan is set forMarch 1990. Under the racketeering provisions, Milken faces up to$1.85 billion in forfeited illegal profits. He would also be subjectto huge fines and a lengthy prison term if convicted. Milken is freeunder a $700 million bond package.   Lawyers close to the case indicated Milken's decision to resignmay have been calculated. By quitting, Milken pre-empts the firm'sagreement with the SEC to dismiss him once its settlement isapproved by a federal judge.   Approval has been delayed pending Milken's challenge to certainprovisions governing his employment status. But the Supreme Courtthis month refused to hear Milken's case and the SEC and Drexel soonare expected to ask U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack to ratify theagreement.   But with Milken's resignation, lawyers may argue that parts ofthe Drexel pact are moot and mount further challenges to the case.They also are expected to challenge the provision barring Drexel andMilken from doing business with the same clients.   People familiar with Milken's plans said his new firm has ahandful of employees and a temporary office in Los Angeles. No oneworking for Drexel has been hired and the firm does not intend totake people from Drexel, they said, but there could be defections.   Milken's statement said his firm would provide ``advice and otherassistance to individuals, communities and companies'' and``emphasize the creation of ownership opportunities for employees,minorities and unions.''</TEXT></DOC>
