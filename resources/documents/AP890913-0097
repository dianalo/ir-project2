Also today, a guerrilla commander announced his fighters havestarted a northern offensive to cut Soviet supply routes to Kabul.   In the south, guerrillas reportedly pushed back a 1,000-vehiclearmy convoy with winter provisions for Afghanistan's second largestcity, Kandahar.   Workers at Kabul airport said the facility was shut down afterthe attack, but air traffic resumed in the afternoon.   Officials would not confirm the attack.   The casualties occurred at a military base near the airport, usedby civilian and military aircraft, airport workers said.   They said a Soviet-made Antonov supply plane was set ablaze by arocket as it taxied to the runway. The crew jumped off after thefirst rockets fell, witnesses said. Workers and witnesses alldemanded anonymity.   One missile fell 40 yards from the airport's executive lounge,blasting out its glass window and forcing officials inside to takeshelter.   It also just missed a U.N. jet, scattering shrapnel thatpunctured holes in the aircraft, the witnesses said. U.N. officialspatched the plane with special metal tape.   More than 300 people have been killed and more than 700 injuredin almost daily rocket attacks since June by fundamentalist Moslemguerrillas.   Reporters waiting downtown for a special flight to Kandahar weretold they could not leave because of ``technical difficulties.''   In neighboring Pakistan, Western diplomatic sources said amassive Afghan army convoy of trucks, tanks and armored personnelcarriers from the Soviet Union was turned back from Kandahar byfierce guerrilla attacks.   Its original size reportedly was between 1,000 and 1,300 trucks,tanks and armored personnel carriers, but diplomatic sources,speaking on condition of anonymity, said the insurgents may havedestroyed more than 110 vehicles.   Kabul government officials said the convoy is carrying winterprovisions for 200,000 people in besieged Kandahar. It has taken thecolumn more than two weeks to travel 400 miles south from Torghundiat the Soviet border.   Guerrillas destroyed about 80 vehicles at the halfway point nearShindand, diplomatic sources said. The convoy eventually pushed towithin 36 miles of Kandahar, when guerrillas again destroyed 30vehicles, they said.   At latest report, the column had retreated 33 miles and splitinto two, with helicopters lifting some of the cargo to Kandahar.   ``It would take an exceedingly long time for the regime totransport any significant portion of the convoy's cargo to Kandaharin this way,'' said one diplomatic source.   Meanwhile, guerrilla commander Ahmad Shah Masoud sent a radiomessage to Pakistan, where the insurgents are based, saying hisforces are attacking four areas along the key Salang Highway northof Kabul, including the communist government's biggest air forcebase at Bagram.   ``His message gave us no details about casualties but he said themujahedeen (guerrillas) gained some very big successes, especiallyat Salang,'' said Masoud Khalili, a spokesman of the Jamiat-i-Islamirebel group.   Masoud is considered the most effective of guerrilla commanderswho have fought 10 years to topple the Soviet-backed government.   The diplomatic sources said intense fighting continues around theeastern garrison town of Khost, with high casualties on both sides.They said guerrillas shot down one transport plane and destroyedfour more on the ground at Khost's military airport between Thursdayand Saturday.   The guerrillas have failed to capture a major Afghan city sincethe last Soviet forces withdrew from the civil war on Feb. 15.</TEXT></DOC>
