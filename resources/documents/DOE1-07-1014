<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-07-1014 </DOCNO><TEXT>Experimental data are reported for the ion exchange equilibria of thebinary systems UO/sub 2//sup 2+/-H/sup +/, UO/sub 2//sup 2+/-Na/sup +/,and Na/sup +/-H/sup +/ on a strong acid cation exchange resin at 25 degC. These systems exhibit nonideal characteristics in both phases. Thedependence of In/sub j//sup i/K/sub c/ (corrected selectivity coefficient)on X/sub i/-bar (equivalent fraction in resin phase) is fitted to a polynomialequation from which the rational equilibrium constants and the activitycoefficients in resin phase are obtained.</TEXT></DOC>
