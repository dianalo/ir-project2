These analysts are predicting rising mortgage rates and anotherboost in banks' prime lending rate, the benchmark rate for manyconsumer and business loans.   This forecast, if it proves accurate, would likely put thecentral bank on a collision course with the Bush administration,which is counting on strong economic growth and falling interestrates to help it trim the federal deficit without resorting to newtaxes.   Many economists believe the Fed has already started tighteningcredit conditions and they expect further efforts along that linewhen Fed policy-makers meet behind closed doors today and Wednesdayto review the performance of the economy and make revisions tomonetary strategy.   The Federal Open Market Committee, headed by Federal ReserveChairman Alan Greenspan, meets eight times a year to set guidelinesfor monetary policy consistent with the bank's job of promotingnon-inflationary growth.   While the economy is now in its seventh year of expansion withouta downturn, Fed officials have expressed concerns that tight labormarkets and high factory operating rates could spur a newinflationary spiral.   Recent signs of economic strength, including a strongunemployment report for November, have many analysts convinced thatFed policymakers believe the economy may be overheating.   ``From an economic standpoint the Fed clearly should tighten,''said Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm bearing hisname. ``The economy is strong and all sorts of inflationary signsare cropping up.''   Many analysts say they have detected signs that the Fed istightening credit behind the scenes. They note that the federalfunds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnightloans, has been rising. It averaged 8.59 percent last week, thehighest weekly average in two years and up from 8.44 percent theweek before.   This rate often serves as an early-warning signal that the Fed ismaking moves to restrict the amount of reserves banks have on handto make loans.   ``I think the Fed believes we are at full employment and we can'ttolerate strong growth any longer and it is time to hit thebrakes,'' said David Wyss, chief financial economist of DataResources Inc. of Lexington, Mass.   But the Fed's efforts will make Bush's goal of reducing thebudget deficit that much harder because it means economic growthwill be slower and the government's tax take lower and interestrates on the $2.6 trillion national debt will be higher.   The Fed is projecting economic growth, as measured by the GrossNational Product, of around 2 percent to 2.5 percent, far below theReagan administration's forecast of 3.5 percent GNP growth next year.   But economists detect no signals that the Fed will back off itsview that the economy can't afford to grow at those rates withoutrekindling inflation.   ``If the Fed has its way, the Bush administration will not haveits way and that means government revenues will be lower and thebudget deficit higher,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of theBoston Co.   Many economists said they were looking for the prime rate to moveup to 11 percent by late January, with similar increases in otherinterest rates. Major banks boosted the prime rate by one-halfpercentage point just two weeks ago, to 10.5 percent, the highestsince mid-1985.   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co., agovernment securities dealer, said he expects mortgage rates, nowaveraging around 10.46 percent for fixed-rate mortgages, will startclimbing as well.   ``By early next year, I would look for mortgage rates to bearound 11 percent to 11.25 percent and rising,'' he said. ``Mortgageborrowers should borrow now instead of waiting.''   Many economists said they were looking for an increase in theFed's discount rate, the interest the central bank charges on loansto member commercial banks, by the end of January.   The last increase in the discount rate, the most dramatic signalthe Fed can send of its intention to push interest rates higher,occurred on Aug. 9, when the rate was increased to 6.5 percent,capping a series of credit-tightening moves the central bank hadbegun in late March.   The Federal Open Market Committee is composed of members of theFederal Reserve Board and presidents of its regional banks. It meetsin private every six to eight weeks; decisions are not discloseduntil after the next meeting is held.</TEXT></DOC>
