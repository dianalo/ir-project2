Singing lawyers rhapsodized and harmonized before a singingjudge in a Chicago courtroom in presentations of Gilbert andSullivan's operetta ``Trial by Jury'' on Wednesday and Thursday.   ``Litigation is just like acting,'' said Scott Cooper, a triallawyer who played the judge in the Chicago Bar AssociationOrchestra production.   ``A lot of times we get a song and dance in the courtroom,'' headded.   Jim Guthrie, the stage director, said lawyers can be trying asperformers.   ``They're used to being in charge,'' he said. ``They listen,they take notes very well, and if you make a mistake, they're thereto tell you.''   The operetta, about a woman who accuses a man of breaking hispromise to marry her, drew a packed courtroom.   Unlike a regular court session, the spectators were allowedoutbursts of applause. And unlike a regular operetta, the castcould not tear down the set after the last performance _ underpenalty of law.</TEXT><DATELINE>GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Psychic consultant Karen Herbst hastraded in her crystal ball and tarot cards for a computer and a faxmachine to predict her clients' futures.   Herbst has created a computer program that she said is superiorto the old ways because it removes the psychic's personal views andprejudices from the process. The only information required for a$12 to $50 reading is the subject's time, date and place of birth.   ``When you go to a psychic or an astrologer, their view of thesituation is filtered by who they are. Starfax is not as biased,''Herbst said.   Herbst runs the month-old Starfax service from the basement ofher home. She says she computes 15 to 20 readings a day and usesher facsimile machine to receive requests and transmit forecasts byphone line to anyone with a similar machine.   ``I just wanted some information regarding my girlfriend,'' arecent fax request by a financial analyst read. ``Her birthday isDecember 31, 1960. Can you tell me if she's in the mood for love?''   ``Sherri is not in the mood for love,'' Herbst advised afterchecking with her computer. ``Buy her flowers and be patient untilthe first week of May.''</TEXT></DOC>
