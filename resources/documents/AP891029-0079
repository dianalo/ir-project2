It was the first time in the campaign for general elections setfor Feb. 25 that such violence occurred.   ``It's the same as in 1984,'' said opposition leader AzucenaFerrey, referring to the other elections held while the leftistSandinistas have been in power.   About 1,500 people gathered at a grass-covered field on highground above this northern Nicaraguan town near the border withHonduras to hear a speech by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,presidential candidate for the National Opposition Union.   UNO, as the 14-party coalition is known in Spanish, is the mainchallenger to Sandinista President Daniel Ortega.   As the crowd completed its march onto the field and Mrs.Chamorro was starting to speak, a group of four women and one manon the fringe of the gathering began waving a red-and-blackkerchief symbolic of the Sandinista Front.   The five began shouting in the faces of UNO supporters. Oneopposition sympathizer pulled out a machete but was persuaded byothers to put it back in its sheath.   The Sandinista supporters drew a group of about 20 UNO backersaway from the crowd and into a side street, where more Sandinistabackers apparently were waiting. After more shouting, someSandinistas started throwing rocks and the UNO supporters ran intothe crowd on the field.   Both sides then threw rocks at each other for about 10 minutes.   At least two election observers, one of them from theOrganization of American States, ran for cover when the rockthrowing started. The observers could be identified by tags theywore.   Agence France Press photographer Peter Northall was cut whenstruck on the neck by a rock; several other people were hit byrocks and limped away.   Police arrived 15 minutes after the melee started. About sixofficers stood on the side of the field and watched.   The UNO speakers started to descend from the wooden platform andon the other side of the field more rock throwing broke out.   A woman carrying a 2-month-old boy was knocked to the ground inthe fighting. The baby was bruised and the woman, who said she washis aunt, was scratched and scraped. Her arms and legs werebleeding.   UNO vehicles that had come from Managua, 220 miles south ofJalapa, were pelted with rocks and eggs as they left the town.</TEXT></DOC>
