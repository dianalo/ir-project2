<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-53-0558 </DOCNO><TEXT>This study investigates geochemical signatures associated with uraniumdeposition and host-rock alteration in unconformity-type U deposits ofthe Athabasca Basin using lithogeochemical data from drill core fromseveral properties within the Athabasca Basin: Midwest Lake, Dawn Lake,Key Lake, Collins Bay and Maurice Bay. Background data for the AthabascaGroup were obtained from regional drill holes located remote from anyknown U occurrence. Samples used in this study include mainly alteredand unaltered sediments of the Athabasca Group as well as some hydrothermallyaltered basement rocks. The samples were analyzed for a broad suite ofmajor oxides and trace elements. Mineralization processes involved thefollowing suite of ore elements: U, Ni, Co, As, Pb, Cu, Zn, Mo, and V,with the first five elements being the most abundant. Although the precipitationof U as pitchblende and Ni-Co as arsenides or sulfarsenides do not coincide,they are generally associated. 25 refs.;4 figs.;6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
