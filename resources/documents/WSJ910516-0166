Although it is still too early to gauge the effectivenessof the treatment, 16 of 20 patients treated up to nine monthsago have been in remission of their blood cancer, researchersfrom Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center here reported.</LP><TEXT>   Because of the way the acne drug is thought to work, theresults support a new concept of cancer chemotherapy. In thetype of leukemia suffered by the patients, white blood cellshave turned malignant at an immature stage of celldevelopment. Their arrested development is what renders thempractically immortal and dangerous.   The acne drug is believed to trigger these immature butmalignant cells to divide and mature and then die essentiallya natural death. This new concept of triggering cancer cellsto mature and die contrasts with the conventional concept ofchemotherapy, in which drugs simply poison malignant cells.   The drug used in the experimental treatment is known astretinoin, which belongs to a class of chemicals calledretinoic acids that are related to vitamin A. Tretinoin issold in ointment form as Retin-A, the acne medicationproduced by Johnson andamp; Johnson's Ortho Pharmaceuticaldivision. The tretinoin used in the leukemia patients,however, is a pill that was prepared for the experiment bychemists at Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., the U.S. arm of RocheHolding Ltd. of Switzerland. Roche, which has a long historyof making retinoic acids, sells one of its acids as Accutane,a pill for treating severe acne.   The particular form of leukemia that appears to respondreadily to the acne-drug type of treatment is called acutepromyelocytic leukemia. It is an uncommon cancer, afflictingabout 1,000 Americans a year, in which certain cells in thebone marrow become malignant before they have matured intofully functioning white blood cells. The malignant, immaturewhite cells (known as myelocytes) flood the blood stream,producing fatigue, fever, weight loss and bleeding.   Until now, chemotherapy with standard anti-cancer drugshas been the only effective treatment for acutepromyelocyltic leukemia, but it produces cures in only abouta third of patients.   The tip-off that an tretinoin-like drug might be effectivein treating the leukemia came from a genetic finding, Dr.Raymond P. Warrell Jr. of Memorial Sloan-Kettering and hiscolleagues in New York and at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center inHouston reported in this week's New England Journal ofMedicine.   Most patients with promyleocytic leukemia apparently havethe same defect in two of their 23 chromosomes, thestructures in the cell that contain all the genes. A piece ofchromosome number 17 appears to have broken loose and becomea part of chromosome number 15.   Last year, molecular geneticists identified one of thegenes in chromosome 17 that was damaged when the chunk of thechromosome broke loose. The damaged gene, it turned out,ordinarily made a protein -- a receptor -- that grabbed holdof retinoic acid. This and other laboratory findingssuggested that the immaturity of the leukemic white bloodcells might somehow be related to a foul-up in the way thecells handled or failed to handle retinoic acid.   The nature of the genetic damage also hinted that doses ofretinoic acids might prod the immature malignant cells toproceed to maturity and then die as normal white blood cellsdo.   &quot;We're now the third group to show remissions {withtretinoin} in this leukemia,&quot; following Chinese and Frenchresearchers, Dr. Warrell said. But, he added, the U.S. groupis the first to show that the drug works by triggering theimmature cancer cells to mature, or to &quot;differentiate,&quot; inthe biologists jargon. &quot;We've documented conclusively thatdifferentiation as a method of cancer therapy in humans is areality,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
