The 12-member Energy Research Advisory Board said in an interimreport to Watkins that the need for huge amounts of electricity torun an accelerator could offset the machine's environmental, safetyand possible cost advantages over nuclear reactors.   The panel is still studying the matter and is due to issue afinal report next February.   If substantiated, the panel's interim finding could add weightto the Bush administration's argument _ challenged by some membersof Congress _ that new nuclear reactors, not an accelerator, arethe best answer to the nation's tritium needs. The administrationhas proposed spending $6.8 billion to build two new reactors.   A linear accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in whichsubatomic particles are whipped at high speeds until they crashinto a target, in this case lithium clad in aluminium. Theresulting collision produces tritium, a radioactive gas used innuclear weapons to boost the warhead's explosive power.   Government-owned nuclear reactors at the Savannah River Site inSouth Carolina are the only source of tritium for U.S. nuclearwarheads. Those reactors, built in the early 1950s, have been idledfor repairs and safety improvements, and they are not expected tolast much beyond 2000.   The administration says new production capacity is needed toassure the readiness of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, although somenuclear scientists dispute that.   In the face of the administration's opposition to theaccelerator option, scientists at the Brookhaven and Los Alamosnational laboratories and at Westinghouse-Hanford Co. in Washingtonstate said earlier this year that an accelerator could produceneeded amounts of tritium more cheaply, quickly and safely than newreactors.   Watkins then asked the advisory board for an independentassessment of an accelerator's potential.   In its report, the board said one of its chief concerns is thata linear accelerator would require between 800 megawatts and 900megawatts of continuous power _ roughly equal to the entireelectric output of a large commercial power station.   The board called that ``an amount that is not only costly butmay not be readily available in the time frame of the years 2000 to2040'' when the accelerator would be working.   It said a new power station, possibly a nuclear reactor, mighthave to be built just to provide electricity for the accelerator.In that case, the evironmental and safety advantages of anaccelerator would be ``totally submerged,'' the panel said.   ``It may be simpler, in fact, to use a nuclear reactor toproduce tritium directly ... rather than have it, or a fossilplant, produce electricity to operate the accelerator,'' the reportsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
