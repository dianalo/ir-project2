These chemicals -- chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs -- arefrequently released when auto and commercial air conditioningand refrigeration units are serviced. The EPA proposals,which include mandatory and voluntary recycling programs, aredesigned to ensure that the chemicals are reused, rather thanreleased into the atmosphere.</LP><TEXT>   The ozone layer helps shield the Earth from harmfulultraviolet radiation, which causes skin cancer.   President Bush has committed the U.S. to phase out theproduction and importation of CFCs by the year 2000, under aninternational treaty process. An EPA official explained thatrecycling could cut $2 billion from industry's estimated $4.7billion cost of phasing out CFCs and halons, anotherozone-depleting chemical, by 2000.   A notice inviting public comment on the proposals willappear in the Federal Register soon.   Initially, the program would focus on the motor-vehicleair conditioning industry, which accounts for 21% of CFC usein the U.S. The agency estimates that 63% of CFC use in theU.S. occurs in industries where recycling is feasible.</TEXT></DOC>
