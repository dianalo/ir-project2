The Video Privacy Protection Act was approved by voice vote andsent to President Reagan.   The measure, which cleared the Senate last week, was writtenafter a weekly Washington, D.C., newspaper obtained and publishedthe video rental records of Bork, whose nomination was the subjectof a lengthy and bitter battle in the Senate.   Bork and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which wasconducting the nomination hearing, expressed outrage at what theysaid was a violation of Bork's privacy.
