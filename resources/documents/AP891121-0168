The Iranian-born Hakim admitted that he had helped supplementthe salary of ex-White House aide Oliver North by paying for asecurity fence at North's home with funds from ``the Enterprise,''the complex of foreign companies Hakim operated in the Iran-Contrascandal.   Lake Resources Inc., a Swiss company used as a conduit for Iranarms sale money and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, pleaded guiltyto theft of government property, a felony carrying a maximumpenalty of up to $500,000.   Hakim, who faces sentencing Feb. 1, could face up to a year injail and a $100,000 fine. It is illegal to supplement the salariesof government employees.   U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell initially rejected theproposed plea agreement, calling it a ``charade'' and complainingthat the U.S. government wasn't being given an opportunity torecover the diverted money.   But after meeting with prosecutors and defense attorneys, Gesellreturned to the courtroom and accepted the pleas, which wereaccompanied by a plea agreement slightly altered at his request.   Outside the courtroom, associate independent counsel StuartAbrams said the plea agreement with Lake Resources, now a papercompany with no assets, does not keep the government from seekingrestitution.   Some $3.8 million from the administration's secret arms sales toIran was funneled to the rebel force during a congressional ban onU.S. military aid to the Contras.   About $8 million from the maze of companies operated by Hakimand his business partner Richard Secord remain frozen in Swiss bankaccounts which the two men formerly controlled. The funds came fromthird-country contributions to the Contras, private fund-raisingefforts in the United States and the secret arms sales.   The plea agreement filed with the court by the government saysthat from late 1985 to November 1986, Hakim, his business partnerRichard Secord, North and national security adviser John Poindexterused their influence ``to generate and divert approxmiately $16.2million ... to Enterprise bank accounts.''   Hakim agreed to cooperate with the investigation by independentcounsel Lawrence Walsh, to testify at pending trials and to supplyfinancial records and other documents.   In North's case, the $13,000 security fence and other equipmentconstituted an illegal gratuity and his acceptance of it was one ofthe three felony counts for which North was convicted.   Hakim, answering Gesell's question ``what was it'' that Northgot, said the security fence was installed ``for the protection ofCol. North ... from terrorist attacks.'' A terrorist organizationrun by Abu Nidal had threatened to kill North, acording tocongressional testimony.   Asked how he concealed the gift, Hakim said ``By maintaining ...bank accounts in a secret manner.''   Hakim's other answers were brief ``Yes, your honor'' or ``No,your honor'' responses.   In another Iran-Contra development, Former President Reagan'sattorneys were granted a two-week delay by U.S. District JudgeHarold H. Greene for consideration of a court challenge to asubpoena asking Reagan to produce documents and testify at thetrial of his former national security adviser, John M. Poindexter,who was North's boss.   Reagan's attorneys said the subpoena ``raises novel and complexconstitutional issues'' about the power of courts over a formerchief executive.   ``We disagree with'' Gesell's characterization of the agreementas a charade, said Abrams.   He said negotiations were under way on an unspecified civilmatter which could affect restitution to the U.S. government.   Abrams said Gesell will be able to conduct a hearing onrestitution and ``whether Lake Resources transferred funds'' toother corporations ``so that someone else could be liable'' forreturning the money to the United States.   Hakim ``got rid of his assets to keep anybody from findingthem,'' complained Gesell. The judge said, ``I am not anxious toconduct a trial to determine what happened'' to the money and saidthe plea agreement should answer the questions of ``who divertedthe money ... who is responsible.''   ``I am not getting an admission here of anything except 100bucks,'' Gesell said in regard to the corporate guilty plea.   The plea agreement specifies that Lake Resources is charged withconverting to its own use property of the United States worth morethan $100.   Before meeting privately with prosecutors and defense attorneys,Gesell said in court that ``You can't fancy-dance through theparagraphs.''   If there is ``a fancy dance,'' he said, ``there is no point inpleading.''   The judge called the proposed agreement ``simply publicrelations efforts that don't have any place in a court.''   At Gesell's request, two paragraphs were dropped from theagreement concerning Hakim's guilty plea. They would have preservedHakim's rights to appeal an adverse decision by Gesell on a motionthat has been pending since last June.</TEXT></DOC>
