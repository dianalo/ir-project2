It could happen to any of us, so we have to learn to take careof ourselves,&quot; said Donna Taylor, who lives less than a block from the housethat burned.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NO WATER TO FIGHT FIRE WORRIES M.H. RESIDENTS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;It's scary,&quot; said Michelle Harvick. She said she and her neighbors aregoing to hold fire drills and buy pumps that can extract water from swimmingpools. The inability of firefighters to draw water from pools Saturday hasupset the neighborhood, she said.;    Harvick is one of six residents,including fire victim Robert Walker, who live along Louis Holstrom Drive andwho share a well and a 40,000-gallon water tank. Other residents along thestreet and nearby streets have their own wells or share wells.;    The welland water tank she shares is enough for ordinary use, except occasionally wheneveryone wants to water their yards at the same time, Harvick said.;    ButSaturday night, the tank ran dry and the pump couldn't draw water from thewell fast enough for firefighters battling the blaze, which had engulfedWalker's house at 2165 Louis Holstrom Drive.;    The fire erupted just before10 p.m. when gasoline-soaked rags tossed in a shed ignited and spread quicklyto the house, said Jack Clark, an inspector for the California Department ofForestry and Fire Protection.;    Clark estimated the value of the house,which was destroyed, at $450,000 and the damage to contents at $150,000.;   Although many residents in the area have swimming pools, the fire enginesbelonging to the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the SouthSanta Clara County Fire District that responded to the Holstrom Drive firedidn't have pumps to draw water from such sources.;    When the communal watertank and their own tanker truck ran dry, firefighters could do nothing butjoin residents in watching the blaze consume the house.;    Taylor and herneighbors are irate.;    &quot;People are told that a swimming pool is a line ofdefense against fire. It's incredible that they don't have equipment to makeuse of the water available,&quot; Taylor said.;    It's not quite so simple, Clarksaid.;    Fire engines that operate in residential areas don't carry pumpsthat can take water from stock ponds or creeks because they aren't used much,Clark said. Additionally, he said, they don't provide a big volume of waterand they take up room on engines that is better used for CPR equipment or thehydraulically operated Jaws of Life used to pry accident victims fromvehicles.;    Will Remily, a Santa Clara County deputy fire marshal, saidsubdivisions built since 1978 are required to have a 60,000-gallon water tank.But developers can't be forced to retrofit their projects, he said.;   Development along Louis Holstrom Drive and neighboring Green Acres Lane goesback about 15 years.;    Remily said upgrading fire protection in older ruralsubdivisions is the responsibility of the residents.;    Final arrangementsfor a meeting of residents have not yet been made.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DALE RODEBAUGH, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  South County  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910618  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  525  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday June 18, 199100170117,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
