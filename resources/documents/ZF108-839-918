(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>ByandM;Mark L. Van Name and Bill CatchingsandM;One of the sad truths of computing is that hard disks are never big enough orfast enough.andP;  Nowhere is this more true than on LAN servers, where growinguser requirements frequently run smack into disk limitations and forceadministrators to consider upgrading.andM;When server disks begin to run out of space or start to performinade-quately, the warning signs are usually obvious.andP;  Users don't have thespace they need to save files.andP;  Administrators respond by asking users todelete unnecessary files.andP;  The time between these &quot;disk-cleaning&quot; cyclesgrows shorter.andP;  Meanwhile, as the disk fills, file operations can slow down.andM;At this point, upgrading is certainly necessary, but it is also somewhat toolate.andP;  In stead of waiting for these signs, administrators should constantlymonitor disk-space usage.andP;  When a disk reaches 85 percent to 90 percent ofits capacity, it's time to plan an upgrade.andM;That's not to say that administrators shouldn't urge users to deleteunnecessary files.andP;  But when the disk reaches the 85 percent to 90 percentmark, even significant cleaning is unlikely to postpone an upgrade for long.andM;Server disks that grow beyond this point are likely to have both storage andperformance problems.andP;  Any significant user file activity is likely to fillthe remaining space, and disks this full tend to become fragmented.andO;Fragmentation affects disk performance by lengthening the time needed both toread and to write files.andP;  When a disk has lots of free space, each of itsfiles tends to occupy consecutive disk sectors.andP;  File reads can often proceedquickly, starting at the first sector of the file and reading each of thesectors in turn, never having to look elsewhere on the disk for parts of thefile.andP;  File writes are also quick, because all that's necessary is toallocate the right number of contiguous sectors and copy the file to them.andM;A fragmented disk, by contrast, has scattered free space, with few largegroups of free consecutive sectors.andP;  A file read often will require accessingsectors from all over the disk, which is a relatively slow, multistepoperation.andP;  Similarly, file writes may require storing pieces of the file allover the disk.andM;Server hard disks can also present another kind of performance problem:bottlenecks.andP;  If all the network users are working with a single disk, eitherthe disk itself or its controller can become unable to keep up with theincoming file requests.andP;  By adding another disk and/or controller, theadministrator can spread the user load around, decreasing the demand on anyone disk or controller.andM;Whether performance or storage requirements make upgrading desirable, whenthe time comes, there are many options but only two basic approaches: buy thenew storage from the manufacturer of the server, or get it from a thirdparty.andM;Going with the original server vendor is the easiest solution.andP;  That vendoris likely to offer only the disks it has already tested with the server.andO;Also, the vendor, or its dealers, are probably willing to install and servicethe new hard disk.andM;Virtually all system vendors offer disk upgrades.andP;  A brief look at theoptions available for a sampling of 386-based servers from three popularvendors -- 3Com Corp., IBM and Compaq Computer Corp. -- illustrates the rangeof choices.andM;3Com Corp.'s 3Server/500 comes with a tape drive and disk as large as 630Mbytes.andP;  Its internal expansion capacity is rather limited, because the onlyway to add a second 630M-byte disk is to remove the tape drive -- obviouslyan undesirable move in many cases.andP;  3Com also offers an external expansionunit that can house two 630M-byte drives.andP;  The 3Server/500 can support fivesuch external units, for a total maximum disk storage of 1.26G bytesinternally and 6.3G bytes externally.andM;IBM's PS/2 Model 80, by contrast, is a tower unit with several internal diskbays.andP;  Unfortunately, the largest disk IBM offers for this system holds only320M bytes.andP;  Assuming the system has no tape drives, it can hold four suchdrives, for a total internal capacity of 1.28G bytes.andM;Compaq's Systempro is also a tower unit with plenty of drive bays.andP;  It usesCompaq's proprietary Intelligent Drive Array (IDA) technology for itsstandard disks.andP;  IDA drives come in pairs of either 120M- or 210M-bytedrives, for 240M bytes or 420M bytes per pair.andP;  The tower can hold four suchpairs, for a maximum internal storage of 1.68G bytes.andP;  The Systempro also hasdrive bays that can hold conventional hard disks, and Compaq offers anexternal chassis that can house more IDA drives.andM;All three systems have similar internal storage limits: around 1.5G bytes.andO;Although this much disk space on a microcomputer might have seemed absurdeven five years ago, for many organizations it's no longer enough.andM;All these vendors recognize this need and plan to increase the diskcapacities of their servers.andP;  Perhaps the most ambitious of the bunch isCompaq, which recently announced plans to offer up to 40G bytes of diskstorage for the Systempro.andM;Third-party vendors, aware of the limitations of these servers, offeradditional internal and external disk upgrade options.andP;  These companies oftensell larger and far less expensive disks than vendors do.andM;Organizations that turn to third-party disk vendors often must install andset up the new disks themselves; although some dealers will help with thistask, the server vendor is unlikely to lend a hand.andM;Fortunately, many third-party disk vendors go out of their way to make suchupgrades as painless as possible.andP;  For example, Advanced Digital InformationCorp. offers internal disks and controllers that have been formatted for usein Novell NetWare LAN servers.andP;  Those disks are also significantly cheaperthan server vendors' disks.andM;Some third-party vendors offer external disk subsystems for organizationswhose servers have no open internal expansion bays.andP;  Tense Lectronix Corp.,andO;for example, sells the M.A.S.S.andP;  Legacy external tower, which can house six1.05G-byte drives, for a total capacity of 6.3G bytes per tower.andM;When More Is BetterandM;Although additional disks can increase server storage space regardless oftheir source, sometimes performance requirements also mandate additionalcontrollers.andM;Each disk works only with certain types of controllers, so matching the diskwith the controller upgrade is crucial.andP;  To maximize server performance, itis also important to choose the right type of controller.andM;The first AT-compatible hard disks used ST506 controllers.andP;  Those controllerswere adequate in the days of 8MHz 286 CPUs, but today they are the slowest ofthe commonly available controllers.andP;  In their place in today'shigh-performance disk subsystems are Enhanced Small-Device Interface (ESDI)and Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) controllers and drives, whichsupport significantly faster data transfers than the ST506 subsystems.andM;Some ESDI and SCSI controllers further improve disk performance by cachingdisk data.andP;  (See related story, Page S/37.) These controllers use their ownon-board processor and memory, which can range from 32K bytes to 4M bytes ormore, to store copies of recently read disk sectors.andP;  Subsequent reads ofthose sectors can get the data from the cache memory and bypass the disk.andO;Intelligent caching controllers will often fetch even the disk sectorfollowing the one just read in anticipation of a future request for thatsector.andM;Disk writes can also benefit from caching, as the system has to write thedata only to the cache before returning to work; the processor on thecontroller takes care of getting the data from the cache to the disk.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
