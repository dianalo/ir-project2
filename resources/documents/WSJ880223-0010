The increase posted by the British defense and engineering group was above analysts' expectations, and Vickers rose nine pence (15.8 cents), to 166 pence, on London's stock exchange yesterday.    Net income increased 36%, to #42.3 million from #31.1 million. Sales grew 14%, to #788.3 million from #691.8 million.    Analysts had predicted pretax profit of between #60 million and #62 million, below the #62.6 million reported. They had reduced profit forecasts after Vickers indicated that its medical- and scientific-equipment division was hurt by a decline in U.S. demand in the fourth quarter.    In yesterday's report, Vickers said that operating profit in the division rose 28%, to #6 million from #4.7 million, but that the improved performance was &quot;somewhat restrained&quot; by a downturn in U.S. demand.    The &quot;outstanding achievement&quot; in 1987, Vickers said, was recorded by the Rolls-Royce auto division. Despite the weak dollar and the stock-market crash, operating profit increased 26%, to #22 million from #17.5 million.    Vickers said it will sell its business-furniture division, which had trading difficulties in the French and U.S. markets. </TEXT></DOC>
