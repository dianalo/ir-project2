The Senate Judiciary Committee also heard an estimate fromformer Pittsburgh Steeler Steve Courson that at least half of proplayers at so-called line-of-scrimmage positions use steroids.   The estimates made by the two players, however, were disputed bytwo head coaches who also appeared as witnesses, MartySchottenheimer of the Kansas City Chiefs and Chuck Noll of theSteelers.   It was the committee's second hearing this year on themuscle-building substances, initially used by body builders andpower lifters, which were introduced into the NFL in the 1960s whenweight training became commonplace.   A bill to ban steroids from the mail and designate them acontrolled substance like narcotic drugs has been introduced bycommittee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., and member Sen. StromThurmond, R-S.C.   But witnesses could not agree on how widespread the problem is.   NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle cited an official league estimatethat 6 percent to 7 percent of players use steroids, but concededthat figure might not be accurate.   ``I thought that's a low figure ... I thought it might behigher,'' Rozelle said.   Biden asked Schottenheimer and Noll to comment on estimates that50 percent to 70 percent of NFL players use steroids.   ``I would have difficulty, Senator, in imagining that it wouldbe that high,'' said Schottenheimer.   ``I can't imagine that figure as being completely accurate,''said Noll.   But Fralic estimated that ``exclusive of quarterbacks, runningbacks and wide receivers, it's probably 75 percent.'' He saidsteroid use was far more prevalant among offensive linemen,defensive linemen, linebackers and tight ends.   Courson also said positions requiring bulk and muscle along theline of scrimmage are the ones with the most steroid users _ atleast 50 percent among linemen.   ``NFL owners can't grasp this problem,'' Fralic said. ``Theyhaven't been living in the middle of the steroid madness. Theycan't see their friends affected by it.''   He also charged that ``coaches at every level turn their back tothe steroids situation.   ``High school coaches are trying to build an impressive recordfor their resume or to build their status within a community,''Fralic said. ``College coaches face tremendous pressure to win. Andpro coaches are judged on only one basis, their win-loss record.The cycle keeps repeating itself and a monster problem is growing.''   Noll expressed doubts that steroids actually benefit players.   But both players, as well as coaches Joe Paterno of Penn Stateand Bo Schembechler of Michigan, told the committee that steroidsdo enhance performance.   ``I could not tell you for sure that we do not have kids takingsteroids,'' Paterno said, despite the presence of a universitytesting program.   He said Penn State is considering inserting a steroids clauseinto its game contracts with other schools in an effort to avoidplacing the Nittany Lions in competition with teams with an unfairchemical advantage.   In other testimony, Gene Upshaw, executive director of theNational Football League Players Association, told the panel a pollof players indicated that 75 percent of the union opposes randomtesting for steroid use.   Fralic, however, said his own poll of the Falcons showed 80percent of the players would go along with random testing. The 20percent who opposed such testing feared how management mightrespond to positive tests, he said.   Steroids are illegal if bought, sold or imported without aprescription. Health experts say prolonged use of the drug withoutproper supervision can contribute to heart trouble, sexual andreproductive disorders, immune deficiencies, liver problems,psychological disturbances and growth disorders.</TEXT></DOC>
