The regional Bell phone companies and the Federal CommunicationsCommission rejected the report's findings that phone rates haveballooned since the ATandamp;T divestiture while the spin-off companiesearn excessive profits.   ``Service has never been better. The percentage of homes with aphone has never been higher,'' said BellSouth, one of seven regionalBell companies spun off from American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. inthe breakup five years ago.   The federation's annual report on phone service, releasedWednesday, said telephone service is no longer the consumer bargainit once was.   Overall phone rates, which rose at less than one-third the rateof general inflation in the 50 years before divestiture, have beenrising as fast as inflation since then, the report says.   Local rates followed the same pre-divestiture trend as overallrates, but after the breakup, local rates have climbed twice as fastas inflation, the study said. Much of the increase resulted from acharge imposed by federal regulators that now costs each residentialsubscriber $3.20 per month. It was intended to reduce long-distancesubsidies of the local phone network.   Inflation-adjusted local rates are up 25 to 35 percent, whilelong-distance rates have dropped 43 percent, the report said.However, most Americans make too few interstate calls to offset thehigher local rates, according to the federation.   ``Segments of the telephone industry used the Bell breakup as aTrojan horse to conceal their assault on one of the best consumerbargains of modern times,'' said Gene Kimmelman, author of thereport from the Washington-based federation, which claims to be thenation's largest consumer advocacy group.   ``Had we preserved traditional regulation, consumers would bepaying about $4 per month less for local service, and ratepayerswould be saving $1 (billion) to $2 billion dollars each year,'' hesaid.   BellSouth said the report ``lumps out-of-date statistics in anattempt to plant inaccuracies in the minds of customers'' andcharged Kimmelman with ``juggling the figures.''   Gerald Brock, the FCC's top telephone official, said the reportwas ``intentionally misleading ... it is an attempt to put togetherfigures that have no relevance to each other to show a trend thatdoesn't exist.''   He said a ``substantial portion'' of the local rate increasesgranted by the states to Bell companies after they were spun offfrom ATandamp;T resulted from the companies writing off old equipment andfacilities. He said that caused an increase in prices, ``but thatwas going to happen at some time.''   ``We are now seeing real telephone rates decline,'' he said,citing government figures showing the Consumer Price Index for localand long-distance phone service declined 1.3 percent in 1987 anddropped 0.1 percent this year.   Bell Atlantic said none of its local phone companies has had ageneral rate increase since October 1985 and ``rates for manyservices have been reduced.''   ``Prices have stabilized and the trend is down,'' said DanBehuniak, a Bell Atlantic assistant vice president.   The divestiture separated ATandamp;T's long-distance operations fromits monopoly local Bell units. The local companies were formed intoseven regional holding companies that operate extensive local phonenetworks.   Since the breakup, the report said, these Bell companies haveearned higher profits that are ``far out of line with historicalBell system earnings and the current marketplace.''</TEXT></DOC>
