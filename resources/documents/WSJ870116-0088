The November drop in inventories, which followed a sharp 0.6% rise in October, put the ratio of inventories to sales at 1.35, down from 1.36 in October. Business sales fell a revised 1.4% in October. The drop previously was reported as 1.6%.    The statistics suggest that inventory building won't provide as much of a boost to fourth-quarter economic growth as many analysts had expected following the October inventory rise. However, the 4.4% increase in December retail sales reported earlier this week suggests that fourth-quarter consumer spending may not show as big a decline from the third quarter as previously expected.    Retail inventories posted the biggest drop in November, falling 0.7% after a 2.8% increase in October. Within that category, auto inventories declined 1.8% after a 9.8% surge in October. Manufacturers' inventories rose 0.2% after falling 0.2%. Wholesale stocks dropped 0.3% after a 0.5% decline.    Here is a summary of the Commerce Department's report on business inventories and sales in November.
