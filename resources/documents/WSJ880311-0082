He becomes the sixth prominent British businessman, including former Guinness Chairman Ernest Saunders, to be arrested as part of an investigation into the giant brewing and distilling company's #2.53 billion ($4.67 billion) bid for Distillers. Further arrests are expected.    Separately, Guinness said it may receive only $25.5 million of $100 million it invested weeks after the Distillers takeover in a partnership created by U.S. financier Ivan Boesky. The investment apparently was in return for Mr. Boesky's purchases of Distillers shares during the bid. In March 1987, Guinness's new management sued Mr. Boesky for return of the $100 million.    Late yesterday, Lord Spens was charged with falsifying documents related to the purchase of Guinness shares during the Distillers bid and conspiring to create a false market in Guinness shares, according to the London Metropolitan Police. Police said the allegations relate to Lord Spens's role in arranging a purchase of Guinness shares shortly after the Distillers takeover.    A lawyer for Lord Spens said the businessman &quot;emphatically denied&quot; the allegations. Lord Spens will appear in court this morning to respond to the charges.    Since December 1986, the British government and police have been investigating whether improper share-price manipulation or other possibly illegal tactics helped Guinness's Distiller bid, which was composed mainly of stock, to succeed. A 25% jump in Guinness's share price during the late stages of the bid drove the offer's value above a competing bid by Argyll Group PLC.    The charges against Lord Spens relate to his alleged role in Ansbacher's #7.6 million purchase of 2.15 million Guinness shares shortly after the success of Guinness's offer in April 1986. The purchase likely helped boost Guinness's share price at a time when others who had purchased its shares during the Distillers bid were concerned about a loss on their investment.    Lord Spens, then Ansbacher's head of corporate finance, allegedly falsified documents to conceal that Guinness had funded the share purchase, according to yesterday's charges. The payment allegedly was recorded as an &quot;interest-free deposit&quot; with Ansbacher. It is illegal in Britain for a company to buy its own shares or give financial support to others to buy them without shareholder approval.    Lord Spens also allegedly concealed the fact that Guinness would indemnify Ansbacher against losses in any subsequent sale of the shares, the charges stated.    In January 1987, Lord Spens resigned from Ansbacher, apparently at the Bank of England's urging. Soon after, new management at Guinness demanded that Ansbacher return the money and threatened to sue Ansbacher if the &quot;deposit&quot; wasn't returned. Since leaving Ansbacher, Lord Spens, 45 years old, has run his own corporate-finance business in London.    Last May, Ansbacher agreed to share with Morgan Grenfell andamp; Co. -- the merchant-banking unit of Morgan Grenfell Group PLC and Guinness's financial adviser during the bid -- the about #300,000 in losses from the sale of the 2.15 million Guinness shares. Ansbacher previously had said it acted on Morgan Grenfell's instructions in buying the shares. Ansbacher officials declined to comment yesterday on Lord Spens's arrest.    Besides Mr. Saunders, three people were charged last year with offenses related to the government investigation. These include Gerald Ronson, chairman of closely held British company Heron International PLC; Roger Seelig, a former corporate-finance director at Morgan Grenfell and Co.; and British businessman Sir Jack Lyons. In addition, the British government is seeking to extradite and bring charges against British stockbroker Anthony Parnes, arrested in the U.S. last year.    Hearings are set for next month on whether enough evidence exists to try the previously charged businessmen. A Los Angeles hearing on Mr. Parnes's extradition is scheduled for March 22.    In the Boesky matter, Guinness said it would recover at least $25.5 million of its investment under a proposed settlement with CX Partners L.P., successors to Mr. Boesky's limited partnership. That amount could increase. The agreement must win approval from the limited partners of CX Partners.    Guinness will receive the $25.5 million under a plan calling for the distribution of much of the $302 million remaining in Mr. Boesky's investment partnership. Mr. Boesky's limited partners will receive $209 million, with the remaining funds being held in reserve for possible claims, according to George Reycraft, a lawyer for 42 of the limited partners. The limited partners continue to press a lawsuit in New York federal court against Mr. Boesky and others for repayment of the full $338 million they invested, plus interest.    In addition, British investment trust Cambrian andamp; General Securities PLC, formerly controlled by Mr. Boesky, said a partnership owned by Cambrian would receive $9 million of the $20 million it invested in the same Boesky partnership in 1986. Under the partial distribution, Guinness and Cambrian will receive a smaller share of their investment than other limited partners. Other limited partners had argued that Guinness and Cambrian were tainted by the investigation and therefore shouldn't receive equal treatment. </TEXT></DOC>
