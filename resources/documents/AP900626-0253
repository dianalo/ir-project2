CBS has ``no comment'' on the request, said CBS spokeswomanSusan Tick in Los Angeles, where the network's top executives areattending the annual CBS affiliates convention this week.   Last week, Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cablesystem operator, asked NBC to let its systems become NBC affiliatesin some cities that have no NBC-affiliated broadcast station.   However, that cable company didn't specify which cities it hadin mind. NBC Cable and Business Development president Thomas S.Rogers said NBC didn't think TCI's request was serious. A TCIofficial said it was.   Frank Anthony, senior vice-president for Continental, thenation's fourth-largest cable operation, said his company's CBSproposal wasn't prompted by TCI's earlier action, but ``it helpedus crystallize our thinking.''   ``Our proposal is much more specific,'' he added. ``We'retalking about a distinct market which does not have a CBS affiliatein it.''   New Hampshire is among states with a higher-than-average numberof cable households. According to A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates, 62percent of its 410,000 television households have cable.   CBS broadcasts received in Concord now come from CBS affiliatesWHDH-TV in Boston and WGME-TV in Portland, Me., Anthony said.Concord briefly had a CBS-affiliated UHF station in 1988, but thatoutlet went out of business, he said.   He said his Boston-based company asked to become CBS' affiliatein Concord because of the network's strength, ``its solid newsoperation'' and because CBS ``had already recognized the (Concord)market as being somewhat underserved.''   If its request were granted, Continental wouldn't drop theBoston and Portland affiliate signals from its Concord cableoperation, he said.   But as a local CBS affiliate, that operation, deriving itsincome from local advertising and cable subscriptions, wouldfunction as does as an over-the-air CBS affiliate.   That includes payments from CBS for carrying the network'sshows, Anthony said.   Although CBS officials declined comment on Continental'srequest, it is doubtful they would grant it.   Among other things, they have repeatedly said their company hasno interest in cable and that CBS' core business is broadcasting.   Anthony, who said Continental has yet to receive a reply fromCBS, said network affiliation requests from cable companies couldbecome commonplace.   ``I think they could,'' he said. ``But I think for CBS oranybody else to consider them, they need to be serious proposals''to serve markets that don't now have network-affiliated stations oftheir own.</TEXT></DOC>
