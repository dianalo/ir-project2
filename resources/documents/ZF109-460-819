(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>INFORMATION ENGINEERS WANTED TO BUILD ENTERPRISE MODELSandM;When corporate management asks MIS management to explain why their projectsare late and over budget, a language barrier often prevents them fromunderstanding each other.andP;  The CEO's prime focus is on business concerns,such as productivity and quality, while the systems manager's main concern istechnology.andM;Companies today are challenged to exploit technology to help accomplishbusiness goals.andM;In order to do so, the MIS profession needs to change its focus from&quot;technology&quot; to &quot;business.&quot;andP;  MIS professionals need to become businessprofessionals first.andP;  Similarly, users and their management need to getinvolved with &quot;computers&quot; as an integral part of their business.andM;A methodology offering a common ground is computer-aided software engineering(Case).andP;  Case is not only a direction of data processing, but is part of anoverall business management movement that focuses on quality and productivityas a means to improve our competitive situation in the world market.andM;&quot;Case is a fundamental paradigm shift in the business of data processing,&quot;said Donna Rund, an information engineering manager for Levi Strauss andamp; Co. inSan Francisco.andP;  &quot;[It entails] fundamental changes to what data processing isall about.&quot;andM;Indeed, it entails fundamental changes to how businesses approach MIS.andP;  Thesechanges promise to impact skill sets, personality profiles, organizationalstructures, ideas of specialization and career paths.andP;  In short, MIS isfacing culture shock.andM;Mary Rich, an expert in enterprise modeling and an independent consultantfrom the Los Angeles area, said, &quot;The key to success doesn't really depend onthe tools.andP;  There are lots of good tools.andP;  It depends on developing a culturein which they can be [effectively] used.&quot;andM;Software developers and managers of DP who are looking toward Case as acure-all should keep this in mind: The underlying message of Case isproductivity and quality.andP;  It's central theme is not about technologicalsophistry or even running faster.andM;In my revised story of the race between the tortoise and the hare, the harenever falls asleep, but still loses the race.andP;  Although the hare runs atspeeds in the Mach range, he never takes the time to plan his race route.andP;  Infact, he never knows where the finish line is.andP;  His philosophy is that if heruns fast enough, he will impress the crowd and eventually find the finishline.andP;  He never does.andM;The tortoise, on the other hand, operates at subsloth speeds.andP;  When the gungoes off to start the race, he does not start running.andP;  Instead, he gets outsome maps and asks race officials and aficionados where the finish line is(the goal).andP;  Only when he has a reasonable plan does he start the race.andP;  Hewins, hands (or is it claws?) down.andM;The story of the tortoise and the hare is one of efficiency andeffectiveness.andP;  The hare was efficient.andP;  He did things right!andP;  He ran fast!andO;The tortoise was effective.andP;  He did the right thing!andP;  He went directly togoal!andM;Case products can be used to achieve efficiency.andP;  Developers can programfaster.andP;  Database managers can build databases faster.andP;  However, AndrewGalat, senior partner, CSC Partners, a consulting firm in Oak Brook, Ill.,andO;suggests that the implementation of Case products may actually result indoing things slower, but better.andM;LIFE-CYCLE COSTINGandM;A spokesperson from a firm trying to improve its implementation of dataadministration said, &quot;We get gold stars for delivering systems on time andwithin budget, not for integration.&quot;andP;  Could this firm, which did not want tobe identified, have used Case?andP;  They are in fact using data modeling andfunctional modeling which are key components of Case products.andP;  But it is&quot;magic&quot; modeling for a &quot;pilot&quot; project with a narrowly defined scope.andP;  It isbeing done in the back room by lower-level analysts, without much userparticipation.andM;The pilot project may produce an application of higher quality withinnarrowly defined concepts.andP;  For example, the supporting databases may be&quot;pseudonormalized.&quot;andP;  But it is doubtful that any significant integration willoccur.andP;  Instead, another &quot;island of automation&quot; will be created.andM;A few years ago, my family decided to buy a new dishwasher.andP;  The price tag onthe one we wanted was much more than most other brands.andP;  We bought the &quot;moreexpensive&quot; brand because we felt the life cycle of that dishwasher was muchlonger than the cheaper brands.andP;  We also calculated that the maintenancecosts would be lower, the aggravation less and the dishes washed better.andP;  Wewere thinking in terms of the cost of a dishwasher over its life cycle--thatis, life-cycle costing--not of the cheapest purchase price.andM;Life-cycle costing is well-established concept among quality engineers, suchas Joseph M. Juran and W. Edward Deming, Americans who taught the Japaneseabout quality after World War II.andP;  The Japanese have made hay (at ourexpense) with this concept.andP;  Essentially, what the Japanese believe is that&quot;quality is productivity&quot; and vice versa.andM;In the information systems (IS) development world, two pertinent andstartling figures have been bandied about for years: 80% of MIS developmentresources are consumed by maintenance and enhancements to existing systems;and 80% of the cost of systems maintenance is traceable to requirements(either faulty or changing).andP;  Yet, estimates for systems or database projectsdo not factor in the costs of maintenance.andM;Buying into Case means buying into a philosophy.andP;  The technology isimportant, but secondary.andP;  The underlying theme of Case is the same as theunderlying theme of world-famous quality engineers: that is, quality isproductivity.andM;A company turning to Case must be ready for this philosophical shift.andM;According to Juran, quality means that the goods and services delivered to acustomer are usable--the first time.andP;  This idea is central to qualityprograms such as &quot;zero defects.&quot;andM;To put quality into a more significant context, Juran said that to somedegree a customer always values quality, delivery and price.andP;  In short, acustomer wants a usable product, delivered &quot;just in time&quot; at a fair andcompetitive price.andM;Businesses that fail to deliver what their customers value will sonn findthemselves out of business.andP;  Many businesses do not make the effort tounderstand how the customer uses the product.andP;  Thus, a business' qualityspecs often reflect their own perspective of quality, rather than thecustomer's.andM;USERS ARE CUSTOMERSandM;A DP organization must realize that its users are customers.andP;  In themid-'70s, as an MIS manager, I was given the task of establishing aninformation center at my firm.andP;  The idea was to give the users access to thedata they needed to produce reports when they wanted them and in the formthey wanted.andP;  Basically, the information center provided training andhand-holding.andP;  We would not write programs for the users.andP;  They had to investtime and effort into this endeavor if they wanted to share in its benefits.andO;The users loved it.andP;  In the first year of operation, over 100 users had beentrained and over 50 users were actively programming in the query languages.andM;Like most MIS departments, we had a huge backlog of &quot;systems servicerequests.&quot;andP;  The information center was supposed to address this backlog.andO;Actually, many users had stopped submitting these requests, because they knewthey would never be serviced.andP;  A longer-term goal was to increase the&quot;computer literacy&quot; of the user community, essentially to improve thecommunications between MIS and the user community.andM;The MIS community resisted.andP;  The attituse was reactive, not proactive.andP;  MISprofessionals were guarding their fiefdoms.andP;  Cleary, to some, users were notcustomers.andM;The same scenario took place when personal computers first hit corporateAmerica.andP;  The MIS folks were scurrying to implement &quot;corporate standards&quot;that would essentially give them veto power over whether a user could buy aPC.andP;  They wanted to maintain control over the introduction and management ofcomputers within the corporation.andM;A DP organization should seek out its markets.andP;  Instead, MIS tends to spendtime classifying requests as either maintenance or enhancement.andP;  Usersproperly regard this behavior as defensive.andP;  They see no value added by theseclassifications, but rather a scheme to fix blame.andM;Case vendors such as: Oracle, Belmont, Calif.; KnowledgeWare, Atlanta; andTexas Instruments, Plano, Texas, share some viewpoints:andM;* The belief that systems and databases need to be tied explicitly tobusiness goals, objectives and plans.andM;* The need for a broad-based, overall architecture/blueprint for development.andO;This architecture is cross-functional and models how things fit together(integrate) in an enterprise.andM;* Development projects will be phased, reflecting an orientation to large,complex information systems.andM;PLATFORM-INDEPENDENT DESIGNandM;The Case approach promotes the idea of a platform-independent design.andP;  Withthis approach, design is split into two phases: logical and physical.andM;A logical design is free of technological constraints and assumes perfecttechnology; that is, computers are as fast and reliable as you need, theycost nothing and communications is not an issue (and thus there are nodistribution issues).andM;Although these assumptions are ludicrous, advantages to this approachinclude:andM;* A large portion of the systems and database specifications can beeffectively and efficiently reused, regardless of platform.andP;  For example, aconversion from IMS to DB2 could be made relatively painlessly.andM;* The design is easier to communicate with non-DP professionals, because itis free of a lot of the technical jargon.andP;  At the same time, however, itintroduces various functional and data modeling jargon.andM;* Assuming that the Case products can capture all or most of the knowledgenecessary to make various logical-physical transformations (with the additionof some metrics), then reliable, error-free programs and database definitionscan be automatically generated (and regenerated).andM;* It frees software developers of the burden of knowing all theeccentricities of various technical approaches.andM;Texas Instruments claims that its IEF Case tool has generated over sixmillion lines of code without a defect.andP;  That is an outstanding claim.andM;Mike Watters, vice president, general manager, Advanced InformationManagement Division, Texas Instruments, in commenting to the press aboutIBM's AD/Cycle, said &quot;It's important that the application developmentenvironment be as separate from the 'technology environment' or 'platforms'as it can be.andP;  If I am a heterogeneous DP shop, I might have an IBMmainframe, an HP or DEC minicomputer and maybe a Sun workstation--multiplehardware and operating systems.andP;  What is needed is an application environmentthat is consistent across all of those technologies.&quot;andM;What Watters described is the idea and ideal of the Case logical/physicalseparation.andM;The read world is heterogeneous, and will continue to be so.andP;  The fact is,certain platforms are better at certain things.andP;  IBM rules the mainframeworld of administrative data processing.andP;  Desktop publishers prefer the AppleMacintosh, and Digital Equipment Corporation is strong on the manufacturingshop floor.andM;Increasingly, MIS is (rightfully) loosing its stranglehold as the &quot;managersof technology&quot; within the business environment.andM;In such an environment, the logical design becomes the key deliverable, anopposed to technical database definitions and Cobol programs.andP;  Maintenance isthen done to the logical design, not the programs.andM;Programmers and database administrators could perceive a threat from such aphilosophy.andP;  Cloene Goldsborough, director of data resource management atTWA, Kansas City, a TI client using IEF, said, &quot;The emphasis will shift topeople who can do reuirements analysis and design.&quot;andP;  [Software Magazine,September 1989, p. 40.]andM;Steven Barsh, president of SECA, Conshohocken, Pa., which helps companiesimplement Case software, said, &quot;The greatest barriers to software engineeringare cultural rather than technological&quot; and &quot;education is the catalyst.&quot;andM;According to Barsh, &quot;A broad consensus now exists among MIS managers thatsoftware engineering is both necessary and inevitable, but it is difficult toget the...programmer to go along.andP;  Programming is considered an art, and manyprogrammers resent the formal, documented approach that software engineeringrequires.&quot;andP;  In this case, the cultural problem is to modify the behavior orattitude of programmers.andP;  They must see that creativity is enhanced by a moredisciplined, methodical approach to developing software.andM;Howard Fosdick, an independent consultant from the Chicago area, thinksculture shock has something to do with the reduction of specialization thatCase will make more and more possible.andP;  In short, with Case's internalknowledge about generating code and various control blocks, there will beless of a need for specialists in IMS or CICS, for example.andP;  With the help ofCase tools, analysts will be technically capable of doing more of the totaljob.andM;Consultant Rich said that &quot;developing the culture&quot; in which Case can be usedeffectively may be the big deal of the day.andM;DISCIPLINE COUNTSandM;Discipline, according to Webster, is an &quot;orderly or prescribed conduct orpattern of behavior or a rule, or system of rules governing conduct oractivity.andP;  It is enforcing order.&quot;andM;All Case products use both process and data modeling techniques.andP;  Discipline,in this case, would mean that an enterprise would follow the rules governingthe chosen modeling techniques.andP;  Note also that each Case product has, moreor less, standard deliverables associated with each development phase.andP;  Thisimplies the imposition of order.andM;Methodology takes Case development a step further.andP;  Webster definesmethodology as &quot;a body of methods, rules and postulates employed by adiscipline: a particular procedure or set of procedures.&quot;andM;There are different viewpoints on the importance of a particular methodologyin respect to Case products.andP;  TI bundles the components of its Case productand feels that methodology is the cornerstone.andP;  Oracle offers a methodology.andO;Knowledge Ware lists methodology-independence as a benefit of its ApplicationDevelopment Workbench (ADW) product.andM;METHODOLOGY NEEDEDandM;There is some confusion about where methodology ends and modeling techniquesbegin.andP;  Some people refer to a methodology as a step-by-step guideline fordevelopment; others seem to think that the application of a particularmodeling technique is, in itself, a methodology.andM;IBM, with its broad customer base, has promised that AD/Cycle will bemethodology-free.andM;Whatever the particular position on the methodology, it is clear that theimplementation of Case does impose a more disciplined development approach.andO;Case vendors uniformly believe that a client implementing Case needs a goodmethodology.andM;For a firm that values integration, which might well be an overriding reasonto buy into Case, discipline, if not methodology, is essential.andM;On  the other hand, methodologies are a two-edged sword.andP;  Oracle's literaturewarns: &quot;Many mechanistic techniques available today are so repetitious,procedural and boring that good people forget to use their brains and areinhibited from thinking of better ways of doing things.&quot;andM;Firms believing that a methodology will automatically result in a moredisciplined approach are perhaps in for an unpleasant surprise.andP;  Notice thatthe definition of methodology is that it is employed by &quot;a discipline,&quot; notthe other way around.andM;The successful user of a methodology understands the underlying disciplines.andO;We cannot simply describe the &quot;process&quot; that architects go through, if theuser of this process is not an architect.andP;  It does little, if an engineeringdepartment lays out a step-by-step procedure for designing products, if theuser of this methodology is not an engineer of a designer.andM;According to TWA's Goldsborough, &quot;The emphasis will shift to people who cando requirements analysis and design.andP;  We've found that...actiondiagram[s]...can be done very well ...andP;  or very poorly.&quot;andM;Good programmers are not necessarily good analysis.andP;  Usually they lackadequate training in the systems analysis discipline, and sometimes have thewrong personality profile.andP;  On the other hand, many technical people makeexcellent analysts.andP;  Some brilliant analysts will be liberated by the newjobs, which will demand much greater skills in the arena of humaninteraction.andM;An even bigger problem is the lack of expertise in the &quot;discipline&quot; ofsystems architecture or high-level requirements analysis.andM;Levi Strauss recognized that &quot;Case concepts&quot; would have a major impact ontheir environment.andP;  The company believed that the implementation of theseconcepts would create a huge culture shock, and thus required investment inretooling and retraining.andM;The company's Rund believes that all too frequently companies buy software&quot;willy-nilly,&quot; without a vision of where it takes them, or where they aregoing in the greater scheme of things.andP;  She believes that this leads to a DP&quot;feeding frenzy.&quot;andM;In 1987, Levi Strauss developed the &quot;Martinizing Plan.&quot;andP;  A major part of thisplan was to start developing the skill sets necessary in these newdisciplines.andP;  It included developing skills in logical and structured designand data modeling.andM;A key component of the plan included the establishment of a chief informationofficer (CIO) who would understand the company's goals and strategies, andeducate management on how they could use information systems to strategicadvantage.andM;They began changing relationships with users in the development process,getting them involved and establishing partnerships.andM;Within the plan, they began to develop their information engineeringorganization.andP;  This included training and application in the informationengineering tools and methods, and developing the infrastructure to supportintegration across functional project teams.andM;As part of the &quot;Vision program, the company became serious about Casesoftware in 1989.andP;  Levi Strauss wanted software that was full-life-cycle, andhad the capability of porting designs across multiple platforms.andP;  The companychose KnowledgeWare's Information Engineering Workbench because ofKnowledgeWare's commitment to an open architecture.andM;One of the more difficult adjustments is getting across the idea thatprojects cannot be managed independently.andP;  The consequences to otherfunctions have to be considered.andM;The plan's ideals include:andM;* From a corporate standpoint, data should reside in the database only once.andM;* A conscious effort to try not to duplicate business functions.andM;Rund said their strategy entails a &quot;change in the basic assumptions.&quot;andP;  Forexample, the investment strategy is to invest in good, reusable design, notcode.andP;  And the integration of business and process include positioning for&quot;business reengineering.&quot;andM;Consistency, accessibility and availability generally define the qualitycharacteristics of information.andP;  They also define productivity.andP;  This is whatthe application of the Case concept is all about.andM;&quot;ENTERPRISE VIEW&quot; ESSENTIALandM;Some major strategies underlying the goals of Case include integration,business orientation, and asset or resource management.andM;What makes payroll think that there are 4,500 employees, while personnelswears there are 5,000?andP;  They probably count them differently.andP;  There is noshared &quot;enterprise view.&quot;andM;John Flanagan, a partner in Affiliated Business Consultants, who is based inNorthridge, Calif., put it this way: &quot;The computer is a fast and accurateidiot, but it can't handle ambiguity ...andP;  it is incapable, by itself, ofdealing with a language as insidious and ambiguous as English.&quot;andP;  Thisknowledge must be &quot;engineered.&quot;andM;In a &quot;logical design,&quot; the tactics of data (ultimately language) integrationprimarily include the elimination of redundancy and ambiguity in meanings,not storage.andP;  Also, they are used to discover language concepts missing inthe enterprise language.andP;  Presently, the major underlying disciplines aimedat addressing this significant &quot;improvement opportunity&quot; are mathematicallybased in disciplines like relational and predicate calculus.andP;  In Case, theyprimarily take the form of data models.andM;From the process perspective, the strategy is much the same: the eliminationof redundant and overlapping functions.andM;Ultimately, the separation of data and process is unnatural.andP;  Data has nomeaning unless it is put into the context of what a business does.andO;Similarly, a process that does no capture and use data is meaningless.andP;  Dataand process models are just two viewpoints of the same thing: your business.andM;The application of technology without a comprehensive understanding of thebusiness process that it servesandM;often leads to a decrease, rather than an increase, in productivity.andM;Alexander Meikeljohn, an American educator (1872-1964), said, &quot;There is, Ithink, nothing in the world more futile than the attempt to find out how atask should be done, when one has not yet decided what the task is.&quot;andM;What is needed is a professional and disciplined approach to requirements.andO;It must incorporate what management values and address what can be done toachieve those values; that is, business processes, not computer processes.andM;A manufacturing firm devised a process model that expresses the businessviewpoint.andP;  (See Figure 1.)andP;  The high-level process (functional) modelrepresents the firm's viewpoint of its &quot;customer order cycle.&quot;andM;The model was produced by a strategic planning team that consisted of a&quot;partnership&quot; of users, MIS professionals and a &quot;systems architect&quot; (aconsultant who was expert in the discipline and methodology of strategicinformation planning).andM;The team knew that management valued certain things:andM;* Shortening the order cycle.andP;  That meant reducing the time required from acustomer's request for product, until delivery of the goods.andM;* Meeting the customer's delivery schedules 100% of the time.andM;* Meeting or exceeding the customer's quality expectations, thus eliminatingreturns and allowances.andM;* Flexibility in allowing order changes, and being able to accurately tell acustomer the status of an order at all times.andM;* Timely collection of payments.andM;The teAm's mission was to identify those business activities most pertinentto the accomplishment of these goals, seek out pertinent problems andimprovement opportunities, and make recommendations.andP;  The team also had tocome up with a plan for the ultimate implementation of improved businesssystems.andM;The model represents the team's version of those activities that &quot;are mostpertinent to the accomplishment of management's goals.&quot;andM;This particular type of process model is called an IDEF-0; a technique thatis also called activity modeling.andP;  It is popular in the aerospace industry.andO;If it is used well, it is particularly adept at expressing the &quot;businessviewpoint&quot; and contains a lot of pertinent information on a single page.andP;  Itsdrawbacks is that it tends to get too busy.andM;If one is fairly skilled at constructing and reading such a model, pertinentfacts are revealed.andP;  For example, the common purpose or goal of the systemcan be seen in its ultimate outputs; e.g., deliveries (shipments) and bills.andO;Critical success factors commonly are those major &quot;flows&quot; between functions.andO;For example, if shipping does not receive timely and accurate facts aboutwhat to ship, how much and to where, meeting delivery schedules will bejeopardized.andP;  This is a critical success factor.andM;This model clarifies the business requirements, not in terms of any specificreports, but in terms of the business functions as pertinent to servicingcustomer orders.andP;  Notice, in fact, there are no specific reports, screens orforms on this model.andM;Less obvious is that these functions need to share the pertinent data.andP;  Toeffectively communicate, they must share a common understanding of what thedata means.andP;  Toward this end a common data planning model was constructed.andM;From the process model, the team found that many orders were awaiting creditapproval for extended periods of time.andP;  One way to correct this would be toincorporte in the system more explicit, quantifiable &quot;knowledge&quot; about how acustomer's financial viability is routinely verified.andP;  In this way moreorders could be accepted quickly, and credit department approval would bereduced to exceptional situations.andP;  Another solution would be to use EDI tocommunicate exceptional orders to credit and to communicate with Dun andamp;Bradstreet.andP;  The company could also set more specific objectives for how longa credit approval should take.andM;From the data side, it was found that the manufacturing plants did not sharea common identifier for common products.andP;  Salespeople always assigned ordersfrom a certain customer to a given plant, even though the same product couldbe produced at multiple plants.andP;  This, in turn, had the effect ofsingle-threading manufacturing resources, wasting capacity in some plants,while overcommitting others.andP;  A common product identifier would be adoptedacross plants.andM;On the other hand, it was found that virtually every function had alegitimate, but different, viewpoint of who the customer was.andP;  For example,to order entry the customer was the organization that placed the order.andP;  Toshipping it was the organization where the order was delivered.andM;In the case of customer XYZ Corp., the address where the bill was sent, theorder was placed and the delivery made was the same.andP;  However, for WidgetCo., orders were placed from/shipments were sent to different addresses.andP;  Thedata architecture thus reflected different roles (relationships) that thesame piece of data could legitimately play.andP;  One positive effect of this wasthat communications would improve and the occasional embarrassing and costlyshipment to the wrong address could be eliminated.andM;WHO KNOWS THE REQUIREMENTS?andM;To effectively achieve the goals of Case--integration across functional areasof the business--someone must understand the business in terms of itsinformation and cross-functional communication needs.andP;  Process modelingtools, data modeling tools and methodologies are excellent mechanisms.andP;  Butthey will prove ineffective, especially at this level, if they are notapplied to model the business--the real system.andM;A quick glance at the functional model is revealing.andP;  Each function has itsown perspective.andP;  Yet by definition, the functions of a company are there totake advantage of specialization.andP;  Further, if we look at the model, XYZCorp. is not in the business of negotiating orders, or buying products, asindependent functions.andP;  The point is, all these functions must work togetherfor the company to be effective and efficient.andM;For this to happen, the right (availability) facts must be communicatedaccurately and clearly (consistency) in the form they are needed and whenthey are needed (accessibility).andM;But none of these functions has a global understanding of the whole &quot;orderservice cycle.&quot;andP;  Thus, none is capable of planning information requirementsat this level, particularly if these requirements must be translated so thatthe &quot;fast, accurate idiot&quot; can understand them.andM;The fact is, nobody understands the information requirements at a strategiclevel.andM;Certainly, it will take the combined knowledge of all these functions toconstruct a good strategy.andP;  It must be a team effort.andP;  Yet can such a teambuild an architecture suitable for development?andM;Let's try an analogy.andP;  Antiqua is planning to build a new high school, whichwill have a gym and a theatre.andP;  Thus, the Antiqua School Board assigns thebasketball coach and the drama teacher to come up with an architecture andplan for the new facility.andP;  Ridiculous!andP;  These people are not architects.andM;PREDICTABLE RESULTSandM;Time and again, firms put together &quot;management teams&quot; to come up with astrategic information plan; they normally include a high-level MIS manager.andO;The results are all too predictable.andP;  Typically, MIS teams will take aperfunctory look at the plan, say they reviewed it and are conforming to it,and go on with what they were doing or start all over.andM;Obviously, an information architect is needed.andP;  Typically, firms do not do agood job of training their lower-level systems analysts, much less an&quot;information architect.&quot;andP;  Most firms do not have a single systems architect.andO;Companies will not be successful with Case unless they realize they will needto train and build architectural skills.andP;  Meanwhile, they will undoubtedlyhave to look outside--to high-level consultants--for these skills.andM;To get MIS under control, companies are hiring chief information officers orenlisting the help of a consultant.andP;  The &quot;right&quot; solution probably includesboth options.andM;The CIO option is necessary if business goals and the strategic directions ofthe company are to be incorporated in their information management plans.andP;  Inmodern manufacturing companies few people actually touch the product (5-10%).andO;This means the remaining 90-95% are knowledge or information workers.andO;Information management is an incredibly important (and costly) facet of themodern corporation, thus a CIO as a member of the board needs input to affectcorporate directions and values.andM;This move signals a change in the role of MIS from managers of technology tomanagers of data--real information resource management (IRM).andM;But it also signals the beginning of the final incorporation of MIS into themainstream of business.andP;  IRM is starting to take its place as a resourcemanagement &quot;function&quot; within the organization.andP;  (See Figure 2.)andM;Like other resource management functions, IRM is cross-functional.andP;  Similarto managing people or managing money, all mainline functions will beconcerned about managing information.andP;  In this environment, functionalbudgets will contain routine entries for information resource expenditures,just as they do for head counts and salaries.andM;It is also a certainty that IRM will assume corporate policy-making rolescovering such things as integration, and data sharing and capture policies.andO;Reward/consequence programs will be set up (including commission andomission) for the appropriate and inappropriate use of corporate information.andM;Functional management needs to make decisions about the application ofcomputer technology as they would to the purchase of a copying machine or adrill press.andP;  Improvements must be financially justified.andP;  Because computertechnology has become inexpensive and relatively easy to grasp, linefunctions will increasingly manage the introduction of appropriatetechnology.andP;  MIS cannot fight the trend; they are on the way out as managersof technology.andP;  No amount of &quot;mainframe bias&quot; will reverse this trend.andM;On the other hand, it is certain that, left uncontrolled (unmanaged), theplethora of local applications of technology will lead to an increasingproblem with &quot;islands of technology.&quot;andP;  Information and data captured withinthese islands may well need to be shared by other functions within thecompany.andP;  Without an approach to manage this data across functions, theorganization risks becoming functionally efficient, but organizationallyineffective.andP;  This does not spell productivity.andM;STAGES OF DP EVOLUTIONandM;Richard L. Nolan (re)presented his stage theory of data processing evolutionin the article, &quot;Managing the Crisis in Data Processing&quot; [Harvard BusinessReview, March/April 1979].andP;  (See Figure 3.)andM;Nolan's six stages of DP evolution go from &quot;initiation&quot; to &quot;maturity.&quot;andP;  Ittells the story from the &quot;inception of the computer into the organization&quot; tothe &quot;management of data resources.&quot;andP;  The Nolan stage theory, first developedby him as a four-stage theory in 1974, has proved remarkably accurate.andM;According to Nolan, the transition point occurs sometime in the controlstage, where the focus shifts from the management of technology to themanagement of data itself.andP;  &quot;This shift in orientation is a direct result ofanalyses about how to put more emphasis, in expanding DP activities, on theneeds of management control and planning as opposed to the needs ofconsolidation and coordination in the DP activities themselves,&quot; said Nolan.andM;Generally, larger organizations have already introduced computers(initiation).andP;  Most major organizations have evolved to some point from latein the control stage (stage 3) to somewhere in the integration stage (stage4).andP;  Smaller organizations are typically in earlier stages of the evolution.andO;It is doubtful that any organization, except maybe in Japan, is in stage 6.andM;Levi Strauss seems to be in early stage 5, and preparing for stage 6.andM;The organization apparently values the integration of applications, shareddata and data administration.andP;  They are trying to effect stage 6characteristics such as joint user and DP responsibility (partnerships) anddata resource strategic planning.andM;CULTURE SHOCK BAROMETERandM;Nolan's stage theory is a good barometer for talking about the &quot;cultureshock&quot; an organization will experience with Case.andM;If an organization has reached DP maturity, stage 6, there is no cultureshock.andP;  Case is simply the &quot;enabling technology.&quot;andP;  In such an organization,data (information) is considered an enterprise resource, like people ormoney.andP;  As such, everyone is naturally involved in &quot;managing&quot; this vitalresource.andM;&quot;Business systems&quot; are the thing.andP;  Computer systems are simply a tool tofacilitate the business processes of the organization.andP;  Data is recognized asthe key, shared source or supply (resource) from which information can bedeveloped from the receiver's point of view; that is, what they need, whenthey need it and in the form they need it.andM;As such, the organization strategically plans and architects this keyresource.andP;  It is taken for granted that the top person in the DP organizationis among the top executives of the organization.andM;Users routinely participate in all development projects.andP;  There is no cultureshock to these organizations.andM;Organizations that are in stage 5 realize that integration, shared data andcommon systems are needed.andP;  There is data administration.andP;  Users are probablyinvolved in the definition of key data and in reaching some consensus acrossfunctional areas about the data and the &quot;flows.&quot;andP;  JAD sessions are probablycommon.andP;  Users appreciate DP problems and realize that they are key playersin the equations.andP;  However, systems are still thought of as &quot;computersystems&quot; and data is restricted to what resides on computer databases.andM;In such an environment, integration means that computer systems and databasesfit together.andM;The examination of business processes (as the system) for effectiveness andefficiency is not clearly understood.andP;  Users do not really see this as thebusiness of DP, and do not see it as a strategic management issue.andO;&quot;Competitive advantage,&quot; so popular a term for the application of technologytoday, is restricted to &quot;Band-Aid approaches&quot; such as electroniccommunication.andM;In such an environment Case will be a front-end culture shock.andP;  The need forintegrating strategic information plans as an integral part of businessplanning will not be clearly understood or appreciated.andP;  Comprehensivebusiness requirements will be subopoptimized.andP;  Business people, particularlyexecutives, will not get involved to a serious extent.andP;  They will regardforays into this arena as diversions from their regular jobs.andP;  The fullpromises of Case will not be achieved.andM;Case will be most useful in the dsign of databases and computer systems.andO;While its application will encourage integration and will result in improvedeffectiveness and efficiencies, it will still have a technologic andbottom-up flavor.andP;  The labor intensity of designing and implementingdatabases and programs will be reduced.andP;  In short, Case will still have a lotof &quot;hare&quot; in it and not enough &quot;tortoise.&quot;andM;RETROFITTING APPLICATIONSandM;In stage 4, integration, the emphasis is on retrofitting existingapplications using DB technology.andP;  Users and their management have littleappreciation for data integration issues, other than there ought not to be somany duplicate computer files.andP;  They do appreciate online access todatabases.andP;  Steering committees are formeD, but they concentrate onprioritizing computer applications; that is, which is the most important&quot;island of technology.&quot;andM;In this tage, Case products like the reverse-engineering processes fromBachman Inforamtion Systems, Inc., Burlington, Mass., are a terrific idea.andO;Old non-DB or old DBMS applications can be efficiently, if not effectively,converted or reverse-engineered to the latest and greatest DBMS.andP;  By the way,Bachman's tools are extremely useful, even essential, in stage 5 and 6environments, because firms will always face the heady issue of how to fitnew development with existing applications and databases.andM;New projects are always constrained by what is already there.andP;  In thisenvironment, full Case implementation is a risky endeavor for MIS management,because management does not appreciate the full implications of &quot;data as aresource&quot; and instead stil gives gold stars for the delivery of localsystems, on time and within budget.andP;  The &quot;hare&quot; characteristics of Case arewhat will sell.andP;  But can expectations be managed?andM;Any organization that is in stages 1 through 3 had better think Case oververy carefully.andP;  The cultural and political risks are immense.andP;  Onlyefficiency issues will sell.andP;  But is Case really about efficiency?andM;Mach is a partner of Affiliated Business Consultants, based in Racine, Wis.,andO;and Northridge, Calif.andP;
