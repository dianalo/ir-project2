(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>This is the  first in a series  of articles on  key industry  trendsaffecting  computer hardware, software,  database environments and communications  environments.andP;  A  subsequent series of articles  willdemonstrate  how these trends  are profoundly  affecting the evolution of newcomputer architectures, development methodologies and tools.andM;Knowledge of the key industry trends  and an understanding of theirimportance are critical to the successful introduction and management ofhigh-productivity tools, technology and methodd ologies.andM;The rate of change in the computer  industry today is higher than it has been since the IBM 360 was introduced  25 years ago.andP;  Major upheavals areoccurring throughout the industry, and the roles of the traditionalmainframes and  minicomputers are diminishing.andP;  These  familiar systems arebeing replaced by  vast networks of desktop computers  and file servers.andP;  Thefuture belongs to organizations skilled in providing solutions for thedesktop-computing environment, the database infrastructure and  the networkinfrastructure.andM;Three general trends continue to characterize the development of computing hardware: faster, smaller and cheaper.andP;  Throughout the 1980s, the computing platforms used shifted from powerful mainframes to minicomputers to personalcomputers.andP;  That shift will continue as  the rate of change in computingarchitectures accelerates.andM;The figure illustrates the dramatic increases in computing power that willbecome available for mainstream computers through the 1990s.andP;  As shown, insix  years the processing power of a PC will  be equal to that of today'smainframe  computer.andM;By the end of this decade, each of  these platforms will experience anincrease of more than an order of magnitude in processing speed through anadvanced chip design that uses submicron features.andP;  As a result of the newerarchitectures, these processors will come in  more compact cabinets without aloss of  functionality.andM;In the last few years alone, the PC  has been transformed from a desktop appliance to a portable to a laptop to a  notebook and now a slate.andM;Each transformation delivered essentially the same computing power as its predecessor but in a substantially smaller case.andP;  Similar size reductions arealso  occurring in powerful workstations,  mainframes andartificial-intelligence  (AI) inference engines.andM;While the power of hardware continues to increase, the relative cost israpidly decreasing.andP;  The actual unit cost,  however, remains relativelyconstant.andP;  For example, an early PC cost about $4,000 and was equivalent toapproximately 0.3 million instructions per second (mips).andP;  Today, the cost ofa 386- based PC or Macintosh is also about  $4,000, but they're equivalent toabout 2 or 3 mips.andP;  Thus, the relative cost for  PCs over the last eightyears has declined by almost a factor of 10 -- and the  cost will continue todrop.andM;The advances in chip technology will  lead to the following improvements in desktop machines:andM;-- Much higher computing power on the  desktop;andM;-- Continuing improvement in ease of  use;andM;-- Multifunction PCs, automatic networking;andM;-- Ultra-high-speed LAN connections;andM;-- Multimedia PCs;andM;-- Real-time processing of speech input;andM;-- Megapixel, HDTV color display;andM;-- Cheap, portable PCs with cellular  communications; andandM;-- Powerful, inexpensive knowledge- based processing.andM;Much of the improvement in processing power will be gained throughparallelism.andP;  Many problems now tackled using  serial techniques areinherently parallel.andP;  These include information searches,  sorting, merging,joining, transaction processing, data collection, optimal routing, databaseprocessing, memory organization, image processing, structural simulation andCAD/CAM operations.andM;Various forms of computers will exploit parallelism.andP;  Multiple parallelprocessors will be used for transaction processing, search engines, databasemachines, knowledge-base machines, inference engines, image processors,vector processors and other parallel implementations.andM;Relative to serial machines, parallel  computers provide much greater throughput, faster response time, lower cost and  the ability to handle extremelycomplex  problems.andP;  To make use of these new techniques, we need to exploitthe inherent  parallelism in many common applications.andM;Major breakthroughs in hardware will  enable computers to head infundamentally new directions, such as ultra-parallel processing, high-speedinference engines, neural nets, programming using powerful graphical icons,AI computing  and ultra-parallel knowledge bases.andM;One result of the simultaneous increase in processing capability and declinein cost is the fading importance of  the minicomputer.andM;Minis were originally significant because they permitted the distribution of computing resources in increments  smaller than those possible in mainframes.andO;With the introduction of PCs in  the early 1980s, minis still retained an important role in a multitiered computing architecture.andP;  They were commonly used as a departmental computing platform, delivering facilities that werenot  technically feasible on the PC.andP;  But now, with the increase in local PCprocessing  and networking capabilities, the need  for minis is dissipating.andM;In the future, the current three-tier  hardware architecture of mainframes, minis and PCs will be replaced with  mainframes and networked PCs tied  intofile servers.andM;The higher performance and lower  costs of hardware will lead to specializedprocessors that can handle complex  computing environments.andP;  LISP-based coprocessors, neurocomputers and parallel- processing engines will be usedfor AI  applications.andP;  These processors will be  linked into the standardorganizational  computing environment through file  servers (again, specialprocessors) and  high-speed communications networks  (also serviced byspecialized processors).andM;One of the most profound changes in  hardware is the gradual demise of the traditional mainframe computer.andP;  Large,  central computers, such as the IBMSystem/370, have been obsolescent for years.andP;  They require numerous systems analysts to maintain complex layers of  software and their cost for mips is100  times the cost of mips on a PC.andM;Organizations are increasingly recognizing that they can cut maintenance costs, improve response time and reduce  the cost of additional mips ofprocessing power by moving applications from the  mainframe to the desktop.andM;PC BoundandM;Applications that are targets for  downsizing to networks of PCs include transaction-processing applications and  all software-development activities.andO;In a  few years, it will be inconceivable to use  expensive mainframe mipsfor software  development.andP;  All such development will  move to the PC.andM;Larger central computers will still be  needed for the sharing anddistribution  of large corporate databases, as well as  for the control ofextensive networks of  PCs and file servers.andP;  To support very  high-speedaccess to centralized data,  these large central computers will be  highlyparallel machines, consisting of  thousands of parallel processors.andP;  The mainframe will resemble a very large  file server.andM;Next week, I will describe the major  trends in computer software.andM;----------The concepts embodied in this article are described in the High-ProductivityTechnology volume in The James  Martin Report Series.andP;
