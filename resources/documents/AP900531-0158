(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The charred Apollo capsule in whichthree astronauts died 23 years ago will remain in storage inVirginia rather than be buried in an abandoned missile silo or givento a museum, NASA said Thursday.   The capsule was to have been shipped in May from Langley ResearchCenter in Hampton, Va., to its final resting place in a silo at CapeCanaveral Air Force Station. It was to have been buried on top ofdebris from the 1986 Challenger explosion, America's only otherspace tragedy.   The transfer temporarily was halted after curators at theSmithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum said theywould like to acquire the capsule as an historic artifact. TheKansas Cosmosphere and Space Center in Hutchinson, Kan., also hadexpressed interest.   NASA spokesman Mark Hess said the decision to keep the capsule atLangley indefinitely was made after conferring with relatives of thethree astronauts who died and former Apollo astronauts.   ``They just asked us to reconsider and keep it, or store it inanother way,'' Hess said.   Displaying the capsule at the Smithsonian or anywhere else wasnever seriously considered, Hess said.   ``I don't think you'd find a soul in NASA who thought that was anappropriate alternative,'' he said.   Mike Stephenson, associate director of the Kansas Cosmosphere andSpace Center, said he's pleased the capsule will not be buried inthe silo. His museum had been interested in the capsule _ and stillwould be _ for memorial purposes rather than for display.   ``It's certainly important that the artifact be preserved,''Stephenson said.   The capsule has been stored in a locked container at Langleysince the 1967 fire, which claimed the lives of astronauts Virgil``Gus'' Grissom, Roger B. Chaffee and Edward H. White II. It brieflywas removed a few weeks ago so its heat shield could be cut intopieces for shipping.   The astronauts died when fire engulfed the capsule during acountdown rehearsal for the first manned Apollo mission. The fire,in a cabin filled with 100 percent oxygen, was triggered by a sparkwhen a broken or bruised wire beneath Grissom's couch contactedmetal.   Thirty-one cartons of hardware and investigative material weremoved to Kennedy Space Center in late April for burial with thecapsule. They will be returned to Langley.</TEXT></DOC>
