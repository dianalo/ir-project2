West Sak is a loose, unconsolidated formation. As oil andwater move through it, they carry sand into the wells,plugging them. Our problem, in simplest terms, is to find aneconomical way to control that sand without blocking the flowof oil.</LP><TEXT>   We've spent many millions of dollars searching for a wayto get production under way. Eventually, we'll do it, butonly when we find an economical way to recover the crude oil.   West Sak overlies Arco's prolific Kuparuk field. In orderto cut costs and accelerate initial production, we plan toco-mingle production from the two fields through the samegathering centers and pipelines. As Kuparuk declines, WestSak will increase.   As far as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge isconcerned, we have long supported opening the area. But Idoubt that Arco's shareholders would favor delayingproduction from West Sak to try to force exploration of theRefuge, which may not occur for many years. Neither do we.   James A.
