Hiroko Seki, a spokeswoman for Japan's coast guard, said bubbleswere seen Saturday near the site of an underwater volcano severalmiles off Ito that erupted Thursday.   Nobuo Fukuda, a Central Meteorological Agency official, said moreeruptions are likely. Volcano researchers said another much strongereruption could send ash and stones over Ito.   The meteorological agency said there were more than 100 newtremors Saturday in Ito, a city of 72,000 residents 60 milessouthwest of Tokyo. Most tremors were too weak to be felt by humans.   Since June 30, more than 22,800 earthquakes, including nearly 600strong enough to be felt by people, have been recorded in the area.   Veterinarians said that over the last two weeks, they havetreated 65 dogs and cats for disorders caused by the quakes, KyodoNews Service said. It did not explain what disorders the animalssuffered.   The tremors and eruption, and the threat of more to come, havedealt a serious blow to Ito's main industry, tourism. Hoteloperators say virtually all reservations have been canceled for thenext several weeks.   At Ito Station on Saturday morning, no tourists were seenarriving on the special express trains from Tokyo, which ordinarilyare packed with a weekend exodus of city dwellers.   Officials said more than 11,000 of 12,000 visitors expected overthe weekend had canceled their hotel reservations and most of theremaining visitors were journalists covering the volcanic eruption.   All but about a dozen of the resort's 550 hotels and inns closedtheir doors because ``no one is coming,'' said a doorman at abeachside hotel.   Mitsuteru Miyazawa, the city's deputy mayor, said all publicschools would be closed at least until Wednesday as a precaution.   On Thursday, about 200 people left their seaside homes after theeruption to spend the night in Buddhist temples and schools. Butmost citizens remained in their homes on Saturday, Miyazawa said.   The Japanese archipelago, which was created by volcanic activity,is believed to have about 80 active volcanoes. In January, MountTokachi, on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, erupted severaltimes.</TEXT></DOC>
