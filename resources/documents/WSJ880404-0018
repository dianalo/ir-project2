The medical diagnostics company said a year-end audit of the Dutch unit by new auditors resulted in certain unanticipated write-downs of inventory and other adjustments.    Israel Stein, chairman, said Clinical Data expects to report a profit for fiscal 1988. &quot;We further believe that Vital has now turned the corner and will become profitable in the coming quarter,&quot; he added.    For the fiscal 1987 fourth quarter, Clinical earned $760,000, or 25 cents a share, after a one-time credit of $492,000. Revenue totaled $5.1 million. For fiscal 1987, Clinical reported net income of $1.3 million, or 43 cents a share, on revenue of $15.5 million. </TEXT></DOC>
