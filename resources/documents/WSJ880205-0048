Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE CNG </G><DATELINE> DES MOINES, Iowa  </DATELINE><TEXT>   It comes down now to the wily veteran, Rich Bond, and the untested rookie, Tom Synhorst.    Mr. Bond, running Vice President George Bush's presidential campaign here, is 37 years old. Mr. Synhorst, running Sen. Robert Dole's Iowa campaign, is 30. Questions: Can Rich Bond still throw the fast ball? Can Tom Synhorst compete in the big time?    Mr. Bush and Sen. Dole are the Republican front-runners in Iowa in a confrontation that is increasingly mean, ugly and cynical. One or the other, barring an upset for the ages, will be declared the winner late Monday when Iowa voters, Republicans and Democrats, officially open the 1988 campaign by attending 2,487 caucuses in schools and private homes on what promises to be a very cold but clear evening.    A secondary Republican battle is being fought for third place between former TV evangelist Pat Robertson and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York. The biggest game here is trying to guess the size of Mr. Robertson's charismatic, Pentecostal army. It will remain a mystery until Monday night. Also running, but not very well, are former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont and former Secretary of State Alexander Haig.    What happens Monday night is really quite simple. Having already identified its supporters, each campaign makes sure they get to the caucuses. Caucus participants sign in and then they vote for their candidate in a straw poll that has nothing to do with the process of choosing delegates. That business takes place later in the evening.    But as far as the Bush and Dole campaigns are concerned, voting in the straw poll is the end of it. &quot;We're going strictly for the straw vote,&quot; says Katie Boyle, Iowa spokesperson for the Dole campaign. &quot;The only reason these candidates have been trekking across Iowa,&quot; says Bush regional coordinator Hugh Field, lecturing his precinct leaders in Waterloo earlier this week, &quot;is the straw vote. Once that's taken, it's up to you whether you stay for the rest of the meeting.&quot;    &quot;That's not the intention of the system,&quot; says an angry Rhonda Menke, executive director of the Iowa Republican Party. &quot;The straw poll is just the fun part. The serious business is choosing the delegates and building the party by staying for the whole meeting. But I guess they don't care about our 37 lousy delegates.&quot;    They -- the Dole and Bush campaigns -- care about one thing: those straw-poll numbers that will be flashed around the nation Monday night.    One live body equals one straw vote.    That's the job faced by the veteran Mr. Bond and the rookie Mr. Synhorst. Get those bodies to the caucuses. Get more of them than the other camp. Because if you win here, you get a big jump in the polls for the second event -- the New Hampshire primary, eight days later. If you win that, you get a big jump for the 20 contests on Super Tuesday, three weeks after New Hampshire.    Mr. Bond was here eight years ago, a rookie then himself. Showing a good fast ball, he put together the organization that gave George Bush his surprising victory over Ronald Reagan.    That same organization has remained in place ever since. &quot;Bush Brigade&quot; units hold annual meetings. They have their own newsletter. It has become a kind of private club, which Dole supporters say is basically elitist.    Mr. Synhorst has never worked in a presidential campaign before, but he was the successful political director in Sen. Charles Grassley's re-election campaign in 1986.    &quot;People say Bob Dole needs a 10-point lead in the polls to win the caucuses,&quot; says one insider here. &quot;They figure Bob Dole is so disorganized he couldn't put together a two-car motorcade.&quot; But Mr. Dole isn't running the organization here. Young Tom Synhorst is, and some people think the organization he has put together is younger, fresher and more enthusiastic than Mr. Bush's.    The battle for third place, in its own way, is significant, too. For Mr. Robertson, next Monday will test whether his &quot;silent army&quot; of supporters is a reality or a pipe dream. Strategists for Rep. Kemp believe that a respectable third here is necessary to provide momentum for New Hampshire, where they believe Mr. Kemp is positioned to overcome the front-runners. Mr. Kemp got a boost yesterday when 102 evangelical ministers announced their support for him.    What's happening to the Republicans in Iowa isn't a pretty sight. A lot of anger is building up here that is uncharacteristic of most Republican campaigns. Key supporters of Mr. Dole don't like their opposite numbers in the Bush camp. Some of the Bush people look down on the Dole people as upstarts.    A particularly nasty episode occurred earlier this week when George Wittgraf, Mr. Bush's Iowa chairman, put out a news release attacking Sen. Dole's &quot;record of cronyism and his history of mean-spiritedness.&quot; Mr. Dole's &quot;mean-spiritedness,&quot; Mr. Wittgraf said, &quot;nearly single-handedly brought the Republican national ticket down to defeat&quot; in 1976, when Mr. Dole was President Ford's running mate.    Sen. Dole demanded that the vice president fire Mr. Wittgraf. He didn't.    The Wittgraf attack was an attempt to capitalize on recent disclosures regarding possible legal violations by past associates of Sen. Dole in the award of an Army contract in 1986. The senator reportedly called the Small Business Administration in 1983 on behalf of the contractor, a former Dole aide and minority businessman in Kansas. But House Small Business Committee Chairman John LaFalce (D., N.Y.) said yesterday the phone call doesn't suggest the senator was himself involved in questionable activities.    The dispute spilled onto the Senate floor yesterday as Mr. Dole animatedly confronted Mr. Bush with Mr. Wittgraf's news release. &quot;I wanted the vice president to tell me man to man that he had authorized it,&quot; Sen. Dole said later. &quot;He said he had authorized it but hadn't read it -- so I handed him a copy.&quot; Messrs. Dole and Bush were in the Senate for the vote on President Reagan's Contra aid request.    By most accounts, Sen. Dole holds a narrow lead over the vice president. But there are so many imponderables -- the weather, the mysterious, evangelical army of Pat Robertson, the skills of rookie Tom Synhorst, the staying power of Rich Bond and his aging Bush brigades.
