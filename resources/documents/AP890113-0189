Israeli soldiers reportedly killed twoPalestinians and wounded 18 in separate clashes.   In Jerusalem, assailants believed to be Jewish militants smasheda monument to fallen Arab soldiers.   Israeli soldiers killed a 15-year-old Palestinian during a clashat the Dheishe refugee camp near Bethlehem, doctors said. They saida bullet hit Nabil Mohammed Abu Laban in the shoulder and thenpierced his heart.   An Arab reporter said the youth was shot when dozens of Arabyouths hurled stones at troops, who responded with tear gas, rubberbullets and, finally, live ammunition. He died at a Bethlehemhospital.   The army said it was checking the report. Israel radio confirmedthe death and said another youth was wounded in the clash.   Earlier Friday, a 15-year-old Arab died of wounds sustained in aclash with Israeli troops a day before, officials at MukassedHospital in east Jerusalem said.   They said Mohammed Yaqub Shalhoub was shot in the head during aconfrontation in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the occupied GazaStrip.   An army spokesman confirmed the death and said the boy was shotwhen troops who pursued stone-throwers found themselves in adangerous situation. The spokesman, who cannot be identified undermilitary rules, did not elaborate.   The deaths raised to at least 353 the number of Palestinianskilled since the uprising against Israeli rule was launched in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in December 1987. Fifteen Israelishave been killed.   Armed Jewish settlers patrolled the streets of Hebron, claimingthey wanted to prevent stone-throwing attacks on their cars, Israelradio said.   Arab youths hurled rocks at the patrol, and the settlers openedfire in the air, the radio and Arab reports said. The action sparkeda riot by Arabs in the city's casbah, a maze of narrow streetsserving as an open-air market, they said.   An Arab reporter in the city said dozens of youths who left themain Ibrahim Mosque began throwing stones at soldiers, who openedfire with live ammunition, wounding a 20-year-old in the stomach anda 22-year-old in the leg.   The army spokesman confirmed the injuries but said he was unawareof the settlers' patrol.   In east Jerusalem, assailants partially smashed a stone monumentto soldiers of the Arab Legion near the Rockefeller Museum, policespokesman Alex Lapidot said. He said police had no suspects.   The Arab Legion was the Jordanian force that tried to prevent theestablishment of Israel in 1948.   An anonymous caller told Israel Army radio the monument wasdamaged by ``lovers of the land of Israel and the Jewish people.''   He said the attack was to protest the dismantling by troops twodays ago of a monument erected by Jewish settlers in honor of anIsraeli taxi driver slain in the West Bank. Settlers have vowed toerect additional monuments to Jews killed in the occupied lands indefiance of an army ban.   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek condemned the desecration of themonument.   ``Several idiots came from some place in the West Bank to damagethe monument,'' Kollek said. ``This is stupidity and idiocy inaddition to evil.''   Kollek expressed concern the incident may spark retaliation byArab militants and further fuel tensions in the disputed city. Hesaid the municipality will offer money to Arab authorities forrepairing the monument.   New confrontations were reported in the Gaza Strip. Hospitalofficials said at least seven Palestinian were wounded in clashes atthe Jabalya and Shati refugee camps.   In the Khan Yunis refugee camp, soldiers shot and wounded threeyoung Palestinians, officials at Nasser Hospital said. The woundedincluded an 11-year-old boy shot in the pelvis and a 12-year-oldwounded in the leg, they said.   Merchants in Gaza began a commercial strike after pro-PLO leadersof the uprising called for the move in slogans painted on walls.   The strike is to protest Israeli raids to collect taxes fromPalestinians. Non-payment of taxes is a major tactic of the uprising.   In the West Bank, a 17-year-old Palestinian from the village ofFaroun was hit by a plastic bullet in the leg when soldiers openedfire at masked stone throwers, doctors said. Four others werewounded at the Askar refugee camp.</TEXT></DOC>
