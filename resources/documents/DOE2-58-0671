MRequipments used for this study were 0.15, 0.2 Tesla resistive magneticresonance imager and 0.5 Tesla super conducting magnetic resonance imager.In the detectability of peripheral masses, small nodules could be moreeasily indentified by CT rather than by MRI. The minimal size of nodulesindentified by MRI was more than 5 - 7 mm in diameter. In addition, thegreater spatial resolution of CT made it possible to detect nodules vicinityto the diaphragm or the pleura. Regarding the diagnosis of inner structureof tumors, MRI was almost equivalent to CT in detection of a cavity inthe tumor, but CT was superior to MRI for detecting necrosis in the tumor.When the tumor was accompanied obstructive pneumonia or collapse, tumorextent could be demarcated in 25 % of these cases studied by CT and in44 % by MRI. As for the diagnosis of tumor invasion to the chest wall,MRI was equivalent to CT. However, coronal and sagittal MRI were veryhelpful for demonstrating tumor invasion, especially in the apex of thelung. Besides, MRI gave an advantage over CT in the ability to distinguishthe tumor invasion into fatty tissues or muscular ones. In conclusion,MRI is near or less equivalent to CT in the diagnosis of pulmonary nodulesnow, but it is expected to offer more useful clinical information thanthat of CT in the diagnosis of pulmonary nodules, because of the reasonthat was mentioned above.</TEXT></DOC>
