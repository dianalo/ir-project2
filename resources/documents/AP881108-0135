It was a test of George Bush's coattails, since the Republicanvice president was confident of claiming Florida's 21 electoralvotes in his presidential race against Democrat Michael Dukakis.   MacKay called himself the logical successor to the retiring Sen.Lawton Chiles, a three-term Democrat. Mack's late-campaign strategywas based on Bush's large lead in the Florida opinion polls, and onPresident Reagan's popularity here.   Floridians also voted on a proposition to make English theofficial state language, a measure controversial in a state with alarge Hispanic population.</TEXT><TEXT>   Mack, 48, a former Cape Coral bank president, and MacKay, 55, anOcala lawyer, both were elected to the U.S. House in 1982. Theyoffered different philosophies and styles.   Mack's campaign commercials often had the tag line: ``Hey Buddy,You're Liberal,'' and President Reagan did a five-minute satellitefeed for Mack on Monday that charged MacKay had a record that was``liberal, liberal, liberal.''   MacKay blasted Mack as an ideologue with a far-right agenda thatwas ``anti-Florida.'' He cited his endorsements from seniorcitizens' groups, children's advocates, women's groups, teachers,the state Fraternal Order of Police, and 27 of 30 Florida dailynewspapers that made recommendations.   MacKay jumped into the Senate race after longtime ally ReubinAskew, former two-term governor, dropped out. The ensuing six-wayDemocratic race led to a runoff in which MacKay defeated 1980 Senatenominee Bill Gunter.   Mack had gotten into what appeared to be a longshot race againstChiles in October 1987. He is the namesake of a grandfather who wasthe beloved owner and manager of the Philadelphia Athletics baseballteam.</TEXT></DOC>
