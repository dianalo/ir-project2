They are forming a 3,000-member rapiddeployment force across the border to go to the aid of the Kurds ifnecessary.;    &quot;We're just a phone call away,&quot; Garner said.;    Garner stoodat attention as the U.S. flag was lowered over the former Iraqi army compoundthat had been allied headquarters near this border town.;    Nearby, a groupof U.S. military police marked their imminent departure by listening to a GunsN' Roses rendition of Bob Dylan's &quot;Knocking on Heaven's Door.&quot;;    &quot;It's abittersweet feeling, really,&quot; U.S. Col. Jim Jones, commander of the 24thMarine Expeditionary Unit, said just before leaving. &quot;We're all happy to begoing home. But we're saying goodbye to a lot of people we worked with and hada lot of compassion for.&quot;;    At its peak, Operation Provide Comfort involved21,701 troops from several nations -- more than 13,000 of them in Iraq. Thelast allied troops in northern Iraq pulled out by truck, plane and helicopter,with the final soldiers leaving in an overland convoy.;    Fred Cuny, adisaster assistance consultant working for the U.S. State Department, said theallies also were transporting 44 people from the security zone forresettlement in the United States. These included people who needed medicaltreatment and interpreters who had helped the allies.;    &quot;And there are acouple of other cases who were at high risk because of their activitiesagainst the government,&quot; he said. Britain and France also would be taking anunspecified number of people, he added.;    Allied aircraft will continue tofly over northern Iraq, and the coalition has forbidden Iraq from usingairplanes and helicopters north of the 36th parallel, a considerably largerarea than the security zone.;    However, Baghdad will be allowed to send asmall contingent of police to the border with Turkey &quot;to perform a customsfunction,&quot; said Garner, commander of allied troops in northern Iraq.;    SomeKurds said they would not allow such an arrangement.;    Sunday, Kurdishleader Jalal Talabani was quoted as saying that a new agreement with the Iraqigovernment on Kurdish autonomy is nearly complete. Kurdish leaders reportedlywere anxious to conclude an autonomy agreement before the allied withdrawal.;   Local Kurdish guerrilla leaders met in Zakho on Sunday to make plans fortaking over security in the region, and guerrillas joined U.S. paratroopers ata checkpoint near the border Sunday afternoon.;    Shafik Saadullah, localleader of the Kurdistan Front -- an umbrella for eight major Kurdish guerrillagroups -- said Sunday that 200 to 300 of the front's guerrillas already wereauthorized to carry weapons in Zakho and that this figure will grow. He didnot say by how much.;    &quot;The most important problem we are expecting is thatthe government will try to enter the area so as to fill the vacuum left by thecoalition forces,&quot; Saadullah said.;    About 4,000 Kurds blocked a bridgeSaturday leading to Turkey, pleading for the allies to stay. Sunday, 200 to300 Kurds carried banners making the same plea, but they said their gatheringwas one of gratitude, not protest.;    Garner told the demonstrators that heand other soldiers were proud to have helped them. Then he donned atraditional Kurdish headdress and posed with Kurdish guerrillas on the hood ofa U.S. military truck.;    The crowd cheered.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Zakho, Iraq  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910715  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  695  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday July 15, 199100197179,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
