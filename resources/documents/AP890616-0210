(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Du Pont Co. has developed a new versionof its familiar Teflon frypan coating for computers, fiber opticsand other high technology uses.   Teflon AF is a descendent of the non-stick substance that wasdiscovered 51 years ago, specialty business director David C.Sanders said Thursday.   The AF stands for amorphous fluoropolymers, the chemical compoundthat is credited with making the new product an improvement over thestuff that is best known for keeping food from sticking to pots andpans.   ``This product is a quantum leap forward in polymer technology.It is designed specifically for advanced, high technologyapplications and can be tailored for many high performance uses,''said Thomas R. Darling, Du Pont venture manager for Teflon AF.   With performance characteristics that far exceed ordinary Teflon,the new product is expected to meet design engineers' material needsin a variety of high technology areas, including high-speed computercircuitry, the company said in a statement.   Du Pont has targeted several markets for the new product,including aerospace, automotive, aircraft, biomedical, specializedchemical handling and possible petroleum exploration, Darling said.   ``We view this as a complimentary addition to the Teflon productline. It's not likely it will compete with markets Teflon nowserves. It will open up new markets for this particular type ofTeflon and it tends to be in areas of fairly high technology,''Darling said.   He said the new Teflon is soluble, unlike the original, solidversion. It has electrical properties that are expected to be idealfor high-speed advanced generation computers and other hightechnology needs of the 21st century.   The company said the new product can also function in severetemperatures and can be used in such chemical applications assemiconductor processing.   Darling said more uses for the new product are sure to bediscovered over the years.   ``I do expect this will have a long and healthy life. It hasperformance features new to the Teflon current family and over thelong term we will continue to find uses for it as they have'' forthe older version, Darling said. ``Du Pont technology can helpcustomize and tailor the material to meet specific, and as yetunknown, needs.''   The company has built a Teflon AF plant in Fayetteville, N.C.,which is expected to begin operations at the end of July or in earlyAugust, Darling said.   The original Teflon was discovered accidentally April 6, 1938, bya young chemist named Roy J. Plunkett.   In addition to cookware, it coats chemical tanks, jogging suitsand lightbulbs.   Its greatest commercial use is in wire coating, followed bygaskets and shaft seals and pipe and tank coatings.</TEXT></DOC>
