This is postulated to be an intermediate step in the DNA nickingand closing catalytic activity. An essential tyrosine residue in theactive site acting as a nulceophile is thus implied. Chemical modificationof the tyrosine residues in M. luteus DNA topoisomerase I and DNA gyrasewith tetranitromethane leads to enzyme inactivation. Here the authorsinvestigate if DNA topoisomerases can be phosphorylated in vitro by tyrosinespecific viral pp60/sup src/ and normal cellular TPK 75 protein kinasepurified from rat liver and the effect of the phosphorylation on thetopoisomerase activity.</TEXT></DOC>
