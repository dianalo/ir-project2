MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As a campaign slogan, sequestration is notgoing to make it. Too long, almost a tongue-twister, it is foursyllables of bureaucratic jargon. Besides, as one Democratobserved, most voters probably think it is an Olympic event havingsomething to do with horses.   No such luck.   What it is is the government code for automatic spending cuts,jargon masking the fact that Congress and the White House haven'tmanaged to put together a budget that fits their own deficit rules.   President Bush has delivered a simple, Republican translationthat is likely to be built into the GOP campaign of 1990:``Congress is to blame.''   Bush has the better pulpit, but the Democrats aren't about toplead guilty. So the budget feud will become a theme of the contestfor House and Senate seats next year, by which time the mess may beworse than it is now.   The sequester system of spending reductions has been in effectfor just short of a month, triggered by budget failure. Bush isthreatening to leave it in place, unless Congress devises anddelivers spending cuts of about $14 billion.   ``Sequestration is a drastic action, but neither theadministration nor the Congress must flinch from our obligation tokeep this nation's deficit moving down and ultimately to reduce thedebt,'' Bush said in self-appraisal of his presidency so far. Butthey've already flinched _ the deficit hasn't been moving down.   The sequester system of spending reductions is part of a processof deadlines and ceilings that are supposed to rein in deficitspending and start trimming it. The automatic cuts that now are ineffect, and become more drastic if they stay, are to reducespending by an estimated $16.1 billion, although the final figuremay turn out to be somewhat lower.   Bush now says that unless Congress can slice the deficit by atleast $14 billion in a bill that still is being negotiated, he'llveto the bill and leave the automatic cuts in place. ``We areprepared to manage the government under sequester,'' he said.   The president said the bill will have to produce real reductionsin red ink without new taxes, without pushing off spending in afashion that will push the deficit up in future budgets, andwithout gimmicks.   He didn't define gimmicks, perhaps because the originaladministration plan for deficit reduction included savings to berealized by pushing up the date of a $3 billion military payroll,and dropping postal costs from the budget numbers.   But there also is an advantage for the administration in keepingthe current cuts _ Bush must send Congress a new federal budget,for the year beginning Oct. 1, 1990, only two months from now. Withthe automatic cuts in place at least into the winter months, itwill be easier to produce a budget meeting next year's deficitceiling, $74 billion.   That also would strengthen his hand in opposing future taxincreases.   Bush said he still wants to work with the Democrats in Congressfor a bipartisan budget settlement that will bring down thedeficits, and that politics can wait until the fall of 1990.   But budget pronouncements on both sides are taking on apolitical edge. ``The American people know why this deficit isn'tdown,'' Bush said last Tuesday. ``They see, 4 to 1, that theCongress is to blame.''   It's not a new argument.   When he signed a 1981 debt ceiling bill that pushed the limitpast $1 trillion, Ronald Reagan said the measure ``can stand as amonument to the policies of the past which brought it about,policies which as of today are reversed.''   The government has had to triple the limit since then. Lastweek, just before a default deadline, Congress passed and Bushsigned a bill increasing the debt limit to $3.12 trillion.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
