In a study published in Science magazine, two chemistsfrom the University of California at San Diego reported thatnitrous oxide produced as a byproduct in nylon manufacturingmay account for as much as 10% of the annual increase of thegas in the atmosphere. &quot;It's the first example of anindustrial source of nitrous oxides,&quot; said William Trogler, aco-author of the report with Mark Thiemens. &quot;Previously allthe sources were considered to be natural processes.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Until now, much attention has been focused on the coolantchlorofluorocarbons. CFCs are suspected of damaging the ozonelayer, which protects the earth from the sun's harmfulultraviolet rays. Under international treaties, chemicalcompanies are phasing out the production of CFCs.   The possibility of global warming has been blamed on sharpincreases in the amount of carbon dioxide and methane in theatmosphere. These gases are believed to trap solar heat andthereby raise the earth's average temperature.   The report on nitrous oxide is likely to bring newenvironmental attention to the large number of chemicalcompanies that produce nylon. The study said nylon plantsworld-wide release an estimated 1.5 billion pounds of nitrousoxide a year.   The amount of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere seemsextremely small, about 300 parts per billion. This isincreasing in the Northern Hemisphere at the rate of 0.9parts per billion a year. &quot;Because of its atmosphericlifetime of approximately 150 years, identification of allsignificant sources is particularly important,&quot; the authorssaid.   According to the study, about 30% of nitrous oxide sourceshaven't been identified. The major sources are algae andbacterial activity in nature. It's disputed whether theburning of fossil fuel and degradation of fertilizer alsoproduce the gases.   In nylon manufacturing, the synthesis of adepic acid,which is one of the two compounds needed to make nylon,generates nitrous oxide, also known as &quot;laughing gas,&quot; onceused as an anesthetic. Mr. Trogler said that while the gascontributes to global warming, its effect on ozone depletionis a more important threat.   He said nitrous oxide acts as a catalyst. One singlemolecule of it destroys many molecules of ozone and &quot;it keepson doing this over and over again until some chemicalreaction stops it,&quot; he said.   Du Pont Co., a major manufacturer of nylon, acknowledgedthat nitrous oxide in nylon manufacturing destroys ozone. ButRoss Stevens, manager of environmental affairs at thecompany, disagreed that it's contributing to increases in thelevel of the gas in the atmosphere. He said most of the gasin Du Pont plants is destroyed before it reaches theatmosphere. James Bashkin, a researcher at Monsanto Co., saidthe company doesn't release the nitrous oxide from itsmanufacturing plants because it treats it in a specialfurnace.</TEXT></DOC>
