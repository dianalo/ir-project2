The species isthreatened with eradication of insular breeding populations by introducedfoxes. Recovery efforts over the past 14 years has yielded an increasefrom 790 birds in 1975 to about 5,800 birds in fall 1988. Annual increasesin numbers of Aleutian Canada geese on the California wintering groundshave averaged 16 percent. While fox control in Alaska made former breedingislands once again suitable for nesting geese, Canada goose closure areasin key California and Oregon wintering habitat have been primarily responsiblein allowing the Aleutian Canada goose population to dramatically increasein size. Since publication of the proposed rulemaking, some parties have requestedan extension of the comment period to allow further public input. The Servicefinds that extending the public comment period will benefit the rulemakingprocess and, hence, issues this notice. Written comments may be submitteduntil January 29, 1990, to the Service offices in the <T4>ADDRESSES</T4> section.Authority for this action is the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C.1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">Author </ITAG>The primary author of this notice is Ronald L.
