The engines from the British Midland Boeing 737-400 that crashedSunday were removed from an embankment along a freeway near the townof Kegworth and taken to nearby East Midlands Airport.   The plane, bound for Belfast, Northern Ireland, crashed whiletrying an emergency landing at the airport, killing 44 people andinjuring 82.   Investigators are trying to determine why the plane's apparentlyworking right engine was turned off during the flight when laterexamination showed it was the left engine that caught fire.Speculations have focused on a faulty engine warning system and crewerror.   Most of the wreckage will be reassembled at the Royal AircraftEstablishment at Farnborough, said Ed Trimble, a senior inspectorfrom the Department of Transport Air Accidents Investigation Branch.   The engines, however, will be taken to Paris for detailedinspection by the manufacturer following a preliminary inspection atEast Midlands Airport, he said.   ``We must await a full strip inspection of both engines. That'smost important,'' Trimble said.   On Wednesday, the Civil Aviation Authority ordered Britishairlines using Boeing 737s and Airbus A320s equipped with theU.S.-French CFM56 engine to inspect the fire and vibration warningsystems for ``left-right sense.''   Those checks were completed Thursday by six airlines, and nonefound any problems. The aviation authority also ordered morefrequent inspections of the engines built by CFM, a joint venture ofSNECMA of France and General Electric of the United States.   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration also has ordered checksof the warning systems of 300 Boeing 737s operated by U.S. carriers.Unlike the British agency, however, the FAA did not order morefrequent engine inspections.   Fred Farrar, a spokesman for the FAA in Washington, said therehad been ``very, very isolated incidents'' of cross-wiring ofwarning systems in U.S. aircraft. But he said none had led to anaccident.   The Air Accidents Investigation Branch said Wednesday it obtainedevidence early in the investigation that both engines ``might havesuffered a related failure.''   The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said there havebeen two crashes involving double failures of CFM56 engines. In bothcases, foul weather was a contributing factor, but that was not anelement in the British Midland disaster.   The Times of London reported Thursday that investigators believedthe disaster began shortly after takeoff from Heathrow Airport withthe failure of the No. 3 bearing in the left engine, which createdvibration and intense heat.   As the captain throttled back on the damaged engine to preparefor an emergency landing, The Times said the vibration would haveceased, and _ if the right engine had been shut down _ could havedisguised the fact that the wrong engine had been turned off.   The Times said investigators believe that the No. 3 bearing, justbehind the engine's high-pressure compressor, broke down completelyas the aircraft made its final approach, leaving the 737 withoutpower.   The newspaper said investigators believe that faulty wiring ledto a false warning that the right engine, not the left, was on fire.However, it said the plugs that attach the warning circuits tocockpit levers are designed to prevent right and left from beingaccidentally swapped, and there was no indication how a falsewarning could have been given.   A Tranport Department spokesman refused to comment on thenewspaper's report.   The first funerals for crash victims were held Thursday inBelfast. Denis Maloney, 65, and his wife Pearl, 59, ``were alwaystogether in life, and their bodies were found together in death.They died in each other's arms,'' the Rev. Aidan Kerr said at aRequiem Mass at St. Brigid's Roman Catholic Church.</TEXT></DOC>
