Rehnquist, in the court's main opinion, said the Indiana lawprotects &quot;societal order and morality&quot; in a constitutionally permissible way.;   &quot;Public indecency statutes such as the one before us reflect moraldisapproval of people appearing in the nude among strangers in public places,&quot;Rehnquist said.;    But he said erotic performances will be allowed so long asdancers wear G-strings and pasties.;    Justices Sandra Day O'Connor andAnthony M. Kennedy joined Rehnquist's opinion. Justices Antonin Scalia andDavid H. Souter, in separate opinions, agreed that states may ban suchdancing.;    Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun andJohn Paul Stevens dissented.;    The court in 1981 said nude dancing &quot;is notwithout its First Amendment protections from official regulations.&quot; But the1981 ruling did not specify the precise scope of those protections.;    Today,the court again ruled that nude dancing does have some constitutionalprotection, but added that states may regulate or ban it.;    The decision didnot say whether a state could attempt to outlaw a nude ballet, or nude scenesin an opera. But Rehnquist's opinion repeatedly referred to the conduct beingbanned as &quot;go-go&quot; and &quot;barroom style&quot; dancing.;    The Indiana law waschallenged by two South Bend businesses -- a bar and an adult bookstore thatfeatures live dancers -- and three women who said they wanted to dance withouthaving to wear &quot;pasties&quot; and &quot;G-strings.&quot;;    Lawyers for JR's Kitty KatLounge, the Chippewa Bookstore and dancers Gayle Sutro, Carla Johnson andDarlene Miller lost before a federal trial judge but won in the Chicago-based7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.;    The appeals court, by a 7-4 vote, saidnude dancing is &quot;inherently expressive&quot; and as such is constitutionallyprotected.;    Today, the high court said the appeals court was wrong.;    Thedecision relied heavily on a 1968 ruling in which the court upheld a criminalconviction for burning a draft card. In that ruling, the court said governmentofficials do not violate First Amendment rights when they regulate the&quot;non-speech&quot; element of conduct that is combined with some &quot;speech&quot; element.;   More recently, in decisions that struck down bans on burning the U.S. flag,the court has said that conduct receives constitutional protection if there isa conscious intent to convey a message and if it is likely the message will beunderstood by those who witness the conduct.;    The court in past rulings hasallowed governmental regulation if it &quot;furthers an important or substantialinterest . . . unrelated to the suppression of free expression, and if theincidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedom is no greater thanis essential to the furtherance of that interest.&quot;;    Today, the court saidthe Indiana ban on nude dancing was not an attempt to censor &quot;the eroticmessage conveyed by the dancers.&quot;;    Writing for the four dissenters, Whitesaid the court was misapplying its 1968 decision in the draft card-burningcase and misreading other past rulings on freedom of expression.;    &quot;That theperformance in the Kitty Kat Lounge may not be high art, to say the least, andmay not appeal to the court, it is hardly an excuse for distorting andignoring settled doctrine,&quot; White said.;    States already had the power underthe 21st Amendment to regulate performances, including the power to ban nudedancing, in establishments that serve alcoholic drinks.;    Indiana'spublic-indeceny law was broader than that because it banned nudity in placessuch as adult bookstores, where no alcoholic beverages are served.;    Otherstates where similarly broad bans on nude dancing have been upheld by statecourts are Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Nebraska andTennessee.;    The case was closely watched. Indiana's appeal from the 7thCircuit court's ruling had been supported in briefs submitted by, amongothers, five states -- Arizona, Connecticut, Missouri, North Carolina andPennsylvania -- the National League of Cities, the National Governors'Association, the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the American FamilyAssociation, previously the National Federation for Decency.;    Lawyers forthe governors and mayors groups said such public-indecency laws are enacted&quot;to maintain a decent society, preserve society's moral structure, and preventthe detrimental consequences that flow from the crass commercial exploitationof sex.&quot;;    The case is Barnes vs. Glen Theatre, 90-26.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910621  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  771  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday June 21, 199100173236,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
