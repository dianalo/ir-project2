Broadbent, deputy assistant Treasury secretary for informationsystems, last month urged GSA's IRM Service to increase agency buying powerand let project managers make more procurement decisions.andP;  He has beenvoicing similar recommendations for the past several months.andM;But recently Broadbent's comments landed him in some hot water on CapitolHill.andP;  Sen.andP;  John Glenn (D-Ohio), chairman of the Senate Governmental AffairsCommittee, chastised Broadbent and questioned Treasury's motives in seekingprocurement process reforms.andM;Though Broadbent has said his public statements have been nothing more thansuggestions, they touched off a series of letters between Glenn and TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady.andP;  Senate staff members have said Glenn is notsatisfied with Brady's explanations about Combs' and Broadbent's remarks,especially a meeting with top Office of Management and Budget officials.andM;Broadbent last month said he expected Austin to announce the committee'smembers within a few weeks.andP;  He said Treasury would play a role but said GSAwould have to answer all other questions about the effort.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
