The committee will meet today to consider the tax changes, along with so-called technical corrections to the 1986 tax bill.    A senior committee aide said that half the $2 billion tax boost for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 would come from measures to speed up the payment of corporate estimated taxes, to restrict certain cash withdrawals from life-insurance policies, and to cut back a system that allows Alaskan native corporations to sell their tax &quot;losses&quot; to U.S. corporations.    The remaining $1 billion to be proposed by Chairman Rostenkowski will come from a list of potential revenue-raisers the Illinois Democrat circulated last week. The most likely candidate is a proposal to raise almost $600 million in fiscal 1989 by ending an accounting procedure used by some businesses with long-term contracts to defer taxes. That measure, however, could run into opposition in the Senate Finance Committee, which will take up the tax bill after House action is completed.    Committee aides said the chairman's proposal won't include two revenue-raising items that have concerned the financial markets in recent days: an increase in taxes for debt-financed mergers and acquisitions, and a 5% withholding tax on interest paid to foreigners. Both proposals were on the list the chairman circulated last week, but neither is likely to be adopted by the committee.    In addition to the extension of the research and development credit, the $2 billion tax increase would be used to pay for extending the tax break for employer-provided educational assistance and several other expiring tax provisions.    The package, which would raise $6 billion over three years, would also give farmers and boat operators relief from new collection procedures for the diesel-fuel excise tax enacted last year. Under the 1987 law, businesses that don't use highways must nevertheless pay the highway excise tax when they purchase diesel fuel, and then apply for a refund. The change would allow off-highway fuel buyers to escape the tax altogether, as they did previously.    Treasury officials are also hoping Chairman Rostenkowski will include an increase in the Treasury's authority to sell long-term bonds in the bill. But there is little chance of that change being enacted before the Treasury's quarterly debt refinancing in August.    Some Ways and Means members are disturbed that Mr. Rostenkowski isn't planning to include any narrowly focused special-interest &quot;transition rules&quot; or other money-losing tax changes favored by the committee members. But he is determined to keep such pork-barrel provisions to a minimum. He wants to hold the tax-increase provisions to $2 billion, committee aides say, because that's roughly the same amount of new taxes proposed in President Reagan's budget.    &quot;The committee members are going to see a very lean package from the chairman,&quot; a senior committee aide said. The idea is that if members wish to include additional special favors for their constituents, they will have to find ways to pay for them.    Both Rep. Rostenkowski and Senate Finance Committee Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) hope to complete work on the tax bill this year. But given the abbreviated election-year congressional session, that may prove difficult. </TEXT></DOC>
