Genentech Inc., of South San Francisco, Calif., will market the drug under the brand name Activase.    Studies show that TPA, tissue plasminogen activator, is effective at dissolving clots that block oxygen-rich blood from getting to the heart, if used within a few hours of a heart attack. More than 70% of the clots in patients injected with TPA were dissolved when the product was administered within six hours.    TPA is produced in the body, but in very small amounts. Before recent advances in biotechnology, there was no way to genetically copy the natural protein and produce enough of it to meet the needs of heart attack patients.    Doctors say the drug should be used with caution in pregnant women, people over 75 and anytime bleeding is a significant problem.    For weeks, securities analysts and industry observers have noted almost daily the increasing rumors of imminent FDA action, which seemed vindicated when FDA Commissioner Frank Young told the drug trade press he expected an announcment in &quot;days to weeks.&quot;    The biotechnology company has maintained strict official silence on the fate of the clot-dissolving drug since an FDA advisory panel recommended against its approval in May, demanding more data on the drug's safety and its effects on heart function and patient survival.    Buoyed by the expectation of good news, however, Genentech stock yesterday rose $3.25 to close at $42.75 a share, capping a two-week period in which the stock advanced 47% in national over-the-counter trading.    Since its May setback, the company has submitted two studies, one Australian and one American, in an effort to satisfy the agency that the drug not only dissolves clots, but is safe, improves overall heart pumping action and extends patients' lives. Those pivotal but unpublished studies are scheduled to be presented next week at a meeting of the American Heart Association in Anaheim, Calif.    The FDA announcement will follow by one week its approval of intravenous streptokinase, a clot-dissolving drug that has been in use for a decade but only by delicate injection into the heart. Streptokinase, marketed in the U.S. by Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals Inc. and by SmithKline Beckman Corp., is priced at about $200 a treatment. Although Genentech hasn't set its U.S. price for TPA, the drug has sold for more than $2,000 a treatment in West Germany, and U.S. analysts expect it will cost about the same here.    Though some analysts question whether doctors will support a price that is ten times greater than competitor drugs, TPA has won passionate fans. William Ganz, a cardiologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, contends, &quot;TPA is a very effective drug, probably significantly more effective than streptokinase.&quot; Dr. Ganz, who has been administering TPA as part of the continuing research group, said, &quot;Referring cardiologists are asking for it.&quot;    Genentech has used the five months since the FDA's initial rebuff of TPA &quot;to build inventory and hone our marketing,&quot; the company's chief executive officer, Robert Swanson, told a group of securities analysts recently.    After a post-rejection pause in TPA's production, the company is believed to have resumed its manufacture of the drug at its South San Francisco factory in recent weeks. Genentech also is prepared to double its 75-person sales force when the FDA gives TPA its blessing.    Mr. Swanson estimated TPA shipments could begin within three weeks after approval. </TEXT></DOC>
