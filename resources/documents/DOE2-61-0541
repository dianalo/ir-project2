In order to attain this or otherobjects, there is provided a self-evaporating burner having a cylindricalcombustion space with openings in its wall for the admission of combustionair and with an inlet in its floor for the liquid fuel. There is a firstcage placed concentrically in the combustion space with a small diametersurrounded by a second cage with a larger diameter as a circular outletfor the gases produced by combustion. The first cage is shut off at thetop by an upper cover wall, whereas the second outer cage is shut offat the top by an annular outer part of the cover wall at a lower levelthan the first part thereof. The space inside the second cage is dividedinto two annular spaces by a perforated ring. The floor forming the bottomof the combustion space is covered over by a screen to prevent it beingcooled by incoming air for combustion. 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
