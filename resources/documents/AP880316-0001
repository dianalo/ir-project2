They said the Sandinista troops had crossed about 3 miles intothe Honduran border province of Olancho, east of the capital ofTegucigalpa, and had remained in the area for 24 hours.   One official, who asked not to be identified, said theNicaraguan troops ``have been surrounded by our army ... and we areonly waiting superior orders to enter into action.''   ``There really is tension and there is crisis, however we areacting with prudence but with strength in these affairs, and wehope that everything will stabilize in the next two days,'' he said.   The Honduran military went on alert, the sources said, speakingon condition of anonymity.   Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras said that Honduras'president, Jose Azcono Hoyo, contacted Nicaraguan President DanielOrtega to demand the withdrawal of the troops.   Ortega has not confirmed the presence of Sandinista soldiers inHonduras, and the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry has denied anyincursion.   In Washington, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said theUnited States was dispatching 3,200 soldiers to southern Hondurasto carry out training exercises and to be ``a signal to thegovernments and the people of Central America.'' He said they wouldnot enter any combat zones.   Earlier, Fitzwater said Azcona had asked the United States forhelp in dealing with an invasion.   Intelligence officials said the Sandinista troops apparentlyentered Honduras to destroy a base camp of the U.S.-backed Contras.   ``We have done everything possible to avoid a confrontation thatwould drastically affect ... both countries,'' one source said.   The Superior Council of the Armed Forces, the country's highestmilitary body, was in session most of the day, the officials said.Earlier Wednesday, Azcona met for about six hours behind closeddoors to discuss the situation with top officials and the armedforces military chiefs.   Lopez Contreras told reporters at a news conference that themilitary command was reviewing battle plans in case the Sandinistaforces continued occupying Honduran territory.   In Managua, Ortega refused to confirm or deny that Nicaraguantroops had encroached on Honduran soil.   Lopez Contreras did not comment on reports that the Reaganadministration was dispatching U.S. troops to Honduras.   ``We don't want to create a national panic. We only ask ourcompatriots to have confidence in the government and in the armedforces,'' he said.   The foreign minister added that Azcona had demanded that Ortegaorder the ``withdrawal of the troops because they are raisingtensions and producing insecurity in the border.''   Azcona also asked presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador andGuatemala to appeal to Ortega ``to abstain from bringing aboutaggressive military actions against Honduras,'' Lopez Contrerassaid.   ``The government and the army are ready to put into action theright of legitimate defense,'' the foreign minister declared.   Military intelligence sources said that at least 2,000Sandinista troops were inside Honduras and that another 4,500 werenear the border in the Bocay region.</TEXT></DOC>
