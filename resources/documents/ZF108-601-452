(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>PV~Wave may not be the top of the wave, but it should eventually gainrespectable standing among the graphics packages for high-performanceworkstations.andP;  With the growing prevalence of graphics workstations and theirincreasing complexity and capabilities, graphics packages that allow bothinteractive and batch processing of data have become essential in certainfields.andP;  Without such packages, it is difficult and time-consuming to fullyutilize the capabilities of these and other high-performance computers.andP;  Inthis review I will present a brief overview of the features of PV~Wave, agraphics package distributed by Precision Visuals Inc. (Boulder, CO).andP;  Itested PV~Wave on a Sun-4/1 10 with a color monitor, 8 MB of RAM, and 280 MBof disk space.andM;InstallationandM;The installation kit for PV~Wave consists of a tape and an installationmanual.andP;  The installation procedure is very clear and accurate.andP;  If youfollow the instructions, it proceeds smoothly.andP;  There is just one minor itemI would like to see changed.andM;During the installation you are given the option of installing demonstrationfiles as well; the procedure informs you that the demonstration files willrequire about 12 MB of disk space-only after you have responded with theintent to proceed.andP;  It would be nice if the size requirement were knownbefore the installation go-ahead is given.andP;  However, since the proceduregives you another chance to discontinue, PV~Wave's installation still earns astraight A.andM;DocumentationandM;The documentation for PV~Wave comes in several parts: the main manual, ademonstration guide, the image-processing manual, a &quot;quick-reference&quot; guideto all functions and procedures, and an overview.andP;  The overview introduces byexample most of the capabilities of PV~Wave.andM;Unfortunately, the overview I received seemed to be for the VAX and not theSun version of the software.andP;  Several functions in this overview have namesdifferent from those in the Sun installation, which created a littleconfusion during my initial exposure to the package.andM;The main manual is in most parts comprehensive and includes a number ofexamples.andP;  I would, however, like to see a few more complicated examples thatgive users a more complete view of all of PV~Wave's capabilities.andM;The main manual's organization is haphazard at best.andP;  Information about thePV~Wave language is found in chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.andP;  Programming inthe language is described in chapters 7, 9, 13, 15, 16, and 18.andP;  Informationon displaying images and plotting functions is provided in chapters 10, 1 1,and 14, and a description of PV~Wave's fonts is in chapter 12.andP;  A morelogical arrangement would make working with the manual much easier.andM;Another drawback of the main manual is the brevity of some discussions,particularly the user-library routines in the appendix.andP;  In general, though,even the short descriptions coupled with some common sense give enoughinformation to understand and use any procedure.andM;The demonstration guide explains how to start the PV~Wave demonstrationsincluded on the distribution tape.andP;  It also briefly explains what parts ofPV~Wave each demonstration uses.andP;  But running the demonstrations alone doesnot help novice users become familiar with the system.andP;  The pretty picturesproduced by the demo files show off PV~Wave's capabilities, but would be moreuseful to salespeople trying to sell the product.andP;  The programs that run  thedemos, which fully utilize the software's capabilities, are of necessityrather complex, and this complexity makes the programs difficult for noviceusers to follow.andP;  For the experienced user, however, the demonstrationprograms provide some information on how to use the system.andM;The image-processing manual is a short description of procedures andalgorithms for processing and displaying images.andP;  It is necessarily brief,since the field of image processing is too complex to be fully covered in apractical introductory manual.andP;  Nevertheless, the guide is a good startingpoint.andM;PV~Wave's &quot;quick-reference&quot; guide is very valuable.andP;  It provides a listing ofall procedures and functions summarized under several headings.andP;  One verypositive feature of this guide is that the functions are listed several timesunder different headings.andM;The usage of on-line help is somewhat confusing.andP;  PV~Wave's help commandreturns status information about the PV~Wave environment.andP;  A better name forthis command would be status rather than help.andP;  On-line information about theusage of PV~Wave's features is summoned by typing a ?.andM;PV~Wave's help lets you examine more than one command without exiting thehelp facility.andP;  This would be a very nice feature if not for its excruciatingslowness.andP;  The user would also benefit greatly if PV~Wave's functions printedout their usage and parameters when they are called without parameters,replacing the correct but unhelpful error message, &quot;incorrect number ofarguments&quot;.andM;Feature SetandM;PV~Wave is a data-display system that can be used both interactively and in abatch mode.andP;  Users can write programs, procedures, and functions in thePV~Wave programming language to extend its standard feature set.andP;  Theseprograms can then be called interactively or from batch jobs.andP;  Thisenvironment is very versatile and makes data- and image-display chores easyto handle.andP;  PV~Wave provides all the functionality you need for mostscientific and technical data-analysis and  display problems.andM;Most of PV~Wave's display features can be controlled by parameters andkeywords in function calls, or through global system variables.andO;Automatically adjusted variables such as axis lengths and window sizes arereturned in global variables so they may be used in subsequent functioncalls.andP;  These global variables are useful for adjusting plot features, butsetting them interactively is an arduous task.andP;  A menu-driven utility thatadjusts display parameters would make these adjustments easier.andM;In addition to the standard PV~Wave commands, a fairly extensive user libraryis supplied on the distribution tape.andP;  It contains routines written by usersand is therefore not completely supported by the PV~Wave system.andP;  Thisextension of the normal feature set, however, is important to the utility ofthe package; many procedures contained in it make the package easier to use.andO;This user library is automatically accessible just like all the regularPV~Wave commands.andM;Programming LanguageandM;The PV~Wave programming language is a mixture of FORTRAN, BASIC, and Pascal,with some C mixed in.andP;  It is used for both interactive processing and forprogramming procedures and batch jobs, and is fairly easy to learn.andO;Unfortunately, the language is an inconsistent mix of syntactic features fromother languages.andP;  For instance, array indices run from 0, as in C, but thefirst index in multidimensional arrays varies first, as in FORTRAN.andO;Functions and procedures are called with the name of the function, followedby a comma and an argument list.andP;  This takes some getting used to, since itis easy to forget the first comma.andP;  The language does provide almost all thenecessary programming constructs and mathematical functions.andP;  The onlyconstruct missing is an easy-to-use ELSE-IF.andP;  The nesting of ELSE, IF, THEN,BEGIN, and ENDIF required to produce a simple ELSE-IF is very awkward.andO;Procedures and functions are automatically compiled and  saved in memory whencalled the  first time.andP;  This is a nice feature  and saves quite a bit oftyping  and housekeeping effort.andM;One of the most useful  features of the language is the support  of arrayoperations.andP;  All the mathematical functions can be used with either scalar orarray variables.andP;  if an array variable is used, the same operation isperformed on the whole array.andP;  One major drawback of the language is itsalmost complete lack of support for calling PV~Wave functions from otherlanguages, or vice versa.andP;  The only way to access procedures written in otherlanguages is to spawn a subprocesses and communicate with them through theirstandard input and output channels.andP;  This is very awkward and does not allowfor passing variables.andM;Calling PV~Wave procedures from C and FORTRAN is supported even lessthoroughly.andP;  Again, the only way is to spawn a PV~Wave program by passing thecalling string to a subroutine.andP;  Passing variables again is not possible.andO;This complicates using PV~Wave in situations where user-written functionsmust be used, as they must be re-written in the PV~Wave language to be fullyand easily usable.andM;Another minor irritation is the inability to read array elements from a file.andO;You can either read the whole array at once or read simple variables, but notindividual array elements.andP;  This necessitates some juggling with temporaryvariables.andP;  It's one of those things that causes you to ask yourself, &quot;Why inthe world did they do that?&quot;andM;X-Y PlotsandM;The routines that do x-y plots are easy to use, and their default settingsusually give you a good start for creating a display.andP;  Some of the plottingcapabilities include: linear and logarithmic axes, the ability to mark eachpoint with a different symbol (including user-defined symbols) , pointsconnected by different line types, histograms and bar graphs and fillingbetween curves.andP;  I especially liked the rounding for the axis limits (whichcan, incidentally, be turned off) ; this circumvents the creation of the oddaxis limits that sometimes occur with other plot packages.andP;  Sometimes,though, the rounding goes a bit too far and has to be turned off.andM;Titles and axis labels (including the values of the axes) can be passed asparameters or set through global variables.andP;  Additional text can be added tothe plot with a character-string plotting routine, and all text display canbe changed to any desired size, This enables you to create a particular lookeasily.andM;Being able to select the coordinate units for text display and other featuresis very useful.andP;  These units can be the data units of the plot, pixelcoordinates, or normalized coordinates.andP;  Information to convert between unitsis available through global variables.andP;  With this ability, it is very easy toposition text in a plot.andM;A genuine polar plot is missing.andP;  The polar plot available uses orthogonalaxes in units of the radius instead of radial and circular axes.andP;  Anotherannoyance is that the point symbols are not available to text-plottingroutine, precluding  the easy display of a legend.andM;2D-Array PlottingandM;The two-dimensional plotting functions available are contour, surface, andshaded-surface plots.andP;  Plotting shaded surfaces with light sources fromdifferent directions makes for very impressive displays.andP;  Again, the defaultsettings give you a good start, but all relevant parameters can be set eithertemporarily when the routine is called, or permanently through global systemvariables.andP;  Almost all aspects of the plots-such as the angle of rotation ofsurface plots and labeling of contours of the plots-can be set this way.andM;One parameter not available for change is the number of surface lines in aplot.andP;  If your data contain too mary points, the surface lines blend and asurface plot becomes useless.andP;  A parameter that sets the number of surfacelines would be beneficial.andM;Image DisplayandM;The image-display routines are used to display pixel images.andP;  Theyautomatically transform integer and floating-point data into the availabledisplay range.andP;  Routines exist to rescale this mapping to enhance contrast.andO;The use of these features and of different image-processing functions isexplained in the image-processing guide.andM;These routines seem to be the least reliable ones in the PV~Wave package.andP;  Onseveral occasions one or the other of these routines did not work properly.andO;The histogram routine does not work properly with integers, while theconvolution routine has problems with byte-sized data.andP;  With some work,though, these routines provide all the functionality you need.andP;  Anotherimage-display routine, movie, completely crashed PV~Wave and the window inwhich it was running.andM;One big drawback of the image-processing routines is that they cannot re-sizean image directly.andP;  Images have to be rescaled separately with routines suchas rebin or congrid.andP;  The routine rebin re-sizes an array to a given newdimension.andP;  it is limited by the requirement that the new dimensions must beintegral multiples or factors of the original dimensions.andP;  You cannot, forinstance, re-size a dimension of 100 to 150 with this function.andP;  For moreflexible re-sizing, the user-library function congrid is available.andP;  Thisfunction optionally uses a bilinear interpolation for the re-sampling, whichproduces quite satisfactory results.andM;In image processing, the absence of a good interface to routines written inother languages (as mentioned above) is felt most severely.andP;  Image processingoften involves user-written procedures.andP;  Unfortunately, you have to re-codeyour favorite enhancement procedure in the PV~Wave language if you want touse it with PV~Wave.andM;One more sorely missed item is the capability to easily zoom and pan.andP;  A zoomis available from the user library but its functionality leaves a lot to bedesired.andM;EnvironmentandM;When started up, PV~Wave displays the typical startup messages regardingcopyright, after which you are promised that certain function keys willperform certain functions.andP;  These function-key definitions never worked in myenvironment, but since the functions assigned to these keys are not terriblyimportant, I didn't think this was a major flaw.andP;  I tried to define thefunction keys myself, but this didn't work either.andM;The graphics output to the terminal is done in separate windows on a Sunworkstation.andP;  When a plot routine is called, it automatically opens agraphics window if none is open.andP;  Routines are available that open otherwindows and allow the user to switch between them.andP;  This can be very usefulwhen comparing different plots on the screen.andM;Several routines are available to load and manipulate color tables.andP;  Most ofthese are somewhat under-documented, but a little experimenting soon givesyou a feeling of how they can be used.andP;  A few problems exist, however-usingthese routines sometimes affects the background colors in undesirable ways.andO;For instance, pop-up menus sometimes appear with black letters on a blackbackground.andP;  The manual suggests calling a routine to prevent this fromhappening.andP;  The routine not only fails to prevent this problem, it alsocauses the cursor to appear black on a black background, rendering itinvisible.andM;One serious problem is that the color and gray-scale display in the graphicswindow is visible only when the cursor is positioned in that window.andP;  Thismeans you have to constantly shuttle your cursor between the shell window andthe graphics window when entering commands and watching the display.andP;  This issomething that definitely needs changing.andM;Another serious fault is the fact that all image-display functions cease towork when an image's window has been re-sized.andP;  A re-sized window must bedeleted and a new one created before any more images can be displayed, sinceonly the plot routines adapt to a re-sized window.andM;OutputandM;Graphics output is normally directed to the user's terminal.andP;  In my case thiswas the Sun console.andP;  When working on another graphics terminal, aTektronix-compatible command set will allow graphics images to be displayedthere, too.andM;Primary hardcopy output is handled by a Postscript driver.andP;  Commands areprovided to use either Postscript fonts or PV~Wave's vector fonts.andP;  ThePostscript driver together with a laser printer provides hardcopy output ofvery good quality.andP;  Tektronix-compatible output can be redirected to aplotter that accepts Tektronix graphics commands.andP;  The ability to generateHewlett-Packard-style plot commands would be a highly desirable feature.andM;Error HandlingandM;PV~Wave's error handling could benefit from more vendor attention.andP;  Its errormessages are sometimes, but not always, informative.andP;  Runtime-error messagesare much better than compiler messages.andP;  The compiler indicates that a syntaxerror has occurred and prints the line with the error, but no line number.andM;When a PV~Wave procedure is called with no parameters, the error messageincorrect number of arguments&quot; is displayed.andP;  Although accurate, it is notvery helpful.andP;  A better solution would be to inform the user of the correctusage and parameters of the procedure.andM;Using procedures or keywords that don't support the current output devicecauses the execution to be aborted.andP;  It would be better if occurrences likethese were ignored or if execution continued after an error message.andP;  Then,the same procedure can be used for screen and hardcopy output.andM;I encountered problems with a few PV~Wave procedures, but more often withroutines from the user library.andP;  These occurrences were not frequent enoughto constitute a serious problem, and decreased with time as I became morefamiliar with the product.andP;  One useful routine resets the PV~Wave environmentto its default values, to help the user escape from a messed-up environmentwhen all else fails.andP;  After experimenting with different parameter settingsit is easy to lose track of all the changes you have made, and the resetroutine will get you back on track and give you a fresh start.andM;SupportandM;PV~Wave supplies its customers with a toll-free telephone number for support.andO;The support people I talked to were not completely familiar with the package.andO;They could answer some questions immediately but had to do some research onmore difficult ones, causing some delays.andM;Calls were returned in as little as 15 minutes and as long as two weeks.andP;  Thenormal turnaround time was a few hours, which meant a call in the afternoonwas returned the next morning.andP;  This is not excellent but acceptable.andP;  Ingeneral the support was satisfactory.andM;If you are looking for a data-analysis and -display package, PV~Wave iscertainly worth checking out.andP;  With its comprehensive feature set, it isuseful for most data-analysis applications that require graphics displays inone form or another.andP;  Easy to learn and use, both interactively and in batchmode, PV~Wave should improve productivity and hasten your data-analysisprocess.andP;  With a laser printer, the hardcopy output is of publicationquality.andM;Guenther Eichhorn, this month's reviewer, received his PhD in physics in 1974in Heidelberg, West Germany.andP;  Over the years he has worked on differentaspects of astrophysical research, such as age determinations of lunarsamples and in situ measurements of cometary dust at Halley.andP;  His main focusin the last several years was on the development of specialized computersystems for various ground- and space-based astronomy and physicsexperiments.andP;  This included the development of specially reliable hardwareand software for space-based systems.andP;  He is now with the Steward ObservatorySpeckle Interferometry group developing a high-speed, real-time data-captureand -display system for a photon-counting Speckle camera.andM;Richard Morin, column editor, operates Canta Forda Computer Laboratory, aconsulting firm in San Bruno, CA, specializing in the application of UNIX toengineering and science.andP;
