The attorney general made the comment when asked aboutwidespread speculation that the Justice Department is preparing toblock the release of classified information in the case of formerCIA agent Joseph Fernandez.   Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,have indicated the Justice Department is poised to take that step.   Such a move could result in dismissal of charges that Fernandezlied about his covert involvement in shipping arms to theNicaraguan Contras when he was CIA station chief in San Jose, CostaRica.   Without saying what the government planned to do, Thornburghsaid: ``Our responsibility under the congressional directionscontained in the Classified Information Procedures Act is toreconcile the need to go forward with a particular criminal casewith the protection of vital national security information.''   ``That's a responsiblity we take seriously and any action thatis taken under that act is designed to balance those needs andcarry out our responsibility.''   ``If we do so, I'm not concerned,'' Thornburgh said when askedwhether he was concerned that if the department took such action inthe Fernandez case it would be blocking the use of informationabout CIA operations in Central America that is already widelyknown to the public.   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, whose office isprosecuting Fernandez, has contended that the Bush administrationwould be maintaining a diplomatic fiction by refusing to allow thedisclosure of CIA stations in Honduras and El Salvador.   The judge in the Fernandez case has ruled that the former CIAagent is entitled to disclose the specific locations in his defenseas well as the existence of several CIA programs.   Walsh has conceded the government's desire to protect the CIAprograms, saying he could narrow the charges against Fernandez ifthat information were suppressed.   U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton has already rejectedproposed substitutions for the information and it is not known ifhe would consent to narrowing the charges if that issue werepresented to him.   Thornburgh also dismissed suggestions that the Bushadministration would be merely trying to prevent the disclosure ofpolitically embarrassing information.   ``It is national security information,'' he said. ``We aren't inthe political business. We are charged by Congress with protectingnational security information that if disclosed would prejudice ournational security.   He called it ``a responsibility which we won't hesitate to carryout in a proper case.''   But Walsh has accused Thornburgh of trying to duck thatresponsiblity, delaying the start of the trial since July withappeals of Hilton's secrecy rulings and his refusal to let theJustice Department intervene directly in the case.   At one point, the independent counsel accused Thornburgh ofusing ``unannounced procedural maneuvers designed only to tie thiscase in a knot of endless litigation.''   Earlier this week, the Justice Department said it won't pressany further appeals of a 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal rulingthat it cannot intervene in the Fernandez case. That leaves theJustice Department with the option of filing an affidavit to blockrelease of secrets.</TEXT></DOC>
