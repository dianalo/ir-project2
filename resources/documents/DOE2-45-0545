TheCT image of bleomycin pneumopathy is variable. There are irregular, partlysharply defined nodular structures. They are generally found in periphericsites near to the pleura with the exception of the pleura mediastinalis.X-ray computed tomography does not only offer a qualitative informationon an existing pneumopathy, but provides also a precise localizationof these pulmonary alterations. Computed tomography is a method for thequantitative assessment of the peripheral lung density with the sameamount of information as the measurement of the gas transfer per pulmonaryvolume unity. However, it offers the advantage of a simultaneous qualitativevisual judgement of the organ. Thus quantitative computed tomographyrepresents an alternative in the assessment of the pulmonary function.According to the recommendations of Bellamy et al., it should be combinedto routine computed tomography of the thorax. The method of choice forthe diagnosis of anthracyclin cardiotoxicity is radionuclide ventriculography.A decrease of the left ventricle expulsion to less than 45% is consideredas a critical value. However, cardiac side effects of cytostatic drugscan be detected early in the individual course, so that late effectsin the sense of irreversible cardiomyopathy are preventd.</TEXT></DOC>
