Simulation results are presentedfor phantoms with realistic structures created by tracing the outlineof attenuatour and activity distribution on X ray-CT image of brain.The projections acquired at two different energies of /sup 111/In (171,245 keV) are manipulated to extract the true radioisotope distributionmodeling for regional brain perfusion study with /sup 123/I-IMP (N-Isopropyl-p-[/sup123/I] Iodoamphetamine). It is shown that the dual energy method reconstructsthe density on gray matter satisfactory, on the other hand, large densitydistortion is recognized in the region of white matter.</TEXT></DOC>
