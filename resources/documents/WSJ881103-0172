Duncan, corporate economist and chief statistician.    In the survey of 5,000 U.S. firms of varying sizes, about 11% said they plan to initiate export activities during the next 12 months.    Dun andamp; Bradstreet, which markets business information and related services, said that among the small companies that don't export now, 13% said their products are suitable for export. If these firms were to launch exports, companies with fewer than 100 workers would represent 37% of all exporting firms, Dun andamp; Bradstreet said.    But the survey also indicated that many small businesses are afraid to initiate export activity. When asked whether they believed that they were too small to export, more than 35% of small businesses answered affirmatively.    &quot;The hesitancy of some small firms not to export may be a function of an obstacle that exists, not in the marketplace, but in the mind of the business owner,&quot; Mr. Duncan said. </TEXT></DOC>
