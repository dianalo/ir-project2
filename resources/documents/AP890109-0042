A U.S. military spokesman said the attackers hurled sevenfirebombs at Camp Henry in the city 180 miles south of Seoul.   The American soldier was hurt when a firebomb was hurled throughthe windshield of the jeep he was driving, the spokesman said. Thefirebomb did not explode, but the soldier was cut by flying glass,he said.   U.S. authorities said they did not know why the base wasattacked, but the camp and other American bases in South Korea havebeen attacked in recent months by radical students demanding thewithdrawal of U.S. troops.   Police said today's attack involved five or six youths whoidentified themselves as ``patriotic students in Taegu'' in theleaflets they scattered. Police reported no arrest.   Police said the leaflets contained criticism of last Wednesday'sdowning by U.S. warplanes of two Libyan fighters over theMediterranean Sea.   It was the second attack on Camp Henry in a month. Radicalstudents chanting anti-U.S. slognas firebombed the camp on Dec. 27,cauing a small fire at a building. The fire was quickly extinguishedwith no injuries.   Dissidents and radical students have staged anti-Americanprotests demanding the withdrawl of some 42,000 U.S. troopsstationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact againstcommunist North Korea. They contend U.S. forces in the country helpperpetuate division of the Korean peninsula.   Korea was split into the communist north and the capitalist southin 1945, when U.S. and Soviet troops ended Japan's colonial ruleover the peninsula.</TEXT></DOC>
