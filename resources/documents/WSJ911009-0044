Joseph Biden (D., Del.)would question the primacy of economic rights during theThomas hearings (&quot;Biden's Nightmare: Economic Rights andSeparation of Powers&quot; by L. Gordon Crovitz, Rule of Law,Sept. 25). Economic rights are human rights. Without economicrights, other rights are hollow. The Soviet Union'sconstitution denied economic rights, but &quot;protected&quot; humanrights. Is the senator ignorant of the inability of Sovietcitizens to exercise those rights without economic rights?   The people of Delaware should elect someone with a lessreactionary view. If Bidenism spreads, Americans may have toface off with tanks, too.</LP><TEXT>   David Walter   Director   International Society for Individual Liberty   San Francisco</TEXT></DOC>
