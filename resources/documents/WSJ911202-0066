The settlement, which is expected to be announced formallytoday, marks another step by the St. Louis aerospace companyto put its finances in order. &quot;It's just another thing that'sgood to have behind us,&quot; said Herbert Lanese, McDonnellDouglas's chief financial officer.</LP><TEXT>   The extraordinary gain will total $50 million to $100million on a pretax basis, Mr. Lanese said. On top of that,an additional amount stemming from the settlement willprobably go toward establishing a reserve for other state andlocal tax obligations.   Meantime, the company has until the end of 1994 to pay theIRS &quot;just over $500 million&quot; in deferred taxes, Mr. Lanesesaid. But he added that the company, which has sharplyreduced its debt this year, would likely opt to pay the billsometime in late 1992. And if McDonnell Douglas completes itstentative agreement to sell up to 40% of its commercial jetbusiness to Taiwan Aerospace Corp. -- a move that couldresult in a $2 billion cash infusion -- the IRS payment couldcome even sooner.   The disagreement with the IRS revolved around the timingof tax payments for profit earned on military contracts fromthe mid-1970s through the mid-1980s. The government hadcontended that the company should pay its taxes as soon as itdelivered the last of a batch of products ordered by thePentagon. But McDonnell Douglas argued that it shouldn't payuntil the contract was completely closed out, which includedbuilding spare parts and performing certain warranty work.The issue, which has confronted the entire defensecontracting community, is now moot because the government inmore recent years has adopted a pay-as-you-go tax formula.   While all along, McDonnell Douglas set up a reserve todeal with the inevitable IRS payments, some analystsquestioned if it would be enough.   As it turned out, it was more than ample. The company putaside about $550 million in anticipation of making good onits deferred taxes, as well as $220 million in interest,according to Mr. Lanese. Recently, as part of the settlement,McDonnell Douglas agreed to pay the IRS $150 million in taxesthis year. In turn, the company received certain creditsagainst current tax liabilities.   Despite the IRS settlement, McDonnell Douglas still facesmany uncertainties. The Pentagon, for example, estimates thatthe company could still lose billions of dollars on the C-17,A-12 and T-45 aircraft programs; McDonnell Douglas conteststhis. Moreover, the company in October missed the deliveryrequirement on an Air Force laser system subcontract, whichcould result in a financial penalty.   But overall, the company continues to make progress inimproving its health by selling assets and cutting costs.According to its most recent quarterly filing with theSecurities and Exchange Commission, McDonnell Douglas alsoreached settlements under which it can defer payments to itsengine suppliers, further enhancing its cash position.   Most important is successful completion of the preliminaryaccord with Taiwan Aerospace, which could greatly bolsterMcDonnell Douglas's position in the airliner market. InWashington, the Joint Economic Committee is scheduled to holda hearing this week on the proposed transaction. The U.S.government, however, isn't expected to block the deal.</TEXT></DOC>
