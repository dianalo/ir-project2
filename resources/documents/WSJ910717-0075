One consumer advocate said the decision woulddestroy the AMA's reputation.   The medical reports, to be sent to doctors, are to includearticles that have been rejected by the Journal of theAmerican Medical Association and the AMA's specialtyjournals, an AMA spokesman said.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We run out of space,&quot; said Robert Kennett, AMA publishingvice president. &quot;Many of the things we do not publish aregood papers and deserve in some way to become part of theliterature.   &quot;In our view, publishing those papers is another way ofproviding more medical education . . . It has the samerigorous peer review as our journals. It's using a newrevenue source to pay for the publications.&quot;   Grants of $25,000 to $150,000 from drug companies will payfor the reports, which may contain drug advertising but nonerelated to the report's subject, Mr. Kennett said.   Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Washington-basedconsumer advocacy group Public Citizen, called the AMA'sexplanation a &quot;blatant lie.&quot; He said the AMA is trying tocash in on &quot;an enormous market&quot; for articles that have notbeen submitted to peer review or have been rejected byestablished editorial boards.</TEXT></DOC>
