In its final 24 hours, the campaign was nothing if not blunt.New York Mayor Ed Koch, a Gore supporter who has sharply criticizedJackson in recent days, was branded a ``lunatic'' by Jackson'scampaign manager.   Jackson said Koch's comments about him have ``not been good forthe city or the campaign.'' He also said the atmosphere in theprimary campaign has become ``so divisive and so violent'' that heis getting more death threats than at any time in his presidentialcampaign.   Jackson, who generally receives more threats than the othercandidates, travels with very tight security.   Jackson, meanwhile, went into the New York contest a winner. Hebeat out Dukakis in Monday night's Democratic caucuses in Delaware,taking 45 percent to Dukakis' 27 percent. Gore was a distant thirdwith 2 percent.   Dukakis, the leader in all the pre-election polls, steered wellclear of the Jackson-Gore-Koch hostilities. But he caused a flapwhen he refused to meet with reporters to discuss his early-morningcomment to one reporter that the U.S. action in the Persian Gulf asa ``measured response.''   On Monday, in a series of engagements, American forces destroyedtwo of Iran's Persian Gulf oil platforms, sank or damaged fourattack boats and disabled two frigates that fired missiles atAmerican planes, U.S. officials reported.   At appearances throughout the day, Dukakis said too little wasknown about the situation for him to comment. When reporters on hiscampaign plane learned of his initial remark and wanted to talk toDukakis about it, he dispatched an aide to tell them the earlycomment had been outdated by events in the gulf.   ``Just don't forget to vote tomorrow,'' the Massachusettsgovernor told an audience in Buffalo as he barnstormed through thefinal day of a costly, contentious primary campaign marked byracial and religious divisions.   Jackson, running second to Dukakis in the public opinion polls,staged three get-out-the-vote rallies in soggy Harlem. ``If youwill stand in the rain today you will vote in the raintomorrow...We've come too close, nothing can stop us now,'' he said.   The late pre-election polls gave Dukakis a lead over Jacksonmeasured in double digits with Gore a distant third, but even sothe pollsters fretted.   ``Nobody can predict for sure what the final combination ofblacks, Jews, Hispanics and white Catholics will be,'' said ABCNews pollster John Brennan. ``We could all be wrong. New York is akiller.''   Gore, struggling for survival in the Democratic race, sought toplace some distance between himself and the critical comments madeby Koch. ``The mayor is speaking for himself,'' the Tennesseesenator said as the two men campaigned side by side.   On the final rounds of a million-dollar campaign, Gore endorsedPresident Reagan's decision to take military action against Iran inthe Persian Gulf. He said the administration has ``every right'' todo what it did.   Koch was asked repeatedly about his weekend comments criticizingJackson. ``I'm not saying he's a liar. I'm saying he can't standstress, and then he lies under stress,'' he said.   He later said that if nominated, Jackson would lead theDemocratic party to its ``worst defeat'' since the Republicanlandslide year of 1972.   In a speech to the non-partisan Association for a Better NewYork, Jackson never mentioned Koch by name but referred to ``thosewho are inclined because of their fears to be bent towardhysteria.''   He went on, ``Leaders must set a high moral tone. I will notsurrender that tone to diversions.''   But his campaign manager, Gerald Austin, was less diplomatic.``Koch is a lunatic. By New York standards he is a lunatic,'' hesaid.   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who has spoken warmly of all threecontenders but endorsed no one, weighed in from Albany, saying thatKoch's tactic of ``attacking Jesse Jackson's character'' mightboomerang. Cuomo said he felt Gore chances had been hurt in NewYork because the Tennessee senator ``has been obscured by negativesmoke going up from attacks on others.''   While most eyes were on New York and the 255 Democratic NationalConvention delegates at stake in the primary, Delaware Democratsbegan the process of selecting 15 delegates to the party conventionnext summer.   On the Republican side, nominee-for-sure George Bush spent theday campaigning in Ohio, which holds its primary on May 3. Askedabout the air raid against Gulf platforms, he said, ``Our peopleunderstand it is appropriate to have a proper response when ourobligation is protection of sea lanes.'' The vice president has noactive opposition for the GOP nomination.   Dukakis leads the competition for Democratic National Conventiondelegates with 872, compared with 738 for Jackson and 417 for Gore,with 2,082 needed for nomination.   He has scored consecutive primary victories in Connecticut andWisconsin and caucus triumphs in Colorado and Arizona in the pastfew weeks, and is looking for a New York victory to certify him asthe front-runner and prohibitive favorite in the Democratic race.   ``We're looking forward to a great victory tomorrow here in thestate of New York, and we're going to get it,'' he said in Buffalo.   ``If we can win here tomorrow with your help, we're going to beon our way to the nomination, and I have no doubt that theDemocratic nominee for the presidency is going to beat George Bushin November,'' he said. From there, he traveled to New York for arally with cousin Olympia Dukakis, who was awarded an Oscar lastweek for her role in the movie ``Moonstruck.''   Turnout was the big unknown in efforts to predict the outcome onTuesday and Jackson spent the last full day of campaigning tryingto keep enthusiasm high.   The three Democrats also offered differing responses to theadministration military action in the Persian Gulf.   Jackson said the early morning fighting with Iran raised newquestions about U.S. policy. He said the weapons used againstAmerican troops were ``no doubt sold Iran illegally by theReagan-Bush administration.''   Gore said, ``Based on the facts presently available, I think theresponse was an appropriate one. It was a proportionate responsefor a clear act of hostility by Iran in laying mines intended todamage our ships and threaten the lives of our sailors.''   Dukakis said, ``We just don't have sufficient information for meto comment on what's happened in the Middle East in the last fewdays, and it would just be inappropriate for me to comment.''However, aides confirmed late Monday that he had initiallycharacterized U.S. action in the gulf as a ``measured response.''</TEXT></DOC>
