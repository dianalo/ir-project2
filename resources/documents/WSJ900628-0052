Analysts valuedeach of the contracts at between $2 billion and $5 billion.   Aramco, the state-owned Saudi Arabian company, is boostingits energy-producing capacity at a time when world-widedemand is on the rise. The project, which oil-industryexperts say could cost $40 billion over nine years, has beendivided into three parts, by geographic regions of thecountry.</LP><TEXT>   Fluor, based in Irvine, Calif., said its Fluor Daniel Inc.unit will act as overall program manager in the northernregion of Saudi Arabia. It will expand and de-mothballAramco's production facilities there, including its oil andgas plants, pipelines and offshore drilling platforms.   Parsons, a closely held Pasadena, Calif., engineering andconstruction concern, confirmed that it had received asimilar contract naming it program manager of the southernregion. A Parsons spokeswoman said she didn't believe that acentral-region manager had yet been named. Aramco officialscouldn't be reached for comment.   Les McCraw, Fluor vice chairman and chief executiveofficer, said, &quot;In a prospective way, it's the mostsignificant contract we've received in the last decade.&quot; Hewouldn't disclose the contract value, however, saying itwould be &quot;premature to speculate on how the program willunfold. Over the next several months, we will be definingcosts and determining schedules.&quot;   Parsons also declined to put a value on its contract ordiscuss other details of the award. The company's spokeswomansaid it was equivalent in nature to the Fluor award, however,and will include both engineering and construction work.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Fluor's stock rose 87.5 cents to close at $46 a share onvolume of 621,700 shares.   Fluor said it will start the project next month, workingprimarily out of its offices in Houston and in Al Khobar,Saudi Arabia. It will staff the effort with engineers alreadyon the payroll, Mr. McCraw said.   Fluor may be renovating some production facilities ithelped build in Saudi Arabia during the oil boom of the 1970sand early 1980s, he added. Unlike some other Americanengineering and construction companies that left the MiddleEast when oil prices fell, &quot;we stayed and did other things,&quot;he said.   Analysts expect other U.S. contractors to be involved inthe project, the largest by Aramco in nearly a decade. &quot;Thelast time we were looking at a multibillion contract fromSaudi Arabia was probably 1982,&quot; said Herbert Hart, ananalyst at S.G. Warburg andamp; Co. in San Francisco.   Companies he and other analysts mention as possibly vyingfor some of the new work include San Francisco-based BechtelGroup Inc.; the M.W. Kellogg Co. unit of Dresser IndustriesInc., Dallas; Foster Wheeler Corp., Clinton, N.J.; and theLummus unit of Asea Brown Boveri, a Swiss/Swedish industrialconcern.   Bechtel declined to comment. None of the other companiescould immediately be reached.   Mr. McCraw said he wouldn't be surprised to see severalother members of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries &quot;do something similar, maybe not of the same scopeand breadth, but similar. There is a desire for moreproduction capacity, driven by the perception of energygrowth over the decade of the 1990s.&quot;   Fluor's five-year contract includes options for four yearsof additional work on the project. The extent of the programis still being defined, Mr. McCraw said, but &quot;we will beinvolved in planning, analysis and direct execution of theengineering effort&quot; as well as defining the role ofsubcontractors.   Mr. McCraw said that because Aramco intends to release thework over several years, the financial impact it will have on&quot;any single quarter or year for us is still uncertain. Weintend to be conservative in reporting this work in ourbacklog.&quot; He added, however, that Saudi Arabia will pay Fluorin dollars, rather than in barrels of oil, as analysts claimit has paid other U.S. companies in the past.</TEXT></DOC>
