(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tropical Storm Chris spawned tornadoesthat damaged houses, destroyed mobile homes and caused at least onedeath in the Carolinas before gradually weakening, losing its nameand heading toward Virginia today.   High wind from the third named storm of the 1988 Atlantichurricane season also left thousands temporarily without power inthe Carolinas, and heavy rain flooded highways in South Carolina.   The storm, which sprang to life from a tropical depression offFlorida, packed its strongest punch when it came ashore Sunday inSouth Carolina.   About 75 miles inland from the historic port city of Charleston,S.C, a tornado touched down in a sparsly populated area anddevastated mobile homes, said Bob Kelly, a meteorologist with theColumbia office of the National Weather Service.   ``The winds took a swath, probably a half a mile long andquarter of a mile wide,'' said Clarendon County Fire Chief CarterJones.   Mary Lemon, 78, was killed when winds leveled her mobile homewhile her granddaughter, 12-year-old Celessie Pearson, suffered asevere back injury, said County Coroner Ranny Stephens. Thechildwas listed in critical but stable condition today at RichlandMemorial Hospital in Columbia.   Between 15 and 30 mobile homes in Clarendon County weredestroyed when the tornado hit, said county Fire Chief CarterJones. U.S. Highway 301 was closed while authorities cleared it ofdebris from the battered mobile homes, he said.   ``It was a mess,'' said Carl Floyd, an engineer with the countyFire Department. ``It took trailer houses and threw them clearacross the road. It was a complete disaster for the area.''   One tornado in North Carolina threw a tractor-trailer rig into abuilding at an Iredell County industrial park, officials said.   At 7 a.m., the center of the storm was over south-centralVirginia, about 30 miles south of Roanoke, and was moving towardthe north-northeast at 20 mph, forecasters reported. Rain from thestorm was expected as far north as southeastern New York by latertoday, said the weather service in New York City.   On Sunday evening, the storm was downgraded to a tropicaldepression, located near Columbia with maximum sustained winds of30 mph in squalls.   Winds with gusts to 44 mph in Charleston cut power to anestimated 18,000 customers in coastal South Carolina and destroyedone mobile home and overturned another near the community of Olanta.   Several hundred households were without electricity this morningafter high winds and rain toppled some trees and utility poles.Wayne Ennis of   In North Carolina, Carolina Power andamp; Light Co. said about 2,000people lost power north of Oxford and outages also were reported inseveral other communities.   Forecasters predicted 3 to 5 inches of rain along the storm'strack across South Carolina and into North Carolina.   Parts of Charlotte, N.C., reported up to 3.5 inches of rain lateSunday with more than 1 inch falling at Greensboro during the threehours ending at 4 a.m., the weather service said.   ``I think it will certainly help in some respects,''meteorologist Larry Lee said today in Raleigh, N.C. ``But it's muchtoo late to help crops. In terms of areas with groundwater andreservoir problems, I think this storm will help.''   The storm also spawned tornadoes in North Carolina that uprootedtrees, damaged mobile homes and tore shingles off roofs. But noinjuries were reported there.   Iredell County, N.C., received the brunt of the violent weather,with property damages estimated at $1 million. Tornadoes also werereported in Alexander, Catawba and Cumberland counties, officialssaid.   Steve Vann, 21, watched one tornado touch down in Cumberland,near Fayetteville.   ``I seen it hit the ground about 3:30 p.m. The wind got towhipping up pretty good, clouds moving in a tornado like motion,then it quit raining. All of a sudden, it came out of nowhere,''Vann said. ``It sounded just like somebody throwing a match ongasoline _ Whoosh!''   The storm left some Iredell County residents without gas orelectricity, authorities said.   During Saturday and into early Sunday, Chris strengthened into atropical storm from a lopsided tropical depression that threatenedFlorida's eastern coast. Depressions are upgraded to named stormswhen their maximum sustained wind hits 39 mph, and to hurricaneswhen sustained wind blows at least at 74 mph.</TEXT></DOC>
