Apcar (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> WOR </CO><IN> TNM BNK </IN><TEXT>   Worthen Banking Corp., Arkansas's largest banking concern, is trying to sell one of its troubled banks in a bid to shrink Worthen's assets and shore up its capital level, in line with an agreement with federal bank regulators.    Officials close to the negotiations say that Little Rock, Ark.-based Worthen is attempting to sell its bank unit in Hot Springs, Ark. Kemmons Wilson Inc., a diversified Memphis real estate, insurance and manufacturing company led by Kemmons Wilson, the founder of Holiday Inns, delivered a non-binding letter of intent to Worthen to pursue the possible purchase of the bank. The letter, which expires by the end of this month, allows Kemmons Wilson officials to examine detailed financial data on the bank.    A sale of Worthen's First National Bank of Hot Springs would go a long way toward polishing up Worthen's tarnished balance sheet and could help Worthen regain its profitability after years of losses. By selling the unprofitable bank, which had average assets of $269 million last year, Worthen's assets would slide to about $1.55 billion from slightly more than $1.8 billion currently. And its ratio of primary capital to assets could climb comfortably over the 7% mark later this spring, a goal mandated for Worthen by the Federal Reserve Board. Losses at the Hot Springs bank have accounted for the bulk, if not all, of Worthen's recent quarterly net losses.    Worthen's primary capital level, the combination of shareholder equity and loan loss reserve, was 6.01% at Sept. 30. Because of pressure from the Fed to boost its capital level to 7%, Worthen had considered raising capital through the sale of Worthen stock or debentures but dropped the idea after potential buyers expressed interest in the Hot Springs bank, and the stock market crashed.    Shedding the bank unit would relieve Worthen of the task of having to recapitalize the Hot Springs bank, which, as previously reported, has been on the federal government's &quot;problem&quot; bank list. These banks are considered by regulators to have serious weaknesses at best and, at worst, to be in danger of failing without corrective action. Worthen said that it took several corrective steps last year at Hot Springs, including an extensive loan review, and that the bank's condition is improving.    But, according to regulatory data, the Hot Springs bank's $13 million in primary capital is slightly less than regulators require and its $3.5 million in equity capital, or 1.3% of assets, is considered wafer thin. Equity capital is the clearest picture of a bank's net worth and its ability to absorb additional losses.    Officials involved in the discussions say that in addition to Mr. Wilson's company, possible investors include G. Michael Sigman, the former president of the bank who was fired last year after additional losses were detected, and Patrick Parker, a Hot Springs businessman who is involved in a separate transaction with a Kemmons Wilson entity. On Thursday, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Sigman confirmed their interests in buying the bank but neither would indicate whether they would follow through with a purchase. Mr. Parker's office said he couldn't be reached. Mr. Wilson's company already owns a small savings bank in West Memphis, Ark., a formerly troubled thrift he purchased last year and recapitalized. Robert T. Gammill, president of the thrift, says the Kemmons concern is interested in investing in other financial institutions.    Worthen officials declined to comment on the negotiations to sell the Hot Springs bank. However, Curt Bradbury Jr., Worthen's president and chief executive officer, has said that his plans for raising Worthen's capital include, &quot;rationalization of the total size of this company,&quot; referring to the sale of some Worthen assets. In the past three years, Worthen has sold two other banks.    It is understood that the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, which supervises Worthen, is reviewing Mr. Bradbury's plan to boost Worthen's capital level by selling the bank unit. A spokeswoman for the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank said the bank &quot;could neither confirm or deny&quot; that it is reviewing Worthen's plan.    Included in Mr. Bradbury's capital plan, as previously reported, is at least $25 million Worthen expects to receive from net recoveries from the federal bankruptcy court proceedings of Bevill, Bresler andamp; Shulman Inc., Livingston, N.J., and an affiliated company, as well as insurance company payments from a proposed settlement of a shareholder derivative lawsuit filed by Worthen shareholders in 1985. The lawsuit, filed after Worthen sustained a widely publicized $52 million loss from the collapse of the Bevill Bresler companies, seeks recoveries for Worthen rather than for the suing shareholders.    Officials close to the discussions said a price for the Hot Springs bank hasn't been discussed. </TEXT></DOC>
