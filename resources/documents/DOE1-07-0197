An intraarterial DSA (IADSA)and three intravenous DSA (IVDSA) were performed on three patients withcerebral venous thromboses. Diagnostic information was obtained in allof the cases. The IVDSA was much less invasive than conventional angiography,and it was able to evaluate the cerebral circulation of bilateral carotidarteries and vertebral arteries at the same time. We want to emphasizethe advantage of IVDSA in making a diagnosis of this disease for a poor-riskpatient and for a follow-up patient. The future development of DSA shouldbe directed toward the improvement of the spatial resolution and towarddecreasing the dose of the contrast medium.</TEXT></DOC>
