In addition, the book reviews techniquesin molecular neurobiological research, including the use of affinityreagents, chimeric receptors, and site-directed mutagenesis in localizingthe ion channel and cholinergic binding site, and the application ofsomatic cell genetics in isolating specific chromosomes or chromosomalsegments.</TEXT></DOC>
