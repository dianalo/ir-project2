The storm dumped more than 8 inches of snow in north-centralIndiana by Friday morning and 2 to 6 inches over much of Illinois,Ohio, southern Michigan and southeast Wisconsin.   Farther south, cities in Georgia, Alabama, Florida and Missourilogged record lows and officials there fretted over findingshelters for the homeless.   The snow was a mixed blessing for Indiana farmers, whose cropshad been damaged by previous frosts.   ``It has pretty much stopped harvest,'' said Greensburg farmerJeff Smiley. However, a Purdue University pathologist said the coldweather will suppress the growth of damaging molds.   A tourist official for the Brown County Convention and VisitorsBureau in southern Indiana bemoaned the snow's abrupt intrusion onthe foliage display that annually attracts thousands ofleaf-peepers to the area 40 miles south of Indianapolis.   ``We just had a travel writer come in from Iowa, and he wasdisappointed there was no sunshine,'' said Mary Fredericksen, salesmanager for the convention bureau.   The winter preview appeared likely to leave as fast as it came.Highs in the mid-50s to low 70s were forecast for Saturday andSunday for most of the Midwest.   About 10,000 Cincinnati-area utility customers were stillwithout power Friday afternoon. Cincinnati Gas andamp; Electric Co.spokesman Bruce Stoecklin said about 350 workers were on the job,including tree-trimming contractors who were removing fallen limbsfrom power lines.   Power was restored Friday to about 14,000 electricity customersin Dayton.   About 17,000 people were without power in southern Michigan,mostly in the Detroit area. Four to 6 inches of snow was reportedin Gaylord, in the northern Lower Peninsula.   Twenty trucks were out salting Chicago roadways, said KirstinSvare, a spokeswoman for the city's Streets and Sanitationdepartment, but warmth from Lake Michigan kept the sleet fromturning to snow.   A freeze warning was in effect Friday night for all of northernFlorida, with temperatures across the region expected to dropovernight into the upper 20s to lower 30s.   Plants that normally withstand cold temperatures may be damagedbecause the cold spell comes right after unseasonably warm weather,said Charles Guy, a plant physiologist for the Institute for Foodand Agricultural Sciences in Gainesville.   But frost is expected to extend only to Marion County, nearGainesville, causing little impact on the citrus industry farthersouth, he said.   Miami Beach broke a 34-year-old record low with a 58-degreereading. West Palm Beach managed to set two records within 18hours, a high of 92 Thursday and a low of 56 Friday. Tallahasseebottomed out at 34, Pensacola chilled to 35, Apalachicolaregistered 42, Daytona Beach 44, and Orlando 46 _ all records forthe day.   An overnight freeze warning also was in effect for all ofGeorgia.   The early cold weather sparked concern for shelter for theestimated 100,000 homeless in the Atlanta area. Shelters normallydo not open until Nov. 1, but emergency overflow shelters wereopened Thursday.   ``In the next couple of days we really have no provisions. Ourshelters are packed and have been all summer,'' said LynnBrockwell-Carey, housing manager at Cobb County Emergency Aid,northwest of Atlanta.</TEXT></DOC>
