Wright's lawyers will argue that the two most serious sets ofcharges brought against their client by the House ethics committeeshould be dismissed because the panel, reacting to a new moralclimate, has stretched the rules beyond their original intent.   ``We are hoping for a clear interpretation that the ruleshaven't changed on us,'' Wright said.   But Wright's lawyers concede such motions are routinely deniedand give the speaker less than even chance of winning a pre-emptivedismissal of the charges.   William C. Oldaker, one of Wright's lawyers, said last week thatin a best-case scenario, the odds of succeeding with such a motionwould be 50-50; in this case, he conceded that the odds could besomething less than that.   And a growing number of House Democrats are saying that whilethe ethics process is important, it may ultimately prove irrelevantto the speaker's political fortunes.   ``It would be nice if he could be in a position to defend hiscase on the merits before he has to face the question of what thepolitical consequences are,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who hasargued that the rules are on Wright's side.   Stephen D. Susman, a hard-nosed trial lawyer brought in thismonth to bolster the defense team, is expected to argue that thecommittee misapplied the rules in two ways:   _In charging Wright with evading limits on outside earned incomethrough bulk sales of his book, ``Reflections of a Public Man,''the panel ignored a rule specifically exempting book royalties fromthe limit.   House rules place a cap on money earned from speaking fees at 30percent of congressional salary. The ethics panel said that inseven instances, Wright sold bulk quantities of books to groups hehad spoken to, and that the sales were really disguised speakingfees which he otherwise wouldn't have been able to accept.   ``No rule of the House, no advisory opinion, no prior cases andnot one shred of legislative history ... supports the outsidespecial counsel's revisionist approach to the copyright royaltyexemption,'' the lawyers argue in a statement.   _Charges that Wright improperly accepted $145,000 in impropergifts from George Mallick, a Fort Worth real estate developer andbusiness partner of the speaker, are based on a finding thatMallick had a direct interest in legislation before Congress.   Over a period of nearly 10 years, Mallick gave Wright and hiswife, Betty, use of a car and a condominium in Fort Worth, and from1979 through 1984 paid Mrs. Wright an $18,000-a-year salary. Thecommittee found reason to believe those amounted to gifts, and thatMallick had a stake in legislation because of his many investments.House rules bar acceptance of more than $100 in gifts annually fromany such person.   An ethics committee advisory opinion defines the direct intereststandard as ``a distinct or special interest in influencing oraffecting the federal legislative process which sets the individualor organization apart from the general public.''   Chicago lawyer Richard J. Phelan, the ethics committee's specialoutside counsel in the case, will defend the panel's rulesinterpretation at the hearing Tuesday.   The dismissal motion essentially asks the ethics committee toabandon rules interpretations it earlier had decided to accept.Committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., last week characterizedthe panel's original decision as ``very well founded.''   Wright's defense team is not challenging, at least for themoment, charges that he failed to report the Mallick benefits asgifts on his annual financial disclosure forms, a relatively minorconcern.   Following the hearing, expected to take about six hours, thecommittee will meet later in the week to rule on the dismissalmotion. Any remaining charges then would become the subject of adisciplinary hearing.   Wright and his advisers, hoping to avoid prolonging what hasbecome a daily barrage of negative news stories and newallegations, are expected to ask that the committee begin thetrial-like hearing immediately. Dixon has said the hearing wouldprobably take more than a week. The panel then would rule onwhether the charges have been proved with clear and convincingevidence, and could recommend sanctions to the full House.   The House is free to accept, reject or modify therecommendation, but many lawmakers say it is most likely that thechamber would simply accept whatever the ethics panel suggests.</TEXT></DOC>
