Grain futures ended mixed with new-crop wheat prices risingstrongly.   Analysts were somewhat bewildered by the performance of thesoybean market, which had opened lower after a powerful advance onThursday.   Mickey Luth, grains analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,said underlying support was provided by strong world demand forsoybean meal and by the slow pace of soybean and soymeal exportsfrom South America due to harvest delays and sweeping economicreforms in Brazil.   But analysts said there had been no change Friday in supply anddemand factors that might account for the surge in the soybeanmarket. Friday's rally was led by speculative funds, they said.   The soybean market also may be reflecting speculation that thepast week's unusually warm, dry Midwestern weather could extendinto the growing season, analysts said. But they added that it istoo early in the growing season to worry about a repeat of the 1988drought.   At the close, wheat futures were { cent lower to 5} cents higherwith the contract for delivery in May at $3.70 a bushel; corn was 1cent lower to 3 cents higher with May at $2.79} a bushel; oats were1 cent lower to 2\ cents higher with May at $1.62{ a bushel;soybeans were 7 cents to 11} cents higher with May at $6.36 abushel.</TEXT></DOC>
