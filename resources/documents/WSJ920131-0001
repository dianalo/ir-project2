Macke offered the usual reasons that hisclient, the father of two boys, should get custody after thedivorce. Then he called in the artillery: schools expertWilliam L. Bainbridge.   Mr. Bainbridge testified before the judge that the schoolsin Vanceburg, Ky., where the child's mother was moving,ranked &quot;low&quot; in awards and &quot;very low&quot; in scholarship-testperformance, while the Columbus, Ohio, school that thechildren attended ranked &quot;high.&quot; Once both parents heard thetestimony, they agreed that the father would get custodyduring the school year, the mother during the summer.</LP><TEXT>   More and more, family lawyers say, the quality of schoolsis coming up and becoming a matter of heated dispute in suchdivorce and custody cases. The trend may reflect the increasein two-career couples, in which neither partner is likely tospend as much time with the children as school personnel willspend with them.   Some lawyers don't think so much emphasis should be put onschool systems, as opposed to the parent-child relationship,and criticize the trend sharply. But bringing in experts canbe a &quot;heavy-duty factor&quot; in influencing judges, said Gary N.Skoloff, a New Jersey lawyer and immediate past president ofthe American Bar Association's family law section.   Typically, the experts include local officials at theschools in question. But some lawyers prefer to use Mr.Bainbridge's firm, Public Priority Systems Inc. in Columbus,because its statistical analysis of schools can beparticularly convincing. The firm, a closely held companyfounded in 1983, is believed to be the only one involvednationally as a consultant in custody cases. The company has12 employees in Ohio and about 30 consultants throughout theU.S., Mr. Bainbridge said.   Public Priority's SchoolMatch database, originallydesigned to help corporations relocate employees, ranks35,000 schools by dozens of factors, such as teacher salariesand the number of students in each building. The results,used by more than 300 major companies, are printed out in&quot;report cards&quot; for each school.   Mr. Bainbridge, 46 years old, frequently testifies incourt, where he goes through the report card numbers whileadding perspective from his visits to the schools. In thepast three years, he has been retained by about 100 lawyersin custody disputes, he said.   Kansas City attorney Scott H. Kreamer recalls the case ofa Missouri mother in Shawnee Mission, Kan., who wanted tomove her boy to a school in Richmond, Mo. Public PrioritySystems presented each school's national rank. ShawneeMission was ranked in the 73rd percentile for spending oninstruction, the 70th for buildings and the 81st for teachersalaries, whereas Richmond was only ranked in the ninth,fourth and 11th percentiles for those categories. Thetestimony persuaded the child's guardian to take the father'sside, Mr. Kreamer said.   The focus on school data attracts some harsh criticism,however. &quot;The best interest of the child is not necessarilythe best school, for the same reason that it's not therichest parent,&quot; said Helene Brezinsky, a partner in the NewYork law firm Rosenman andamp; Colin. &quot;People spend years intherapy not because of the schools they attended,&quot; she said.   Lawrence Stotter, of Stotter andamp; Coats in San Francisco,agreed: &quot;It's better for a child to go with an inferiorschool if they are having a more positive relationship with aparent with whom it's in the child's interest to be.&quot;   Nonetheless, he added, &quot;In many custody cases, quality ofschools is a common concern of the courts and of the parties.Any way to get useful data on that issue is a goodcontribution.&quot;   Manhattan Family Court Judge Jeffry Gallet said he paysmost attention to school comparisons when a child has specialneeds and when only one of the proposed schools has programsfor such children. &quot;If I'm dealing with a normal, healthychild who's got a B average, school match is not going to bea major issue.&quot;   Some critics of the statistical evidence said it can bemore effective simply to call school administrators aswitnesses. Barbara Handschu, chairwoman of the New York statebar's family law section, said she likes to use schoolsuperintendents, who bring a human element to the witnessstand that sheafs of numbers lack.   Many family lawyers also argued that numbers can't showhow good a school is, anyway. Although Mr. Macke, theColumbus lawyer, is a believer in the SchoolMatch database,even he sees its limitations. &quot;After all,&quot; Mr. Macke said,&quot;Abraham Lincoln grew up reading his studies at a fireside.&quot;   ---   COURT BARS LAW FIRM from doing work for client'scompetitors.   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision strongly rebukedthe old-line Philadelphia law firm Pepper, Hamilton andamp; Scheetzfor dumping an oil-and-barge company that it had representedin labor negotiations so it could handle negotiations forseven of the company's competitors.   In a 30-page opinion, the state high court upheld a lowercourt order barring Pepper Hamilton from negotiating laborcontracts for the competing companies on the ground that thefirm was privy to confidential corporate information from itsformer client. Labor negotiations are a key aspect oflong-term planning in the oil and barge industry.   The opinion is believed to be the first in the country tospell out how law firms can expose themselves to a conflictof interest and charges of ethical impropriety when theyrepresent two clients in the same industry for the samepurpose, such as labor negotiations.   &quot;It's the first case that pulls it all together, thatexplains it and justifies it. I think it's going to be a muchcited opinion,&quot; said Charles Wolfram, a legal-ethicsspecialist at Cornell University Law School who testified asan expert on behalf of the plaintiff in the case,Philadelphia-based Maritrans G.P. Inc.   Most major law firms have multiple clients that competewithin the same industry. Conflicts are usually avoided bydividing work in different areas of specialty or by makingsure that lawyers for one client have no involvement withlawyers for another. Such practices are defended so long asone client's interest doesn't come into conflict withanother's.   In its decision, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court made clearthat it was not barring law firms from representingcompetitors of clients or former clients. &quot;But situations maywell exist where the danger of revelation of confidences of aformer client is so great that {an injunction} is warranted,&quot;the court added. &quot;This is such a case.&quot;   In this case, Pepper Hamilton had represented Maritransfor a decade and learned the company's &quot;complete innerworkings,&quot; then dropped the company in December 1987 torepresent seven of its competitors in labor negotiations,according to the opinion. Two of the firm's partners laterdisclosed information from a prior strategy session withMaritrans to a third Pepper Hamilton lawyer who representedthe competitors.   After Maritrans sued, Philadelphia Common Pleas JudgeAbraham J. Gafni ruled in April 1989 that an injunctionagainst Pepper Hamilton was appropriate to guarantee &quot;a senseof assurance that Pepper attorneys will, in the future, guardits confidences, and that they will not be disclosed or used,even inadvertently.&quot;   Yesterday's state supreme court decision upheld thatopinion after it was overturned by a state appeals court. Thehigh court ruling, according to Maritrans's attorney, RichardA. Sprague in Philadelphia, &quot;makes clear that a lawyer and alaw firm have a fiduciary duty to a client that comes aheadof business needs.&quot;   (Maritrans GP Inc. vs. Pepper, Hamilton andamp; Scheetz, Pa.Supreme Court, Eastern District, J-21-1991)   ---   NOTED: A 63-year-old woman was selected as this year's&quot;Outstanding Young Lawyer&quot; by the New York State BarAssociation.
