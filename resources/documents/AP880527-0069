Foreign Minister Roelof ``Pik'' Botha and Tutu, the Noble PeacePrize-winning Anglican prelate, were interviewed separately onABC-TV's ``Nightline'' show Thursday.   Tutu criticized the United States for failing to take toughersteps against South Africa to induce that country to abandonapartheid, the policy of racial separation.   ``We are saying, `Look, in South Africa, many of the things thatyou hold dear are being treated with considerable disdain. Whydon't you do something that will indicate to the South Africangovernment and to the victims that you actually do mean what yousay?''' Tutu said.   Botha, meanwhile, claimed that ``in general, black SouthAfricans have more effective civil rights than black Americans.''   ``You do not want to have a proper analysis of our dilemma,''Botha said. ``You simply ascribe to us the worst motives. We appealto the black Americans to try to understand that in many instancesblack South Africans enjoy better medical facilities, betterhousing facilities, better education and greater prospects ofpower-sharing than black Americans will ever enjoy.''   Tutu said that despite the South African government's relaxationor elimination of some apartheid policies, ``those steps have notcome about as a result of any significant conversion on their part.... Political power still remains very firmly in the hands of thewhite minority and until we deal with that problem we are playingmarbles.''   Responding to a question about whether economic sanctions wereeffective, he said, ``if in fact sanctions are as ineffective as weare being led to believe, why are the South African government, theprivate sector ... jumping around like scalded cats, as if they hadants in their pants?''   Botha argued that the sanctions and the withdrawal of someindustries ``mean robbing our black people of jobs, of sendingtheir families into starvation.''   He claimed a poll had shown that 75 percent of his country'sblacks opposed sanctions. When asked why the government would notallow blacks to express such views by allowing them to vote, Bothadenied that blacks are being denied political power.</TEXT></DOC>
