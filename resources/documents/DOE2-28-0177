An effective means of mappingthese features is needed in order to plan safe and efficient mine development.This report discusses the use of surface seismic techniques for thispurpose. At a southwestern Pennsylvania mine, a system of coal-bed discontinuities(paleochannels) was accurately mapped by the Bureau of Mines using boreholelog methods and underground observation. The site was chosen to testthe value of a high-resolution surface seismic-reflection technique forcoal-bed mapping.</TEXT></DOC>
