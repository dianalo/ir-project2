The hostile, $21 billion offer from an investor group led byAnglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith certainly isAmerican-sized.   It would be the second-largest takeover in the world after therecord $25 billion purchase of U.S.-based RJR Nabisco Inc. by theNew York investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. earlier thisyear. It would be four times the size of the previous biggestBritish bid.   The bidders offer no cash and instead are using an Americanfinancing technique not readily accepted on this side of theAtlantic: junk bonds.   Both sides have lined up U.S. soldiers: leading Americaninvestment bankers. In addition, many of the battles are expected totake place on U.S. soil: in American courts and before U.S.insurance regulators, due to BAT's ownership of American insurancecompanies.   ``If you're sitting there as an aggressor trying to figure outwhat the defensive strategy would be, you would figure they woulduse American advisers and you would try to cut them off at the passand get the best ones,'' said Clive Sherling, a director of theLondon buyout firm Alan Patricof Associates Ltd.   London-based BAT, a diversified conglomerate, has wide-ranginginterests in the United States. It owns Brown and Williamson TobaccoCorp., Farmers Insurance Group Inc. and the Saks Fifth Avenue andMarshall Field's department stores.   Forty-one percent of BAT's pre-tax profit and 30 percent of itsrevenue came from North America last year.   The bidding group, which includes British investor JacobRothschild and Kerry Packer, an Australian entrepreneur, launchedthe bid Tuesday through a newly formed company, Hoylake InvestmentsPLC. BAT immediately rejected it.   On Thursday, BAT said it dropped a planned $400 million noteissue, which was to have been completed Monday. It would have beenone of the biggest Eurobond offerings ever by a non-American company.   ``The issue has been withdrawn following the disruption of themarket for these securities as a result of the Hoylake bid,'' BATsaid in a statement.   It said it wanted to protect investors, who it said would havefaced substantial losses because of ``the hostile and highlyleveraged nature of the bid.''   ``Now that BAT is under siege,'' said Kevin Phillips, an analystwith the London investment firm Kleinwort Benson Ltd., ``they aremerely taking a prudent route.''   BAT's shares fell 15 pence, or about 24 cents, to finish at 862pence, or $14.05, Thursday on London's Stock Exchange. The biddinggroup's offering price is 850 pence, or $13.86 a share.   Junk bonds, such as the ones the Goldsmith group is offering, arenot as widely used or accepted in Britain, where high-debt venturesare less common. Junk bonds are high-yield, high-risk securities.   Also new to the relatively staid British takeover scene would bethe breakup of such a large company. Goldsmith said he wanted to``unbundle'' BAT by selling its non-tobacco interests.   In the BAT war, the offense has lined up U.S. junk bond pioneersDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Bankers Trust Co.'s financing pros.Its legal advisers include Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, aU.S. law firm on the takeover forefront.   The defense quickly enlisted Goldman Sachs and Co. and ShearsonLehman Hutton Inc. to help Lazard Brothers and Co. plot itsstrategy. All three are American brokerages.   American investment firms, which are particularly aggressive,have been leaders in developing sophisticated takeover andanti-takeover techniques.   BAT's defense likely would be a management buyout, said Sherling.``I'm sure that it would be led from the States and therefore byhaving American advisers they would have a more direct line to thecash.''   Of course, Americans don't have the lock on the takeover market.Both sides' armies include powerful British firms. BAT has S.G.Warburg and Co. The bidders have James Capel and Co.</TEXT></DOC>
