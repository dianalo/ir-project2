The decision caps a year of study and internal NATO controversyabout how to respond to the disbanding of the Canadian Air-SeaTransportable brigade, which had been committed to Norway for 19years.   The Norwegian government had criticized the Canadian move,saying failure to replace the brigade would weaken the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization's ability to stop attacks on itsnorthern flank.   Canada said in June 1987 it would offset the move by adding toits forces in West Germany.   The alliance's Defense Planning Committee adopted outlines of aplan for creating an army unit of U.S., West German and Canadiantroops that would be designated as early reinforcements for Norwayin times of tension.   A NATO announcement said Gen. John R. Galvin, the chiefcommander of alliance forces in Europe, was negotiating terms of a``composite force'' for Norway. It said details would be worked outlater.   ``This will enhance NATO's overall deterrence in a time oftension ... demonstrate alliance solidarity and reinforce thedefense of this vitally important region in a crisis,'' theannouncement said.   The problem of reinforcing northern Norway stems from the Oslogovernment's long-standing policy of prohibiting the stationing offoreign troops on its soil in peacetime. It also prohibits alliancemilitary maneuvers in the northern Finnmark county that borders theSoviet Union.   In Oslo, Prime Minister Gro Harlem Bruntland told a newsconference Friday she was pleased with the alliance decision.   ``The outlined solution represents a net strengthening of theallied contribution to the defense of Norway,'' she said.   Norway's concern about the withdrawal of the Canadian force hasbeen heightened by its fear of growing superpower military strengthin the north.   Besides Turkey, Norway is the only NATO member to share a borderwith the Soviet Union.   A 13,000-man U.S. Marine amphibious brigade and a 5,000-manDutch-British landing force already are committed to reinforcingcentral Norway in wartime.   When the possibility of West German troops being included in areplacement unit for the Canadian brigade first was raised publiclylast fall, some Norwegian press reaction was negative.   Nazi troops occupied northern Norway for five years anddestroyed many villages and factories before withdrawing in May1945. Resentment is still evident in some parts of the sparselypopulated north.   The day after a foreign press report in September 1987 saidGerman combat troops could be returning to northern Norway for thefirst time, Norway's most widely read newspaper, Verdens Gang, rana photograph of a column of German soldiers above the headline,``Unwelcome in Norway.''   Government officials have never suggested they would not accepta German contingent in a new multinational reinforcement unit. InMarch, Defense Minister Johan Joergen Holst called Germanparticipation ``welcome.''</TEXT></DOC>
