Increased exports mean prosperityfor America. World Trade Week provides an excellent opportunity for Americanbusiness men and women to reaffirm their commitment to the pursuit of exportmarkets.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Trade figures for the past year indicate that American businessesare moving in the right direction. U.S. export performance during 1988was responsible for the highest growth rate this decade and the largestreduction in the trade deficit in history. During 1988, U.S. merchandiseexports grew 28 percent, reaching record levels ($320 billion). These exportsgenerated 40 percent of real GNP growth during the year and contributedto the creation of a near record number of jobs. An improved global economicclimate and measurable improvements in the quality of American goods andservices contributed to this promising export performance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The favorable market conditions that made our goods and services competitivein 1988 continue to exist in 1989, and U.S. businesses must take full advantageof this situation. American industry can benefit substantially from tradeopportunities created by recent events in the world marketplace. For example,when the historic United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement entered intoforce on January 1, 1989, it heralded the beginning of a new era in America'seconomic relations with our largest trading partner. It also created abundantopportunities for U.S. firms to reach the market offered by our 26 millionneighbors to the north.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The European Community's formation of a single market by the year1992 has the potential to provide even more trading opportunities for Americanbusiness. However, U.S. firms need to prepare for 1992 now if they areto realize greater export sales.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This Administration is committed to forging a partnership with ourNation's business community to help ensure continued economic prosperityand growth into the 1990's. Trade and U.S. competitiveness are top priorities.I am firmly committed to opening world markets to U.S. exports and promotingour free trade agenda on both multilateral and bilateral levels.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The United States led in initiating the current round of General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations, and we shall remain vigilantin our efforts to ensure that the GATT negotiations result in a strengthenedinternational trading system that creates new opportunities to expand tradeand achieve economic growth.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">We shall pursue our quest to eliminate unfair trade practices, andwe shall also use the tools provided by the Congress in the Omnibus Tradeand Competitiveness Act of 1988 to ensure an open world marketplace.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In short, this Administration will continue to do its part to ensurea strong economy into the 1990's. American business, however, must takethe lead in meeting the important challenge of increasing our competitivenessin world markets.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE BUSH, President of the United States ofAmerica, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution andlaws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 21,1989, as World Trade Week.
