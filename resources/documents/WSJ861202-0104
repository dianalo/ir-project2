Financiers said the outcome of the court's deliberations could weaken the panel and increase litigation in Britain's takeover battles. The panel would &quot;lose much of its clout&quot; if the courts could alter its rulings, said Colin Keer, a director specializing in mergers and acquisitions at Bankers Trust Co.'s London investment bank.    But Sir John Donaldson, the Court of Appeal's senior judge, said: &quot;It could do little harm if it were possible in a post-mortem case to say that the panel went wrong and to give guidance so that it would not do the same thing again.&quot;    Sir John said he and two other judges wanted more time to decide whether courts had a general power to review rulings by the panel, a self-regulatory body that hadn't been challenged in the courts before. A ruling is expected within the next week or two.    In the specific case dismissed by the court yesterday, Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., along with its client Datafin, had claimed that the panel had mistakenly ruled that Norton Opax PLC's takeover bid equivalent to $231.3 million for a rival specialist-printer, McCorquodale PLC, was fair and didn't break panel rules. Datafin is a group made up of staff at McCorquodale who had proposed a management buyout of the company.    Prudential-Bache claimed Norton Opax owed its victory in part to the purchase of some McCorquodale shares by one of Norton Opax's underwriters. The takeover panel had rejected a claim that the purchase was improper. After the court refused the application, a spokesman for Prudential-Bache and Datafin said, &quot;We won't be appealing. The Datafin offer will clearly now not succeed.&quot;    Sir Jasper Hollom, chairman of the mergers panel, declined to comment on the ruling on the Prudential-Bache case. He and other panel officials said they wanted to hear the ruling on the power of the courts to review panel decisions before they commented further. </TEXT></DOC>
