The mill is expected to cost 320 million Canadian dollars ($243.2 million) to build, adjacent to a CIP pulp mill. It will produce 230,000 metric tons of newsprint annually and is expected to begin operating in autumn 1989.    CIP is one of Canada's largest forest products concerns. Canadian Pacific is a Montreal-based transportation and industrial holding concern.    Industry sources said several U.S. publishers will take minority interests in the facility, but a CIP spokesman declined comment.    The project is one of several expansions planned by paper producers in Canada and the U.S. to meet expected growth in newsprint demand. North American newsprint producers now are operating close to full capacity and no large increases in capacity are expected before late 1989. </TEXT></DOC>
