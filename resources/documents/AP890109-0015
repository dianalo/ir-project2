(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   They were lukewarm about the Declarationof Independence and the Constitution. They opposed the War of 1812.And in presidential elections they voted against their neighbor,John Kennedy, and their governor, Michael Dukakis.   The people of this Cape Cod community have never gone with theflow and they show no signs of changing as they celebrateBarnstable's 350th anniversary this year.   ``I hate to use the cliche Yankee independence, but I suspectthere is an aspect of that,'' said Patricia Duffy, who has beenhelping compile a lengthy history of the town for use in the schoolcurriculum. ``We are cautious. We don't jump on any bandwagons.''   Barnstable lives in the shadow of its neighbors Hyannis andHyannisport, made famous by the Kennedy clan.   But Hyannis and Hyannisport are not officially incorporated astowns; they are merely two of seven villages in the town ofBarnstable, which occupies the midsection of the cape.   Barnstable is the principal municipality of Barnstable County,which encompasses all of Cape Cod. It's the state's third largestcommunity geographically and has a year-round population of about35,000 that doubles during summer.   But few outside New England know its name, although residentshope to change that with a 12-month celebration that promises muchvariety, if little peace and quiet.   Festivities include a summer rowing regatta, a colonial costumeday, a publishing party for the Cape Cod Almanac, and a Boston Popsconcert on the Hyannis town green.   The big celebration comes in early September, the actualanniversary month, and includes a visit by a delegation fromBarnstable's namesake, Barnstable, England.   The events the town will commemorate began in September 1639,when Barnstable was incorporated under a land grant from the PlimothColony.   The town history describes reaction to the American Revolution asmixed, with wealthy Tories quarreling with patriots over Britishdomination. John Crocker, whose ancestors were among the town'sfirst 45 inhabitants, puts it in physical terms: ``In the CrockerTavern (still standing) there is a gouge out of one of the beamswhere a couple of fellows had a sword fight over the issue.''   The town neither endorsed nor opposed the Declaration ofIndependence. A town meeting initially voted against the U.S.Constitution because it lacked a bill of rights.   ``The people were more wealthy down here and they were tendingtoward the status quo,'' said Robert O'Leary, a social studiesteacher.   Early thriving industries included cranberry harvesting, whichsurvives to this day, shipbuilding, lumbering, oystering andextraction of salt from the ocean. Today tourism dominates.   Because of the importance of sea trade to Barnstable, thetownspeople opposed the War of 1812 against Britain. This time therewas no give to their position: Isaiah L. Green, the area's U.S.representative, voted for the declaration of war and lost his seat,according to the school department history.   Residents remember the Kennedy era fondly. They speak of John F.Kennedy parading through town after his Democratic presidentialnomination, and of his victory speech in Hyannis after the 1960election.   But at the polls, residents favored Richard Nixon by 4,515 to2,783. They had no greater favorite-son feelings last year, whenGeorge Bush beat Dukakis 10,026 to 9,971.   Joseph Kennedy brought his family to Hyannisport in 1926 but itwasn't until his son became a national figure that the sandy beachesand sunshine of Cape Cod gained national attention and laterunrestrained development, say local historians.   ``The beauty, uniqueness and excitement of the cape portrayed bythe press put Barnstable on the map and in the world spotlight,''according to the school department narrative.   Cape Codders regret some of the growth, as they showed last fallwhen they supported a non-binding resolution in favor of a buildingmoratorium. Former U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas, a Cape Cod summerresident, said the problems on Cape Cod are as much aesthetic asenvironmental.   ``Much of what has been built on Route 28 in Hyannis isschlock,'' Tsongas said. ``If the development that took place wasarchitecturally consistent with the cape, it would not have beenhalf as offensive as it is.''</TEXT></DOC>
