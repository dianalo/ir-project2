The Panamanian government presented its case against the UnitedStates during a meeting Tuesday with the OAS delegation, sent inthe wake of the nullified election.   ``The Panamanian government took the opportunity to present aseries of documents and actions that contributed to invalidate theelections of 1989,'' presidential spokesman Jose Hernandez said.   An OAS source who refused to be named said the meeting was``difficult,'' but he did not go into detail.   Sources said the delegation was attempting to arrange a meetingwith Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Defense Forces chief and defacto ruler of Panama.   Members of the OAS delegation said they had come to facilitate asearch for solutions to Panama's political troubles.   Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara and his twovice presidential candidates were scheduled to meet with the OASdelegation. They contend they won the May 7 vote by about 3-to-1over Noriega's hand-picked candidate.   The government, however, nullified the vote, and blamedopposition fraud and U.S. interference in the election.   The OAS group met this morning with Hildebrando Nicosia, theAuthentic Panamanian Party's presidential candidate. He receivedonly a small percentage of the vote.   Nicosia said he described ``massive fraud committed by bothsides.'' He added, ``People are tired of instransigence on bothsides. The solution is for negotiations without prior conditions.''   The OAS approved a resolution last week criticizing Noriega andcalling for ``a transfer of power in the shortest possible time.''It sent a delegation consisting of the foreign ministers ofEcuador, Guatemala and Trinidad and Tobago as well as OASSecretary-General Joao Baena Soares.   Acting president Manuel Solis Palma's government said it hopedthe mission would ``establish the truth of the crisis as a conflictbetween Panama and the United States,'' and it cited U.S. sanctionsas proof of malice.   The government has proclaimed it will accept no interference ininternal Panamanian affairs and said some aspects of the OASresolution violate the OAS charter.   Panama ``expounded its points of view about the events thatbegan 24 months ago,'' said Hernandez in a statement after SolisPalma and members of his cabinet met with the OAS delegation.   The first street demonstrations against Noriega's rule began inJune of 1987. Since then, Noriega has been indicted on U.S. drugcharges, charges he says are part of a U.S. plot to renege on itscommitment to give up the Panama Canal at the end of 1999.   Members of the OAS delegation made no comment on the meetingexcept for Ecuadorean Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez, who saidonly, ``We have formed no impression.''   At the airport after arriving Tuesday, Cordovez had said theidea was to assist Panamanians in finding their own solutions andto convey Latin American concern about the situation.   Meanwhile, U.S. troops staged an amphibious landing exercise andU.S. officials said armed convoys of troops were being dispatchedover Panamanian roads with instructions not to stop.   Several times in the past Panamanian police have stopped U.S.convoys, which they have no right to do, U.S. officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
