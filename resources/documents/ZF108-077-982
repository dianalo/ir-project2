Are there long-in-the-toothdrafters who might be unhappy about switching to Macintosh CAD?andP;  What aboutyour customers, subcontractors and suppliers?andM;Most of those people will want to make changes to your drawings, send youtheir own work, swap symbols and so on.andP;  Although most drawings can be movedaround as PICT, DXF, IGES or some other standard (CADMover from KanduSoftware Corp. of Arlington, Va., is popular for making translations), it'seasier and safer for the drawing's integrity to move it in its native form.andM;What are the formats?andP;  PICT is the Macintosh standard for moving graphics,DXF (Drawing Interchange Format) is Sausalito, Calif.-based Autodesk Inc.'sAutoCAD format for moving CAD files, and IGES (initial graphics exchangespecification) is a more general CAD standard.andP;  DXF and IGES are constantlyevolving.andM;Programs that claim &quot;DXF and IGES compatibility&quot; are not always working withthe same version of the standards and they don't necessarily implement eachpart of the standard in the same way.andP;  In other words, you could save a CADfile in DXF or IGES format from one program, open it up again in anotherprogram and discover that some elements were missing or had been convertedinto similar but not identical entities.andM;Moreover, any translation slows things down and risks losing someinformation, such as dimensions or editable curves.andP;  It may be wiser to picka CAD package with which you're not completely thrilled just to be able toshare tips, ideas, drawings and general know-how with others in your workhabitat.andM;When determining who will use the CAD program, you should also considertraining (see &quot;Managing CAD training,&quot; Page 38).andP;  If you're buying forexperienced architects, for example, you may want a CAD package that usestheir language (such as Architrion II from Gimeor of Washington or ArchiCADfrom Graphisoft of South San Francisco, Calif.).andM;If you're buying for a variety of people in a company, you may want amiddle-of-the-road CAD package (such as Claris CAD; Versa-CAD/MacintoshEdition from Versacad Corp. of Huntington Beach, Calif.; or PowerDraw fromEngineered Software of Greensboro, N.C.) that sticks to standard Mac terms.andM;Drafters who have used a CAD package on another system will probably want asimilar or compatible Mac package.andP;  AutoCAD on the Mac can directly sharefiles with all other versions of AutoCAD and offers a similar set ofcommands.andP;  Engineers and architects acquain-ted with Intergraph systems willbe comfortable with MicroStation Mac from Intergraph Corp. of Huntsville,Ala., as well as with SNAP! from Sunset, S.C.-based Data Basics.andP;  Designerswho use BRAVO! from Schlumberger Technologies of Ann Arbor, Mich., on aDigital Equipment Corp.andP;  VAX should feel at home with MacBRAVO!andM;How much Mac to buy?andP;  Deciding  how much Mac you need can be difficultbecause CAD can employ every hardware resource you can afford.andP;  Calculatingthe precise positions of many on-screen points to more decimal places thancan even be shown takes a lot of processor time.andP;  Complex CAD files cansometimes grow to 1 Mbyte or more.andM;Few CAD programs need color, and even if you have color, you may findyourself turning it off to save RAM and boost drawing speed.andP;  Still, it isuseful to have colors for electronic schematics and for multiple layers orgroups of objects in a CAD drawing.andP;  Color becomes a necessity when you'recreating a rendering for presentation.andM;Is there a package specialized for your field?andP;  What you'll find in mostcomputer stores is general-purpose CAD, along the lines of Claris CAD; Vellumfrom Ashlar Inc. from Sunnyvale, Calif.; or AutoCAD.andM;But the CAD market also features programs optimized for VLSI (verylarge-scale integration), electrical, printed-circuit board, molecular designand CAM.andP;  Not only do specialized CAD packages offer better libraries ofsymbols for quick drawing by plunking complete subassemblies or standardparts onto a page, but they often sport commands you won't find in ageneral-purpose package.andP;  For example, Schlumberger's MacBRAVO!andP;  Facilities,meant for facilities managers and planners, has a tool palette optimized forwiring, plumbing and other aspects of office layout.andM;And while you certainly can use general-purpose programs to draw circuitdiagrams, there's no way they'll analyze the circuit or generate a net listfor the electronics engineer.andP;  For that, you need electronic designautomation software from such companies as Douglas Electronics of SanLeandro, Calif.; Capilano Computing Systems of Vancouver; or Vamp of LosAngeles.andM;Products like MiniCad+ from Graphsoft of Ellicott City, Md., or Origins fromDeltasoft Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., can turn out a creditable structure design,but they won't run a sun-and-shade analysis or create a walk-through, as willSpaceEdit from Abvent of Beverly Hills, Calif., or Gimeor's Architrion II.andM;If there's a specialized package for your field, you should think carefullybefore turning to a general-purpose package.andP;  At the very least, you may wantto customize a general-purpose CAD package.andM;How many dimensions are in your world?andP;  Conventional drawing and paintingprograms work on a two-dimensional, flat surface.andP;  So do many CAD programs.andO;That's fine for most CAD work.andP;  It was also the only option when working withpen and paper.andM;Since most real-world products have some three-dimensional attributes and thecomputer can comprehend 3-D models, there's a natural attraction to 3-D CAD,particularly  in areas such as architecture and CAM.andM;While not everyone needs or even thinks in three dimensions, there's a driveby some marketers to push 3-D on to increasingly more computers.andP;  But workingon a 3-D model will take substantially more processing time and horsepowerthan working on a two-dimensional view of the same model.andM;Moreover, 3-D can be more confusing at first for the designer or drafter --it's definitely tougher to grasp a 3-D model (projected as it is on atwo-dimensional screen) than a two-dimensional drawing.andP;  Nor is itparticularly easy to create a 3-D model, then work on two-dimensionalsections of that model.andP;  In many cases people use the 3-D modeling program toconceptualize and sketch a product, then turn to a 2-D drafting package tomake the actual plans and drawings.andM;So don't move to 3-D unless you truly want to see just what the final modelwill look like and you just can't get the effect from a variety oftwo-dimensional views.andM;The marketers also bandy about another term -- &quot;2.5-D.&quot; This describes CADpackages that have some ability to extend a two-dimensional model into athird dimension -- such as by extruding from the flat drawing -- but thatdon't offer full control and editing in all three spatial dimensions.andM;Finally, if you've been nervous about buying Macintosh CAD as opposed to anIBM PC CAD package, rest easy.andP;  Mac CAD now offers just about any feature oroption you'll find in PC CAD.andP;  The market may not be as mature or aspolished, but the power is there.andM;And when you add the Mac's easily learned interface and smooth integration ofprograms, you won't be surprised to learn that more PC CAD users jump ship tothe Mac than Mac users flee to the land of DOS.andM;A former engineer, Phillip Robinson is now a writer and editor for VirtualInformation of Sausalito, Calif.andM;The following options should be considered when evaluating CAD programs:andM;andgt;Full set of drawing primitives and editing commands?andP;  Some CAD packagesadvertise their hundreds of primitives (circles, arcs, lines) and commands(duplicate, mirror, distribute).andP;  Beyond the basics, it's nice to have Beziercurves, fillet and chamfer commands, and object-distribution options, but youwon't find them called into practice very often.andM;andgt;DXF (Drawing Interchange Format) and IGES (initial graphics exchangespecification) compatible? Although standards aren't bullet-proof, they'rethe best insurance you have of being able to move files between your packageand other CAD systems and programs.andM;andgt;Floating-point or integer precision?andP;  CAD programs use coordinates that arein floating-point form for greatest precision or in integer form for lessprecision but faster processing.andP;  Floating-point capability can be arequirement for finished work in aerospace, CAM or similar high-tech work,but it isn't necessary for many other tasks.andM;andgt;Color?andP;  Some color is good in any CAD program for emphasizing anddifferentiating layers or dimensions.andP;  Few CAD tasks demand more than 16colors, and even fewer require more than 256.andP;  Only the rendering of 3-Dmodels requires more color.andM;andgt;Layers?andP;  Designs can be better organized, particularly in electrical andarchitectural work, if the program offers layers within a single drawing thatcan be shown, hidden, locked and otherwise individually controlled.andP;  Sixteenlayers should be the minimum available; 256 is more than enough.andM;andgt;Views?andP;  Being able to zoom in and out to any degree, to see two windows onthe same drawing at once, and to assign names to particular pan and zoomsettings on a drawing are functions that make drawing easier.andM;andgt;Symbols?andP;  Symbols are collections of drawing primitives manipulated as aunit and assigned a single name in a stored library.andP;  Drawing is faster andmore accurate if you can use standard symbols and can create your ownsymbols.andM;andgt;Dimensioning and measurements?andP;  Any CAD package should let you assigndimension labels to lines, arcs and angles.andP;  These dimensions should be&quot;autodimensions,&quot; in that they will change their measurement valueautomatically when you change the size of the line, circle or angle.andP;  Similarcommands should automatically calculate the area, angle or length of anobject.andM;andgt;Patterns?andP;  You'll want at least 16 fill, or &quot;hatch,&quot; patterns to representmaterials or parts of a drawing, and about a half-dozen line and arrowpatterns for similar purposes.andP;  More than that is often superfluous.andM;andgt;Snapping?andP;  Any CAD package should let you &quot;snap&quot; a newly drawn line to thenearest grid intersection or previously drawn object.andP;  This makes it possibleto draw precise positions without zooming in and tediously placing each newobject.andM;andgt;Text support?andP;  You should be able to put text notes and labels on thedrawing.andP;  Sophisticated CAD packages offer both vector text (which is easilyplotted) and bit-mapped text (standard Mac stuff with fonts and styles).andM;andgt;Macros, scripts or programming language?andP;  Some CAD packages can becustomized.andP;  This programmability not only means you can tailor your systemby programming or scripting, it also means you can buy or borrow scripts andadd-ons from other users or third-party developers.andM;andgt;Spreadsheet, database or HyperCard interface?andP;  Like macros and scripts, suchdirect connections can extend the utility of a CAD program, such as offeringa bill of materials feature.andM;andgt;Tablet and plotter support?andP;  Drafters often prefer to work on a largedisplay and a tablet -- a flat surface that can hold a template with commandsand support a stylus for direct sketching.andP;  Most engineering and design tasksstill call for plotter output, which is not standard on the Mac.andP;  You can buyplotter drivers as add-ons, but direct support from the program is safer.andP;  --andO;By Phillip Robinson</TEXT></DOC>
