After a booming decade during which landlords reaped tremendous profits and New York's market was the nation's hottest, real estate values here are weakening.    Rents in the nation's biggest and most expensive market are dropping, tenants find they are in demand, and a substantial block of space is empty. And after a decade of heady growth, projects are being deferred or killed.    &quot;The market has turned,&quot; says Edward S. Gordon, a commercial real estate broker. &quot;It isn't a collapse, but there is no question that some tenants are re-evaluating their needs. In some cases they are able to bang out a better deal.&quot;    Whether the downturn is long-lived will probably depend on when financial markets recover. So far, the downtown financial district has weakened most.    John Cefaly, a broker with Cushman andamp; Wakefield, says rents in the Wall Street area have fallen by 5% to 10%. Vacancy in the area is 11.5%, up from 9.8% a year earlier, the Manhattan-based brokerage says. In the larger midtown market, vacancy has inched up only slightly, to 10.2%.    Even before Oct. 19, demand had been softening because of the city's high costs and because of low-rent competition in New Jersey. But since the stock market crash, the industry that fueled the city's good times -- financial services -- has sharply cut back its need for space.    &quot;If there have been something like 10,000 layoffs, that's a disaster given an already soft downtown market,&quot; says developer Richard Kahan.    Downtown, developer Larry Silverstein has a mammoth, two-million-square-foot building almost entirely vacant. Melvin Kaufman, who just built a glittering tower with spectacular water views at the foot of the island, has yet to announce a tenant, though he says a couple are close to biting. Olympia andamp; York Developments Ltd. has about a million square feet vacant. And E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., soon to be acquired by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., has a lot of surplus space on the market.    Space has opened up in midtown as well. J.C. Penney Co. and Mobil Corp. are leaving town; space in the buildings they occupy is on the market, and so is space in E.F. Hutton's midtown headquarters.    What's more, several skyscrapers on the West Side -- planned during the boom -- are breaking ground without a tenant. The long-delayed Times Square renovation could add a huge amount of low-rent space to midtown. And downtown, the federal government is adding a pair of buildings for federal and municipal office employees at below-market rents.    The outlook for more building is cloudy. Even before the crash, Tishman Speyer Properties Inc., one of the city's biggest developers, abandoned plans for a skyscraper on the West Side. The company is pursuing plans for condominiums in China, where it finds the market more attractive.    Plans for a massive complex overlooking Central Park were scaled back when Salomon Brothers Inc., the tenant and co-developer, withdrew. And last week, the New York Mercantile Exchange, citing the uncertain post-crash market, pulled out of a planned 65-story skyscraper, effectively killing the project.    Real estate sources say two other huge, government-sponsored projects planned for downtown are unlikely to break ground before the market improves. One is a skyscraper atop the Staten Island ferry terminal; the other is for a fifth office tower at the World Financial Center.    Real estate executives say the surplus space will eventually be rented, though on more generous terms than in the past. &quot;At the end of the day, these buildings will be filled. This is not Houston. New York is not totally dependent on one industry,&quot; says Meyer Frucher, president of Battery Park City Authority, a state agency.    He adds that local developers can withstand a downturn. Of the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans, 26 derive their wealth from New York City real estate. Thus, no one is predicting anything like the rash of foreclosures that plague the distressed Southwest.    A half-dozen or so companies have been in the market for large amounts of space since early last year. But most haven't signed, and since Oct. 19 leasing has slowed way down.    &quot;I don't feel remotely close to the panic exhibited by others,&quot; says broker Kenneth Laub. &quot;I know for a fact there is activity out there. If you're looking for a large block of space, you can take advantage of opportunity.&quot;    One potential new tenant, Henry Beinstein, executive director of the law firm of Proskauer Rose Goetz andamp; Mendelsohn, says &quot;It's a different world today than before Oct. 19. We get calls (from brokers) from left and right -- all over the place.&quot; Industry executives say Proskauer is close to leasing space in a West Side development.    Alair A. Townsend, deputy mayor for finance and economic development, says the downturn in rents isn't all bad, because &quot;companies that are thinking of abandoning us might think twice.&quot;    Industry officials say developers will have to work increasingly hard for tenants as sublease space becomes available. Generally, when companies announce layoffs, it takes time for them to consolidate departments and sublease space.    &quot;The market has changed so quickly,&quot; says Rick Rossan, an official at Silverstein Properties Inc., a developer and landlord. But it could change again, he warns.    &quot;I remember in 1975 I was giving a course at Hunter College and I said I can't believe anyone's going to build a building in the next 10 years. In 1981 the boom was on.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
