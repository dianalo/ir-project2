The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/2 pointyesterday, a gain of $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction fromits price, fell to 8.34%.</LP><TEXT>   The rally kicked off during overnight trading in London,where prices of gold futures plunged through thepsychologically important $350 level in heavy selling bySaudi Arabian investors. The London afternoon gold price wasfixed at $345.85, the lowest since July 1986. Britishgovernment bonds, called gilts, rose as much as 1 1/4 pointyesterday.   Although a mildly disappointing inflation report causedU.S. bond prices to decline during early U.S. trading, themarket reversed direction later in the day as the slide ingold hurt other precious metals.   Traders in both London and New York said that some of thecash flowing out of gold showed up later in intermediate-termU.S. and British bonds.   Brian J. Fabbri, a managing director at Midland MontaguSecurities Inc., said investors &quot;selling gold have wanted toget out of commodities and purchase some financial assets,&quot;in the U.S. and British bond markets.   Mr. Fabbri said that in recent weeks, the value of thedollar has &quot;held up extremely well&quot; while the value of theBritish pound has &quot;soared.&quot; Meanwhile, bond yields haveeased. Such trends, he said, have persuaded some foreigninvestors that they can earn high returns because they canearn profits on currency gains as well as capitalappreciation when bond prices rise.   The decline in gold spread to other commodities andprompted some economists to reduce their inflation forecasts.The Commodity Research Bureau's index of futures prices fell3.89 points to 236.44, the steepest one-day drop since May1987.   But trading yesterday was quiet, with foreign investorsaccounting for a lot of the buying.   Robert D. Sbarra, a senior vice president at CarrollMcEntee andamp; McGinley Inc., said that trading was slow becausedomestic investors were moving cautiously ahead of today'simportant consumer price index report. He said the mood inthe market remains bullish.   Bonds got off to a weak start yesterday morning, fallingas much as 1/4 point on news that the May producer priceindex rose 0.3%. That was slightly higher than had beenexpected. Bond prices started to climb again on news that theCRB index was falling.   Today, the government will release the May consumer priceindex, a broad measure of inflation. A consensus ofeconomists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report expecta 0.3% rise in last month's CPI. Excluding the food andenergy components, CPI is also seen rising 0.3%.   The government will also release data on May industrialproduction and capacity utilization and the April tradedeficit. The deluge of data due out today is expected to havea major impact on trading today.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          Municipal bonds ended unchanged to up 1/8 point in spotsas the market exhibited firm tone ahead of the week's finalround of economic data.   In municipal activity, a Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. grouprepriced $299 million of New York Metropolitan TransportationAuthority service contract revenue bonds to lower the yieldby 0.02 to 0.10 percentage point.   The issue is now priced to yield from 6.40% for transitfacilities bonds due in 1992 to 7.72% for bonds due in 2016,changed from being priced to yield from 6.50% in 1992 to7.75% in 2016.   Also, a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets group repriced $710million New York City general obligation bonds, to lower someyields. The bonds were originally priced Wednesday.   In secondary action, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's7.20% securities of 2018 ended unchanged at 98 5/8 to yield7.30%.   No large municipal bond issues are expected to be pricedtoday.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasury bonds were moderately higher yesterday. Thebenchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 10411/32 compared with 103 30/32 on Wednesday.

Thediscount rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.67%for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.91%, unchanged fromWednesday. The rate on six-month bills was 7.55% for a yieldof 7.96%, slightly lower.                                                                                                          Junk Bonds                                                                                                          The junk-bond market took a breather after Wednesday'sfrenzied pace and ended little changed.   While prices of most junk bonds or speculative-gradesecurities barely budged, high-yield bonds of Southland Corp.advanced on news that the company has proposed a revisedrestructuring plan that it says offers substantially improvedterms to bondholders and preferred stockholders.   Southland's 16.75% subordinated debentures, maturing in2002, climbed two points to finish at a bid price of 9 whilethe company's 15.75% senior subordinated notes, due in 1997,surged four points to end at 19. Offerings for the 15.75%notes shot up eight points. However, junk bond dealers saidthere was little trading in the Southland debt.   As Southland bonds advanced, Trump Taj Mahal Funding bondsslipped on a report that a number of creditors are balking ata plan to restructure the empire of real estate developerDonald Trump.   Trump Taj Mahal 14% bonds, due in 1998, slid 1 3/4 pointsto 55 1/2 on the American Stock Exchange. Also lower wereTrump Castle Funding's 13.75% bonds, due in 1997, whichskidded 1 point to 59.   Earlier this week, the Trump bonds climbed on news thatMr. Trump had reached a tentative agreement with his majorbankers that would give him time and money to restructure hiscrippled holdings.   Elsewhere, in the high-yield market, junk bonds of RJRNabisco Inc. stabilized after sprinting sharply higherWednesday.                                                                                                          Foreign Bonds                                                                                                          British government bonds ended sharply higher for thethird consecutive day, although prices slipped off sessionpeaks due to profit-taking and a dip in the U.S. Treasurymarket.   Prices rose strongly during the morning, buoyed by foreignbuying, falling gold prices and gains in the U.S. bond marketlate Wednesday.   British government bonds, called gilts, got a furtherboost from economic data suggesting further weakness in thelabor market. Britain's unemployment rate rose to aseasonally adjusted 5.7% in May from 5.6% in April, its firstmonthly rise since July 1986.   Gilts prices eased somewhat later after a disappointingreport on U.S. inflation caused prices of U.S. Treasury bondsto fall. U.S. Treasurys recovered later in the day and endedhigher.   Inflation will be the focus of the gilts market today,when the government reports the May retail-prices index.   Among benchmark issues, Britain's 11.75% bond due2003/2007 rose 1 1/4 points to 103 1/4 to yield 11.26% whilethe 12% notes due in 1995 jumped 3/4 point to 100 14/32 toyield 11.88%.

Corporate Issues                                                                                                          Yields on Chrysler Corp. debt securities rose yesterday inthe wake of actions by Moody's Investors Service Inc. andStandard andamp; Poor's Corp.   Sandamp;P said late yesterday that it lowered the senior debtratings of Chrysler Corp., Chrysler Financial Corp. andChrysler Credit Canada Ltd. The Sandamp;P rating changes come justa day after Moody's placed the auto maker's senior debt underreview for possible downgrade.   Sandamp;P also lowered certain debt ratings of Ford Motor Co.,but there was little change in Ford bonds because the ratingchange came late in the day.   In trading, yields on Chrysler's 9.60% notes, maturing in1994, climbed from 10.25% to 10.50%. Yields on other Chryslerdebt securities also rose similarly.
