The tests were carried out underconstant confining pressure and varying pore pressures in 3 stages. Kimachisandstone and Hirono sandy mudstone were used as the speciments. Undera constant confining pressure and pore pressure, endurance limits wereobserved with both of the rocks. The endurance limits decreased withthe increase in pore pressure. With the increase in the pore pressure,the number of cycles corresponding to the same stress ratio became less.The lower the stress ratio corresponding to endurance limit is, the morenumber of cycles is required to reach the endurance limit. Pore pressurepromotes dilatancy in fatigue process, and the dilatnacy due to the porepressure lowered the number of cyles to failure as well as the endurancelimit.
