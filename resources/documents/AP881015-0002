MILLS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The head of the Anti-Defamation League wantsthe Justice Department to explain why it did not reveal thatBoleslavs Maikovskis, allegedly a Nazi collaborator, fled theUnited States while awaiting deportation to the Soviet Union.   Maikovskis, 83, secretly left the United States and is believedto be in West Germany, a government source said Friday on conditionthat he not be identified. The source said he did not know whenMaikovskis left.   ``The whole thing is a little bit strange,'' ADL NationalDirector Abraham Foxman said in a telephone interview from NewYork. ``We are baffled why the secrecy around this issue.''   Maikovskis, a Latvian, had been living in Mineola, N.Y., since1951. He had been awaiting deportation since 1986 when the SupremeCourt turned down his appeal.   Maikovskis' departure came to light Friday after the ADL issueda press release urging Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to conductan ``immediate investigation into Maikovskis' whereabouts andprompt action to bring him to justice.''   Foxman said the ADL confirmed Thursday that Maikovskis wasmissing from his Mineola home and called the Justice Department toreport it.   ``They said in confidence they know that he's missing and theyknow where he is,'' Foxman said. ``So we said, `Why don't you tellthe American people?' They said they can't do that.''   Foxman then decided to go public with the only information ADLcould confirm: that Maikovskis was no longer in Mineola.   Neal Sher, director of the Justice Department's Office ofSpecial Investigations, confirmed that Maikovskis had left theUnited States, but declined to say where he had gone or how thedepartment knew this.   ``We have just learned after a massive investigation to findthis guy ... that in fact he is out of the country and in effectthe deportation order has been effectuated,'' Sher said.   He also said there was nothing further for the JusticeDepartment to investigate. ``His being brought to justice is out ofour hands,'' Sher said.   But Foxman said his group wants to know under what circumstancesMaikovskis left, when, whether he will be brought to trial, andwhether the U.S. government has any agreement with the Germans.   Sher suggested that the ADL deal with German authorities.   Maikovskis had been a chief of a Nazi-created police force inLatvia during World War II. He is accused of having ordered themass arrest of residents in the Latvian village of Audrini and thenburning the town. The 200 villagers were later killed by the Nazis.   Maikovskis was sentenced to death in absentia in the SovietUnion in 1965. Deportation proceedings against Maikovskis began inthe United States in 1976 and dragged on through several appeals.His deportation was upheld by a federal Court of Appeals in 1985and his final appeal was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1986.   Maikovskis had designated Switzerland as the country to which hewanted to be deported, but that country refused him and he faceddeportation to the Soviet Union.   In fact, OSI filed papers on Oct. 7 redesignating the SovietUnion as Maikovskis' deportation destination, Sher said, butMaikovskis apparently was already gone by then.   ``He saw the handwriting on the wall,'' Sher said, pointing tothe case of accused Nazi collaborator Karl Linnas, who was deportedlast year to the Soviet Union. Linnas, also of Long Island, diedbefore he could be tried.   Elan Steinberg, head of the World Jewish Congress, saidMaikovskis' departure was ``a tribute to OSI.''   ``The most important thing we were concerned about was gettinghim out of the country,'' Steinberg said.</TEXT></DOC>
