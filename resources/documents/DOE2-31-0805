The number of additionalcases of cancer and thyroid nodules caused by radiation exposure in Hamburgin the period of May to August 1986 among the 1.6 mil. inhabitants wasdetermined to be ca. 6 to 18, out of which 0.3 to 1.2 cases will be foundin the age group of young children. However, radiation exposure mustbe expected long-term to cause a higher cancer rate by a factor of 10than those calculated, i.e. more than 100 cancer cases. Resulting geneticinjuries will not be visible until after generations and may total amultiple of the cancer cases. (orig./HSCH).</TEXT></DOC>
