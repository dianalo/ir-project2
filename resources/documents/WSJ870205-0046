Sentencing is set for March 20.    The 24-year-old former broker with E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. was arrested last February and was indicted in April on 20 counts of mail fraud and conspiracy. In May, he was sued by his great-uncle, Frank Gory of Hallandale, for allegedly causing Mr. Gory heavy losses in the stock market by making hundreds of unauthorized trades in his account. Assistant U.S. Attorney Neil Karadbil said Mr. Roberts's actions cost Mr. Gory at least $8 million.    As previously reported, Mr. Roberts won a reputation as a superstar broker and bought a $1.5 million mansion in Boca Raton and a collection of luxury automobiles. </TEXT></DOC>
