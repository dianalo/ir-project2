In a report released yesterday, the investigative arm ofCongress said that continued reliance on the physicaltransfer of stock certificates hinders efforts to make thesecurities markets less risky and more efficient. And itcould interfere with plans to shorten the period forsettlement of U.S. stock trades to three days from five, theGAO said.</LP><TEXT>   The SEC has said it wants to move over the next few yearsto a three-day settlement system. But it has assuredinvestors that it won't order the elimination of stockcertificates. Some Wall Street houses, meanwhile, are takingmatters into their own hands; Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. last summerbegan charging $15 for shareholders who request stockcertificates when they buy a stock.   In its report, the GAO also said that failure to move to abook-entry system for stock transactions could &quot;hamper thestrength of our markets in the future as foreign markets moveto offer more efficient settlement services to internationalinvestors.&quot;   The agency said the securities industry has made progressin automating securities transfers for institutional trades,but that many retail trades still involve the transfer ofstock certificates.   Among retail investors, however, there are concerns thatmoving to a book-entry system could alienate investors whowant to keep their stock certificates, the GAO said. Inaddition, some state laws authorize shareholders to obtainstock certificates as records of their ownership incorporations, the GAO said.   The GAO recommended that the SEC move to break theimpasse, rather than rely on the industry to resolve theissue. It also advised the SEC to consider setting atimetable for the industry to develop a plan to furtherautomate securities transfers and address industry concernsassociated with retail investors.</TEXT></DOC>
