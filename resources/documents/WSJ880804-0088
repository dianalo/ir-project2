Nine months into his second term, Prime Minister Turgut Ozal stares at an unsettling economic scene: Inflation exceeds 50% a year, and a flight from the Turkish lira earlier this year is slowing his economic-liberalization program.    Massive public spending that helped propel his Motherland Party to victory in November has saddled Turkey with so much foreign debt -- $38.3 billion at the end of 1987 -- that Mr. Ozal must impose austerity that is certain to make life tougher for Turks and threaten his own support. &quot;In the last couple of years, we grew too rapidly,&quot; says Ali Tigrel, undersecretary at Turkey's state planning organization. &quot;Now we have come to the point where we need some real moderation. I am going to be extremely tough on everybody this year.&quot;    Adds a Western economist: &quot;Ozal is going to have to get realistic real fast and take tough measures. Either he does it, or the IMF will do it for him.&quot; The International Monetary Fund must approve austerity measures before it will help restructure a country's foreign debts.    Understandably, Mr. Ozal's popularity has waned in recent months, though an assassination attempt against him in June evoked a sympathetic reaction that revived his standing. His much-publicized pilgrimage to Mecca last month also reassured many who worried that he is forsaking Islam in his drive to Westernize.    Mr. Ozal's first election, in 1983, marked the end of the third military regime to govern Turkey in three decades. Since then the prime minister, once regarded only as a technocrat, has been relentless in pushing his country Westward. Turkey's application last year for full membership in the European Community was Mr. Ozal's declaration that his country is fit -- democratically and economically -- to take its place in the West.    As evidence of Turkey's growing democracy, he can point to several smooth elections, the lifting of bans that prohibited certain politicians from public life and an improving human-rights record. But it is Turkey's economic advance on which the 60-year-old Mr. Ozal, an electrical engineer, built his political career.    His first important government post came in 1967 under Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel. In 1971, a month after the army forced Mr. Demirel's resignation, Mr. Ozal left to work for the World Bank. When the army let Mr. Demirel form a minority government in 1979, Mr. Ozal took over the task of economic reform.    &quot;Turkey was going down the drain,&quot; he recalls. &quot;Inflation was over 100%, we couldn't pay our debt, there were shortages of everything. There was anarchy; in 1980, an average of 20 people a day were killed on the streets.&quot;    Mr. Ozal launched a plan to reschedule Turkey's debt and open its economy, abolishing most price controls. Inflation began to recede and shortages abated, but anarchy continued. Parliament issued a no-confidence vote for Mr. Demirel's minority government, and again in 1980 the army stepped in. A 7 a.m. phone call summoned Mr. Ozal to army headquarters where he agreed to continue his economic work if he was named deputy prime minister.    But opposition to his proposals neared the breaking point when he threatened to dismantle the system protecting Turkish companies from import competition. And banks resisted his moves toward free-market interest rates. By mid-1982, bankruptcies were increasing. The military council was nervous. Mr. Ozal resigned.    Retreating with his family to Turkey's Anatolia region, he planned his return as prime minister in anticipation of the day the military would again permit political parties. At year end, he visited the U.S., where heart specialists warned that his weight, then 250 pounds, was aggravating a heart condition.    When Mr. Ozal returned to Turkey, 60 pounds lighter, his request to form a new party was granted, he thinks, &quot;only because they considered I wouldn't get more than 10% of the vote.&quot; The Motherland Party was formed May 20, 1983, barely passing the registration requirement that it have 30 members. Mr. Ozal describes the party as &quot;conservative and nationalistic,&quot; advocating a free market and a social-justice system combining Western tradition with Islamic values.    Thanks largely to Mr. Ozal's skill on television, then new to Turkey, his Motherland Party won 212 of 292 parliamentary seats.    Mr. Ozal's first term was marked by a massive push for a more open economy. He abolished foreign-exchange controls, removed most import quotas and lowered customs duties. Revenue from the duties on cars, cigarettes and other items once smuggled into Turkey went to housing and social programs. Tax rebates were enacted to encourage exports, which grew to $13.8 billion last year from $5.7 billion in 1983.    Turkey was on the move. In 1984, fewer than half of Turkey's villages had electricity or phones; by 1987, only a few were without. A huge campaign began to build highways, roads and more than 75 dams.    The huge cost of all of that building and export promotion caused a surge in foreign-exchange deposits, while the U.S. dollar's plunge in value pumped short-term debt to $8.7 billion. Mr. Ozal says he will cool the economy this year, aiming to bring growth down to about 5% from last year's 7.3% and 8.3% in 1986. No building projects will be started this year, he promises.    &quot;There is no lack of knowledge or understanding by Ozal or his top non-political men of what must be done,&quot; says one economist. &quot;The question is whether they have the political will.&quot;    Adds Rusdu Saracoglu, chairman of Turkey's central bank: &quot;The government went a bit overboard in the second half of 1986 and in 1987 because of elections.&quot; The problem was aggravated, he says, by the international financial community's willingness to finance only building projects and by an &quot;oligopolistic banking system&quot; that failed to raise interest rates to generate demand for the Turkish lira. February's tightening of monetary policy, Mr. Saracoglu says, now must be followed by fiscal tightening.    &quot;Turkey,&quot; says a Westerner who worked on South American debt problems, &quot;is light years ahead of the Latins in terms of confronting its problems and taking steps to fix them. The ability and competence are there; now we will see about the political will.&quot;    At the state planning organization, Mr. Tigrel is part of a new four-member committee whose approval is necessary before any public agency can borrow abroad. &quot;For the next two years, we will have to start without any compromises for anybody,&quot; he says.    That won't be easy, given unemployment and inflation levels. &quot;Certainly,&quot; says Mr. Ozal, &quot;I will look at the advice made by the bureaucrats. But I must also listen to the people.&quot;    Meanwhile, steep price increases are providing ammunition for Mr. Ozal's political opponents. &quot;The majority of people are getting poorer,&quot; says Turker Alkan of the Social Democrat Populist Party. &quot;Since 1980, the real income of people bound by wages and civil service has declined almost 50%.&quot;    With his huge parliamentary majority, Mr. Ozal would seem to have little to worry about in terms of tightening Turkey's belt. But he won that majority with only 36% of the popular vote, and he and his young Western-educated advisers must be wary of various factions as well as the army's tendency to step into government. &quot;The military and civilian bureaucracy were in control here for many years,&quot; says a Turkish businessman. &quot;The prime minister and his young princes must be very careful not to frighten the mule carrying the china.&quot;    Mehmet Keciciler, chief deputy leader of Mr. Ozal's Motherland Party and, as leader of the party's Islamic wing, a potential rival of the prime minister, issues a similar warning. &quot;If by the end of five years we don't have inflation totally under control,&quot; he says, &quot;no power in the world can bring us back.&quot;    --- -    Turkey: 1987 Economic Signposts   Population            51.7 million   Exports              $13.80 billion   Imports              $15.20 billion   Nominal GDP          $58.22 billion   External Debt        $38.30 billion   Interest Payments   as % of Exports       17.4%    Source: Institute of International Finance, Washington</TEXT></DOC>
