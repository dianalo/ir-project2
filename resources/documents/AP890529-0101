Speaker Jim Wright's problems with alleged violations of Houseethics rules and the surprise weekend resignation of Rep. TonyCoelho, No. 3 in the leadership, have cast a cloud not only overtheir own futures but also Congress itself.   Nonetheless, its legislative work goes on _ even in aholiday-shortened week in which the speaker could resign and asuccessor be chosen both to him and Coelho.   The Senate is scheduled to take up a domestic spending billThursday that would devote $822 million more this year atop the$5.3 billion already designated for anti-drug initiatives.   The bill was approved by the House last week despite a vow byadministration officials to recommend that Bush veto it on groundsit deepens the federal deficit and that anti-drug spending alreadyhas been increased by 39 percent since last year.   The legislation also includes $1.2 billion for raising veterans'benefits and improving their health programs, $893 million tostudent college loans, $423 million for foster care aid and $88million for public housing.   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the SenateAppropriations Committee, also wants to add $6.6 million to thebill to subsidize commercial airline service to rural areas and $75million to rebuild a radio telescope in his state that collapsedlast year.   The House, meanwhile, may take up the agreement between Bush andJapan allowing Japanese firms access to U.S. technology for thedevelopment of their own version of General Dynamics Corp.'s F-16fighter jet.   The Senate approved the deal two weeks ago, but only by a narrow52-47 margin and only after amending it to prohibit Japan fromusing advanced U.S. jet engine technology to foster their ownaerospace industry.   The House Foreign Affairs Committee last week softened therestrictions to set up a mechanism for Congress to disapprove anysuch technology transfers after Secretary of State James A. BakerIII was quoted as saying Bush would veto any bill that put limitson the terms he can negotiate with Japan.   The agreement was tentatively scheduled for House action onThursday. If approved, differences with the Senate version wouldhave to be ironed out by negotiators for both bodies.   Critics, led by Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., have complained thatJapan should be buying export versions of the F-16 and reducing its$50 billion trade deficit with the United States instead ofinsisting of co-developing their own version using U.S. technology.   On Wednesday, the House is scheduled to act on a bill to make 37individuals, partnerships and companies start developing shale oilmining claims on 246,366 acres of federal land in Colorado, Utahand Wyoming or lose them.   Most of the 1,846 claims were staked out between 1915 and 1918.While never developed, the claims have precluded use of the landfor other purposes such as recreation or grazing.   The bill by Rep. Nick Joe Rahall, D-W.Va., would require theholders to spend $5,000 a year on each claim in a ``diligenteffort'' to get them in full production between 2015 and 2018 orforfeit them.   Since shale oil is not viewed as an economically viable energysource in today's market, the real purpose is to prevent the landfrom being turned over to private interests for as little as $2.50an acre.   Rahall and other supporters have said they want to avoid arepeat of a 1986 settlement with the Interior Department in whichmining claim holders exercised lease rights on 82,000 acres for$2.50 each only to sell the rights later to Shell Oil Co. andothers for up to $2,000 an acre.   The Senate on Wednesday will consider reauthorizing for anotherfive years the Strategic Petroleum Reserve intended to serve as anenergy life jacket in the event of another oil embargo or otherworldwide shortage.   The reserve, begun two years after the 1973 Arab oil embargo,now has 570 million barrels of oil _ slightly less than a 90-daysupply _ stored in salt caves in Texas and Louisiana.   With U.S. oil imports rising 50 percent in the last three years,the legislation would raise the reserve's ceiling from 750 millionbarrels to 1 billion barrels early in the next century.   The bill also gives the president greater authority to divertoil for the reserve to refineries in an effort to suppress priceshocks such as the upward spiral two months ago after the ExxonValdez tanker spill in Alaska.   Also before the Senate Wednesday is a measure by Sen. PaulSimon, D-Ill., to encourage television networks, local stations andcable systems to develop guidelines on depicting violence and druguse.   Technically, Simon's bill only exempts the industry fromantitrust claims that might result from joint efforts to developthe guidelines. But the legislation is clearly aimed at reducingthe level of violence on TV.   Network executives haven't embraced the measure, but they alsohaven't tried to stop. Vehement opposition has been voiced by theAmerican Liberties Union, which has called it a step towardcensorship and a threat to First Amendment rights of free speechunder the Constitution.</TEXT></DOC>
