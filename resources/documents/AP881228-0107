One of the solutions to the problem is the building anddeployment of 300 to 500 of the so-called Midgetman single-warheadatomic weapons, said the report by the Center for Strategic andInternational Studies.   The year-long study was the latest round in what is expected tobe a major national security battle within the administration ofPresident-elect Bush over the future of U.S. nuclear forces.   The United States and the Soviets are negotiating at theStrategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) for a 50 percent cut in thelong-range atomic arsenals of each country.   At the same time those talks are going ahead, the Pentagon facesserious budget problems because defense spending is likely to befrozen for the foreseeable future, despite plans by each of theservices to buy more weapons, the study said.   The study was produced by a leading conservative think-tank.Among participants in the report were Thomas Moorer, former chairmanof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Joseph Nye and Walter Slocombe,two senior State Department officials from the Carter administration.   Any START treaty is likely to require the reduction of largenumbers of U.S. atomic weapons, the study noted.   It warned that ``START, without a modernization program toimprove the survivability and effectiveness of remaining U.S.forces, could be deleterious to U.S. deterrent policy.''   The report suggested building a post-START arsenal which includes:   _300 to 500 of the Midgetman weapons, each of which would bedeployed in a mobile mode in its own silo.   _18 to 20 Trident missile-firing submarines, a Trident forcegenerally smaller than planned by the Navy.   _Deployment of 100 stealth B-2 bombers by the end of the century.The Air Force is now planning to buy 132 of the radar-evading planesat an estimated cost of $68 billion. The plane, which was unveiledto the public a month ago, would be in addition to the 100 B-1bombers already built.   The study proposed the three classes of weapons as the newmembers of the U.S. nuclear triad, which includes land- andsea-based missiles and manned bombers.   The biggest fight is likely over the land-based missiles, whichare intended to replace the aging force of Minuteman weapons.   Congress has already approved construction of 50 MX weapons, tobe placed in fixed silos, but the Reagan administration is pushingfor 50 more of the 10-warhead weapons for placement aboard trains.Eventually, all 100 MX weapons would be moved to the trains,according to administration officials.   Congressional Democrats have backed the single-warhead Midgetman,and the current Pentagon budget bill directs Bush to make a decisionby March 31 about whether to continue spending research money forboth the rail-based MX and the Midgetman.   Building up to 500 Midgetman weapons would cost an estimated $30billion, while the rail-based MX weapon would cost an estimated $13billion, the study noted.</TEXT></DOC>
