Police used clubs and shields on the crowd of about 5,000 whogathered outside the provincial government headquarters in Kwangju,170 miles southwest of Seoul.   Some protesters were trampled as people tried to force their waypast police. Injuries were seen during the violent confrontationbut police said they had no figures.   Radical students pelted police with rocks and bricks as fightingsurged up and down Kwangju's main street. Hundreds of onlookersjeered and yelled insults as police tried to clear the street bymarching in lines with interlocked shields.   ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' protesters chanted.``Drive out the Yankees!''   A larger but less-violent protest was held Saturday, and a marchby about 1,000 people earlier on Sunday was peaceful.   The marches were called by radical students to protest the deathof Lee Chul-kyu, whose body was found Wednesday in a reservoir nearKwangju.   Authorities fear Lee's death will keep heightening tensions inKwangju, which marks the anniversary this week of the May 18, 1980,uprising in which at least 192 people were killed. Many studentsblame President Roh Tae-woo, a former military general, for thebloody suppression of the uprising.   All police in Kwangju and nearby areas were put on special alert.   Dissidents claim Lee, who was being sought by police foranti-government activities, was tortured to death by authorities.Police said an autopsy last week showed no signs of torture andthat pathology tests Sunday confirmed the existence of plankton inhis body, indicating death by drowning.   To ensure the credibility of the tests, authorities allowed twoindependent medical experts and opposition lawmakers to take partin or witness the process.   Radical student leaders told reporters they would appeal toAmnesty International, the London-based human rights group, toconduct an independent investigation if the official Korean probeconcluded police were blameless.   Kim Hyung-jang, one of the student leaders, claimed governmentpathologists were helping cover up police involvement. ``We cannottrust them,'' he told the news conference.   During the march, dissidents called for the overthrow of Roh anddemanded the expulsion of the 43,000 U.S. troops based in SouthKorea.   The dissidents claim Roh and the United States are trying toimpose authoritarian rule on the country.   Radical students and dissidents, estimated by governmentofficials at 10,000, are a well-organized minority in South Korea's42 million population. But they lack public support because oftheir violent tactics and extreme views.</TEXT></DOC>
