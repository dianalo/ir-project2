U.S. District Judge Sherman Finesilver in Denver signedthe agreement in principle to settle the Federal DepositInsurance Corp.'s $200 million suit against the officials offailed Silverado Banking, Savings andamp; Loan Association. Mr.Bush, the president's son, was an outside director ofSilverado from 1985 to 1988.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Settlement discussions have been protracted and intense,and on numerous occasions, have been around the clock,&quot; JudgeFinesilver said in his two-page order. He commended bothsides for reaching a settlement of &quot;difficult and novel legalissues in a complex and changing legal environment.&quot; The twosides are to submit more-specific documents tomorrow and nextmonth, and hope to complete the settlement in mid-June.   James Nesland, an attorney for Mr. Bush, said his clientwas relieved that the matter was substantially over. &quot;I thinkit's fair, but nobody is happy about it,&quot; he said. &quot;I thinkthe FDIC should be very satisfied with the result of thissettlement.&quot;   Mr. Nesland said Mr. Bush, who continues to live inDenver, recently left his position at Apex Energy and hasbeen interviewing for other jobs. Mr. Bush hasn't decidedwhether to appeal a separate government action against him,in which the Office of Thrift Supervision issued an orderbarring him from violating bank or thrift regulations if heever again serves on the board of a financial institution.   In his order, Judge Finesilver said an October 1991 trialdate would remain in force, in case the settlement fallsapart.   An FDIC spokesman said that to settle the charges, thedefendants will pay $26.5 million to the FDIC. Officers anddirectors typically have insurance covering any liability fortheir actions at the thrift, but Mr. Nesland declined tocomment on the source of these repayments.   The Silverado officers and directors also will assign tothe FDIC their claims to a separate $23 millionexecutive-indemnity fund, which had been established bySilverado before it was seized by the government in November1988.   The Silverado settlement is among the largest ever for theFDIC. Directors and officers of Eureka Federal Savings andamp; LoanAssociation of San Carlos, Calif., settled a similar case for$68 million last year.   The presence of Mr. Bush on the Silverado board was justone reason that the thrift was the subject of intense federalscrutiny, including a lengthy investigation by the HouseBanking Committee last year. Silverado's executive rosterincluded Michael Wise, a hefty political contributor to bothparties and a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ofTopeka, which regulated the thrift. Mr. Wise, one of thedefendants in the case, couldn't be reached for commentyesterday. Silverado was also notable for the size of thefailure, representing roughly $1 billion of the $200 billionSandamp;L cleanup costs.   The original 61-page complaint against the officialsalleged, among other things, that the Silverado officialspaid themselves excessive salaries, including $1.3 million toMr. Wise in 1986, and diverted millions of dollars of thriftfunds for their personal use. It also alleged that the thriftpadded its capital by requiring borrowers to purchase acertain class of Silverado stock. Silverado also used phonyappraisals to prop up illegal land investments, according tothe complaint.   Regulators charged that Mr. Bush, an outside director whodidn't receive a regular salary, improperly approved a loanto a business partner, and that he didn't disclose hisbusiness relationship with another large Silverado borrower.   Meanwhile, an FDIC official said a civil case against theaccounting firm Coopers andamp; Lybrand, in connection with its1987 audit of Silverado, is still pending final settlement.Officials expect a $20 million settlement.</TEXT></DOC>
