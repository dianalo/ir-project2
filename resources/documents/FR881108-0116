Detailed information about the background and experience of the principalinvestigator(s) (including references to publications), the facilitiesand experience of the proposer, and the cost-sharing arrangements, if any.(While cost sharing is encouraged, it is not required nor is it to be consideredas a criterion in the evaluation and selection process.)4. A budget with supporting justification sufficient to evaluate the costsof the proposed project (ER budget forms 4620.1 and 4620.1A should be used.)5. A description of the proposer's management capability (including costmanagement techniques), experience and past performance, and subcontractingpractices.6. The proposal face page must be signed by the individual who is applyingand by an individual who is authorized to act for the proposing organizationand to commit the proposer to comply with the terms and conditions of thecontract, if awarded.B. Renewal ProposalsProposals for a renewal award must be submitted in an original and sevencopies to the DOE contracting officer at the DOE Office administering thecurrent contract.C. Other Information for ProposersDOE is under no obligation to pay for any costs associated with the preparationor submission of proposals.DOE reserves the right to fund, in whole or in part, any, all or none ofthe proposals submitted.DOE is not required to return to the proposer a proposal which is not selectedor funded.V. Proposal Evaluation and SelectionA. Proposals shall be evaluated for funding generally within 6 months but,in any event, no later than 12 months from the date of receipt by DOE.After DOE has held a proposal for 6 months, the proposer may, in responseto DOE's request, be required to revalidate the terms of the original proposal.DOE staff shall perform an initial evaluation of all proposals to ensurethat the information required by this Research Opportunity Announcementis provided, that the proposed effort is technically sound and feasible,and that the effort is consistent with program funding priorities.For proposals which pass the initial evaluation, DOE shall objectivelyevaluate each proposal received using scientific or peer review againstthe criteria set forth below. OER may supplement internal DOE review resourceswith peer review, in addition to Federal evaluation, with the objectiveof having the technical/scientific evaluation conducted by the most qualifiedindividuals available. Mail reviews are most commonly used to obtain peerreview comments. Large dollar value proposals, technically complex/multidisciplinaryproposals or those proposals submitted in a scientific field for whichreview committees are currently available to ER will generally be reviewedby peer committees, if determined to be appropriate by the program office.DOE shall select evaluators on the basis of their professional qualificationsand expertise in the field of research. Evaluators shall be required tocomply with all applicable DOE rules or directives concerning the use ofoutside evaluators.DOE shall evaluate new and renewal proposals based on the following criteriawhich are listed in descending order of importance:(1) The scientific and technical merit of the research;(2) The appropriateness of the proposed method or approach;(3) Competency of research personnel and adequacy of proposed resources;and(4) Reasonableness and appropriateness of the proposed budget.B. In addition to the evaluation criteria set forth in paragraph A, DOEshall consider the proposer's technical performance under the existingcontract during the evaluation of a renewal proposalC. Proposals will be selected for award based upon the findings of thetechnical evaluations, the importance and relevance of the proposed researchto OER's mission, and fund availability. Cost reasonableness and realismwill also be considered to the extent appropriate. After the selectionof a proposal for funding, DOE may, if necessary, enter into negotiationswith a proposer prior to the award of a contract. Such negotiations arenot a commitment that DOE will make an award. Resultant contracts willbe subject to the applicable portions of the Federal Acquisition and Departmentof Energy Acquisition Regulations.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC on October 17, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">D.D.
