Farmers became the first major interest group to object to thegovernment economic program that was introduced Sunday. The planaims to transform Poland into a market economy after 45 years ofCommunist economics and calls for sharp cuts in state spending andsubsidies to balance the budget and cure Poland's 900 percentinflation.   But while the discussion on farm policy was sharp, thegovernment's economic reform program as a whole was not consideredto be in serious trouble.   Agriculture Minister Czeslaw Janicki told the Sejm, the lowerhouse of Parliament, that the government would create an agency tointervene in the market if farm prices fall too low, but that it isessential to move away from government-mandated prices.   Janicki also promised to curb monopoly food processors to whomfarmers sell, and pledged to try to increase the flow of farmmachinery, fertilizer and other agriculture inputs to thecountryside.   The reassurances did not satisfy Parliament members from ruralareas who argued for guaranteed prices and more direct stateinvestment in farming.   Farmers in food-poor Poland are angry that the government wantsto abandon guaranteed minimum prices for their produce, arguingthat their costs are rising and they need to be assured ofprofitability.   About 75 percent of Poland's farming is in private hands, mainlyon small holdings of only a few acres. Productivity per acre isabout half that of Western Europe.   In the past, the government fixed prices at what it determinedwas a profitable level, often one that rewarded even inefficientfarmers. Lat year, the government moved toward a system in whichprices are to be negotiated freely between farmers and purchasers.   But farmers have complained that the buyers _ mainly nationwideCommunist Party-dominated food and processing cooperatives _ aremonopolies that dictate unfavorable prices.   They also complaim that city dwellers unfairly blame them for1,000 percent price increases in recent months, and that most ofthe money has been pocketed by the intermediaries.   Ryszard Smolarek, a Communist deputy, argued for maintainingminimum guaranteed prices at least until July.   ``Agriculture cannot be dumped into the deep water,'' he said.``Farmers' incomes are going to be left without any protection.''   ``Opinions are getting more and more radical in thecountryside,'' Deputy Jacek Szymaderski said, arguing for greatergovernment investment in agricultural development.   The government did not ``take into consideration the specificnature of agriculture,'' said Deputy Jozef Zych, a member of thePeasant Party.   Over the weekend, Jozef Slisz, the head of the independentfarmers union Rural Solidarity, was ousted at the union's congressand replaced by Gabriel Janowski, a farmer-senator who wasperceived as more willing to criticize the government.   ``Our farmer knows a lot and he could do a lot, but hiscapabilitiies and his possibilities are limited by a lack ofmeans,'' Janicki told the chamber.   ``The state of agriculture, like the whole economy, is a resultof the piling up of problems in the system over several decades,''he said.   On the issue of supporting minimal prices of agriculturalproducts, Janicki said it would be done through intervention in themarket by a new Agency for Agricultural Market Affairs.   ``This agency will be equipped with essential means andauthority which will allow it to better stabilize the foodmarket,'' he said. It will make ``intervention purchases'' at thelocal level if necessary to support set price levels for grains,meat and milk, he said.   The governent will use new anti-monopoly legislation to break upmonopolies in agricultural services and food processing, he said.   ``As long as there are monopolies in procurement of agriculturalproducts there will be problems'' in creating a free market,Janicki said.   The Sejm is to meet again Tuesday and possibly Wednesday.   After Sunday's meeting, a 43-member commission of deputies wasformed to review the whole package. Charied by Solidarity DeputyAndrzej Zawislak, it is to speed review of the package to meet aJan. 1 government deadline.   Asked whether the more than a dozen bills and resolutions couldbe approved, Zawislak said, ``There is a chance, because theextreme situation causes an explosion of social energy that cancarry out great changes.''   The government has acknowledged the program will leadtemporarily to unemployment and lowered living standards, but saysit is necessary to choke off inflation and make the economyefficient.   The plan includes balancing the deficit-ridden state budgetthrough strict austerity; cutting off most state subsidies; freeingprices; limiting wage increases; turning the zloty into aconvertible currency; attacking monopolies; reforming the bankingand tax systems; establishing a social safety net for the poor andjobless; and selling off state industries to the private sector.</TEXT></DOC>
