Barrett   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>05/21/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B4</SO><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- Attorney General Dick Thornburgh failed todisclose that his top personal aide, Robert Ross, had showndeception on part of a lie-detector test during acontroversial internal Justice Department investigation, asenior department official said.   Mr. Ross's flunking part of the lie-detector test was &quot;oneconsideration&quot; in his decision, announced last Monday, toresign from the department, according to the senior official.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Thornburgh has known since late last fall that Mr.Ross and another personal aide, David Runkel, had showndeception on lie-detector tests but chose not to disclose thematter &quot;because something like that can ruin careers,&quot; saidthe senior official, who was designated by the attorneygeneral's office yesterday to answer press questions on theissue. Mr. Runkel has repeatedly refused to comment.   Mr. Ross couldn't be reached for comment. Previously, heand other Justice Department officials have said his imminentdeparture and Mr. Runkel's reassignment to less prominentduties were part of a personnel shake-up having nothing to dowith the internal Justice Department investigation.   Interviewed yesterday on ABC's &quot;This Week with DavidBrinkley,&quot; Mr. Thornburgh denied a report in the Los AngelesTimes that he &quot;helped conceal&quot; Mr. Ross's deception toprotect his longtime personal assistant.   The lie-detector tests were administered as part of adepartmentwide criminal probe into who had disclosed theexistence of an investigation involving the office of Rep.William Gray (D., Pa.). The disclosure of the Grayinvestigation last May prompted accusations that it was aRepublican effort to undermine the congressman's ultimatelysuccessful race to become the No. 3 official in the HouseDemocratic leadership.   Mr. Thornburgh in December announced that the internaldepartment review, conducted by Federal Bureau ofInvestigation agents and Criminal Division prosecutors,produced &quot;insufficient evidence&quot; for a criminal prosecutionor disciplinary action against current Justice Departmentemployees.   The senior department official who spoke yesterday saidthat the deception indicated by the lie-detector tests ofMessrs. Ross and Runkel produced &quot;leads&quot; but that those leadsyield &quot;no evidence&quot; that either man was the source of theGray disclosure.   Mr. Thornburgh has conceded that Mr. Runkel effectivelyconfirmed the disclosure about Mr. Gray to the CBS televisionreporter who broadcast the first report on the matter.   The senior department official said that at least some ofthe questions put to Mr. Ross as part of the lie-detectortest &quot;were relevant&quot; directly to the Gray disclosure, asopposed to being control questions on other matters. Theattorney general and his aides &quot;were aware there would besome embarrassment&quot; if it became known that Messrs. Ross andRunkel had shown deception, the senior official said.   Asked directly why Mr. Thornburgh didn't disclose thelie-detector test results at the same time that he exoneratedhis aides, the senior official responded: &quot;That assumes anobligation to disclose {the test results}. . . . That'sdebatable.&quot;   In a separate review of the entire matter, the JusticeDepartment's solicitor general, Kenneth Starr, concluded thatMr. Thornburgh had acted appropriately within his discretion.   Subsequently, Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden ofDelaware, a Democratic spokesman on the Gray affair, said hewas satisfied that &quot;any further investigation of this matterwould not provide any further information and therefore isnot warranted.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
