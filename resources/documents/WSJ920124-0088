The Westborough, Mass., computer maker said net fell to $4million, or 12 cents a share, from $12.4 million, or 41 centsa share, a year earlier.</LP><TEXT>   Revenue fell 6% to $294.8 million from $311.7 million,reflecting in part the sale of the Nippon Data Generalsubsidiary, which accounted for $16 million of the decline.   Data General shares, one of the New York Stock Exchange'sstrongest performers last year, lost 24% of their value onheavy volume yesterday to close at $12.125, down $3.875, incomposite trading.   The quarterly profit was the fifth in a row for DataGeneral, after more than five years of losses. But theresults fell far short of most analysts' estimates, whichranged from 40 cents to 50 cents a share.   Ronald L. Skates, president and chief executive officer,attributed the decline to the weak economy and toprice-cutting and warned that disappointing results mightcontinue. &quot;Industrywide pricing pressures, which had asignificant impact on last quarter's results, will not abatefor some time.&quot;   He added that while he believes Data General's strategy iscorrect, &quot;we remain very cautious about the remainder of1992.&quot;   Data General said its new Aviion computer line continuedto grow sharply during the quarter. But analysts questionedwhether its growth was proving strong enough to offset thedecline in the much larger MV line of computers.   Barry Bosak, of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.,estimated the decline of the MV line at 20%. &quot;Aviion isn'tenough yet to carry the company. They need the MV to roundout results,&quot; he said.   At the same time, price-cutting has put profit marginsunder severe pressure, said Barry F. Willman of Sanford C.Bernstein andamp; Co. And he noted that despite the recent progressData General has made, it isn't immune to the weak salesafflicting larger computer makers.   Despite the growth rate of 50% in the Aviion line, &quot;asustained turnaround in this environment is going to be verydifficult,&quot; he said.   Both analysts said they expected to see further expensecuts and possibly new work force reductions by Data General,which has already slashed more than half its payroll from apeak of 17,700 in 1985. A spokesman said that &quot;the headcountwill be reduced over time but no major layoffs are planned.&quot;He said employment now stands at 8,100.</TEXT></DOC>
