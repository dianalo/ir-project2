A strike date wasn't set, and negotiations between the union and the company are set to resume on Monday. The 6,000 employees work at paper mills in Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland.    The union broke off talks with Toronto-based Abitibi-Price earlier this month because of what it termed Abitibi's &quot;insistence on concession bargaining&quot; and lack of progress on pension improvements and job security.    As previously reported, the union is seeking a 7.1% wage increase in the first year and 8% in the second year of a two-year contract. The current average wage is $14.50 (Canadian) an hour.    The union earlier selected Abitibi-Price as the target company in contract talks involving 30,000 unionized paper workers in eastern Canada. Contracts in the industry expired April 30, but the workers are continuing to do their jobs under the old agreement. </TEXT></DOC>
