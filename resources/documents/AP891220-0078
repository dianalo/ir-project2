The governmentsays it doesn't have to to deport them.   While illegal immigrants often don't know their rights andprefer to go home rather than fight to stay, the Boston cases arebeing regarded as a test of aliens' rights.   The Immigration and Naturalization Service ``is saying thegovernment doesn't have to come up with any evidence at all,'' saidattorney Susan Akram, who is orchestrating the aliens' defense.``The INS has never brought a shred of evidence.''   ``It's a test of what the government burden is,'' said Akram,head of the Political Asylum Immigration Representation Project.``Can the government haul anybody in off the streets and deportthem if they refuse to answer questions based on theirconstitutional right not to do so? This is ridiculous.''   The defendants were among 83 Salvadoran, Mexican, Brazilian andCuban stablehands rounded up Oct. 21, 1988 at Suffolk Downs duringa dawn workout.   Of the 83 people, six were found to be in the United Stateslawfully. Some went home, while others admitted their illegalstatus and applied for asylum.   The rest invoked their Fifth Amendment guarantee againstself-incrimination at their deportation hearings. They want thegovernment to prove they are here illegally.   That isn't happening. Instead, INS attorneys are using anargument allowed in civil cases: that silence alone is ground fordeportation.   Charles Wheeler, director of the National Center for Immigrants'Rights in Los Angeles, called this development alarming.   ``It's disturbing if the immigration judge is making aninference from their silence that a person is an alien,'' he said.``It reverses the whole idea that you are innocent until provenguilty.''   But an INS official says the government is following precedentwell-established in civil cases.   ``The government doesn't have to do any more,'' said MichaelCreppy, acting deputy counsel for the INS in Washington. ``This isnothing new. The law is pretty clear in this matter. To me it'sjust a tactic to be able to stay here.''   Among the 38 aliens who invoked the Fifth Amendment was21-year-old Salvadoran. His story is typical, said Akram, whorequested the man be identified only as Jay.   One of 10 children in a farming family, Jay is from themountains of El Salvador, where the army and the anti-governmentguerrillas have been waging war. He said both sides terrorize theinhabitants.   Jay told his attorney that by age 19, he was forced to act fourtimes as a lookout on a guerrilla patrol. He knew better than toobject after seeing a friend's face shot off for refusing to act asa guerrilla informant.   Last year, Jay fled, taking a bus to Mexico. From there, hecrossed the U.S. border undetected and made his way from Californiato Massachusetts.   Two months ago, Jay had his day in Immigration Court. Theattorney for the INS questioned him about where he came from andhow he got here.   Jay replied in Spanish, ``I refuse to answer under theprotection of the Fifth Amendment of the United States because myanswer could incriminate me.'' The INS lawyer then asked the judgeto deport him.   Jay's case is on appeal before the Board of Immigration Appeals.   Wheeler said the use of the Fifth Amendment in deportation casesis rare but crucial.   ``It's an important defense and it would be a tragic betrayal ifthis was taken away from aliens,'' he said.   The INS' Creppy said the agency feels it will win.   ``When you weigh the public interest versus the aliens'interest, this is a case that is clear,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
