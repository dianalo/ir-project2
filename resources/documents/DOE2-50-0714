Usinglarge numbers of plants short time-courses of uptake and chase, {sup42}K{sup +} and {sup 22}Na{sup +} transport could be resolved, even duringa chase following a brief 10 minute labeling period. The use of intactplant systems allowed distinction of that portion of the isotope fluxinto the root, associated with the ion-conducting symplasms. A smallcompartment, which rapidly (t/sub .5/ andless; 1 min) exchanges with the externalmedium was implicated in the radial transport of N{sup +}, accountingfor the observed obtention of linear translocation rates within minutesof transferring to labeled solution. The ion contents of this compartmentvaried in proportion to the external ion concentration. When K{sup +}was at a high external concentration, labeled K{sup +} exchanged intothis same symplasm, but chasing a short pulse indicated that K{sup +}transport to the xylem was not through a rapidly-exchanging compartment.At physiological concentrations of K{sup +} the evidence indicated thattransport of K{sup +} across the root proceeded through a compartmentwhich was not exchanging rapidly with the external medium. The rise toa linear rate of isotope translocation was gradual and translocationduring a chase, following a brief pulse,was prolonged, indicating thatthis compartment retained its specific activity for a considerable period.</TEXT></DOC>
