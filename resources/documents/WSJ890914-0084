Everett Koop took a last swipe at the tobacco business in a vitriolic attack calling for an outright ban on cigarette advertising.    In testimony before a congressional subcommittee, Dr. Koop also lambasted several cigarette ads by name, and said that &quot;much of today's advertising for tobacco products is deceptive.&quot; Singled out for special criticism were ads for Lorillard's Newport, Brown andamp; Williamson's Kool, and RJR Nabisco's Camel cigarette brands.    The surgeon general, who steps down at month's end, used the hearing as a platform to take his parting shot at cigarette companies. He labeled Newport's &quot;Alive with Pleasure&quot; slogan as &quot;clearly . . . designed to undermine the surgeon general's warning,&quot; and quipped, &quot;truth in advertising would demand use of the slogan, 'Dying in Agony'&quot; instead.    Dr. Koop made his remarks on behalf of a bill proposing a ban on the use of pictures in cigarette ads, and allowing only all-print &quot;tombstone&quot; ads. The surgeon general, who has long advocated an all-out ban on cigarette advertising, said he supported the bill only &quot;as a reasonable compromise.&quot; He added, &quot;I would continue to endorse a total advertising ban as a long-term goal.&quot;    The surgeon general also lent his support to the bill's proposed ban on cigarette vending machines in public places accessible to children. &quot;Would we tolerate the sale of alcoholic beverages through vending machines?&quot; he asked. &quot;Of course not. Why, then, should we be so permissive with the sale of tobacco . . . ?&quot;    Dr. Koop's influence is limited, at best, however, and it isn't clear that his plea will have much effect in promoting the bill -- much less a total ad ban. He has already relinquished his duties to acting Surgeon General James Mason, and officially retires Oct. 1. And he prefaced his testimony by noting that his views &quot;are my own and do not represent those of the administration.&quot;    Cigarette industry executives were quick to downplay his remarks. A spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute, a trade group, said Dr. Koop was &quot;putting forth a good quote instead of thoughtfully presenting a case which could justify censorship.&quot; She added, &quot;It may be a case of preaching to the converted. He isn't bringing anything new to the table, and he isn't bringing anything compelling to the table.&quot;    Still, the surgeon general's stand gives the anti-cigarette ad forces an added measure of firepower, even as their number and influence grows. Several congressional efforts are under way to restrict cigarette advertising, with the tombstone-ad bill proposed by Rep. Tom Luken (D., Ohio) among the most visible. At the same time, ad industry executives are increasingly nervous about the Supreme Court's recent decisions favoring restrictions on commercial speech.    Dr. Koop took issue with the cigarette industry's contention that banning cigarette advertising would be unconstitutional, since selling cigarettes is legal. &quot;An advertising ban seems to me to be a reasonable middle ground between the status quo and a total prohibition of tobacco use,&quot; he said.    He also cited as &quot;highly objectionable&quot; two recent cigarette ads: a Kool campaign &quot;that clearly targets young people&quot;; and a Camel ad, with advice for picking up babes at the beach and a picture of a muscular hunk carrying a woman out of the surf, which he said &quot;suggests violence against women.&quot;    A spokeswoman for RJR Nabisco, which makes Camel cigarettes, said, &quot;We ran that ad just one time and it was meant to be a lighthearted, tongue-in-cheek approach. We never intended to offend anyone.&quot; At Brown andamp; Williamson, which makes Kool, a spokeswoman said, &quot;We believe that smoking is an adult custom. Our advertising is clearly directed only towards adult smokers.&quot; The proposed legislation, she added, &quot;is an attempt to legislate personal behavior that is both unfair and discriminatry to adult smokers.&quot;    ---   Ad Notes . . . .    OMNICOM GROUP: Omnicom sold a majority interest in ARA Group, its subsidiary in the Netherlands, to BDDP Group Paris. Terms weren't disclosed. Omnicom said it will continue to hold a 15% interest in the firm and ARA executives will obtain a substantial minority in the agency.    WHO'S NEWS: David Perry, 45, was named executive vice president, director of broadcast production at Saatchi andamp; Saatchi Advertising, New York.    WHO'S BAD? L.A. Gear Inc. said it has signed singer Michael Jackson to design and market world-wide a line of Michael Jackson fashion sneakers. The agreement is valued at more than $20 million, and will run for between 18 months and two years. The theme of the marketing campaign will be &quot;unstoppable.&quot; L.A. Gear said the agreement, effective immediately, is the first in which Mr. Jackson is actively involved in design of a product. </TEXT></DOC>
