<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-51-0678 </DOCNO><TEXT>Low Aspect Ratio is one of many design criteria for torsatrons. A newmagnetic field design technique based on the Hamiltonian structure ofmagnetic field line flow is used to investigate feasible torsatron configurations.Significant improvements have been made in the computer code IFS. Theproblem of too large a magnetic axis wobble has been solved with theaddition of an l = 1 m = 6 helical coil. A practical non-intersectingcoil set has been designed. 4 refs., 2 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
