Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the program,secretly started in 1986 and scheduled to begin deployment inthe late 1990s, is designed to produce a short-range,non-nuclear weapon that is more accurate and better able toevade radar than the current generation of cruise missiles.The new missiles would be used by the Army, Navy and AirForce.</LP><TEXT>   The announcement is expected to help Northrop, which iswaging an uphill battle to keep alive the B-2 Stealth bomber,from which it derives more than half of its revenue.Production of the Stealth missile could provide the company-- which recently lost a bid to build the Air Force's nextgeneration of jet fighters and was hurt by termination of theTacit Rainbow radar-killing missile -- an important source ofrevenue in an era of declining military budgets.   &quot;It shows people that Northrop has a bit of a future,&quot;said Howard Rubel, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence Inc.   Lawrence Harris of Kemper Securities Group estimated thatthe Stealth missile program is less than 10% complete, andthat Northrop was able to amend its fixedprice developmentcontract late last year in order to limit its financialexposure. That indicates that even though Northrop hasn'tbeen booking any profit on the project, it eventually couldbecome an important moneymaker.   Still, it isn't clear how much of a boost the missile willprovide in the short run for Northrop, which beat outLockheed Corp. for the contract. Despite its surpriseannouncement, the Pentagon didn't pull back the veil ofsecrecy to disclose how many missiles it intends to buy eachyear toward its ultimate goal of 8,650. Emphasizing that theproject remains so secret that no photographs can be relased,officials also declined to say how much already has beenspent on developing the weapon.   The Pentagon also announced that Boeing Co. was chosen asthe second source for the missiles, but didn't say how muchof the business it would get.   The new missile is unusual partly because it is intendedto be used by all three services. It can be fired from AirForce and Navy aircraft, B-52 and B-2 bombers, and the Army'sground-based Multiple Launch Rocket System. Moreover, it isdesigned for unprecedented accuracy. With a range of wellover 100 miles, it will be able to hit &quot;airfields, aircrafton the ground, ships in port and at sea, air-defense sites,and such high-value targets as command and control bunkersand aircraft shelters,&quot; Mr. Williams told reporters.   Industry consultants said the weapon could be upgraded tobe more accurate than the &quot;smart weapons&quot; used in the PersianGulf War, by dropping bomblets that use sophisticated sensorsto home in simultaneously on several individual targets.   Mr. Williams and other Pentagon officials said thatfunding for the missile, formally called the Tri-ServiceStandoff Attack Missile, is included in the Pentagon's latest1992-1997 spending blueprint. He said the Pentagon wentpublic at this time on the Stealth missile because of thedifficulty and expense of keeping a stepped-up testingprogram under wraps.   Yesterday's announcement came two weeks after the Houseapproved a defenseauthorization bill requiring the Pentagon,for the first time, to make public the overall price tag andcertain other information about its largest, most highlyclassified programs. &quot;Initially, there was a lot ofopposition to the idea&quot; from lawmakers, said Rep. John Kasich(R., Ohio), the main supporter of the change, but he said thelanguage reducing secrecy is expected to survive when Houseand Senate conferees work out the final bill this year.   Bringing the missile &quot;out of the covert world will help uscontinue proper oversight,&quot; House Armed Services Committeechairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.), and Alabama Rep. WilliamDickinson, the panel's ranking Republican, said in a jointstatement. They urged the Pentagon to review other so-called&quot;black&quot; programs &quot;to determine if more information can bemade public about them.&quot;   The defense industry for years has buzzed aboutdevelopment of a Stealth missile, but speculation about thesize and pace of the effort varied widely before yesterday'sannouncement.   Many analysts, tipped off by the Los Angeles-basedcompany's financial statements, have long believed Northropwas the prime contractor. For instance, Northrop tookwrite-downs of $150 million in both 1988 and 1989 onclassified, fixed-price, research-and-development contracts,the largest of which apparently involved the Stealth missile.Also, in the second quarter of 1986, Northrop made provisionsfor what it described as a &quot;classified new program . . .received during&quot; the period.</TEXT></DOC>
