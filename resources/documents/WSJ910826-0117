A First City spokeswoman said the transaction providedbenefits to both the banking company and the regulatoryagency. The FDIC, which was scheduled to pay off the note in$97 million quarterly installments until April 1993, was ableto borrow the money now at rates lower than the note'scontracted rate. Meanwhile, First City was able to reinvestthe funds in higher-yielding instruments.</LP><TEXT>   Since the $970 million was added to First City's capitalat the time the note was issued in 1988, however, theaccelerated payment doesn't provide relief for First City'sbiggest problem, its capital shortage. First City is seekingto raise $200 million in additional capital by next Januaryin order to boost its capital ratio, currently 6.32%, abovethe federal guideline of 7.25%.   First City has been the subject of much takeoverspeculation since A. Robert Abboud, the former Chicago bankerwho raised $500 million in private capital to take over thebank in 1988, was ousted by management earlier this year.BankAmerica Corp. and NCNB Corp. have been among the rumoredsuitors, along with an Arab group that reportedly wouldinclude Mr. Abboud. The banking company's fortunesdeteriorated rapidly this year after a series of risky,out-of-state loans went bad. In the first half, First Cityhad a loss of $130 million, or $7.63 a share, compared withyear-earlier profit of $109.9 million, or $4.46 a share,fully diluted. Nonperforming assets soared to $499 million inthe first half, more than double the $199 million recorded ayear earlier.   The FDIC payment does add liquidity to First City,although the spokeswoman said the company's liquidityposition remains strong despite a runoff of about 10% of itsdeposit base in the first half. That was higher than thecompany experienced in previous years, but it &quot;was nothingabove what we anticipated in our operating plan,&quot; she said.The company allowed some high-cost deposits to run off aspart of a planned downsizing, said Robert Brown, executivevice president, finance and operations.</TEXT></DOC>
