 Low speeds can bog down the most patient worker.andM;2 Make sure you are buying a terminal that allows room for expansion--if youanticipate such a need.andP;  Some graphics terminals let you add input devices,memory or LAN connection devices.andM;3 Don't be misled by low prices.andP;  &quot;You get what you pay for&quot; doesn't alwayshold true: Some vendors are offering more for less to stay in thecompetition.andM;4 Be sure that the model you select supports the input devices yourapplications demand; some may be optional and add to the price.andM;5 Decide how many colors you really need.andP;  You'll pay considerably more for agraphics terminal that can display more than 16 colors at once.andM;Low-to Medium-Resolution GraphicsandM;Terminals Speed Up To Keep UpandM;The local processing power of PCs and workstations, offering freedom fromterminal-host I/O bottlenecks, is casting shadows over the future of low-tomidrange graphics terminals.andM;Confronted with competition on every side, low- to medium-resolution graphicsterminals are geared for battle.andP;  An increasing number of graphics terminalvendors are offering X windows compatibility, as well as boosting theirdrawing speeds.andP;  Industry analysts believe X windows will soon become thestandard graphics terminal user interface.andM;Nonetheless, graphics terminal vendors contend their products are often themost cost-effective platforms for running CAD/CAM and process controlapplications.andP;  Low- to medium-resolution graphics terminals--defined here asterminals that produce or reproduce an on-screen vertical resolution of 1,000pixels or less--are also especially useful for digital mapping, vendors said.andO;Their use in financial institutions has also grown.andM;Price and performance are inseparable in the graphics terminal market, andcompetition is waged on both fronts.andM;Prices for low- and medium-end graphics terminals remained stable during thelast year.andP;  &quot;We try to provide higher performance for the same price, or thesame performance but at a lower cost,&quot; said Drew Davis, systems marketingmanager of Tektronix Inter-active Technologies Division.andM;COMPETING AGAINST PCsandM;Pcs are the principal alternative--and threat--to low- to medium-resolutionDEC-compatible graphics terminals, according to market analysts and vendors.andO;Windowing programs have been incorporated in PCs for some time, vendorsnoted, though they are a relatively new craze in graphics terminals.andM;PCs are very versatile, commented Herb Berkwits, executive vice president ofPsiTech.andP;  &quot;Load some communications software onto a PC and you have amedium-resolution color graphics terminal,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;And by the way, it canalso run Lotus 1-2-3 and Zork!&quot;andM;The PC can be an ideal substitute for a graphics terminal if a great deal oflocal processing power is needed, industry analysts said.andP;  Users who alreadyhave a PC can simply load graphics terminal emulation software, and the PCwill function like the real VT McCoy.andM;For companies starting from scratch, however, PCs don't always make economicsense.andP;  Purchasing a large number of terminals can represent a significantsaving over buying an equal number of PCs.andP;  Most low- to medium-resolutionDEC-compatible graphics terminals are less than $3,000, whereas an80386-based IBM PS/2, with a resolution of 640-by-480 pixels, isapproximately $5,500.andP;  That price includes a 60MB hard disk but not a monitoror software.andM;Industry analysts cite the utility of a PC as a graphics terminal as a reasonfor slow growth in graphics terminals sales.andP;  But the movement towardcompatibility with X windows is expected to breathe new life into the market.andM;PSiTech's Berkwits expects much from the change.andP;  &quot;The most important featureeveryone is going to have to get behind is X windows,&quot; Berkwits said.andP;  &quot;Oncestandards seemed unimportant to the computer industry, but the pendulum isswinging the other way.andP;  X windows is the first step in thatstandardization.&quot;andM;GraphOn and Human Designed Systems are among the low- to midrange graphicsvendors who have announced X windows display devices.andP;  GraphOn's Optimax 200currently offers X windows support and, according to GraphOn President WaltKeller, the GO-250 will begin offering X windows support sometime thissummer.andM;X WINDOWS SOFTWARE WATCHandM;DEC has developed DECwindows (a graphical interface based on the X WindowSystem developed at MIT), but has not yet produced a graphics terminal tosupport it.andP;  According to Eileen O'Brien, senior research analyst at themarket research company International Data Corp. (IDC) in Framingham, Mass.,andO;DEC is waiting for the introduction of more applications software thatsupports X windows before providing DECwindows in a graphics terminal.andM;Robert Price, DEC's manager of press and consultant relations for low-endsystems, noted that DEC currently offers &quot;X windows on the desk top&quot; for PCand work-station users.andM;Berkwits believes that the X windows terminal will be competitive withworkstations in many graphics applications that put light demands on the CPU.andO;&quot;In a CAD environment that consists of graphics terminals, VAXes, andworkstations, an X windows terminal is the perfect solution for a manager whoworks with spreadsheets and graphing programs,&quot; Berkwits said.andP;  Design work,he added, often requires a workstation.andM;PsiTech will soon market a large-screen, medium-resolution, color X windowsterminal that will be priced in the $6,000 range.andP;  &quot;A manager can use thisterminal in place of a workstation in the $12,000 range and still have accessto the design data,&quot; Berkwits said.andP;  &quot;The X windows terminal certainly won'treplace the workstation, but in cases like these it works just as well forhalf the cost.&quot;andM;Low- to medium-resolution graphics terminal drawing speeds are increasingsteadily.andP;  Jeff Ost, Pericom's sales manager, said his company has boostedterminal drawing speeds to help its products compete.andM;Higher speeds make it possible to run sophisticated operations such asdigital mapping on a midpriced, medium-resolution terminal.andP;  &quot;We're seeing awhole new realm of users like the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S.andO;Geological Survey,&quot; Ost Said.andP;  &quot;They use graphics terminals for digitalmapping.andP;  It's a growing application.&quot;andM;Typically used in computer-aided design, graphics terminals have also becomepopular in process control applications, which monitor machinery or equipmentby presenting an illustration of the operating system.andP;  Color is key in thoseapplications and can be used, for instance, to highlight an area in which thesystem is malfunctioning.andM;Ost also noted the growing use of graphics terminals in financialinstitutions.andP;  &quot;The move is to present some of their financial datagraphically,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Color and graphics make interpretation of data thatmuch easier for [stock traders].&quot;andM;Tektronix has attempted to increase the connectivity of graphics terminalswith its new 4211 Graphics Netstation.andP;  The product reflects the industry'smovement toward distributed processing.andM;The Netstation is a network of terminals connected to hosts via Ethernet aswell as standard serial connections.andP;  A Netstation can be connected by aserial connection to a VAX and simultaneously be linked to other Netstationsand workstations through Ethernet.andP;  A user can access design data for a CADapplication on the VAX and then process it using the power of one of theworkstations on the network.andM;MORE REFRESHING THAN EVERandM;The use of a non-interlaced display monitor has become almost standard,according to industry analysts.andP;  Vendors touting &quot;high performance&quot; oftenpoint to their non-interlaced displays, which provide higher resolutions atlower refresh rates.andP;  With interlaced displays, only half the terminal screenis refreshed each time it is scanned.andM;Just five of the 41 DEC-compatible low- to medium-resolution graphicsterminals have interlaced monitors.andP;  &quot;Interlacing is dead,&quot; said one vendor,&quot;because you have to give up so much brightness.&quot;andM;Some vendors, making display quality a priority, have boosted their refreshrates to 70Hz.andP;  &quot;We used to think that a 60Hz non-interlaced display was thebest you could get, but 70 Hz really does look better,&quot; Berkwits said.andP;  &quot;[Theeffect] is almost subliminal.&quot;andM;Other vendors have been content to stay with a 60Hz rate.andP;  According toTektronix's Davis, &quot;There are all kinds of scientific measurements for thequality of the monitor, but in the end, it's which one you like.&quot;andM;INPUT DEVICE OPTIONSandM;Most graphics terminal applications require input device support beyondkeyboards.andP;  The mouse is the current favorite, but PsiTech's Berkwits notedthat the track ball is also popular, especially with military customers.andM;Stan Jessen, product manager for Advanced Terminal Products at Intercolor,said that many of his company's process control customers use keyboardlesssystems with touch screens.andP;  The screens are viewed as ideal input devicesfor terminals in a factory environment, where even ruggedized keyboards couldeasily be damaged.andM;Many terminals also support tablets with styluses or pucks.andM;Color and graphics have always gone hand in hand.andP;  &quot;In most cases, thestandard 16 colors are enough,&quot; Ost of Pericom said.andP;  Applications thatrequire more colors are those that use shading to create subtle effects, henoted.andM;The size of the color palette, or the number of colors from which a user canchoose displayable colors, is a key consideration.andP;  Advanced ElectronicsDesign, GraphOn, and Pericom all offer terminals with exceptionally largepalettes.andP;  Pericom's MX7300, for example, has a palette of 256,000 colors.andO;&quot;That's larger than most of our competitors,c Ost said, &quot;but that has notbeen a selling point.andP;  The size of a palette that a user needs depends on theapplication.&quot;andM;Many vendors concentrate solely on color products, and most market analystsview color as a growing trend.andP;  &quot;For the vast majority of the market,monochrome is history,&quot; Intercolor's Jessen said.andM;COLOR ISN'T EVERYTHINGandM;Monochrome terminals remain viable for some applications.andP;  Color is not anecessity in many desktop publishing applications, where most documents areprinted in a single color.andM;Tektronix's Davis noted that monochrome monitors are also suitable for userswho run mostly text-oriented applications, spending a small portion of theircomputing time--maybe 10 percent--running graphics applications.andM;Monochrome gray-scale monitors are especially suited for desktop publishingapplications.andP;  Illustrations printed in one color use many shades of thatcolor, and a gray-scale terminal can duplicate the look of the final printeddocument on screen.andM;Although vendors concede that growth in the low- to medium-resolutiongraphics terminal market is limited, most characterize the market's health asstable.andP;  Market analysts paint a gloomier picture, however.andM;&quot;There's a question about the viability of the market,&quot; said Bob Murray, ananalyst for CAP International's Color Image Processing Services.andP;  &quot;People arewondering what's going to happen to terminals in view of the growth of PCsand workstations.&quot;andM;&quot;No, the terminal market isn't going away, but projections are cautious,&quot;Murray continued.andP;  &quot;Compared to the overall computer graphics market, thegraphics terminal market will grow at a less aggressive pace.&quot;andM;O'Brien of IDC found that her 1987 to 1988 growth projections for thegraphics terminal market were overly optimistic.andP;  The market saw only an 8.1percent growth in units shipped, which was four percent less than she hadoriginally forecasted.andM;O'Brien believes that the market is reaching maturity faster than anyone hadpredicted.andP;  &quot;I don't anticipate any new vendors entering the market,&quot; shesaid, &quot;except perhaps for text terminal vendors offering X windows.&quot;andM;With the increased use of X windows and faster drawing speeds, vendors oflow- to medium-resolution graphics terminals are attempting to curb the agingprocess of the market and to spice up its life.andM;Speedy Co-ProcessorsandM;A single microprocessor handles all terminal functions as well as graphicsvector calculations in many graphics terminals.andP;  As vector lengths increase,however, it becomes necessary for the processor to temporarily halt data flowfrom the host to perform computations.andP;  This slows terminal I/O considerably.andM;To ease this bottleneck, increasing numbers of vendors have added graphicsco-processors to their terminals.andP;  A co-processor facilitates full-speed datatransmission by letting a graphics terminal perform graphics calculationsindependent from the host CPU.andM;In most cases, co-processors compute graphics vectors and enable lines to bedrawn, while the primary (host) CPU handles other tasks like communicationsand keyboard control.andM;In addition, graphics terminals equipped with graphics co-processors ofteninclude native mode commands, which let users perform operations locally andtransmit changes to the host computer only when needed.andM;According to the vendors who offer them, graphics co-processors increase aproduct's processing speed substantially.andM;The problem is, such speed tests can be based on a wide variety ofoperations, and the measurements themselves are often beguiling.andP;  Marketanalysts generally say the best speed test is an on-site demonstration: Thatis, buyers should see--and clock--a given terminal and co-processor in actionas it runs their applications.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
