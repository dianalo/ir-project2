While a country-and-western band belted out twangy tunes, eager Berliners rushed the information booths and lugged away sacks of maps and leaflets on everything from sightseeing flights over the Grand Canyon to the Freedom Walk in Boston to American Airlines' new services to Europe.    Clearly, the U.S. is this year's hot destination for European tourists.    Jose Estorino, Florida's international tourism chief, took a break from handing out oranges at the fair to say: &quot;The business is back, and we're getting a bigger piece of it. All in all, European arrivals in Florida are up 54% (from a year earlier). We have warehouses here and in Britain, and we can't keep them stocked with literature. The demand is incredible.&quot;    Next door, at Tennessee's booth, representatives handed out lapel pins and brochures about the Grand Ole Opry. This year &quot;probably is going to be exceptionally good,&quot; said Sybil Waters Stewart, a state tourism official. &quot;There is a desire to visit America.&quot;    The main reason for all this interest isn't very mysterious. Seen in the window of American Express Co.'s office in Geneva, Switzerland, is a banner that reads: &quot;USA '87 with Swissair. Profit from the fall in the dollar.&quot;    &quot;Who knows when the dollar will be like this again?&quot; asks an Austrian government employee who plans to take his wife and three children to Hollywood, Disneyland, Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon in July. &quot;It's now or never.&quot;    Last year, as Chernobyl, terrorism and the falling dollar kept many Americans away from Europe, Europeans quietly were taking stock of favorable exchange rates and low air fares and heading off to the U.S. In 1986, according to the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration, travel to the U.S. by Europeans jumped 23% to almost 3.5 million.    And the boom is continuing. The agency projects a further increase of almost 8% this year to nearly 3.8 million Europeans visiting the U.S. Charter flights to the U.S. are sold out. U.S. consulates in Europe are jammed with people seeking tourist visas.    &quot;Two years ago, the shoe was completely on the other foot,&quot; says Jennifer Brown, whose Scottsdale, Ariz.-based travel company markets U.S. hotels and airlines in 17 countries.    &quot;It's crazy,&quot; says Jacques Klein, director of Pacific Holidays, a travel agency in Paris. &quot;It's overwhelming. Reservations to the U.S. were up 50% in February compared with the same time last year. . . . We're selling everything from dude-ranch packages to young kids buying a plane ticket and (staying at) the YMCA.&quot;    The American Express office in Madrid, Spain, is experiencing a similar rush. &quot;Trips to the U.S. for the Easter holidays are up dramatically,&quot; says spokeswoman Ruth Torres.    The flood of visitors may be heightened by the U.S. Travel and Tourism office's first-ever overseas television advertisements. The initial series of ads, to run on British commercial television for four weeks starting April 24, will urge viewers to &quot;catch the spirit of America&quot; by visiting New England; the agency expects to feature other regions in subsequent campaigns.    According to the Travel and Tourism agency's London office, Florida, California and New York top the list of destinations for European visitors -- especially those making their first trips. Last year, according to an official in that office, two-thirds of Britons visiting the U.S. went to at least one of those three states. The most popular attractions include Manhattan, Disney World and Hollywood.    Among more experienced travelers, the Southwest is gaining. Many West Germans this year are renting recreational vehicles and driving from Los Angeles to the Grand Canyon and around national parks in southern Utah. Says Gerhard Laemmle, a travel agent in Munich, West Germany, &quot;They want to experience the settings of the westerns they've been watching on TV all their lives.&quot;    New England also is making some gains, especially with fly-drive packages from New York and Boston, agents say. And because television viewers in much of Europe are hooked on the show &quot;Dallas,&quot; Texas has made strides, with many Europeans trekking to J.R. Ewing's ranch. </TEXT></DOC>
