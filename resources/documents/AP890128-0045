Holding his first news conference as president on Friday, Bushdisplayed ease and confidence in fielding reporters' questions in asession that ranged in topics from abortion to foreign relations.   Bush today was meeting with former Secretary of State HenryKissinger for a briefing on his recent trip to the Soviet Union.Kissinger met with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and deliveredpersonal greetings from Bush.   Tonight, Bush's schedule includes an appearance at the annualdinner of the all-male Alfalfa Club in Washington. The group eachyear hosts a humorous dinner with remarks by prominent politiciansand business leaders.   Despite the club's all-male membership, Bush ``will follow thetradition of past presidents and attend,'' said White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater.   The decision was criticized by Ann Lewis, a women's activist andprominent Democratic political consultant, who cited the club as anexample of how women are excluded from opportunities to makebusiness connections.   She also gave a copy of a rule in the federal personnel manualthat states ``federal personnel acting in their official capacitiesshall not participate in any conference or meetings held infacilities in which discrimination is practiced on the basis of sex,religion or national origin, as well as race.''   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, is the outgoing president of theclub.   In his news conference Friday, Bush deflected questions aboutsuch controversies as a possible fee on deposits at banks and thriftinstitutions, and the abortion views of Dr. Louis Sullivan, hisnominee for secretary of health and human services.   ``I think it's been a wonderfully harmonious week,'' Bush said.``And these are just little ripples on the surface of an otherwisecalm pond.''   He downplayed the Treasury Department plan on the savings accountfee, saying that was ``an option, not a proposal.''   Bush said the administration was reassessing all aspects ofU.S.-Soviet relations. He said he doesn't think the Soviets consider``that as foot-dragging. I'm confident they don't.''   Asked if he felt there still was a ``Cold War'' between Moscowand Washington, Bush said he wanted to avoid the phrase.   ``If someone says `Cold War' to me, that doesn't properly givecredit to the advances that have taken place in this relationship,''the president said. ``But if it's used in the context of, are westill unsure of _ in our predictions on Soviet intentions _ I'd haveto say, yes, we should be cautious.''   During his campaign, Bush declared, ``the Cold War is not over.''   On Friday, Bush said he wanted to take the offensive on foreignpolicy rather than merely react to moves by the Soviets, adding,``But prudence is the order of the day.''   On other topics, Bush:   _ Said of the pay raise that would bring salaries for members ofCongress to $135,000 a year: ``A raise is overdue, there's noquestion about that.''   _ Said Iran ``can have an influence'' in winning the release ofthe American hostages in Lebanon even though it does not actuallyhold them. He recalled ``a period of time when we had excellentrelations with Iran, and I don't want to think that the status quohas to go on forever.''   _ Discussed this week's Supreme Court decision that sharplyrestricted the ability of state and local governments to reserve afixed percentage of contracts for minority businesses without proofof past discrimination. Bush said, ``I will not read into that amandate to me to stop trying on equal employment and on affirmativeaction generally,'' he said.   _ Asked how long his campaign promise against any new taxes wouldlast, said, ``I'd like it to be a four-year pledge.''</TEXT></DOC>
