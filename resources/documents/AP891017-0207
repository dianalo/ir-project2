This is one of aperiodic series of articles, ``The '90s,'' looking ahead to thepromise and peril of the upcoming decade, in the environment,medicine, technology and society.</TEXT><BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   The U.S. energy picture for the 1990s is a blur of dark linesand bright signs: doubt about ensuring stable prices and steadysupplies, but also promise of technological leaps toward a moresecure energy future.   Such consumer advances as compact fluorescent light bulbs,``superwindows'' that better insulate buildings, and more efficientrefrigerator motors are just over the horizon. The efficiency ofthese new products should partly offset the expanded use ofelectricity in the '90s.   Energy projections over the past two decades have beenastonishingly far off the mark, proving that the energy economy istoo volatile to follow a predictable path. Even so, the consensusview is that oil prices, now $16 to $18 a barrel, will hold fairlysteady in the early 1990s, and then move moderately higher.   Analysts are quick to note, however, that the trend in oilprices over the past two decades has been determined largely bypolitical events and market reactions almost no one foresaw.   Experts say forces already at work point to key energy themesfor the 1990s:   _More automobiles will be powered by fuels other than gasoline,as the nation looks for environmentally safer alternatives that canlessen dependence on foreign oil. Some may use hydrogen gas madefrom water, using electricity generated by the sun. Fuels made fromnatural gas, coal and grain are likely to become more common.   _The federal government will push harder to revive atomic power.Tax dollars may be used to develop a nuclear reactor with addedsafety features, but public opposition to the atom is likely topersist. A key focus of debate: how to store growing tons ofnuclear waste. Relatively ``clean'' energy from nuclear fusion willremain only a distant prospect.   _Decisions about developing traditional U.S. energy resources _oil, natural gas and coal _ will become more intertwined withworries about the harmful environmental effects of finding,extracting, moving and burning these fossil fuels.   _The nation will become more dependent on foreign oil andnatural gas as domestic oil producers look abroad for drillingprospects.   _Houses and commercial buildings will become moreenergy-efficient, with compact fluorescent lights and otheradvanced appliances, and ``superwindows'' whose glazing offersgreater protection from the extremes of the air outside.   These trends suggest conflicting signals about American energyfortunes in the next decade: new possibilities for popularizingmore benign fuels, but uncertainty about a commitment to move awayfrom the most polluting ones, especially oil.   The Bush administration is already promoting a revival ofnuclear energy, stagnant since the mid-1970s, but electricutilities say major changes in state and federal regulations willbe needed before they will build more plants.   Complicating the outlook is a warning from the utility industryand many energy analysts that some regions _ especially theNortheast _ could face electricity shortages early in the 1990s.Others foresee plenty of power if the government does more to pushenergy efficiency and conservation.   While energy sources favored by environmentalists _ including``renewables,'' such as sunlight, wind, water, wood and geothermalsteam _ are likely to gain more favor in the next decade, Americaand the world still will run mainly on oil.   Modern economies, quite simply, are wedded to oil. Little couldchange that in the 1990s.   ``It is and will continue to be the critical commodity in all ofour economic and strategic planning well into the next century,''said Henson Moore, the deputy U.S. energy secretary.   Joseph Stanislaw, an analyst in the Paris office of CambridgeEnergy Research Associates, said the United States will face an oilcrunch sometime in the 1990s if, as expected, U.S. oil productionkeeps falling and demand keeps rising.   ``We're like a shark driving through the water wanting more andmore imported oil,'' he said.   Critical, too, then, will be the actions of the OPEC oil cartel,which teetered on the brink of extinction in the mid-1980s but nowseems poised for a comeback.   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries engineered oneof history's greatest transfers of wealth when it jacked up oilprices after the 1973-74 Arab embargo against the United States andagain in 1979 when oil buyers reacted with panic to a shutoff ofIranian oil output.   Almost no one in the West had foreseen those events. Nor didmany expect the crises to create an energy conservation ``chic''that would quickly discredit the mid-1970s predictions that oilsoon would shoot up to $100 a barrel.   After peaking at $40 a barrel in 1980, oil's price fellsteadily, capped by a stunning _ and largely unforeseen _ collapsein 1986 to below $10 a barrel.   Although energy developments of the past decade were largely areaction to the oil price pain of the '70s, trends in the coming 10years are likely to be determined by still-emerging responses tothe price declines of the '80s.   The key uncertainties:   _Will the nation's rapidly growing dependence on foreign oilundermine its security?   _Will oil imports rise so rapidly as to give OPEC renewed powerto dictate prices?   _If prices do stay low, will efforts to develop alternate energysources be abandoned? Will that, in the longer run, make thecountry even more beholden to OPEC?</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wednes PMs, Oct. 25, and Thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
