<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-08-1446 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method is described for the colorimetric determination of iodine iniodated salt. It is based on oxidation of DPC reagent by iodate ion inacidic medium. The resultant DPCO is extracted in CCl/sub 4/. The absorbanceof this extract measured at {lambda}86 and {lambda}58 nm gave quantitativemeasure of the iodate-DPC reaction.</TEXT></DOC>
