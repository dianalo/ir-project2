The method comprisesintroducing a gas stream through a multiplicity of openings within aninlet means into the standpipe in a direction toward the slide valvefrom a position closely adjacent to the slide valve. The apparatus comprises:(a) a bin for containing a supply of particulate; (b) a valve positionedbeneath the bin; (c) a first conduit connecting the bin with the valve,the conduit forming a standpipe; (d) a hollow sparger ring circumferentiallyextending around an inside surface of the first conduit between the binand valve at a position immediately adjacent to the valve. The hollowring having apertures for introducing a fluid into the first conduitin the direction of the valve to reduce the pressure drop across thevalve.</TEXT></DOC>
