<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-40-1162 </DOCNO><TEXT>An application was made before the National Energy Board of Canada forapproval of a license to export natural gas through Ontario to the USA.The customer in the USA will use the gas to fuel a new cogeneration facilityto be constructed in Syracuse, NY which will produce electricity to besold to a utility and steam to be sold to various institutional customersin the surrounding area. An export impact assessment was performed, andindicated that the proposed annual export volumes were small comparedto Canada's supply and requirements, and should have little impact onCanadian production, consumption and prices of natural gas. The Boardalso examined the contracts executed by the applicant and various customersin the USA. A unique aspect of the gas sales agreement is an up-frontpayment of $70 million (US), a pricing provision intended to providea measure of cost certainty to the institutions financing the project.Another feature of the agreement is that it allows for interruptibletransportation in both the USA and Canada in the event that firm transportationis not available. The Board also examined the gas supply available tothe applicant and was satisfied that adequate gas supplies will becomeavailable to meet the requirements of the gas sales agreement. In addition,the applicant's cost-benefit analysis of the proposed gas export saleis discussed. A license was issued to export at total of 3,381 millionm/sup 3/ of gas from 1990 to 2010.</TEXT></DOC>
