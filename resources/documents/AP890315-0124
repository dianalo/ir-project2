March 14   The Evening Times, Pawtucket, R.I., on John Tower:   Senate Republicans, and the Republican vice president of theUnited States, Dan Quayle, have both charged partisan politics inthe Senate's refusal to confirm John Tower as secretary of defense.   How unfortunately partisan that accusation sounds.   If the shoe were on the other foot _ a Democrat in the WhiteHouse and the GOP in control of the Senate _ one would hope that anequally second-rate candidate would be given the boot.   Tower was not the right person for the job, not only because hesavored the sauce but also because he curried favor with the defenseindustry.   The Tower debate was not a question of political power. It was aquestion of the lifestyle of a man in control of the nation's tanksand missiles. And he came up short.</TEXT><TEXT>   March 10   The Brainerd (Minn.) Daily Dispatch on John Tower:   To hear some Republicans react to the defeat of John Tower asnominee for secretary of defense, you'd think the republic wascoming to an end.   ``The partisan taste of this debate is going to linger,'' saidSen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis. ``This is going to make it damn tough forus to act in much of a bipartisan manner in the months ahead.''   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said the setback willstay in his memory.   Fortunately, others had a clearer perspective that life goes on.   Vice President Dan Quayle showed he is maturing in the job whenhe said, ``We have a job ahead of us. We have an agenda ahead of us.And we're going to need the help and cooperation of the DemocraticCongress.''   On with the job, please.</TEXT><TEXT>   March 14   Delaware County Daily Times, Primos, Pa., on Bush and theenvironment:   President Bush charted an ambitious course of environmentalactivism (Monday), promising to:   _ Throw the book at ocean dumpers.   _ Support aggressive criminal prosecution of those who damage theenvironment.   _ Submit legislation to reauthorize the Clean Air Act.   _ Suggest new standards to reduce industrial emissions that causeacid rain.   _ Step up the Superfund cleanup program.   _ Assure compliance with hazardous waste.   Bush didn't say how he proposed to meet all his goals but he tolda group of state attorneys general that it was high time everyonefrom the president on down got with the program ... before it's toolate.   The prosecutors welcomed his resolve. There were a few ...,however, who tempered their enthusiasm with old-fashionedskepticism. Tom Miller, Iowa's attorney general, was one.   ``I heard all the right words,'' Miller said. ``However, we haveto recognize that words are the easy part.''   As long as the president and Miller's fellow attorneys generalalso recognize ``words are the easy part of it,'' the environmentmight have a chance after all.</TEXT><TEXT>   March 14   The Clarion-Ledger, Jackson, Miss., on terrorism:   The FBI still is seeking clues and gathering evidence from lastFriday's bomb attack aimed at the family of the skipper of the USSVincennes. ...   Since the Navy skipper, Will Rogers, commanded the missilecruiser that mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner in the PersianGulf last July, Iran is high on the suspect list.   But whether it was Iran, one of any Iranian extremist faction,another country or another group, response must be swift and severe.The president should not shy away from a military strike in thiscase.   It is true that there is no sure defense against terrorism. Butit is also true that the best prevention is for outlaw nations andgroups to know that they will pay the price. That is the onlyresponse terrorists understand.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
