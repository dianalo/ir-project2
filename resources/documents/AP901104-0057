The panel of about 700 experts, meeting for a U.N. climateconference, unanimously said that over the past decade a ``clearscientific consensus has emerged'' on global warming expected tooccur in the next century.   The report is intended to be used by policymakers. It set fewtargets, but environmentalists said its conclusions provide anotherspur for the United States to act.   Washington says more research is needed before targets can beagreed for cutting emissions of heat-trapping ``greenhouse gases.''   The conference report, finished late Saturday, will be forwardedto a landmark meeting of ministers in Geneva from Monday toWednesday. Heads of government due to attend include primeministers Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Michel Rocard of France.King Hussein of Jordan is also expected.   The ministers are due to give formal blessing to the launchingof global negotiations on warming, scheduled for February.   Daniel Becker of the Washington-based Sierra Club saidenvironmental groups welcomed the ``very strong statement by thescientists,'' but that the draft ministerial declaration remainedunder a cloud.   Officials drafting the declaration Sunday remained locked insharp differences of approach, mainly between Washington and theEuropean Community, which urges quick action. The EC wants tostabilize carbon dioxide output at current levels by the year 2000and a commitment to reductions after that.   The scientific panel included members from the United States andthe Soviet Union, the two biggest contributors of man-made carbondioxide.   The gas, much of which is released by burning fossil fuels, isbelieved to account for more than half of the heat-trapping``greenhouse effect'' that causes global warming.   ``Countries are urged to take immediate actions to control therisks of climate change with initial emphasis on actions that wouldbe economically and socially beneficial for other reasons aswell,'' the report said.   It said ``technically feasible and cost-effective opportunitiesexist to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in all countries.''   More research is needed but remaining uncertainties should notdelay action, the report said.   The final version of the report said ``many industrializedcountries'' can reduce their carbon dioxide output by at least 20percent by 2005. Soviet scientists objected to an earlier draftthat said ``most'' instead of ``many.''   Drawing on numerous published studies, the experts againoutlined the climate upheaval that global warming could cause.These include flooding of vast coastal areas and islands as sealevels rise. Global warming is also fear as a threat to farming,forests and fishing.   Apart from carbon dioxide, the report cites chlorofluorocarbonsand methane as major greenhouse contributors.   Scientists believe that if nothing is done to curb them,emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases couldboost global temperatures 5.4 degrees by the end of the nextcentury, the fastest rise in 10,000 years.</TEXT></DOC>
