RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court ruled Monday thatskyrocketing punitive damage awards in personal-injury lawsuitsdon't violate the Constitution's ban on excessive fines.   But the 7-2 ruling left open the possibility that due-processguarantees _ the Constitution's assurance of fair play for all _ maybe used to put a cap on the amount of money in such suits.   Some justices practically invited a new appeal to resolve thedue-process issue.   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, in aconcurring opinion, said the ruling ``leaves the door open for aholding that the due process clause constrains the imposition ofpunitive damages.''   Some studies show punitive damages have soared in recent years.One such study found that the average punitive damage award inpersonal injury cases in Cook County, Ill., was $14,000 for afive-year period ending in 1969 and $1.9 million for a comparableperiod concluding in 1984.   Industry spokesmen were disappointed with Monday's ruling, buthopeful they could win in the future.   ``We're happy to see at least four justices interested in the dueprocess challenge,'' said Quentin Riegel, a lawyer with the NationalAssociation of Manufacturers. ``I expect a quick acceptance of acase with that issue, perhaps later this week.''   The court upheld a $6 million award a jury ordered a Houstonwaste-collection company to pay a Vermont competitor for trying todrive the New England company out of business.   Writing for the court, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said theConstitution's Eighth Amendment prohibiting cruel and unusualpunishment and excessive fines doesn't apply to civil lawsuitsbetween private citizens or corporations.   The ban is designed to protect people against excessivepunishment by the government, generally in criminal prosecutions, hesaid.   ``The fact that punitive damages are imposed through the aegis ofcourts and serve to advance governmental interests is insufficient''to apply the excessive fines clause to a private suit, Blackmun said.   He relied in part on the U.S. Constitution and also on Englishcommon law dating to the 13th century when, Blackmun said,``awarding damages far in excess of actual compensation forquantifiable injuries was well recognized.''   Blackmun suggested the court might be willing to place a ceilingon such awards if it could be shown that run-away juries violateddue-process standards.   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and John Paul Stevens, in adissenting opinion, said punitive damages may violate theConstitution's ban on excessive fines.   Business leaders have clashed for years with lawyers and consumergroups over the legitimacy of multimillion dollar awards in a widerange of lawsuits.   Those who oppose the big-money awards say they are catastrophicfor American competitiveness and development of new products,particularly new forms of medical treatment.   They say juries capriciously penalize the wealthy to benefitthose who have suffered injuries, particularly if the victim is fromnearby and the defendant is from another state or region.   Consumer activists and trial lawyers say punitive damages are apowerful deterrent to corporate greed that poses a threat to publicsafety. They say smaller compensatory awards may be viewed by largecorporations as a cost of doing business.   Some state legislatures, reacting to soaring insurance rates,have imposed ceilings on how much money can be recovered inpersonal-injury cases.   Monday's case involved a $6 million punitive damage award againstBrowning-Ferris Industries Inc., a waste-collection company based inHouston with annual revenues exceeding $1.3 billion. The company wasordered to pay the money to Kelco Disposal Inc. of Burlington, Vt.   Joseph Kelley left Browning-Ferris to form Kelco in 1980 and sooncaptured more than 40 percent of the market in the Burlington area.   Browning-Ferris allegedly instructed its new Burlington managerto ``put Kelley out of business. Do whatever it takes. Squish himlike a bug.''   Browning-Ferris cut prices almost in half, but failed to driveKelley out. Browning-Ferris ultimately left the Vermont market.   A Vermont jury awarded Kelco $51,146 in compensatory damages and$6 million in punitive damages.</TEXT></DOC>
