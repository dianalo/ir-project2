Press Association said the new equipment will help avertsabotage by computer amateurs known as hackers and by enemies whouse ``computer viruses,'' alien coding that insinuates itself intoa system.   The detecting system was installed at the GovernmentCommunications Headquarters in Cheltenham, about 110 milesnorthwest of London, the agency reported. The listening facilitysifts through radio and other airborne messages, seeking militaryand other secret communications.   ``The nation's enemies have almost certainly tried to placedamaging software within our systems,'' Rupert Soames, managingdirector of GPT Data Systems, was quoted as saying. His companydeveloped the system.   A computer virus is a small piece of code inserted into a systemto corrupt data. It can infect other computers through networks orexchanged software, or can lie dormant until a pre-determinedcommand activates it.   ``One of the main concerns with the Strategic Defense Initiativein the United States is its vulnerability to viruses and logicbombs which would only trigger under war conditions,'' Soames wasquoted as saying.   The SDI space-defense project, commonly called ``Star Wars,''program, would use computer-guided lasers to shoot down enemymissiles.   Soames told the news agency several American companies haveexpressed interest in the detecting system.</TEXT></DOC>
