The move, which had been expected, paves the way for Congress to compel Rear Adm. Poindexter to end months of silence and help resolve some of the most important and nagging questions about the scandal.    Congressional investigators contend that Adm. Poindexter's testimony is necessary to determine the role of other administration officials in the secret arms sales to Iran and the suspected diversion of funds to the Nicaraguan insurgents. Moreover, the investigators said that Adm. Poindexter should be able to say whether President Reagan approved the creation of the private network to aid the Contras and whether Mr. Reagan authorized or knew about the National Security Council's role in directing it.    Meanwhile, aides of the House and Senate committees investigating the matter said they also hope to obtain bank records and other information from retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, who played a central role in the weapons sales to Iran and arms shipments to Nicaraguan insurgents.    One congressional investigator said some form of immunity for Gen. Secord is part of the overall discussions with his lawyers. Other sources, however, maintained that the talks are in their early stages and lawmakers haven't decided whether Gen. Secord should be granted immunity. His attorney couldn't be reached for comment.    &quot;The two committees are working in tandem, and there isn't any difference of opinion about the strategy,&quot; said one congressional investigator.    The negotiations involving Gen. Secord are a sharp departure from earlier efforts by congressional investigators to try to isolate Gen. Secord and deny him immunity from prosecution, while offering such protection to several of his former associates.    The Senate committee previously filed a lawsuit to try to compel Gen. Secord to disclose foreign bank records, but a federal district judge last week ruled that such an order would violate his constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination. Both Gen. Secord and Adm. Poindexter have cited their Fifth Amendment rights in declining to testify or cooperate in other ways with congressional or criminal investigators.    Meanwhile, law-enforcement officials said Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel investigating the Iran-Contra affair, has begun looking into reports that a secret Army anti-terrorist unit may have set up a numbered Swiss bank account in 1983. That account, according to a report first aired by CBS News, was used later by Gen. Secord and Lt. Col. Oliver North to funnel aid to the Contras in violation of congressional restrictions on such assistance.    Pentagon spokesmen declined to comment on the reports, except to say that neither Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger nor Secretary of the Army John Marsh approved any improper fund transfers. Officials said that Mr. Walsh, among other things, wants to determine if Col. North, the fired White House aide, ever controlled the account. The prosecutor also wants to find out why earlier Army audits and Justice Department investigations of the antiterrorist unit's finances failed to disclose possible links to Col. North or Gen. Secord.    The House committee is expected today to formally grant Adm. Poindexter limited immunity. But under an agreement between the two committees and Mr. Walsh, congressional investigators won't begin interviewing Adm. Poindexter until May 2 and he won't testify in public until June 15.    Under the committees' plan to grant &quot;use&quot; immunity, Mr. Walsh couldn't use any information contained in Adm. Poindexter's testimony as evidence against the former national security adviser unless the prosecutor could show that he got the information elsewhere.    The delay is intended to give Mr. Walsh time to gather evidence and file it in court under seal before Adm. Poindexter testifies. </TEXT></DOC>
