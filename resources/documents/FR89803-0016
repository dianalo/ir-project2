Thresholds forreviewing contract actions are revised, the process for obtaining finalclearances prior to awarding major acquisitions is added, coverage forthe ratification of unauthorized procurement actions is relocated to conformto FAR and is enhanced, relevant changes are made to the Contracting OfficerCertification Program, and organization title changes are made throughoutthe regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> August 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Chris A. Figg, Acquisition ManagementService (93), Office of Acquisition and Materiel Management, Departmentof Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC (202) 233-3054.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background </ITAG>This regulation revises and adds internal administrative oversight of theVA acquisition program, relocates certain material in order to conformto the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) format, adjusts requirementsfor the VA Contracting Officer Certification Program, and updates variousVA organizational titles. The VA Acquisition Management Service and the Office of General Counselprovide legal and technical review for proposed contract actions at specifiedthresholds. This regulation revises the thresholds in order to provideuniformity and it delegates legal/technical review for VA Marketing Centercontracts. Additionally, the regulation provides for a technical reviewof certain proposed contracts just prior to contract execution. This regulationunifies all FAR/VAAR individual deviation authority into the Office ofAcquisition and Materiel Management. Coverage regarding the ratification of unauthorized commitments was recentlycodified in the FAR. VAAR 801.603-72, covering this subject, is removedand necessary supplementing and implementing guidance is relocated to 801.602-3to conform to the FAR numbering system. VAAR 801.403 is revised to specifythat the Director, Office of Acquisition and Materiel Management, is theofficial to approve individual FAR and VAAR deviations. This is prescribedin order to provide for a single office for such deviation approval. The VAAR revised coverage for the VA Contracting Officer CertificationProgram includes several amendments intended to strengthen the programby clarifying the warranting process and clearly specifying that lack ofprogress in attaining requisite training requirements could result in lossof contracting authority. VA finds good cause exists for making these regulations final without previouspublication of a notice of proposed rulemaking. All the changes are internalVA management policies and public participation is therefore unnecessary(5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)). <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>Pursuant to the memorandum from the Director, Office of Management andBudget, to the Administrator, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,dated December 13, 1984, this proposed rule is exempt from sections 3 and4 of Executive Order 12291. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) </ITAG>Since a notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary and will not be published,these amendments do not come within the term ``rule'' as defined in theRegulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601(2), and are therefore not subjectthe requirements of the Act. Nevertheless, these amendments will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesas they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>These amendments do not impose any additional reporting or recordkeepingrequirements on the public which require the approval of the Office ofManagement and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 801 </ITAG>Government procurement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: July 25, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward J.

The final decision as to the action to be taken, however,must be made by the contracting officer in each instance. To reduce tothe absolute minimum the possibility of litigation resulting from his/herdecision, the contracting officer shall, except as provided in paragraph(c) of this section, submit the problem through channels in sufficientdetail to the General Counsel for advice or assistance. (b) While legal review and concurrence of the General Counsel is requiredprior to a default termination, in some cases where a quick response isnecessary, this review can be expedited by express mailing or telefaxingthe default letter and related documents which are required to make anevaluation directly to the General Counsel (025).
