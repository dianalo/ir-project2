Has Satan established astronghold in the ancient city famous for its religious icons?</TEXT><BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TURIN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Real or imagined, the devil is tormentingthis sober industrial city in northwestern Italy.   Some believe a sinister presence lurks in the shadows along thecity's broad, arcaded boulevards and haunts the medieval squares inthe nearby mountain hamlets of the Piedmontese Alps.   The city likes to be remembered as the former seat of the Houseof Savoy dynasty, the first capital of a unified Italy, the restingplace of saints and religious relics, the home of the Fiat autoempire.   It's also the home of the Shroud of Turin, which some believewas the cloth with which Joseph of Arimathea wrapped the body ofJesus Christ after his crucifixion.   But Turin has a darker reputation as a haven for Satan and hisdisciples.   There is no proof, of course. But what is certain is that thecity has six official exorcists, an underground core of devilworshipers and thousands of people dealing in the occult.   Specialists in the occult maintain that Turin forms part of two``magic'' triangles representing good and evil.   Along with Prague, Czechoslovakia, and Lyon, France, the city isreputedly a center of ``white magic,'' a positive force. Turin isalso said to join London and San Francisco as a stronghold of``black magic,'' which is considered harmful or diabolic.   ``Turin has always been a place of great spiritual and magicalferment,'' says Giuditta Dembech, a journalist and author of thebook ``Torino: Citta Magica'' (Turin: Magic City). ``It has some ofthe qualities of places like Mecca, Jerusalem and Lourdes.''   The city first attracted widespread notoriety as a devil'splayground four years ago when Turin's archbishop at the time,Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero, appointed six official exorcists.   Exorcism, the process of casting out demons, is an acceptedpractice in the Catholic Church. Pope John Paul II has frequentlystated that the devil is a pervasive reality in today's world.   The naming of the six exorcists in Turin followed a directivefrom Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, prefect of the Vatican'sCongregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, for churches toexercise greater control over exorcisms.   ``Unfortunately some of our priests had gone a little too farand were performing exorcisms too hastily,'' says Canon GiuseppeRuata, who heads Turin's pool of official exorcists.   Two events in 1988 further contributed to the city's satanicimage.   First, the pope spoke of the devil during a visit to Turin,saying: ``From the history of salvation, we know that where thereare saints there is also another person who presents himself not byhis name but the name of others. He is called the prince of thisworld, the demon.''   Then, a month later, Turin hosted a weeklong conference ondemonology that bitterly divided local politicians, churchmen andacademics.   Church officials deny Turin has a greater problem with the devilthan any other cities, pointing out that Milan tops Italy witheight exorcists of its own. Milan has a population of 1.5 million,compared with Turin's 1 million.   ``Turin has an image it doesn't deserve,'' Ruata, 74, said in aninterview at the archdiocesan offices. ``I wouldn't make Turin outto be the capital of the demonic empire.''   Most agree, however, that Turin has an unusually high number ofmagicians, seers, faith healers, mind readers, astrologers andothers dabbling in superstition and witchcraft. They advertisecontinuously on private television and radio.   ``There are more than 100 of these types of agencies in Turin,''Ruata says. ``They charge $400 as the initial fee for removing aspell. It's a huge form of trickery.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
