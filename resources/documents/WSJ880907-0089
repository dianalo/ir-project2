Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The presidential contest yesterday was bogged down by ideological hecklers and technological hassles.    The most serious setbacks hit Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, who began the second day of this important Labor Day week with a speech in suburban Niles, Ill., that was repeatedly interrupted by anti-abortion demonstrators. A short while later, the Massachusetts governor was forced to cancel the rest of his campaign day after a Federal Aviation Administration inspection grounded his chartered campaign plane.    Meanwhile, GOP nominee George Bush's day was largely drowned out by union shipyard hecklers at a marine ironworks plant in Portland, Ore. Along with obscenities, the shipyard workers called the vice president a &quot;union buster,&quot; and he was badgered about his dealings with Panamanian military ruler Manuel Noriega.    The heckling of the candidates seemed more pronounced than in comparable early stages of most recent elections and may reflect the largely negative tone of the campaign. If it continues, the candidates may be forced to adopt new strategies to get their messages across.    The most serious threat probably is the anti-abortion effort against Mr. Dukakis. Yesterday, he was ambushed by a small group of activists in a Polish community hall. A scuffle ensued in the audience with some punches thrown, some clothing torn and some demonstrators propelled out of the hall. A day earlier, a similar group disrupted his remarks in Philadelphia.    After yesterday's incident, Joseph Scheidler, executive director of the Chicago-based Pro-Life Action League, vowed similar disruptions wherever Mr. Dukakis travels this autumn: &quot;This is just the beginning.&quot; Mr. Scheidler, who said that the demonstrations weren't coordinated with any Republicans, seemed to welcome the physical disruptions. &quot;We know political crowds are some of the most violent crowds around.&quot; But he insisted, &quot;We've got to do this because this is the most important issue around.&quot;    The disruptions against Mr. Bush don't appear as organized, and the Republican candidate may find it easier to avoid scenes like the disgruntled Oregon shipyard workers.    Both candidates sought to play down the troubles. &quot;All I need is 51% of the vote,&quot; declared the vice president. &quot;You don't let them rattle you.&quot; And in a television interview in Everett, Wash., he appealed &quot;to my supporters and his to at least let people speak without harassing.&quot; Mr. Dukakis, who opposes measures to restrict abortion and favors public funding for abortions for poor women, said: &quot;I just hope the campaign goes on and we address the real issues.&quot;    But the Dukakis campaign already is considering tougher security measures to control who gets admitted to events. However, some Democrats believe that if the hecklers become too strident, the disruptions will produce a sympathy backlash.    The FAA's grounding of the Dukakis charter plane yesterday forced the candidate to cancel an event in Columbus, along with a series of press interviews in Ohio, a state the campaign considers a key battleground in the election. The FAA later explained that the Presidential Airways charter was pulled out of service after FAA inspectors found four malfunctions on the plane. </TEXT></DOC>
