To Post 17% Increase In Its 4th-Period Net </HL><SO> </SO><CO> DIET </CO><IN> CEO </IN><DATELINE> REXBURG, Idaho  </DATELINE><TEXT>   American Health Cos. said it expects to report that profit for the fourth quarter ended March 31 rose more than 17% to about $2.7 million, or 39 cents a share, from $2.3 million, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier.    The year-earlier earnings reflected a loss from discontinued operations of $200,000, or two cents a share. Revenue grew about 5% to $12.5 million from $11.9 million.    All year-earlier per-share figures are restated to reflect a 10% stock dividend paid in September 1987. As of March 31, the company had 6,950,000 shares outstanding, down from 7,150,000 a year earlier because of a buy-back after the October stock market plunge.    American Health licenses Diet Center franchises, and sells related lines of diet foods and nutritional supplements for weight loss.    For the full year, the company expects to report net income rose more than 20% to $8.9 million, or $1.27 a share, from $7.4 million, or $1.12 a share, in fiscal 1987.    The fiscal 1988 results include a loss from discontinued operations of $1 million, or 14 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss from discontinued operations of $415,000, or six cents a share. Revenue rose almost 10% to $45.2 million from $41.2 million.    &quot;It's our 17th year of record revenues and profits,&quot; said Michael Ferguson, president. Mr. Ferguson said in an interview that the company plans a sustained growth of about 100 to 120 new franchises a year. The company gets 56% of its revenue from continuing license fees from operators of its 2,300 Diet Centers nationwide.    He said he also foresees the introduction of an additional five to 10 new products for dieters, including its Sybil's Kitchen brand of convenience meals, which require no refrigeration and can be microwaved.    Mr. Ferguson said the company, which currently has no debt and boasts an average return on stockholder equity of more than 23%, looks for a good year in fiscal 1989. &quot;Nothing tells us we shouldn't sustain this kind of growth,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
