The board ruled that such an action can't take place until the agreements expire or until employees covered by the agreements vote to reject their bargaining representative.    The board's unanimous decision, released yesterday, represents a new policy on pre-hire agreements in the construction industry. Under such agreements, an employer typically promises to hire union workers before commencing a construction project.    The decision overrules the board's 1971 decision in an earlier case, which held that a construction industry employer could repudiate a pre-hire agreement without violating labor law.    Federal labor law authorizes a construction industry employer to enter into an agreement with a union even though the union hasn't demonstrated that it represents a majority of the employees.    The board noted in yesterday's ruling that once an agreement has expired, the union loses its presumption of majority status that it enjoyed during the term of the agreement. As a result, the employer may not be compelled to negotiate a new pre-hire agreement.    In its decision, the board said the policy will &quot;provide greater stability&quot; in the industry by precluding parties from unilaterally repudiating their voluntary agreements. At the same time, the board said the policy protects &quot;employee free-choice principles.&quot;    The board's decision &quot;substantially changed what has been the labor law in the area,&quot; said Gerard Smetana, a Chicago attorney who represented an employers' group in oral arguments before the board. The results are &quot;more good than bad for employers,&quot; he said, because employers can now request a union-representation election &quot;at any time to get out of such an agreement.&quot; If employees voted to reject the union, the employer would no longer be bound by the agreement.    But a spokesman for the Associated General Contractors of America said the group was &quot;disappointed&quot; with the ruling.    The case involved John Deklewa andamp; Sons, a Pennsylvania construction concern, which notified the International Association of Bridge Structural andamp; Ornamental Iron Workers union in 1983 that it was repudiating its pre-hire agreement in midterm and withdrawing recognition from the union. The board, in yesterday's decision, held that the employer's actions violated labor law. </TEXT></DOC>
