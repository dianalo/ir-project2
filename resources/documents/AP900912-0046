Speaking to Congress on Tuesday, Attorney General Alfonso GomezMendez said the government's campaign to seize drug wealth ``hasbeen a failure because it has represented more costs to the nationthan benefits for the community.''   Gomez's statements were published in major Bogota newspapers.   Since beginning an anti-drug crackdown in August 1989, thegovernment has seized about 670 real estate properties allegedlybelonging to drug traffickers. Among the seizures are hotels, nightclubs, luxury homes, ranches, 23 clandestine airports, 365 cars and68 airplanes, according to government figures.   Gomez said the goods, estimated to be worth hundreds of millionsof dollars, were taken by the state ``without being judicially andtechnically prepared to administer them.''   He warned that innefficient bureaucracy may force the governmentto return many of the properties.   Gomez added that the confiscations have generated corruption inthe judicial branch because many judges have returned propertiesunder suspicious circumstances. About 40 Colombian judges are nowbeing investigated for possible abuses.   Other officials are being investigatied for alleged embezzlementof drug traffickers' goods.   Gomez said police and army costs for maintaining the goods aretoo high. He said 16,000 security officers are needed to guard them.   President Cesar Gaviria has said Colombia's drug war cost thecountry $1 billion in the last year.   Gaviria's predecessor, Virgilio Barco, began the crackdown inAugust 1989 after the Medellin cocaine cartel was blamed formurdering a presidential candidate.</TEXT></DOC>
