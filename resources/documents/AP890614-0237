(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thousands of West Virginia coal minerstoday continued a wildcat strike _ hundreds of them in defiance of afederal judge _ and the walkout spread to Virginia.   About 650 Westmoreland Coal Co. miners in southwest Virginiawalked off the job this morning, company spokesman Steve Andersonsaid.   The wildcat action began Monday when an estimated 10,000 minersin West Virginia walked out in support of 1,600 fellow United MineWorkers who have been on strike in Virginia and West Virginia sinceApril 5 against Pittston Coal Group, the nation's largest coalexporter.   U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp on Monday and Tuesday issuedback-to-work orders covering 450 UMW members at more than a dozenWest Virginia mines, but many of the workers affected stayed off thejob today.   ``Everything's the same as it was yesterday,'' said PaulKvederis, a spokesman for Consolidation Coal Co., which had about250 miners out.   In ordering the miners back to work, the judge said it appearsthe union is violating a no-strike clause in its 1988 nationalcontract. Union officials have insisted that they did not authorizethe walkout. They did not return telephone calls today.   Some strikers said they will remain off the job until three unionofficials are released from the Roanoke, Va., jail, where they arebeing held for violating a state judge's order limiting picket-lineactivity at Pittston mines. The judge has also imposed $3 million infines.   Roger Caldwell, a UMW field representative, said the walkout is aresult of ``the massive fines the court's putting on us and thejailing of our people down there and I think they've come to thepoint where enough's enough.''   Caldwell estimated that 98 percent of the miners in Logan andMingo counties, the heart of the southern West Virginia coal field,were on strike Tuesday.   ``No reason for the unauthorized work stoppage has beencommunicated to management,'' said Tom Clarke, a spokesman forPeabody Holding Co., which reported 2,360 miners off the job. ``Ourpolicy is not to talk to the miners until they return to work.''</TEXT></DOC>
