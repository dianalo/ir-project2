The suit, which seeks class-action status, challenges the Miami thrift's interpretation of preferred stockholders' conversion rights in its proposed acquisition by Kinder-Care Inc., a holding company based in Montgomery, Ala.    The suit asserts, among other things, that American Savings preferred stock should remain convertible into American Savings common stock after the merger is completed.    The suit names American Savings, its directors, Kinder-Care and Kinder-Care affiliates involved in the transaction.    In a statement, American Savings said it and Kinder-Care intend to proceed with the proposed acquisition and &quot;to defend vigorously this challenge.&quot;    American Savings said a special meeting of common stockholders is set for Monday to act on the proposed acquisition. </TEXT></DOC>
