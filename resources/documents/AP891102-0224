It's even more scary.''   About 120 buildings are destroyed every day in Tokyo alone, thelocal government says.   Scientists say that inhaling asbestos can cause fatal lungdamage, including asbestosis and cancer.   At a recent seminar in Tokyo, Dr. Irving Selikoff, a professorof medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, urged theJapanese to cut asbestos consumption and promptly tighten safetymeasures.   The mineral fiber is used in some 3,000 common items, includingwalls, roof tiles and automobile brakes.   Japan considers asbestos contamination an occupational problemand has compensated 65 victims, including 43 lung cancer patients,said Teruo Arakawa, a Labor Ministry spokesman. He said he had nofigures on how many had died.   In work places handling the material, Japan allows 10 times asmuch asbestos fiber in the air as the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency _ 2 fibers per cubic centimeter for most kinds of asbestos.   Japan has decided, however, to set a general limit for asbestosin the air, effective at the end of this year, but the figure hasyet to be announced.   It banned the spraying of asbestos insulation in 1975, butgovernment officials say materials containing asbestos areindispensable for fireproofing.   Gov. Shunichi Suzuki of Tokyo, who once promised to make Tokyoasbestos-free, now says the material is safe ``as long as it's notsprayed.'' Asbestos is being used in a new city hall building.   Japan has no plan to follow the U.S. move to ban allasbestos-containing material from public schools by 1996.   In 1987, however, the Education Ministry ordered 47,000 publicschools throughout Japan to inspect sprayed asbestos in classroomsand gymnasiums, said Kiyoshi Sawamoto, an Education Ministryspokesman.   Only 1,366, or 3 percent, of the inspected schools reported theyhad sprayed asbestos, and some 1,000 have removed it, Sawamoto said.   More than 50 percent of Japan's classrooms and gymnasiums werebuilt before 1975, when asbestos was widely sprayed, he added.   Because it is difficult to learn the locations and condition ofasbestos in buildings, even well-planned demolition is never safeenough, said Sentaro Yamazaki, a representative of Nippon AsbestosAbatement Industries Association.   ``Once fibers are released in the environment, they cannot beretracted,'' he said.   No law requires contractors to warn neighbors of buildingdemolition projects, Yamazaki added.   The government says Japan used 320,000 tons of asbestos _ 80percent for construction _ in 1988. The amount will surpass 350,000tons in 1989, said Akinobu Ito of the All Japan Dockworkers' Union.   Asbestos factories are required to conduct air samplings twice ayear and report the results, but regardless of the outcome, thereare no provisions for penalties or mandatory health checks, saidJun Sakamoto, spokesman for the Environmental Agency.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Friday PMs Nov. 10</NOTE></DOC>
