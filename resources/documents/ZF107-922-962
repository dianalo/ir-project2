 DOS 4.01, $99.andM;In Short: The Ultra 10-386 is handicapped with below-average construction,but features in its favor include Orchid's ProDesigner Plus graphics ca.rdand high resolutions, including Super VGA and 1,024 by 768 mode.andM;Computer MarketandM;Place Ultra 10-386andM;A computer a la carte is what you get when you order the $2,397 Ultra 10-386from Computer Market Place.andP;  An enticing entree even at its most ordinary,the Ultra 10-386 gives you a taste of its real potential through a variety ofside dishes.andM;The circuit chef at Computer Market Place knows his ingredients.andP;  He startswith a Micronics 386 system board, which operates at an unalterable 20 MHz,and ladles it into the time-proved AT packaging, giving you the gusto of ahearty chassis with five half-height drive bays, all of which offerfront-panel access.andP;  To suit your personal tastes, you can add either anIntel 80387 or Weitek 3167 numeric coprocessor.andM;Unfortunately, the $2,397 price of the Ultra 10-386, with its 2MB RAM, 40MBhard disk, and VGA, doesn't include the one ingredient that could make itreally savory--memory caching.andP;  Adding the cache is a $299 option thatsubstitutes a memory board featuring an Austek A38152 cache controller and32K of 35-nanosecond SRAM in addition to the 2MB of the standard board.andP;  DOS4.01 is available at $99.andM;Because the system board is crowded with discrete circuitry (no VLSI forMicronics), there's no room for memory, all of which resides on a single32-bit expansion board occupying one of the system's eight slots.andP;  Maximum32-bit system memory is 16MB.andP;  The base board holds a total of 2MB, as 72256-kilobit DIP chips rated at 80 nanoseconds.andP;  The Ultra 10-386 lets youshadow ROM and video BIOS in faster RAM but gives you the option of disablingthis feature.andM;The remaining two 8-bit and five 16-bit slots operate at 10 MHz.andP;  An 8-bitI/O adapter that delivers the system's two serial ports (one with a 9-pinconnector, one with a 25-pin), one parallel port, and game port.andP;  Two 16-bitslots are given over to video and disk control, leaving four free slots inthe tested unit.andM;MEMORABLE VIDEOandM;The standard video board is a ProDesigner Plus from Orchid Technology, ahigh-speed 16-bit board equipped with a full 512K RAM featuring resolutionsup to 1,024 by 768 and 256 colors in Super VGA mode.andP;  The ProDesigner Plusdemonstrates some of the snappiest performance seen in a budget machine,although this still left it significantly slower than the bellweather CompaqDeskpro 386/20.andP;  It's complemented by a NEC MultiSync 2A display, althoughComputer Market Place delivered a 3D for review (a $100 option) because itwas out of stock on the lower-priced monitor.andM;Mass storage includes a TEAC 1.2MB floppy disk drive and a standard SeagateST-251-1 40MB hard disk.andP;  Both are governed by a Western Digital controllercard (which supports 1:1 hard disk interleaving).andP;  The 200-watt Taiwan LitonElectronic Co. power supply offers two free drive power connectors for futuremass storage expansion.andM;EASY SETUPandM;The Ultra 10-386 uses the latest Phoenix BIOS, which puts setup just a pressof Ctrl-Alt-Esc away no matter what you're doing with your system.andP;  Nooperating system is included in the standard price of Ultra 10-386.andP;  If youpay the $99 that Computer Market Place charges for DOS 4.01, however, thesystem will be delivered with the DOS shell already installed on the system'shard disk.andP;  The company does not offer OS/2.andM;Packed with the Ultra 10-386 is an Nan Tan Computer 101-key Enhanced-stylekeyboard.andP;  A free 72-inch extension cable is packed with the keyboard tolengthen its already generous 84-inch cable.andM;Beside the usual indicators, the front panel of the Ultra 10-386 provides areset switch and a cylindrical keylock that secures both the case andkeyboard.andP;  The rear panel include three 25-pin cutouts for adding D-shellconnectors.andP;  All factory-installed connectors are identified by adhesivelabels.andM;The case of the Ultra 10-386 earns only an FCC Class A certification and thesystem a B-minus for construction.andP;  Although hardly exemplary, it's up tosmall-shop standards--which means it has the typical snarl of ribbon cableinside.andM;Computer Market Place extends a one-year warrantly to cover its work and thesystem board; the Orchid video board and NEC monitor bear their ownmanufacturers' warranties (three and two years, respectively).andP;  For majorfailures, the company promises a 48-hour replacement service using overnightcouriers.andP;  If that still doesn't get you up and running, the company willsend a nationally known repair service to your office.andM;If you don't mind picking and choosing from a menu of add-on components andthereby incurring added cost, you can soup up the Ultra 10-386 into a topperformer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
