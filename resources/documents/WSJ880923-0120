Karr (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><G> LBR </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal research agency charged that a Labor Department proposal wouldn't adequately protect workers who are repairing potentially dangerous equipment.    The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) testified in a department hearing that new rules should require that powered machinery be locked so that it cannot be turned on when maintenance or service work is being done. Rules recently proposed by the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration would permit the use of tags to warn against turning on equipment that is under repair.    OSHA has said that its proposed standard, which has been under development for a decade, would save an estimated 122 lives and prevent 60,000 injuries a year.    But NIOSH, a Health and Human Services Department unit, joined labor unions and other critics of the OSHA plan in saying that the existing, more-limited OSHA &quot;tagout&quot; requirements have been shown by OSHA data to be &quot;not sufficiently protective.&quot;    Richard Neimeier, an official of NIOSH's division of standards development and technology transfer, said in the OSHA hearing, &quot;Tags only provide a warning and are subject to a number of abuses.&quot; Among the abuses, he said, co-workers sometimes remove tags before maintenance is done, and officials at times are negligent about removing tags when repairs are finished, causing &quot;general disregard&quot; for tags.    The OSHA proposal would cover general industry. It would go beyond current rules contained in several agency standards covering such equipment as powered industrial trucks, cranes, power presses, forging machines and sawmills. The agency has said that 7% of all workplace deaths are caused by failure to shut down equipment during maintenance. It said the new rules would protect about 39 million workers.    The proposed rules wouldn't cover oil and gas-well drillling, electric utilities and work on electric conductors and equipment, for which specific maintenance-period procedures are being developed. OSHA also has promised to work on rules to cover agriculture, maritime and construction employers. </TEXT></DOC>
