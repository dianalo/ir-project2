Rates on three-month Treasury bills fell as much as 1.2 percentage points, and rates on bank certificates of deposit also fell sharply. Bond investors were encouraged by large declines in the price of gold and other commodities that act as inflation indicators.    Although the stock market rebounded yesterday, Monday's record losses altered many analysts' economic forecasts. &quot;The prospects for economic growth are reduced, and so are pressures for inflation,&quot; said Donald Straszheim, president of Merrill Lynch Economics. &quot;You've got to be more optimistic about the rate outlook.&quot;    In one of the most chaotic sessions ever, prices of actively traded 30-year bonds swung wildly throughout the day. Some issues wound up in New York with gains of about 2 3/4 points, or $27.50 for each $1,000 face amount, and then advanced another five-eighths of a point in early trading in Tokyo today. Early yesterday, some long-term issues were up as much as seven points as fear of a recession gripped the stock and bond markets.    &quot;This was the most volatile market I've seen in my life,&quot; said Paul Jacobson, a manager of government bond trading at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;We've seen a super interest rate cycle in one day.&quot;    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. recorded its biggest one-day advance since the index was started at the end of 1980. The index jumped 46.44 points to 1198.91. That easily surpassed the previous record gain of 37.40 points Oct. 12, 1982. Yesterday's point change exceeded any advance or decline in the index. It ranged between 1178.78 and 1231.08.    &quot;This is a market being driven by emotion at the moment,&quot; Mr. Jacobson added. &quot;We saw enormous flows of funds from people getting out of stocks and into bonds.&quot; Since last Thursday, the yield on actively traded 30-year Treasury issues has fluctuated between 10.45% and 9.08%; prices have ranged between about 85 1/2 and 98 1/2.    An investor who bought such a 30-year bond Monday afternoon and sold it yesterday afternoon would have made a profit of $74.50 for each $1,000 invested, according to Ryan Financial Strategy Group. &quot;That 7.45% (24-hour) total return is the best in recorded history,&quot; said Ron Ryan, managing director of the data service.    Most investment grade corporate bonds also rallied sharply, and many companies announced plans to make debt offerings in the days ahead. But the stock market crash sent shudders through the so-called junk bond market, where prices of many non-investment grade securities plummeted nearly three points, or almost $30 for each $1,000 face amount.    &quot;If the stock market is signaling big troubles ahead in the economy, the junk bond market faces double jeopardy,&quot; said a senior analyst at a large securities firm. Yesterday, for example, Borg-Warner Corp.'s 12 3/4% bonds due 1997 were quoted by dealers at a price of 85 1/2 to yield 15.70%, down from a price of 88 Friday.    &quot;For a while at least, the bear market in bonds is over,&quot; said William Gross, a managing director at Newport Beach, Calif.-based Pacific Investment Management Co. &quot;It was clear that we had come to the brink with interest rates rising irregularly higher. Now the Fed has apparently decided the economy can't stand the pain&quot; of a stock crash.    &quot;As long as the stock market remains depressed, the potential for a recession has increased dramatically while the outlook for interest rates has improved immeasurably,&quot; Mr. Gross said.    Mr. Gross says Pacific Investment, which manages about $13.5 billion, bought more than $300 million of long-term Treasurys last week and another $100 million Monday as the stock market sell-off ignited an explosive bond market rally.    Richard B. Hoey, chief economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said the firm's investment policy committee also turned bullish on the bond market Monday afternoon. &quot;The economic fundamentals that generated a world-wide trend of central banks raising interest rates are obsolete right now,&quot; he said.    A senior administration official indicated yesterday that the Fed already has begun to ease credit. The federal funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight and which is watched closely for clues to changes in monetary policy, averaged only 7.16%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That was down sharply from Monday's average of 7.61%.    At one point late yesterday, the funds rate was quoted at 6 3/4% bid. Asked whether the Fed is easing policy, the administration official said: &quot;The federal funds rate is 6 3/4%. That speaks for itself.&quot;    Nevertheless, Mr. Hoey said bonds could still remain in a long-term bear market that took off last spring. &quot;A temporary weakening of credit demands and consumption don't represent a resolution&quot; of budget and trade deficit problems, he added. &quot;We've got a disinflation push on at the moment and that's good for bonds. But it's hard to say where exactly rates are headed. I'm changing my forecasts hourly,&quot; he said.    Edward S. Hyman, vice chairman of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc. and one of the most bearish analysts on the bond market the past several months, said he's changed his mind. &quot;I've turned bullish on bonds,&quot; he said, citing Monday's stock market rout and falling commodity prices. &quot;I think the economy is going to slow down, and I think (long-term Treasury) bond yields are going to go to 8 1/2% over the next three months.&quot;    Asked about the possibility of a round of coordinated discount rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and other foreign central banks, Mr. Hyman replied: &quot;I sort of doubt it. I'm scared if there were coordinated cuts in discount rates, the bond market might view it as inflationary and sell off.&quot;    Texas industrialist H. Ross Perot said those who contend that the fundamentals of the U.S. economy are sound &quot;haven't done their homework,&quot; and that the nation's good health is being supported by foreign investment. Speaking to the annual convention of the American Bankers Association yesterday, Mr. Perot likened Monday's stock market plunge to &quot;a warning light flashing on an aircraft instrument panel.&quot;    As short-term rates fell, three banks that had recently raised their prime, or base rates half a percentage point to 9 3/4%, reversed field and lowered it back to 9 1/4%. The three were Chemical Bank, Marine Midland and First RepublicBank, Dallas.    The sharp drop in interest rates the past two days prompted many companies, including Borden Inc., Johnson andamp; Johnson and Ford Motor Credit Corp., to announce plans for long-term debt offerings soon. But only two new issues surfaced yesterday.    The Export-Import Bank of Japan sold $250 million of 10 1/8% notes due October 1997. Underwriters led by Goldman Sachs priced the notes at 99.45 to yield 10.214%, or 0.8 percentage point more than the Treasury's 10-year note.    Separately, the Inter-American Development Bank sold $200 million of notes due October 1997. Underwriters led by Goldman Sachs priced the 9 1/2% notes at 99.56 to yield 9.61%, or 0.7 percentage point more than the Treasury five-year note. Holders have the option of selling the notes back to the agency at par in five years. The issue is rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    In the municipal new-issue market, Washington sold about $188 million of various purpose general obligation bonds due 1988-2012. Underwriters led by Goldman Sachs priced the bonds after auction to yield from 6.25% in 1988 to 9.20% in 2009-2012. The issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody's and double-A by Sandamp;P.    In the bond market, the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 were quoted yesterday evening at a price of 93 26/32, up sharply from 91 1/32 Monday evening. The yield dropped to about 9.50% from 9.81%. The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 climbed to 95 6/32 from 93 25/32, as the yield declined to 9.38% from 9.61%.    The rate on the latest three-month Treasury bills plummeted to 5.65% bid late yesterday from an average of 6.84% set at Monday's auction by the government. The rate on the latest six-month Treasury bills fell to 6.20% bid from Monday's auction average of 7.21%.    The Treasury today is scheduled to sell around $9.25 billion of two-year notes. Late yesterday, the notes were quoted in when-issued trading to yield about 8%. </TEXT></DOC>
