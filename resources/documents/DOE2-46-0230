Maximum biogas production and biogas yieldreached during the 6.2 day HRT phase were 1.9 Nm/sup 3//day and 1.7 Nmm/sup3//m/sup 3/, respectively. The microbiological analysis made at the endof the trial period evidenced that (a) no clogging or channelling wasobserved, (b) the support media was partially colonized, (c) the bacteriacount showed a substantial equilibrium between suspended and attachedgrowth.</TEXT></DOC>
