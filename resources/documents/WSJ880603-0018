Short-line railroads were booming. Growth forecasts were buoyant. So Chicago-based Venango confidently dived into debt to pay $81 million for the IC Industries branch line, which it named the Chicago, Missouri andamp; Western Railroad.    But like many others, Venango figured wrong about light-density rail lines. Two months ago CMandamp;W sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, claiming it was the victim of operating losses, high debt, rotted track, and traffic levels far below projections. Venango sued IC Industries, which has since denied the allegation that it overstated CMandamp;W's revenue and diverted freight after the sale.    Though its failure may be the most marked, CMandamp;W isn't the only new railroad to face setbacks. Chicago, Central andamp; Pacific Railroad and Gulf andamp; Mississippi Railroad, each created when IC Industries split off sections of track, have gone through restructurings. And while backers point out that some new lines have been highly successful, few industry analysts are predicting growth in short-line and regional railroading.    New line sales have stalled almost entirely in recent months due to investor caution and legal challenges by rail unions. Unless the impasse ends soon, major railroads are threatening to scrap lines they had planned to sell. &quot;If we can't sell our marginal lines, the only alternative is abandonment,&quot; says John Snow, president of CSX Corp.    General abandonment of short lines would be a tragedy, say railroad officials. Since 1980, major railroads have sold off surplus lines to 190 new companies that now operate 17,000 miles, or 10% of the nation's track. &quot;The new railroads have saved service on thousands of miles of line that a decade ago would have been torn from the ground,&quot; says John Riley, head of the Federal Railroad Administration.    There's a lot at stake for major railroads, which are counting on line sales to reduce costs. Increasingly, big railroads seek to concentrate on their high-density core routes while turning to low overhead operators to feed them local traffic. Carriers, including CSX, Burlington Northern Inc. and CNW Corp., have plans to eventually shed an additional 25,000 miles of track.    The short-line buyers have gambled that they could breathe life into such lightdensity trackage by cutting labor costs and boosting service. The new lines generally operate with fewer workers, lower wages and fewer work rules than major railroads, and they usually run trains with two-person crews, compared with four-person crews for the major rail lines. Not surprisingly, rail unions have fiercely resisted creation of the new lines. &quot;Railroads are selling off lines merely to circumvent their collective bargaining agreements,&quot; says Fred Hardin, president of the United Transportation Union.    Rail unions won a major victory last November when a federal court in Pittsburgh blocked the sale of the financially troubled Pittsburgh andamp; Lake Erie Railroad. The decision, affirmed by an appeals court in April, forced the Pandamp;LE to bargain with its unions over plans to cut the line's work force of 700 by 70%.    The decision &quot;put a big wet sponge&quot; over proposed line sales, says Thomas Trantum, former president of the Gulf andamp; Mississippi Railroad. That's because the ruling potentially extends negotiations and reduces labor savings when a major railroad sells a line.    The Pandamp;LE is appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, and other railroads are lobbying Congress for legislation that would get line sales back on track. One bill would free line sales from the Railway Labor Act, which raises the potential for long delays, in exchange for severance payments of as much as $30,000 a person for workers who are displaced by such sales. But railroad officials say line sales aren't likely to resume anytime soon, much to the chagrin of some shippers.    &quot;I hate being in limbo,&quot; says George Keller, a traffic manager of Witco Corp., whose oil refinery in Bradford, Pa., is on a light-density line that CSX seeks to sell to a joint venture of short-line operator Genesee andamp; Wyoming Industries Inc. and Pennsylvania coal interests. The transaction has been blocked since last fall by rail unions' threat to strike CSX.    Mr. Keller expects service and rates to improve once Genesee andamp; Wyoming takes over the line, which extends from Buffalo, N.Y., to Eidenau, Pa. Meanwhile, he worries that CSX is reducing upkeep. &quot;We've had three derailments on the line in the last six months,&quot; says Mr. Keller. &quot;It could be coincidental, but we didn't have many in this area before that.&quot; A CSX spokesman denies that the carrier has deferred maintenance.    Railroad executives say most new lines have proved successful. &quot;What is surprising is not that there are a few failures, but that there are so many successes,&quot; says David Hughes, chairman of Regional Railroads of America, a trade group. He adds that such new lines as MidSouth Rail Corp., Paducah andamp; Louisville Railway Inc. and Wisconsin Central Railroad have increased freight and profits.    Nevertheless, recent failures have sobered some rail officials. &quot;Our dream was to show the railroad industry what could be accomplished through aggressive marketing and enlightened labor agreements,&quot; says John Darling, chairman of Venango. &quot;But the reality has been a disaster.&quot;    Rail executives say Venango paid too high a price for the CMandamp;W and was too highly leveraged. Venango's equity in the new line was only $2.2 million of the $81 million purchase price. But Mr. Darling says the chief problem that drove CMandamp;W into bankruptcy-law proceedings is that IC Industries diverted chemicals and other lucrative traffic onto its own lines.    Gulf andamp; Mississippi, a 713-mile regional line, didn't enter Bankruptcy Court but went through a restructuring before it was sold to MidSouth last April. Mr. Trantum, the line's former president, says the &quot;traffic base wasn't as large as we had thought, and the track was in much worse shape than we expected.&quot;    Mr. Trantum, who was a partner of investment banker L.F. Rothschild Unterberg Towbin in New York before his move into regional railroading, says the dilapidated track averaged a derailment a day. &quot;That really messes up your schedules,&quot; Mr. Trantum says.    ---            Major Pending Rail Acquisitions* SELLER     PURCHASER         PRIMARY LINE SEGMENT     MILES Santa Fe   Toledo, Peoria    Peoria, III - Logansport, Railroad   andamp; Western         Ind.            acquisition Corp.                            170 Chicago andamp;  Lake Superior andamp;   Green Bay, Wis. - North      Lake Michigan     Escanaba, Mich.
