<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-86-0132 </DOCNO><TEXT>Electro-spark deposition (ESD) is a pulsed-arc micro-welding process usingshort-duration, high-current electrical pulsed to deposit an electrodematerial on a metallic substrate. It is one of the few methods availableby which a fused, metallurgically bonded coating can be applied withsuch a low total heat input that the bulk substrate material remainsat or near ambient temperatures. The short duration of the electricalpulse allows an extremely rapid solidification of the deposited materialand results in an exceptionally fine-grained, homogeneous coating thatapproaches an amorphous structure. This structure is believed to contributeto the good tribological and corrosion performance observed for hardsurfacingmaterials used in demanding environments. A brief historical review ofthe process is provided, followed by descriptions of the present state-of-the-art,of the performance and applications of electro-spark deposition coatingsin nuclear and fossil energy environments, and of potential applicationsin development. 23 refs., 23 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
