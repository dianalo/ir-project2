For a cyclic queueing problemwith exponentially distributed service times, a cyclic queueing modelprovides exact solutions in a fraction of the time that simulation takesto produce an approximate solution. The model is applied to an exampleproblem, and the results are validated with simulation. Simulation isused to show that the assumptions of exponentially distributed servicetimes and steady-state are not serious problems. A cyclic queueing modelcan be used to quickly obtain an accurate assessment of the productivityof a shovel-truck system.</TEXT></DOC>
