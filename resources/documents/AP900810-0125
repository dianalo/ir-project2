Two of the allies _ Canada and Belgium _ prepared to announcetheir own contributions to the land force and sea armada organizedby the United States in defense of Saudi Arabia's oilfields. AndWest Germany sent four ships to the Eastern Mediterranean.   However, Manfred Woerner, the NATO secretary-general, announcedafter a four-hour closed meeting with Secretary of State James A.Baker III and 15 other Western foreign ministers: ``Military actionby NATO as such is restricted to its area,'' meaning Europe.   Still, Baker, in a separate news conference, said the UnitedStates, Britain and other nations that have sent forces to theregion will have to coordinate their operations.   If there should be a naval blockade, for example, ``there willhave to be a traffic cop,'' Baker said. ``Someone or somecollection of countries or individuals will have to coordinatethis. That is something that is being considered and beingdiscussed.''   Baker headed back to the United States after the meeting inBrussels. He will meet with President Bush Saturday at thepresident's vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, to report on histrip, which also included a stop in Turkey.   Woerner said the allies by ``full consensus'' had endorsedPresident Bush's military moves in the Persian Gulf and sanctionsagainst Iraq approved by the U.N. Security Council. And theypledged to defend Turkey if attacked by neighboring Iraq. Turkey onThursday informed Baker that U.S. forces could launch attacks fromTurkish bases against Iraq in the event of war.   Baker said Friday at NATO headquarters that the allies had actedwith ``unmistakable resolve and solidarity.''   He noted that Great Britain and France already have announcedthe deployment of forces, and said Germany, Belgium and Canada``gave indications they will have announcements to make in duecourse.''   Later Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said hisnation will send three ships and 800 sailors as its contribution toa multinational force.   A U.S. official traveling with Baker, commenting only oncondition of anonymity, said, ``You will see other allied forces,some of which will be on the ground'' in the Mideast.   Baker had told the foreign ministers at their closed sessionthat Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was a dictator engaged in anunrelenting buildup of missiles and chemical weapons ``far out ofproportion to any conceivable threat.''   Asked at the news conference if he was calling for Saddam'soverthrow, Baker said he was not going to suggest the United Stateswas pursuing such a goal.   ``That's a matter for the people of Iraq to determine; that is,who will constitute their leadership,'' Baker said. ``But I amsuggesting that the entire world community has risen up in almostcomplete unity to condemn the aggression that has taken place byIraq under the leadership of Saddam Hussein.''   Baker went on to condemn as ``beyond all international norms''Iraq's refusal to permit some 3,500 Americans and thousands ofother foreigners to leave the country and Iraqi-held Kuwait.   ``The United States is very disturbed about the restrictions onthe freedom of travel,'' Baker said.   He said most if not all foreigners ``are being prevented fromleaving Iraq and Kuwait against their will, he said.   However, Baker said, since no demand had been made in exchangefor their freedom ``we are not calling them hostages.'' Nor, hesaid, had they been mistreated ``as best we can tell.''   He said diplomatic contacts were continuing in an effort tosecure their freedom.   Baker lauded Spain, Italy and Portugal for letting the UnitedStates use bases to support its deployment of troops to the PersianGulf.   He pointed out that the NATO charter precludes the allies as agroup from undertaking military action in the gulf, an area outsidethe alliance's territory.   However, Woerner said, ``It is very clear that an attack onTurkey would be considered an attack on all (NATO) nations.'' Hesaid, ``We have been able to deal adequately'' with what NATO termsout-of-area operations such as the situation in the gulf.   Woerner said NATO will inform the Warsaw Pact nations of thediscussions on Friday. In recent weeks, Warsaw Pact nations havedesignated their ambassadors to Belgium to act as ``diplomaticliaisons'' with the Western alliance in reply to an invitation todo so issued at last month's NATO summit meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
