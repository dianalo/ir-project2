This rule amends Export Control CommodityNumber (ECCN) 1565A, which controls electronic computers and related equipment,by significantly reducing the restrictions on exports of computers, computerperipherals, and computerized equipment.This revision has resulted from a review of strategic controls maintainedby the U.S. and allied countries through the Coordinating Committee (COCOM).Such multilateral controls restrict the availability of strategic itemsto controlled countries. With the concurrence of the Department of Defense,the Department of Commerce has determined that this rule is necessary toprotect U.S. national interests. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>August 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>For questions of a technical natureregarding equipment controlled for export under ECCN 1565A, call Raj Dheer,Computer Systems Technology Center, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis,Telephone: (202) 377-0708.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This rule significantly reduces exportrestrictions on computers and related equipment classified under ECCN 1565Aon the Commodity Control List. Specifically, it eases licensing standardson exports to controlled countries of lower level computers and computerperipherals, while maintaining restrictions on strategic items such asengineering workstations. An increase in Advisory Note 12 levels, from48 to 78 Mbit/sec., will allow more license approvals for the Soviet Unionunder the ``no exceptions'' policy. Increases in Advisory Note 9, from28 to 43 Mbit/sec., will not only shorten licensing times for controlledcountries, but will increase significantly the range of products eligiblefor General Licenses G-COM and GFW.Advisory Note 17 for the People's Republic of China has been amended topermit the export of digital computers having a total processing data rateof 550 Mbit per second, and increase from the prior level of 285 Mbit persecond. In addition, the bulk sale limit for the export of personal computersand business computers has been increased from 15 Mbit per second to 136Mbit per second (Advisory Note 20 for the People's Republic of China).<ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements</ITAG>1. Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared.2. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule also is exemptfrom the APA requirements because it involves a foreign and military affairsfunction of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does not requirethat this rule be published in proposed form because this rule implementsregulatory changes based on COCOM review. Further, no other law requiresthat a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public commentbe given for this rule.3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.4. This rule contains a collection of information subject to the requirementsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This collection has been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget under control number 0694-0013. Public reporting burden forcomputer export applications is estimated to very from one to five hoursper response, with an average of two and a half hours per response. Thisincludes time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewingthe collection of information. Send commenters regarding the burden estimateor any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestionsfor reducing this burden to the Office of Administration, Bureau of ExportAdministration, Room 3889, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Managementand Budget, Washington, DC 20503.5. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.Accordingly, it is being issued in final form. However, as with other Departmentof Commerce rules, comments from the public are always welcome.
