Chipello   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>06/24/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A7D</SO><RE>FAR EAST (FE)JAPAN (JA)PACIFIC RIM (PRM)</RE><LP>   TOKYO -- Takako Doi, the first woman to head a majorJapanese political party, resigned as chairwoman of Japan'sSocialist Party.   Ms. Doi, who had signaled last month that she might stepdown after five years at the helm of the largest oppositionparty, made her decision official Friday.</LP><TEXT>   Makoto Tanabe, the party's vice chairman and the favoriteof its more moderate members, is considered Ms. Doi's mostlikely successor.   Ms. Doi, a 62-year-old former law professor, took officeat a time when the Socialists were floundering. Herpugnacious speeches and charismatic style caught the public'sfancy. And while the ruling Liberal Democratic Party wasbattered by scandals two years ago, the Socialists scored bigelectoral gains, stirring speculation that they might evengain a share of power.   But the inability of the Socialists to break with theirMarxist roots and adopt policies more in line with mainstreamJapanese attitudes disillusioned many voters. The party'sopinion ratings have slipped badly in the past year, and itsuffered heavy losses in local elections in April.   In the past month, Mr. Tanabe supervised the compilationof a draft reform plan calling for changes in the party'sbasic policies on defense, energy and foreign affairs,including recognition for the first time of the Self-DefenseForces, Japan's armed forces. The plan, approved Thursday bythe party's executive committee, will be submitted to a partyconvention at the end of July.   Ms. Doi will step down at the convention, which willinstall her successor. Should more than one candidate standfor election, a national poll of Socialist party memberswould be held before the convention.   The split between the party's leftists and moderates wassymbolized by its recent decision to change its English nameto the Social Democratic Party of Japan, while continuing tobe known as Shakaito, or Socialist Party, in Japanese. Someanalysts expect the party to splinter, with the moderatespossibly joining forces with other opposition parties.</TEXT></DOC>
