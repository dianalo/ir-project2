Short-selling . . . CopyTele.    For nearly four years now, no other OTC stock has commanded the attention of the short-selling world as CopyTele has. The Huntington Station, N.Y., company, which went public in 1983, is developing a new, flat-panel screen intended to display much clearer computer data and graphics than typical cathode-ray tubes. There is a debate, to say the least, over whether the company will ever achieve its goal.    Diehard short sellers, some holding their short positions since back in 1984, insist the stock, which closed Friday at 10 3/8, up 1/8, will one day be worthless. Short sellers place bets against stocks they feel will tumble by selling borrowed shares, hoping that they can replace them later at cheaper prices. But if a stock turns upward instead, the shorts sometimes stampede to cover their bets, losing money as the rash of buying sends the stock even higher.    And CopyTele's equally avid fans predict that, rather than fizzle, the stock's price will skyrocket -- to, oh, 100 or so. &quot;Seriously, if (the screen) works, it's the next Xerox,&quot; gushes CopyTele lover Bill Dillon, owner of Landmark Investors, a newsletter publisher and money manager in Watertown, Mass.    All of this sounds like a classic bulls vs. bears debate over a speculative stock. Except that in CopyTele's case, the debate has been so long and heated that it's taking on mythic proportions. Recently, many of the longtime foes and friends of the stock have resurfaced to duke it out anew as CopyTele's price -- after sinking as low as 3 3/4 last November and 6 3/4 in February -- once again has started to climb.    CopyTele fans are predicting a &quot;short squeeze&quot; is on the horizon. Yet talk of such a squeeze may be just wishful thinking by CopyTele's ardent backers, distressed by the years of short selling of the stock they support. Few huge short positions have been maintained as long as the one in CopyTele has. Most recently, as of mid-July, the total short position in CopyTele, relative to its average daily trading volume, ranked second on the Nasdaq list. And the size of that position -- 1.3 million shares, up 2% from June -- ranked 14th among 2,510 Nasdaq National Market System stocks listed.    CopyTele is the longest standing OTC short recommendation on the list of Michael Murphy, one of Wall Street's most visible short sellers. The latest issue of Mr. Murphy's Overpriced Stock Service lists CopyTele as ripe for shorting above $7; Mr. Murphy has listed CopyTele since October 1984, longer than any other stock except American Telephone andamp; Telegraph (a New York Stock Exchange issue that Mr. Murphy has been predicting will fall since 1983).    Mr. Murphy's &quot;target price&quot; for CopyTele used to be $1; now it's $0.    In addition to being dubious that CopyTele's technology will ever be brought to market, the main point of Mr. Murphy and other short sellers is this: Based on its current share price, CopyTele has a market value of $112.2 million, even though the company has had no revenue since its inception and just enough net worth to meet Nasdaq listing standards.    &quot;There's nothing going on at CopyTele,&quot; Mr. Murphy says. &quot;As long as the officers want to fund the company out of their pockets, they can keep it alive. That doesn't provide enough cash to sign a serious manufacturing agreement, but if they're having fun being a development-stage company, let them.&quot;    CopyTele officials didn't return phone calls Friday. They've generally avoided speaking to the press, but in the annual let ter to shareholders they called 1987 &quot;a year of substantial achievements&quot; in the development of the flat-panel screen. The achievements include successful testing of a larger experimental model of the screen and several patents, CopyTele said.    The reason stock watchers like Mr. Murphy have renewed their criticism lately is that stock watchers like Landmark's Mr. Dillon have resumed trumpeting it. And Mr. Dillon isn't alone.    Another CopyTele fan is Charles T. Maxwell, vice chairman of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., New York, who's more known for his pronouncements as the firm's senior energy strategist than for his technology-stock picking acumen. Short sellers &quot;have missed some points&quot; about CopyTele, says Mr. Maxwell, who bought the stock at 9 3/4.    Mr. Maxwell is encouraged that other, bigger companies are said to have at least shown an interest in what CopyTele is doing. He says that if the flat panel does work, the &quot;market potential could be enormous.&quot; But even Mr. Maxwell concedes that while he doesn't agree with the short sellers' skepticism, some of their points about the technology and the company &quot;may be logical.&quot;    The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 0.16 to 378.95 on Friday, closing a week in which the index lost 8.76 points, or 2%. With 109.2 million shares traded, Nasdaq is on a pace to average 118 million shares in August, 27% off last year's average of 150 million for the month.    Octel Communications rose 7/8 to 16 5/8. Hewlett-Packard agreed to buy 10% of the company's shares, and also agreed to distribute Octel's voice-processing products in Europe.    Major Video fell 1 1/2 to 13. The company's chief financial officer said the drop might be due to concern that Blockbuster Entertainment's recent 2-for-1 stock split might affect the previously announced stock-swap merger between the two firms. The split won't affect the swap ratio, he said, which applies to pre-split shares. Blockbuster was unchanged at 23 1/4.    Paccar fell 3 1/4 to 33 1/2. A TRW Inc. unit told Paccar to suspend delivery of Paccar's Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks because of potential defects in TRW's power-steering mechanism. The two truck lines represent about 80% of Paccar's sales.    ---   CopyTele   (OTC; Symbol: COPY)   Business: Developing a compact, flat-panel display screen for computer data and graphics   Five year summary:                               LOSS PER   YEAR        NET LOSS           SHARE   1987      $1,401,736           $0.13   1986       1,806,696            0.17   1985       1,745,389            0.16   1984       1,542,384            0.15   1983         976,919            0.13   Second quarter, April 30, 1988:    Net loss: $383,227   Market value: $112.2 million   Average daily trading volume:    53,678 shares   Common shares outstanding: 10.9 million   Stock's 52-week performance:    High $14  Low: $3.375</TEXT></DOC>
