A strong positive correlationexists between total ozone and the distribution of carbon monoxide inthe tropics, indicating that total ozone data can be used for troposphericozone studies. Using ozone profiles derived from the Stratospheric Aerosoland Gas Experiment (SAGE), preliminary findings show enhanced troposphericozone concentrations over Africa and the eastern Atlantic at tropicallatitudes. Other preliminary studies also suggest that Total Ozone MappingSpectrometer (TOMS) data may provide a means of identifying widespreadair pollution episodes over the United States during the summer.</TEXT></DOC>
