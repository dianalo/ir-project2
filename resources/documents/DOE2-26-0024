Only crude oils that emulsified during alkaline floodingwere more efficiently recovered with alcohol. Improved recovery withalcohol was attributed to modification of emulsion characteristics. Alcoholadditives reduced emulsion viscosities and accelerated emulsion coalescencerates, which improved oil bank stability and promoted oil recovery. Oilrecovery efficiency was affected by the chemical structure of the alcohol.Oil recovery generally improved with increasing molecular weight frommethanol to butanol and then decreased for the less water soluble pentanolisomers. Alcohol additives were found to affect the interfacial shearviscosities (IFSV) and interfacial tensions (IFT) of crude oil/alkalinewater systems. Improvements in recovery efficiency were found to corresponddirectly to reduced IFSV. Poor recovery was also related to elevatedinterfacial tensions. 19 refs., 10 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
