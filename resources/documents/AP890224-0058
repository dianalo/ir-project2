About 50 U.S. agents swept down to the north bank of the TijuanaRiver's concrete-lined channel, the San Diego Union quoted U.S.officials as saying, and took about 350 suspected undocumentedaliens into custody.   Meanwhile, officers from city, state and federal policedepartments in Tijuana waited south of the border as hundreds ofpeople fled up the south bank and through holes in the chainlinkborder fence, the paper said Thursday.   Mexican police arrested about 150 suspected alien smugglers anddrug dealers, the paper quoted Capt. Fernando Jimenez of the TijuanaPolice Department as saying.   Authorities carried out the raids near the San Ysidro crossingabout six miles west of the proposed site of a border ditch thatU.S. officials say would help stop illegal border crossings. Theplan has fueled controversy in the United States, offended manyMexicans, and aggravated border relations.   News reports described Thursday's raids as one of the largestsuch operations in recent years. The Mexico-City based Excelciornews service said the raid lasted 45 minutes.   ``There is a lot of bandit activity and drug dealing down on thelevee itself,'' the paper quoted U.S. Border Patrol spokesman MikeGregg as saying.``Once in a while, we gather our strength and run asweep.''   A temporary shortage of U.S. Border Patrol agents has ledincreasing numbers of migrants to cross at the river channel,according to Border Patrol officials.   U.S. authorities found no drugs or weapons, said Frank Wernsing,agent in charge of the Imperial Beach Border Patrol station.   ``We suspect when they realized they were going to be caught,they threw whatever they had on the ground,'' he was quoted by thepaper as saying.   Gregg said Thursday that most of the 350 suspects would beprocessed as undocumented aliens and released in Tijuana overnight.   Jimenez said many of the 150 suspects arrested in Tijuana wereheld by the Federal Judicial Police for questioning on drug charges,the newspaper said.</TEXT></DOC>
