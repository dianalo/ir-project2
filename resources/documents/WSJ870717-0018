Although the dollar never mounted a full-fledged rally, its steady gains throughout yesterday brought it up 1.3% to 150.70 yen in late New York trading from 148.83 a day earlier.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 151.27 yen.    The British pound was even stronger, gaining 1.5% against the yen in trading attributed to rising prices for oil, a major British export. The pound also rose against the dollar.    The dollar rose against most other major currencies but not as much as it did against the yen. The U.S. currency, for example, climbed just 0.5% to 1.8390 West German marks from 1.8293.    Robert A. White, vice president, foreign exchange, at First Interstate Bank of California, Los Angeles, said that yesterday &quot;has to be viewed as the day the dust settled&quot; from the dollar's pounding the day before. Wednesday's fall was set off by news that the U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened in May, contrary to the forecasts of many economists and analysts.    After the trade news sent speculative dollar-holders stampeding out of the market, the flow of investments from Japan that had been supporting the dollar's rise this summer took over again and picked the currency back up yesterday, dealers said.    &quot;The trade number didn't affect the flow of funds from Japan to the U.S.,&quot; Mr. White said. &quot;The sell-off of the speculative side of the market simply allowed the side with a natural need for dollars to buy the currency at a nice price.&quot;    Japanese investors are believed to have increased their purchases of U.S. securities considerably in recent weeks, especially of long-term government bonds. With yields of more than 8%, these bonds are earning about four percentage points more than similar Japanese investments.    Dealers also attributed some of the dollar's strength against the yen to higher world oil prices and increased Persian Gulf tensions. Japan must import nearly all of its oil, and much of it comes from the Persian Gulf area.    Britain's currency, meanwhile, benefited from those same factors. While the dollar rose against all other major European currencies, the pound advanced to $1.6296 from $1.6255. But most of the activity in sterling was against the Japanese currency, as the pound rallied to 245.58 yen from 241.92.    &quot;Geopolitics and oil prices both seem to impact those countries in opposite directions,&quot; Trevor W. Woodland, vice president, foreign exchange, at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago, said. &quot;If you don't like the yen, why not take a position against the yen with a currency that's most likely to benefit from any oil-price rise?&quot;    Despite the dollar's rebound, dealers continued to express doubt that the currency will make any sustained gains, citing the U.S.'s trade and budget deficits and sluggish economy.    &quot;I don't see a groundswell of corporate America stepping up to buy dollars for their needs for the next year,&quot; Douglas Madison, a corporate trader at BankAmerica International in New York, said. &quot;The market is going to be happy to sell dollars whenever we get up to 1.85 marks or 152 yen.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $1 an ounce to $454.20 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.1 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $452.70 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Thursday, July 16, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
