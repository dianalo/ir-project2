YangStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/11/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><TEXT>   The eyes of Texas are fixed firmly upon financial-institution regulators in Washington.    And with good reason. Last year, the Lone Star state had the dubious honor of leading the nation in bank failures. Its thrift industry is reeling from the state's real estate collapse. And federal regulators are cracking down on some of the state's most troubled institutions.    But not since the late Rep. Wright Patman, the populist from the Texas town of Patman's Switch and scourge of bankers who wielded the House Banking Committee gavel, have Texans held so much sway over banking and thrift industry regulation. The vice president, the Treasury secretary, the comptroller of the currency, a new member of the Federal Reserve Board, the speaker of the House and members of the banking panels in both chambers of Congress are Texans. &quot;They've really taken over,&quot; says one savings and loan association lobbyist.    House Speaker James Wright flexed a little bit of that Texas muscle recently by temporarily sidelining legislation aimed at raising new funds for the nearly depleted Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the insurance fund that protects thrift deposits. Before any bill to bolster the FSLIC moves to a vote, Mr. Wright wants his friends who run Texas Sandamp;Ls to get a few things settled first.    Texas thrifts complain that federal regulators are demanding that they substantially write off all or part of some $30 billion in real estate loans almost immediately because borrowers are defaulting and loan values are sliding. Write-offs of that magnitude could bankrupt most Texas Sandamp;Ls, which already have little or no capital. If they press this, &quot;they could close every bank and every Sandamp;L in the state of Texas tomorrow,&quot; says James B. &quot;Boots&quot; Reeder, chairman and chief executive officer of Bright Banc Savings Association, among the largest Sandamp;Ls in the state. &quot;They're not allowing us any time to solve our problems,&quot; he adds.    After Mr. Wright's move last week, Democrats on the House Banking panel decided to send a team of committee investigators to Texas to look into the thrift executives' complaints. In the meantime, Texas Republican Rep. Steve Bartlett, a Banking panel member, is readying a bill that would require federal regulators to ease up on ailing thrifts in Texas and other depressed areas.    No one disputes that the FSLIC needs more money. It currently has reserves of only $1.9 billion to cover insured deposits of $890 billion in the nation's 3,000 federally insured thrifts. That is the lowest ratio of reserves to deposits ever. Also pending are requests for more than $2 billion in loans to troubled thrifts.    Worse, the projected cost of taking care of the troubled institutions is $19.5 billion, according to Edwin Gray, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which controls the fund. Those thrifts, including several in Texas and the rest of the Southwest, are estimated to be losing more than $6 million a day, or almost $2.2 billion annually.    The legislation that Mr. Wright has tied up provides for a five-year financing plan designed to raise as much as $25 billion to bail out the FSLIC. But thrift executives worry that once the FSLIC gets hold of that amount of money, it won't hesitate to close the Sandamp;Ls with hopeless real estate loan troubles but will also close other thrifts that believe they may be able to save themselves if given some breathing room, or what bankers call &quot;forbearance.&quot;    Already, some Sandamp;Ls accuse federal regulators of bullying management into lending restrictions and other management changes. Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox says they have used &quot;Gestapo tactics&quot; against thrift executives by forcing them to write down loans or give up their jobs. &quot;They have really engaged in coercive-type tactics,&quot; he says, and he is threathening to sue the federal regulators.    Roy G. Green, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank in Dallas, which supervises Texas Sandamp;Ls, says Mr. Mattox is misinformed. &quot;We would welcome the opportunity to discuss with Attorney General Mattox the process of supervision, monitoring and examinations,&quot; in Texas, Mr. Green said in a statement.    Mr. Green also said that thrift regulators are willing to ease up on some Texas Sandamp;Ls that are &quot;hard hit by external factors, including problems of economic conditions that weren't of the institution's making.&quot; He added, &quot;We view our responsibility as one of supportive supervision in which we work with management and the directors with as much flexibility as the regulatory process will allow.&quot;    But a spokeswoman for the Home Loan Bank in Dallas says that for those institutions &quot;that have been poorly managed or mismanaged, those institutions should expect aggressive action&quot; by regulators once the FSLIC is flush with funds. &quot;That is what Congress chartered us to do,&quot; she adds. It might not mean an institution will be closed, but she said some institutions could be taken over in transactions aided with the FSLIC's new funds.    Many Texas thrifts say they need special considerations because of the real estate &quot;depression&quot; in the Southwest. They want any legislation bailing out the FSLIC to include provisions that would throw out federal rules requiring troubled thrifts to make a two-step write-down immediately on sour real estate loans. The &quot;double hit,&quot; as Sandamp;L executives call it, puts a big dent in the capital balance institutions need to remain solvent and exposes them to further crackdowns by thrift regulators.    What's more, they want Congress to force thrift regulators to use a more liberal real estate appraisal method that takes into account a possible rebound in real estate values in the next few years.    Last year, Mr. Wright, who was then the majority leader, held up the FSLIC's funding bill until he won assurances from Mr. Gray that the additional funds provided by the bill wouldn't be used to close a large number of Texas institutions. In late January, Rep. Wright had House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand St Germain (D., R.I.), who supports Mr. Gray, and 11 other important Democratic members of the committee -- most of them foes of Mr. Gray -- in for lunch to discuss the FSLIC legislation. At that session, according to one participant, &quot;there was a sense that we ought to take the bill off the fast track and give everybody an opportunity to take a look at it a little bit more.&quot;    Rep. St Germain had wanted to move the legislation quickly through the House. A subcommittee of which Mr. St Germain is chairman was to have approved it last week and sent it to the full committee for a vote this week.    But after lunch with the speaker, Rep. St Germain postponed the subcommittee session and scheduled a private meeting of all the committee's Democrats last week. At that caucus, which lasted more than two hours, the lawmakers agreed to send committee investigators to Texas.    They also decided to hold more hearings on the FSLIC legislation. Among the issues they will look into: allowing for a regional forbearance plan, under which the Bank Board would relax capitalization requirements for institutions while allowing them to write off losses on diminished assets over a longer period, and the question of fees charged thrifts if they leave the FSLIC for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures both bank and thrift deposits.    That Rep. Wright got his way with Rep. St Germain has much to do with the Rhode Island lawmaker's weakened position. The House Ethics Committee is expected to continue an investigation into whether Rep. St Germain violated House rules in various financial dealings that made him a millionaire. And Mr. Wright has yet to decide who will be the new chairman of the Ethics panel. Mr. St Germain has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and says that when the House probe is completed he expects to be cleared.    Rep. St Germain is also eager to improve relations with his House colleagues. He is brusque and imperious, bullying and demeaning to those who oppose him. He often makes crucial moves without consulting committee members. Dissatisfaction with Rep. St Germain led 70 House Democrats to vote against returning him to the chairmanship of the Banking Committee, even though there wasn't anyone openly challenging him.    Whatever the final outcome between regulators and lawmakers, many Texas thrift executives concede that regulatory relief won't cure the sickest Sandamp;Ls. &quot;We will admit there are hopelessly insolvent thrifts,&quot; says W.W. &quot;Bo&quot; McAllister, chairman of San Antonio Savings Association and president of the Texas Savings and Loan League. &quot;We want something along the lines of forbearance,&quot; for some troubled loans, he says, &quot;but not something that saves every institution. That just isn't possible.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
