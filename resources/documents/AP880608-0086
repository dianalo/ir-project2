In Seoul, troopers firing tear gas broke up a rally.   National Police Headquarters said tens of thousands of riotpolice would block roads to the North Korean border to prevent themarch Friday. Riot police began surrounding colleges today in Seoulas security forces went on top alert.   Riot police in green combat fatigues and black, visored helmetsfired volleys of tear gas when several hundred students at YonseiUniversity tried to march into the street after a rally for themarch.   A few students hurled rocks and a handful of firebombs, but themarchers were quickly driven back into the campus by the 4,000 riotpolice surrounding the school.   Students yelling anti-American slogans staged a rally at nearbyMongji University to prepare for the march. Speakers denounced theUnited States, claiming it enforces partition of the peninsula.   ``Drive out Yankees who enforce the partition of our land,''students shouted as they shot clenched fists into the air.   Hundreds of riot police surrounded the school and plainclothespolice officers chased students trying to reach the campus for therally.   Radical leaders have called for up to 40,000 students to rallyat Yonsei Thursday for an overnight vigil before the 30-mile marchto the border north of Seoul. Radicals deny they are pro-NorthKorean, but insist on immediate reunification of the Korean people.   Police said today the school would be completely surrounded tostop the march. They also warned that campuses would be raided todetain radical leaders before the march.   Riot police also stepped up security around government buildingsand U.S. diplomatic facilities in case of student attacks if themarch is blocked. Hundreds of riot police guarded the U.S. Embassy.   Yonsei University officials were considering installing nets tostop students committing suicide by jumping off buildings. Somestudents have threatened to kill themselves if the march isblocked. There have been three anti-government protest suicidessince May 15.   Radical students plan to march to the border truce site ofPanmunjom to meet with North Korean students and clear the way forreunification of the peninsula, divided since 1945.   The government has banned the march as a threat to nationalsecurity. Government officials say the radicals will play into thehands of the communist north.   President Roh Tae-woo met with top officials today to reviewplans to stop the march, but no details were released. UnificationMinister Lee Hong-koo, in a meeting with student leaders, refusedto reconsider the ban on the march.   Opposition leaders called on the students today to call offplans for the march, saying it lacked national support. They urgedstudents and government officials to hold talks.   ``There is no mature consensus on national reunfication,''opposition leaders Kim Dae-jung, Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pilsaid in a statement after meeting.   Many South Koreans oppose the students, though most peoplesupport reunification of the peninsula. But most people in thesouth fear the hostile north is determined to conquer the wholepeninsula.   The two Koreas are bitter foes and the north has often attackedthe south. North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to trigger theKorean War.</TEXT></DOC>
