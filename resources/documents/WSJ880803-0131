The move wasn't entirely unexpected. The NASD, which operates the over-the-counter market, long has been outspoken in its opposition to market-closing mechanisms. Last month it also issued a report criticizing the notion of smoothing market volatility by interrupting trading.    But the board's decision to oppose trading halts as a matter of policy does raise questions about the future of the trading limits jointly proposed by the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange last month, a week before the NASD vote. Introduction of those circuit breakers is contingent upon, among other things, the adoption of similar market-closing mechanisms by all domestic markets.    As previously reported, the Big Board and the Merc proposed to slow trading when the biggest stock-index futures contract is down an equivalent of 96 points of the Dow Jones Industrial Average during a day, and to halt trading when the Dow falls 250 points and again when it falls 400 points.    A spokesman for the Big Board said that if the NASD doesn't like trading halts, it should suggest some alternative means of addressing investors' concerns. He said the New York Stock Exchange continues to support the proposals that it and the Merc made last month. But he added, &quot;The proposal can't go forward without the participation of all markets, because to do so would disadvantage and confuse the investing public.&quot;    A Merc spokesman said his exchange continues to support its proposals and &quot;hopefully will work them out with everyone.&quot; But if that doesn't happen, he said, &quot;our board will have to review our options.&quot;    The NASD vote also makes explicit the division within the securities industry over the value of circuit breakers, and so prevents the industry from presenting regulators and Congress with a united front on market changes in the wake of the crash last October.    NASD President Joseph Hardiman emphasized that the board wasn't actually voting on the Big Board/Merc proposal, which hasn't yet been submitted to other exchanges. &quot;It was a vote against the concept of market trading halts,&quot; he said. &quot;Basically, our board feels that the concept of marketwide trading halts based upon a predetermined formula is the wrong approach to either restoring investor confidence or curbing market volatility.&quot;    But Mr. Hardiman said it appears likely that when the board does consider the Big Board/Merc proposal, it will vote against it. &quot;Unless we're strongly convinced that the proposal has merits we haven't seen yet, our position will continue to be opposed to formula circuit breakers,&quot; he said.    Instead, he said, the board wants the NASD to be able to consider market closings on a case-by-case basis.    As a practical matter, Mr. Hardiman conceded, the over-the-counter market is unlikely to remain open to an avalanche of sell orders when all other stock markets are closed. He said there could be a situation in which some exchanges had interrupted trading, while others, such as the regional stock markets, remained open. In general, he concluded, &quot;the pressure should be on us to keep markets open and functioning, not to close markets.&quot;    The SEC, which must approve the Big Board/Merc proposal, generally endorses the idea of circuit breakers. SEC member Edward Fleischman said yesterday that he especially likes the idea of predetermined halts in trading. &quot;I think it's better that everybody knows what the rules of the game are,&quot; he said.    Another SEC member, Joseph Grundfest, added that as a practical matter, he doubts whether the NASD's opposition to trading halts would mean much during a crash. &quot;If it's the type of situation where if it's a repeat of Oct. 19th, he (Mr. Hardiman) probably won't want to be the only guy on that raft out in the middle of the ocean,&quot; he said.    But Brandon Becker, an official in the SEC's market-regulation division, took a conciliatory approach to the NASD vote, saying, &quot;We understand their concerns, and continue to discuss with the NASD how they might be addressed.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
