A formalized approach to the modelling of productionsystems, called Multilevel Flow Modelling, is described. A MFM modelspecifies plant control requirements and the associated need for plantinformation and provide a consistent context for the interpretation ofreal time plant signals in diagnosis of malfunctions. The use of MFMmodels as a basis for functional design of the plant instrumentationsystem is outlined, and the use of knowledge Based (Expert) Systems forthe design of man-machine interfaces is mentioned. Such systems wouldallow an active user participation in diagnosis and thus provide thebasis for cooperative problem solving. 14 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
