In a short answer to a reader's question, the official CommunistParty newspaper said Voice of America did not lie when it reportedthe pessimistic economic projections given by NATO official HenningWaggoner.   But Pravda said the conclusions in the report were ``onWaggoner's conscience.''   Pravda summarized the NATO report, saying it projected no morethan 2 percent economic growth per year and a widening economic gapbetween East and West until well into the next century.   ``The system's deficiencies are so obvious that (the SovietUnion) has no choice but to continue reforms. This significantlyreduces its opportunities to use national funds for militaryaffairs,'' Pravda said in explaining Waggoner's stand.   Pravda said the official recommended against any Western aid tothe Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
