Though the rail workers, represented by nine separate unions, are in a legal position to strike, talks are continuing with the railways. Negotiations are being conducted with the help of a Canadian government-appointed mediator. The nine unions have been in a legal strike position since Tuesday, when delays imposed under Canadian labor law ran out.    Details of the new offer weren't disclosed. The railways have been seeking a wage freeze, lower wages for starting employees, and other concessions rejected by the unions. The previous contract expired Dec. 31. The unions have been seeking a 5% wage raise in each of two years, more job security and guarantees against subcontracting.    As the talks continued, unauthorized strikes hit operations at state-owned Canadian National both here and in Toronto. About 1,100 workers at the railway's Montreal repair shops went on strike as did 100 workers at a container terminal. About 300 workers also struck a repair facility and container operation near Toronto.    A Canadian National spokesman said the walkouts had slowed some of its operations in the two cities but that conditions were normal in the rest of the country.    The Associated Railway Unions, which negotiates for the nine unions, said the strikes were unauthorized and asked its members to return to work. &quot;We have the right to strike but we haven't authorized it,&quot; said Armand Passaretti, chairman of the union group.    Some participants in the strikes are members of a group of other rail unions that aren't yet in a legal strike position. A Canadian National spokesman said the railway was seeking cease-and-desist orders from the Canadian Labor Relations against three of those unions involved in the walkouts.    A CP Rail spokesman said its operations were continuing normally. </TEXT></DOC>
