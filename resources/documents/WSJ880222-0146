Secretary of State George Shultz is in Moscow today hoping to hammer out details of a withdrawal plan that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev says could bring 115,000 troops home over 10 months starting May 15. But skeptics fear that the Reagan administration, eager to see a Soviet retrenchment, might give the Soviets too many concessions or even fall into a Moscow-set trap.    American supporters of the Afghan resistance worry that Moscow wants to leave a disarmed resistance to face a well-equipped Afghan puppet army after Moscow's withdrawal. They say the Kremlin, hoping to shift attention from Moscow's unsuccessful occupation, has decided that it is better to provoke fighting among factions of the Afghan resistance instead of assisting the creation of a representative government that is likely to reflect the country's bitterness toward Moscow.    &quot;It is conceivable that Gorbachev is trying to transform his problem in Afghanistan into our problem,&quot; warns Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's national security adviser at the time of the 1979 Soviet invasion.    The agreement so far apparently calls for the Soviets to start withdrawing 60 days after the Afghan and Pakistani governments sign a United Nations-brokered agreement in Geneva. The Geneva talks restart March 2. The Soviets have privately agreed to withdraw half their troops in the first three months. The U.N. pact ensures monitoring of the withdrawal, Afghanistan's neutrality, nonintervention by the superpowers and the return of three million refugees to Afghanistan.    Critics of the agreement have two major concerns. The first is that the U.S. will end support to the resistance as soon as the Soviets start withdrawing their forces, and the second is that the agreement lacks any provision for an interim government that would incorporate the resistance.    The first concern arises from a 1985 U.S. suggestion that it would cease supporting the resistance at the beginning of a Soviet withdrawal. &quot;We cannot accept the stipulation that terminates our assistance to the Afghans at the start of the Soviet withdrawal,&quot; Mr. Brzezinski insists, noting that the Soviets still would have a right to arm their Afghan allies. Despite the earlier U.S. position, administration officials say Secretary Shultz's primary message to Moscow this week will be that Washington insists on its right to continue arming the resistance until the Soviets stop supplying their Afghan allies.    Administration officials don't believe the U.S. should quickly dismantle the infrastructure for supporting the guerrillas, as demanded by the Soviets, unless Moscow also takes apart its Afghan air bases and other military facilities.    The second concern, lack of a government that represents all Afghans, is a more troublesome issue for the U.S. Pakistan insists on formation of a coalition in Afghanistan before it signs the Geneva agreement. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the parties in the U.N. negotiations, and Pakistan is the guerrillas' primary conduit of supplies.    Without an interim government, Pakistan argues that civil war and chaos could follow Soviet departure. That would make it impossible for the three million refugees living in Pakistan to return home. The Pakistanis fear Afghanistan would become their Lebanon, a neighboring country whose violence overflows its borders, and that the resistance could become their Palestinians, a permanent refugee group that feeds domestic instability. Such unrest would benefit Moscow and India, Pakistan argues.    Secretary Shultz will argue to the Soviets that cooperating in forming an interim government would help avoid bloodshed and ease reconstruction of the country. But the U.S. doesn't want to hold up withdrawal for such an agreement. The problem is that the U.S. could be bogged down in complicated negotiations among Afghan groups.    If such talks on an interim government fail, which is likely, considering the history of tribal animosity in the country, it would make it easier for the Soviets to back out of withdrawal and blame the U.S., the Pakistanis and the resistance.    &quot;We may be falling into a very major political trap if we ourselves link Soviet departure to the creation of a transitional regime,&quot; Mr. Brzezinski says. </TEXT></DOC>
