In another apparent boost to the beleaguered premier, leaders ofthe national trade union federation Wednesday refused to demandMikulic's resignation, Belgrade radio reported. It said unionleaders decided to withhold their judgement until they review thepremier's performance in January.   In the past month, the government has come under increasingattack from the press, which blames Mikulic's economic policies forthe 250 annual inflation rate, the 15 percent unemployment and asharp drop in living standards.   The country this year registered more than 1,000 strikes byworkers protesting their plummeting buying power.   On Tuesday, more than 1,200 railroad workers walked off theirjobs in Slovenia to demand pay increases and the resignation of thepremier. The strike caused major disruptions in rail traffic, andrailway officials brought in engineers from other parts of thecountry to break the strike, according to media reports.
