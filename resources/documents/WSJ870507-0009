In a formal statement to Congress on his programs to limit the growing U.S. reliance on imported oil, the president proposed minor changes in two tax laws and said he is lowering the minimum bids for offshore oil leases.    The balance of his legislatively required statement was a repetition of past positions on various energy-related subjects. Environmental groups and oil-industry backers alike complained that the proposals wouldn't help much. &quot;This is tinkering at the edges,&quot; said Eli Bergman, executive director of Americans for Energy Independence. &quot;It really doesn't address the issue.&quot;    The American Petroleum Institute, the leading oil-industry trade group, called the announcement &quot;disappointing.&quot; It said the nation needs &quot;actions that would directly stimulate domestic oil and gas exploration and development,&quot; such as stronger tax incentives.    The president's lack of support for an oil-import fee or major oil tax breaks is likely to doom congressional efforts to win passage for either. Like the administration and the nation as a whole, Congress is deeply divided over what to do about reliance on imports, which currently fill almost 40% of U.S. oil needs.    The news also came as a disappointment to oil patch lawmakers, many of whom support a fee on oil imports in order to prop up the price of domestic oil. And it was a setback for Energy Secretary John Herrington, who advocated major new tax breaks for oil exploration, and Interior Secretary Donald Hodel, who has sought strong administration action and warned that some kind of oil crisis may be as little as two years away.    In his message to the Congress, Mr. Reagan repeated his commitments to decontrol natural gas prices, repeal the windfall oil-profit tax, open federal lands to the oil and gas industry, and ensure the growth of the nuclear power industry. But his efforts in these areas have been hampered by congressional and public opposition, and the American Petroleum Institute said these proposals &quot;fall short&quot; of what is needed.    Still, the president called his proposals &quot;important steps toward ensuring that our nation has a strong domestic oil and gas industry and substantial protection against oil-supply interruptions. &quot;    Secretary Herrington said the president's recommendationsrecognize the &quot;seriousness of the problems&quot; presented by thedecline of the U.S. oil industry and made &quot;importantprogress&quot; toward solving them. Still, he conceded that they&quot;reflect a reasonable compromise between the need to balanceenergy security considerations with budgetary constraints andthe goals of the president's tax reform.&quot;   It is understood the White House budget office opposed costly tax incentives and that Treasury Secretary James Baker didn't want to reopen the tax code so soon after last year's enactment of a major tax bill.    The president's statement supported increasing the limit on percentage depletion tax allowances to 100% of the net income of a well from 50%. Under current rules, independent oil producers can deduct 15% of the value of oil production, up to the 50% net-income limit. An oil-industry tax expert said changing the limit wouldn't help many U.S. oil men who are going broke at today's oil prices. He said, &quot;100% of zero isn't any more than 50% of zero.&quot;    Mr. Reagan also proposed repealing the rule that bars independents from taking a percentage depletion on oil from properties they obtained from integrated oil companies.    Mr. Reagan said he is &quot;prepared to support&quot; buying 100,000 barrels of oil a day for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, provided that Congress finds the money for that by cutting some other program. His fiscal 1988 budget calls for 35,000 barrels a day.    Finally, he said he is lowering the minimum bid on all offshore oil leases to $25 from $150 an acre. The Interior Department already did that in its April 21 sale of tracts in the central Gulf of Mexico that are more than 400 meters deep. </TEXT></DOC>
