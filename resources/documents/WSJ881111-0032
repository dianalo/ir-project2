The flat performance of the Labor Department's producer price index for finished goods, following a rise of 0.4% in September, was the best news for inflation fighters since the index fell 0.2% in February.    The report comes amid worry by some Federal Reserve officials and many private analysts that the economy is expanding too rapidly to keep prices in line. Those worries were bolstered by the department's report last week showing stronger job growth in October than expected.    But yesterday's price report, while representing only a single month, gave no indication that inflation is a growing threat.    &quot;The numbers are exceptionally solid,&quot; said Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. &quot;That's good news, particularly in light of the robust economy. There's no evidence of inflationary psychology in the decisions of businessmen or consumers.&quot;    Among other factors, prices excluding food and energy, which many economists consider a good indication of underlying inflation, fell 0.1% last month after rising 0.6% in September. Capital equipment prices declined 0.3% after an 0.8% September rise. Prices of intermediate goods, which require some additional processing, were unchanged after a 0.4% increase, and crude-goods prices fell 0.1% after a 0.5% drop.    Evelina Tainer, senior domestic economist at First National Bank of Chicago, said, &quot;Across the board the figures were favorable. You can't point to any one sector and say this was really bad.&quot;    Food prices, after increasing 1.2% in September, declined 0.1% last month, a further suggestion that the effects of the drought may be less than was once feared. Energy prices, which dropped 3.3% in September, rose 0.3% last month as natural gas prices jumped 4.6%. Gasoline prices were unchanged and home heating oil costs declined, however, and many economists expect a moderation in energy prices in the next couple of months. Crude and intermediate energy prices fell.    In other areas, prices fell for cars, household appliances, over-the-counter drugs, sporting and athletic goods and children's clothing. Prices rose for household furniture, alcoholic beverages and cosmetics, among other items.    Several economists cautioned against expecting such price moderation to continue. Ms. Tainer, for example, said high factory operating rates suggest that capital equipment prices are likely to increase in coming months. Moreover, one month of good news may not be enough for the Fed, which might push up short-term interest rates as an anti-inflation move if there are further indications of rapid economic growth.    The figures are adjusted for seasonal variation. Before adjustment the finished-good index rose 0.6% from September and stood 2.9% above a year earlier.    Here are the Labor Department's producer price indexes (1982=100) for October , before seasonal adjustment, and the percentage changes from October 1987.
