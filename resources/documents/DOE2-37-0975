Furthermore two effectsof these mixing processes are discussed in detail on the basis of newstellar evolution sequences for 15 and 30 Solar mass stars: the density-and temperature structure of massive stars in the core helium burningphase is shown to depend critically on the assumptions about semiconvectionand core size, and the nucleosynthesis in the final phase of core heliumburning is found to be highly sensitive to the rate of mixing above thefully convective core.</TEXT></DOC>
