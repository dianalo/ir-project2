U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene granted a petition bylawyers for Poindexter, who was Reagan's national security adviser.In the past, the lawyers have said they want portions of Reagan'sdiaries and notes he took at key meetings with Poindexter.   The judge did not say how narrowly or broadly drawn the subpoenawas.   In a two-paragraph order, Greene said Poindexter ``may serveupon former President Reagan and upon the archivist of the UnitedStates the subpoenas ... submitted to the court.   ``The return date for those subpoenas shall be Nov. 22, 1989,''said Greene.   The judge ruled last month that Poindexter is entitled tosubpoena ``specific, relevant documents'' bearing on the criminalcharges against him.   ``I have no comment,'' Theodore Olson, a lawyer for the formerpresident, said in response to Greene's order.   Reagan's lawyers could file a motion to quash the subpoena.   Responding to shouted questions as he was entering a limousinein Cincinnati, the former president replied: ``Cases like thatbefore the law, I don't comment.''   Poindexter, who is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 22, is underindictment on two counts of making false statements to Congress,two counts of obstruction of Congress and one count of conspiracy.   This is the first time in the Iran-Contra scandal that a judgehas approved a subpoena for documents from Reagan. Earlier thisyear, U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell had quashed asubpoena for documents sought from Reagan in the case againstOliver North.   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said ``we are in theprocess of reviewing'' Greene's order ``to determine what action weshould take, if any.''   The department will examine the Reagan subpoena in light of the1974 Supreme Court ruling on the Watergate tapes, said a JusticeDepartment source, speaking on condition of anonymity.   During the Watergate scandal, the court ruled that PresidentNixon had to comply with a subpoena from the special prosecutor toproduce tape recordings of 64 conversations. The court ruled thatneed for the evidence in a criminal case outweighed the president'srights in the matter.   To date, the only information supplied from Reagan's diary ornotes in the Iran-Contra affair were portions of the diary shown tothe staff of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh. Walsh's staff wasallowed to see the diary portions and take notes on them after theywere reviewed by White House legal counsel and deemed to besufficiently relevant to allow investigators to examine them.   Poindexter, in support of his request, said he met ``daily,frequently alone'' with the president during the Iran-Contra affair.   The two men, according to Poindexter, talked of the role ofRichard Secord as a middleman in the transfer of arms to Iran andalso discussed the accuracy of a chronology prepared by North andreviewed by Poindexter.   Poindexter now is accused of lying to Congress in connectionwith the chronology.   The chronology said that no official in the U.S. governmentlearned before January 1986 that Hawk missiles had been shipped toIran in November 1985 with assistance from the CIA.   The shipment, overseen by North, who kept Poindexter apprised ofits progress, occurred without the existence of a presidentialfinding as required by law. Reagan signed a retroactive finding themonth after the Hawks were transported to Iran.   Poindexter has made Reagan central to his defense by suggestingthat the president personally authorized the alleged criminalactivities of which he stands accused.   For example, Poindexter said that Reagan took notes ofdiscussions focusing on how to respond to congressional inquiriesabout whether the administration was secretly assisting the Contrasduring a congressional ban on the use of appropriations byintelliegence agencies to aid the rebels.   ``We believe the president's notes will show (that he held)discussions with Admiral Poindexter, first about letters that weresent by Congress and the appropriateness of any response,'' one ofPoindexter's lawyers said in September.   Poindexter is accused of obstructing Congress by denying thatthe administration was aiding the Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
