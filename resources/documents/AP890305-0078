U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson issued a temporaryrestraining order against three major rail lines that carry 320,000commuters daily between New York City and New Jersey, Long Islandand northern suburbs.   The threat of confrontations with rail workers and commutersnarls evaporated when the International Association of Machiniststhen said it would not picket any of the nation's 12 commuterrailroads or Amtrak.   ``The IAM will not set up picket lines at any rail carrier'sproperty at this time,'' union vice president John Peterpaul said.``We don't want any IAM member or members of other unions to violatethe court's order or put themselves in a position that couldjeopardize their jobs.''   But Peterpaul he said the Machinists will file an emergencyappeal of the judge's order Monday.   ``When the court upholds our position we are prepared toestablish appropriate picket lines,'' he said.   Secondary boycotts on air and rail travel are legal under the1926 National Railway Labor Act but injunctions may be sought on thegrounds the actions would widely disrupt public transportationservice.   ``There should be no problems. We're not going to violate theorder,'' said Ed Yule, general chairman of the United TransportationUnion, which represents conductors and train workers on the LongIsland Rail Road and Metro-North Commuter Railroad in New York.   The 41,000-member Air Line Pilots Association on Sundayreiterated a pledge to begin a rule-book slowdown at 6 a.m. Tuesdaythat could delay every flight in the country.   ``We see major disruptions and major changes in the whole airsystem as a result of the Eastern shutdown,'' association presidentHenry Duffy said in Washington.   The move by the Machinists came after officials in major citiesset up contingency plans to brace for possible secondary strikes.   _In Boston, officials had readied 150 public and private buses incase of a sympathy strike that would affect service to 35,000suburban commuters.   The Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority asked commuters tocarpool, stagger work hours and rely on the buses only as a lastresort because they could not accommodate the full load.   _Amtrak, which carries 33,000 passengers daily in theBoston-Washington corridor and 28,000 elsewhere, said it would add12 high-speed trains between Washington and New York daily if nosympathy strikes occurred tohelp compensate for reduced service onEastern's Northeast shuttle.   _In Philadelphia, a transport union official said members wouldobey an injunction against a sympathy strike in the city. Localpolice had been asked to enforce the order in case of pickets inPhiladelphia and its suburbs.   _In Baltimore, a computerized telephone operator for MARC, thecommunter rail between Baltimore and Washington, had warned callersof delays because of possible secondary strikes.   _Greyhound Lines Inc. said 200 additional buses were on stand-byon the the Eastern seaboard. Greyhound said it was planning specialnon-stop shuttle service between Boston and New York, New York andWashington, and Philadelphia and Washington.   The order signed by the federal judge in New York covers theLIRR, Metro-North and New Jersey Transit. It lasts until a hearingWednesday.   LIRR spokesman Al Cannizzaro said ``we expect our employees toreport to work so that we can provide normal service to ourpassengers.''</TEXT></DOC>
