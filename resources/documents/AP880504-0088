They said Interior Minister Charles Pasqua used a specialadministrative procedure that does not require judicial approval toexpel Omran Adham, who is said to be close to President Hafez Assadof Syria.   In an interview today with Radio Monte Carlo, Pasqua neitherconfirmed nor denied the expulsion, but said:   ``We cannot accept anyone of foreign nationality in ourterritory who, by his actions, hampers the efforts of the Frenchgovernment and risks causing harm to those who are being heldhostage.''   Pasqua said Adham had not served as an ``intermediary for theFrench government since March 1986'' in negotiations aimed atfreeing French hostages.   Adham left France on Tuesday by plane for another Europeancapital after the expulsion order was signed by Pasqua, the sourcessaid.   He has a Syrian diplomatic passport but is not on the officialdiplomatic list issued by the Foreign Ministry. Adham has lived inParis for 11 years and his wife and four children are French.   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Pasqua,who is close to Premier Jacques Chirac, was annoyed by Adham'sstatements to the media about an imminent release of Frenchhostages just before the first round of presidential elections onApril 24.   A close aide to Pasqua, Jean Charles Marchiani, made severaltrips to the Middle East in the weeks before athe voting to try toobtain the release of the hostages, who are being held by thepro-Iranian Islamic Jihad.   The French hostages are two diplomats, Marcel Fontaine, 45, andMarcel Carton, 62, and journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann, 44. IslamicJihad has claimed it killed a fourth French hostage, but his bodyhas not been found.   French press reports said release of the hostages before theApril 24 voting was imminent. They said Pasqua's efforts to freethem were designed to boost Chirac's chances in the presidentialcampaign.   Chirac did not do as well as expected in the first round ofvoting and now faces President Francois Mitterrand in a runoffballot Sunday.   Both Chirac and Mitterrand have said they have worked togetherclosely to free the hostages.   Adham's last known trip to Beirut occurred April 2.   The French hostages are among 22 foreigners, including nineAmericans, missing in Lebanon. Terry Anderson, 40, chief MiddleEast correspondent of The Associated Press, was abducted March 16,1985 and is the longest held.</TEXT></DOC>
