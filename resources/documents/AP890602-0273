Analysts said the sharp rise in prices took them by surprise,given the bearish undertone in the market in recent days asinvestors nervously awaited OPEC's mid-year meeting.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark crude oil grade, ended 33 centshigher at $20.14 a barrel. The August contract rose 41 cents andother months were even higher.   Among refined products, the July heating oil contract rose 1.95cents to 50.04 cents a gallon and the unleaded gasoline contractfor July delivery jumped 1.51 cents to 64.85 cents a gallon. Othercontract months also gained.   ``There was no news and no cash reason why the market behavedlike this,'' said James R. Fiedler, vice president in charge ofenergy brokering for E.D.andamp;F. Man International Futures Inc. ``Itwas most likely the rumor of a rumor story.''   OPEC ministers are scheduled to open talks on Monday in Viennafocusing on the cartel's production ceiling for the second half ofthe year.   Market observers said there was little news from Vienna, whereOPEC's eight-member monitoring committee met briefly and thenadjourned. The rally, they said, coincided with the end of themeeting, which was intended to lay the groundwork for Monday's fullministerial meeting.   ``The question is why would it be so bullish,'' said NaumanBarakat, vice president of energy investments at Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc. ``The fact that the meeting adjourned without anycontention and vitriolic statements by the Kuwaitis and the Saudisindicates they want to find a compromise.''   OPEC is expected to raise its output ceiling by at least 1million barrels a day over the current 18.5 million barrels tostabilize prices at around current levels.   But Kuwait's insistence on a higher quota has pitted it againstits Persian Gulf neighbor, Saudi Arabia, the largest OPEC producer.   Barakat said that speculation that OPEC General SecretarySubroto had arrived at a formula for resolving the differencesbetween the Saudis and Kuwaitis helped lift prices.   Other analysts attributed the gains to technical factors, ledprimarily by a strong rise in heating oil.   ``Heating oil had been oversold so it had more potential torally,'' said Jim Steel, an analyst with Refco Inc. ``It led crudeoil and coming up to the weekend, I'm not surprised to seeshort-covering.''</TEXT></DOC>
