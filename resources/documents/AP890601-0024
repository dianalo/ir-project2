Family Court Judge Leon Deutsch said he didn't believe themother, Migdalia Pagan, when she said she didn't know thewhereabouts of her husband and son.   Deutsch said Mrs. Pagan, 35, would be brought from a city jail,where she has been held since Tuesday, to his courtroom daily untilthe boy was returned.   ``My plea is to the mother and the father if he can hear me. Ifhe comes forward and produces the child, I will order her releaseforthwith,'' Deutsch said at the hearing.   Mrs. Pagan, 35, who appeared distraught, did not speak atWednesday's hearing. She told the judge under oath Tuesday beforeher arrest that she did not know where her husband and son had gone.   David Pagan, 36, took his son, Darian, from the MemorialSloan-Kettering Hospital sometime Sunday, police said.   Darian was hospitalized Friday under an order from Deutsch thatwas requested by the city's Child Welfare Administration becausehospital officials said the boy was not getting the treatment heneeded.   Family members have said that Darian had been complaining ofpain and that the father wanted to take the boy to Disney World inFlorida.   Police said they received information that Pagan may have takenDarian to a cancer-treatment center in Arlington, Texas.   Mrs. Pagan's lawyer, Steven Mandel, called Deutsch's detentionorder improper and said he would appeal it Thursday.   Mandel charged that the judge was using Mrs. Pagan as``leverage'' to pressure the father to come forward.   The lawyer insisted that Mrs. Pagan was telling the truth whenshe said she didn't know where her husband and son had gone. Hesaid the husband had called a family member once since disappearingsaid only that he and Darian were safe.   Mandel said that when hospital officials went to the cityagency, doctors said Darian was in ``imminent danger'' if he didnot receive a radical form of radiation and chemotherapy.   The parents, who live in Brooklyn, were upset because no suchtreatment was administered between Friday, when the boy wasadmitted, and Sunday, when he was taken from the hospital, Mandelsaid.   He said the child had received much medical care and treatmentfor leukemia since he was diagnosed at age 2.</TEXT></DOC>
