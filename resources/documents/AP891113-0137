(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A human-powered helicopter hasmade its first flight with a bicycle racer's leg muscles spinningthe craft's 100-foot rotor blade.   Videotape was used to verify that it lifted several inches offthe ground for several seconds Sunday inside a gymnasium, BobAnderson, a spokesman for California State Polytechnic University,San Luis Obispo, said Monday.   No previous human-powered helicopter has ever gotten off theground, even though the idea for such a craft dates back nearly 500years to the sketches of Leonardo Da Vinci, said Chris Colliganwith the American Helicopter Society in Alexandria, Va.   The 100-pound copter, known as the Da Vinci III, hovered inchesabove the floor under the pedaling power of cyclist Greg McNeil, aCal Poly aeronautical engineering major who races on the U.S.cycling team.   The Da Vinci III is the fourth helicopter to be built bystudents since 1981, when the project was first attempted. The lastversion, the Da Vinci IIb, was damaged in May.   Students began preparing the helicopter for its flight Saturdaynight, making subtle adjustments necessary for a stable flight,said David Calta, 22, president of the local student chapter of theAmerican Helicopter Society.   The craft, made mostly of composite materials and plastic,finally took to the air at around 7 a.m. Sunday.   ``We don't know what time it was exactly. It was so excitingthat nobody bothered to look at their watches,'' said Anderson.   Neal Saiki, 23, a Cal Poly senior who has worked on the projectfor more than two years, said three specific improvementscontributed to the success of the latest model.   ``We made it lighter, we made the rotors straighter and we got apilot with a better output,'' Saiki said.   The next step, the students said, will be to fly the helicopterfor officials of the American Helicopter Society, who must witnessa flight before the Da Vinci III formally becomes a part ofaviation history.   After that, the students said, they'll call the Guinness Book ofWorld Records.   Don't look for a home version, Saiki said.   ``It's far too big to ever be popular,'' he said. ``I mean, itfills up the gym practically wall to wall.''</TEXT></DOC>
