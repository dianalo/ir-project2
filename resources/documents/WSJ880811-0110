But a spokesman for American, a unit of AMR Corp., Fort Worth, Texas, said the carrier doesn't plan to establish a connecting hub or to greatly expand service in Miami. &quot;This is not a part of a strategy aimed at moving in on Eastern or anyone else,&quot; the American spokesman asserted.    American said, however, that the move will strengthen its growing presence in the competitive Southeastern U.S. market, where the carrier plans to replace narrowbody aircraft with wide-body jets, requiring more crew members based in the region. American has increased its Florida service in the past two years to 11 cities from seven, and total daily Florida departures to 78 from 29.    American plans initially to move 85 pilots and 75 flight attendants to Miami, with a total of 325 pilots and 375 flight attendants moving there within several years. Under the plan, American also will establish a crew base at its Nashville hub, beginning with 75 flight attendants and growing to 600.    The move follows the expansion of major airlines into previously untested markets across the country. Delta Air Lines, for example, a carrier with strong presence on the East Coast, has invaded turf to the West, with relatively new connecting hubs in Cincinnati and Salt Lake City. In the past two years, American has developed hubs in Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and Nashville to bolster its presence in the East.    &quot;We're seeing a lot of share-shifting going on,&quot; said Edward Starkman, airline analyst at PaineWebber Inc. &quot;With the strength of frequent-flyer programs going on, it's a nice wedge to get into new markets.&quot;    Moreover, service in Miami helps feed traffic to American's hub in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and to the rest of the Caribbean -- where it is engaged in another dogfight with Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp. Analysts estimate that in San Juan, the heart of the lucrative Caribbean vacation market, American last year had a 45% market share, compared with Eastern's 43%.    Some analysts have speculated that Eastern or Pan Am Corp., which also suffers from steep losses, might be forced to sell their South American route authorities -- and that American would be well-positioned to purchase them with operations in Miami and San Juan.    A spokeswoman for Eastern said she didn't believe that American's new crew bases will have any effect on Eastern's operations. </TEXT></DOC>
