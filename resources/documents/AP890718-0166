So far, the French Foreign Ministry ``has not yet said what, ifanything, has been approved for transfer to Brazil,'' said RichardBoucher, the department spokesman.   The Washington Times, quoting unidentified officials in a storypublished Tuesday, said the French Embassy in Brasilia has notifiedthe U.S. Embassy there that France has granted preliminary approvalfor the transfer of technology relating to the Viking liquid-fuelrocket engine, which is used to propel the French Arianespace-launch missile.   The transfer could be in violation of the Missile TechnologyControl Regime, signed in 1987 by several countries including Franceand the United States.   Boucher said the regime states ``there is a strong presumptionagainst the transfer of sensitive rocket technology, which isclassified as ``category one.''   If France were to transfer a ``category one'' rocket, Paris wouldhave to require that it not be transferred without the consent ofthe French government, Boucher said.   He also said the United States has in the past raised with theBrazilians its concerns about military trade with Libya, a countrythe United States has accused of inciting acts of terrorism.   But Boucher said, ``The supposition that French rocket technologywill flow to Libya is merely speculation.''</TEXT></DOC>
