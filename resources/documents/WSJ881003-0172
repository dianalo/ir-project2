Miller (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> XRX </CO><IN> EDP PRO </IN><TEXT>   Xerox Corp. is taking a step to reap more benefits from its vast storehouse of computer technology and to fight a slump in the artificial-intelligence market.    Recently, the copier giant spun off its troubled AI business, newly christened Envos Corp., and retained a minority stake. Last week, Envos shipped its first products as an independent company, software developed as part of an alliance with Sun Microsystems Inc. that Envos hopes will expand its sales beyond the AI-specialty market.    Envos, while small, points up two powerful computer-industry trends -- one at Xerox and one in the young AI industry, which makes technology that helps computers reason like humans.    For Xerox, Envos is the latest example of the Stamford, Conn.-based company's drive to shake its reputation as a progenitor of high-technology ideas that benefit everyone in the industry except itself. The easy-to-use screen design of Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh computer; the personal computer networks of 3Com Corp.; the printer software of Adobe Systems Inc.; and the portable personal computers of Grid Systems Corp. all had their roots at Xerox. To reap the rewards of such projects, Xerox lately has been spinning them off into separate companies and retaining an equity stake.    Beyond Xerox, Envos faces a two-year-old business climate known in high-tech circles as the &quot;AI winter.&quot; Red ink has been raining upon one AI company after another -- including Symbolics Inc., Teknowledge Inc. and Intellicorp -- and Xerox's business has been hurt, too. Among the slump's chief causes: The industry had too many engineers with dazzling technical visions, and not enough businessmen with marketing savvy.    Envos was born in 1982 as Xerox's artificial-intelligence systems business unit. It made computers and software used for writing AI programs. Programmers would use its products to create software that would draw inferences and conclusions from a mass of evidence-diagnosing a problem, for instance, or predicting one.    Xerox had one main handicap in the AI market: It was a lumbering titan competing with agile start-ups. &quot;Xerox couldn't market its way out of a paper bag, and that's especially true in AI,&quot; says Harvey Newquist, publisher of AI Trends.    This summer, Xerox spun off its AI unit into an independent company, 85%-owned by its 36 employees. Xerox and one of its European joint ventures own the balance. Xerox also has an option to purchase an additional 25% stake.    The spin-off christened itself with a random name that employees thought sounded high-tech. It went out and hired three seasoned managers, including a new chief executive officer. With its first products, Envos abandoned its old idea of selling programs that run only on its own machines, and began selling programs for the widely used Sun workstations.    Xerox says it took about a year to create Envos, from the day the plan was hatched. The company says it plans other similar moves and wants to strip the spinoff process down to just two months. </TEXT></DOC>
