In 27 B.C., Augustus, havingdefeated Antony and Cleopatra and pacified much of the knownworld, was busily consolidating the new Roman emperorship.   This new Rome needed an arts policy to match its grandself-image. Augustus, therefore, set up a virtual ImperialEndowment for the Arts under the suave Etruscan magnateMaecenas.

Augustus, therefore, set up a virtual ImperialEndowment for the Arts under the suave Etruscan magnateMaecenas. It was Maecenas' luck to hire some of history'sgreatest poets as enthusiastic propagandists for the FirstCitizen -- Virgil and Horace. Virgil had already celebratedAugustus as a restorer of peace and fertility to the Italiancountryside in &quot;The Georgics.&quot; Now he had to write the epicof Rome. &quot;Epic&quot; meant, since the Romans were earnestfollowers of the Greeks, a long saga with gods and battles.Just like Homer. He wrote &quot;The Aeneid,&quot; a wonderful newtranslation of which is recently out (Penguin Classics,$5.95).   Substantially complete, save for a few loose ends leftbehind at Virgil's death in 19 B.C., &quot;The Aeneid&quot; is thestory of the Trojan Prince Aeneas escaping the Greek sack ofhis town and bringing a Trojan remnant to Italy as thenucleus of the future Rome. This was a new job for an epic --to tell a high-minded national foundation myth in archaicdrag. Homer's heroes had not been concerned with any sweep ofimperial history: Odysseus, for example, had enough problemsgetting back to his small island of Ithaca.   But what turns out to give electricity and life and angerand tension to &quot;The Aeneid&quot; is not dull, worthy Aeneas'imperial crusade, but the victims he crushes under thoseimplacably rolling chariot wheels. In the poem's second half,Aeneas embroils sundry unoffending indigenous Italians in amessy war to make room for him and his band. But it is in thepoem's first half that he accomplishes his most notoriousmischief -- the destruction of Dido.   Driven from her homeland in Phoenicia by a cruelbrother-in-law, the adventurous and creative Dido had led anelite of her people to the barren North African shore and wasin the process of founding the bustling utopian city ofCarthage when, deflected by Venus (Aeneas' mother), sherescued the shipwrecked Trojans and fell in love with theirchieftain.   Soon she was forgetting about the blueprints for theSenate House and concentrating on reading entrails instead:&quot;But priests, as we know, are ignorant. What use are prayersand shrines to a passionate woman? The flame was eating thesoft marrow of her bones, and the wound lived under herbreast. Dido was on fire with love and wandered all over thecity in her misery and madness like a wounded deer . . .&quot;This romantic internalizing is a new note in Latin epic;Virgil had been impressed by such Greek heroines of erotictragedy as Medea and Phaedra.   Dido's reward for preferring private passion to publicglory was to see her lover sail away. But not before she gavehim a piece of her mind: &quot;Look for your kingdom over thewaves . . . I shall follow you not in the flesh but in theblack fires of death . . . You will receive the punishmentyou deserve and the news of it will reach me deep among thedead.&quot; The mood music swells for the queen's last evening:&quot;It was night and weary living things were peacefully takingtheir rest upon the earth . . . But not Dido . . . Her eyesand mind would not accept the night.&quot;   The queen rejects any notion of accompanying Aeneas andregrets not having dealt differently with him at the start(&quot;Could I not have taken him and torn him limb from limb andscattered the pieces in the sea? . . . or served {Aeneas'little son's} flesh at his father's table?&quot;) She decides onsuicide, leaving vengeance to some future Carthaginian (thatis, to Hannibal). The queen falls on her sword, and &quot;Allwarmth went out of Dido's body and her life passed into thewinds.&quot;   David West's new prose translation proves two things about&quot;The Aeneid.&quot; The first we knew: It is the victims' poem.They -- the Italians and young Trojans like Nisus andEuryalus, and above all Dido -- steal the story from therigid Roman robots backed by head god Jupiter. Flesh beatsmarble. Secondly, and surprisingly, prose can work superblyto capture the sad, conflicted music of Virgil. Notrollicking, whale-of-a-story prose, but sweet prose, clearand clean and dancing like a mountain stream, as here.   To gauge the nature and extent of Mr. West's triumph,compare his version of Dido and the entrails with the 1956Penguin prose of Jackson Knight: &quot;But how pitifully weak isthe prescience of seers] There lay no help for herinfatuation in temples or in prayers.&quot; Compare it, too, withthe rapturously received 1983 verse translation of RobertFitzgerald: &quot;Alas, what darkened minds have soothsayers]/What good are shrines and vows to maddened lovers?&quot; And hereis Mr. Fitzgerald's version of Dido haranguing Aeneas: &quot;Youwill pay for this,/Unconscionable] I shall hear] The newswill reach me/Even among the lowest of the dead.&quot; And here isFitzgerald on Dido dead: &quot;Her body's warmth fell intodissolution,/And out into the winds her life withdrew.&quot;   Prescience? Infatuation? Soothsayers? Unconscionable?Dissolution? Dry polysyllables settle on those translationslike chalk dust. It's language like theirs that has keptpotential readers from &quot;the classics.&quot; Preferring simplicityto archaic locutions, Mr. West remains closer to the Latinsense and quietly achieves many an iambic beat more naturallythan Mr. Fitzgerald. He opens the window and the winds bringlife into Virgil's body.</TEXT></DOC>
