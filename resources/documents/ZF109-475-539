Well, they want you to discover the advantage of&quot;outsourcing&quot; with TUMS (Telephone Usage Management System) service-bureaureporting.andM;They're offering a report-suppression printing capability that allows clientsto &quot;call the shots&quot; as to which of the wide range of TUMS reports they wantprinted every month.andP;  Now clients can tailor their TUMS reports to meetspecific requirements, eliminating unnecessary paper.andP;  And, as theirparticular demands change, they can add or delete reports in their TUMSpackage.andP;  And if they need help designing reports, expert customer-supportanalysts will help them.andM;Obviously, one of the alleged downfalls of using a service bureau is you losea bit of control and flexibility.andP;  So this feature, which gives theservice-bureau user extra control and flexibility, is, of course, a gooddeal.andM;Further, those who want to view their TUMS reports on a PC can order them ona floppy disk.andP;  Called TeleView, this product lets people scan reports on ascreen quickly and easily, select and print specific reports as needed andallows for archiving in an efficient manner.andP;  Clients who use TeleView inaddition to their monthly printed reports enjoy hands-on control for ad hocprinting .... leaving all the processing to Account-A-Call's capable hands.andM;ATandamp;TandM;Cost Allocator is the newest member of ATandamp;T's (Bridgewater, Nj) family ofAccounting Management Products.andP;  It's for mid-to-highend jobs and especiallyfor multi-site applications.andM;Built on the UNIX platform and running on the  386 processor line, it canaccept call records from either ATandamp;T or selected non-ATandamp;T switches.andP;  Itoffers four types of reports but each can be tweaked by the user to fithis/her particular needs.andM;Optional packages are available like the Basic Poller, a software option,that lets users reach out and touch remote sites and collect call recordsfrom far-flung remote areas.andM;AUDITECHandM;Auditech's (Bothell, WA) TDR standalone call-accounting system now interfaceswith Centrex environments such as the DMS-10 and DMS-100 CO switches fromNorthern.andP;  And other Centrex interfaces are on the way.andM;Depending on the requirement, the TDR can be directly connected at the CO orset up on a leased or dial-up line.andP;  Further, in an ISDN environment, the TDRcan be configured such that ISDN information provided by a PBX can bedisplayed by the system - things like ANI, etc.andM;TDR can also now be used as a terminal to do adds, moves and changes on yourPBX while it still collects SMDR.andP;  This saves you money because of theobvious added functionality and the help it gives field engineers with amaintenance station on site.andM;Auditech's PC-2000 CallAccounting System now has polling screen reports andCentrex interfacing too.andP;  Both are new.andM;CBISandM;Cincinnati Bell Information Systems (Cincinnati, OH) recently announcedseveral enhancements to its CMS-2000 and CMS-3000 products:andM;Plus Option.andP;  This allows realtime, on-line access to the system databasefiles to make inquiries or changes at any time, viewing the result of thosechanges immediately.andP;  This option not only purports to save time, but itgives the customer greater accuracy and control over their database.andM;Network  Management Reports.andP;  They've added nine, new standard NetworkManagement Reports.andP;  They reflect changes made to carrier tariff structuresas well as let the customer accurately perform bill and cost validation.andM;Rating  Enhancements.andP;  They've expanded its already extensive tariff ratingcapabilities to include ATandamp;T SDN, MCI VNET and US Sprint VPN.andP;  In addition,CBIS added the ability to specify a unique cost for individual phone numbers.andO;This also allows the customer to allocate charges to calls that some tariffvendors don't support like NPA 900 and NXX 976 calls.andM;CGIandM;At Communications Group, Inc. (King of Prussia, PA), they're responding to anew marketplace with two new products - the ITMS/III InteractiveTelecommunications Management System and the Interactive Service Bureau(ISB).andM;The strategy will have end users, die-hard service bureau clients and the new&quot;hybrid&quot; customer (one who prefers to mix the advantages of an in-houseproduct with the convenience of a service bureau) all using the sametechnology.andM;CGI expects growth with its end user ITMS/III system which operates with thesame interface on PCs, micro and minis and LANs.andP;  The cross-platformcompatibility lets customers move from one platform to another should theydecide to use, say, PCs instead of a mini a few years after they install thesystem.andM;ITMS/III provides a smooth transition for CGI service-bureau clients who wantto move in-house and add more high-end telemanagement options like telephonedirectories and message center, cable management, trouble tickets andwork-order management, etc.andM;Their Interactive Service Bureau (ISB) is for the customer thinking abouttelemanagement/ call-accounting but isn't ready to bring a system in-house.andO;They can purchase, lease or rent the ITMS/III and operate all or part of thesystem.andP;  ISB supports a number of interesting scenarios.andM;For instance, a company can choose CGI to maintain the day-today callaccounting, while on-site managers handle the facilities management.andP;  Or alongtime service-bureau client may move his operation in-house and thendecide to move back to the service bureau.andP;  Flexible.andP;  Nice.andM;CINTECHandM;During the past six months Cintech (Cincinnati, OH) enhanced its Tele-Seriesproducts and released new modules.andM;You can now look at TeleSeries' reports on-line.andP;  This eliminates the need toprint voluminous hard-copy reports.andP;  Nice for people who access informationvia a network.andM;Tele-Cost is a new PC-based product that costs calls in real time.andP;  Itprovides input to any application software that needs calls costed.andP;  Initialpartners include developers of hospitality, legal and education rebillingsystems.andM;Tele-Series can now also do central-corporate reporting.andP;  This is for peoplewith multi-site needs.andP;  Basically, they have made it easier to handlemultiple sites.andP;  Further, Auto-Poll allows multi-site TeleSeries users toautomatically transfer processed call data between remote sites and a centralsite for combined and/or consolidated reporting.andP;  Key features includecompletely unattended polling, unlimited number of polled sites, password andsecurity protection, activity log files and bost-controlled diagnostics forremote PCs.andM;COMPCOandM;Working with Open Application Interface (OAI) is the big news from Compco(Brentwood, TN).andP;  Their  integrated  call accounting/telemanagement systemscan now take advantage of CIT VAX  DEC's OAI) and Northern's OAI.andP;  Resultingapplications include integrated directory (automatically updated with adds,moves, changes to the switch), message center and all-security center.andO;Testing with Northern ended in August and it's available now.andM;Other enhancements: increased speed in costing of calls; increased speed ofreports during call rating/processing cycle by 10 to 1; increasedscreen-to-screen response; automatic file optimization on DEC VAX; andenhancement for their student long-distance resale/registration application.andM;DIGILOGandM;Digilog's (Montgomeryville, PA) new version of their Administrator is acomprehensive facilities management and call-accounting system.andP;  Brandspankin'new, folks.andM;It consists of a bunch of software and hardware stuff ranging from awork-order-based inventory management module and multi-site call-accountingmodule to an on-line directory services module and resale billing module.andO;That's a mouthful of modules.andM;It runs on several platforms including DEC VAX and MicroVAX systems under VMSas well as on IBM mainframes under MVS/CICS and on PCs under DOS.andP;  You canmove from one platform to another as you grow without reentering databases orrelearning the system.andP;  Cool metro.andM;The system can grow big.andP;  Right now, it's up and running on systems rangingin size from one switch with several hundred phones to more than 15 PBXs withmore than 40,000 phones.andM;E-COMMSandM;This isn't product news, really, other than a nice recommendation forE-Comms' (Gig Harbor, WA) line of call-accounting buffers.andP;  That's right,E-Comms doesn't make call-accounting systems, they make buffers otherpeople's systems use to store call records and, especially, take care ofremote, multi-site applications.andM;The news? Ericsson will sell EComms' buffers worldwide in conjunction withtheir PBXs and key systems.andP;  E-Comms' proprietary data compression andnonvolatile memory were key factors in winning this lucrative contract.andM;But there's product news as well.andP;  E-Comms has also released some new modelsand options this month.andM;First, let's talk about their new models - the CAD-5 andamp; POLLCAB5.andP;  With theirnew, improved proprietary data compression, these babies have 2 Mb of storageand hold 50,000 call records.andM;Second, they added a couple of new options available for CABs and POLLCABs,starting with a 48 Volt DCC operation option.andP;  This lets you tap into the PBXbattery supply which allows full operation as long as the PBX has powerduring power failures.andP;  Next, they are offering an internal LDM in the CABsand POLLCABs.andP;  This is nice for local sites between a PBX and PC when the PCis on the other side of the building.andM;ENHANCED SYSTEMSandM;Enhanced Systems (Norcross, GA) announced a series of callaccountinginnovations for their Callsort Plus system:andM;Phone Alert.andP;  By integrating call accounting (Callsort) and voice processing(their Hello! system), the system administrator is notified of varioussituations such as lack of traffic on a specific trunk or calls made over acertain dollar amount.andP;  The administrator can be notified via a voice-mailmessage or through a digital pager.andP;  Excellent.andM;Callblock.andP;  This is a sophisticated traffic-analysis report generatoroffering extensive blockage statistics including detail and summary blockagereports.andM;Messaging Interfaces.andP;  By integrating their Callsort and Pinksheet (textmessaging) products, reports are available which analyze information such ashow long it takes people to return phone calls.andM;Telemarketing Analyzer.andP;  Callsort offers reports tailored for telemarketingenvironments like the percentage of time telemarketers are on the phoneduring an eight-hour day.andM;Account-Code Ability.andP;  This is for companies without account code capabilityfrom their phone system.andP;  Callsort can define a phone number as an accountcode for tracking and generating reports.andM;ANI Report.andP;  This breaks down calls that are incoming.andP;  But you need to getthe ANI information from somewhere.andP;  If you get it, though, Callsort willcrunch it.andM;ESTECH SYSTEMSandM;Estech Systems (Plano, TX) has always been active in the lodging arena ofcall accounting.andP;  But now they are offering a new callaccounting system forregular business users - PhoneBill for Business.andM;PhoneBill for Business is a standalone desktop unit with features usuallyfound only on larger systems like: call-record storage up to 9,000 records;departmental costing; account-code capability; and flexible manual andautomatic reporting.andM;The system's day-to-day operation is so simple the instructions are printedon the case.andP;  Reports are requested by indicating the type of report you want(detail or summary), the category (by extension, account code, department,area code, etc.) and the individual items within the category (such as anextension, extensions or all extensions).andM;Reports or customer-defined groups of reports can automatically print daily,weekly and monthly any way you want.andP;  They can also be printed on demand withjust a single keystroke.andM;The system's rates can be changed by the customer at any time and is notdependent on periodic and expensive rate chips or downloads of data.andP;  Newexchanges or area codes are automatically added.andP;  The system also hasprovisions for international and special calls such as 976, information, 800and 900 calls.andM;INFORTEXTandM;Infortext (Schaumburg, IL) is proud to announce an Optional Answer DetectionDevice for their OS family of call-accounting systems.andP;  Big news, really.andO;Answer detection will drastically reduce guest bitches (unless, of course,Harry is staying in your fine establishment).andM;The lodging industry has used call-accounting systems to bill guests forawhile now.andP;  Unfortunately, these systems have been unableandM;I if calls actually went through.andP;  Lost revenue from undetected calls andguest complaints about charges have been a major headache for motels, hotelsand resorts.andM;Previously, a &quot;minimum duration&quot; timer (around 45 seconds) determined if acall was valid.andP;  Guests were charged for all calls over this threshold,including calls to invalid numbers or numbers where no one answered.andP;  Shortercalls, meanwhile, were not detected.andM;Infortext's new Answer Detection Device uses technology which &quot;listens&quot; tothe tones and other sounds which occur after someone dials a call, includingthe &quot;special intercept tone&quot; preceding recorded messages.andP;  SMDR data isforwarded to the call-accounting system only after a valid answer has beendetected.andM;The device also includes failsafe mechanisms which prevent loss of revenue inthe event of detection failure or system failure without blocking guestcalls.andP;  The benefits of all this are obvious increased billing accuracy witha resulting increase in revenues and, more importantly, guest satisfaction.andO;INTEGRATED COMPUTERandM;ENGINEERINGandM;Two new things from ICE (Denver, CO): a hotel automation PBX interface; andsomething called a SIMS interface.andM;Their Hotel Automation System provides the under-150-room hotel market withan integrated front-desk and call-accounting system.andP;  Running on a single IBMPCAT, it automatically posts room charges as well as phone calls to guestbills.andM;ICE is working with both Comdial and Mitel to develop a unique new interfaceto their small hotel switching systems capable of more than automaticphone-charge posting.andP;  Running as an enhancement of their front-deskmanagement software, this module will automatically turn on a guest phone atcheckin, restrict toll calls at check-out or if a credit limit is exceeded,set or cancel wake-up calls or do-not-disturb status, set or cancel messagelights (and take the message), indicate room-ready status based on codesentered by the maid at the room phone and, of course, automatically postguest calls to their bill.andM;Their are several new features to their ICECATS Hotel/Motel CallAccountingsoftware.andP;  First there is the ability to set guest phone-bill credit limits.andO;For hotel switches that can be externally controlled, ICECATS willautomatically toll restrict the room phone when the guest's phone-billexceeds the credit limit.andM;As part of a contract with US Air Force on-base billeting network, ICECATScan now meet the newest USAF Billeting Call Accounting specs.andP;  This involvesinterfacing to the USAF Services Information Management System (SIMS) to notonly transmit costed telephone calls, but also room status settings enteredby maids.andP;  As far as we know, they are the only maker who can claim this.andM;ICECATS Hotel/Motel system for hotels ranges from 50 to 2,000 rooms and forstandalone as well as Property Management System interface applications.andM;MER COMMUNICATIONandM;SYSTEMSandM;Lots of new stuff at Mer (New York, NY) - an up-and-coming player in thecall-accounting/tele-F management arena.andP;  Here's a sampling of newenhancements in their TABS Release 5.l:andM;Graphics.andP;  This integrated feature lets you take certain boring reports andspice them up, displaying or printing them with clear, simple andeasy-to-read bars.andM;History.andP;  You can now summarize all calls on a monthly resolution level.andO;Summaries by extension, departments or divisions can bedisplayed/printed/graphed from &quot;the beginning of time&quot; even though the callsmay have long been archived.andP;  Excellent for showing the activity of anextension over a year.andM;Tracking.andP;  In addition to an extension or dialed number being tagged for theexception report, this feature opens a window and sounds an alarm wheneverany activity for the specified extension and/or dialed number is detected.andM;Inactivity.andP;  TABS will now tell you if the PBX has stopped sending data orthe cable to the PC is in any way screwed up.andP;  The alarm sounds when therehas not been any activity to the TABS for a certain amount of definable time,depending on time of day.andP;  A nice safety feature for hotels or anyone forwhom calls equals money.andP;  Pretty much everyone, right?andM;Living Color.andP;  All TABS screens are now displayed in &quot;living color.&quot; Thiscolor scheme can be changed for messages, data and text, background,foreground, etc., to any color you want.andM;In addition, Mer will be introducing a new card by the end of this yearcalled the TABS 2000.andP;  The only difference will be the buffer storage of4,000 call records, compared to 2,100 for TABS and 1,500 for TABS Jr.andP;  (Theirsystem is a combination PC card and software system.)andM;MOSCOMandM;MaxNet Call-Accounting Software version 7 is Moscom's (East Rochester, NY)latest version of their UNIX-based system.andP;  Key new features include NetworkRating, Custom Reports, ANI recording and support for ATandamp;T SDN and MCI VNETtariffs.andM;Network Rating will link call records collected from a user's private (ETN)trunk network.andP;  Each link of the call can have an unique rating defined bythe user.andP;  MaxNet CAS also rates the call with the correct Vandamp;H coordinates ofthe switch that actually accessed the public network rather than the switchwhere the call originated.andM;Custom  Reports  provide MaxNet CAS users with a database query interface toall MaxNet call records, organizations and trunk information.andP;  This SQLinterface supports ad hoc queries as well as the tools to generate customreports.andP;  A wide range of arithmetic functions is available and results canbe present in several formats.andM;MaxNet CAS version 7 will correctly identify the ANI field from incoming callrecords and store the information in the database.andP;  MaxNet CAS' standardselection reports as well as custom reports will display the incoming dialednumber in the dialed digit field.andP;  MacNet CAS' rating can be customized tosupport incoming 800 tariffs to estimate 800 service charges.andM;The new version is currently available for the ATandamp;T 6386 WGS and IBM PS/2model 70 and model 80 workstations running the IBM AIX operating system.andO;NEWCASTLE COMMUNICATIONSandM;We've said it before and we'll say it again - Newcastle (New York, NY) is a&quot;weird&quot; supply house.andP;  They specialize in just two things: the distributionof five different maker's call-accounting systems; and several differentmakers of voice processing systems.andM;Their prices are the same (or less) as the prices from the makers themselves.andO;So if you're too busy to become an expert on call accounting and/or voiceprocessing and want a source that gives you that extra bit of support throughthe sale and installation of a call accounting or voice processing systems...andP;  whew! ...andP;  you should give 'em a call.andM;On the news side of things, Newcastle is carrying a new callaccounting system- ICE's ICECATS PC-based system for the hotel industry.andP;  It's a very simpleand reliable system that interfaces with just about every property managementsystem.andP;  If the hotel is also looking for a reservation-and-room billingpackage, ICECATS has that too.andP;  Most importantly, Newcastle people tell us,the package is priced right with a wonderful margin.andM;ONE PLUSandM;Version 4.0 of One Plus' (Colorado Springs, CO) Office Managementcall-accounting program is available this month.andP;  In addition to the manyreports and features of previous versions, it has two distinct advantages:andM;First, it's faster.andM;Second, it lets the user create their own reports.andP;  Thus, if the more than 40different reports already prepared by the system don't give you exactly whatyou're looking for, this version lets you create your own format.andM;OSITECHandM;Ositech's (Guelph, Ontario) CS7000 family of standalone callaccountingsystems is now available with a new feature called Dial-A-Report.andP;  It letsusers get various reports from the CS7000 by simply dialing a number fromtheir phone.andM;For example, reports can be printed for a single extension, group orall-stations and account codes.andP;  The main advantage of this feature is itssimplicity and ease of operation.andP;  Since the procedure is identical to makinga phone call the user need only remember the number assigned to a givenreport.andM;Further  simplification  is achieved by programming the report number as aspeed-dial number.andP;  The user just presses the speed-dial number on the phoneand the report starts printing.andP;  Neat.andM;In addition to the Dial-A-Report feature, users can also program a number ofparameters into the CS7000 from their phone.andP;  Users can set percentagemarkups, exceptions, flat charges, passwords, etc., all by dialing a numberfrom a phone.andP;  Users can now connect either a serial or parallel printer tothe system too.andM;The CS7000 is a standalone system that doesn't require a terminal or PC.andO;It's available in costing and non-costing versions.andP;  SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENTandM;TECHNOLOGIESandM;SDT (Naperville, IL) has a bunch of new features in its callaccountingsystems.andP;  We can't talk about all of them  You'll have to call them), buthere's a partial list: * They now have mouse-compatibility for an improveduser interface.andP;  * Real-time monitoring and annunciation of trunk failuresand unusual call types.andP;  * Extensive improvements in international pricingmethods and international area/city name list identification for foreignpoints of origin.andP;  * Full real-time call accounting for Centrex users withon-line communications.andP;  * A bunch of new reports based on new featuresyou'll find on PBXs these days: detailed console operator statistics;transferred calls tallied for each participant; hold time statistics; queuingstatistics; and ANI identification.andM;SOFT-COMandM;Soft-Com (New York, NY) added a cool feature to its concurrent DOS version ofScout and to all versions of Commander.andP;  It goes by the name of Caller NumberID.andP;  Some companies call it Alert Numbers.andP;  Here's what it can do for you: *In the database, the customer sets up categories of calls (i.e., vendors,home number, head hunters, publications, etc.); * The customer then assignsindividual phone numbers to the categories and identifies them as appropriate(like  212-691-8215, Publication, TELECONNECT); * Every time the identifiednumber is called, Scout or Commander replaces the city and state with theidentified name; * And this replacement appears on all reports and within theCalled Number ID reports themselves.andM;Soft-Com's Commander CallAccounting Version 2 is now being shipped as well.andO;It adds several customer-requested features like:andM;Individual Carrier Per Trunk Group.andP;  With most of the popular LD carriersalready included in the database, the customer can now select which carrieris servicing each trunk or trunk group.andM;System Traffic Report.andP;  With a simple matrix, The Commander produces a reportof the number of calls, per hour, per day, incoming and/or outgoing.andM;Scheduled Reports.andP;  Again, with a simple matrix, each report in the systemcan be scheduled to run daily, weekly or monthly with a start and end time aswell as actual run time.andM;SUMMA FOURandM;Summa Four (Manchester, NH) released Prophet Writer in July.andP;  It's areport-generator software package that works with their Summa Prophet seriesof callaccounting products.andM;Reports contain names for extensions, departments, trunks, account codes andcalled city and state.andP;  It gives you virtually unlimited call storage and 30reports on any or all data stored on hard disk in six categories: extension;company; account code; trunk; directory; and call analysis.andM;The user specifies selection criteria for data to be in the report.andP;  Adedicated PC is not required.andP;  The software only runs when polling callrecords or producing reports.andP;  Automatic or manual polling is provided.andP;  Thesystem is currently single site but multi-site use will be available in thenext release.andM;Also of interest in the world of Summa Four is their Summa Prophet AnswerDetection.andP;  This gives you positive indication of call completion.andP;  This iscritical, of course, when it comes to accurate call pricing.andM;Targeted to the hospitality industry, it replaces the timers currently (andinaccurately) used to determine whether to bill a call to a guest.andP;  Thesystem is available in increments of eight trunks and can be used with eitherSMDR or PMS data streams.andP;  It's available with integrated Summa Prophethospitality call accounting or standalone.andP;  SUNBELT BUSINESS COMPUTERSandM;Sunbelt Computers (Phoenix, AZ) now offers complete turnkey verticaltelemanagement solutions for switch makers, RBOCs and interconnects.andP;  That'snews, right?andM;It's a reseller gig.andP;  The solution includes  RFP  point-by-point response,hardware and software configuration, installation, training, maintenance,rate-table subscriptions, database conversion and any required customization.andM;With the solution, the reseller can meet users' complicated needs withoutbeing an expert in telemanagement or call accounting, Sunbelt says.andO;Specialized applications include Student Resale, Hospital Patient and DoctorResale, 911 and government applications.andM;Me question Sunbelt is asking is simply, &quot;Why learn the industry fromscratch?&quot; Their answer? &quot;Don't bother.andP;  Use us instead.&quot;andM;SYSTEMS RELIABILITYandM;Systems Reliability (Sarasota, FL) now offers theircall-accounting/telemanagement software product - Orbi-Tel - on the RISC DECand IBM computers.andP;  This moves the product into the latest generation ofhigh-speed processors, especially important for people polling multi-sitesand processing millions of call records a month.andM;The Orbi-Tel Advanced CallAccounting module is for multi-site and largesingle-site jobs - we're talking upwards of around 30,000 lines.andP;  Remotelocations in multi-site applications are taken care of by onsite storagedevices.andP;  Me system filters calls by type, duration and access codes.andM;The collected records are stored in battery-backed memory until retrieved andprocessed.andP;  An Audit function happens magically every night whereby costs areassigned using standard Vandamp;H Tariff tables or user-defined pricing.andP;  Theprocessed detail information is then stored on magnetic disk and summarystatics reflecting total calls, cost and duration by each station and trunkin the system.andM;Based on the UNIX operating system and Informix relational-databasemanagement system, Orbi-Tel offers the user an integrated system where anychange made to the single system database is instantly reflected andavailable to all application modules.andM;TEL ELECTRONICSandM;Mucho news from this callaccounting leader.andP;  Tel electronics (American Fork,UT) even has a brand new system available called INN-FORM Plus.andM;The system is one of the first systems combining business and lodgingfunctions into one unit.andP;  This is important, especially for people likehospitals, who in the past had to choose between a lodging or business box.andO;The INNFORM Plus also has an exceptional interface for property managementsystems (PMS), so it can backup a PMS, restoring calls on command if the PMSblows up real good.andM;Another piece of &quot;shocking&quot; news is that their new TEL-SENSE and INN-FORM XLsystems can withstand 20,000 volts of static discharge! That's a lot ofjuice, but these babies can take it and still not lose any data.andP;  Everybody'sexcited by this.andM;1990 has also seen the introduction of their INN-Front Management System - aproperty management system.andP;  It complements Tel's complete line of lodgingsystems nicely, thank you.andP;  It's software-based and lets you add modules forfront desk, reservations, posting and call accounting.andM;On of the more unique features is its posting ability.andP;  Although the PMS cancome fully equipped with call-accounting integrated into the system (byadding a module), a lodging property still has the option of using astandalone system such as the aforementioned INN-FORM Plus.andM;TELCO RESEARCHandM;Telco Research (Nashville, TN) announced its newest Tru System modulerecently - Advanced Inventory Management (AIM).andP;  AIM is the very latest inPC-based telephone equipment, work order and problem-tracking software.andM;The product takes advantage of a &quot;windowed&quot; interface  pull-down menus, mousesupport, pop-up windows, on-line help, etc.) to make learning and use a snap.andM;Inherent benefits include: user-defined fields and, thus, increasedflexibility; integration with directory and call accounting modules (theyshare the same database); problem tracking; work-order and stock management;helps users identify reliable equipment and vendors; and it's completelypassword protected.andM;The system produces a bundle of user-defined reports and all data files arecompatible with dbase.andP;  Overall, and this is nice, the system consolidatesbilling for all work orders, inventory, etc.andM;As PC-based technology has grown, users have become accustomed to softwarethat's easy-to-learn and easy-to-use.andP;  They want it with word processing andspreadsheet programs and they want it with more intricate programs likecall-accounting and telemanagement software.andP;  AIM gives it to them.andM;TELE-TECH SERVICESandM;Tele-Tech (McAfee, NJ) doesn't make an actual callaccounting system.andP;  Whatthey do is provide people with rate information so they can price callsaccurately.andM;They now offer instant on-line access to their information.andP;  You can get atlong distance rates, WATS rates, coin rates, local rates and time-of-daydiscounts.andP;  This easy-to-use tool allows the user to dial into their on-linesystem to either view or printout information in a very readable format.andM;All the rate information today's communication professional would ever need.andO;And they guarantee accuracy and reliability by updating their database on adaily basis.andM;In addition, users of TeleTech's on-line system can (again, on a daily basis)monitor updates that have: taken place;
