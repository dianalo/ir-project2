The benefits of these installationswere quantified in terms of allowable system cost (worth of the system),and the internal rate of return which could be expected from an investmentin them. The economic analyses were carried out using financial planningassumptions normally used by such businesses to justify capital expenditures.The factors taken into consideration in the analyses included photovoltaicsystem price projections, the existing and projected rate structuresfor electrical power (kW demand) and energy (kWh), the cost of moneyand tax considerations. The impact on the TVA power system and the localpower distributor were also quantified for each case to determine ifan incentive exists for utility subsidization of such systems.</TEXT></DOC>
