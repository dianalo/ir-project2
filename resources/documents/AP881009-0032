Donald Gregg, a 60-year-old retired CIA agent, studiously avoidspublicity as he labors in an office adjacent to the White House asthe vice president's national security adviser. It is a role hemight continue to play if Bush is elected president in November.   Gregg has survived lingering questions about his role in theIran-Contra affair, although his name surfaced again last month ina congressional report charging that CIA specialists ran a covertpropaganda campaign to arouse public support for President Reagan'sCentral-America policy.,   ``He's a loyal man, loyal to Bush, loyal to his country,'' saidretired Adm. Daniel Murphy, the vice president's former chief ofstaff.   ``He's done a good job,'' Murphy said, reflecting the view takenby Bush when he is asked about Gregg.   Madeleine Albright, a Georgetown University professor whoadvises Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis on foreign policy, said,``I think generally there remain questions about the kind of peoplethat the vice president surrounds himself with.''   The House Foreign Affairs Committee staff asserted Sept. 13 thatCIA operatives, along with military experts in intelligence andpsychological operations, improperly used the State Department'sOffice of Public Diplomacy for Latin America and the Caribbean, forthe alleged propaganda campaign.   The report said that on Gregg's recommendation, former CIApropaganda expert Walter Raymond Jr. was assigned to the WhiteHouse National Security Council unit that directed the publicdiplomacy office.   The staff suggested that the committee investigate whether theagents used the State Department ``as a cover for a domesticoperation which went far beyond the legal and ethical scope oftheir authority.''   The committee has not yet acted on the report. White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater dismissed the report as a rehash ofearlier allegations.   Gregg refused requests for an interview. Steve Hart, a spokesmanin the vice president's office, said, ``I think it's fair to saythat the focus is on the (presidential) campaign right now, and Mr.Gregg prefers that it stay that way.''   Gregg's name figured in other disclosures stemming from theclandestine sale of U.S. arms to Iran in 1985 and 1986 and thesubsequent diversion of proceeds to assist Nicaraguan Contras, at atime when Congress had banned military aid to the rebels.   In mid-December 1986, Bush published a chronology of meetingsbetween Gregg and Felix Rodriguez, a former CIA official andcounter-insurgency expert who was identified as a coordinator ofsupply flights to the Contras. The chronology showed they met atleast 10 times starting Nov. 3, 1983.   Bush's office has said repeatedly that it was was never involvedin ``directing, coordinating or approving'' military aid to theContras.   Bush called Gregg to task for failing to inform the vicepresident of his meetings with Rodriguez.   Fitzwater, who was Bush's press secretary in late 1986, said``Gregg apparently had taken it upon himself to put Felix in touchwith various people. He had not previously told the vice president.... I think the vice president feels he should have been told.''   Nonetheless, Bush has consistently expressed confidence inGregg, a 30-year CIA veteran who headed the National SecurityCouncil's intelligence branch when Murphy hired him to become thevice president's national security adviser in August 1982.   Murphy said he would not rule out the possibility that Gregg, aformer CIA station chief in Vietnam who speaks Japanese fluently,might keep his current job in a Bush administration. Other foreignpolicy advisers to the Bush campaign include former Secretary ofState Henry A. Kissinger and former national security advisersZbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft.   ``I'm sure he (Gregg) is on a short list,'' Murphy said.``There's no reason why he shouldn't be on the short list or nearthe top of it. He's done a good job.''</TEXT></DOC>
