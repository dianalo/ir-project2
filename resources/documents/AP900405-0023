Thomas Bryan, the prosecution's first witness in the fraud trialof Mrs. Marcos and Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, said Wednesdaythat Gliceria Tantoco did not accuse him of leaking the story tothe New York Post.   But she ``expressed regret that the information had becomepublic and said I should fear for my life and my family,'' Bryantestified in federal court.   Under questioning by Mrs. Marcos' attorney, Gerald Spence, Bryansaid that he was upset by the threat but that it did not deter himfrom further contacts with Mrs. Marcos.   Bryan, of Fairfax, Va., who was then a $27,000-a-year broker forthe Sotheby's auction house, told how Mrs. Marcos and Mrs. Tantocotried to secretly purchase the Park Avenue apartment and contentsput up for sale by Leslie Samuels, a philanthropist and artcollector.   The so-called ``Samuels Collection'' was among the purchasesthat Mrs. Marcos and her husband, former Philippine PresidentFerdinand Marcos, made with $160 million embezzled from theirhomeland, prosecutors have charged.   Earlier Wednesday, a lawyer for Khashoggi, once described as therichest man in the world, portrayed his client as a naivebusinessman who committed ``foolish acts.''   ``If this wasn't such a serious charge, this would be funny,''James Linn said. ``It is not the sinister thing that the governmentmakes it out'' to be.   Khashoggi, 54, is charged with mail fraud and obstruction forallegedly helping the Marcoses hide their ownership in New Yorkreal estate after the Philippine government won a U.S. court orderin 1986 to prohibit any further transactions involving theproperties.   Linn admitted that Khashoggi had signed a fake documentinvolving the buildings, but said this was intended to help aMarcos associate, not to defraud anyone.   Khashoggi was trying to head off moves by creditors to forecloseon the properties, Linn said.   In explaining the Saudi financier's frequent contacts withMarcos, Linn also said Khashoggi ``fell for'' a bizarre scheme inwhich Marcos offered him 10 percent of a shipload of gold if hecould find a ``safe port'' for the vessel, preferably in the Arabworld.   Marcos, who died in exile in September, supposedly intended touse the gold to finance a counter-revolution in case thePhilippines fell to the communists.   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is charged with racketeering, conspiracy, mailfraud and obstruction. She could receive up to 50 years in prisonand $1 million in fines. Khashoggi faces up to 10 years in prisonand $500,000 in fines.   Mrs. Tantoco, a longtime friend of Mrs. Marcos and owner of theRustans department store in Manila, and her husband, BienvenidoSr., former Philippines ambassador to the Vatican, also wereindicted but are fugitives.   Bryan testified that Mrs. Marcos offered to buy both the Samuelsapartment and its contents for nearly $14 million. A corporationconrolled by Mrs. Marcos acquired the artworks for $6 million, butshe lost the apartment when the cooperative's board of directorsrejected Mrs. Tantoco as the purchaser.</TEXT></DOC>
