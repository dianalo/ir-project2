Lucky punchessometimes win wars, and maybe this was the case. We had beenallowed into a &quot;safe house&quot; that, according to InteriorMinister Agustin Mantilla, had been used as headquarters bythe leaders of the Marxist guerrilla movement. The police haddiscovered the house in one of Lima's affluent neighborhoodsjust two days earlier. This was the undergroundorganization's central nervous system, commentedinvestigative Police Chief Fernando Reyes Roca, a short manwho is a consummate bureaucratic survivor. Interior Ministryspokesman Fernando Yavera joked that this find was going toput Shining Path watchers (such as myself) out of business.   Alas, as it turned out this was not the rebelorganization's headquarters, nor its central nervous system,but more of an archive and memorabilia repository.Nevertheless, it was a very important and unexpected policecoup against the Shining Path -- one that probably could havebrought dramatic results if President Alan Garcia had notdecided to make public the operation so soon after the firstpolice intervention, in order to score a quick propagandagain. This impulsiveness gave full warning to the guerrillas'entire clandestine apparatus, allowing them to limitconsiderably the damage inflicted on them.</LP><TEXT>   As Alberto Fujimori prepares to take over as Peru's nextpresident on July 28, the question of whether the ShiningPath will hound his administration as it has the previous tworanks high among his concerns. Among Shining Path watchers(&quot;Senderlogos&quot;) there is strong disagreement on fundamentals:Is the Shining Path getting stronger or weaker? Is it makingprogress or losing ground among the population? And finally,who is actually winning the war? There are no easy answers.   There is not much of a dispute on the basic data, however.The Shining Path went to war in 1980, on the same day Peruwas holding general elections after 12 years of a militarydictatorship. Its first actions were cautious, modest andoften ludicrous in a crazy way (like hanging dogs fromlampposts, with scribbled insults over them to ChineseCommunist martyrs). But the actions intensified and soonbecame quite lethal.   While President Fernando Belaunde's regime did what itcould to maintain democratic legality at first, it was quiteunprepared to deal with any insurgency -- especially with onethat had been meticulously planned and organized severalyears before the first shot was fired.   In October 1981, emergency laws were imposed for the firsttime on part of Peru; they covered only 2% of the population.Now about 50% of all Peruvians live under emergency law. In10 years, the war between the Shining Path and the governmenthas cost about 20,000 lives. Damages are estimated at $16billion, or about 85% of Peru's annual gross nationalproduct.   If the armed forces have been rightly accused ofsystematic violations of human rights (Peru ranks as one ofthe world's worst human-rights offenders), the militaryfaults the civilian authorities for failing to providemuch-needed leadership. Mr. Belaunde (the first to deal withthe problem), who tried to ignore the insurgency out ofexistence, is regarded as a well-meaning but inept leader.   There are no kind words for Mr. Garcia, on the other hand.In the first weeks of his mandate, he made several rightmoves -- like emphasizing his role as commander in chief ofthe armed forces and reorganizing the corruption-riddenpolice. But things began to unravel soon after. At first, hetried a liberal approach, looking for a dialogue with thefanatical Shining Path, and sending scores of youngprofessionals to the emergency areas to attack what he saidwere the &quot;root causes&quot; of the insurgency. But dialogue wasdisdainfully rejected: Dozens of these professionals wereassassinated, and the armed forces slowed down their actions,while the rebels made largely unimpeded progress.   Then, Mr. Garcia tried a tougher approach, andhuman-rights violations surged to their current level. Andfor the first time, death squads -- linked by some analyststo Mr. Garcia's APRA Party -- began to contribute to thekilling. Midpoint during his term, Mr. Garcia lost all hopeof defeating the Shining Path, and decided just to coexistwith it, says Rafael Merino, a respected analyst on securitymatters.   Not even in that was Mr. Garcia successful, as violenceclimbed steadily during the second half of his term. In 1988,1,986 people were killed as a result of insurgent orcounterinsurgent actions; in 1989, 3,198 were killed; and1,730 during the first six months of 1990.   How well is Mr. Fujimori expected to deal with theinsurgency? His campaign pitch advocated an approach closelyresembling that of Mr. Garcia's first year. According toFrancisco Loayza, Mr. Fujimori's adviser on internal-securitymatters, military actions against the Shining Path should besubordinated to economic-development initiatives. &quot;{Themilitary} should mainly provide security for developmentprojects,&quot; Mr. Loayza says. He stressed that the main thrustof Mr. Fujimori's &quot;pacification&quot; policies would be to addressthe &quot;structural violence {read: social injustice} that makessubversion possible.&quot; Mr. Loayza says that President Garcia'sapproach failed because of corruption and ineptitude. He alsofeels that the Shining Path is weakened, and that animportant Shining Path faction would be willing to engage inpeace talks.   This is only wishful thinking, according to Mr. Merino:&quot;If President Fujimori thinks he'll finish the war throughthose `pacification' policies, it will be like riding intobattle with no better dress or weapons than a tuxedo.&quot;   Actually, Mr. Fujimori might end up implementing internalwar policies that would be quite different from thoseadvocated during his campaign. At least, that's what seems isgoing to happen with the economy, where the vote-gettingpopulist message appears in the process of being replaced bya far more orthodox approach. Free-market economist Hernandode Soto, who has been advising Mr. Fujimori during the pastmonth, thinks that might be the case. &quot;He learns fast,&quot; Mr.de Soto told me recently, &quot;and he has all the rightinstincts.&quot;   Even if Mr. Fujimori proves to be a quick learner, he willhave his work cut out for him. Running against all majortrends of contemporary history, the insurgents have followedShining Path founder Abimael Guzman with the commitment thatthe faithful reserve for their prophet. This was evident whenwalking through their safe house in Lima. It looked, said aPeruvian journalist, like the seed for the future &quot;Museum ofthe Revolution&quot; -- wood carvings; woven baskets; tapestries;paintings; chiseled stone; all meticulously, lovingly craftedwith the mythified motifs of the internal war. There werealso the hagiographic representations of Mr. Guzman himself,in the various postures that endeavored to combine the heroicwith the intellectual. A whole closed, inbred culture,developed in the underground and unnoticed by most Peruvians-- except when it explodes in their faces.   ---   Mr. Gorriti is a Peruvian author and journalist.</TEXT></DOC>
