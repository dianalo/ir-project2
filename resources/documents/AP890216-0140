(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The fibers that keep corn on the cob, bestknown for sticking between the teeth, will soon be marketed to givea fiber boost to bread, snacks and other foods.   Mount Pulaski Products, using a process developed by governmentscientists, plans to make high-fiber flour from the corncob materialin about six months.   ``Our product has the ability to go into any food _ pudding, icecream, all baked goods, even junk food,'' said company President R.Scott Steinfort. ``Anywhere you want to increase fiber and reducecalories. The potential is astronomical.''   The new process will create a market for part of the corn plantthat farmers produce, but don't sell, said J. Michael Gould, a U.S.Department of Agriculture scientist who helped develop the processat a laboratory in Peoria.   The treated fiber is dried and ground and used to replace some ofthe conventional flour in breads, cakes and doughnuts. The materialcould increase the fiber content of baked goods by up to 30 percentwithout altering the taste or adding calories, Gould said.   ``We found we could make a white bread that looks, feels andtastes like any other white bread but which has as much dietaryfiber as whole wheat bread,'' he said.   Soluble fibers, such as those found in oat bran and most fruits,have been linked with lower blood cholesterol levels, according toKay Behall, a USDA nutritionist in Beltsville, Md.   The fiber in corncobs, and in most brans, is insoluble, ``butinsoluble fiber is known to reduce likelihood and severity ofconstipation, diverticulitis and irritable bowel syndromes such ascolitis,'' she said.   Gould said the process involves the use of hydrogen peroxide tosoften fibrous plant material and make it more palatable. Otherwise,consumers complain that the fiber creates a gritty texture, he said.   Mount Pulaski Products, which paid a $50,000 fee for thetechnology, expects to buy corncobs and other plant material fromfarmers near its headquarters in Mount Pulaski in central Illinois.   The company already processes corncobs into a material used inpolishing agents and other industrial products.</TEXT></DOC>
