 Geoff Squire, Oracle's senior vicepresident, sees applications as a significant new business line for thecompany and expects its contribution to turnover to grow from the current 1%to 2% to 10% or 20% in four or five years' time.andP;  This growth, however, willnot be at the expense of Oracle's traditional involvement in databases,software engineering tools and services.andP;  Rather it will come from theexpected market growth for applications which is expected to spur on Oracle'sown corporate growth.andP;  It is a well-known fact that the Unix market suffersfrom a lack of commercial applications and this is where Oracle believes itcan fill a need.andP;  Consequently it has announced its CIM offering called CoreManufacturing (CI No 1,282), as well as new versions of its Financial andPersonnel applications, and a new product, Oracle Payroll.andP;  At present allthese packages are available for DEC VAX/VMS and Sequent Unix hardware, butOracle promises future portability to the IBM personal computer environmentalong with hardware from Data General, Hewlett-Packard, Pyramid, Sun 3 and 4&quot;and others&quot;.andP;  Within its financial software offering Oracle has added sixmore modules to the original three so that the family of packages is nowcomposed of: General Ledger, Payables, Purchasing, Receivables, RevenueAccounting, Inventory, Order Entry, Sales Analysis and Assets.andP;  Features ofthis family include a financial statement generator, a generic externalapplications interface, and the ability to do statistical accounting andgraphical analysis.andP;  The updated Personnel product, which was hitherto anadministrative system, now has added organisational features so that, forexample, headcounts and budgets can be performed.andP;  SQL*TextRetrieval is alsointegrated in Personnel so that data, text and office communications are allcombined.andP;  The new product, Oracle Payroll, posts employee expenses toGeneral Ledger and goes live within Oracle on April 5 for the new tax year.andO;The company claims it is an international system, since the formula, which isdata driven, conforms to generic code, thereby enabling calculations to beslotted in to meet different national requirements.andP;  Then of course there isOracle's move into the CIM market with Core Manufacturing, an applicationwhich was developed with the aid of Oracle's partners Nottingham-based PafecLtd, a UK Value Added Reseller which sells computer aided engineeringsystems, McDonnell Douglas and Intergraph.andP;  As previously reported (CI No1,291), Oracle's first response to IBM's CIM strategy was to announce that itwould use its database as a foundation for integrating applications,databases and information in an enterprise-wide manufacturing system.andP;  As forthe present, Squire stressed that Oracle's packages have Apple Mac and Lotus1-2-3 style screen formats with pop-up windows and pull down menus, as wellas the flexibility offered via slot-in active data tables.andP;  After initialchuckling that Copics was part of the IBM CIM &quot;solution&quot;, Oracle retaliatedto the IBM strategy by claiming that the majority of machines in the factoryenvironment are DEC VAXs and HP3000s - machines where Oracle's products arein a very strong position.andP;  Indeed, Oracle also seems unperturbed by IBM'sAD/Cycle announcement, saying that IBM is using DB2 to educate mainframeusers about relational databases, and that until IBM has 100% share of theinformation technology market, all with mainframes running MVS, Oracle is notbothered.andP;  Squire pointed out, as an example of Oracle's dominance in thenon-IBM world, that the day after the Repository announcement, James MartinAssociates announced an Oracle interface for IEF to give IBM compatibility onnon-MVS machines.andP;  John Spiers, product marketing manager for Oracle UK,added that IBM's AD/Cycle announcement did not offer a satisfactorydistributed database, since IBM partnerships were not really a satisfactorysolution, leaving developers with a dictionaryless analysts' workbench on thedesktop.andP;  &quot;Cullinet of the nineties&quot;With Oracle, on the other hand, themetamodel resides in the workbench on the programmers personal computer.andO;Squire vehemently rejected the assertion in Cannes (CI No 1,294) that Oraclewas the &quot;Cullinet of the nineties&quot;, arguing that his company is sitting upand taking note of technological developments such as DB2, such asdistributed databases, and so on.andP;  Indeed, over the past two years Oracleclaims to have been embracing DB2 in both its SQL architecture and in itsCASE tools, and says it is able to build applications with its tools that canexecute in the DB2 run-time environment.andP;  Consequently, it is in a positionto offer users alternative technology within a distributed databaseenvironment if required.andP;  Therefore, it feels that the comparison withCullinet is unwarranted.andP;  As for the release of Oracle Version 7.0, this islikely to be later than predicted (CI No 1,284), since the company now saysthat founder Larry Ellison was talking of a statement of direction ratherthan of the unveiling of a product.andP;
