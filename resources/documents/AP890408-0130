(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Singer-songwriter Clyde Moody, a formerGrand Ole Opry regular whose country music career spanned fivedecades, died in a Nashville hospital Friday. He was 74.   Moody had been in and out of Nashville Memorial Hospital fortreatment of an aortic aneurysm, but never fully recovered fromsurgery several weeks ago to correct the problem, said hospitalspokeswoman Missy Hubner.   ``He performed the night he went to the hospital. He neverstopped performing and writing,'' said Aubrey Mayhew, who publishedall of Moody's more than 120 compositions and produced his recordsfor 20 years.   Moody, who left his North Carolina mountain home at 14 to playguitar, performed for President Truman after his ``ShenandoahWaltz'' became a million-seller in 1948. He wore out 21 Cadillacsperforming throughout the South.   ``I've never gone any place where I couldn't go back,'' Moodytold The Associated Press in a 1984 interview. ``I never mistreatedanybody.''   Moody, whose specialty was waltz music, got his start in 1934singing on a Spartanburg, S.C., radio show. He had many hits in the1940s and '50s, playing with country music legends Roy Acuff,Ernest Tubb and Bill Monroe.   Eventually he went by the title of ``the country and westernwaltz king'' and became a regular at the Grand Ole Opry.   Moody also sang with a young Elvis Presley in 1955 when Presleymanager Tom Parker paired them in a six-week tour.   ``He (Parker) wanted him to get some exposure and to meeteverybody,'' Moody recalled in 1984. ``He was a nice kid.''
