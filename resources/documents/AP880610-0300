The Arab oil exporters remained divided between aWestern-oriented group resisting a 5 percent cut by theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and a group led byAlgeria and Libya that supported it.   The ministers met during this week's Arab Summit here.   At a meeting in April, seven non-OPEC nations agreed to reducetheir exports by 183,000 barrels per day _ a 5 percent cut _ ifOPEC would implement a matching 5 percent cut.   The OPEC countries, which have a current overall productionceiling of 15.06 million barrels per day, offered to match theproposed non-OPEC cut barrel-per-barrel, but could not agree on anoverall 5 percent cut that would have lowered their ceiling byabout 750,000 barrels per day.   Algeria and Libya advocate production cuts while Saudi Arabiaand the Gulf emirates have defended their production levels.   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said theministers expressed the hope their differences could be overcome atthe meeting scheduled to open in Vienna on Saturday between OPECand non-OPEC producers.   The Algerian News Agency distributed a statement that the Araboil ministers had reached an agreement ``on the need for all OPECmember countries to adhere to their undertaking to respect theirproduction quotas and their defense of oil prices.''   The statement appeared to be an attempt to present an appearanceof unanimity.   The non-OPEC members involved in the dialogue with OPEC areAngola, China, Colombia, Egypt, Mexico, Oman and Malaysia. Norwayis attending the meeting as observer, while Britain is notrepresented.   The oil ministers attending the Arab Summit, which closedThursday, were those of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, the UnitedArab Emirates, Libya and Algeria.</TEXT></DOC>
