This is the first in a series of occasionalreports looking ahead to 1992, when the barriers come down.</TEXT><TEXT/><NOTE>By MORT ROSENBLUM</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Citizens can now buy a Europillow,emblazoned with a circle of 12 gold stars on royal blue, butfounding fathers are tossing fitfully over their dream of a singleEurope.   Halfway between the Single European Act of 1986 and the targetdate of Jan. 1, 1993, European Economic Community officials insistthey can blur internal borders enough to forge economic union.   But few people are talking about a United States of Europe, insharp contrast to the first days of Europhoria.   In full flower, the dream was to spring beyond economics to ablend of social philosophy, public policy and shared culture thatcreated a new extranational being, the European.   Reality has muscled aside rhetoric.   At Cafe des Amis in London, on the surface a sign of culturalshift, a French waiter was asked what coffee he had. ``Espresso,cappuccino and,'' he concluded with a sharp sniff, ``English soup.''   Early this year, the EEC Commission president, Jacques Delors,exhorted the European Parliament: ``We must give this communitymore flesh and _ why not? _ a measure of soul.''   But he has toned down the enthusiasm that prompted PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher of Britain to remind him, in a stingingspeech, that concepts like ``social gains'' were not on the table.   ``There is no question of a new personality replacing individualcultures,'' said Pascal Lamy, chief aide to Delors.   Three-quarters of Britons and Italians speak no second tongue,EEC figures show. Community business is done in nine languages. Inmost of the 12 countries, the predominant second culture isAmerican.   The process was never supposed to be quick, but officials nowtalk in terms of generations. Lord Young, British secretary ofstate for trade and industry, suggests 500 years.   Even such tangible second-stage aspects as a harmonized foreignpolicy seem beyond reach in light of acrimony over the fundamentalsof national currencies, border controls and tax policies.   Britain recently bounced back Delors' plan for a monetary unionto take measured steps toward a common currency.   Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative government also rejected talk ofuniform workers' rights and labor practices, calling that athrowback to the 1970s.   But President Francois Mitterrand of France, a Socialist,earlier this year defined ``backward'' as refusing to protect wagesand workers.   ``The most regressive and unjust laws must not prevail,'' hetold a crowd. ``France will not give its consent.''   Out of the public eye, officials struggle to balance sales taxeswhich now vary from 0 to 38 percent, a prerequisite to open borders.   An even greater obstacle to free movement are concerns forsecurity, especially in Britain and France where authorities watchclosely for possible terrorists or drug runners.   ``The last time I went through British customs they took my carapart like a bloody Lego toy,'' observed Val Gardner, a Britishmotor engineer living in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. `'That isnot likely to change.''   Few leaders are prepared to entrust security to any form of EECpolice force, which, in any case, could not be established withoutcomplex new jurisdictional accords.   Enthusiasm is mixed for the basic idea among EEC members, andeach is coolly assessing what it stands to lose. Every politicianknows, whatever his stance in Brussels, he faces voters at home.   A museum tour of any European capital shows the vast culturalwealth behind the dream, a shared sense of pride in the art,literature and music which shaped the Western world.   But a glance at the daily headlines suggests that a millenium ofconflict has merely been refined by modern times.   In April, for example, the annual French yacht race across theAtlantic was stalled by fishermen in the port of Lorient demandingthat a warship chase off an interloping Spanish fleet.   The Greens, a loose amalgam of European ecologist parties, aregaining fast on platforms that argue the single market will smashflat all the bumps and edges that make up European life.   They warn that small farmers and businessmen will perish if theycling to traditional ways _ or even if they try to keep up, in manycases.   ``They tell us we will gain 5 million jobs, but we'll lose 20million,'' German candidate Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorftold the Greens' congress in Paris to a tumult of applause.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
