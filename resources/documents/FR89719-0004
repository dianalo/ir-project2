VA is promulgating this rule because it realisticallyreflects the true net value of a property.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>August 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Mr. Leonard A. Levy, AssistantDirector for Loan Management (261), Loan Guaranty Service, Veterans BenefitsAdministration, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue NW.,Washington, DC 20420, (202) 233-6376.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Under section 1810 of Title 38, UnitedStates Code, VA guarantees a portion of the loan made to an eligible veteranto acquire or refinance a home, condominium, or manufactured home whichis treated as real estate under State law, or to install certain energyconservation features or other home improvements. The guaranty is a promiseby the Government to pay to the holder a portion of the veteran's indebtednessin the event of a loan default and eventual termination through foreclosureor other proceedings.On March 31, 1989, VA published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 13320) proposed regulations to revisethe definition of the ``net value'' of a property to the Secretary forpurposes of determining whether a loan holder would be offered an electionto convey a foreclosed property to the Secretary. On April 5, 1989, a noticeof correction was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 13703) to advise that the March 31, 1989,<T4>Federal Register </T4>notice erroneously stated that October 1, 1989,was the proposed effective date and that the change in the definition ofnet value was intended to be made effective August 1, 1989. However, tomeet the 30 day notice requirement under the Administrative Procedure Act,this rule is now effective August 21, 1989.A total of 22 written comments were received in response to the proposedregulations. Comments were received from 16 lenders (one lender submittedtwo comments), three trade associations and two secondary market institutions,all of which are involved with the VA-guaranteed home loan program. Most of the comments expressed the opinion that the proposed amendmentwould increase the number of VA-guaranteed loan foreclosures which resultin ``no-bids'', i.e., situations in which VA pays a maximum claim underthe guaranty and the loan holder must dispose of the property which securedthe loan in order to recover the balance of its investment. The commentsstate that an increase in the number of no-bids will cause substantialadditional losses to loan holders in foreclosure cases, and that such lossesmay have three possible consequences: (1) Reduced participation of lendersin the GI loan program; (2) more stringent underwriting and increased feesfor GI loans by lenders which continue to make home loans to veterans;and (3) insolvency for some lenders due to increased losses.We believe there may be some validity to the comments as to the potentialfor increased losses to lenders as a result of the promulgation of thisamendment. However, the amount of such losses should be minimal and lendersshould be able to reduce such losses through better and more aggressiveproperty disposal efforts. It is important to note that the losses incurredby lenders as a result of no-bids under VA's current procedures are notpredictive of the impact of additional no-bids which are projected as aresult of the amendment. Currently, when a lender acquires a property asa result of a no-bid, the property may be worth substantially less thanthe balance of the lender's investment which is unpaid after applicationof VA's claim payment. This is because no-bids presently occur wheneverthe net value of the property (which is 89.37% of the fair market value)will be less than the balance of the indebtedness on the loan remainingafter the account is credited with VA's guaranty payment. However, foreclosuresaffected by the amendment will be limited to situations in which an additional4.45% reduction in the fair market value of the property will reduce thenet value (which will be 84.92% of the fair market value under the amendedregulation) to an amount which will be less than the balance of the indebtednesson the loan remaining after the account is credited with VA's guarantypayment. Thus, every additional property acquired by lenders as a resultof the amendment will have a fair market value which is greater than thebalance of the loan indebtedness which remains unsatisfied after paymentof VA's guaranty.While the proposed amendment to our net value regulation will increasethe number of VA no-bids in the short run, for the long term it is likelythat a return to stability in major real estate markets may act to reducethe number of no-bids.Further, as noted above, actual loss increases to lenders should be minimaldue to the fact that all properties acquired as a result of this amendmentwill have a market value which is greater than the balance of the lender'sinvestment. We are therefore confident that relatively few lenders willbe seriously impacted by the amendment and that financing will continueto be provided to creditworthy veterans who have served their country andseek to take advantage of the loan guaranty benefit they have earned. Wealso note that VA does not require lenders to make loans which they donot consider to be sound; comments received indicated that some lendershave, in fact, already introduced more stringent underwriting and fee requirementsto compensate for a perceived greater risk in making GI loans since theenactment of Pub. L. 98-369, The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, which establishedthe requirement that property net value be determined by the Secretaryand used for purposes of deciding whether VA would acquire property inconnection with a loan termination. We anticipate that the competitivemarketplace will continue to dictate the most favorable terms for the extensionof credit to veteran homebuyers.A large number of the comments cited the increase in the percentage ofGI loan foreclosures resulting in no-bids from 2.9% in 1981 to 23.9% in1988 as being responsible for the decline in VA's market share from 13%in 1984 to 7.9% in 1988. We note that a number of factors are involvedin VA's declining share of the home loan market. Aging of the veteran populationreduces the pool of veteran homebuyers; high real estate values in someareas preclude the use of VA-guaranteed financing for home purchases; and,competition from lenders offering adjustable rate mortgages at low initialinterest rates gives many veteran home buyers an option they find moreattractive than VA fixed rate financing. We are unable to quantify theeffect of each factor on VA's loss of market share, or to gauge the impact,if any, of lender reluctance to make GI loans which results from the increasedrisk of loss upon foreclosure due to the possibility that VA will not providean election to convey the property. However, we are not familiar with anyrecent situations in which qualified veterans have been unable to obtainhome loans because of a lack of lender program participation and we donot expect such situations to arise as a result of this amendment.Comments were also received to the effect that the timing of VA's proposalto implement the change in the definition of net value is inconsistentwith the intent of the conference report on Pub. L. 98-369 for two reasons:(1) The report indicated that notice of any change should be provided tothe Veterans' Affairs Committees by February 1 of the year prior to thefiscal year in which the change would take effect, and VA proposes to implementthe change before October 1, 1989, which is the beginning of a new fiscalyear; and, (2) the report indicated there was no legislative intentionthat VA's policy of excluding the cost of funds borrowed to acquire propertyfrom the determination of value should be changed. VA has complied withthe conference report by advising the Veterans' Affairs Committees of ourintention to make this change. We do not believe that the language in thereport was intended to restrict the ability of VA to take timely actionwhen necessary to improve program operations. Our proposal is consistentwith the stated intent of the conference report ``to maintain the effectivefunctioning of the loan guaranty program and make its operation more economicaland, thus, to help ensure that the program will continue to be able tofulfill its basic purpose of assisting eligible veterans to buy homes.''The substantial operating shortfalls sustained by the program in recentyears have required additional funding to keep the Loan Guaranty RevolvingFund solvent. Therefore, it is critical that VA accurately determine whenit is in the Government's best interest to acquire a property so as toreduce the cost of operating the loan guaranty program. Far from precludingconsiderations of the Government's cost of funds, the legislative historyevidences a clear recognition by the Congress that the Government's costof borrowing funds is a legitimate cost factor for inclusion in the netvalue formula. There is no requirement in the statute itself that Congressbe notified by February 1 of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal yearin which the change will take place. Although the language contained inthe committee reports is not binding upon the Government, VA has notifiedthe House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees that this change in thenet value formula would be made, effective August 1, 1989. Most of the comments received opposed application of the proposed amendmentto loans originated prior to the effective date of the amendment. Someof these comments cited an inconsistency with the provisions of 38 CFR36.4300, which provides that regulations will apply to previously guaranteedloans to the extent that no legal rights vested under the regulations areimpaired. The existing regulation for determining net value does not vestany rights in the lender but rather identifies those costs and expenseswhich VA will consider at the time a determination of net value is made.Those costs are subject to change and are designed to reflect the net valueof the property at a particular point in time. This is the amount whichVA will require to be credited to a borrower's indebtedness and the amountwhich VA will pay to acquire the property if the lender elects to conveythe property to VA. The regulations do not grant the lender any specificcontractual rights. The lender has no vested right to require that VA continueto use an old cost formula when in fact the actual costs, required by lawto be taken into account, are not all included in the old formula. It istherefore our opinion that VA has the authority to apply the changed procedurefor determining net value to all foreclosures which occur after the effectivedate of the regulation. Other comments noted that loans have been originated,bought and sold at prices which were based on certain assumptions as torisk of loss which will be impacted by implementation of the proposal.We are not in a position to comment on the internal procedures used bylenders for evaluating their own risk in the origination, sale and purchaseof loans. We would note that the VA guaranty has always been limited toa specific percentage of the loan, not to exceed a maximum dollar amount.These regulations do not change the basic principle that program participantsshare the risk of loss upon default with the Government nor do they changethe amount of VA's guaranty liability with respect to existing loans.One commentator proposed that VA develop separate net value percentagesfor each VA field station, because property holding time (which is a majorfactor in the proposed estimate of the Government's cost of funds) variesbetween field stations; the same commentator proposed that VA adjust thecost of funds factor on a quarterly basis rather than annually to avoidundue influence from interest rate volatility. We think these are validissues. It is, however, necessary to use a nationwide average holding timefigure because some jurisdictions have post-foreclosure redemption periodswhich are required under state law. In these areas, VA's holding time isnecessarily well above the national average and use of local figures wouldtherefore reduce net values and increase no-bids substantially. This couldhave the effect of discouraging lenders from assisting veteran homebuyersin these states due to the unusually high no-bid risk. In addition, useof nationwide average figures avoids situations in which lenders in a particularstate are penalized because local market conditions have caused delaysin the disposition of acquired properties. The use of a quarterly costof funds rate would keep VA's value determinations in line with more currentdata but would also increase their volatility. Making the change on anannual basis provides more stability to the process. Moreover, use of quarterlyinterest rates and local holding times would create administrative problemsin the calculation and distribution of new value figures. Accordingly,while we agree that these proposals would increase the accuracy of valuedeterminations, we do not believe they offer sufficient benefit to meritadoption.Several comments were received to the effect that Pub. L. 98-369 limitsthe costs which can be taken into account in determining net value to expensesincurred by the Secretary, and that use of the cost of federal borrowingin the net value determination is precluded because the Government's borrowingcost is not passed on to VA when funds are provided to support the operationof the Loan Guaranty program. The law does not distinguish between coststo the Government which directly result from expenditures arising fromthe loan program and expenses which result to the Secretary in supportof that program. Those costs to the Government would not have been incurredwithout an obligation arising under the loan program and may properly beincluded when making a net value determination as to the total expensesassociated with acquiring, maintaining and selling property under the loanguaranty program. Additionally, the statute specifically requires thatthe Secretary consider, in addition to expenses incurred by the Secretary,``other costs resulting from the acquisition and disposition of property.''One commentator proposed that, if the amendment is adopted, the cost offunds should be calculated based on the percentage of federal operatingcosts which are raised through borrowing. The comment pointed out thatapproximately 90% of budgeted federal operating funds are raised directlythrough taxation, and only the balance must be raised through new borrowing.Applying that ratio would result in an increase in the percentage figureused for determining net value from 10.63% to 11.075% rather than to 15.08%.This argument fails to take into account the fact that federal borrowingis substantitally greater than the budget deficit for any given fiscalyear. So long as the total national debt remains well above the operatingbudget amount for a fiscal year, and this debt must be refinanced throughperiodic Treasury borrowing at current rates, any Government spending reducesthe amount of funds available for application to the current year's deficitas well as for application to the national debt. In this context, all Governmentexpenses are effectively being financed at a cost equivalent to the currentcost of funds.One commentator noted that the key factors in the net value determination,the appraised value of the property and the average VA property holdingtime, are not under the control of the lender. This observation is accurate;however, the purpose of the amendment is to take into account all factorswhich affect the value of property which may be acquired by VA. Some ofthese factors are economic influences on market value which are beyondthe control of VA as well as lenders. VA makes every effort to establishaccurate liquidation appraisal values through the use of qualified feeappraisers whose work is reviewed by VA staff. In situations where lendersdisagree with liquidation value established by VA, we are willing to reconsiderthat value whenever a lender can demonstrate that an adjustment would beappropriate. VA holding time, too, is a legitimate factor in determiningthe cost of property acquisitions to the Government. The fact that it isnot subject to influence by the lender does not affect the necessity forusing it when the net value of a property is determined. It should be notedthat improvements in the marketing and sale of VA-acquired properties haveled to substantial reduction in the average holding time over the lastfew years. We will strive to continue this improvement.Two comments were received which contrasted treatment of lenders underthe proposed regulation with treatment of veterans; i.e., that the reductionin net value would be applied by VA in dealing with lenders but would beexcluded from consideration when a veteran's debt to the Government afterforeclosure is determined. Calculation, establishmemt, and collection ofa veteran's debt is a matter between VA and the veteran based on the veteran'scontractual liability to indemnify the Government for the loss incurreddue to a loan default, and subrogation rights derived through the foreclosureprocess. The Secretary already has the right and obligation to considerwaiver or compromise of a veteran's debt under appropriate circumstances.This right is exercised independently of VA's determination of the amountof claim payable and whether or not to acquire property as a result ofloan termination since there is no necessary connection between these actions.These are two highly disparate areas of the loan guaranty program and thereis no compelling reasons for the Secretary to pass on increases in theamount of claims paid, which result from application of this regulation,to veterans.Several commentators suggested that increased costs to lenders due to increasednumbers of no-bids would result in more lenders being unable to meet theirresponsibilities to pass through payments to certificate holders on loanspooled through the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). Itwas noted that GNMA has already incurred substantial losses because lender/issuershave insufficient resources to meet their pool obligations when they arenot made whole by the Government in connection with GI loan foreclosures.We understand this concern and appreciate the fact that losses incurredby GNMA are as detrimental to the Government as losses incurred by VA'sLoan Guaranty Revolving Fund. However, as we have indicated above, it isour opinion that any increase in no-bids which may result from this amendmentwill have minimal impact on lender profitability and consequently shouldnot affect the operation of GNMA.A number of comments were received concerning the delay in promulgatingregulations to implement sections of Pub. L. 100-198, Veterans' Home LoanProgram Improvements and Property Rehabilitation Act of 1987, which areintended to reduce the number of no-bids. These regulations were publishedfor comment (RIN: 2900-AD39) on the same date as the subject proposal andare being published in final form in today's <T4>Federal Register,</T4> effective in 30 days. One comment was received recommending that VA mitigate the Government'srisk of loss under the Loan Guaranty program by increasing the fundingfee charged to veterans. The amount of the funding fee is established bystatute and, consistent with the beneficial nature of the program, wasnever intended to offset all costs of program operation. VA, as an executiveagency, is not authorized to act through the regulatory process to increasefunding fees in order to raise money to finance the costs of program operation.In addition, the primary purpose of this proposal is to improve the accuracyof the process by which VA determines whether or not to acquire propertyin order to reduce the costs of program operation rather than to raisefunds. In making the determination as to whether or not a property shouldbe acquired, all potential costs of acquisition and disposition need tobe considered. VA currently only takes estimated out of pocket cash expendituresinto consideration, thereby ignoring the real cost to the Treasury of borrowingfunds which are used to pay for VA's acquisitions. This regulation amendsthe definition of ``net value'' in 38 CFR 36.4301 to rectify this omission.By including the imputed interest cost of holding properties in inventory,the revised definition of ``net value'' will more realistically reflectthe true cost to the Government of a decision to provide the holder ofa loan the option of conveying the property to VA. This in turn will assurethat VA does not acquire foreclosed properties except when it is in thebest interest of the Government to do so. Under 38 CFR 36.4323(e), any amounts paid by VA on account of a VA guaranteedhome loan constitute a debt owing to the United States by the veteran.This section has been amended to exclude from the veteran's debt any amountattributable to the estimated interest cost to the Government for propertyacquisition and holding time which would not otherwise be included in suchdebt. VA does not believe it would be equitable to charge the veteran withthe Government's estimated cost of borrowing the money to pay for the propertyto be acquired.Editorial changes have also been made, to eliminate the use of gender specificpronouns, to assure the use of plain English, and to correct typographicalerrors in 38 CFR 36.4319 through 36.4323.The Secretary hereby certifies that these regulatory amendments will nothave a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities asthey are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612. Ineach case affected by this amendment, the loan holder will acquire an assetafter foreclosure which has a current market value in excess of the unguaranteedportion of the loan indebtedness; accordingly, we believe any increasedlosses which may be incurred as a result of this amendment will be minimal.Moreover, lenders and holders of VA guaranteed loans will retain the rightto payment of the full amount prescribed by law for claims on defaultedVA guaranteed loans. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these regulations areexempt from the initial and final regulatory analysis requirements of sections603 and 604.The regulatory amendments have been reviewed pursuant to Executive Order12291 and have been found to be nonmajor regulation changes. The regulationswill not impact on the public or private sectors as major rules. They willnot have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; causea major increase in cost or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographic regions; orhave other significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number is 64.114.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 36</ITAG>Condominium, Handicapped, Housing loan programs_housing and community development,Veterans.These amendments are promulgated under authority granted the Secretaryby sections 210(c), 1803(c)(1), 1820 and 1832 of Title 38, United StatesCode, and the enabling legislation.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: June 5, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward J.
