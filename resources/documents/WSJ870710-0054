The threat was aimed directly at Bavarian Prime Minister Franz Josef Strauss, an unabashed promoter of the Airbus program.    The FDP, the junior partner in the ruling coalition, is objecting to the transfer of part of the government's 81% stake in Lufthansa to Bayerische Landesbank, leaving Bonn with a 76% stake. The government plans to implement the transfer by giving the bank rights to an impending Lufthansa share offering.    The public-sector bank is closely linked to the Bavarian government, which some political observers fear would use its new influence to block further denationalization of Lufthansa. Mr. Strauss is a major opponent of denationalizing the airline.    Whether the FDP can summon up enough clout to stop the Lufthansa agreement is questionable. A spokesman for Bayerische Landesbank said: &quot;We still expect that the transaction will go through as planned.&quot;    The FDP's threat provoked an angry reaction from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's office.    Chancellery Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble issued a statement saying a disagreement within the coalition about Bavaria's plans to buy into Lufthansa couldn't be linked to the funding program for Airbus.    &quot;The federal government has taken clear decisions on further promotion of the Airbus program and it will stick to them,&quot; Mr. Schaeuble said. </TEXT></DOC>
