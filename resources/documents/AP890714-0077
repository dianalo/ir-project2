But the idea there is no contactis also one of Israel's most enduring myths.   Israel's government has worked out various deals with the PLOover the years, most notably prisoner exchanges and a non-aggressionpact in Lebanon in 1981. But even a hint in Washington of possibleIsraeli-PLO contacts raised a storm in Jerusalem.   Hardly had Assistant Secretary of State John H. Kelly raised theissue before a House subcommittee Wednesday when denials were issuedby spokesmen for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Finance MinisterShimon Peres, head of the Labor Party.   ``It's an absolute lie. We are not speaking directly orindirectly with that group,'' said Shamir's spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir.   Kelly's statement was the lead item on Israel television'sevening news, with all the official denials. On state-run Israelradio Thursday, there was an analysis of what Kelly had and had notsaid. It seemed more what he didn't say that raised the ruckus.   Kelly said, in answer to a question, that it would be an``exaggeration'' to say there were official contacts between the twosides, but that there was ``classified reporting about contacts.''   He added he could only discuss the issue further in a closedsession, suggesting there was secret evidence to support his claim.   Amid the denials, Yossi Beilin, an outspoken deputy to Peres,admitted Israel was having indirect contacts with the PLO not onlythrough the U.S.-PLO dialogue in Tunisia but through other foreignchannels.   ``For 2{ months, clear, official, unequivocal negotiations havebeen under way between the Israeli government headed by YitzhakShamir, via the Americans,'' said Beilin, who is deputy financeminister.   ``Whoever doesn't admit this, whoever tries to ignore it is likea small boy who closes his eyes and thinks the world doesn't seehim,'' Beilin said.   It should come as no surprise. Zeev Schiff, defense editor of theIsraeli daily Haaretz, wrote in April after Shamir visitedWashington to unveil his peace initiative that the trip marked thestart of indirect negotiations between Israel and the PLO.   ``Mr. Shamir may insist that Israel will never negotiate with thePLO, but he and his Cabinet understand that from now on theAmericans will shuttle between them and the PLO with proposals andcounterproposals,'' Schiff said.   The United States began its dialogue with PLO officials in Tunisin January, after PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism andrecognized Israel a month earlier at a U.N. meeting in Geneva.   Since then, Foreign Ministry spokesman have repeatedly said thatIsrael, to ensure against even indirect contact with the PLO, hasinstructed its embassies abroad to neither request nor receiveinformation about U.S.-PLO meetings.   But they have hastened to add they would listen to the views ofPalestinians elicited by the Americans, without necessarily askingwhere they came from.   At the same time, Israeli officials have been meeting regularlywith local Palestinians who are known supporters of the PLO, such asFaisal Husseini, to talk about Shamir's plan for elections in theoccupied territories.   Over the years, similar elaborate arrangements have been made toachieve contacts between Israel and the PLO.   In 1981, then-U.S. Special Envoy Philip Habib and Lt. Gen.William Callaghan, commander of U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon,shuttled between the two sides to work out a non-agression pactalong the Lebanon border.   It fell apart when Israel invaded Lebanon the next year, blamingthe PLO for attacks on Israeli diplomats in Europe carried out byradical Palestinian factions not linked to Arafat.   Prisoner exchanges were worked out between the two sides in 1982,1983 and 1985.   One agreement allowed the evacuation of Arafat and his guerrillaforce from Beirut in August 1982. According to Israeli reports, anIsraeli sniper had Arafat in his scope at Beirut's port but neverpulled the trigger.   Abie Nathan, the longtime Israeli peace activist, says he wasgiven official permission by then-Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, oneof the most hard-line opponents of the PLO, to see Arafat in 1982 totry to free a captured Israeli airman.   Nathan said the family requested he go to Beirut and Sharonagreed. He was unsuccessful, he said, because the governmentinsisted on tough terms.   ``Gen. Sharon told me to get him out without giving anything,''Nathan said. Later, he added, the airman was freed in a prisonerexchange.   Nathan, who operates a pirate peace radio station offshore in theMediterranean, says he has met Arafat seven times the past 10 monthsin his quest for an end to the Israeli-Arab conflict.   He is now facing charges of having contacts with a terroristorganization, which the PLO is under Israeli law. If convicted,Nathan can be sentenced to up to three years in jail.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   G.G.
