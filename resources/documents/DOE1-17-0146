Ultrasound-inducedhyperthermia has been used to treat a variety of subcutaneous tumorswith excellent penetration to depths of 3-6 cm depending upon power inputand crystal diameter. A new, compact ultrasound transducer has been fabricatedand tested in the laboratory. This transducer has been used intraoperativelyimmediately after an intraoperative dose of radiation. The authors protocolis to treat locally advanced, unresectable carcinomas of the pancreasor colorectum with in intraoperative radiation dose of 1500-1750 cGyusing a dedicated 300 kvp Philips orthovoltage x-ray machine. Immediatelyafter this dose, ultrasound-induced hyperthermia is administered usingone MHz ultrasound. Transducer diameter varies with tumor size and surgicalexposure. Treatment design is to deliver 43{sup 0}C at the deep tumorboundary for one hour. Multiple thermometry points are measured and recordedcontinuously. All treatments are administered under direct, continuouscontrol. The authors phase I data indicate that this technique is feasibleand further investigation is warranted. Technical details, temperatureand thermal dose, HEP ratings and toxicity are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
