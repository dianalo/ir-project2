The measure also would grant the SEC the power to overseestock-index futures margins, or the good-faith money neededto trade the products. The commodity exchanges currently setthose margins, with federal oversight only in emergencies.Treasury and SEC officials have cited low index-futuresmargins as causes for the 1987 and 1989 market drops.</LP><TEXT>   Index futures, currently regulated by the CommodityFutures Trading Commission, enable investors to bet on themovement of a basket of stocks without owning the actualsecurities. Trading in stocks and stock options is overseenby the SEC. While index futures are widely used by largeinstitutional investors to control stock-market risk, theyalso are used in computer-aided program-trading strategies.   &quot;The fact that we have separate regulators at this time ishistory,&quot; said Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. &quot;It's theway things started, but it's not the way things should be.&quot;   The proposal now goes to Capitol Hill, where Treasuryofficials say it will be introduced in the House at theadministration's request by Rep. John Dingell, the MichiganDemocrat who heads the Energy and Commerce Committee. In theSenate, Slade Gorton (R., Wash.) and John Heinz (R., Pa.)will sponsor both a free-standing bill and an amendment toeither pending SEC or CFTC legislation, the Treasury aidessaid. A Senate source said it probably will be substitutedfor an amendment Mr. Gorton already has proposed to a billbeefing up the CFTC.   &quot;The Treasury proposal improves on my original idea ofsimply changing jurisdiction,&quot; Sen. Gorton said. &quot;It willallow for innovative new products and strengthenedenforcement.&quot;   The Treasury measure, which took weeks longer to craftthan officials there had expected, faces something of a toughroad, particularly in the Senate. While the Bankingcommittees are expected to support it and the Agriculturecommittees will oppose it, many Capitol Hill leaders arecurrent or former members of the Agriculture committees.Those include Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.)and House Speaker Thomas Foley (D. Wash.).   Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), who heads the AgricultureCommittee, said he opposes the proposal and plans to fight itvigorously on the Senate floor.   The Treasury said the measure is designed for &quot;minimumdisruption to the markets.&quot; Stock-index futures wouldcontinue to be regulated as commodities under the CommodityExchange Act.   But the SEC would &quot;enhance&quot; regulation with securitiesanti-fraud provisions, such as the prohibition of insidertrading and rules that require a &quot;suitability&quot; test for asalesperson to sell a product to a customer. The agency,created after the 1929 crash, is designed to focus onprotecting the individual investor. CFTC oversight is largelybased on the premise that most futures-markets investors areinstitutions that need fewer protections.   A CFTC spokeswoman said the futures markets already havetheir own provisions similar to the insider-trading rules andsecurities-markets suitability rules. &quot;We are opposed to thejurisdictional changes,&quot; she said.   The Chicago Board of Trade also opposed the measure,calling it &quot;creeping regulatory imperialism.&quot;   But Mr. Brady, who is supported in the jurisdiction fightby the SEC, said, &quot;This is good common sense. It's good forthe American people, and it ought to be law.&quot; He said thatthe measure would allow for closer coordination among thestock, options and futures markets and that it wouldn't havemuch effect on program trading.   The bill also would carry out another long-promisedTreasury plan to change a clause of the Commodity ExchangeAct to allow products with futures elements to be traded onsecurities exchanges.   The Treasury also said that if the bill isn't passed, &quot;itis more likely that minor events will trigger major marketdisruptions like the ones we experienced in October of 1987and October of 1989.&quot;   That statement immediately brought complaints from Sen.Leahy, who called it &quot;false advertising.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
