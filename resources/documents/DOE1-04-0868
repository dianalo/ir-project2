The contributions of thedifferent types of oxygen exchange to the overall rate of exchange havebeen determined. The activation energies of the homo- and heteromolecularexchange and the bonding energy of the oxygen to the CeO{sub 2} surfacehave been calculated. It has been shown that the strength of the oxygenbond with the surface of the CeO{sub 2} governs its activity in the isotopeexchange reactions.</TEXT></DOC>
