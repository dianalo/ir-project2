These special modes, which we call ''dyadons'', havea highly anisotropic and low-frequency spectrum, causing the specificheat to change from a T{sup 3} temperature dependence to T{sup 2} atlower temperatures, consistent with anomalies below {similar_to}12{sup0} K in doped La{sub 2}CuO{sub 4} and in YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O{sub 7}.The low-frequency dyadons also account for the extended linear temperaturedependence of the normal-state resistivity. Due to the unusual anisotropyof both dyadon and electron spectra, vertex corrections generate a strongelectron-dyadon coupling at lower temperatures.</TEXT></DOC>
