The Hauppauge, N.Y., company today will begin a tender offer to its stockholders to buy back as many as three million shares through a so-called Dutch auction. Holders may specify the number of shares tendered and the price, which can be anywhere from $15 to $18 a share. The company will buy the shares at a price high enough to give it the three million shares it seeks.    Knogo common closed in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday at $12.875 a share, down 50 cents.    James R. Dellomo, the company's vice president for finance, said the maker of shoplifting-detection devices wants to let shareholders who need liquidity sell their stock, and also to enhance the holdings of those who remain. Knogo common traded as high as $29.50 early this summer, and Mr. Dellomo said many shareholders had been hurt by its dive. &quot;An amazing number of people I talk to never expected to see a bear market,&quot; he noted.    Mr. Dellomo added he didn't expect even a faltering economy to slow Knogo's growth, which has averaged 20% a year. &quot;We believe there is such a small saturation of this market, that a lot of people will buy (the company's product) even in a bad economy.&quot;    Knogo has lined up a $50 million medium-term bank facility to finance the tender offer, and has enough cash on hand to cover any additional costs, Mr. Dellomo said.

Co., United Asset Management Corp., University Science Partners Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
