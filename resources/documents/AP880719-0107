(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The families of three children killedwhen an elderly man's car careened onto a sidewalk have persuadedauthorities not to prosecute the man.   But Stanley Dlugolenski will have to give up his car anddriver's license in the interest of public safety, said Kent CountyProsecutor William Forsyth.   Dlugolenski, 79, told police he lost control of his car when thebrakes failed, but authorities concluded last week the Cadillacinvolved in the July 8 accident didn't have any mechanical defect.   The decision not to prosecute was heavily influenced by thevictims' families, who are Dlugolenski's neighbors, Forsyth said.   ``It's unusual for a family to feel this way, and it's a factorwe had to give a lot of weight to,'' Forsyth said.   Jody Murray, mother of 1{-year-old R.J. Murray, who was killedin the crash, said she believes Dlugolenski ``did everything in hispower to avoid (the accident).''   The other two children killed in the crash were Jason Northrup,9, and his sister, Marlene, 7. The three were struck as they playedon the sidewalk in front of their homes.   ``He feels horrible about what happened,'' Forsyth said. ``I'msure he'd love to undo what happened.''   Dlugolenski has had three prior accidents and told authoritieshis accelerator stuck in at least one of those accidents, Forsythsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
