Paul Simon said he will bypass the 20-state, Super Tuesday contests next month, probably dooming his already sputtering presidential campaign.    The Illinois Democrat asserted at a news conference here that he remains a candidate but that scarce finances will prevent him from making a serious bid during the important March 8 contests, which will determine nearly one-third of the delegates to the Democratic national convention this summer. Mr. Simon took this tack after poor showings Tuesday in Minnesota and South Dakota. He earlier lost in New Hampshire and Iowa.    He said he will focus on the states that hold primaries after Super Tuesday, beginning with the March 15 primary in his home state of Illinois, which he said he expects to win. But he acknowledged that he faces long odds by pinning his hopes on an inability of the Democrats to select a presidential nominee on the first ballot at their convention.    &quot;We do not have the resources for winning in the Super Tuesday states,&quot; Sen. Simon said. &quot;The campaign will begin anew after Super Tuesday, starting with Illinois.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
