McCarthyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MOTELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE)EARNINGS (ERN) </IN><TEXT>   Motorola Inc., riding high on the strong recovery of the semiconductor industry and higher sales of communications equipment, reported a 45% jump in second-quarter profit.    The Schaumburg, Ill.-based maker of electronic and communications equipment had net income of $80 million, or 62 cents a share, up from $55 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 9% to $1.64 billion from $1.5 billion.    The strong results were in line with the high end of analysts' estimates, causing Motorola's stock to rise. Motorola's price has been buoyed recently -- rising more than $5 a share on heavy trading volume in the past week -- as confidence builds that semiconductor demand will remain strong, analysts said. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Motorola climbed $1.25, to $57.375, in heavy volume of more than one million shares.    &quot;We're beginning to see the increased orders we've been hearing about show up at the bottom line,&quot; said Mona Eraiba, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. &quot;It's especially true for Motorola, which out-performed the industry even during the downturn.&quot;    The chip market fizzled in 1985, after semiconductor makers rushed to add capacity to meet customer demand that suddenly dropped off.    Sales of Motorola's communications sector, which includes large two-way radio systems and pagers, rose 10% in the quarter, producing a significantly higher operating profit for the sector, the company said. Overseas orders of communications equipment rose sharply. Motorola has been strengthening its market position in Europe through its 1986 acquisition of Storno AS, a Copenhagen, Denmark, maker of communications equipment.    The semiconductor products sector had a higher operating profit on a 13% sales increase. Demand was higher from a broad range of markets, except the military.    The government electronics group's sales edged up 1%, but operating profit fell, partly because of costs related to beef up compliance with tightened government regulations on defense contracts. The company has previously said it was subpoenaed for records related to a federal criminal investigation of the pricing and expenses of certain defense contracts and that the Defense Department is auditing the group's government contracts.    For the six months, net rose 36% to $136 million, or $1.06 a share, from $100 million, or 80 cents a share. Sales increased 12% to $3.19 billion from $2.84 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
