But two rounds of intervention by the U.S. and West German central banks served to check the dollar's ascent. In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8996 marks, up a fraction from Friday's 1.8950 marks.    Earlier yesterday in Europe, the dollar pierced the important 1.90-mark level, and dealers in Europe said the Bundesbank chose to enter the market as the dollar was retreating on profit-taking. The dollar's march against the mark is focusing attention on the Bundesbank's inability to defend its flagging currency in a foreign-exchange market that appears intent on taking the dollar higher.    The Bundesbank's intervention triggered a swift drop to around 1.8990 marks before the U.S. unit resumed its advance. A second round of reported intervention started after New York trading commenced when the Bundesbank, joined by the U.S. Federal Reserve, sold dollars between 1.8980 marks and 1.9000 marks. The dollar fell to its intraday low of 1.8945 marks as a result, but again staged a rapid recovery, rising above 1.9000 marks.    Toward the close of New York trading, dealers said the Fed again intervened as the dollar slipped from an afternoon high of 1.9045 marks.    The interventions are designed to discourage speculators from overextending their dollar positions. But analysts say global investors are brushing through the intervention in pursuit of higher U.S. interest rates, which many believe will continue to rise as the U.S. economy strengthens.    That worries West Germany's central bank. Bundesbank officials have insisted that a higher dollar will fuel West German inflation, currently at 1%, by driving up import prices. Moreover, it hinders Bonn's efforts to reduce West Germany's huge trade surplus by making German exports more competitive in foreign markets.    But so far, none of its defenses have blunted the market forces that are driving the dollar higher. The Bundesbank has tried just about everything. Market participants estimate the Bundesbank has pumped about $10 billion into currency markets with repeated interventions since last spring. It tried tightening mark liquidity with swap arrangements, in which dollars are exchanged for marks. It implemented a series of boosts in West German interest rates since late June.    Yet, at 1.90 marks, the dollar has risen 20% against the West German currency since the end of last year.    &quot;For the Bundesbank, it's been a fruitless effort,&quot; said Geoffrey Dennis, a monetary economist at James Capel andamp; Co. in London. &quot;All the economic figures coming out of the U.S. have been strong. And unless we see some bad economic data from the U.S. soon, we'll see the dollar at 1.95 marks soon. Even a two-mark dollar isn't out of the question.&quot;    The dollar also was trading at 133.75 yen in New York late yesterday, down from 133.88 yen Friday. In trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the U.S. currency opened at 133.62 yen.    Mr. Dennis said the dollar's latest push through 1.90 marks has brought the U.S. currency to a critical point.    &quot;Now it's at the top of the range set down by the old Louvre Accord,&quot; he said, referring to the February 1987 meeting in Paris in which the Group of Seven industrialized nations agreed to stabilize the dollar within a certain trading range. G-7 nations include the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. &quot;The Bundesbank and the Fed have now got to make a very concerted effort if they want to hold it,&quot; Mr. Dennis said.    But other economists note that the Fed has been intervening less frequently than the Bundesbank, which in recent weeks has entered the market with dollar sales nearly every day. From the market's point of view, they say, the Fed's occasional dollar sales are overshadowed in significance by its recent policy of tightening credit to keep U.S. inflation under control in a robust economy.    &quot;The main reason for the high dollar is that the market doesn't believe in an appreciation in the D-mark anytime soon, and because interest rates are working in favor of the U.S.,&quot; said Franz-Josef Trouvain, chief economist of Deutsche Bank AG. &quot;We've been expecting a gradual rise in the dollar, but what we've seen recently is an overshooting driven by short-term considerations.&quot;    The currency market, said Mr. Trouvain, believes the dollar will remain strong at least until the U.S. presidential election in November.    &quot;The trend has now become self-perpetuating,&quot; he said. But he cautioned that &quot;in a few months the market will see that such a strong dollar is not compatible with the U.S. foreign payments deficits.&quot;    Indeed, if anybody gains from the falling mark, it will be West Germany's export industry, which accounts for a third of the nation's gross national product. Economists at the Bayerische Hypotheken andamp; Wechsel-Bank in Munich asserted in a survey this week that the West German economy is receiving a &quot;fresh impulse&quot; from foreign-ordering activity.    The assessment helps explain why the Bonn economics ministry was able to report yesterday that West German second quarter GNP expanded by a real 3.25% from a year ago.    &quot;The bad news,&quot; said Mr. Trouvain, &quot;is that German importers will have to pay more for imports, especially raw materials.&quot; That, Bundesbank officials fear, could begin driving up Germany's inflation rate, depressing domestic demand.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $430.40 an ounce, down $1.90. Estimated volume was a light 2.2 million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Tuesday, gold was quoted at $430.60 an ounce.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Monday, August 8, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
