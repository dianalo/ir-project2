(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Evan Mecham should be removed fromoffice for obstructing an investigation of an alleged death threat,senators were told today during opening arguments of the first-termRepublican's impeachment trial.   But a defense attonrey for Mecham told senators in animpassioned statement that Mecham was the victim of a ``mutiny'' bythe state attorney general and director of the state Department ofPublic Safety.   Prosecutor William French said the man accused of making thealleged threat, former state official Lee Watkins, had claimed thatjobs in the Mecham administration ``relate to the amount of moneythat you were able to bring into the campaign.''   French said the evidence was ``overwhelming'' that Mechamviolated criminal laws and his oath of office and committedmalfeasance in office, ``any one of which call for impeachment.''   However, defense attorney Fred Craft told senators in hisopening statement that Mecham broke no laws and was acting withinhis authority.   ``What has this man done?'' Craft said. ``There's somethingwrong in this state when you can depose the constitutionallyelected officer of the state and throw the book at him ... basedupon evidence that's being presented by people who have a stake inthe outcome to have him ousted.''   Craft said the accusations resulted from a ``mutiny'' byAttorney General Bob Corbin and DPS Director Ralph Milstead. TheDPS includes the Highway Patrol and investigative personnel.   Craft also said he would present testimony that would cast dubton Milstead's integrity.   Mecham, who also faces a March 22 criminal trial and a May 17recall election, did not appear at the Senate on the second day ofhis impeachment trial.   The impeachment counts against Mecham include an allegation thathe ordered Milstead not to cooperate with the attorney general'sprobe of an alleged death threat by Watkins, then the state prisonconstruction chief.   ``There was an obstruction with regard to an ongoinginvestigation that was being conducted by the attorney general'soffice,'' French said.   Watkins has denied making a threat against Donna Carlson, aformer top Mecham aide who testified before the state grand jury onMecham's failure to report a $350,000 campaign loan.   DPS Officer Frank Martinez, a former member of Mecham's securitydetail who was called as the trial's first witness, testified thismorning that Mecham administration official Peggy Griffith told himabout a conversation she had with Watkins.   Ms. Griffith said Watkins had told her that if Ms. Carlson ``didnot keep her mouth shut, she could wind up taking a long boat ride... and I know the right people who can help me,'' Martineztestified.   Martinez said that he met with Milstead, other DPS officers,Corbin and several assistant attorneys general several days laterand that Milstead told of a conversation he had with Mecham.   Martinez said Milstead told the group that Mecham ``stated hedidn't want him helping the attorney general.''   ``The overall mood was just amazement,'' Martinez testified.   Craft said Milstead and other officials did not fully adviseMecham about the alleged threat, adding that Milstead ``was afeckless employee of this state and he did not serve that governorwell.''   French said Watkins complained about the job he was given byMecham and told Corrections Director Sam Lewis, ``If they don'ttreat me right I can bring Mecham's administration down.''   French warned the Senate to ``keep your eye on the ball'' andnot be distracted by any attacks on witnesses in the case. ``Knowthat this is being done because there is no defense,'' French said.   The opening arguments today dealt only with the alleged threat.Arguments will precede discussion of the other allegations againstMecham as they are reached during the trial.   On the trial's opening day Monday, the Senate strongly rejectedefforts to dismiss impeachment charges against Mecham.   Also, the Arizona Supreme Court was expected to rule today on adefense claim that the impeachment trial, the first of a U.S.governor in 59 years, should be delayed until after Mecham's March22 criminal trial on charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.   The high court last week refused to grant a temporary delay, andMecham said he planned to take the issue to federal court ifnecessary.   Senate President Carl Kunasek, a Republican, said ``it was thefirst-day jitters for everyone'' in the impeachment trial's openingday Monday.   ``It crosses everybody's mind _ the importance to do justice tothe governor and the state,'' said Senate Majority Leader BobUsdane, also a Republican. ``It's a large burden and we take itseriously.''   Senators refused to dismiss the 23 articles of impeachmentagainst Mecham, whose attorney, Jerris Leonard, entered an innocentplea on his behalf.   On 11 separate motions, the largest number of the 29 senatorsvoting for dismissal was seven. Several senators said the voteshould not be considered an indication that Mecham is likely to beconvicted, saying they want to hear the evidence first.   However, Sen. Jeff Hill, a Republican who has strongly backedMecham, said the governor's conviction was virtually a foregoneconclusion. ``I think that it's not likely that he's going toprevail,'' he said.   If convicted by the Senate, Mecham would be removed from officeand could be permanently barred from holding elective office inArizona.   Mecham, 63, won election in a three-way race after five tries.   He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and insisted he will surviveboth trials and a May 17 recall election and return to the officehe gave up to acting Gov. Rose Mofford, a Democrat, when he wasimpeached by the House on Feb. 5.</TEXT></DOC>
