Vickers' Chairman Sir David Plastow said the market fornew tanks in the 1990s, replacing obsolete equipment, couldbe valued at, &quot;on a conservative estimate,&quot; about #4 billion.Vickers also makes Rolls Royce cars.</LP><TEXT>   The latest order is for up to 130 Challenger 2 tanks tore-equip two British army tank regiments. Following theChallenger's strong performance in the Gulf war, Vickers hadbeen widely expected to win the order. General Dynamics Inc.of the U.S., Krauss-Maffei AG of Germany and state-owned GIATIndustries of France had also been competing for thecontract.   The contract marks a significant turnaround for Vickers,which a few years ago was threatened with the embarrassingprospect of losing out to a foreign competitor. In 1988,Britain's Defense Ministry recommended that the governmentbuy General Dynamics Inc.'s projected Abrams M-1A2 tank,because of the poor performance of Challenger tanks onexercises in Germany. The government, reluctant to take sucha decision without giving Vickers an extra chance, awardedVickers a #90 million contract to develop and build nineChallenger 2 prototypes to army specifications.   But it was the Challenger's performance in the Gulf warthat finally swayed Defense Ministry officials in its favor.From only 17.5% reliability in Germany, the tanks provedavailable 95% of the time. Iraqi targets were engaged anddestroyed at twice the distance previously considered viable,and none of the 170 Challengers was lost. Meanwhile, fuelconsumption was only one-quarter that of its U.S. rival, theAbrams M-1A1.   Sir David declined to give details of possible buyers, butanalysts said Oman has shown interest in buying Challenger 2tanks, while Sweden and Saudi Arabia have asked to test it.   St. Louis-based General Dynamics said it was&quot;disappointed&quot; by the decision. &quot;The British order wasmeaningful to us, but it is not significant to our businessbase,&quot; said Gordon England, vice president and generalmanager of General Dynamic's Land Systems division.</TEXT></DOC>
