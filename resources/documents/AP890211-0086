Some of the strikers have gone 20 days without food, and lawyerssay 13 have been hospitalized. A support committee said many were indanger of dying or suffering irreparable physical damage.   The ban specifically prohibited a protest meeting scheduledSaturday at a Johannesburg church by civil rights lawyers whorepresent strikers.   The order, signed by Police Commissioner Hennie de Witt, alsooutlawed all other gatherings protesting detentions or expressingsupport for detainees.   ``The banning is the act of frightened little men who fondly hopethat the problem will now go away,'' said the Human RightsCommission, formed by anti-apartheid activists last year.   The Hunger Strikers Support Committee, a coalition establishedlast week, said the ban ``will not prevent public expressions ofsolidarity with detainees. The issue is far too serious.''   ``The government's intransigence will only exacerbate the alreadywidespread feelings of anger and alienation in the blackcommunity,'' the committee said.   More than 40 Johannesburg lawyers started a 48-hour fast Thursdayin solidarity with the detainees. They had planned to end the fastat Saturday's meeting.   Many of the lawyers gathered at Johannesburg's Central MethodistChurch at 1 p.m., the scheduled start of the meeting, to advisewould-be participants it had been banned. Several dozen riot policewatched from vehicles, and a police video unit filmed lawyers asthey spoke with journalists outside the church.   ``The fact that the government sees fit to ban this meeting,called by lawyers to discuss problems faced by their clients, goesvery far down the road toward the destruction of the rule of law inSouth Africa,'' said Jules Browde, a prominent defense attorney.   About 300 of an estimated 1,000 people detained without chargehave joined the strike, which began Jan. 23 at Diepkloof Prisonoutside Johannesburg and spread to at least three other cities.   The strike is widely viewed as the most serious challenge to thepolicy of indefinite detention without trial since the governmentdeclared a national state of emergency in June 1986.   Some detainees have been held for the entire emergency, duringwhich an estimated 30,000 people have been detained without chargefor varying periods.   The government says it has not charged the detainees because ofthe difficulty obtaining convictions.   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok alleged Friday the strike wasplanned by outside groups and that some detainees had been forced tojoin it.   The Human Rights Commission said Vlok's allegation was ``not onlyludicrous in the extreme but an insult to the commitment and courageof these prisoners of apartheid.''   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no voicein national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy andmaintain separate schools, districts and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
