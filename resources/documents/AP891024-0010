Baker III for U.S. andSoviet negotiators trying to complete a new arms reduction treaty.   Baker singled out the deadliest missiles in superpower arsenals,capable of devastating an enemy in a surprise attack, during aspeech Monday in San Francisco. He also urged the Soviets to joinin a strategy shift to defense.   ``We want to see Soviet defensive military operations madehabitual,'' Baker said in his first in-depth description of theBush administration's goals for negotiations under way in Geneva tocut strategic weapons _ bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines _on both sides.   He said the United States would explore ``a cooperative andstable transition to a greater reliance on stability-enhancing,cost-effective strategic defense.''   Baker's emphasis on reducing first-strike weapons, such asSoviet SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles, signals a subtleshift from the Reagan administration's stress on across-the-boardstrategic cuts.   Baker made no reference to the 30 percent to 50 percent cutbackU.S. negotiators have been aiming for in the Strategic ArmsReduction Talks. Some analysts, such as former Secretary of StateHenry A. Kissinger, have urged greater emphasis on slashingfirst-strike weapons such as the Soviet SS-18s.   Designed to destroy an adversary's ballistic missiles in theirsilos, first-strike nuclear weapons have a potential of wreakinghavoc on the other side's nuclear forces.   Former President Reagan responded to a perceived Soviet threatby beginning a defensive program, known popularly as Star Wars,designed to destroy Soviet ballistic missiles in space before theycould destroy their targets.   Baker, in his speech, encouraged the Soviets to concentratetheir efforts on defense as well, while the Bush administrationpursues the Strategic Defense Initiative.   He said the U.S. goal in the Geneva talks was ``a newrelationship in which the capabilities and incentives to attackfirst are minimized and the possibilities of strategic defense arepursued.''   He said the Bush administration had tailored its proposals inGeneva to emphasize the relative merits of slow-flying weapons,such as cruise missiles and bombers that are not suitable for afirst strike.   At the same time, Baker urged a skeptical Congress to approve aWhite House request for $100 million to produce mobile Midgetmanmissiles. Otherwise, he said, the Soviets could exploit differencesbetween Capitol Hill and the Bush administration.   The House eliminated the request from the $305 billion defenseauthorization bill, but the Senate gave its approval for the funds.A congressional conference committee is trying to reconcile thisand other differences.   ``Congress needs now to support START, not undercut it, byfunding this program,'' Baker said.   Baker had planned to speak to the private Commonwealth Club onarms control last Thursday, but the speech was postponed because ofthe San Francisco Bay area earthquake.</TEXT></DOC>
