It makes him uncomfortable; it separates him from most of hisfriends.;    &quot;I feel the peace movement was a part of me,&quot; he said. &quot;It's aloss. It's part of my identity.&quot;;    But Lovell decided that this war was notthe United States meddling in a civil conflict, as he thought was the case inboth Korea and Vietnam, or interfering in the internal politics of CentralAmerica. This was the United States stopping a fascist aggressor, an assassin,a torturer who has killed thousands of his own people.;    It doesn't matterthat Lovell neither likes nor trusts George Bush, and finds his foreign policyunsupportable elsewhere.;    &quot;I think there are similarities to the yearsbefore World War II,&quot; Lovell said. &quot;No one stopped Mussolini. No one made amove to stop Japan from invading China, no one made a stand for the legitimategovernment in Spain, no one stopped Hitler.&quot;;    He doesn't buy the slogans ofwar protesters this time, arguing that they take a simplistic view of the roleof oil in the world's economy; that they underestimate the threat of SaddamHussein.;    &quot;I have a sense that everybody that's hitting the streets knowsvery little about the Middle East,&quot; he said, &quot;and less about Iraq.&quot;;    Thosewords had come to him early Wednesday, before the bombs began falling, whenwar was still an abstraction. Hours later, the words came harder, the realityof war almost too much to bear for a man who has spent so much of his lifeadvocating peace.;    &quot;I feel terrible,&quot; he said sadly. &quot;I think it's atragedy.;    &quot;I keep wanting it not to be so.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ALETA WATSON, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910117  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  410  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday January 17, 199100017162,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
