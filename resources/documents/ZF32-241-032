ShererandM;Segmenting, a common programming technique used to squeeze large applicationsinto tight memory areas, can now be automated and optimized with a new toolfrom MicroQuill Inc.andM;Available now, The Segmentor aims to boost program performance via a set ofoptimization algorithms that dictate the most efficient order for breakingdown code into segments, according to officials of the Seattle company.andM;Typically, programmers manually parcel up large pieces of code into segments,which are then swapped between memory and disk when memory is full.andP;  Theprogrammer attempts to group related code in the same segment to minimizedisk swapping, which slows program performance.andM;The Segmentor, designed for both DOS and Windows programming, automaticallyperforms this tedious process via its built-in database and the algorithms,officials explained.andM;The Segmentor's database lists the relationship of functions to other codesegments.andP;  The software then employs the algorithms to group functions intological segments, they said.andM;Another way The Segmentor attempts to minimize disk swapping is by keepingeach segment at a uniform 4K-byte size.andP;  This way, a large segment rarely hasto be swapped into a small memory hole -- a process that requires shufflingaround portions of code, the officials explained.andM;Using The Segmentor and some additional manual optimization techniques, RaimaCorp. was able to double the speed of its database query tool, db Query forWindows, said Mark Bowers, a software engineer for the Bellevue, Wash.,andO;company.andM;&quot;To sit there and segment by hand a commercial program that has a thousandsegments would be like hand-compiling a C program into assembler,&quot; Bowerssaid.andM;Aldus Corp. has found the program only partly beneficial so far, said RogerVoss, a senior software engineer based in Aldus' Dallas development office.andM;&quot;Our main EXE was so big that the segmentation ended up being compromised,but you should probably get good results with smaller components,&quot; Voss said.andM;The Segmentor costs $2,795; a version with source code costs $3,995.andO;MicroQuill can be reached at (800) 441-7822.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
