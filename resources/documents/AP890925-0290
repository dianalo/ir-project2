The sell-off began in hectic trading in Tokyo and was latermatched in European and New York markets in what traders describedas a rout for the dollar.   ``The market is shell-shocked,'' said Robert Hatcher, a traderin the New York office of Barclays Bank PLC. ``The manner in whichthe central banks conducted the intervention in the Far East andEurope today was extremely effective.''   The dollar began dropping when markets opened in Tokyo with thedecline continuing later in trading in Europe and New York.   In Tokyo, the dollar lost 1.4 percent of its value, falling to142.95 yen, compared to a Friday level of 145 yen. Later, inLondon, it fell further to 142.69 yen. The slide continued in theUnited States, where the dollar skidded to 142.13 yen in New Yorktrading, down 2.7 percent from Friday's level of 146.05.   The dollar also lost ground against the West German mark, theBritish pound, the French franc and other European currencies.   Traders reported heavy selling on the part of the centrals banksof the United States, Japan, West Germany and other major U.S.allies.   The well-coordinated moves were timed to back up a bluntstatement expressing displeasure with the dollar's rise in valuethis year. The statement was issued late Saturday by financeofficials from the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britian,France, Canada and Italy.   The discussions, being held in conjunction with the annualmeetings of the 152-nation International Monetary Fund and itssister lending organization, the World Bank, were hosted byTreasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Federal Reserve Chairman AlanGreenspan.   The communique expressed fears that the dollar's rise threatenedto abort the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit. A strongerdollar makes American goods more expensive on overseas markets.   Finance officials pronounced themselves pleased with the impactof their efforts Monday and said they stood ready to take furthercoordinated efforts if the markets try to push the dollar higheragain.   French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy termed the coordinatedintervention a ``confirmation and illustration'' of the new resolveon the part of the Group of Seven countries.   Karl Otto Poehl, president of the West German central bank, saidthat Monday's sell-off of dollars by central banks had been``obviously quite successful.''   He said ``we will still continue to coordinate with ourAmerican, Japanese and European colleagues in order to achieve theresults we agreed upon in the G-7 meeting.''   Poehl added to market nervousness with his statement, inresponse to a question, that hinted the West German central bankmight be poised to push interest rates higher in view of rapidgrowth in that country.   Many economists said they are looking for Monday's coordinateddollar selling to be followed later on by coordinated changes ininterest rates to further depress the dollar's value.   A rise in interest rates in West Germany and Japan would tend toweaken the dollar because it would boost the rate-of-return oninvestments in those countries in relation to dollar-denominatedinvestments.   The Bush administration has been putting pressure on the FederalReserve to lower interest rates in this country, a move that couldalso relieve the upward pressure on the dollar, but economists saidthis was less likely to occur given lingering inflation worries atthe Fed.   Before Saturday's meeting, the dollar had risen by about 20percent against the Japanese yen and 25 perent against the WestGerman mark this year. Those rises occurred despite a record levelof dollar selling on the part of the Federal Reserve over thesummer.   Some economists expressed the belief that the latest round ofintervention could carry more weight, especially if backed up laterby coordinated interest rate moves.   ``I think it is in the interest of all countries to push thedollar down,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.   He said that the Bush administration is worried that weakerexports could lead to a possible recession in 1990, an electionyear, while Bonn and Tokyo are both worried about the need to pushinterest rates higher to combat inflation.   Brady, in a speech Monday before the World Bank-IMF meetings,called for continued efforts to provide debt relief to more nationsunder the so-called Brady plan. He called this approach ``the onlyhope for achieving our common goal of extending prosperitythroughout the world.''   Finance officials from other countries said they still hoped toachieve agreement for boosting the resources of the IMF before theend of the year although the United States has made it known thatit was not yet convinced of the need to boost the lendinginstitution's reserves, known as quotas.   The IMF and World Bank meetings continue through Thursday withPresident Bush scheduled to address the gathering on Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
