The job-safety agency said yesterday that USX will pay $65,000 in penalties, half the $130,000 proposed late last year when OSHA cited the company's Clairton, Pa., coke works for 98 alleged instances of willful failure to comply with federal injury and illness record-keeping requirements.    Under terms of the settlement, the company didn't admit any wrongdoing. But the agency said USX agreed to correct records at all its facilities within the next six months.    OSHA said the company also brought its Clairton records into compliance with federal regulations and vowed to modify its companywide record-keeping practices by July so that they comply with guidelines.    Agency officials said the settlement was significant because the agency achieved companywide &quot;abatement of a safety and health problem&quot; without having to inspect every plant.    In Pittsburgh, a spokesman for USX's steelmaking division confirmed that a settlement with OSHA had been reached. The spokesman reiterated that in agreeing to the settlement, the company didn't admit any violation of OSHA's record-keeping requirements. USX wouldn't comment further. </TEXT></DOC>
