The New Jersey's skipper, Capt. Douglas Katz, said his57,000-ton battlewagon would probably have sunk the yacht had ithad not been dragged clear at the last moment.   ``If it had not been for that police boat pulling it off we'dhave split it in half,'' Katz said. ``The guy on that police boatwas very brave.''   The police boat managed to secure the yacht and tow it clearseconds before the battleship steamed by.   Other protesters in assorted small craft attempted to getalongside the ship and plaster it with anti-nuclear slogans, butwere kept away by a cordon of police and Australian navy speedboats.   Police and navy divers jumped into the water to arrest twoprotesters.   Katz, 46, of Bluefield, W. Va., said demonstrators, some of themfrom the international environmental group Greenpeace, risked theirlives coming so close to the New Jersey because turbulence from theship's four 18-foot propellors could have sucked them under water.   The New Jersey is visiting Australia with an international fleetof more than 40 warships to celebrate the bicentennial of Europeansettlement of Australia.   Anti-nuclear demonstrators were protesting the New Jersey'spresence because it carries Tomahawk cruise missiles. The U.S. Navyrefuses to confirm or deny whether the missiles carry nuclearwarheads.   The New Jersey, built in 1943, is powered by old-fashionedoil-fired steam engines. It was followed into Sydney Harbor by theBritish aircraft carrier Ark Royal and four warships of the RoyalDutch Navy.   Sailors from 16 nations will march through Sydney's streets onThursday.   On Saturday, Prince Andrew of Britain and his wife the formerSarah Ferguson will review the fleet from the deck of an Australianwarship, HMAS Cook.</TEXT></DOC>
