Police discovered the bombs after the leaders, members of theGuatemalan Opposition Representation Union, received an anonymoustelephone threat, said opposition leader Frank Larue.   The caller told them Thursday they had 12 hours to leave thecountry.   Larue and other exiles affiliated with the rebel's militaryumbrella group, the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union, havebeen in Guatemala since April to participate in reconciliationtalks called for by a Central American peace plan.   Guatemalan guerrillas have been fighting the government for 30years.   Employees at the apartment building in southern Guatemala Cityalso found flyers carrying death threats against the oppositionleaders littered around the grounds of the building, Larue said.   Earlier, they discovered a car parked outside their buildingwith the word, ``Leave'' painted on a box inside.   Larue said firefighters told the exiles shortly after midnightFriday they were alerted by an anonymous caller that the bombs wereoutside the building.   National Police bomb experts disarmed the three devices afterevacuating nearby residents, Larue said.   Another exiled leader, Rolando Castillo, told reporters he hadreceived death threats just before a coup attempt on Tuesday byrebellious air force officers and troops against the government ofPresident Vinicio Cerezo.   At least 10 officers have been jailed in connection with theuprising, which was put down by loyalist troops without a shotbeing fired.</TEXT></DOC>
