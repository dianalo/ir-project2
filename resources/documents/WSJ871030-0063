As an interim step, the committee also approved a short-term resolution to keep government departments operating through this Nov. 20. Nevertheless, the huge bill adopted yesterday will be the true battleground for allocating fiscal 1988 appropriations.    The measure reflects a nearly 3.7% increase from fiscal 1987, but in the case of the military and foreign aid, the administration faces cuts from last year's levels. Pentagon appropriations would feel the brunt of the reductions, falling to $266.8 billion, or nearly 3.2% less than in the fiscal year that ended last month. Foreign aid appropriations would be $13.2 billion-a cut of nearly $690 million from fiscal 1987 and nearly 17% from President Reagan's request.    Despite these reductions, the backlog of funds previously appropriated to the military will continue driving actual outlays higher in fiscal 1988. In discretionary accounts, meanwhile, the bill is an estimated $2.9 billion above the outlay ceiling initially set by the congressional budget resolution for the Pentagon.    Coming amid tense negotiations on taxes with the Reagan administration, this concession has angered liberals. Unless a compromise is found, the appropriations leadership could face a fight when the bill reaches the House floor.    House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) appears to have agreed to the concession partly to win conservative support for his larger deficit-reduction strategy, but it cost him crucial liberal support on a separate tax vote last night. &quot;It sure didn't sweeten it for George Miller and Marty Russo,&quot; said Mr. Wright, referring to Budget Committee members from California and Illinois who opposed the deficit package last night. &quot;I don't know what I have to do to satisfy them.&quot;    The Pentagon problem is partly the result of unrealistic outlay assumptions in the budget resolution, but the net result is to put the entire omnibus bill over the budget resolution by an estimated $1.6 billion in direct spending from discretionary accounts. None of these figures reflect the added costs of scheduled pay raises for federal employees, including the military, yet there is nearly no room left under the budget allocations to meet these expenses.    The very size of the omnibus bill makes it the target of amendments, and the skirmishes yesterday in committee indicate that the measure could become the main vehicle for a floor battle over the future of the Clean Air Act. There is strong pressure to extend deadlines that require scores of metropolitan areas to meet air standards this year, and a fight among senior Democrats in the House Energy and Commerce Committee has spilled over into appropriations.    Rep. John Murtha (D., Pa.), invoking the blessing of Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.), sought to extend this year's deadline until 1989, but backed down after being assured of an opportunity to offer the same amendment on the floor. &quot;There is a fine line between fixing the Clean Air Act and gutting the act,&quot; said Rep. Edward Boland (D., Mass.), whose subcommittee oversees the Environmental Protection Agency and who expects the issue to return before the House.    The appropriations process continues to take on changes in the new immigration law. Oregon farm interests succeeded yesterday in attaching language to expedite the processing of temporary workers allowed into the U.S., and another provision would prevent the Immigration and Naturalization Service from deporting any alien who became the spouse or child of a legalized person before Nov. 6 of last year.    In a blow aimed at the Reagan administration and South Korea, the committee rescinded an estimated $64 million from previously approved funds for the Seoul government. The action, which would wipe out most of the remaining uncommitted balances in the military sales program for South Korea, reflects anger at the administration's decision to restructure elements of the program without specific approval.    The restructuring benefits countries that have the economic resources to find alternative credit, and South Korea chose to refinance an estimated $652 million in U.S. loans this month. Rep. David Obey (D., Wis.), chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee, said the loss to the Treasury in foregone interest amounted to nearly $64 million, and he cut it from prior appropriations as a &quot;shot across the bow&quot; of the administration.    Though the House has separately approved 10 of the 13 annual appropriations bills for fiscal 1988, budget and political pressures have led Congress to group these together in an omnibus measure. With the new fiscal year a month old, none of the individual bills has even been sent to the White House, and the appropriations leadership prefers not to tip its hand in preparation for any confrontation with the president or demand for an across-the-board spending cut.    In contrast with the bitter budget debate on the floor, the meeting was filled with backroom good humor, as members added special-interest provisions running from a $28 million authorization for a Michigan highway bypass to one protecting American mills that provide the paper for U.S. currency. British mills want to compete, but the provision's sponsor, Rep. Silvio Conte (R., Mass.) looked to the Far East. &quot;Can you imagine having a dollar bill made in Japan?&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
