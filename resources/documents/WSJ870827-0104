The rate on tax underpayments will rise to 10% from the 9% rate the agency has charged since the beginning of the year. The new rate is based on increases in short-term Treasury bill interest rates since the first of the year.    The rate paid by the IRS for tax overpayments also will rise, to 9% from 8%.    The rate charged to people who underpay their taxes is to be three percentage points higher than the rate on short-term Treasury bills, rounded to the nearest percentage point. The rate paid to those who overpay is two percentage points above the Treasury rate.    Under the 1986 tax bill, IRS interest rates must be calculated each quarter. The rates for the period beginning Oct. 1 are based on Treasury bill rates in July. </TEXT></DOC>
