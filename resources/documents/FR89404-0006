Charges have been adjusted to morenearly reflect the current cost of providing the benefits and services,taking into account public policy and other pertinent facts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>May 4, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Charles S.

All 20 comments receivedon or before January 13, 1989, as well as those received subsequent tothat date, were fully considered before preparing this final rule. Thefollowing summary addresses the substantive comments. Many commenters believethat the fee increases are unwarranted, others believe that the proposedincreases are based on other than cost, or even should be based on otherthan cost. The INS and EOIR believe it is clear that 31 U.S.C. 9701 andOMB Circular A-25 require Federal agencies to establish a fee system inwhich a benefit or service provided to or for any person be self-sustainingto the fullest extent possible. We believe arguments to the contrary arewholly without merit. Fees are neither intended to replace nor to be influencedby the budgetary process and related considerations, but instead, to begoverned by the total cost to the agency to provide the service. A policyof setting fees on any basis other than cost would violate this principle.The INS and EOIR have therefore attempted as fairly and accurately as possibleto ascertain the cost of providing each specific benefit or service andto set the pertinent fee accordingly. The fee structure adheres to thecost principle.Several commenters were concerned above the effects of fee increases oncertain segments of the student population. However, in view of the substantialfinancial commitment that is necessary to seek an education in the UnitedStates, it is not likely to influence educational decisions. Several commentersaver that the proposed rule did not publish the study upon which the proposedfee increases were based, and that this study was not made available forpublic inspection and analyses. This is not the case. This study has alwaysbeen available upon request, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act,5 U.S.C. 552. No requests were received.Since the regulations already provide for the waiver of a fee when it isshown that the recipient is unable to pay, the new fee schedule does notprohibit applications or requests on the basis of the inability to payas some of the commenters suggested. Furthermore, several fees are at lessthan full cost recovery recognizing long-standing public policy and theinterest served by these processes. Accordingly, the following fee changesare adopted as proposed. In addition, this rule includes minor technicalcharges to update the existing fee schedule by removing Forms N-580 andN-604.1.
