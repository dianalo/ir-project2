But Col. Phanom Jinavijarana of the northeastern Burapa FieldForce said about 29,000 Vietnamese troops have retreated up to 20miles from the Thai-Cambodian border.   Two other regional field forces, however, interpreted recentVietnamese troop movements inside Cambodia as regular trooprotations and reinforcements.   ``Fresh units being sent to free others near the (Thai-Cambodia)border would suggest Vietnam's new readiness to engage in escalatedfighting with the Cambodian resistance groups,'' Lt. Patana Jiranantof the eastern Chantaburi-Trat Field Force told a monthly newsconference.   Western analysts say more than 100,000 Vietnamese troops are inCambodia fighting a three-party resistance coalition of the KhmerRouge and two non-communist groups. Hanoi pledged to pull out allits forces by 1990.   Fighting is expected to intensify over the next several months,said Supreme Command spokesman Lt. Gen. Naruedol Dejpradiyuth.   Shells from fighting that began in early October have landedinside six Thai border provinces, killing and wounding anunspecified number of Thais, Naruedol said. He added that the dryseason has made it easier for warring groups to transport arms andrapidly mobilize their troops.   Naruedol said Vietnamese forces continued to pursue and ambushthe resistance forces, with skirmishes in Cambodia's westernprovinces of Battambang, Siem Reap, Oddar Meanchey and Pursat.   The Vietnamese, he said, also had taken positions on strategichills and built roads to facilitate troop deployment.   Naruedol expressed skepticism over a recent Laotian claim thatall Vietnamese troops in communist Laos had returned to Vietnam.   He was responding to a statement Tuesday by Laos' Deputy ForeignMinister Soubanh Sarithirat who told Thai reporters in Vientianethat all Hanoi's troops had left that country.</TEXT></DOC>
