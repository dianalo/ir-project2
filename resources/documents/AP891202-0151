(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The American Civil Liberties Union on Fridaydecried a county sheriff's policy that forces homosexual jailinmates to wear pink bracelets.   ``It reflects homophobia,'' said Jim Green, an ACLU attorney inWest Palm Beach. ``Labeling people's clothing based on a sexualpreference seems an extreme response to a situation that doesn'twarrant it.''   For at least 15 years, homosexual inmates at the Polk CountyJail have been kept separate from other inmates and labeled withpink wrist bands. The sheriff says it's for their own safety.   ``All hell would break loose'' in the prison if homosexuals wereallowed to mix with the general population, said Sheriff LawrenceW. Crow Jr. ``If this system wasn't needed for their ownprotection, I'd change it in a minute.''   Crow said homosexual inmates are often the targets of ridiculeand beatings, so jailers ask all inmates their sexual preferencewhen they enter the facility.   If the inmate says he is homosexual, ``he is given a wrist bandand kept separate from the general population,'' said sheriff'sspokeswoman Lynne Breidenbach. ``If we find out things later andhave probable cause that he's a homosexual, then we put the wristband on.''   Ms. Breidenbach said different colored bands are used todistinguish inmates for other reasons, such as green forescape-risk inmates. She said there was no special reason pink waschosen to distinguish homosexuals.   ``It's really an off-red,'' she said. ``That's just the colorthat was available.''   The county jail has 1,199 inmates, of which 25 to 35 are wearingbracelets identifying them as homosexuals, Breidenbach said.   ACLU attorney Green said he is studying possible civil action tohave the practice stopped as unconstitutional. He cited a case inIndiana two years ago in which a federal court ruled againstsegregation of homosexual inmates.   Kirk Warren, the sheriff's legal counsel, said Thursday thepractice of labeling inmates is legal and ``in the best interest ofthe safety of all the inmates.''   The sheriff, while not acknowledging complaints from inmates orthe ACLU, said he has been looking into switching the colored bandsto bands that have bar codes similar to those used in supermarkets.   Waving a scanner over the bracelets would tell staff memberswhether inmates have medical problems or are wanted in anothercounty, according to Crow, who said no immediate plans have beenmade to switch to the system.   While bands with bar codes would be an improvement, they're nota solution, ACLU officials said.   Robyn Blumner, executive director for Florida's ACLU, describedthe bar codes as ``more palatable than pink tags.'' But shemaintained that sexual orientation shouldn't have anything to dowith inmate classifications.   ``Predator inmates should be separated from victim inmates, butsexual preference should have nothing to do with it,'' she said.   Gays who seek protection from others should be granted it,Blumner said, but only at their choice _ not the sheriff's.   Blumner said six lesbian inmates have written to her withcomplaints that being ``pink tagged'' has limited their privilegesand brought harsh treatment from corrections officers.   Crow denies the charges.</TEXT></DOC>
