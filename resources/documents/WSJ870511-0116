Government officials also said they expect an unemployment rate of 9%, despite earlier forecasts of an 8.5% rate.    No explanation was given for the revisions. But Economics Minister Martin Bangemann last week blamed less-favorable German economic prospects on the U.S. dollar's decline, which makes German products less competitive abroad and weakens corporate financial results that are converted from dollars into marks.    Many economists have warned of a slowdown in the German economy. According to the latest estimates from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, German economic growth will average between 1.5% and 2% in 1987 and 1988.    Bonn is expected to come under fire from other OECD members during a ministerial meeting in Paris this week for not doing more to act as an economic locomotive for other countries. </TEXT></DOC>
