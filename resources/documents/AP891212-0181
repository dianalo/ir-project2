Smith HighSchool, an all-boys vocational school with a reputation as a quietplace, a ``safe'' school.   ``Junior'' was shot to death outside the school cafeteria Nov.14; a 15-year-old classmate was charged. The two were playing witha .22-caliber pistol when it accidentally went off, police said.   ``There are plenty of safe schools all over the city where kidsare sitting there with guns in their bookbags. They just haven'tdecided to shoot yet,'' said Ed Muir, of the United Federation ofTeachers, the teachers union.   ``Junior's'' was the first killing in a city school since 1978.But in a system where violence is routine, it caused little uproaramong students.   ``The thing that everyone was taken aback by is that the kidsseem to be taking this so calmly. It's just another kid whacked,''said Muir.   Bruce Irushalmi, director of the Board of Education Office ofSchool Safety, said students ``bring guns to school because theydon't feel safe going to and from school. ... They say they needthem to create a balance of power.''   Muir is more cynical. ``Some kids feel they actually need it forprotection, and some are businessmen who have large quantities ofcash and thought it the prudent thing not to apply for a pistolpermit.''   From September 1988 to June 1989, 1,854 weapons were seized atschools, ranging from razor-edged box cutters to automatic weapons.At 15 schools where roving teams of security guards used metaldetectors, five guns and 815 other weapons were confiscated duringthe 1988-1989 school year _ a year that saw 1,356 studentsassaulted, 183 robbed, 78 sexually assaulted and 105 caught usingcontrolled substances. Figures for this year were unavailable.   To balance the arms race, New York City spent $62 million onsecurity in 1988, about 1 percent of the $7 billion budget. Metaldetectors accounted for about $4 million of that; the restsupported 2,450 uniformed, but unarmed, security guards who policea system with just under a million students.   ``If we were a police force, we would be the 10th largest policeforce in the country,'' Irushalmi said.   To Muir, it isn't enough. He cites the increase in gun incidents_ twice a week last year, 19 in the first 34 school days of thisyear _ as evidence that the city's schools are dangerous places tobe. Figures kept by his union show a 5 percent increase in crimeinside schools during the 1988-89 school year.   Preliminary figures for 1989 showed an 11 percent increase inschool crime in September, and Muir said 44 teachers were assaultedduring the first month of school this fall, compared to 27 duringSeptember 1988.   But Irushalmi, whose two children attend public schools, saysthe problem is not inside the buildings. Reports of violence insideschools have fallen from 15,000 a year in 1981 to 9,000 in 1988-89.Outside is another story.   ``For anyone under 18 this is Dodge City and you have to carry apiece,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, we don't have Miss Kitty at theLong Branch to make sure you check your piece at the door.''   In one corner of this Dodge City, outside Prospect Heights HighSchool in Brooklyn, a student was shot on the very first day ofschool.   ``There's no safety in Prospect Heights,'' despite spot checkswith metal detectors, said Bob ``Brother'' Abu, 15. ``If they don'tcome on Monday, they put the weapons in their lockers. So when theweapon detectors come on Wednesday, they have their weapons in theschool already.''   ``There ain't no safety,'' said his 17-year-old friend, whoidentified himself as Carl, or Shrapnel Insepticon, a senior atErasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn. He wore a blue bandana overhis lower face, Jesse James style, and said he was a member of theDecepticons, a teen-age street gang named after evil characters in``The Transformers,'' a cartoon show.   The loosely knit gang, which has taken to bandanas asidentification, has been accused of taking part in Halloweenrampages on Manhattan's East Side, as well as in wolfpack-typeattacks on students at bus and subway stations.   More than 100,000 students stayed away from school on Halloween,apparently out of fear; more than 250 high school-age youths werearrested as they roamed the city, robbing, intimidating andassaulting pedestrians and merchants.   Muir and the UFT have proposed some remedies: metal detectors inevery school, a police liaison for junior high schools, stifferpenalties for anyone caught with guns. But these steps, all agree,will not solve the underlying problems that lead to school violence.   ``The schools are a mirror of society,'' Irushalmi said, citingdrugs and crime, the easy availability of weapons, ``the diminutionof values.''   ``These kids don't distinguish between the schools and thestreets,'' Muir said. ``They don't see any difference.''   ``We really think it's related to drugs. Part of it has to dowith the sales, but another part is a lot of the kid's parents areusing drugs, and the kids are acting out,'' said Gretchen Rausch,an assistant commissioner of the Probation Department who began hercareer as a probation officer in 1967.   Arrests of kids ages 7 to 16 jumped 27 percent from 1987 to1988, she said.   But the kids say there is no simple reason why they prey uponeach other and their teachers.   Sean Chittick, 17, is a senior at Murry Bergtraum High School,located across from police headquarters and regarded by many as oneof the city's safer schools. Still, he sees violence all aroundhim, and he is mystified.   ``It just be happening for no type of reason,'' he said. ``Nowthey just be killing them for gold jewelry, or `You lookin' at mygirl.'''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tuesday AMs, Dec. 19</NOTE></DOC>
