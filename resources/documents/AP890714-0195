MANIAM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Authorities are barring Vietnameseboat people from landing in this country, and at least 16 boats withnearly 900 people have been sent away to Indonesia, a U.N. officialsaid Friday.   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees ``is surprised anddisappointed'' in the new policy, said the agency's localrepresentative, Jean Marie Fakhouri. The new Malaysian policy beganaround May 25 without any notice to the U.N. agency.   Malaysian officials were not available to respond to Fakhouri'scriticism, but Foreign Minister Abu Hassan Omar and other officialshave said repeatedly over the past few months that Malaysia wasgetting fed up with the crush of Vietnamese refugees.   Malaysia now has 22,000 of them, down from a peak of 76,500 inJune 1979.   Speaking in a telephone interview, Fakhouri said officials of theU.N. agency do not know exactly how many boats that landed inMalaysia have been towed back out to sea.   But he said at least 16 boats with 886 people have been sent away.   He said those boats were towed away between the end of May,shortly after the new policy went into effect, and July 7. However,he said the policy apparently is continuing.   He said in one incident in mid-June, a boat with about 40refugees capsized as it was being towed to the South China Sea offthe east coast of this Southeast Asian country.   A 23-year-old refugee drowned, but the others in the boat werepicked up, put into another boat a week later, and towed away,Fakhouri said.   He said that so far, all the expelled boats appear to have landedin nearby Indonesia. He said Indonesian authorities were allowingthe refugees to stay.   On March 14, joining other members of the Association ofSoutheast Asian Nations, Malaysia imposed a policy of screening boatpeople to find those who were simply economic refugees. Such peoplewould then be sent back to Vietnam.   However, Vietnam has said repatriation must be voluntary.   Malaysia is still adhering to its policy of allowing temporaryasylum to refugees already here. They are to be permanentlyresettled in the United States, Australia, Canada and othercountries.   In 1979, Malaysia officials also towed some boats away, but theystopped after a few weeks when Western nations promised to take moreboat people.</TEXT></DOC>
