But Newsweek, hearing that other publications were chasing the story, continued to pursue the matter.    Eventually, the reporter reached George Bush Jr. at his father's campaign headquarters. The younger Mr. Bush said he had asked his father about the rumors, and &quot;The answer to the Big A question is N.O.&quot;    The magazine decided to print the offhand response as a two-paragraph item in its weekly gossip column, Periscope. &quot;The media all over town were curious as to how to deal with the rumor,&quot; explains Newsweek's top political reporter, Howard Fineman. &quot;Once we got the son and namesake of the vice president saying he asked his dad about the rumor, it was too newsworthy to pass up.&quot;    Since the collapse of Gary Hart's campaign in the wake of the Miami Herald story linking him to model Donna Rice, the nation's media have been debating whether the sexual conduct of political candidates is news. Political reporters and editors are struggling to determine if they want to report -- or even to investigate -- the sex lives of presidential aspirants, an area that has traditionally been off-limits to journalists. And they are all looking over their shoulders to see what their competition is doing on the subject.    &quot;Gary Hart changes the rules of the game for the press and political candidates,&quot; says Howard Simons, curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University. &quot;For the press, sex is no longer something you titter at among yourselves, because it's proven to be a critical issue. For candidates, it suggests you better be who you parade yourself to be.&quot;    For journalists, &quot;it's an awkward subject,&quot; says Craig Whitney, Washington bureau chief of the New York Times. &quot;In the area of private life and morals, it's less easy to decide what is legitimate news and what is gossip.&quot;    Some suggest that the Herald's stakeout of Mr. Hart's town house may turn out to be the peak of the press's pursuit of the issue. Ben Bagdikian, dean of the journalism graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, says he hopes that the Gary Hart incident would be the turning point &quot;of an unfortunate trend in the coverage of presidential candidates in recent years that has moved away from a look at issues and records and instead to their personalities and private lives.&quot;    Yet the threat of such press scrutiny reportedly has discouraged several candidates from running, and other stories followed the Herald expose. Shortly after Mr. Hart ended his campaign, for instance, a reporter at a news conference asked Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, &quot;Is there anything in your personal life that might preclude you from being president, much in the same way that it has Gary Hart?&quot; After Gov. Celeste said, &quot;No,&quot; the Cleveland Plain Dealer published a page-one story the next day headlined, &quot;Celeste womanizing worries aides; links to three women may imperil presidential ambitions.&quot;    Executive editor William Woestendiek says the Plain Dealer had been pursuing the story for some time, and decided to run with it when the governor &quot;flatly denied what we knew to be true. We thought that showed an arrogance and character flaw the readers should know about.&quot;    But other editors say one factor in deciding whether to publish an alleged affair should be whether it is a current or past involvement. &quot;I don't think the issue of Gov. Celeste's past relationships had the currency and immediacy that the Gary Hart story had,&quot; says Peter Weitzel, Miami Herald managing editor.    Several large newspapers say they are actively investigating sex-related rumors about presidential candidates, according to editors and reporters at those papers. Other news organizations, including this newspaper, have held meetings to discuss whether reporters are becoming &quot;character cops&quot; or are pursuing legitimate news stories.    &quot;Generally, private lives ought to remain private,&quot; says Norman Pearlstine, managing editor of The Wall Street Journal. &quot;But a presidential candidate is more open to public scrutiny than almost anyone else, especially if the private life is so much at variance with public posturing that it goes to the character of the candidate.&quot;    All three major television networks and some major newspapers have decided not to pursue rumors of candidates' sexual behavior. &quot;If it starts becoming an issue, we'll be happy to report it, just as we did with Hart,&quot; says Robert McFarland, Washington bureau chief of NBC. But Helen Donovan, Boston Globe deputy managing editor, finds this approach of waiting for someone else to break the story hypocritical: &quot;It's a puzzler to me that a news organization can strike a high road and say we're not going to chase these rumors, but then if someone else does confirm them, we'll publish them.&quot;    Even worse, some critics say, is to &quot;back in&quot; to the story -- circulating rumors more widely in the guise of refuting or quoting others' reaction to them, as in the Newsweek-Bush and Plain Dealer-Celeste cases -- rather than to confront the issue head-on, as the Miami Herald did. &quot;It's cowardly,&quot; says Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. &quot;It's saying, 'I'm a responsible news organization, so I'm only telling you what irresponsible people are saying.' An organization like Newsweek should be too professional to play that game.&quot;    But pursuing such stories directly presents a host of difficult issues. Editors must question whether they are being manipulated by political foes of the candidate, and whether competitive pressures are forcing a story into print prematurely. The Miami Herald, for instance, has been criticized for a sloppy stakeout and for rushing into print. &quot;If the Herald was really more interested in showing Gary Hart's character and not as eager to get a scoop, it would have taken the time to put the whole incident in context to help the reader more,&quot; Mr. Bagdikian says.    There's also the question of just what constitutes adequate confirmation of such a story. &quot;Unless we perched on the foot of the bed, we have a hell of a time making the leap from calling someone a good friend or confidante to adulterer,&quot; says James Squires, Chicago Tribune editor.    The presidential aspirants are uneasy about questions about their sex lives. When the New York Times asked all the contenders to answer questions on whether adultery should be a campaign issue, most said they regarded those queries as demeaning to the political process.    &quot;When there is too much focus on private life, so that we do not pay attention to the major issues facing a potential president, then we harm our system,&quot; wrote Sen. Paul Simon, one of the Democratic hopefuls, in a newspaper column. Some other aspirants refuse to discuss the subject at all, although one, the Rev. Pat Robertson, calls it a legitimate issue.    Reporters and editors suggest that, in the future, politicians confronted with specific allegations of sexual misconduct are unlikely to repeat Gary Hart's attack on the media. Instead, they will try to avoid repeating Mr. Hart's mistakes in handling the subject, and in some cases may even try to head off any inquiries before they get started.    Rev. Jesse Jackson's wife is taking the latter approach. She has already put the news media on notice that she doesn't want to see any reporting of their private lives. &quot;I don't believe in examining sheets,&quot; she told reporters recently. &quot;If my husband has committed adultery, he better not tell me. And you better not go digging into it, because I'm trying to raise a family and won't let you be the one to destroy my family.&quot;    Benjamin Bradlee, executive editor of the Washington Post, ventures, &quot;Mrs. Jackson made the pre-emptive strike with that.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
