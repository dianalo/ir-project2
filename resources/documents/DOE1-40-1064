Co was separated by extractionof its diethylditiocarbamate complex with CHCl/sub 3/. The results obtainedwere compared with data from INAA (Apostolov and Jordanov, 1976; Rosenberg,1979), and data from atomic absorption spectrometry and X-ray fluorescenceanalysis (Ivanov, 1981). The standard reference material Soil-5 of theIAEA was analysed concurrently. The separation procedure for rare earthsby oxalate precipitation was more time consuming than the extractionone (Ryabchikov and Ryabukhin, 1966), but in the case of standard materialanalysis, which is not serial, it seemed the preferable one to be used.The metod allows for separation of rare earthswith less impurities. Undoubtadvantage was the use of 144-Ce and 57-Co tracers for the control ofchemical yield.</TEXT></DOC>
