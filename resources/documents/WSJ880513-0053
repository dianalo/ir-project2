A newly formed London Bullion Market Association includes 13 market makers and 48 &quot;ordinary members&quot; in a market estimated to trade about 40% of international physical-gold business, bullion dealers said.    &quot;Changes in UK financial regulations encouraged us to accept more participants, but a broader market improves liquidity and should enhance trade,&quot; said Robert Guy, chairman of the new association.    The tigher regulations are partly tied to the turmoil created by the 1984 collapse of Johnson Matthey Bankers Ltd., a major bullion house, which sent ripples through the international gold market.    Mr. Guy, a N.M. Rothschild andamp; Sons director, said his bank and four other London bullion houses -- Mocatta andamp; Goldsmid Ltd., Sharps Pixley Ltd., Samuel Montagu andamp; Co. and Mase Wespac Ltd. -- will continue to carry out the 60-year-old tradition of fixing the price of gold twice a day.    Gold prices fluctuate in a 24-hour trading cycle, but London's twice a day price fixing is the benchmark for producers and purchasers around the world.    Other international precious-metals firms which have passed &quot;stringent tests,&quot; set out by the Bank of England and reputable gold houses also will be market makers. U.S. firms include Chase Manhattan Bank, Deak International Trading Ltd., Drexel Burnham Lambert Trading Ltd., Bank of Boston Corp.'s First National Bank of Boston unit, J.P. Morgan andamp; Co.'s Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. unit, Salomon Inc.'s Philipp Brothers Bullion Ltd. unit, and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.    Credit Suisse will also be among the exclusive group, but other Swiss and U.S. organizations are expected to become market makers.    &quot;Traders from Japan and elsewhere, refiners, the Bank of China and even the Royal Mint, are members of the association,&quot; said Neil Newitt, a committee member and director of J. Aron andamp; Co., a unit of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.    The association has introduced a business code that will be strictly regulated by the Bank of England.    It covers &quot;confidentiality, market ethics, unacceptable inducements to conduct business, ways of avoiding conflicts of interest and a variety of other disciplines,&quot; said Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, at the association's inaugural dinner.    In a warning shot, he said he had &quot;misgivings&quot; about a &quot;recent upsurge in gold loans&quot; that have helped mining companies raise finances on the basis of future gold production.    Whether &quot;cash or bullion is involved&quot; excessive gold lending could be risky and create disorderly markets, Mr. Leigh-Pemberton said. </TEXT></DOC>
