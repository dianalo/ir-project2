Public school officials opened shelters at two schools Thursdaynight to provide needy students with beds, showers and hot meals.   The 12-year old, who was not identified, was the only one ofeight children who stayed at the shelters on the first night who metthe guidelines for the Schoolhouse Shelters program, officials said.A mother brought five children to a shelter, and two teen-agers whosought refuge gave names of schools outside Houston.   ``If only one child shows up, the program's working becausethat's one child that's not on the streets,'' says area schoolsSuperintendent Kaye Stripling.   ``I'm not disappointed,'' Ms. Ellis said. ``It's going to takesome time for the children to build up a trust factor with us, andyou can imagine how frightened these poor little children are withall this attention.''   Four other boys who came to a shelter decided to leave becausethey feared the attention they might draw, said officials who triedunsuccessfully to discourage reporters from staking out the shelter.   Officials in the Houston school district, Texas' largest withabout 190,000 students, set up the shelters after increasing reportsof students living on the streets. Houston has an estimated 20,000to 25,000 homeless people, but it's uncertain how many are children.   The program is based on the premise that students who fearedseeking help elsewhere might turn to a more familiar environment _school.   Under the program's guidelines, only students enrolled in Houstonschools are eligible to stay in the shelters, which are not meantfor families or children who should be served by other socialprograms.   One of the two schools is set up to handle children fromkindergarten through the eighth grade. The other is intended forhigh school students.   The Red Cross donated 75 cots and blankets, and area residentsvolunteered to drive the streets in search of children needingshelter. The cost to Houston schools, which provided food, space andsecurity officers, was described as minimal.   The program will remain in effect at the two schools until atleast Jan. 20, when the superintendent will recommend to the schoolboard that it be continued or modified.   Despite general support from social agencies, some officials havedoubts about how severe the problem is.   Programs already exist for ``truly homeless'' children, said JudyHay of Harris County Children's Protective Services.   But supporters of Schoolhouse Shelters disagreed, saying a coldfront that swept through Houston Thursday evening may help prove thenecessity of the program. Balmy afternoon temperatures dipped to awindy 40 degrees by late evening.   ``These children do not have homes,'' Ms. Ellis said. ``We haveincidences reported where children have left school and gone home tofind that there is nobody there anymore.''</TEXT></DOC>
