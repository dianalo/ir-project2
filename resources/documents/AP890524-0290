But the market finished near its highest levels of the day asthe pound strengthened and traders speculated that Thursday'sBritish trade report wouldn't bring any bearish surprises.   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 18.9points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 2,132.7, slightly below itsbest level of the day.   The index plunged as much as 33.3 points shortly after the Bankof England signaled the rise in interest rates in the morning.British banks raised their base lending rates by 1 percentage pointto 14 percent.   The Financial Times 30-share index fell 13.4 points to 1,774.0,and the Financial Times 500-share index fell 9.68 points to closeat 1,214.97.   Volume fell to 468.3 million shares from Tuesday's 557.5 millionshares.   The rise in British interest rates came after the recent plungein the pound had started to threaten the British government'santi-inflationary strategy. The 100-share index has lost 72 points,or 3.3 perent, since the beginning of the week on worries thatrates were about to go higher.   ``The currency markets have really forced it (the rate rise)upon us,'' one London equities dealer said.   The market found some comfort, however, in news that Britishretail sales volume fell an unexpected 1.4 percent in April,suggesting that previous measures to slow down the economy werealready having the desired effect.</TEXT></DOC>
