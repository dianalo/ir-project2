Throughtelevision, the Thomas hearings became a collective nationalexperience; they also demonstrated what a rich and variedresource American television has become.   Ever since the publication of Ken Auletta's &quot;Three BlindMice,&quot; a number of influential thinkers have been lamentingthe decline of the Big Three networks. Mr. Auletta cites &quot;thelarger public purpose a network can perform when it brings adisparate population together.&quot; The publisher of thisnewspaper, Peter Kann, echoes that view in his review of&quot;Three Blind Mice.&quot; &quot;The old network fare may have beencommon culture,&quot; he writes, &quot;but at least we had it incommon.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   These people would argue against control of the press. Andthey would never argue that we all ought to be reading thesame three newspapers. What is so different about televisionthat makes thoughtful people sentimental about a time whenour viewing choices were limited?   I hope the televised Thomas hearings quell their concerns.Even in an environment of 30, 50, or 100 channels oftelevision, our disparate society can experience eventscollectively when it wants to.   Our common television culture really rose out oftelevision tyranny. Americans' viewing choices were limitedby a government system that unnecessarily restrictedbroadcast licenses and put this vast resource in the hands ofjust a few companies. In fact, the government was so nervousabout the power allocated to so few, it mandated thatbroadcasters serve &quot;the public interest, convenience, andnecessity.&quot;   Thus our network, C-SPAN, was an innovation. In 1979,cable operators decided to pool revenues -- currently aboutthree cents a month for every home that signs up for thebasic cable-TV package -- to create a channel devoted topublic-affairs programming. Private business had created apublic service entirely without government mandate.   Naysayers thought C-SPAN was not destined to last. Ourprogramming was &quot;too boring&quot; to hold viewers, they said. Ourlow-key coverage of Capitol Hill -- without jazzy music andspinning graphics -- went against conventional televisionwisdom. How would the viewing public react to a channel whereno anchors interpreted the events being televised?   Instead of dying on the vine, C-SPAN now finds itself withlots of competition in long-form hearing coverage. On Friday,I went through the 60 channels on my cable system and foundgavel-to-gavel coverage on nine stations -- each offering adifferent perspective. Even before Clarence Thomas's hearingsmade it to the broadcast networks on Friday, four otherchannels were televising them in their entirety -- C-SPAN,CNN, Court TV and PBS.   Network public-affairs programming is still highlyinfluential. The networks' Sunday shows remain must viewingfor news and information junkies. What's changed is thatviewers no longer have to accommodate themselves to networkprogram schedules. Public-affairs programming is availablearound the clock on two C-SPAN channels. And a variety ofpublic-affairs programming is widely available on CNN, CNBC,Discovery, Aandamp;E, the Weather Channel, and of course PBS.   Even if they generally like having more TV options on adaily basis, some people imbued with television nostalgiaworry that all this choice won't allow society to shareevents of magnitude -- the Kennedy assassination, the spaceprogram, or the Vietnam War. But recent experiences disprovethese concerns, as well. At the outset of the Persian GulfWar, 78% of all the homes watching television tuned in toPresident Bush's Jan. 16 press conference, nearly matchingthe 81% of TV homes watching the Kennedy funeral in 1963.That night the war started, the nation chose to have acollective experience -- even though 60% of the country haddozens of other viewing options available to them throughtheir cable-TV subscriptions. And now we see that the Thomashearings have turned out to be a collective experience, aswell.   Cable has offered viewers important -- and new -- chancesto be a part of the events they watch. Since 1980, C-SPAN hasmade viewer call-ins a regular part of its public-affairsprogramming. Each year, more than 13,000 callers can soundoff or ask questions about the events they're watching. Thisblending of television and telephone means that TV no longertalks at the viewer -- it talks with the audience at home.   Many people voice the concern that the wide availabilityof public-affairs programming on cable television will causethe broadcast networks to back away from their public-serviceresponsibilities. This is just another example of television&quot;old think.&quot; If the networks are no longer sole pipelinesinto American households, why should we require them to offerpublic-affairs coverage? Instead, let the free marketdetermine their offerings.   For example, there is already much debate about whetherthe networks will televise next summer's politicalconventions. Yet public broadcasting -- in cooperation withNBC -- has already announced full coverage. And 60% of thenation can watch the conventions in full on CNN and CSPAN.Why worry whether network cameras will be there?   It's time for us gray-hairs to look at television withfresh eyes and abandon our nostalgia. Diversity of choice isfundamentally American. Rather than looking tearily backward,we should learn to use the wide variety of information we nowhave.   ---   Mr. Lamb is C-SPAN's chairman and moderator.</TEXT></DOC>
