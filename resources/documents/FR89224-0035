Dane, Chief, Officeof Scientific Authority, at the above address (703-358-1708 or FTS 358-1708).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The genus <T3>Pan </T3>contains two species: the chimpanzee (<T3>P. troglodytes</T3>) and the pygmy chimpanzee (<T3>P. paniscus</T3>). There actually is little over-all difference insize between the two species, both weighing up to about 100 pounds (45kilograms) in the wild. However, <T3>P. paniscus </T3>has relatively larger lower limbs and a narrower chestthan does <T3>P. troglodytes. </T3>The chimpanzee is known to have occurred originallyin 25 countries of equatorial Africa, from Senegal in the west to Tanzaniain the east. The pygmy chimpanzee is found only in the nation of Zaire,and only to the south of the Zaire River. The ranges of the two speciesare not known to overlap. In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of October 19, 1976 (41 FR 45993), the Serviceclassified both the chimpanzee and pygmy chimpanzee as threatened species,pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act) (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>). Cited problems included human destruction of naturalhabitat, capture and export for research laboratories and zoos, the spreadof disease from people to chimpanzees, and ineffectiveness of existingregulatory mechanisms. Simultaneously, the Service issued a special regulationproviding that the prohibitions, which generally cover all threatened species,would not apply to live <T3>P. troglodytes </T3>and <T3>P. paniscus </T3>held in captivity in the United States on the effectivedate of the rule, or to the progeny of such animals, or to the progenyof chimpanzees legally imported into the United States after the effectivedate of the rule. This exemption was intended to facilitate legitimateactivities of American research institutions, zoos, and entertainment operations,without affecting wild chimpanzee populations.Within the last decade there have been increasing indications that thestatus of wild chimpanzees is deteriorating and that most populations arecontinuing to decline. On November 4, 1987, the Service received a petitionfrom the Humane Society of the United States, World Wildlife Fund, andJane Goodall Institute, requesting that <T3>P. troglodytes </T3>be legally reclassified from threatened to endangered.The petition was accompanied by a detailed report from the Committee forConservation and Care of Chimpanzees (Teleki 1987). This report cites practicallyall pertinent recent literature on the status of the chimpanzee in thewild, and was prepared with the assistance of numerous field research workers.It points out that the chimpanzee has declined drastically because of suchproblems as massive habitat destruction, population fragmentation, excessivelocal hunting, and international trade. On February 4, 1988, the Servicemade a finding, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Act, thatthe petition had presented substantial information indicating that therequested reclassification may be warranted. In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of March 23, 1988 (56 FR 9460), the Service publishedthis finding and announced a status review of both <T3>P. troglodytes </T3>and <T3>P. paniscus. </T3>The comment period for the review ended on July 21,1988.During the review period, the Service received 40 comments from major authoritiesand organizations, and from governments of nations with wild chimpanzeepopulations, all of which agreed with the petition and/or provided additionalinformation lending support. Of these, 17 were from parties who actuallyhave studied chimpanzees in the wild. In addition, during the review period,54,212 supporting letters and postcards were received from the public.Since the end of the review period, several thousand more supporting commentshave arrived.The Service received six comments opposing reclassification during thereview period, and several more afterward. None of these comments providedinformation about the status of chimpanzees in the wild, but they did makethree general points: (1) The petition and accompanying report do not presenta complete or accurate picture, and contain errors; (2) any plans for reclassificationshould await the results of a prospective National Institutes of HealthSurvey of chimpanzees and other primates in Africa; and (3) chimpanzeesare important in biomedical research, no animals have been imported tothe United States for such purposes in the last decade, and reclassificationto endangered would interfere with study, transportation, and propagationof animals already here.With respect to the first point, the Service is satisfied that the reportby the Committee for Conservation and Care of Chimpanzees is reliable andcontains much valuable information derived in large part from parties whohave observed first hand the situation in the wild. Its over-all assessmentcorresponds closely with that found in a new International Union for Conservationof Nature (IUCN) Red Data Book, <T3>Threatened Primates of Africa </T3>(Lee, Thornback, and Bennett 1988),which became available to the Service following the review period. Theindicated errors seem to be mostly minor typographical ones. The reportacknowledges that data are limited for some areas and that additional surveywork is urgently needed. However, and with respect to the second pointabove, major new field surveys would take years to complete, and the Actrequires that classification be based on the best data available and thatdecisions on petitions be made within 12 months of receipt. The report,the IUCN Red Data Book, and other currently available information providea sufficiently comprehensive picture of the chimpanzee's status to allowassignment of legal classification.With respect to the third point, the chimpanzee (<T3>P. troglodytes</T3>) is considered to be of much importance in biomedicaland other kinds of research, and is also held in captivity for use by zoos,as pets, and in entertainment. The petition and supporting documents andcomments dealt primarily with status in the wild, and not with the viabilityof captive populations. To the extent that self-sustaining breeding groupsof captive <T3>P. troglodytes </T3>provide surplus animals for research and otherpurposes, there is a reduced probability that other individuals of thatspecies will be removed from the wild. There has been no major legal importationof wild chimpanzees into the United States for about a decade, and recentlypassed legislation would prohibit investigators supported by Federal fundsfrom using chimpanzees taken from the wild. At present, research work continuesin the United States through the use of captive breeding groups. Withoutthe availability of such groups, the relevant research probably would bedone by others, perhaps in foreign countries and with wild-caught animalsand their progeny. This line of reasoning suggests that severe restrictionson the use of captive animals in the United States could both discouragepropagation efforts and lead to a decline in the population here, and possiblycontribute to a greater demand for wild-caught animals elsewhere.The management of some captive breeding groups reportedly continues tobecome more sophisticated and successful. A studbook for <T3>P. troglodytes </T3>has been developed, and proposals to establisha Species Survival Plan are being prepared by members of the American Associationof Zoological Parks and Aquariums. These plans are designed to maintainthe genetic diversity of the captive population. Approximately 240 <T3>P. troglodytes </T3>are held by the Association's member institutions.The extent of breeding among <T3>P. troglodytes </T3>held as private pets or for entertainment purposesis not known, and neither is the number of individuals involved, but therehas been one estimate of 200.From 1,100 to 1,450 <T3>P. troglodytes </T3>are held by biomedical facilities in the UnitedStates. Many of these animals have been used in various studies of infectiousdiseases and are not suitable for breeding programs. Furthermore, eightinstitutions hold most of these animals, and all but one currently providerecords to the International Species Inventory System. Five of the eightare part of the National Chimpanzee Breeding Program coordinated and supportedby the National Institutes of Health. This program now has about 400 animals.Its immediate goal is to augment the breeding population with half of theoffspring (about 35 animals/year). In addition, the National Institutesof Health has funded research directed at increasing the breeding capabilityof the captive population. Finally, there have been promising findingsthat may enhance this population and reduce the need for additional animals,especially through development of a means to distinguish chimpanzees exposedto, but not infected with, non-A/non-B hepatitis virus.There are also over 1,000 captive <T3>P. troglodytes </T3>in Europe, including about 300 in biomedical researchfacilities and 550 in zoos. Many of these animals are in groups that arebeing managed with the objective of achieving self-sustaining breedingpopulations. In addition, there are approximately 300 captive members ofthis species in Japan, including over 100 in research facilities, and about60 more in zoos in Australia and New Zealand.Considering the above management situation, the Service is not proposingreclassification of captive <T3>P. troglodytes,</T3> and those populations in the United States wouldstill be covered by the present special regulation. The Service would monitorcaptive status by requesting an annual report from each major facilityin the United States holding chimpanzees, relative to numbers, mortality,breeding success, and other pertinent factors. This proposal is restrictedto reclassification of the species in the wild, which evidently was theprimary objective of the petition. Section 4(b)(3) of the Act requiresthat, within 12 months of receipt of such a petition, a finding be madeas to whether the requested action is warranted, not warranted, or warrantedbut precluded by other listing activity. In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of December 28, 1988 (53 FR 52452), the Serviceannounced its finding that reclassification of wild populations of thechimpanzee from threatened to endangered is warranted. The Service nowalso announces that its status review indicates that the pygmy chimpanzeeshould be reclassified from threatened to endangered. The latter speciesis represented by fewer than 100 captive individuals throughout the world.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species </ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding speciesto the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered orthreatened species due to one or more of the five factors described insection 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the chimpanzee(<T3>Pan troglodytes</T3>) and pygmy chimpanzee (<T3>Pan paniscus</T3>) are as follows (information from Lee, Thornback,and Bennett 198, and Teleki 1987, unless otherwise indicated). A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range.</T3> The historical range of <T3>P. troglodytes</T3> encompassed all or parts of at least 25 countries,from Senegal to Tanzania. This distribution corresponded closely with thetropical forest belt of equatorial Africa, and indeed the chimpanzee isusually dependent on areas of unbroken forest, though there is increasingevidence that it is not uniformly distributed throughout such areas. Thespecies also is able to survive at lower density in secondary forests,savannahs, and other habitats, if food sources, particularly fruit trees,remain available, and human disturbance is not extensive. <T3>P. paniscus</T3> is found only in the forests of central Zaire, betweenthe Zaire, Lomami, and Kasai/Sankuru Rivers, but its distribution is notcontinuous in this area. Habitat destruction, with consequent access and disturbance by people,is one of the major factors in the decline of the chimpanzees. Human populationincrease, conversion of forests to agriculture, and commercial logginghave drastically reduced available chimpanzee habitat. These processesare most prevalent in the western and eastern parts of the over-all rangeof <T3>P. troglodytes</T3>, and seem to be working towards the center. Mostof the primary forests of such countries as Sierra Leone, Rwanda, and Burundihave already been eliminated, along with most of the resident chimpanzeepopulations. The IUCN already classifies one of the three subspecies of <T3>P. troglodytes</T3> as endangered. This subspecies, <T3>P. t. verus</T3>, formerly ranged from Senegal to Nigeria, and mayhave numbered 500,000 individuals. There are now probably fewer than 17,000,mostly in small, discontinuous populations. Much of the decline has takenplace only in the last few decades. In Sierra Leone, for example, numberscrashed from about 20,000 in the 1960's to around 2,000 today. The othertwo subspecies of <T3>P. troglodytes, P. t. troglodytes</T3> in the central part of the rangeof the species, and <T3>P. t. schweinfurthi</T3> in the east, are together estimated to numberbetween about 85,000 and 215,000 individuals. The latter figure is highlyspeculative and based on the probably incorrect assumption that many uninvestigatedareas still contain suitable habitat and are occupied at potential carryingcapacity (see discussion of Zaire, below). Both the central and eastern subspecies of <T3>P. troglodytes</T3>, as well as the species <T3>P. paniscus</T3>, are classified as vulnerable, rather than endangered,by the IUCN. It must be noted, however, that the IUCN designations of endangeredand vulnerable are not the precise equivalents of the terms endangeredand threatened as defined in the Act. The latter term is often appliedby the Service to entities in which deterioration is only potential oreven in which such deterioration has been arrested. The term endangeredrefers to any species that is in danger of extinction throughout all ora significant portion of its range. With respect to the chimpanzees, inwhich major declines are ongoing and likely to accelerate, endangered isthe more appropriate classification. Moreover, the IUCN designations wereapplied to the chimpanzee prior to availability of new information indicatingthat serious problems have developed in what was thought to be the safestpart of the range of the species (see below). The chimpanzee now has been entirely extirpated from 5 of the 25 countriesin which it is known to have originally occurred. Its numbers have beenreduced to fewer than 1,000 individuals in 10 other countries, to fewerthan 5,000 in 6 others, and to fewer than 10,000 in 2 of the remaining4 countries. There had been an assumption that the chimpanzee was relativelysecure in the nation of Gabon, based on a survey in the early 1980's, whichestimated numbers there at about 64,000. However, Dr. Caroline E.G. Tutin,who headed that survey, recently submitted a comment during the Service'sstatus review, in which she stated that, because of habitat disruptionand hunting, the chimpanzee had begun ``to decline at an alarming rate''in Gabon. She thinks that numbers will fall by at least 20 percent by 1996,and she now favors reclassification to endangered. The status of <T3>P. troglodytes</T3> is most poorly known in the nation of Zaire. Numericalestimates range up to 110,000 individuals, but such figures are based oncalculations of the amount of habitat thought to be suitable, and on theassumption that all such habitat is still occupied. There are indicationsthat much of the involved area may never have supported substantial chimpanzeepopulations, even under natural conditions, and that the species alreadyhas been eliminated in other parts of the area, particularly through loggingand hunting. A more realistic estimate for the number of <T3>P. troglodytes</T3> in Zaire would be around 20,000. In other countriesin the eastern part of the range of the species, populations are knownto have become highly fragmented and to be declining. Numerical estimates for <T3>P. paniscus</T3>, which occurs only in Zaire, also sometimes have beenhigh, up to about 100,000-200,000. Again, however, such figures are basedon the belief that distribution is continuous. Actually, according to theIUCN, the species is absent or rare in many areas of presumed suitablehabitat, even under natural conditions, and is apparently not present inthe central part of its range. It now remains common only in a few scatteredlocalities, with the most reliable population estimate being about 15,000animals. The main ongoing problem is habitat loss through increasing slashand burn cultivation, and commercial logging. Reduction and fragmentationof the already discontinuous range also has resulted from local hunting.These problems are relatively well known with respect to <T3>P. paniscus</T3> south of the Zaire River, and provide an idea of whatmay also be happening to <T3>P. troglodytes</T3>, found to the north. <T3>P. paniscus</T3> evidently is the rarer of the two species. B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes.</T3> Chimpanzees are extensively sought by people, both alivefor use in research, entertainment, and exhibitions, and dead, for localuse as food and in religious rituals. Such utilization is contributingsubstantially to the decline of each species. The United States was oncethe chief importer of chimpanzees (41 FR 45993; October 19, 1976), buthas experienced no major legal activity of this kind for about a decade.Commercial trade has continued elsewhere, and there has been an alarmingrecent trend towards killing adult females both for local use as meat andin order to secure their live offspring for export. Also, because entirefamily groups may have to be eliminated in order to secure one live infant,and since many of these infants perish during the process, it has beenestimated that five to ten chimpanzees die for every one that is deliveredalive to an overseas buyer. Many thousands of wild chimpanzees have beenlost in this manner during the last several decades, with a resulting exterminationor great reduction of several major populations, particularly in westernAfrica. There remains a substantial commercial demand for chimpanzees,especially for biomedical research, and to a lesser extent for behavioralstudies. There also is an escalating demand for local utilization of the meat ofchimpanzees. Opening of forest habitat and the spread of modern weaponsare helping to satisfy this demand. Mining operations attract large concentrationsof people and result in intensive hunting to supply meat from the surroundingforests. Such activity is of particular concern with respect to <T3>P. troglodytes</T3> in eastern Zaire. Comments from several authorities(Dr. Arthur D. Horn, Dr. Geza Teleki, and Drs. Nancy Thompson-Handler andRichard K. Malenky), received by the Service during its recent status review,also indicate that <T3>P. paniscus</T3> has declined in numbers and distribution through localtaking for use as food or pets, and in religious rituals. C. <T3>Disease or Predation.</T3> Chimpanzees are susceptible to many of thesame diseases that afflict people (indeed this is why chimpanzees are consideredvital in biomedical research. When natural chimpanzee populations are reducedand come into increasing contact with the expanding human population, theformer may be exposed to infectious diseases. In a comment in responseto the Service's status review, Dr. Jane Goodall pointed out that illnessesof various types, including several major epidemics, have been among thefactors preventing an increase in the chimpanzee population of Tanzania'sGombe National Park, even though that area is better protected than aremost chimpanzee habitats of Africa. D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.</T3> Both <T3>P. troglodytes</T3> and <T3>P. paniscus</T3> are on Appendix I of the Convention on InternationalTrade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Convention), meaningessentially that export and import are prohibited by member nations, unlesssuch activity is not detrimental to the species. In addition, domesticlegislation in various non-African countries, including the United States,restricts or forbids importation of chimpanzees. Many of the African nationswith wild chimpanzee populations also have protective laws. Nonetheless,chimpanzees continue to be exported, imported, and captured and killedillegally for various uses. Internationally, there have been problems, both because not all involvedcountries are parties to the Convention, and because the controls of theConvention are sometimes surreptitiously bypassed. There have been casesof chimpanzees being illegally captured in and exported from countriesin Africa, and then brought into nations that are parties to the Convention.In response to inquiries by the Service during its recent status review,the governments of several African nations indicated that they have regulationsprotecting chimpanzees, but that enforcement is very weak because of lackof resources and expertise. The Central African Republic, for example,explained that hunting pressure by the native forest people was relativelylight, but that poachers from surrounding areas, and even from outsidethe country, were causing increasing problems. In her response to the review,Dr. Jane Goodall stated that poaching even had become a problem in thewell-protected Gombe National Park of Tanzania. E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>Dr. Goodall's response also pointed out that the naturally slow reproductiverate of chimpanzees (very few adult females raise more than two young tomaturity during their approximately 27 years of reproductive life), combinedwith increasing human pressures, places the chimpanzee in a precarioussurvival position. It is her opinion that ``the continued removal of infantsfrom wild populations (even if this does <T3>not</T3> involve the killing of breeding females) will, within a relativelyshort period of time, bring wild chimpanzees to the verge of extinctionin Africa.'' In a separate response to an inquiry from the United StatesEmbassy in Tanzania, made at a request from the Service during its recentreview, Dr. Goodall added that the chimpanzee population of Gombe NationalPark had become isolated by surrounding human agricultural activity, andthere were thus doubts about the long-term genetic viability of the population.The problems indicated by Dr. Goodall are unfortunately becoming prevalentthroughout the range of the chimpanzee. All populations are undergoingfragmentation into ever smaller and more isolated units. This process ismost advanced in the western and eastern populations, but is underway evenin Zaire. It restricts natural interbreeding and increases vulnerabilityto decimation by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Small, isolatedgroups of chimpanzees are more easily eliminated by human hunting, disease,or any local environmental disruption. Fragmentation and associated disturbancemay also have adverse long-term effects relating to social structure andreproduction. The decision to propose reclassification to endangered status for the chimpanzeein the wild, and for the pygmy chimpanzee in the wild and in captivity,was based on an assessment of the best available scientific information,and of past, present, and probably future threats to the two species. Wildpopulations of the chimpanzee have been reduced to a small fraction oftheir original size, and the species has disappeared entirely from a numberof countries. Its status continues to deteriorate through habitat destruction,expansion of human activity, hunting, commercial exploitation, and otherproblems. Such deterioration is likely to continue or accelerate with respectto wild populations, though in the United States and certain other countriesthere are captive groups sufficiently large to be maintained independently;current efforts to enhance the care and breeding potential of these groupscould reduce the demand for additional wild individuals. The pygmy chimpanzee,which evidently is rarer and more restricted in range than is the otherspecies, has suffered from similar problems in the wild and is representedby only a few captive individuals. To retain a classification of threatenedfor the pygmy chimpanzee, and for the chimpanzee in the wild, would notadequately reflect the decline of these species and the multiplicity oflong-term problems confronting them. Critical habitat is not being proposed,as its designation is not applicable outside of the United States. <ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages conservation measures by Federal,international, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, and as implemented by regulationsat 50 CFR Part 402, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actionsthat are to be conducted within the United States or on the high seas,with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered orthreatened and with respect to its proposed or designated critical habitat(if any). Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activitiesthey authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continuedexistence of a listed species or to destroy or adversely modify its criticalhabitat. If a proposed Federal action may affect a listed species, theresponsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with theService. Since the chimpanzee and pygmy chimpanzee are now listed as threatened,they are already fully covered by section 7(a), and their reclassificationto endangered would add no new requirements in this regard. Section 9 of the Act, and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21,set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply toall endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal forany person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take, importor export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of a commercial activity,or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce, any listedspecies. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport,or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptionsapply to agents of the Service. With respect to the case at hand, theseprohibitions would not apply to live members of the species <T3>Pan troglodytes</T3> held in captivity in the United States on theeffective date of the final rule, or to the progeny of such animals, orto the progeny of animals legally imported into the United States afterthe effective date of the final rule. Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingendangered wildlife species, including individuals and parts and productsthereof, under certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits arecodified at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available for scientificpurposes, to enhance propagation or survival, or for incidental take inconnection with otherwise lawful activities. All such permits must alsobe consistent with the purposes and policy of the Act, as required by section10(d) of the Act. Reclassification to endangered status would precludeissuance of permits to import wild-caught individuals solely for zoologicalexhibition or educational purposes, as is not allowed for threatened speciespursuant to 50 CFR 17.32. In some instances, permits may be issued duringa specified period of time to relieve undue economic hardship that wouldbe suffered if such relief were not available.<ITAG tagnum="84">Revision of Special Rules</ITAG>This proposal would continue the current special regulation, describedabove under ``Background,'' with respect to captive individuals of thespecies <T3>P. troglodytes</T3> in the United States, but there also would be anadditional provision. Since all members of that species in captivity wouldbe classified as threatened, there could be potential for individuals tobe taken from the wild and then for such individuals or their progeny tobe imported into the United States pursuant to regulations covering threatenedspecies, which are less restrictive than those covering endangered species.To assure that removal of animals from the wild is not encouraged by lessrestrictive regulations, which might result in a drain on wild populations,the special rules would provide that the regulations covering endangeredspecies, which are discussed above under ``Available Conservation Measures,''would apply to any individual chimpanzee within the historic range of thespecies, regardless of whether in the wild or in captivity. This provisionalso would apply to any chimpanzee not within the historic range, but whichoriginated within this range after the effective date of the new rule,and also would apply to the progeny of any such chimpanzee, other thanto the progeny of animals legally imported into the United States afterthe effective date. This last exception is made so that a chimpanzee, bornto parents already legally imported into the United States under the restrictiveendangered species regulations, would not have to be tracked and treatedseparately from the rest of the captive population.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited</ITAG>The Service intends that any final rule adopted will be accurate and aseffective as possible in the conservation of endangered or threatened species.Therefore, comments and suggestions concerning any aspect of this proposedrule are hereby solicited from the public, concerned governmental agencies,and other parties. Comments are particularly sought concerning the following:(1) Biological, commercial, or other relevant data concerning any threat(or lack thereof) to the subject species;(2) Additional information concerning the distribution and captive statusof these species; and(3) Current or planned activities in the involved areas, and their possibleeffect on the subject species.Final promulgation of the regulation on the subject species will take intoconsideration the comments and any additional information received by theService, and such communications may lead to adoption of a final regulationthat differs from this proposal.The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date of theproposal, should be in writing, and should be directed to the party namedin the above <T2>``ADDRESSES'' </T2>section.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as definedunder the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, neednot be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section4(a) of the Endangered Species Act, as amended.
