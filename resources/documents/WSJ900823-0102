Newt Gingrich, the second-ranking HouseRepublican, further complicated deficit-reduction talks bycalling for tax cuts rather than tax increases.   The Georgian, who is a budget summit negotiator, saidyesterday that he is putting together a package of tax cutsthat will include a reduction in the rate on capital gainsand, perhaps, a cut in the Social Security payroll tax. Theaim is to stimulate the economy at a time when it appears onthe verge of recession, he said.</LP><TEXT>   Previously, Rep. Gingrich had expressed more willingnessto increase taxes to help reduce the budget deficit. Aspokesman said, &quot;He is still in favor of the summit processand reaching the targets.&quot;   Still, his latest statement is yet another reminder thatMr. Gingrich and the House Republicans he represents arestalwarts against a tax increase. That position is yetanother obstacle to reaching a fiscal 1991 budget accord,which would include tax increases and spending restraints.</TEXT></DOC>
