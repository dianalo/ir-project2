The draft calls for a continuation of interagency coordinationunder the auspices of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, andurges that the President make the work of that Office's Biotechnology ScienceCoordinating Committee a high priority. Other suggestions include a survey of biotechnology developments and agencyregulation under existing statutes to determine whether current law andregulation provide adequate authority to protect public and private interests.The survey would be conducted by the Office of Science and Technology Policyand the Office of Technology Assessment.
