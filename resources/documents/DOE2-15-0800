These fuels have properties that enhance theinherent safety of the system, such as high thermal conductivity, compatibilitywith liquid sodium, and low fuel/cladding mechanical interaction. Whilemetal-fuel irradiation behavior is well understood, there are some areaswhere more information is needed to fully understand the various safety-relatedphenomena, such as fuel/cladding chemical interaction, eutectic meltingand penetration, and axial relocation of molten fuel prior to claddingbreach. Because many of these phenomena can cause changes in the reactivitystate of the system, their effects on whole-core normal, anticipated,and hypothetical accident scenarios need to be studied. The metal-fuelbehavior model DEFORM-5 is being developed to provide the necessary phenomenologicalbasis for these studies. The first stage in the DEFORM-5 developmenthas been completed. Presently, DEFORM-5 calculates the cladding strain,life fraction, and eutectic penetration thinning for Types D9, HT9, or316 steels. This first stage of DEFORM-5 has been used to analyze theTREAT M2, M3, and M4 transients with irradiated Experimental BreederReactor-II driver fuel. The paper shows the DEFORM-5 and experimentalresults for failure times for the test pins. The results provide confidenceand validation of the DEFORM-5 modeling of the cladding behavior.</TEXT></DOC>
