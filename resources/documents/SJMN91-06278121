They have law degrees, law clerks to help research knottyquestions, and easy access to books on the previous rulings their courts haveissued.;   But Chief Justice Tom Tso of the Navajo Nation Supreme Court inWindow Rock, Ariz., works every day in a wooden trailer. He has no law degree,although he is well-versed in Navajo Indian laws. He shares a law clerk, knownas a solicitor, with two other justices.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  INDIAN COURTS HANDICAPPED BY LACK OF FUNDSDEFENDANTS' RIGHTS SAID TO BE AT RISK  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     And legal research on precedents is difficult because, owing to a lack offunds, the book reporting the past three years of judgments in the Indiantribal court system never went to press.;   The disparities between mostcourts in the country and Indian tribal courts have long been conceded, butthere is increasing concern among American Indians, civil rights officials andsome members of Congress that these disparities, caused in large part byinadequate financial support, are depriving litigants in the tribal system oftheir civil rights.;   &quot;If you cut the funding to other courts in the UnitedStates by 50 percent -- and I think that would be equivalent to the situationwe're in -- would they be able to provide the full array of civil rights?&quot; Tsoasked. &quot;Lack of funding causes all kinds of problems in terms of having accessto legal resources, getting training, paying court personnel, paying jurors.But we do the best we can.&quot;;   In the 147 Indian tribal courts that exercisejurisdiction over nearly 2 million Indians in the United States, some judgestell of having worked without pay. And because most tribal judicial systemshave no money for public defenders, many indigent defendants have no legalrepresentation.;   In Edmonds, Wash., Chief Judge Elbridge Coochise of theNorthwest Intertribal Court System said the prosecution was handled by a layperson in about 20 percent of the cases, and defendants in criminal casesappeared in court without a lawyer in 60 to 70 percent of the cases.;   When adefendant has no lawyer, the chief judge said, judges must be especiallycareful to see that the defendant's rights are not being overlooked, andsometimes even the prosecutor will watch out for the defendant.;   &quot;Theprosecutor will take on a kind of defense role just so he won't feel he'sramrodding his case on the defendant,&quot; he continued. &quot;Sometimes he will tellthe defendant you can ask for this or that type of motion. Some defendantsfeel shortchanged, because they know that in state court they can get legalservices if they're indigent. I think defendants need to have representation,but it goes back to the lack of resources.&quot;;   Congress is now moving toupgrade the tribal court system. Legislation drafted recently by the SenateSelect Committee on Indian Affairs would restructure the tribal courts andincrease their funds almost fivefold, bringing them in line with those ofcomparable state courts.;   The legislation would provide $50 million totribal courts beginning in 1993 and would grant an additional $7.5 million ayear from 1993 to 1997 to support the new entities and to purchase computers.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911004  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  15A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  526  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, October 4, 199100278121,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
