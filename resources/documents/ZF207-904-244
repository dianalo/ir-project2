 Amid a vastsea of Big Blue machines, Apple's island of Macintoshes was located on themain floor of the Las Vegas Convention Center.andP;  For the past three years, thecompany had exhibited in a room off the main floor.andM;&quot;We can't be segregated in a boutique.andP;  That was the lesson of the MacDEXfiasco,&quot; said Erna Arnesen, Apple director of value-added sales, referring tothe all-Mac spinoff exhibition that flopped in its first run last spring.andM;The Apple booth was designed to deliver a general message about theadvantages of the Mac, Arnesen said.andP;  In past years, Apple has focused almostexclusively on recruiting value-added dealers.andM;&quot;Research showed Comdex attendees want to see our hardware and connectivitysolutions, not just learn about dealer and VAR programs,&quot; Arnesen said.andM;The booth featured the family of Mac systems, multimedia and connectivityproducts.andP;  It also displayed a range of VAR solutions.andP;  GE Government Systemsof Melbourne, Fla., demonstrated its Mac IIx-based system for displayingradar telemetry data from a tethered blimp used by the government for druginterdiction.andM;&quot;This is the most advanced engineering application for Mac,&quot; said EricNewman, the GE engineer who developed the system.andM;Apple also announced a half-dozen new VAR contracts with Agfa Compugraphic,Gould Electronics, Planning Research Corp., Tektronix, Tri-Star Market Dataand Voluntary Hospitals of America.andM;Some exhibitors and attendees noted that the complexion of the fall Comdex ischanging.andM;&quot;The show is increasingly shifting from a dealer show to one for major buyerswho come to see the latest developments in hardware and software,&quot; said PaulBrainerd, president of Aldus Corp. in Seattle, Wash.andM;&quot;I am here so the PC guys from my company wouldn't be able to snow me whenthey got back,&quot; said Ric Henry, project manager for Federal Express' centralsupport services in Memphis, Tenn.andP;  &quot;We are trying to integrate our Mac andPC networks.andP;  I am disappointed that there is not more Mac stuff here fromthird parties.andP;  We aren't the only ones who need to integrate.&quot;andM;Although the show was overwhelmingly PC-oriented, some news developments hadan effect on Apple.andM;IBM's major emphasis at Comdex was on multimedia, an area on which Apple hasbeen focusing for the past year as a key strategic direction and point ofdifferentiation.andM;IBM Executive Vice President George Conrades gave a John Sculley-like keynoteaddress featuring his own jazz drumming and Apple-style rhetoric about&quot;empowering our customers.&quot; The IBM booth prominently featured the company'smultimedia offerings.andM;PC third parties offered a broad range of multimedia products.andP;  VideoLogic ofCambridge, Mass., announced a board for PCs, PS/2s and EISA computers thatallows full-motion video in multiple resizable windows.andP;  The company said itwould announce a Macintosh version at Macworld in April.andM;HeadStart Computers, a division of North American Philips, announced aPC-compatible with built-in CD-ROM drive and more than 1 Gbyte of softwarefor less than $2,000.andM;&quot;IBM is hungry, and it is confident of its multimedia strategy,&quot; said PeterBlack, president of Xiphias, a previously all-Mac developer who announcedsupport for HeadStart.andM;&quot;Products like this are going to put incredible price pressure on Apple,&quot;said Nick Arnett, president of Multimedia Computing Corp.andM;IBM and Microsoft made news at the show by attempting to clarify theirstrategies for operating systems and graphical user interfaces.andP;  The twocompanies put to rest speculation that a downsized version of PresentationManager would be developed to run on top of MS-DOS.andP;  The statement ofdirection emphasized that OS/2 would remain the strategic future platform,but IBM for the first time recommended Microsoft Windows as the environmentfor PCs with 2 Mbytes or less of RAM.andM;&quot;This was meant to clarify the situation, but users are going to remainconfused, and that can only be to Apple's advantage,&quot; said one prominentventure  capitalist.andM;Overall, vendors who shelled out from one to several hundred thousand dollarsto exhibit one of the 1,729 booths at the 10 sites were pleased with theevent.andM;&quot;Comdex provides largely intangible benefits,&quot; said Dan Crane, president ofTraveling Software of Bothell, Wash.andP;  &quot;You can collect sales leads and meetwith VARs, but the key factor is market visibility.andP;  It's a competitiveadvantage to have a presence [at Comdex].&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
