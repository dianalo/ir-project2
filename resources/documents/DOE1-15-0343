Use of magnetic flux dysprosium concentratespermits to increase magnetic field induction upto 20 Tl. SMS is composedof three concentric superconducting solenoids arranged in submerged typehelium cryostate. External and medium solenoids are made of NbTi baseindustrial round multiwire conductor and may operate as separate magnets.Internal solenoid is made of Nb/sub 3/Sn base tape conductor, and isaimed at operating in external stabilizing magnetic field. SMS displayedstabilized operation under all conditions and conserved its parametersafter a few tens of transitions to the normal state.</TEXT></DOC>
