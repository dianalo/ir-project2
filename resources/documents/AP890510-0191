The command raised its so-called Personnel Movement Limitationalert from a ``Bravo'' level to a ``Charlie,'' meaning servicemenand their families were told to ``limit all movement.''   A PML-Charlie, in military parlance, means that ``major civildisturbances are occurring (and personnel) should not go intopublic areas in Panama except for essential business.''   ``Limit your travel to work, non-affected areas or anotherdefense site ... and monitor Southern Command broadcasts closely toavoid trouble areas,'' the alert adds.   The previous alert, a PML-Bravo, was issued shortly before lastweekend's national elections and simply advised servicemen to``decrease visibility'' because ``some civil disturbance activityis probable.''   The Pentagon said it had been advised the Southern Commandtightened the alert at 4:45 p.m. EDT Wednesday.   No other special precautions or troop movements have beenordered, the Pentagon added.   The change in alert status came amid reports that Panamanianopposition candidate Guillermo Endara had been injured Wednesdayafternoon when police using tear gas and gunfire broke up a protestof the government's vote count in the presidential election.   Endara and his two vice presidential candidates were leading anauto caravan in Panama City when riot police began using tear gasand birdshot to disperse the demonstrators.   The violence began when the caravan encountered a policeblockade as it approached the downtown area. Opposition spokesmensaid several people were arrested, including Endara's presssecretary, Luis Martins.   Endara was taken to a hospital, his head bleeding and his shirtcovered with blood, the opposition coalition said in a statement.   ``The wound apparently is not serious; they're giving him firstaid,'' said Maria de Montenegro, a secretary at Endara's office.</TEXT></DOC>
