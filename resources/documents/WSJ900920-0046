According to senior military officers here and inWashington, the Army and Air Force are quietly draftinglong-term plans to stay in the gulf in force. The plans alsocall for leaving behind huge stockpiles of U.S. weapons andequipment for use in any future emergency.</LP><TEXT>   But in Washington, top civilian officials at the Pentagonand elsewhere in the Bush administration strongly denied thatthere is a U.S. policy to establish a permanent presencehere. Their comments could presage an internal battle overwhat to do when the crisis with Iraq ends, pitting theuniformed military against civilian leaders.   Asked about the military planning, chief Pentagonspokesman Pete Williams said flatly: &quot;We have no intention ofdoing that.&quot; He added, &quot;We've been too busy dealing with thecrisis at hand. No one has been authorized to do any planningbeyond that.&quot;   Mr. Williams said, &quot;Maybe somebody is spinning out someeventuality. The Pentagon is a big place, and there are lotsof people in the Pentagon who think they have the bigpicture. But as far as I know, there is no such plan.&quot; StateDepartment officials, who have repeatedly denied any interestin a permanent ground presence here, expressed similarsurprise and dismay at the officers' planning.   Military officers said the plans haven't been approved byDefense Secretary Dick Cheney, Chairman Colin Powell of theJoint Chiefs of Staff, or President Bush. But the planning isbeing handled at a high level in the Army, including someofficers on the staff of Army Chief of Staff Gen. Carl Vuono.And Saudi officials said the issue has been discussedinformally with them.   The Saudis, for their part, appear lukewarm about theidea. &quot;We have strongly resisted such a step over the years,&quot;noted one Saudi official familiar with the latestdiscussions. &quot;But that's clearly what the {U.S.} Army wants,and the opposition may be reduced this time.&quot;   Even informal talk about permanent bases -- a goal theU.S. has sought for years -- could make Arab allies nervousand strain the coalition against Iraq.   Nevertheless, the Army's leadership is quietly draftingplans to maintain at least a heavy mechanized brigade andsupport forces here indefinitely, according to the officers.That would total 7,000 or 8,000 troops, and the Army wants toleave enough hardware on the ground here to support five orsix times that many troops in case of another crisis.   The Air Force, meanwhile, hopes to win permanent bases inOman, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, according tomilitary planners. And the Marines are beating the drums tohave more of their tanks and other weapons placed onpermanent floating storage sites in the Middle East.   The Pentagon's efforts contradict public signals by theBush administration. Just last Friday, on a visit to Syria,Secretary of State Baker declared that &quot;We have no intentionor desire to establish a permanent military ground presencein this region.&quot; After initially hinting that a new &quot;regionalsecurity structure&quot; for the Middle East might involve U.S.troops, Mr. Baker repeatedly has said any U.S. contributionwould be likely to be limited to the naval forces the U.S.has maintained in and near the gulf for 40 years.   Separately, administration officials said they believethat 15 pro-Iranian terrorists, whose fate has been linked tothat of the U.S. hostages in Lebanon, are in Iran or on theirway there. The terrorists, who were being held by Kuwait fora series of 1983 bombings, include the brother-in-law of akidnapper who holds two U.S. hostages in Lebanon and hasdemanded that the group be freed in exchange for the U.S.hostages.   With the prisoners in Iranian hands, another release ofU.S. hostages might be possible. But administration officialsaren't expecting anything soon.   Meanwhile, Iraq announced that it is confiscating assetsof nations that are participating in economic sanctionsagainst Iraq. The order applies to assets of U.S. companiesdoing business in Iraq. The U.S. government didn't have anyimmediate estimate of the value of U.S. assets involved. Thetotal probably isn't great, though.   &quot;It is not clear from the Iraqi statement in what form oragainst whom the action will be taken,&quot; said State Departmentspokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. &quot;In any case, actions likethis can only make it more difficult for Iraq to return tothe international community of nations and to restoreeconomic relations which are crucial for Iraq's long-termdevelopment.&quot;   Meanwhile, the State Department said all Americans whowish to leave Iraq and Kuwait, and who have been permitted todo so by Iraqi authorities, will be flown out by Saturday.Some Americans have chosen to stay, and many others -- mainlymen -- are being refused permission to go.</TEXT></DOC>
