De Mita, leader of the dominant Christian Democrats, wasappointed to the temporary post Wednesday by President FrancescoCossiga.   Premier Giovanni Goria, also a Christian Democrat, resigned lastFriday after heading a shaky five-party coalition for 7{ months.   The 60-year-old De Mita said he would begin negotiations Fridaywith political leaders to form a stronger coalition of theChristian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats, Republicans andLiberals. The five parties have governed together off and on since1981.   ``I know that the task that I am about to take up is difficult,laborious and complex,'' De Mita said. ``There are many questionswe have to face, and to confront them we need political stabilityand clear accords.''   Once De Mita obtains the party leaders' pledges of support, thenext step is informing Cosiga and Parliament, where he must winapproval to become premier. De Mita cannot succeed without supportof the Socialists, the No. 2 party in the coalition.   Socialist leader and former premier Bettino Craxi said Wednesdayhe was not opposed to the appointment of De Mita, with whom he hasoften feuded, but that his final support would depend on governmentpolicy.   Among the divisive issues facing De Mita is Italy's nuclearpolicy. The government's decision last week to resume constructionof a nuclear power plant near Rome angered the Socialists andhelped force Goria to resign.   Also in dispute are the fate of the secret vote in Parliamentand proposals for including the tiny Radical and Green parties inthe coalition.   De Mita was elected in 1982 as secretary of the ChristianDemocrats, a post many consider the most powerful politicalposition in Italy. If he is confirmed as premier, he will keep theposition until the party's congress later this year.   De Mita, son of a tailor, was born in Nusco, a small hill townnear Naples. He entered politics in the 1950s after earning a lawdegree. He was elected to Parliament in 1963 and has held his seatsince then, serving as a minister in several governments in the1970s.</TEXT></DOC>
