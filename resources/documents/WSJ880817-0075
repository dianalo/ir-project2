Unveils 'Coprocessing Board' For Computer Links </HL><SO> </SO><CO> INTC DCA MSFT LOTS TATE </CO><IN> EDP </IN><DATELINE> SANTA CLARA, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Intel Corp. introduced a &quot;coprocessing board&quot; designed to handle communications chores for a personal computer while freeing the machine for other tasks.    At the same time, the chip maker, in a joint announcement with Digital Communications Associates of Alpharetta, Ga., unveiled a set of standard guidelines for software developers. If software concerns incorporate the specifications into their new products -- and a host of industry players yesterday announced that they will -- it will boost the prospective market for Intel's coprocessing product.    Among the software companies announcing support for the standard were industry giants Microsoft Corp., Lotus Development Corp. and Ashton-Tate Co.    The new add-on board, which has a powerful microprocessor and its own memory, takes over communications processing tasks for the computer, so the user can proceed with other jobs during time-consuming phone links. It also acts four to eight times faster than conventional modems currently used in computer communications, Intel said.    The multichip board allows users to easily send computer-generated documents and graphics directly to similarly-equipped PC models or facsimile machines. In the past, the task, if it was possible at all, required a complex set of adjustments. &quot;We're trying to take PC communications out of the hands of hackers and into the hands of business users,&quot; said a spokesman.    Introduction of the coprocessor offers another example of Intel broadening its product base to include more than just computer chips. Earlier this year, the company entered into an agreement with West Germany's Siemens AG to build complete computer systems. The company also sells other add-on boards for personal computers.    The new board, with a suggested retail price of $995, will go on sale in September, Intel said. The company said that the total market for coprocessing boards has been estimated at $24 million this year, growing to $152 million in 1992. </TEXT></DOC>
