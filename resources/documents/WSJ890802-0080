Judge John E. Sprizzo said the FDIC has no legal standing to bring the suit. The judge's decision leaves unresolved the question of whether the city and state properly taxed Bowery Savings.    The suit involves efforts by the city to tax federal aid to savings institutions. The aid was provided under the Garn Act from 1982 through 1987. The Garn Act included a provision that exempted the aid recipients from state and local taxes on deposits and interest.    The FDIC and New York tax officials disagree on when the exemption applies. The FDIC, which guarantees the deposits of savings institutions, says the exemption applies for the entire year in which the institution received aid under the Garn Act. New York officials, however, argue that the exemption should apply only for the part of the year in which aid was received.    New York City collected $1.7 million from Bowery Savings Bank under its interpretation of the law. New York State refunded the money it had collected after agreeing to the federal interpretation.    David Greene, an attorney for the FDIC, said the agency will appeal the judge's decision on the ground that it is the U.S.'s representative for dealing with the savings and loan industry. The judge had ruled that while the U.S. itself would have had standing in filing the suit, the FDIC couldn't because it &quot;isn't an agency which is an integral part&quot; of the government. </TEXT></DOC>
