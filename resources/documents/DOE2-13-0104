Intact tomato plants were used for a time-course study involvingthe uptake of {8-/sup 14/C}-adenine and the tentative identificationof compounds into which the /sup 14/C became incorporated. Using highperformance liquid chromatography, radioactive trans-zeatin was identifiedas being present in the Dowex 50 root extract. The 12-hour time intervalwas used and the roots of the tomato plants were immersed in a more heavilyradiolabelled medium. Modified separation techniques were used to achieveenhanced radioactivity recovery rates. This experiment demonstrated thepresence of relatively high levels of tentatively identified radioactivezeatin in the Dowex 50 root and stem extracts. Radioactivity in the aqueousextracts was found not to be contributed by cytokinin nucleotides. Afinal experiment was carried out using decapitated root systems to determineif the root tissue alone could be implicated in the synthesis of cytokinins.Decapitated tomato root systems were supplied with either {8-/sup 14/C}-adenineor {1-/sup 14/C}-isopentenyl pyrophosphate. The ratio of incorporationof {1-/sup 14/C}-isopentenyl pyrophosphate into identified cytokininswas higher than for {8-/sup 14/C}-adenine. It was concluded that bothadenine and isopentenyl pyrophosphate are involved in the biosyntheticpathway leading to an accumulation of free zeatin derivatives in tomatoroots.</TEXT></DOC>
