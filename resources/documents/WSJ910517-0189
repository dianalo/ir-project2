Advanced Manufacturing andamp; Development Co., a Willits,Calif., technology company, has used $99,800 in state grantsto create a machine for cleansing waste water of pollutants.The cleaning agent: Horse manure. And -- whoa, you naysayers-- it seems to work.</LP><TEXT>   The machine functions on the principal of biodegredation,a long-established way of treating wastes by introducingmicrobes that eat up contaminants. It turns out that horsedroppings contain microbes of such quality, abundance andvariety that some hazardous wastes -- especially water-basedink and paint residues -- are dead meat when they meet ahorse patty. &quot;It just devours them,&quot; says Bill Baxter,Advanced Manufacturing's marketing director.   &quot;It's ironic that waste from a horse can help clean upwastes from industrial processes,&quot; says Kenneth W. Kizer,director of the state health department. &quot;In fact, people'sfirst reaction is to laugh. But it's economical andeffective. There's a lot of this stuff around . . . the inkand paint wastes, I mean.&quot;   The process was dreamed up by Ed Burton, a Willits-basedinventor with 18 patents to his name, many related to wastedisposal and some to horses. In fact, Mr. Burton isconsidered a ranking expert on the chemical properties ofhorse waste, having spent years trying to produce a synthetichorse patty that mushroom farmers could use for growing theirfungi.   He struck out on that one, but in 1988, he took his manuretheories to Advanced Manufacturing, and the new machine wasborn. Called the Bio-Gest, it's about five feet tall andseven feet long. The &quot;filtering medium&quot; -- which the horseprovides -- is encased in a steel cylinder. Contaminatedwater is sprayed over it, the microbes go to work, andeventually all that's left is some carbon dioxide andcleansed water that can be recycled for industrial use. Aspecial exhaust and air-filtration system takes care of anyoffending odors. The machine is already at work in a JamesRiver Corp. potato-chip-wrapper plant and at several othersites in California.   The machine comes ready to use, which is one reason thatMr. Baxter has been spending a lot of time around horseslately. &quot;Fortunately, we're located in a rural area,&quot; hesays. &quot;There are horses around. But if this takes off, we'regoing to have to deal with the race tracks.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
