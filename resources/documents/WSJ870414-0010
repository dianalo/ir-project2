Some 30-year Treasury bonds now offer a yield of nearly 8 3/8%, the highest level in more than a year. As recently as March 26, these issues yielded about 7.55%. Short-term interest rates and municipal bond yields also jumped yesterday.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 51.71 points, the fourth largest point decline in its history, to close at 2287.07. Stocks collapsed in the last hour of trading as the bond markets' slide accelerated on intensified worries about the dollar's plight.    The financial markets were battered by a rumor that a government report to be released today will show the nation's merchandise trade deficit widened significantly to about $18 billion in February from $14.8 billion in January. That would be considerably higher than the $13 billion to $13.5 billion estimate of many economists in several recent surveys.    Speculation also grew yesterday that the Federal Reserve System may be tightening its credit hold slightly in an effort to bolster the dollar and keep inflationary pressures in check. Although many economists contend the Fed hasn't changed policy, bond traders were concerned by yesterday's increase in the closely watched federal funds rate, which often provides clues to changes in Fed policy.    &quot;It was another wild day,&quot; said Raymond W. Stone, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. &quot;People are afraid of the dollar, and there is a lot of talk about the Fed having tightened policy.&quot;    Prices of some 30-year Treasury bonds dropped yesterday by more than 1 3/4 points, or over $17.50 for each $1,000 face amount. That brought the total decline since March 26 to about 8 3/4 points. Some seven-year Treasury notes now yield about 8%, an increase from 7 1/8% just over two weeks ago.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell to its lowest level since June 5 of last year. The index dropped 20.88 points to close 1318.98, only slightly above its lowest level of the day of 1317.88. The high for the day was 1345.48.    The bond markets' slump deepened in the afternoon as the trade deficit rumor spread. Among the other major developments yesterday:    --Rates on new short-term Treasury bills sold by the government yesterday jumped to their highest levels in nearly a year. The average rate on new 13-week bills rose to 5.98% from an average of 5.53% at last week's auction, while the average rate on new 26-week bills rose to 6.08% from 5.63% last week.    --Municipal bond prices also dropped sharply, with some issues falling by as much as 2 7/8 points. In the past week alone, yields on some high-grade tax-exempt bonds have jumped to nearly 7 3/4% from 7 1/8%, said Sylvan Feldstein, vice president and manager of the municipal bond research department at Merrill Lynch.    --The mortgage-backed securities market was hit especially hard. Some actively traded issues plunged by nearly 2 3/4 points in hectic trading. &quot;It was a real bloodbath,&quot; said Charles Lieberman, senior vice president and director of financial markets research at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.    --Corporate bonds fell, too, although generally not as far as Treasury issues. But Texaco Inc.'s bonds were clobbered in the wake of the company's filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. One analyst estimated that prices on some Texaco issues fell as much as 25% from last Friday. However, trading volume was so light in Texaco bonds, and spreads between bid and asked prices were so wide, that it was hard to gauge where the bonds will settle.    --The federal funds rate rose to an average of 6.57%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) from 6.35% last Friday. The funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged 6.13% in the week ended last Wednesday.    --Several bankers raised their broker-loan rates. Bankers Trust Co. raised its broker-loan rate to 7 1/2% from 7 1/4%, while U.S. Trust Co. boosted its rate to 7 3/4% from 7 1/2%. The broker-loan rate is the rate banks charge securities dealers on loans backed by stock.    Higher short-term rates could be a harbinger of another prime-rate increase. Some analysts predict banks will boost their prime rate to 8% from 7 3/4% within a few days because of recent increases in banks' own borrowing costs.    The prime rate is the rate banks use as a benchmark on loans to many small and medium-sized businesses, as well as on numerous types of consumer loans. It stood at 7 1/2% from last August until about two weeks ago when banks, led by Citibank, raised it by a quarter of a percentage point. That represented the first nationwide increase in the prime since mid-1984.    Although the federal funds rate increase jarred bond traders, many economists insisted that the rise merely reflected seasonal pressures in the banking system, rather than any change in Federal Reserve policy. They said the funds rate often rises around the April 15 tax date because of temporary shortages of bank reserves, and some contended the funds rate will drift back soon to the 6% to 6 1/8% range.    &quot;It is premature to jump to the conclusion that the Fed has tightened,&quot; said Mr. Stone of Merrill Lynch. The rise in the funds rate &quot;probably was related to the April 15 tax date, which often causes temporary congestion in the markets,&quot; he said. Moreover, he said, a credit-tightening move by the Fed seems unlikely in view of recent comments by a few Fed officials indicating that the Fed is eager to await more economic news before changing policy.    Tightening credit conditions now also could run the risk of depressing the economy at a time when many analysts fear the lengthy expansion is running out of steam. &quot;I don't think they (Fed officials) have tightened,&quot; said Mr. Lieberman of Manufacturers Hanover. &quot;But the higher fed funds rate has caused a lot of people to assume the Fed is tightening.&quot;    Increases in most commodity prices yesterday heightened investor concern about the inflation outlook and thus exacerbated the bond markets' woes. Bond traders were especially concerned about increases in precious metals prices.    Gold, silver and platinum prices rose yesterday for the seventh time in the past nine sessions. &quot;You're seeing inflation creeping back into the system,&quot; said E. Craig Coats Jr., a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc.    &quot;But the thing that really caused the downdraft&quot; in the bond markets yesterday afternoon was the rumor about the trade deficit, Mr. Coats said. Several other traders echoed this view. &quot;If that rumor is true (about an $18 billion trade deficit in February), then you better get out of the way of the market&quot; today, said a Treasury bond trader at one large New York bank.    According to the average estimate of 14 economists surveyed by the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the trade deficit narrowed to $13.3 billion in February from the preliminary January level of $14.8 billion. A separate survey of 32 analysts by Money Market Services Inc. of Redwood City, Calif., showed a median estimate of a $13 billion deficit, with individual estimates ranging from $11.5 billion to $16 billion.    In the badly battered municipal bond market, some analysts contend that prices have fallen so sharply that tax-exempt bonds now represent attractive buys. &quot;Municipal bond yields have gone up more than U.S. Treasury bonds in the last week, yet the fundamentals in the municipal market are still positive,&quot; said Mr. Feldstein of Merrill Lynch. The new tax law, he said, will mean increased investor demand for tax-exempt income and it also imposes tough new restrictions on issuance of tax-free bonds.    In the Treasury bond market yesterday, the government's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 traded as high as 92 3/4 before dropping to 90 21/32 late in the day from 92 1/2 last Friday. The yield rose to 8.36% from 8.17%. The Treasury's 7 1/4% notes due in 1996 fell to 93 3/4 yesterday from 95 14/32, as the yield rose to 8.20% from 7.94%.    Here are details of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                 13-Week          26-Week  Applications ........... $25,990,170,000   $24,696,935,000  Accepted bids ........... $6,608,360,000    $6,607,550,000  Accepted at low price .............. 60%               48%  Accepted noncompet'ly ... $1.202,475,000      $831,640,000  Average price (Rate) .... 98.488 (5.98%)    96.926 (6.08%)  High price (Rate) ....... 98.504 (5.92%)    96.977 (5.98%)  Low price (Rate) ........ 98.486 (5.99%)    96.916 (6.10%)  Coupon equivalent ................ 6.17%             6.38%   Both issues are dated April 16.
