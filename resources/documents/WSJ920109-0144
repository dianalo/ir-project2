Butpeople keep giving them to him.   Dr. Katz, a veterinarian, is president of a group calledIn Defense of Animals, which last month sponsored a &quot;FurAmnesty&quot; program as a way for people to &quot;clean both theirclosets and their conscience.&quot; Nearly $120,000 of pelts havepoured in, including a garment made from a long-hairedmonkey, a coat adorned with baby raccoon tails, and a stolefeaturing a fox's head. On Friday, the group received an$8,000 mink coat in the mail.</LP><TEXT>   In addition to being tax deductions, the donations helppeople &quot;resolve feelings of conflict,&quot; says Dr. Katz. Theyallow people to &quot;get rid of the terrible skeletons they'vehad in their closets for so many years.&quot;   Dr. Katz says: &quot;We discovered people were embarrassed toadmit {they owned fur}. They had these for years, but didn'ttell anybody. They didn't know the costs involved when theyreceived them. They were ashamed.&quot; Reformed fur addicts need&quot;compassion and understanding.&quot;   June Josey, a self-described &quot;former fur junkie,&quot; says shehad been &quot;purchasing fur all my life.&quot; She grew up in Dallas,where &quot;it was a sign of wealth. Every woman wanted one.&quot;   Now that she's &quot;more aware of the plight of animals,&quot; shedecided it was time to shed her collection. She gave away 15furs valued at $50,000. &quot;I was kind of embarrassed to go in,&quot;she says. &quot;I was afraid they'd make fun of me. But everybodywas so nice about it.&quot; Being fur-free is fun, she says,though &quot;not as warm. Sometimes I don't know what to wear.Cloth coats are not quite the same.&quot;   Cast-off furs will be used in demonstrations intended to&quot;parody those who think they look beautiful in fur,&quot; says Dr.Katz. In the past, group members calling themselves &quot;TheVicious Vixens,&quot; have ridden around San Francisco in cablecars, wearing too much makeup and flaunting furs. In Defenseof Animals contends &quot;furs have gone out of style due topublicity about the fur trade's cruelty to animals.&quot;   That's &quot;so untrue,&quot; says a spokeswoman for the FurInformation Council of America. Fur sales have fallen, shesays, but &quot;totally&quot; because of sluggish economic conditions.&quot;The public still loves fur. It's a great fashion thing.&quot; Andas for the claims of animal activists, she says, &quot;people arereally tired of them. It's been beaten to death.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
