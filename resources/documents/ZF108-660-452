$1,699 with hard disk and black-and-white VGA;$1,999 with hard disk and color.andM;In Short: A bold attempt to reach America at home, this 10-MHz 286 has VGAand a simple mouse-driven interface.andM;This is not the kind of machine you expected to see on the cover of PCMagazine.andM;80286-based PCs have been studiously ignored by the magazine's editors sinceSeptember, 1989, when we published our last roundup of entry-level 286s.andP;  Butanyone who ignores the PS/1 today will miss the biggest effort ever mountedto conquer computing's last great frontier-the home.andM;The PS/1, whose models range from $ 1,000 to  2,000, is a system designed tosolve the problems that have kept millions of Americans from buying a homePC.andP;  Rejecting the conventional wisdom guiding virtually every computerproject, IBM built a machine driven by the market, rather than technology-amachine that doesn't require hours of configuration, doesn't force a wholenew vocabulary on the casual computer user, and doesn't put too serious adent in the budget.andM;The PS/1 is designed to be as easy to buy, use and maintain as a microwaveoven.andP;  IBM plans to support it with banks of 800-number technicians, and twoseparate on-line services.andP;  If there's a mechanical failure, IBM says it willimmediately dispatch an overnight shipment with the part or unit.andM;That's right.andP;  You don't go back to the store, you call IBM.andP;  IBM promises toanswer the phone and actually help the owner of a personal computer solve amechanical problem.andM;The PS/1's design lends itself to this kind of service.andP;  The base unit is amere 10 pounds, and is not much larger than a DOS manual box.andM;The machine will never make a power user happy.andP;  Upgrade options are severelylimited.andP;  In miniaturizing the PS/1 footprint, IBM left out the expansionslots.andP;  There are three proprietary slots for additional memory, a joystick,a MIDI adapter and an expansion chassis.andP;  However, even the chassis islimited to three AT-bus cards.andP;  On the other hand, the machine comes equippedwith on-board VGA, a mouse port, an internal 2,400-bit-per-secondHayes-compatible modem, 3.5-inch 1.44MB floppy drive, and a parallel port.andP;  Amouse comes standard with all models.andM;There's no power supply inside the chassis.andP;  It's housed in the monitor, sothat two cables run between system and display.andP;  This design makes itpossible to have a single AC socket and on/off switch.andM;IBM VS.andP;  TANDYandM;IBM may have been too quick to crimp the upgrade plans of its PS/1 owners,but it's convinced that the typical family-oriented buyer is more concernedwith size and cost than expansion.andP;  To determine whether the PS/1 is really agood value, I compared the top-of-the-line model with a comparably configured$2,100 Tandy 1000TL/2.andM;It was impossible to match the configurations exactly.andP;  In order to comparemachines that cost roughly the same, we had to use a Tandy with a smallerhard disk (20MB instead of 30MB).andP;  The Tandy also uses a slower 80286 chip (8MHz instead of 10 MHz), and a slower hard disk (70-millisecond average accesstime instead of 23 ms.).andP;  The Tandy's Super CGA level display doesn't hold upwell next to IBM's VGA, and the standard 3.5-inch disk on the IBM is highdensity, while Tandy economizes with low density.andM;Both give you a parallel port.andP;  IBM has a built-in modem but no serial port.andO;Tandy has a serial port, but the mouse claimed it in our test configuration.andO;By this count IBM provides a better port configuration (assuming you'd add amouse and a modem to the Tandy).andM;In Tandy's favor, the sound facility (using a proprietary chip) is standard,with the microphone and earphone jacks right on the front panel.andP;  IBM's MIDIoption will cost $249 when it ships later in the year.andM;And, Tandy gives you two joystick ports; IBM offers one, and only when youbuy the MIDI option.andM;The keyboards use exactly the same layout; both are full 101 -key keyboardswith good tactile response.andP;  IBM's is lighter, which may be more appealing toparents of small children.andM;Both systems shield new users from the DOS prompt with their own auto-bootingshell interface.andP;  They also both give you the option of bypassing theseopening menus in favor of DOS.andM;IBM is likely to win big with its PS/1 interface, especially with new users.andO;This truly is a user-friendly, clean face.andP;  Using a mouse, you can find yourway to software in a matter of seconds.andP;  In contrast, Tandy's DeskMateinterface suffers because it feels cluttered with a grabag of commands, someuseful, some rarely needed.andM;The PS/1 will put you into DOS 4.0 as one of its four basic options, or itwill guide you into applications through a painfully obvious system.andP;  Sincethe DOS system kernel resides in ROM, frightening &quot;non-system disk&quot; errorswill never be a problem.andP;  The system also comes with a tutorial at the&quot;this-is-a-floppy-disk&quot; level.andM;The menu shell conveniently steers users into Prodigy, the on-line serviceIBM co-owns with Sears.andP;  The match between a PS/1 and Prodigy is apparent:anyone who is attracted to Prodigy's boldly graphical menu choices will beright at home with PS/1's similar style.andP;  IBM plans to provide productsupport via Prodigy, but it has also established a separate PS/1 onlineservice, called Promenade, that's run by Quantum Computer Services and comespre-installed on hard disk models.andM;The healthy amount of software on the hard disk (Microsoft Works is alsoinstalled) and the ease of getting started with the hard disk-equippedmodels, make them a far better buy.andP;  In fact, if you choose to recommend aPS/1 to someone you hope to remain friendly with, steer them away from thefloppy-based machines.andP;  The hard disk is fast and well worth the extra cost.andO;Initially, IBM will sell PS/1s only in Dallas, Chicago, and Minneapolis butplans national distribution in time for Christmas.andM;The PS/1 line includes four models that use the same 10-MHz 80286, but differin display resolutions, hard disk configuration, and RAM.andP;  The $999 basemodel has 512K of RAM, no hard disk and a VGA monochrome monitor (IBM callsthis a &quot;PhotoGraphic&quot; display, but it's just a marketing slogan for astandard monochrome VGA display).andP;  The next model supports color VGA, andlists for $1,499.andM;The lowest-level hard disk model is the same as the base model, but it has a30MB hard disk and 640K of RAM; the list price is $1,699.andP;  The $1,999top-of-the-line machine has a full 640K of RAM, a 30MB hard disk and colorVGA.andM;These aren't bargain prices if you're familiar with companies like Zeos,Gateway, and Northgate, and appreciate the 386SX machines they sell for$2,000.andM;And competition for the home market is mounting from other quarters, such asthe CDROM-equipped Vendex Headstart and Fujitsu's FM-Townes systems.andP;  But ifyou compare it with a direct competitor-Tandy's 1000TL/2-the price holds uppretty well.andM;No, the PS/1 isn't a system for the PC Magazine reader; but it may be asystem you can comfortably recommend to your next-door neighbor.andM;And it's certainly easy to find conceptual flaws with the PS/1.andP;  The monitorshouldn't house the power supply.andP;  And, the monitor is too heavy and needs aswivel-tray.andM;Still, it's hard to condemn a machine that comes with such noble intentions.andO;IBM did the important things right: it delivered the best of today'sstandards at a reasonable price.andP;  If IBM has correctly identified the hasslesthat make most Americans shy away from a PC, the two hard disk-equippedPS/1's will become runaway best-sellers.andP;  They deliver no-hassle computingfor beginners.andP;  And that's saying a lot.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
