Two teams of U.S. researchers reported they hadsuccessfully engineered &quot;foreign&quot; genes from viruses andbacteria into a bacterium, known as the BCG microbe, thatalready is widely used as a vaccine against tuberculosis.When the genetically engineered BCG organism was used as avaccine in mice, the rodents showed signs of developingfull-scale immunity against the viruses and bacteria.</LP><TEXT>   Present vaccines each immunize only against a singledisease, although most children receive a combination of fourvaccines in a single shot against diphtheria, pertussis,tetanus and polio.   The experiments, reported in this week's issue of thescientific journal Nature, suggest it may be possible to usethe genetically engineered BCG microbe as a one-shot vaccinethat could immunize a person against several diseasessimultaneously, including tetanus, diptheria, hepatitis, Lymedisease, measles and malaria. The technique might also beused as a vaccine against acquired immunodeficiency syndrome,or AIDS.   The immediate beneficiary of the experiments, however, isa Gaithersburg, Md., biotechnology company, MedImmune Inc. InMay, MedImmune raised $24.7 million in a public offering thatattracted investors partly because of the company's researchon the &quot;multivalent&quot; vaccine made with the geneticallyengineered BCG microbe.   MedImmune obtained rights to the BCG-based vaccinetechnology from three academic institutions, the WhiteheadInstitute at Massachusetts Institute of Technology inCambridge, Mass., the Albert Einstein College of Medicine inNew York and Stanford University in Stanford, Calif.   MedImmune's research in using the BCG microbe for avaccine against the virus that causes AIDS is being funded byMerck andamp; Co. while work on a BCG-type vaccine against Lymedisease and hepatitis B is being funded by ConnaughtLaboratories Inc., Swiftwater, Pa.   In their newly published reports, two scientific teamsnote that the BCG microbe is ideal for a vaccine. In the past40 years it has been used as a tuberculosis vaccine in morethan two billion people and is safe enough to be given tonewborn infants. BCG stands for bacille Calmette-Guerin,named after the two French scientists who developed thetuberculosis bacillus, or bacterium, as a vaccine.   The trick pulled off by both teams of U.S. scientists wasto get various foreign genes inserted into the BCG bacterium.They also had to ensure that the inserted genes would producetheir &quot;foreign&quot; proteins in the BCG bacterium in a way thatthe proteins would be exposed to the immune system of themice (or humans) so that an immunity could be built up.   Genes taken from the AIDS virus and from the microbe thatcauses tetanus, or &quot;lockjaw,&quot; as well as a gene for a commonenzyme were successfully inserted into the BCG bacterium by ateam from Albert Einstein College, the University ofPittsburgh and MedImmune. They added that they also hadinserted genes from 17 other viral, bacterial and parasiticmicrobes into BCG but didn't give details. A team from theWhitehead Institute reported they had successfully insertedthree genes from the AIDS virus into BCG.   Both teams said mice vaccinated with the geneticallyengineered BCG developed a surprising across-the-boardimmunity to the proteins produced by the inserted genes. Themice developed antibodies to the proteins, as is common withvaccines against viruses. But the mice also developed whiteblood cells, called T lymphocytes, that are capable ofattacking and destroying foreign cells such as bacteria. Theanimals also began producing such substances as interferon,which the body uses to ward off infections.</TEXT></DOC>
