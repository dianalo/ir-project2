Its variability is used quiteincorrectly as an argument against wind power but in fact the extra capacitythat has to be installed to generate a given annual energy exactly compensatesfor the lower load factor at times of peak demand. It is shown mathematicallythat, to first order, the contribution of any item of power plant forfirm capacity is equal to the average power it can generate. This conclusionis true whatever the load factor or availability of the power plant andhowever firm (or otherwise) the power system.</TEXT></DOC>
