The party's top officials, led by Kohl, met in Bonn to assessthe damage done to the conservative Christian Democrats in theSunday elections in the northern West German state.   The results marked one of the worst defeats for the governingparty since Kohl took office five years ago.   The Schleswig-Holstein poll also was a decisive victory for theopposition Social Democrats, who had lost ground in a string ofstate elections over the past 18 months.   While the Schleswig-Holstein election will have little immediateeffect on Kohl's coalition government in Bonn, it will boost theSocial Democrats' flagging morale nationwide.   The results may also increase bickering with Kohl's oftenfractious three-party federal coalition.   The election will also narrow, but leave intact, the ChristianDemocratic majority in the Bundesrat, or upper house of the WestGerman parliament.   Unofficial results showed the Christian Democrats polled 33.3percent of the vote, which was called to break the stalemate in thestate's government that followed an inconclusive election inSeptember 1987. In the September vote, the Christian Democrats hadpolled 42.6 percent of the vote.   The Social Democrats posted a surprising 54.8 percent of thevote, well above the 45.2 percent it polled in September, accordingto the unofficial figures.   The results were the best-ever posted by the Social Democrats inSchleswig-Holstein, and gave the party 46 of the 74 seats in thestate's parliament.   The liberal Free Democratic party _ the junior party in Kohl'sgoverning coalition _ also posted decisive losses, falling from 5.2percent of the vote in September to 4.4 percent Sunday.   The loss was key because it means the Free Democrats failed towin 5 percent of the vote, and are thus barred from taking anyparliamentary seats under West German law.   The environmental Greens party also failed to win parliamentaryseats, posting just 2.9 percent of the vote, well below the 3.9percent it won in September.   Under West German voting procedures, it will be several daysbefore the results, based on reported returns from pollingstations, are verified and declared final.   Political analysts say the Social Democratic majority assuresthat the state governor's post will go to Bjoern Engholm, who ledthe opposition party through what was a largely lackluster campaign.   Engholm was the target of a political dirty tricks campaign lastyear by former Christian Democratic governor Uwe Barschel.   After the campaign came to light, Barschel was found dead in aGeneva hotel in October, and authorities ruled the death anapparent suicide.</TEXT></DOC>
