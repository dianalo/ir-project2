Chinese leaders, in meetings publicizing the new figure, saidChina will have difficulty feeding and housing itself if populationgrowth is not checked.   The People's Daily said in an editorial that the largepopulation ``has become the main obstacle to the development of theeconomy.''   China reached the 1.1 billion figure a little more than sevenyears after becoming the world's first nation with 1 billion people.   The government had wanted to limit the population to 1.2 billionin the year 2000, but officials and experts now acknowledge thegoal is impossible.   Estimates for the number of Chinese at the turn of the centuryhave jumped to 1.3 billion, which would be about 20 percent of thetotal world population.   China Daily quoted Vice Premier Tian Jiyun as saying 20 millionmore Chinese would be born every year over the next decade ifrecent birth rates remain unchanged.   In 1988, China recorded 23 million births and 7 million deathsas a baby boom generation from the 1960s entered its child-bearingyears and defiance of state birth control policies spread.   China in 1980 adopted a policy calling for late marriages andone child per family. Couples giving birth to more than one childare fined or lose various social benefits.   It is estimated that China's population would have grown by anadditional 100 million during the past decade without the statepolicy. The nationwide population growth was held to only 11 per1,000 in 1985, a figure well below those of most developingcountries.   However, the growth rate rose to 14 out of 1,000 in 1986 and 16out of 1,000 in 1987 because of the second wave of the baby boomand the unpopularity of the one-child policy in rural areas.   The return of family farming has made farmers rich enough to payfines for having extra children and has increased the need forchildren, particularly boys, to help cultivate the land.   According to one recent survey, since 1980 about 9 millionbabies a year have been born outside the state plan, and less than60 percent of women of child-bearing age practice birth control.   Tian noted the recent relaxation of the one-child policy in thecountryside, saying families who experience difficulties, includingthose families with one daughter, may have a second child after aninterval of several years.   He said that ``under no circumstances'' should a couple havethree or more children.</TEXT></DOC>
