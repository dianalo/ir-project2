Col. Peter Kutscherasaid following Monday's report in the New York Post. ``To implythat this is a sham or conscious effort to mislead the Pentagonisn't borne out by the facts.''   Gov. Mario Cuomo's spokesman, Steve Villano, said, ``The stateinspector general is looking at it and because of this pendinginvestigation it would be inappropriate for us to comment anyfurther.'' Villano said other investigations had been conducted.   The Post said no-show soldiers had been kept on the Guard'srosters for at least six years, giving the Pentagon the falseimpression that the Guard is ready for war or national disaster.   Kutschera said he was particularly disturbed by the assertionthat the Guard was not prepared for war, and said a ``vast number''had been judged to be combat-ready.   Asked how many units were combat-ready, he replied, ``That'svery close to being classified information.''   The Post said the New York Guard's budget has tripled to $390million a year since 1975 despite having the second worstattendance record in the nation.   The newspaper said it determined that Vito Castellano, Guardcommander from 1975 to 1986, created a phantom force in 1984.   Castellano, who reportedly retired under pressure, was releasedfrom prison in July after serving a year for taking bribes andusing his position to lobby for Wedtech, a defunct defensecontractor.   The Post said a high-ranking Guard official who asked not to befurther identified said he followed Castellano's orders to list2,500 phantom soldiers on the roster.   The Post, citing a confidential draft report prepared forManhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, also said Castellanoadmitted to prosecutors two years ago that he put phantom soldierson the Guard's roster.   There was no answer at a suburban telephone listed underCastellano's name. His former attorney, Edwin Silberling, no longerpractices law and did not know how to reach Castellano.   The Post said 1,600 to 4,000 no-show New York Guard soldiersremain absent without leave and should be dismissed.   No-shows are not paid, but the Post said the Pentagon providesfunds for their equipment and training.   Kutscher said that was not true. ``Federal money for equipmentallocated to the National Guard is not based on drill attendancebut on the authorized level of equipment in the organizationitself,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
