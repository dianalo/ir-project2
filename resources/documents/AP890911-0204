It's a new tourist draw and Washingtonians are puttingout the welcome mat with a little home-brewed romance.</TEXT><BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Romantic dinner trains rumble throughcanyons, famous musicians perform along the Columbia River, andbed-and-breakfast inns seem as ubiquitous as apple trees.   It's a long way from California's Napa Valley, but centralWashington's wine country is slowly developing into a touristattraction.   As many as 300,000 people a year visit state wineries where anarray of facilities and activities are being developed toaccommodate them.   ``The wineries have drawn an awful lot of people here,'' saysGary Hogue, president of the Hogue Cellars winery near Prosser.``Therefore the need for goods and services follow.''   Still, there's no mistaking the area for Napa North, even thoughWashington trails only California and New York in wine production.   The Napa Valley has more than 250 wineries crowded into a 30-milelong area, with attractions and services for more than 2.5 millionvisitors a year.   Central Washington, by contrast, has about 35 wineries scatteredacross 180 miles, from Wenatchee to Walla Walla, many in small townslacking sophisticated amenities.   ``Look at Napa 15 years ago and it was similar to what we havenow,'' says Randy Tucker, director of Tucker Cellars in Sunnyside.``There were no motels, no restaurants, no bed-and-breakfasts.   ``I think the wine industry has laid the groundwork for bringingpeople in in large numbers.''   Already there are signs of change.   The Champs de Brionne Winery, outside George, Wash., for severalyears has booked big-name musical performers such as Bob Dylan, RodStewart and the Judds at its natural amphitheater above the ColumbiaRiver. They draw up to 17,000 people to a town with a population ofjust 260. The winery's products are the only liquor that can bebrought into the shows.   Recently Washington Central Railroad Co. began operating dinnertrains that include winery stops.   The Friday dinner and Sunday brunch train departs Yakima for thecollege town of Ellensburg, where riders spend a half-hour at theCascade Crest Estates Winery in the converted railroad depot as theengine is turned around.   On Saturday night the dinner train runs from Kennewick toProsser, stopping at the Hogue Cellars. The three-hour rides cost$45 a person.   ``I think it's good for the wineries and good for thepassengers,'' says Brig Temple, manager of the dinner trains for therailroad. ``Some out-of-town passengers get a chance to taste thelocal flavors. It adds to the trip.''   Another sign of tourism's impact is Tucker Cellar's decision tobuild a tasting room in Yakima, in addition to its winery tastingroom 40 miles south in Sunnyside. The downtown Yakima facility isdesigned to draw some of the convention visitors to centralWashington's largest city, Tucker says.   ``They don't have time to go through the valley,'' he says.   Washington has more than 70 wineries, with about half clusteredin the fruit-growing central region. The rest are scattered inwestern Washington, with a handful in the Spokane area.   Studying reports from 33 wineries across the state, from May toSeptember of 1987, a Washington State University survey found thatvisitors ranged from 12 a month at one remote winery to 5,500 amonth at the busiest one.   ``The average age of the visitors was 40 years old and theaverage income was estimated at $40,000 per year,'' Folwell says,adding most of the visitors lived in Washington.   Large-scale wine production is only about a decade old inWashington, and Gail Thompson of the state Department of Tourismsays promotion of the wineries to out-of-state visitors is still inits infancy.   ``We haven't been in the business of promoting visitors for yearsand years, like the California wine country,'' Ms. Thompson says,noting that one problem was inadequate maps on winery brochures todirect visitors to some of the most remote locations.   But everywhere there seems to be an awakening.   Wil Masset, owner of Yakima's Birchfield Manor, recently opened afive-room inn above his gourmet restaurant.   ``There were six wineries in the state when we came,'' Massetsays. ``Now there are really super deluxe facilities a few milesfrom here.''   Another inn opened recently in Sunnyside. Three have opened inProsser in the past year, along with a 30-unit motel.   Festivals provide the busiest weekends for the wineries,including the spring barrel tasting when thousands of visitorssample newly made wines right from the barrel.   Tucker says 3,500 people visited his winery over that weekend.   But for all the activity, winery owners are aware that centralWashington will never rival the Napa Valley, located near SanFrancisco, primarily because the population density is just notthere, Hogue says.   As lively as the tourist business is, the wineries rely on salesto retail stores for volume. Only 13 percent of total production issold by the tasting rooms _ just about two bottles to the customer.</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
