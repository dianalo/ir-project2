Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown, Mayor David Dinkins andGov. Mario Cuomo used a desk Wednesday in City Hall that belongedto George Washington to sign a contract making New York City theconvention site.   ``We won't let you down,'' Dinkins told Brown, an old friend andnative New Yorker. ``New York is a great convention town.''   The convention at Madison Square Garden is expected to pump $100million into the New York economy and bring 35,000 delegates,guests and journalists to town.   ``Democrats will nominate the next president of the UnitedStates two years from now this week in America's most dynamic cityand in one of the world's greatest cities _ New York, the BigApple,'' Dinkins said.   The race for the Democratic presidential nominee is wide open.   New York was chosen over New Orleans as the convention site.   Brown said New Orleans' chances were hurt by the LouisianaLegislature's passage of strong anti-abortion legislation, but thatwas not the deciding factor.   New York's early pledge to come up with the more than $20million for the convention and a pledge by prominent Democraticfund-raisers in the city to fill the party's coffers helpedpersuade Brown.   New York had the convention in 1976, when Jimmy Carter wasnominated and won the presidency, and in 1980, when Carter wasrenominated and lost.</TEXT></DOC>
