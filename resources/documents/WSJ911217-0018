Traders expect activity to lighten even more duringthe week, as the market approaches the Christmas holidays andFriday's expiration of key index options and futures. Thecoinciding expirations -- called a &quot;triple witching hour&quot; --trigger massive trades in index futures, options and theirunderlying stocks.   Concerns about the likely zigzags in stock prices are&quot;keeping a lot of people out of the marketplace,&quot; said EdwardLaux head trader at Kidder Peabody.   But other factors helped to boost stock prices yesterday,notably the hope that the Federal Reserve Board will lowerthe discount rate, the rate it charges on short-term loans tobanks, after the meeting of the Open Market Committee today.   The announcement last week that the producer-price indexclimbed only by 0.2% in November heightened speculation thatthe rate could be eased without triggering inflation. TheFed's announcement yesterday that U.S. industrial productionin November fell a seasonally adjusted 0.4% bolstered feelingthat an easing is necessary to help the economy.   Tom Gallagher, head trader at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., saidgroups that have been battered for months are experiencingsmall upsurges as bargain hunters lap up what's been sold byinvestors looking to record their tax losses for the year.   Oil drilling stocks gained yesterday, in spite oflanguishing oil prices. Energy Service Co. jumped 1/8 to 15/8; Rowan Cos. gained 1/8 to 5 5/8; and Global Marine added1/8 to 2 1/8. Heavy construction companies also showed gains:Fluor added 1 3/8 to 40 1/8, Morrison Knudsen gained 1 1/8 to45 1/4 and Foster Wheeler added 3/8 to 23 5/8.   While such pressure may be contributing to an ongoingrally in stocks, Kidder's Mr. Laux isn't certain that thetraditional rally in January will be particularly strong.   &quot;There will be a lot of things to watch come January: whatmoves the Bush administration makes, how Christmas retailsales were and what the earnings for the fourth quarterwere,&quot; he said. &quot;But it's hard to get enamored of a Januaryeffect when the market's already up at very lofty levels.&quot;   Perhaps in anticipation of a troubled January, consumernon-durable stocks, known as defensive investments, alsoheaded up yesterday.
