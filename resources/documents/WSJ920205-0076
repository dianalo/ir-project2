As a result, the brokerage subsidiary of American ExpressCo. is expected to keep the mortgage unit as an &quot;ongoingbusiness&quot; and sell only the home-equity loan portion of theoperations.</LP><TEXT>   Shearson confirmed the plans. But it declined to identifythe potential buyer of the home-equity portion, saying onlyit was a &quot;financial institution.&quot;   The home-equity loan portfolio, with $600 million inloans, represents more than half of the mortgage unit'sassets. Upon completion of the sale, the remaining unit wouldconcentrate on originating and servicing first mortgages,Shearson said.   Shearson had reached a tentative agreement last Decemberwith the group, which included Middle Eastern investors. Thetermination of the tentative agreement to sell the entirehome-mortgage business represents a minor setback forAmerican Express, which is looking to raise capital tostrengthen its core businesses.
