(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hurricane Hugo punched this city ofantebellum mansions with full fury and killed at least 12 people inthe Carolinas before weakening Friday and trailing off inland to thenorth.   South Carolina's barrier islands were also hit hard as houseswere blown off their foundations and boats were pushed ashore,stacked along the beaches two and three deep.   ``Garden City for all practical purposes is gone,'' said M.L.Love, a Horry County administrator who toured the elite resortcommunity near Myrtle Beach.   President Bush declared seven counties a federal disaster area.   ``It is the worst storm, the worst disaster, I've ever seenanywhere,'' said Gov. Carrolll Campbell.   Hugo, downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m., had lost allcharacteristics of tropical storm and was weakening, although thesystem had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and torrential rains.   The storm's last location was in Pennsylvania, just west ofPittsburgh, at latitude 40.5 degrees north and longitude 81 degreeswest. Officials said there would be no further tracking.   Campbell toured his state Friday by air, stopping to assist somepeople who waved him down for help.   About 50 people in the small coastal community of McClellanvillewere stranded by the storm, and some were standing on top of carsand waving at the passing helicopter.   Campbell's helicopter landed in a nearby baseball field, and thegovernor made sure the people got help. ``There are a lot of littleplaces like that in this state that just got wiped out,'' Campbellsaid.   Eleven of the U.S. deaths were in South Carolina, said WarrenHardy of the state's Office of Emergency Preparedness. The SouthCarolina deaths included an elderly man found in the rubble of ahouse in Charleston, and a power company employee who waselectrocuted Friday as he worked to restore electricity. In NorthCarolina, a 6-month-old baby was killed in Union County when a treefell on a house.   The center of the storm advanced farther west than expected,targeting eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania and western New Yorkbefore it was expected to wear itself out in Canada. It was movingto the north at 30 mph.   A hurricane is a heat engine fueled by warm, moist air over openoceans. When these giant storms hit land, they lose their wallop,although they can still manage considerable bluster.   Charleston, S.C., felt the full wrath of Hugo, which wrecked astring of Caribbean resort islands beginning early Sunday. As manyas 27 people were killed in the Caribbean. About 50,000 people arehomeless.   The city where the first shots of the Civil War were fired in1861 was clobbered with 135 mph winds and a tidal surge of 12 to 17feet. The storm, which at its height was as large as the state ofSouth Carolina, flattened 30 buildings, peeled off roofs and floodedstreets. Several people were believed trapped in a buildingcollapse. Officials later said no one was found inside.   ``There's just destruction everywhere,'' said Mayor Joseph P.Riley, who imposed a 6 p.m. curfew. He called it a ``disaster ofextraordinary dimensions.''   Riley estimated damage at $1 billion in the city of 65,000residents.   National Guardsman patrolled streets, and Campbell confirmedthere was sporadic looting before authorities restored order.   Jo Smith rode out the storm in her 100-year-old house across fromthe Medical University of South Carolina, but said Friday she wishedshe would have left town.   ``I thought I was going to die,'' she said. ``The house wasshaking. I could hear pieces of tin flying off (my) roof.''   At least 900,000 people were without power in the Carolinas,officials said. The total included 200,000 or 85 percent of thehomes and businesses in Charlotte, N.C., which felt Hugo's muscleeven though it's 200 miles inland. The fraud and conspiracy trial ofPTL founder Jim Bakker was canceled Friday because of the storm.   In addition to flooding, fires from natural gas leaks erupted inlow-lying Charleston, where some tree-lined streets were underseveral feet of water.   At least 20 boats washed ashore, including a 50-foot craft thatwashed up on a city street, Police Chief Reuben Greenberg said.   Most of the historic antebellum mansions facing Charleston Harborweathered the storm with little cosmetic damage, officials said.   But Fort Sumter, the first Union holding fired upon by theConfederacy at the beginning of the Civil War, suffered $1 milliondamage when a 17-foot wall of water passed over it, according toConstance Harriman, assistant secretary of the interior for parksand wildlife.   The Pentagon reported Friday that its Air Force base nearCharleston appears to have sustained ``catastrophic levels ofdamage,'' according to a statement issued in Washington.   Seventy miles up the coast, the elite vacation retreat communityof Garden City was smashed, officials said. It was among thecommunities under an evacuation order before Hugo hit.   Love said destruction extended ``as far as I could see.''   On Pawleys Island, south of Myrtle Beach, authorities said atleast 14 houses had been washed away. Three piers disappeared inNorth Myrtle Beach, Cherry Grove, and Garden City.   Amy Garrison of WKZQ AM-FM said a reporter who was allowed totour the islands with civil defense personnel said houses weresitting in the middle of the road, roads were washed away and treesand power lines were down.   Refrigerators, air conditioners and washers and dryers werefloating in the streets. Stairways that lead down to the beach weresitting in the streets.   Barrier islands, which were ordered evacuated on Thursday, werepummeled and flooded. Jack Sellers, a pilot from Columbia who flewpeople to the coast to look at their property, said Pawleys Islandhad about a 100-to-200-foot wide swath cut through it.   ``There are now two Pawleys Islands, if you will,'' Sellers said.   He said two houses that had been on the beachfront were sitting300 yards or 400 yards away in a marsh.   Bush's disaster declaration makes federal aid available for suchthings as temporary housing, low-cost loans for rebuilding andgrants for repairing roads, bridges and other public structures.   Hurricane-force winds first hit the South Carolina coast at 9:15p.m. Thursday. It was the first major hurricane to strike Charlestonsince Hurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959.   The eye passed over Charleston about midnight. A wall of watergushed into City Hall when a chunk of roof on the 188-year-old brickbuilding blew away during the storm. Phone and electric service tothe city's command post was knocked out.   ``We've just been flattened,'' said Jerry Stafford, a spokesmanfor Santee Cooper Electric Co. ``One building just peeled open likea can opener.''</TEXT></DOC>
