In an article published by Resources for the Future and theNational Center for Food and Agricultural Policy, Norman J.Rosenberg also cautions against prematurely adjusting U.S.agriculture to cope with potential changes in the climate.   ``One cannot rule out the possibility that some lands now tooarid for cultivation of food crops may indeed become more usablefor these purposes in the future,'' writes Rosenberg, director ofthe climate resources program for Resources for the Future, anindependent research and education group.   ``However, there is no more evidence to support that assumptionthan there is to support the idea, popularized by the media, thatproductive lands in the U.S. Midwest and Great Plains are certainto become drier and less productive.''   Still, Rosenberg strongly suggests that some agriculturalefforts be vigorously continued as precautions against possibleproblems. He also says more research is needed to developtechniques to help farming prepare for the natural ups and downs ofclimatic variations.   ``There is nothing in the predictions of the climate changecommunity to suggest that we should reduce emphasis on soil andwater conservation programs,'' he writes.   Rosenberg was a professor of agricultural meteorology anddirector of the Center for Agricultural Meteorology and Climatologyat the University of Nebraska before joining the Washington-basedorganization last year.   ``The conservation reserve program and sodbuster provisions arelikely to be needed as much in the future as they are today,'' hewrites.   ``Conservation of groundwater should be emphasized, especiallyin aquifers, like the Ogallalla, that are only slowly rechargeable.Vast quantities of water in storage may provide a buffer to lessenthe negative impacts of greater aridity in the mid-latitudes ofNorth America, should climate change occur as some global climatemodels suggest.''   The Ogallala covers portions of Great Plains states fromNebraska to Texas and is primary source of irrigation for farming.   In an interview, Rosenberg expressed concerns that the currentdrought gripping portions of the Grain Belt has generated ``hypeand sophistry'' about the greenhouse effect _ that increasingconcentrations of carbon dioxide and other gases would cause ageneral warming of the atmosphere by trapping heat around the Earth.   Rosenberg contends the drought shouldn't be blamed on thegreenhouse effect but is a product of natural variations in weatherpatterns.   However, he says the drought should serve as a lesson for policymakers and as an indicator of the kinds of severe weather changesthat could occur more frequently in the future if the greenhouseeffect manifests itself as some have suggested.   ``I think the people who are using this year's drought as somekind of omen of the greenhouse effect are doing us a bit of adisservice ... because this drought is not at all unprecedented,''says Rosenberg. ``But the drought does drive home the point thatwe're very vulnerable and climate change can make us morevulnerable.''   Rosenberg says he is ``reasonably convinced'' that thegreenhouse effect is responsible for the gradual warming trend thathas occurred worldwide. But he says scientists lack the ability toaccurately predict the regional effects of a continuation of thatwarming. Past greenhouse effect studies have predicted widelyranging temperature and precipitation changes.   For example, a ``state-of-the-art'' study by the EnergyDepartment in 1985 projected temperature increases for the middleof North America from 2 degrees to 8 degrees Celsius, dependingupon which scientific model was used by researchers.   In his article, Rosenberg says there are indicators thatagriculture can adjust to some of the predicted climatic changes.He points to the expansion of the nation's winter-wheat growingregion since 1920.   Hard red winter wheat is grown in the northern Plains, includingMontana, where average temperatures are lower, the growing seasonshorter and there is less rainfall than traditional areas likeKansas. That expansion, Rosenberg says, ``has occurred over aclimatic gradient greater in many ways'' than the greenhousechanges predicted in some studies.   Still, Rosenberg says the current drought illustrates how modernagriculture remains extremely vulnerable to weather-relatedstresses. He contends that more emphasis should be placed onresearch to develop crops and ``techniques that minimize thatvulnerability.''   That, he says, is the best strategy for agriculture to preparefor what the greenhouse effect could bring.   ``Even if the whole greenhouse effect would turn out to be amisconception, but we had invested a lot more in research tofortify agriculture against climatic variability, naturalvariability, we'd still be coming out ahead,'' says Rosenberg.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 7</NOTE></DOC>
