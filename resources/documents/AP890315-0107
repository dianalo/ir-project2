The Philadelphia-area transit authority and its biggest unionreached the tentative agreement Tuesday, minutes before the midnightstrike deadline.   A walkout would have idled 5,200 union members who runSoutheastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority buses, trolleysand subways. SEPTA's regional rail lines would have continuedrunning with expanded routes.   ``It was a tough, tough negotiation,'' SEPTA General ManagerLouis J. Gambaccini said. ``I would like to say that the union hasbeen admirable in its seriousness in its approach and we tried torespect that.''   Roger Tauss, president of Local 234 of the Transport WorkersUnion, said he was very happy with the agreement.   Gambaccini and Tauss refused to disclose terms of the agreementuntil a union membership meeting today.   But union officials who declined to be identified said thethree-year contract calls for a 16{ percent raise. The top hourlywage is now $12.23.   The agreement also calls for a pension increase and retains thearrangement of SEPTA paying the entire cost of the workers'health-care coverage, according to sources.</TEXT></DOC>
