The remarks came in an interview of Alexei A. Obukhov, theSoviets' top arms negotiator, published today in the CommunistParty newspaper Pravda. They coincided with the first day of talksin Washington between Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.Shevardnadze and U.S. officials.   ``I have the impression that the Americans began to hesitate andare not sure now whether it is worthwhile to have an agreement onstrategic offensive arms ready by the designated date, that is bythe time Ronald Reagan visits Moscow,'' Obukhov told Pravda.``Today, the Americans are slowing down the pace rather thanincreasing it.''   Shevardnadze and U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz havebeen holding monthly meetings to work out differences in a 200-pagetreaty to cut long-range missiles by 50 percent.   President Reagan has been expected to go to Moscow later thisspring, on a date to be announced, for his fourth meeting withSoviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Both sides have said they wouldlike to sign the treaty on strategic weapons at that time.   Shultz said in Moscow last February that the two sides hadagreed to tell treaty negotiators to draft verification and otherkey elements by the time Shevardnadze came to the United States. Healso said negotiators should speed up progess in order to ensure atreaty would be ready to sign at a Moscow summit.   But Obukhov said Americans were dragging their feet with theidea of turning lack of progress against the Soviets. ``Ourpartners think that, with this kind of action, they can spoil theterm for working out the agreement and place the blame for this onus,'' he said.   Obukhov also said the Reagan administration's position on theStrategic Defense Initiative, better known as ``Star Wars,'' stillstands in the way of an agreement. The Soviets say the program todeploy a space shield against nuclear attack violates the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty between the superpowers.   In a separate dispatch, the official Tass news agency said theU.S. ``military-industrial complex'' has become wary of Star Warsbecause the program's cost may preclude spending on other types ofmilitary weapons.   ``The prospect of enormous funds being allocated for SDI at theexpense of other military programs has caused obvious concern toindividual members of the military-industrial complex, who arebeginning to see the Star Wars project as two birds in the bushthat can make them lose the bird in hand,'' Tass said.   Vladimir Chernyshov, the agency's military writer, said thefifth anniversary of the Strategic Defense Initiative is beingwidely celebrated in the United States although ``there iseffectively nothing left of the SDI `dream' as conceived five yearsago.''   ``While then they were talking about an `impregnable shield,'now they are talking about a `first phase' of an ABM system withvery limited capability,'' Chernyshov wrote.   However, he said it would be a ``dangerous illusion' to believethat because of opposition in Congress and elsewhere Star Wars willsoon be abandoned.</TEXT></DOC>
