Homac, a real estate developer, asserted that one of the three shareholders, Dallas-based DSA Financial Corp., holder of nearly 30% of Homac's 2.7 million common shares, &quot;intended to transfer its stock&quot; in Homac &quot;in violation of an agreement&quot; under which DSA was initially to offer the stock to Homac.    Mr. Neal said in a statement that Homac intended &quot;to review . . . remedies on behalf of all minority shareholders in view of the breach of (DSA's) agreement.&quot;    DSA Financial, Homac said, is a unit of Dallas-based Resource Savings, which is a major creditor of Homac and is owned by Craig Hall, a Dallas real estate investor and syndicator. Homac said that last month Mr. Hall had &quot;agreed, but then refused, to proceed with a tender offer for all of the shares&quot; of Homac.    In response to Homac's statements, Mr. Hall said: &quot;DSA and Resource honor their contracts and have done so in connection with any dealings in Homac. While we don't discuss our borrowers, I will say I'm certainly shocked by the nature&quot; of Homac's charge, &quot;which is completely without basis.&quot;    The other two holders who agreed to sell their stakes in Homac, Mr. Neal said, are a group headed by Frederic Gould that owns about 19% of Homac's common shares, and a group headed by James T. Barnes that owns about 5% of the shares. Mr. Neal said that Homac executives were surprised at receiving news of the shareholders' actions, which &quot;developed rather quickly.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
