(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Jeffrey FrentzenandM;Long-duration, uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) operate for 40 minutesor longer at full-load output.andP;  They come with power-surge and spikeprotection, connecting cables, communications connections or an RS-232Ccommunications port and sealed, no-maintenance batteries.andP;  Connection ofthese power supplies with networks is usually made with optional interfacecircuitry and cables.andP;  Power capacities are expressed in volts and amperes(VA) or kilovolts and amperes (KVA).andM;FR/UPS SeriesandM;Alpha Technologies Inc.andM;Alpha Technologies' FR/UPS line of off-line units produces sine-wave outputand uses ferroresonant circuitry to resist power overload.andP;  The units comewith four to six AC outlets, depending on the model.andM;The Alpha 1500FR has an output capacity of 1.5 KVA and comes in threeconfigurations: The 4055 ($3,960) runs at full load for 40 minutes, the 4100($4,109) for 95 minutes and the 8100 ($5,400) for four hours.andP;  Rack-mountedversions of the 1500FR measure 17 by 14 by 20 inches and cost between $2,935and $3,845.andM;The Alpha 2000FR and 3000FR models offer 2 KVA and 3 KVA output capacity,respectively.andP;  The 2000FR version 4100 ($4,769) runs at full load for 70minutes, the 8100 ($6,060) for two hours.andP;  The 3000FR version 8100 ($6,446)runs at full load for one-and-a-half hours.andM;All 4055 and 4100 cabinet models measure 20.5 by 38 by 8 inches; the 8100versions measure 20.5 by 51 by 28 inches.andM;Alpha Technologies Inc. is located at 3767 Alpha Way, Bellingham, Wash.andO;98226 (206) 647-2360.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''We were looking for a UPS that would handle everything from a networkserver to every cash register in a department store,'' said Bruce Chitiea,owner of Chi Co., a Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., computer-systems VAR and makerof CPUs for point-of-sale terminals.andP;  ''We were very impressed with Alpha'stechnology.andP;  These [UPSs] .andP;  .  .  have been hanging on phone poles for yearsand are designed to take lightning hits.''andM;Chitiea said the best feature of the Alpha UPS was also his least favorite.andO;''The transformer is very rugged -- they didn't skimp on it.andP;  But it makesnoise, and that's what I don't like.''andM;''It's an unavoidable consequence of the technology being used, as opposed tosolid-state [circuitry], which is quiet,'' he said.andP;  ''We take care of thenoise problem by shoving it under a desk.''andM;Co-Pilot 140andM;Applied Research andandM;Technology Inc.andM;The Co-Pilot 140 is an on-line power supply that measures 1.7 by 14.5 by 16inches and weighs 35 pounds.andP;  The vendor calls it a continuous parallel-powersystem (CPS) which provides as much as two hours of DC voltage directly to acomputer's AC-to-DC power supply, with an output capacity of 1.5 to 2 KVA.andO;Other features include five AC outlets and a CPS up-time display indicator.andM;It is not designed for mini or mainframe computer systems.andP;  The Co-Pilot 140retails for $1,495.andM;Applied Research and Technology Inc. is located at 5770 Powers Ferry RoadN.W., Suite 201, Atlanta, Ga.andP;  30327 (404) 951-9556 or (800) 624-4115.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''We've been real pleased with it,'' said Tansy Parr, systems analyst forSovereign Life Insurance Co., a Chubb LifeAmerica company based in SantaBarbara, Calif.andP;  Co-Pilot 140 units back up LANs in most of Sovereign's 42field offices.andM;Parr chose long-duration UPSs because of the possibility of a follow-up powerproblem.andP;  ''What can happen is that you have a power problem, the powersupply kicks in and depletes itself.andP;  And then you lose power again, and theUPS doesn't have a chance to recharge.''andM;Henry McIntosh, an independent software developer for R:base applicationsbased in Palm Beach, Fla., got more than he bargained for with the Co-Pilot140.andP;  ''I didn't necessarily want more than 40 minutes of backup.andP;  What I gotwas two hours.andP;  It looked good in the stats at the time, and I was looking atwhat running times were available for the dollar,'' he said.andM;Both Parr and McIntosh were satisfied with the company's technical support,but criticized the installation procedure.andP;  ''It's not something you can justwhip out of the box and plug into the wall,'' said McIntosh.andP;  ''The[connecting] cable is very rigid and thick, and difficult to get into theback of a computer.''andM;RM1KVA, FC7.5KVA, FC10KVA and FC15KVAandM;Best Power Technology Inc.andM;Best Power Technology's on-line units produce sine-wave output using aferroresonant transformer.andM;The RM1KVA ($2,395) is a rack-mounted model that lies in an EIA-standard19-inch relay rack.andP;  It offers 1 KVA output capacity, running up to 40minutes at full load.andP;  The FC7.5KVA ($10,125), FC10KVA ($11,575) and FC15KVA($13,945), part of Best Power's Ferrups line, measure 42 by 23 by 30 inchesand weigh, respectively, 515, 570 and 740 pounds.andP;  All prices includebatteries.andM;The RM1KVA features audible alarm sounds in Morse code, two AC outlets andfive LED display indicators.andP;  The Ferrups units come with all these features,in addition to a touch keypad with an LCD on the front panel.andM;All models come with an on-board, 8-bit microprocessor featuring an RS-232Ccommunications port.andP;
