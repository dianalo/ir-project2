This is what the president claims, of course, and many media have picked it up as standard truth. My reference book, the McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Economics, lists the longest cycle of expansion as dating from February 1961 to December 1969 -- nearly nine years. The Reagan recovery has quite a ways to go before it can claim any records. Recently, I have noted, the Journal has begun adding a qualifier -- &quot;the longest peacetime expansion.&quot; The distinction seems a bit precious. The U.S., it is true, went to war in Indochina in 1965 and the expanded defense spending helped to drive the economy. But is the Journal suggesting that something different happened in the 1980s? If one does not count the war against Nicaragua, the present era can be described as &quot;peacetime.&quot; But the economy has not been a &quot;peacetime&quot; economy -- the defense budget was doubled. Does the Journal believe this had nothing to do with sustaining the present expansion?    Bill Greider   National Editor, Rolling Stone   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
