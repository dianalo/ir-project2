Today _ oryesterday _ President Ortega now suggests that Rev. Jackson be usedas an intermediary to talk about redirecting the U.S. humanitarianaid so it can be used to demobilize the contras. What would be yourthoughts on having Rev. Jackson involved between us and Nicaragua?And are you in any way thinking of refocusing the aid from theUnited States?   A: That suggestion has limited appeal for me. (Laughter).   Q: I wonder _ I wonder if you _ it might help to enlistSecretary Gorbachev's support in encouraging reforms in some of themore reticent Eastern Europe states like _ Eastern European states_ like East Germany?   A: I want to discuss it with him. Again, I'm not suggesting,given his public statements, that he is going to be the one thatcontrols what happens, you know, in every detail in Czechoslovakiaor East Germany. But, it is a subject that we should discuss, justas I'm sure he'll want to discuss changes in this hemisphere hereor others. So, I think that will come up.   Q: Would you expect them to look favorably upon _ upon yourrequest for a little help _ a little pressure maybe?   A: A little pressure on what?   Q: Well, a little pressure on the leaders of East Germany,perhaps, to lighten up on people who want to leave.   A: Well, we'll have a chance to discuss all of those things, andthat's one of the good things about it. There will not be a certainagenda on it. We'll simply sit down and I'll give you my views onthe changes that are taking place in Eastern Europe, and certainlyI'm most interested in getting his. Yes, Frank.   Q: Mr. President, a two-part question. First of all, after youmeet Gorbachev, will you take the opportunity, since you'll be inthe region, to then meet with and brief allied leaders and solicittheir comments? And secondly, why did you hold this deliberation sotightly? You said you wanted to show the Soviet Union good faith.But why not involve the bureaucracy? Your administration, as youknow, has been criticized _   A: Because I knew exactly what I wanted to do and I knew how Iwanted to go about doing it. And that's why I didn't need to. Ididn't need the advice of others in this particular subject matter.I knew how I wanted to do it, I knew that I wanted to get thesummit, the arms control summit set. And I also knew that I wantedto _ after the discussions I told you about, to go forward withthis. And I wanted to deal in good faith with the Soviets, becauseuntil it was firmly locked, I should not be in a mode of committingthem to this kind of a meeting. And I think all that worked. And Ihope what we've done is to develop a certain confidence in theSoviets as a result of these negotiations. Confidence is important.If you're going to have frank exchanges, then you have to have acertain degree of confidentiality. But on this one, I told you whowas involved in it. I was getting good sound advice. How they gotthe information on which to advise me, why that's their business.But I felt no deprivation of being deprived from information atall. Kathy?   Q: How about the first part, though, sir? Meeting with theallies afterwards?   A: No plans to do that. This is going to be done _ if you lookat the calendar _ like over a weekend. And, of course, we'll be infull contact with them after that, but I don't plan to jump fromcountry to country after the meeting. Kathy?   Q: Mr. President, one of the Summits _ capital ``S'' _ on youragenda is the Economic Summit. Have you made a decision and arenext week's elections in Houston in any way a factor in why youhaven't announced it so far?   A: No, those elections have no relevance to the decision. Andno, the decision has not been made. Yeah?   Q: Mr. President, you say you have confidence in the Soviets.What assurances do you have that you won't be surprised bysomething Mr. Gorbachev might bring to the table? It's widelybelieved that President Reagan was somewhat sandbagged in Reykjavik.   A: He's free to bring anything he wants. There's no agenda. Butthere's _ the idea that arms control _ we might be surprised onarms control. I don't worry about that because we've got anunderstanding that the already announced summit meeting will handlethose items.   Q: Do you have any indication he has anything in particular hewants to bring?   A: I think he's anxious to do what I'm anxious to do right now,and so I don't _ I don't _   Q: Well, would you _ would you handle any arms control issue hemight raise by simply trying to defer it right at the spot?
