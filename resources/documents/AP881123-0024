It was the first time Mrs. Aquino commented publicly on theTasaday, who have become involved in international controversy sincethe government said they were discovered in 1971 in the jungles ofMindanao island.   Then-President Ferdinand Marcos declared the Tasaday, whonumbered in the dozens, an indigenous tribe and set asidetimber-rich lands for them in Mindanao.   But some Philippine scholars have branded the Tasaday a hoax thatMarcos perpetrated to gain international publicity for thePhilippines.   Defenders of the Tasaday say skeptics simply want access to richtimber lands or to discredit Marcos. But Mrs. Aquino told aninternational conference of tribal minorities that the Tasadaycontroversy underscores the need to protect primitive cultures fromexploitation.   ``For apparently materialistic motives, and to open the groups'... rich agricultural and timber ancestral lands for exploitation,some scholars with media support denounced the existence of thetribe as a hoax,'' she said.   The president said the Tasaday controversy ``was a concreteillustration of how an ethnic tribe's identity was all but lost inthe cross-currents of media hype and scholarly posturing.''   Scholars who defend the Tasaday say they are descendants ofManubo-speaking tribesmen who fled their coastal village more than700 years ago to escape pirates.   They fled into isolated jungle caves and over the centuriesreverted back to a Stone Age culture, supporters say. Others believethe Tasaday remained in isolation because they feared diseases suchas smallpox, which were rampant in coastal areas.   On Nov. 3, a congressional committee said a one-year studysubstantiated the Tasaday's claim. The 21-page report said there wasno credible evidence to substantiate claims by several professors atthe University of the Philippines that the Tasaday were a hoax.</TEXT></DOC>
