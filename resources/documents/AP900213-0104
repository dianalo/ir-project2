If that suspicion is confirmed, further work might lead to ablood test to detect people at risk for the condition, experts said.   The disorder is called malignant hyperthermia. It causessustained muscle contraction, fever and muscle destruction inreaction to commonly used inhaled general anesthetics.   While there are no good statistics on how often it occurs,estimates range from one in 10,000 administrations of anestheticsto one in 50,000, said Henry Rosenberg, chairman of theprofessional advisory council of the Malignant HyperthermiaAssociation of the United States.   Pehaps one in 10 cases leads to death, said Rosenberg, who addedthat his organization learns of about eight to 10 deaths a year inthe United States.   Malignant hyperthermia is blamed in last month's death of JudyBellomo, a member of the U.S. women's volleyball team. She diedduring surgery for thyroid cancer.   Rosenberg said such young people appear to be particularlysusceptible to the condition.   If the new research leads to a reliable blood test to detectvulnerable people, it would be an important advance, he saidMonday. The result would alert anesthesiologists not to use drugsthat cause the reaction, he said.   The current detection test is done for relatives of people withthe condition. It involves removing a piece of muscle about thelength of a middle finger, generally from the thigh, said studyco-author David MacLennan.   ``People are not very happy about having to do that,'' he said.   The test, done in the operating room, is expensive and availableonly in certain medical centers, Rosenberg said.   In the new study, scientists suggest that malignant hyperthermiacomes from a defective version of a gene that normally tells musclecells how to make a structure called the ryanodine receptor, whichplays a key role in muscle contraction.   Scientists at the University of Toronto and the Children'sHospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa studied a series of familiesin which susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia was inherited.They found that the pattern in which the susceptibility ran in thefamilies matched the inheritance pattern of the ryanodine receptorgene.   That suggests the gene is either responsible for malignanthyperthermia, or that it lies very close to the reponsible gene onthe threadlike structure called chromosome 19, MacLennan of theUniversity of Toronto said in a telephone interview.   Given the normal function of the gene, it makes ``excellentsense'' that a defective form could trigger malignant hyperthermia,he said.   Researchers still must find the defect or defects within thegene that cause the disease, he said. Then a blood test coulddetect those defects in people, he said.   The new study appears in the current issue of the Britishjournal Nature.</TEXT></DOC>
