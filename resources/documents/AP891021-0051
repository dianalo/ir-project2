The vote Friday ended a weeklong parliamentary session devotedto moving the country toward multi-party democracy, and the firstfreely contested elections since the communists consolidated powerin 1948.   The house also voted to disband the Worker's Militia,established after the 1956 revolt to protect the Communist Party.   The Communist Party itself was disbanded Oct. 7 and the newHungarian Socialist Party, which is committed to democratic ideals,took its place.   The new party, largely led by the same people who led theCommunist Party, had backed a motion to disarm the 60,000-man forcebut keep it as a civil defense organization, but this was defeated.   The house also overwhelmingly approved a proposal by housespeaker Matyas Szueros to declare Oct. 23 a day of ``nationalreconciliation.'' However, the house rejected a motion favored bythe opposition to make it a national holiday.   ``Let us be understanding of each other's differing opinions,''the statement adopted by the house on the commemoration, said.   Tens of thousands are expected to participate in a peacefulrally called by 23 opposition groups of Parliament on Monday tomark the 33rd anniversary of the revolt. In the past such rallieswere prohibited.   Csaba Vass, a member of the Socialist Party presidium, told anews conference that his party would not try to take the initiativeaway from the opposition.   In a statement the Socialist Party presidium said it ``rejects''the Soviet invasion that crushed the revolt and opposed all formsof intervention or interference in a country's sovereignty.   The house adopted two bills exonerating victims of politicaltrials and other reprisals. One bill rehabilitated those convictedof revolutionary activity after 1956 and pledged unspecifiedcompensation to victims of reprisals.   Earlier this year the government rehabilitated Imre Nagy, theleader of the uprising and several of his close associates.   A second bill also formally rehabilitated those victimizedbetween 1948 and 1962 _ the period now officially consideredHungary's Stalinist period.   Reforms enacted over the past year have put Hungary at theforefront of democratic change in Eastern Europe along with Poland_ the only country in the Soviet bloc with a non-communist-ledgovernment.   Earlier in the day the body adopted an electoral law envisaginga modified system of proportional representation meant to give allparties a chance to win mandates.   It also adopted a bill outlining plans for a presidentialelection but put off deciding on a specific date. The SocialistParty and most of the major opposition groups tentatively agreedNov. 26 would be a direct election, with subsequent presidentsappointed by Parliament.   But some opposition groups, fearing the short campaign periodwould give the Socialist Party candidate an unfair advantage,collected more than 100,000 signatures _ the amount needed to forcea plebiscite _ for a referendum on the issue. Parliament is todebate it at its next session Oct. 30.   On Thursday the house passed legislation permitting oppositionparties to operate and field candidates in the elections.</TEXT></DOC>
