The budget of the U.S. Urban Mass Transit Administration is more than $4 billion, for example, the bulk of which is totally wasted according to its administrator, Ralph Stanley, who recently startled Sen. William Proxmire (D., Wis.) by turning up in person to accept the senator's &quot;Golden Fleece Award&quot; on behalf of his agency.    But Hong Kong demonstrates that mass transit, even subways, can turn a good profit. All its transport sectors are profitable, and most are private. The bus, streetcar and ferry services are owned by private companies and receive no subsidies, although the government does build bus terminals and ferry piers for use by all companies, as well as regulating some bus routes and fares.    In addition to private buses on fixed routes, there are about 4,500 flexible-route minibuses, most individually owned. These fully deregulated minibus services have proved especially successful at serving sparsely populated districts without subsidy and acting as feeder services for the subway. All Hong Kong transport services are efficient and cheap. A trip on the Star Ferry from Kowloon to Hong Kong Island, for example, will set you back the equivalent of seven cents.    Serving the outlying areas of Hong Kong is the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corp., which is government-owned. Recently electrified and modernized, it also makes a profit. It has just begun to build a companion railroad, the Tuen Mun-Yuen Long Light Rail Transit System. Both could be privatized in the future, according to Hong Kong Commissioner for Transport, Peter Leeds.    The tunnel underneath Hong Kong Harbor is owned and operated by Cross-Harbour Tunnel Co., a private corporation in which the government has a 25% equity stake. The one-way toll for a private car is $1.30. Another private entity, the New Hong Kong Tunnel Co., composed of Hong Kong, Japanese and British companies, is currently building a second tunnel under the harbor that will accommodate both road and rail traffic. The construction is being privately financed and the tunnel also will be privately owned and managed.    &quot;Our policy is to encourage private-sector provision of as much transport infrastructure as possible,&quot; says Commissioner Leeds. &quot;It means we don't have to ask the taxpayer to put money up front to pay for many new projects.&quot;    More surprising, still, is that Hong Kong's subway makes an operating profit ($25 million in the first half of 1986), although the government has had to pay some of the initial finance and interest charges. Called the Mass Transit Railway, it consists of 22.94 miles of routes with 37 stations, and moves 1.45 million passengers per weekday. The Mass Transit Railway Corp. is established as a government-owned corporation with a mission to operate along commercial lines. &quot;Although our shareholder is the government, I regard myself as a private citizen, running a private company,&quot; stresses Eric Black, MTR's managing director.    The forceful entrepreneurial behavior characteristic of MTR would probably provoke heart attacks in most U.S. transit bureaucrats. It has launched various joint ventures with private firms to develop real estate at its stations and depots. It has, for example, roofed over its main depot and built a town for 30,000 people on top of it. &quot;This also helped by creating more customers on the doorstep of the subway,&quot; says Mr. Leeds. Some 10% of the capital cost of the subway has already been raised through real-estate development.    On top of this is the imaginative approach it takes to station use. Franchise operations have been opened in subway stations -- you can buy a pair of jeans, get your shoes repaired or deposit your laundry in most stations -- and even the operation of the ticket machines has been contracted out to the local Heng Seng Bank, which in return is allowed to operate cash machines inside the stations. The bank pays MTR about $750,000 for the privilege of issuing tickets and providing banking services. MTR no longer has the expense of issuing tickets, and also gains about $5 million a year from the float of subway fares as a direct deposit into the MTR account.    Nor are the employees allowed to run the subway for their own benefit. When a strike was launched soon after the MTR started operating, all workers were fired the next day and only some were later rehired. Despite very heavy usage the trains are clean and free of graffiti. Some might argue that it is because of Hong Kong's heavy population density that the subway is able to turn a profit. True, Hong Kong is very densely populated -- but so is New York. The New York subway once made a profit when in private hands and might do so again, were it run along Hong Kong lines. Obviously, it makes no sense to build subways in areas with low population density and little prospect of high ridership. It would be cheaper in many instances to give a free limousine to every inner-city resident than to build a mass-transit system. The private sector should be given the freedom to decide which services are profitable, and which are not.    The Hong Kong experience, especially with deregulated high-frequency minibuses, has been influential in persuading Britain to deregulate and privatize transit. After British bus services were fully deregulated last October, competing bus companies have been hustling for passengers on city streets and ridership is sharply up. When have you ever seen a public-sector bus actually looking for customers? You aren't likely to, which is precisely why the government should get out of the transportation business.    ---   Mr. Young is executive director of the Adam Smith Institute in Washington. </TEXT></DOC>
