Phillips 66 Natural Gas Co.; Complaint</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="44">May 31, 1988.</ITAG>On October 2, 1987, the Commission's Division of Producer Regulation (Staff)filed a complaint pursuant to 18 CFR 271.1105(d)(2) and Rule 206 of theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission) Rules of Practice andProcedure, 18 CFR 385.206. Staff alleges that Phillips 66 Natural Gas Company(Phillips) has calculated and received reimbursement for production-relatedcosts in excess of that permitted by andSection; 271.1104 and by the applicablegas sales contract. Specifically, Staff disputes Phillips' collection ofa contract allowance for gathering and compression calculated on totalquantities of gas delivered at the outlet of a gas processing plant inlieu of being calculated on a well-by-well basis. Staff requests the Production-RelatedCosts Board (Board) to find that Phillips' method of calculating production-relatedcosts is in violation of andSection; 271.1104 and to order refunds.Staff states that Phillips is selling gas to Panhandle Eastern Pipe LineCompany (Panhandle) under Phillips' contract No. GCF 6088 (Contract) datedMarch 6, 1979. The Contract provides that Panhandle will pay Phillips 24.0cents per Mcf, plus compressor fuel, as an allowance for gathering andcompression, for all volumes of gas delivered at either of two locations.During an audit of Phillips, Staff discovered that many wells were assigneda section 110 allowance in excess of the 24.0 cents rate permitted by thecontract. When contacted by Staff, Phillips stated that the intent of thecontract is that the 24.0 cents rate applies to total volumes delivered.Panhandle concurs with Phillips.Staff asserts thatPhillips has been collecting a price for production-relatedcosts in excess of the 24.0 cents contract rate for certain wells. In addition,Staff states that if by using the generic approach on a well-by-well basisa well is entitled to less than the 24.0 cents rate, then andSection; 271.1104permits Phillips to collect only the lesser generic rate.In support of its claim, Staff states that andSection; 271.1104(f) requiresproduction-related cost charges to be described on a well-by-well basis.Further, andSection; 271.1104(d)(1) makes it clear that the amount necessaryto recover a production-related expense is the lesser of an expressly authorizedcontract amount or the generic allowances as specified in andSection; 271.1104(d)(1)(i)-(iv).In addition, Staff claims that responses from Phillips acknowledge thatgeneric allowances in excess of 24.0 cents per Mcf had been calculatedand assigned to some wells.Staff claims that correspondence with Phillips has produced unsatisfactoryresults concerning the proper amounts which may be collected for production-relatedcosts under the contract and that Phillips has concluded that no refundsare due. Additionally, Staff states that Phillips has requested the rightto participate, with full rights as a party, in any hearing that may ariseif the matter is referred to the Board. Therefore, Staff requests the Boardto determine that Phillips is in violation of andSection; 271.1104 and issuean order requiring Phillips to refund amounts collected for production-relatedcosts in excess of that permitted by the Regulations.Under the Rules 206(b) and 213(a), 18 CFR 385.206(b) and 385.213(a), Phillipsmust file an answer to Staff's complaint with the Commission unless otherwiseordered by the Commission. Under Rule 213(e), 18 CFR 385.213(e), any personfailing to answer a complaint may be considered in default, and all relevantfacts stated in such complaint may be deemed admitted. Phillips shall fileits answer with the Commission not later than 15 days after publicationof this notice in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file aprotest or a motion to intervene with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance withRules 211 and 214, 18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214.
