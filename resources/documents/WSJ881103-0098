The study seems to be the most comprehensive analysis of pre-bid share price movement in Britain and marks the opposition party's latest criticism of the Conservative government efforts to curb insider trading. The report &quot;reveals the probability of insider trading on a massive scale,&quot; said Tony Blair, Labor spokesman on economic affairs.    A spokeswoman for the Department of Trade and Industry, which investigates charges of insider trading, defended the government's efforts. She cited the recent imposition of stiffer penalties for the crime and agreements with the U.S. and Japan to exchange information about possible insider dealing. Increasing public concern about insider trading in Britain could lead to a further crackdown.    Last month, the government announced that it would investigate possible insider dealing in Consolidated Gold Fields PLC shares in advance of Minorco SA's hostile #2.05 billion ($3.62 billion) bid in September.    The Labor Party study found extraordinary and unexplained share-price movements before Minorco announced its bid, and in 16 of 53 other big bids since the October 1987 stock market crash. Freshbake Foods PLC shares rose 26% in the three weeks before Campbell Soup Co. agreed to acquire the foods maker in June, according to the report. Abbey Life Group PLC shares fell 3% in one hour, before trading was suspended a day before Lloyds Bank PLC announced an offer to acquire a controlling stake in the insurance concern. Abbey Life shares have continued to fall since trading resumed.    Officials at the companies cited declined or couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.    Insider trading isn't the sole reason for unusual share-price movements during takeovers. For example, predators purchasing the shares of a target company in advance of a formal bid can boost the target's share price. But Mr. Blair said unusual share-price movements should be investigated more vigorously. The Labor Party's report makes &quot;a mockery of the government claims to have dealt with the problem,&quot; he said.    The Trade department spokeswoman said the government currently is investigating 16 possible cases of insider trading. The companies involved have been identified in only four cases, including the bid for Consolidated Gold. She declined to say whether the other investigations involve bids cited by the study.    Mr. Blair recommended that the government's recently established Serious Fraud Office, rather than the Trade department, investigate cases of possible insider trading. He also said the government should require earlier disclosure of price-sensitive information during the course of friendly takeover offers. </TEXT></DOC>
