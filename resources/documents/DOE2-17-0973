<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-17-0973 </DOCNO><TEXT>Goynuk and Seyitomer oil shales were pyrolysed using a Heinze retort at520 and 900 degrees C, producing high and medium oil yields, respectively.The oils derived from the kerogen were characterized using elementalanalysis i.r. and n.m.r. spectroscopy, size exclusion capillary columnchromatography and simulated distillation. The kerogen was classifiedas type I by plotting H/C and O/C atomic ratios on a van Krevelen diagram.Further confirmation was provided by the chromatographic, spectroscopicand geochemical analyses. Both oil shales are at their early stages ofmaturity. In the minimally altered oil shales, the liquid product distributionshowed significant differences compared with similarly processed asphaltitesfrom Turkey. 29 refs., 5 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
