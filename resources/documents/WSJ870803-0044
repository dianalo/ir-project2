Because the electric utility had written off $178 million in March 1986 in anticipation of the payment, the company said its July financial statements will include an extraordinary gain of about $52 million.    In a 1986 lawsuit, PS Indiana asked to be excused from any contractual obligation. The company said it plans to pay for the settlement through bank borrowings of $97 million and cash.    In Los Angeles, Unocal said in quarterly filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that proceeds from the settlement are sufficient to cover a write-down of Unocal's investment in the Sweetwater uranium facilities near Rawlins, Wyo. &quot;The impact on 1987 earnings will be insignificant,&quot; Unocal said.    Production at the Sweetwater mine started in 1981. The facility's sole customer was PS Indiana. </TEXT></DOC>
