(justifying the cost of a desktopcomputer-aided design system)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Pipes, Alan.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>It is difficult to quantify the benefits of microcomputer-basedCAD systems because few firms do a post-installation audit of thesystem, often for fear that they may find out the benefits theyexpected did not occur.andP;  Several of the benefits of desktop designsystems are discussed: increased productivity, shorter leadtimes,improved accuracy, better design quality, more accurate costcontrol, and more and better information.andP;  It has always beeneasiest to quantify productivity benefits: a typical scenariowould be to say a 10,000-pound-sterling system would need to saveseven percent of a draftsperson's time to justify its cost, whilein fact productivity improvements of three, four and even tentimes are common.andP;  Cost justification of desktop CAD systems isdiscussed.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer-Aided DesignMicrocomputersCost Benefit AnalysisEquipment AcquisitionHardware SelectionUser NeedsSoftware SelectionPlanningTutorial.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
