SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The devastating earthquake that killedhundreds in northern California vividly recalls the catastrophicquake and fire that laid waste to San Francisco in 1906.   Quakes are almost commonplace in California, with that state andwestern Nevada experiencing 90 percent of the tremors recorded inthis country according to the U.S. Geological Survey.   But when the rare major quake comes, as it did in the nation'ssecond-deadliest quake on Tuesday, serious damage can result aswell as death and injury.   And while the West Coast feels the earth shake more often,shocks can strike any part of the nation.   The new quake registered at 6.9 on the Richter scale and was onthe notorious San Andreas Fault. That reading made it thesixth-most powerful quake to strike California this century, andthe mos powerful since a 7.0 quake centered in Eureka in 1980.   Such a quake can cause severe damage, with each increase of onewhole number meaning an increase of 10 times in strength.   Tuesday's devastating quake still is well short of the 1906 SanFrancisco quake, however, which was estimated at 8.3 on the scale.That disaster killed more than 700 people, largely in fires whichswept the city in the wake of the tremor.   California and Alaska are subject to many quakes because theyrest on what is called the Ring of Fire, a region of volcanoes andearthquake-prone lands circling the Pacific Ocean.   This ring is caused by the movement of the giant plates thatunderlie the land and oceans of the earth. Plates move gradually,stresses build up over time and then are released in quakes.   San Francisco sits astride the San Andreas fault, a crack in theearth where the Pacific plate is slowly sliding north compared withthe rest of California, which rests on the North American Plate. Itwas the same fault that instigated the 1906 tremor.   While the 1906 disaster is burned into American memory, thiscountry has been relatively fortunate, compared to other nations,in terms of earthquake disasters.   The 25,000 deaths reported in Armenia a year ago are fresh inmemory, and China had an estimated 650,000 deaths in a violentquake in 1976. Japan too has suffered many deaths in historicquakes, as have Iran, Turkey, Nicaragua, Peru, Chile and othernations.   The 1906 San Francisco quake was the largest American deathtoll, although at least two other events were stronger in terms ofthe Richter scale.   Here is a rundown of other major earthquakes in American historyas recorded by the U.S. Geological Survey:   _New Madrid, Mo., was shaken by three quakes in 1811-1812estimated at 8.4 to 8.7 on the Richter scale, but damage andcasualties were light because the region had a relatively smallpopulation at the time. These quakes were felt as far away asBoston and New York.   _Prince William Sound, Alaska, was pounded by a quake rated at8.4 on the Richter scale, on March 27, 1964. In this century onlyone quake, in Chile in 1960, has been stronger. There were 131deaths and extensive damage in Alaska.   _On Nov. 18, 1867, the Virgin Islands were shaken by a magnitude7.5 quake also felt in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.Waves as large as 20 feet were generated.   _In the same area a 7.5 temblor shook the Mona passage nearPuerto Rico on Oct. 11, 1918. Some 116 people died, many in thegiant wave generated by the quake.   _On Aug. 17, 1959, a quake rated at 7.3 struck Hebgen Lake,Mont., and was felt from Seattle to North Dakota to Utah. Extensivedamage was reported and 28 people died.   _Olympia, Wash., was struck by a 7.1 quake on April 13, 1949,killing eight people and causing extensive damage in Washington andOregon.   _There was a quake rated 7.0 at Borah Peak, Idaho, on Oct. 25,1983. It was widely felt but only two people were killed.   _Coalinga, Calif., was the focus of a 6.7 magnitude quake on May2, 1983, injuring 45 people and causing $31 million in damage.   _On Aug. 31, 1886 Charleston, S.C., suffered a 6.6 magnitudequake killing 60 people. This tremor was felt as far away asBoston, Milwaukee and Havana, Cuba.   _A quake measured at 6.6 also did severe damage to the SanFernando Valley of California on Feb. 9, 1971, killing 65 people.</TEXT></DOC>
