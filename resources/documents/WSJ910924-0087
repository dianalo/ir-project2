Carroll   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/24/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A9</SO><CO>   UIS</CO><MS>TECHNOLOGY (TEC)</MS><IN>COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)</IN><NS>NEW PRODUCTS andamp; SERVICES (PDT)</NS><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)PENNSYLVANIA (PA)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   NEW YORK -- Unisys Corp. introduced a mainframe that itsays is 2 1/2 times as powerful as its previoustop-of-the-line machine and that should help it compete withthe new generation of machines from International BusinessMachines Corp.   The machine, called the 2200/900, will do especially wellfor Unisys in the fast-growing area of so-called on-linetransaction processing. Such processing has traditionallybeen done by airlines, banks and other companies with hugedatabases that must be updated instantaneously. But manycompanies are deciding they want to be able to update theircorporate databases on the fly -- rather than use thetraditional &quot;batch processing&quot; approach, in which thedatabase is updated once a day or even less frequently, astime becomes available on the mainframes.</LP><TEXT>   Still, comments that Unisys executives made at a newsconference here yesterday show how the computer anddefense-electronics concern is having to pull in its horns totry to deal with its financial problems. The executives saidthey are primarily concerned about taking care of existingcustomers, meaning they are ceding most new customers to IBMand the other companies that make IBM-compatible mainframes.   &quot;The frustration that I think a lot of people have withUnisys is that while their product line is held in very highesteem, there's a question whether they'll be able to marketit effectively,&quot; said Jim Cassell, a consultant at GartnerGroup Inc., Stamford, Conn.   He said the machine is just comparable in performance tothe new series of IBM mainframes, so customers who arenervous about Unisys's financial problems may be inclined toplay it safe and go with IBM.   The Unisys machine will come with two, three or fourcentral processors and will be available in volume in thesecond quarter. Unisys executives also said that the companywill introduce six-processor and eight-processor mainframesby the end of next year.   Unisys, Blue Bell, Pa., said the machines introducedyesterday will cost $8 million to $16 million. Those pricesrepresent a 25% reduction in the cost of a unit of computingpower when compared with the 2200/600, previously the top ofthe 2200 line.   Unisys's stock closed at $5 a share, unchanged, in latetrading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock hasrecovered a bit in recent weeks, partly on reports thatUnisys was close to selling its defense operations, whichwould help it reduce its heavy debt load.</TEXT></DOC>
