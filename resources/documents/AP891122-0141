Gorbachev.   Bush was to deliver the prime-time, Thankgiving-eve speech fromCamp David, where he is spending the holiday with his wife, Barbara.   It was the first time the presidential retreat in Maryland'sCatoctin Mountains has been used as the site for a nationallytelevised speech. Bush's remarks set the stage for talks withGorbachev Dec. 2 and 3 on warships in the Mediterranean off thecoast of Malta.   The meeting, originally billed as a relaxed, get-acquaintedsession, has been transformed into a highly charged summit by theopening of the Berlin Wall and the loosening of hard-line Communistpolicies in East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and evenBulgaria.   ``It's impossible to deny the fact that we are at a moment inhistory when many nations of the world are in transition and whendemocracy and communism are in transition,'' White House presssecretary Marlin Fitzwater said in previewing the speech.   Bush and Gorbachev have voiced hope for a calm and peacefulperiod of change in Eastern Europe and Central Europe. Bush hasemphasized that the summit is not intended to reshape the future ofEurope.   The meeting may produce a joint pledge not to interfere in thepolitical turmoil.   Bush has said he will use the meeting to promote the process ofreform and democracy. The Soviets say the meeting could produce atimetable for resolving key issues facing the two superpowers.   The president told reporters aboard Air Force One that he waslooking to the Malta summit with the ``Boy Scout motto: Beprepared.''   ``I've got a lot of homework to do,'' he said. ``We're going ina spirit of total good will. We are not going to blind-side ourallies.''   Bush said he would not have a Yalta-type meeting, ``trying todivvy up anything or decide the fate of any sovereign nation.''   ``It would be presumptuous and arrogant for the president of theUnited States _ superpower though we may be _ to try to decide thefuture of Europe in a way that would impinge on the sovereignty ofany country, east or west.''   On the eve of Bush's speech, Gorbachev said in Moscow that theSoviet Union was ``well disposed'' to the changes sweeping EasternEurope. The Soviet Union and East European countries, he said,``miscalculated'' the need for overhauling their badly strappedeconomic structures.   ``Now we have to make up for lost time and this requires a morerapid pace of change,'' Gorbachev said. He predicted the reforms``will affect everything'' in Eastern Europe and said he was infavor of ``a society that is more open to the world and is readyfor cooperation.''   Bush, before delivering his speech, made a two-hour visit toMemphis, Tenn., to salute citizens involved in volunteer andcommunity service efforts, the kind of work that he calls ``athousand points of light.''   As Bush left for Memphis, a contingent of Red Army soldierswaving American flags greeted him on the White House lawn. Bushshook hands with some of the 40 members of the Red Army Chorus,which is touring the United States and Canada.   On his return to Washington, Bush was to fly directly to CampDavid, where he will remain until Sunday.   Bush will hold pre-summit talks at Camp David with British PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher on Friday as he continues hispreparations for his first meeting with Gorbachev as president.</TEXT></DOC>
