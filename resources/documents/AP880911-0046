Peshawar in the headquarters of theanti-communist Afghan guerrilla movement.   The U.S.-backed insurgents are fighting to overthrow theSoviet-backed government of President Najib.   Rocket and other blasts have become almost daily in Kabul, theAfghan capital, since the Soviet troop withdrawal began on May 15.   Kabul authorities have blamed all of them on the insurgents, butWestern diplomats believe some bombings are part of long-standingfactional infighting between communists loyal to President Najiband a rival faction that dominates the military.   Under an agreement signed April 14, the Soviet government iswithdrawing the estimated 115,000 soldiers it had stationed inAfghanistan, leaving the fighting to Afghan government forces.   The Soviet soldiers are to be entirely withdrawn by Feb. 15.   The Soviet Union and Afghanistan have complained bitterly to theUnited Nations and to Pakistani authorities that Pakistan continuesto assist the guerrillas.
