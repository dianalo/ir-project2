Rilwanu Lukman spoke as the pricing and long-term strategycommittees of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries metfor a second day to discuss a new output ceiling for the 13-nationgroup.   Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Raheem Al-Chalabi told reporterslate Friday the ministers had broken up into informal groups to tryto work out differences.   He declined to say how the talks were progressing, although hesaid he was optimistic.   A third formal meeting of the two committees was scheduled forSaturday, OPEC sources said.   OPEC's current ceiling for 12 of it 13 member nations is 15.06million barrels a day, but the cartel's current production isestimated at close to 21 million barrels a day.   The resulting oversupply of oil on international markets sentcrude prices plummeting recently to below $12 a barrel, far belowthe official OPEC target of $18. The cartel scheduled the Madridmeetings in hopes of moving toward a new agreement that would limitoutput and stabilize prices.   Lukman, who is also Nigeria's oil minister, said, ``We have toget them (Iraqis) back into the quota fold and then we talk aboutwhether to go up or down'' on a new ceiling.   Lukman and the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia and Venezuela saythey would reject a new production pact that excludes Iraq.   Iraq has refused to abide by any OPEC-mandated production quotasince 1986, demanding it be given a quota equal to Iran's2.369-million-barrel daily limit.   Iran has rejected that condition. The two countries, who hadbeen at war since 1980, reached a cease-fire in August but remainbitter enemies.   Before the start of Thursday's meeting, Iranian Oil MinisterGholamreza Aqazadeh reiterated his country's opposition to paritywith Iraq.   Oil industry analysts say Iraq has been pumping at least 2.6million barrels of crude a day, an amount that could be pushed to3.7 million barrels a day by mid-1989 with the completion of a newpipeline through Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea.   Both Iraq and Iran, heavily dependent on crude exports forrevenue, need massive amounts of capital to rebuild theirwar-battered economies.   Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, indicated he believedIraq was willing to re-enter the OPEC quota system, but he did notsay at what production level.   OPEC Secretary General Subroto said Friday the work needed tohammer out a new agreement will require the cartel to call severalmore committee meetings before its scheduled Nov. 21 fullministerial conference in Vienna.   The OPEC pricing committee includes oil ministers from Algeria,Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Indonesia and Venezuela, while the long-termstrategy committee comprises Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia andVenezuela.   The remaining OPEC members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar andthe United Arab Emirates.</TEXT></DOC>
