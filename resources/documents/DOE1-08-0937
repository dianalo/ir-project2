Wide use of computerized control in coal preparationplants in the USSR would increase coal concentrate output by 0.5% inthe case of jigs, 0.5-2.0% in the case of flotation and 0.2-1.0% in thecase of heavy media separation. Optimization criteria in coal preparationand their effects on coal output and preparation efficiency are analyzed.Use of ash content in coal concentrate as the basic optimization criterionis recommended. If this requirement were met coal output of jigs wouldincrease by 0.85%, that of flotation would rise by 0.6% and that of heavymedia separation would increase by 0.35%.</TEXT></DOC>
