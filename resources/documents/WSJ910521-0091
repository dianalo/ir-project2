Bad weather has boosted prices for July and Octobercontracts in recent weeks, but yesterday all the New Yorkcotton futures contracts moved up sharply to new highs. Aftertrading as high as 94.25 cents a pound, cotton for Julydelivery ended 1.75 cents higher at 94.05.</LP><TEXT>   Cotton prices are within reach of the decade-old high of97.77 cents set in September 1980, said Sharon Johnson,cotton specialist at Cargill Investor Services. She declinedto predict whether prices would reach or surpass that level.The record, at least for this century, was 99 cents in 1973,according to the New York Cotton Exchange.   Adverse weather conditions persisted over the weekend inthe Mississippi Delta, where it has been too wet to plant;the Texas High Plains, where it has been too dry; andCalifornia's growing regions, where below-normal temperatureshave slowed plant growth, said Peter Leavitt, executive vicepresident of Weather Services Corp., a Bedford, Mass.,consulting concern.   Nevertheless, farmers managed to make headway in theirplantings last week, according to Martin Owens, agriculturalstatistician of the National Agricultural Statistics Service,an agency of the Department of Agriculture. In the NASS'slatest Crop Progress weekly report, released each Mondayafternoon, Louisiana cotton farmers had planted 59% of thetotal intended acreage by the end of last week, compared withjust 6% the previous week. Although the progress wassubstantial, it's still far behind the 96% planted at thistime a year ago.   Mississippi plantings also jumped, to 33% from 9% theprevious week, but are still far behind the 91% planted ayear earlier. Texas has about 36% of its acreage planted,compared with 56% a year ago. Overall, 48% of the acreage inthe 14 main cotton-growing states was planted last week, upfrom 33% a week earlier, but still below 70% in the prioryear.   The concerns of the last few weeks have centered onplanting delays causing cotton shortages from August throughOctober, the transitional months between the old and newcrops. But the price jumps yesterday in the December andlater contracts reflect concerns about the new crop ingeneral, says Ms. Johnson of Cargill. Yields could beaffected by the poor weather conditions and late start, shesaid, which has led some market players to believe the totalcrop will be smaller than the 16 million bales forecast bythe Department of Agriculture.   If cotton prices continue to rise, some mills may begin tosubstitute a greater percentage of polyester in theirfabrics, said Scott Sanford, an analyst at the AgricultureDepartment's Economic Research Service. That trend isn'tevident yet in the statistics: Cotton's share of total fibersused on cotton spinning systems rose in the first quarter to74% from 72% a year earlier. That's the highest percentage ofcotton since 1971.   But that gain may be deceptive because polyester isheavily used in production of materials such as furniture andcar upholstery, which declines in economic downturns, Mr.Sanford explains.   Besides the high price, dwindling stocks -- which areprojected to be at their lowest levels in 66 years by July 31-- may cause some substitution by mills, Mr. Sanford said.But there won't be a wholesale switch-over to polyesterbecause cotton continues to be the fiber of choice forconsumers, he added.   A continued price rise could also make it feasible formills to import cotton, as the price difference betweenforeign and domestic cotton widens to more than compensatefor transportation costs, he said. There are import quotasthat restrict the amount of cotton that can be imported toabout 125,000 bales, but imports usually run only about 2,000bales, Mr. Sanford said.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Pork futures prices fell sharply onlower cash prices and fund selling. The pork belly contractfor July delivery declined the daily limit of 2 cents apound, settling at 55.9 cents a pound. Analysts attributedthe decline to disappointment that last week's rumors of porkbelly purchases by Korea didn't pan out. The Korean rumorsfed a price rally in pork bellies last week, which taperedoff when Korea denied that it had plans to make additionalpurchases, said Jerry Abbenhaus, analyst for A.G. Edwards andamp;Sons, St. Louis. Commodity funds -- managed pools of investormoney -- were big sellers yesterday of pork belly futures. Inaddition, traders are disappointed that fresh pork belliesare still moving into cold storage, indicating anemic demandand increasing supplies of the bellies, which are used tomake bacon. Live hog futures declined 0.825 cents yesterdayto settle at 56.85 a pound, mostly because cash prices forhogs also fell.   ENERGY: Crude oil futures ended slightly higher inlethargic trading. There was little industry news to affectoil prices, and a holiday in some European countries helddown overseas trading activity. Still, on the New YorkMercantile Exchange, crude oil for June delivery broke out ofits range in late trading to close at a premium to the Julycontract for the first time in several days. The Junecontract, which expires today, settled at $21.37 a barrel, up19 cents. July crude closed eight cents higher at $21.19 abarrel. Petroleum products were mixed, with June gasolineslightly lower and June heating oil slightly higher. Tradingtoday could be affected by a pending report on the latestU.S. oil inventories. The American Petroleum Institute willrelease its weekly report after futures trading closes.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices rose. Sugar for July delivery ended0.22 cent a pound higher at 8.07 cents. Buying by investmentfunds was behind much of the initial rise, which was followedby additional buying based on technical factors, said ScottServetah, floor broker at Cargill Investor Services. But therise was muted by producer and trade selling, he added. Therewasn't any supply-and-demand reason behind yesterday's move,he said, adding that the price needed to rise above 8.59cents to break out of the current bearish trend. JudithGanes, senior soft-commodities analyst at Merrill Lynch andamp;Co., also considers yesterday's rise a &quot;temporarycorrection,&quot; and expects the price will continue itsdeclining trend.</TEXT></DOC>
