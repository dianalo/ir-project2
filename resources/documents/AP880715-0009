In a vote that had similarities to the rejection last year ofSupreme Court nominee Robert H. Bork, the Democratic-led JudiciaryCommittee voted 8-6 along party lines Thursday to recommend Senaterejection of Siegan.   The professor of constitutional law at the University of SanDiego was President Reagan's nominee for the 9th U.S. Circuit Courtof Appeals, covering nine Western states.   Like Bork, Siegan wrote often on the law, and _ like Bork _ hisviews often were contrary to precedents set by the Supreme Court,especially on civil rights and civil liberties.   But while senators decided a Supreme Court nominee deserved afull Senate vote, even Siegan's supporters said no such effortwould be made for him.   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., whose motion to report thenomination without recommendation failed on a 7-7 tie, saidafterwards that Republicans ``will make no effort to take it to thefloor. It's obvious that it's over.''   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah and another Siegan supporter, agreedthat there would be no floor fight.   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz. first voted for rejection, butthen sided with the Republican no-recommendation motion.   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who offered the motion toreject Siegan, criticized the nominee's almost total lack ofexperience before federal courts _ he had one case three decadesago _ and said the nominee practiced ``judicial activism in theextreme.''   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., agreed that Siegan's writings were``extreme'' but voted for him anyway, arguing a law professorshould have freedom to write what he chooses.   Specter, who opposed Bork, said he would be more concerned aboutSiegan's views if he were a Supreme Court nominee. An appellatecourt candidate would have no choice but to follow Supreme Courtrulings, he said _ a point Siegan made in two confirmation hearings.   Siegan wrote that prayer in schools could be constitutional,although the Supreme Court has said otherwise. He contended thatequal weight should be given to property rights and human rights.He said framers of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees basicfreedoms, never intended its scope to be as broad as that definedby the Supreme Court.   Siegan also disagreed with the high court's reasoning in its1954 decision outlawing school segregation, although he agreed withthe result.   The landmark ruling, Siegan said, should have been based on theright of black students to travel to the schools of their choice.His critics said this would have left students at the schoolhousedoor, without guaranteeing a seat inside.   Siegan, 63, was only the second judicial nominee to be rejectedby the Judiciary Committee since the Democrats regained control inJanuary 1987. Bork was the first.   Although the two men disagreed on some areas of the law, bothwrote often from their positions as law school scholars. Bork wenton to become a federal appellate judge, although he resigned afterhis defeat for the high court.   Siegan, after a state court practice, went on to become aprofessor. His lack of federal court experience was cited byDemocrats opposing him.   ``He hasn't handled a case since I was 12 years old _ 36 yearsago,'' said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction overAlaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada,Oregon, Washington, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.</TEXT></DOC>
