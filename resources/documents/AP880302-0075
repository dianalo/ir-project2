Edward Margrabia, 69, died Tuesday of multiple trauma atPembroke Pines Hospital.   ``He was just crushed, his kidneys and everything. Oh, I tellyou, it was awful,'' said neighbor Ann Adelson. ``Poor man. He's aterrific guy. He helps everybody in the neighborhood.''   Chris McCauley, whose home is behind Margrabia's, said she heardthe wall collapse as she fixed sandwiches for lunch.   ``I just heard a sound like cement blocks hitting the ground ...I thought it was strange to hear a noise and see nobody there,''she said. When she realized what had happened, she roused otherneighbors to help extricate Margrabia.   ``By the time we had eight people there, we were trying to prythe wall up with pieces of wood. And as we were trying, the wallbroke _ right on his back,'' Ms. McCauley said.   When police arrived to free Margrabia with a hydraulic jack, hewas unconscious, police spokesman Ed Plaisted said.
