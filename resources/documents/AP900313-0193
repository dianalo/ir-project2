Somefear the new democracy will not survive.   Political parties fight pitched battles in the crampedalleyways; 60 people were killed and hundreds wounded Feb. 7.Paramilitary forces still patrol Karachi and a curfew continues insome districts.   The universities are closed and gangs of student extremists haveturned them into armed camps. Kidnappings and torture arecommonplace.   Unemployment is rampant. Government officials say they have noway to count the people looking for work.   A gram of heroin costs less than $2. A decade ago the drug washardly found in Pakistan. Now Karachi has 300,000 addicts,one-third of the nation's total.   Automatic weapons used to be rare in Karachi; today you can renta Kalashnikov assault rifle for $5 a day. Bands of robbers roam thecountryside and car thieves operate throughout the city.   Many residents say the police are either corrupt or incompetent.Police say they are outnumbered and outgunned wih one officer to458 citizens, one of the lowest ratios in South Asia.   ``Karachi, once a city of peace, tranquility and affluence, hasturned almost into Beirut,'' Mahmood Ali Malik, a notedpsychologist, wrote in The Pakistan Times.   ``The army is certainly waiting in the wings,'' said Ahmed AliKhan, editor of the Dawn, the largest English-language newspaper.``Increased chaos could threaten our democracy.''   Eleven years of martial law ended two years ago after Gen.Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, the president, was killed in a plane crash.Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, elected in November 1988, presidesover a shaky government.   Any problem Pakistan has, Karachi appears to have in greatermeasure. Because of its size and importance, Karachi's problemshave national scope.   Eight million people live in the city, which sprawls on thesun-baked coast of the Arabian Sea. It is Pakistan's economiccenter and the only major port.   Three layers of interwoven troubles weigh on the city and therest of Sind province, which surrounds Karachi: ethnic strife,social breakdown and a newer phenonmenon called ``the heroin andKalashnikov culture.''   Guns have been plentiful in Pakistan ever since Soviet militaryforces entered Afghanistan in December 1978 and the U.S.-supportedAfghan rebels moved their bases to Pakistan.   Millions of dollars in U.S. aid to the rebels helped finance ahuge arms trade in northern Pakistan. Simultaneously, the making ofheroin became an important source of income for Afghan refugees andindigenous tribes in the area.   Weapons accompanied the narcotics south to Karachi, a mainconduit for heroin to Western Europe and the United States. About6,000 pounds of heroin were seized in Karachi in the last half of1989, more than double the total for 1986 and 10 times the amountsof earlier years.   Shootings of law enforcement officers are frequent. A rankingcustoms agent was shot six times in the face and leg as he left hishome last June on what was to be a secret raid. He survived.   Drugs and guns in the city combine with increasing crime in thesurrounding countryside. Disputes formerly resolved by a villageheadman now are settled with guns, historian Hamida Khoura said.   ``We face an institutional breakdown throughout the province,''said Fakhruddin Ibrahim, governor of Sind province. ``Chaos isruling,'' and police can do little to stop it.   ``The police in Pakistan have always been a political tool,'' hesaid in an interview. ``Years of martial law taught them that. Idon't see it changing.''   Add ethnic strife and the situation becomes increasinglyvolatile.   Ever since the subcontinent was divided into India and Pakistanin 1947, at the end of British colonial rule, Karachi has beenPakistan's closest thing to a melting pot.   Pathans and Punjabis moved south to make a fast rupee in theport city. Sindhis came from the countryside to sell their produce.Immigrants called Mohajirs, flooded into Moslem Pakistan frompredominantly Hindu India.   Nothing melted in the pot, however, and trouble between rivalethnic groups began in the 1950s.   Ethnic strife acquired political overtones in 1985 withformation of the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, which sought to representthe interests of immigrants from India.   Mohajirs say they are discriminated against by the provincialgovernment, which Sindhis dominate. They want more jobs andofficial recognition of their ethnic group.   Their movement has become an important political force becauseMohajirs are more numerous than any other group in the cities ofSind province, including Karachi.   Altaf Hussain leads the movement. The former pharmacy student,known for strirring speeches, ever-present sunglasses and opulentlyringed fingers, has adopted ``Sell your TV and buy a gun!'' as hisbattle cry.   ``We are a new phenonmenon, a party of destiny,'' Hussain saidin an interview. ``We are the first party to represent theoppressed and suppressed masses. I am the chosen leader.''   Karachi politics went national when Hussain united with thenational opposition in an attempt to bring down the Bhuttogovernment.   Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party, based in Sind, had analliance with Hussain during the campaign but tended to ignoreMohajir interests after winning the election.   In November, she barely defeated a no-confidence vote in theNational Assembly when the 14 members from the Mohajir movementvoted against her.   On Feb. 7, Hussain called for a general strike in Karachi toprotest what he described as persecution by her party. Scores ofpeople were killed in clashes between police and gunmen of bothparties.   More than 200 kidnappings were reported. Victims were torturedwith electric drills, castration and multiple cigarette burns.   On March 2, talks began between Hussain's group and the Bhuttoparty.   ``We all realize that things have gotten as bad as they canget,'' said Nafees Siddiqi, a top official of the Pakistan People'sParty in Sind. ``If things get worse, the army could roll back in.''   Structural problems stand in the way of political peace.   Pakistan has been under martial law for 20 of the last 30 yearsand now has an extremely centralized system. Many observers sayviolent politics will continue until some authority devolves tocities and provinces.   ``Now everybody can be an extremist because none of them hasreal authority,'' said Ibrahim, the provincial governor. ``Givethem a budget and they'll become moderates.''   Ansar Burney, who fights for prisoner rights and against drugabuse in Karachi, says few residents have the national interest atheart.   ``No one in Karachi thinks about the public good,'' he said.``They're just obsessed with power and guns.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 18</NOTE></DOC>
