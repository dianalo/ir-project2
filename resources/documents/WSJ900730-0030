The board plans to file a petition today requesting thestate Public Service Commission cut New York Telephone ratesby $31 million in addition to the $290 million rate reductionand $164 million refund it proposed two weeks ago. New YorkTelephone has asked the PSC for a $1.4 billion rate increaseover three years.</LP><TEXT>   Richard Kessel, executive director of the ConsumerProtection Board, said the $31 million was not a finalnumber, but rather a &quot;marker&quot; in the current rate case. Thefinal rollback, he said, could amount to much more. Mr.Kessel said there wasn't enough time in the nine-month ratecase to fully investigate Materiel Enterprises Co. &quot;If weleave it in the rate case, we won't be able to give it theattention it needs,&quot; he said.   New York Telephone had no immediate reaction to theConsumer Protection Board proposal, but a spokesman said thecompany has been trying to keep the focus on the &quot;criticalfinancial issues.&quot; The orderly process initially set up bythe PSC, he said, &quot;has become sidetracked so much by what isgoing on outside the hearing room.&quot; Hearings in the rate casebegin today.   The rate case has unearthed alleged misconduct at annualconventions for suppliers. Women allegedly were hired forentertainment and sex at the conventions, which wereorganized by a top executive in the purchasing unit who wasfired by the company in 1988. Nynex, which investigated thematter in 1988 and dismissed two employees and disciplinedseven others, has said that employees who attended did so attheir own expense and on their own time. However, rate-casedocuments indicate some Nynex attendees did not take vacationtime and that suppliers may have picked up hotel room tabs.   The New York attorney general's office, a party to the NewYork rate case, said it &quot;completely supports&quot; the idea ofseparating the Materiel Enterprises investigation from therate case, but said the initial $31 million rate cut was fartoo little. Charlie Donaldson, a lawyer in the attorneygeneral's office, said that the only full operations audit todate -- examining contracts for equipment removals fromtelephone central offices -- found $20.9 million in overpayments on $22.4 million of charges.</TEXT></DOC>
