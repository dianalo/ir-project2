Mr. Chung said Korea's foreign assets are expected to rise to $23.5 billion in 1992 from $13.4 billion this year, while its external debts are expected to fall to $19 billion from $35.5 billion. Despite growing foreign protectionism, he said, Korea will be able to register current-account surpluses of $5 billion annually over the next five years. The current account measures trade in goods and services, as well as some unilateral transfers; this year's surplus is expected to reach about $9 billion.    The government uses funds from the surplus to repay foreign debts and to invest abroad, partly in an effort to avoid trade frictions with other nations.    Mr. Chung said Korean exports are expected to soar from this year's projected $46 billion, to $76 billion in 1992. Over the past eight years, the minister said, Korea's annual economic output has doubled, to $120 billion, with exports nearly tripling, to $46 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
