The results obtained wereto give an indication of the susceptibility of (C/sub 6/H/sub 3/Cl/sub2/)OCH/sub 2/CH/sub 2/N/sup +R//sub 2/CH/sub 2/CH/sub 2/P(OR')O/sub 2/-to analogous fragmentation to release 2-(3,4-dichlorophenoxy)ethyldialkylamineand ethylene, both well documented plant growth regulating hormones.Since the trimethylammonioethyl-substituted species was found to be stableto fragmentation, studies were embarked upon to convert this moleculeinto one which would react as required. Attempts at its synthesis weremade by various approaches. Attempts at the synthesis of diethyl 2-iodopentylphosphonateand diethyl 2-bromopentylphosphonate by various means are described,but no satisfactory syntheses have been achieved, since once again thedehydrohalogenation product predominates. During an attempted synthesisof diethyl 2-iodopentylphosphonate by reaction of diethyl 2-chloropentylphosphonatewith NaI, an unusual interaction between the sodium cation and the substratein acetone solution was discovered. Evidence gleaned from /sup 1/H, /sup13/C and /sup 31/P nmr experiments points to the formation of a loosecomplex between the phosphonate part of the substrate and Na/sup +/.This phenomenon is also observed when other salts such as CaI/sub 2/,KSCN and NaClO/sub 4/ are present in solution.</TEXT></DOC>
