The civic opposition now ``is more united, more cohesive and moremonolithic,'' Erick Ramirez of the Social Christian Party said atthe meeting Sunday. It will beat the Sandinistas in electionsscheduled for 1990 ``with votes, not bullets.''   Hernaldo Zuniga of the Conservative Democratic Party said that``Sandinista (government) efforts to divide the opposition'' havefailed. ``The Sandinista ideology and its political and economicprogram are the biggest failure in the history of the country.''   Police patrolled the area during the meeting of about 3,000people. No violence was reported.   The alliance is made up of 14 divergent groups, including SocialChristians, Liberals, Conservatives, Communists, Socialists, SocialDemocrats, Central American Unionist parties, and the WorkersPermanent Congress. It was formed after a dialogue between thegovernment and opposition reached an impasse last December.   The dialogue was initiated after Central American nations inAugust 1987 signed regional accords that called for national peacedialogues in the embattled region.   The Sandinistas, who came to power through a revolution in 1979,have been challenged by U.S.-backed rebels in an eight-year civilwar that has taken more than 50,000 lives. Most of the fightingstopped when a cease-fire was declared in March.   Mauricio Diaz, secretary general of the Popular Social ChristianParty, said that the Sandinista government increased its repressionin 1988, forcing thousands of Nicaraguans to flee to other countries.</TEXT></DOC>
