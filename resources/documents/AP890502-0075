The South African Broadcasting Corp. commentary also divergedfrom previous government statements by depicting the Soviet Union'spresence in Southern Africa as legitimate and permanent.   It was one of the most explicit expressions of a major newdevelopment in South African foreign policy, triggered by thediplomatic initiatives of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Gorbachev's tactics have forced Pretoria to revise itsdecades-old view of Moscow as an arch enemy orchestrating blacknationalist guerrillas in a ``total onslaught'' to overthrow SouthAfrica's white-dominated government.   In recent months, the two countries have found a common interestin seeking to keep an independence plan for Namibia on track. SouthAfrican officials also have been pleased by Soviet statements thatMoscow seeks peaceful change in South Africa.   ``The Soviet Union appears to have accepted that South Africa isthe regional power in Southern Africa,'' the radio said. ``SouthAfrica, for her part, must accept that although Southern Africa isnot a traditional sphere of influence for the Soviet Union, she hasbeen allowed by other governments in the region to establish apresence that is a permanent presence.''   Because of this, the commentary said, ``a certain degree ofinteraction is consequently inevitable and, in certain areas, couldbe fruitful.''   ``Trade relations with Eastern Bloc nations can be expandedwithout South Africa diluting her firm and longstanding resistanceto the inhumanity of communism,'' it said. ``Diversified tradingrelations are all the more important given the hostile action ofWestern nations such as the United States in instituting economicsanctions.''   Last week, there was an official Soviet visit to South Africafor the first time since the countries broke diplomatic ties in1956. Soviet diplomat Viacheslav Ustinov came to Cape Town withU.S., Angolan and Cuban officials to assess accords calling forSouth Africa to end its rule of Namibia and Cuba to withdraw troopsfrom Angola.   Ustinov emphasized that Moscow will not consider restoringrelations with Pretoria until it dismantles its policy of legalrace discrimination and grants political rights to the blackmajority.   The radio said: ``As a Christian nation, South Africa, in turn,must condemn the oppression of religious and ethnic minoritiesunder the communist system ...   ``This having been said,'' it added, ``there are certainrealities that have to be taken into account.''</TEXT></DOC>
