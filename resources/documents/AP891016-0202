Its curriculum is all about crime and itsstudents are very aware that the content is lethal. Welcome to theJohn Jay College of Criminal Justice.</TEXT><TEXT>   By KAY BARTLETT=AP Newsfeatures Writer=   NEW YORK (AP) _ John Salamy, a 22-year-old aspiring FBI agent,was a bit disconcerted when he looked down during an exam and saw a.38-caliber revolver strapped to the ankle of the student next tohim.   On this campus, you may smoke only in designated areas. You maycarry your gun anywhere.   The John Jay College of Criminal Justice, part of the CityUniversity of New York system, is indeed an unusual institution ofhigher learning.   It is a liberal arts college where you cannot major in English,history or philosophy, but you can major in forensic psychology,criminology or deviant behavior and social control.   A science lab is equipped to do DNA testing, the ultimate inidentification. Kojak is now filming in the environs. A vintagefiretruck, enclosed in glass, is the major artwork of one building.   ``It's the only school where you might have an ex-felon, arecovering alcoholic, an FBI man and a cop all taking notes in thesame class,'' says Dr. Charles Bahn, a psychology professor.   ``In fact, we used to joke back when it was nearly all cops,`How do you grade a class where everybody is armed?' We told themwe gave credit for time served and were open to plea bargaining.''   John Jay is one of only a few colleges of criminal justice,including those at the universities of Chicago, Nebraska at Omaha,Wisconsin, Louisville, Baltimore and East Tennessee State.   Soon to celebrate its 25th anniversary, John Jay is still calledthe ``cop school,'' but it has expanded its horizons since it washoused in the Police Academy and all the students were New York'sfinest.   In the ensuing years, the college moved to several differentlocations in Manhattan, but up until the 1970s about 70 percent ofits students were police officers.   Now housed in two buildings near Lincoln Center, and just southof a housing project, the student body is predominantly civilian,with only a quarter of them cops or others in uniformed services.   Still, the coffee shop-deli down the street would not make theday of an armed robber. There is a lot of firepower beyond thosepastrami and corned beef sandwiches.   There are more than 8,000 students, most of them pursuingassociate and bachelor's degrees. In addition, 550 are working fortheir masters and 103 their doctorate.   John Jay, named after the first U.S. Chief Justice, has aspecial mission within the CUNY system, the largest urbanuniversity in the country with 19 schools and 194,000 students.Says Jay's president, Gerald Lynch:   ``We hope John Jay will help professionalize the criminaljustice system, teach people in law enforcement that life isambiguous, that life is made up of grays, that it will give themmore compassion.   ``We don't teach fingerprinting here. We have a library, which Iinsisted be the first thing people see when they enter the newbuilding. We have a 625-seat theater.   ``The students learn things here they will use outside of theirprofessional life, things to enrich their personal life.''   Students often complain about the liberal arts courses, sincemany have already decided on a career. Salamy, for example, wantsto become either an FBI man or a DEA agent.   Despite the similarity of interest, there is great diversity.   ``Students here want to be anything from probation officers tojudges to senators,'' says Julia Bryant, a school spokeswoman.``There are 19-year-olds who want to be on `21 Jump Street' andolder cops who want to be commissioner.''   There are also indications that some of the police students arepreparing for a second career. Security management is anincreasingly popular major.   ``Maybe the biggest thrill of going to John Jay is knowing youare going to have a job when you get out,'' says Dr. LawrenceKobilinsky, who is a recognized DNA-fingerprinting expert.   Graduates are heavily recruited by would-be employers, includinglaw enforcement agencies. The Rochester, N.Y., Police Departmentset up a recruitment table early this semester.   The school's alumni include two dozen to three dozen policechiefs across the country.   The Criminal Justice Center housed at Jay is sort of an advancedcop school, but students don't take formal courses. It offersworkshops and seminars on such things as hostage negotiation,stakeout and surveillance techniques, confidential informants,clandestine drug labs, bomb awareness. The classroom is often thestreet.   These specials, usually given for law enforcement agencies butoccasionally for private industry, are not open for publicinspection. They don't want to give away secrets of the sleuthingtrade.   ``The mutts don't know these things,'' said one of the 35 NewYork City housing cops who attended a five-day workshop onnarcotics investigation.   The workshop was conducted by Lt. Frank Bunting, division chiefof a drug enforcement task force that includes federal, state andcity agents.   Bunting presented the latest technology and offered advicegrowing out of his own experience. In discussing surveillance hetalked of ``ghosts'' and ``uncles'' and other undercover operatives.   The students role-play a drug bust, and sometimes they makemistakes. In one, the major suspect simply strolls out of the room,while the ``arresting officers'' question the lesser crooks.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
