The company said it has decided to take its FoxMeyer Drugunit, the nation's third-largest drug distributor, off themarket and operate it as its sole unit. As for the BenFranklin variety and craft store business, NationalIntergroup said it would consider creating a separatelytraded company through a tax-free spinoff of shares in thechain to shareholders. National Intergroup also said it wasdiscussing buyout offers for its crude oil distributioncompany, Permian Partners.</LP><TEXT>   In related moves, National Intergroup named a new chiefexecutive and revamped its board. Robert L. King, who hadbeen president of FoxMeyer, was named president and chiefexecutive officer. He succeeds longtime National Intergroupexecutive Howard M. Love as chief executive, and James S.Pasman Jr. as president, whose retirements both had beenexpected.   Abbey J. Butler and Melvyn J. Estrin were namedco-chairmen, succeeding Buck Mickel, who was elected chairmanin August. Messrs. Butler and Estrin are principals ofCentaur Partners, an investment group that effectively oustedmanagement and took control of the company last August.   Since that time, National Intergroup essentially has beenon the block. It has talked to prospective FoxMeyer buyers,including Bergen Brunswig Corp., but wasn't satisfied withany bids. Centaur Partners estimated that FoxMeyer couldfetch between $475 million and $525 million, or at least $21per National Intergroup share.   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchangeyesterday, National Intergroup shares closed at $15.375, down50 cents.   The company said the bids for FoxMeyer didn't &quot;reflect theoperating potential of the company or the significantpositive developments&quot; at FoxMeyer and in the industry.FoxMeyer has benefited from higher volume from chain storeaccounts and stronger institutional sales, as well as bettercost control. The unit's sales in the third quarter endedDec. 31, 1990, increased 21% to $733.6 million fromyearearlier figures, while operating income increased 71% to$12 million.   &quot;The outlook for the wholesale drug industry and FoxMeyeris very optimistic. Pharmaceutical usage continues to expand,as does the value of the services provided by wholesalers,&quot;said Mr. King.   Gregory Drahuschak, an analyst with Butcher andamp; Singer, inPittsburgh, said he thinks the company wanted about 25% morefor FoxMeyer than the market was willing to pay. Moredisappointing, he said, was the company's inability to sellBen Franklin outright and use the cash to reduce debt.   Still, he said, the moves to remove the Ben Franklin andPermian operations will enable National Intergroup toconcentrate on the drug distribution business. &quot;At least nowthey can focus on what they really ought to be doing,&quot; hesaid.   National Intergroup said headquarters would be moved toFoxMeyer's existing headquarters in Carrollton, Texas. Thecompany will retain for now its 30% ownership in NationalSteel Corp., which is majority owned by NKK Corp. of Japan.   National's board also was reduced to nine from 12, withfour new members: Alfred H. Kingon, president of KingonInternational; Sheldon W. Fantle, chairman and chiefexecutive of Fantle Enterprises, Inc.; Charles P. Abod,president of Human Service Group, Inc.; and Paul M. Finfer,president and chief executive of Franklin Investment HoldingsInc.</TEXT></DOC>
