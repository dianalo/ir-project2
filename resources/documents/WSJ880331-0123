Stertz (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> AUT </IN><G> TRN </G><DATELINE> TROY, Mich.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Audi of America Inc. released documents showing it has received 396 complaints of sudden, unintended acceleration on cars equipped with automatic transmission shift locks, a device touted as a cure-all for runaway cars.    But Audi officials insisted the device works, saying only 15 complaints involved shift lock failure. Audi, whose parent is Volkswagen AG's Volkswagen of America Inc., attributed most of those failures to improper dealer installation.    Consumer groups questioned Audi's explanation. &quot;The fact that there are so many complaints involving Audi 5000s that now have shift locks proves the problem is not solved,&quot; said Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Washingon, D.C.-based Center for Auto Safety.    Audi released the reports to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after Democratic Rep. George Hochbruecker of New York earlier this month accused the agency of letting Audi withhold information on shift lock failure from the public.    Audi began installing shift locks on its 5000 models in September 1986 as a way to prevent sudden acceleration. The West German luxury car maker later agreed to a shift lock recall on 5000 models built between 1978 and 1986. The devices are standard on 1987 and 1988 Audi 5000s. Audi and other auto makers maintain the shift lock prevents sudden acceleration by forcing the driver to depress the brake before putting the car in gear.    According to the 60-page Audi report, the 396 complaints came from more than 170,000 cars fitted with a shift lock in the recall.    Audi said problems such as skidding on slick pavement or erroneous gear selection -- not shift lock failure -- caused 183 cases. Engines that unexpectedly rev up while idling -- causing drivers to step on the gas in panic -- caused another 109 cases, Audi said. Another seven cases involved cars that ran out of control when shifted from neutral into gear, Audi said. Shift locks only work when the car is in park.    Fifteen of the complaints were blamed on failure of the shift lock because of improper installation; one complaint was blamed on cruise control failure; and the rest covered a variety of malfunctions, Audi said. The car company said it is still investigating 65 complaints. </TEXT></DOC>
