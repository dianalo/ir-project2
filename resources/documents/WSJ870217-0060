He's talking about the hair-trigger currency markets. Almost every time Mr. Baker says something about the dollar, currency traders jump to push exchange rates up or down. With news tickers humming, and currency-trading desks open somewhere in the world around the clock, the dollar is a sitting duck.    And these days, no matter what Mr. Baker says, the dollar seems to fall, because currency dealers read into his remarks a lack of U.S. resolve to defend its currency. Given the market's current bearish sentiment against the dollar, it may be impossible for the U.S. to arrest the slide with talk alone -- and Mr. Baker hasn't tried. Nor, he says, has he tried to jawbone the dollar down, though that's how the markets interpret nearly everything he says.    Take the morning of Feb. 9. Mr. Baker, appearing on NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show, was asked if finance ministers of the U.S. and its major economic allies would meet soon to discuss the dollar and global trade imbalances. &quot;Well, there's no such meeting scheduled as we sit here this morning,&quot; Mr. Baker replied.    To Baker-watchers in Washington, the secretary's remarks were clear: The phrase &quot;as we sit here this morning&quot; was intended to hint that while the ministers hadn't set a meeting-date yet, there was a good possibility they might agree on one soon. But the markets concluded there wouldn't be a meeting, and the dollar fell sharply.    Last Tuesday, at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Baker assiduously tried to avoid setting off a further slide in the dollar. He said flatly he wasn't trying to &quot;talk the dollar down.&quot; He noted that the U.S. currency already had dropped sharply against the Japanese yen. And he warned that if the dollar declined too fast, there was a danger of rekindling inflation, making it difficult to attract needed foreign capital. Perhaps to reassure lawmakers, the Treasury chief added that he still saw &quot;no evidence&quot; that these adverse consequences were occurring.    The markets read these remarks to mean there was room for the dollar to fall further, which is exactly what it did.    Part of the problem is that treasury secretaries, finance ministers and central bankers often speak with more finesse than force. This can leave room for misinterpretation.    Mr. Baker's basic position is this:    --The U.S. wants to reduce its trade deficit, and wants West Germany and Japan to cut back their corresponding trade surpluses. The U.S. led a five-country attempt to drive down the value of the dollar starting in September 1985, but it's clear that a dollar decline alone won't accomplish the job. West Germany and Japan also must spur domestic demand so they can absorb a larger share of the world's exports. And Washington must cut the federal budget deficit more rapidly. But so far, all three haven't budged.    --Until there is progress in coordinating economic policies, Washington has been content to allow the dollar to decline gradually. But there isn't any evidence the administration has deliberately tried to talk the dollar down in recent months.    --In the past few weeks, Mr. Baker and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker have become increasingly concerned that the dollar may be dropping too far, too fast. A rapid collapse of the dollar could be self-defeating because it could squeeze West German and Japanese exports, thwarting hopes of getting them to grow faster and absorb more imports.    --The U.S. is pushing anew to get both those countries to stimulate demand at home, offering in return to cooperate in stabilizing the dollar. One possibility is to have the five largest developed countries agree on upper and lower limits for the dollar, the German mark and the Japanese yen, and vow to intervene to defend them, changing economic policies if necessary. In the meantime, Washington wouldn't mind at least a temporary pause in the dollar's decline.    But for now, Mr. Baker is wary of saying much about the dollar's daily movements or where he would like the dollar to be in relation to other currencies. &quot;I'm constrained to refuse to comment on exchange-rate relationships,&quot; he told a congressional committee in June, &quot;unless there is a specific reason to do so.&quot;    Yet even his refusal to comment can move the dollar. The markets have interpreted Mr. Baker's insistence that the administration &quot;has no target&quot; for the dollar to mean that he wants the greenback to fall further. Actually, Mr. Baker contends, he means no such thing.    And when the New York Times reported in January that the administration had &quot;let it be known&quot; that it wanted the dollar to decline, officials felt they couldn't respond for fear of sending the greenback into a free-fall. The truth was that the administration's policy hadn't changed: It was content, as before, to let the dollar waft further, but officials insist they weren't trying to speed the decline.    ---   Dollar Mixed in Quiet Day   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup   The dollar was narrowly mixed yesterday in trading muted by the absence of U.S. market participants because of the George Washington's Birthday holiday.    &quot;The market has been very, very dead,&quot; said Peter J. Becket, chief foreign-exchange dealer at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, London.    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks in a television interview early yesterday morning had no impact on overseas currency trading. On the CBS &quot;Nightwatch&quot; program, Mr. Baker repeated his oft-stated view that foreign-exchange rates should be determined by &quot;the market&quot; and that the dollar's decline so far &quot;doesn't constitute a free fall.&quot;    In late London trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8210 West German marks, up slightly from 1.8175 in late New York dealings Friday. The U.S. unit eased to 153.55 Japanese yen, from 153.60.    ---                       CURRENCY RATES                          London    Home Mkt.    New York                           Mon.
