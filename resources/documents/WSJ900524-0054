But the U.S. participants, Boeing Co. and McDonnellDouglas Corp., said the group members won't share proprietarydata or technology. &quot;This is just a loose, ad hoc agreementto discuss the ramifications of a new generation plane,&quot; saida spokesman at Seattle-based Boeing.</LP><TEXT>   Two of the group participants, Aerospatiale of France andBritish Aerospace PLC, whose predecessors built thesupersonic Concorde, recently teamed up to build a successorto that plane that presumably would include technologytransfer. The fifth study group member is Deutsche AirbusG.m.b.H. of West Germany.   &quot;The intent {of the study group} is to see what theworld-wide needs might be after the year 2000 and how thesefit with the commercial fleet that would be operating then,&quot;said Don Graf, manager of St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas'shigh-speed transport group. &quot;Nothing unique to a particularairplane&quot; would be part of the one-year study, he said.   Mr. Graf said the group also would consider suchenvironmental concerns as how engine emissions might affectthe atmosphere and noise pollution caused by sonic booms.McDonnell Douglas, Boeing and the other participants willcontinue their individual research, he said. But he didn'trule out the possibility that the study might lead toeventual joint cooperation among some or all of the companiesto build the next Concorde.   Analysts on both sides of the Atlantic were skeptical thatany international consortium would be forged at the end ofthe one-year study, or that a new supersonic craft would getoff the ground anytime in the next decade. Environmentalrestrictions have toughened, and fuel prices and capitalcosts have risen since plans for a U.S. supersonic aircraftwere scrapped in the early 1970s.   The new study group &quot;is a great opportunity to listen towhat your toughest competitors think,&quot; said Howard Rubel atC.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. &quot;I seriously doubt thatthere will be an economically-viable project,&quot; in the next 10to 15 years, said Paul Nisbet at Prudential-Bache SecuritiesInc.   None of the U.S. or European aircraft makers is likely totry building a new supersonic aircraft without heftysubsidies from their respective governments -- and governmentmoney will be scarce. Announcement of the study may signalthe start of an industry lobbying campaign for cash inWashington, Paris, Bonn and London, some European analystssaid.   The lobbying will be difficult. For the forseeable future,Bonn will be too preoccupied by the costs of Germanunification. And British government officials grumble thatthe first-generation supersonic airline, Concorde, hasn'tbeen a financial success. U.S. budget makers are trying topare a ballooning deficit. Only the French government, whichheavily subsidizes aerospace research, is a likely source ofsupport for the consortium.   ---   Richard L. Hudson in London contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
