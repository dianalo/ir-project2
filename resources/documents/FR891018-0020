Historically,<T3>Harrisia portoricensis</T3> was known from the off-shore islands ofMona, Monito, and Desecheo and one area on mainland Puerto Rico. Deforestationfor industrial and urban development has extirpated the species from themainland. This endemic cactus is threatened by potential development projectson Mona Island and by impacts to vegetation from feral goats and pigs.This proposal, if made final, would implement the Federal protection andrecovery provisions afforded by the Act for <T3>Harrisia portoricensis</T3>.

However, urban, industrial, and agricultural expansionhas resulted in the elimination of this population. Today it is known onlyfrom three small islands off the west coast of Puerto Rico: Mona, Monitoand Desecheo.This endemic cactus was placed in the genus <T3>Harrisia</T3> together with species from other Caribbean Islands andFlorida by Britton in 1908 (Bull. Torr. Club 35:561). In 1910 Weingarttransferred members of this genus to <T3>Cereus</T3> along with other columnar cacti (<T3>In</T3> Urban, Symbolae Antillanae 4:430). However, the treatment of<T3>Harrisia</T3> as distinct prevailed until recently when the groupingof columnar cacti into the genus <T3>Cereus</T3> once again began to gain acceptance (Vivaldi and Woodbury1981). Liogier and Martorell (1982) in their flora of Puerto Rico and adjacentislands retain the taxon as a species in the genus <T3>Harrisia, </T3>and it has been treated as such here.<T3>Harrisia portoricensis</T3> is a slender, upright, columnar cactus.It is usually unbranched and may reach up to 6 feet (2 meters) tall and3 inches (7 centimeters) in diameter. It has from 8 to 11 ribs separatedby shallow grooves. Spines from 1 to 3 inches (2 to 7 centimeters) longoccur in groups approximately \1/2\ to \3/4\ inches (1 to 2 centimeters)apart. Opening at night, the funnel-shaped flowers are greenish-white andmay reach 6 inches (13 centimeters) in length. Fruits are a round, yellowberry without spines (Vivaldi and Woodbury 1981). Numerous black seedsare immersed in a white pulp. These fruits are a preferred food of theendangered yellow-shouldered blackbird (<T3>Agelaius xanthomus</T3>) on the island of Mona (Department of NaturalResources 1986).The species is restricted to the islands of Mona, Monito, and Desecheo;all three islands are located in the Mona Passage between Puerto Rico andthe Dominican Republic. These islands are composed of carbonate rocks,stratified limestone and dolomite, reef rock, and boulder rubble. Annualrainfall is only 32 inches (70 centimeters) in this semiarid climate. <T3>Harrisia portoricensis</T3> is primarily limited to, but common in,the semi-open xerophytic forest type associated with other species of columnarcacti.<T3>Harrisia portoricensis</T3> was recommended for Federal listing bythe Smithsonian Institution (Ayensu and DeFilipps 1978). The species wasincluded among the plants being considered as endangered or threatenedspecies by the Service, as published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (45 FR 82480) dated December 15, 1980; the November28, 1983, update (48 FR 53680) of the 1980 notice; and the September 27,1985, revised notice (50 FR 39526). The species was designated Category1 (species for which the Service has substantial information supportingthe appropriateness of proposing to list them as endangered or threatened)in each of the three notices.In a notice published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 15, 1983 (48 FR 6752), the Servicereported the earlier acceptance of the new taxa in the Smithsonian's 1978book as under petition within the context of Section 4(b)(3)(A) of theAct, as amended in 1982. The Service made subsequent petition findingsin each October of 1983 through 1988 that listing <T3>Harrisia portoricensis</T3> was warranted but precluded by other pendinglisting actions of a higher priority, and that additional data on vulnerabilityand threats were still being gathered. This proposed rule constitutes thefinal 1-year finding in accordance with Section 4(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq</T3>.) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding speciesto the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be endangered or threateneddue to one or more of the five factors described in Section 4(a)(1). Thesefactors and their application to <T3>Harrisia portoricensis</T3> Britton (higo chumbo) are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range. </T3>Destruction and modification of habitat havebeen, and continue to be, significant factors reducing the numbers of <T3>Harrisia portoricensis</T3>. Dry forests similar to that on Mona andDesecheo once covered much of southern and southwestern Puerto Rico. Thesehave been destroyed or modified for urban, industrial and agriculturaldevelopment. The cactus is no longer found in the Ponce area, its typelocation. The islands of Mona and Monito are currently managed as wildlifereserves by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources. However, inthe past, various proposals have been presented for using Mona Island,which has the vast majority of the habitat, as a superport and oil storagefacility and as a prison. Desecheo is currently protected as a NationalWildlife Refuge; however, it was once managed as a breeding colony formonkeys by the National Institute of Health. All three islands have beenutilized in the past for bombing practice by the U.S. Navy.B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes. </T3>Taking for these purposes has not been a documented factorin the decline of this species; however, problems with the take of cactiin Puerto Rico continue, even on public lands, despite their protection.Should the species be reintroduced onto mainland Puerto Rico, take couldbecome a problem. Trade in all American species of cactus is regulatedby the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of WildFauna and Flora (CITES), Appendix II.C. <T3>Disease or predation. </T3>The larvae of the cactus moth (<T3>Cactoblastis cactorum</T3>) has caused damage to <T3>Harrisia portoricensis</T3> in the past, but the moth has not beenobserved recently. Feral pigs on Mona uproot the cactus while searchingfor edible roots. Feral goats on both Mona and Desecheo forage on a varietyof species and may be responsible for shifts in vegetation composition.D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. </T3>The Commonwealthof Puerto Rico has adopted a regulation that recognizes and provides protectionfor certain Commonwealth listed species. However, <T3>Harrisia portoricensis</T3> is not yet on the Commonwealth list. Federallisting would provide interim protection and, if the species is ultimatelyplaced on the Commonwealth list, enhance its protection and possibilitiesfor funding needed research.E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>One of the most important factors affecting the continued survivalof <T3>Harrisia portoricensis</T3> is its limited distribution, which increasesits vulnerability to threats listed under factors A and C above. Thesethreats include potential habitat loss from development and the impactsfrom feral goats and pigs.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list <T3>Harrisia portoricensis</T3> as threatened. The species is restrictedto only three small islands to the west of mainland Puerto Rico, the primaryone of which is subject to habitat destruction and modification by developmentprojects, and two of which are impacted by feral animals. However, becauseplants of all sizes and ages have been observed (Vivaldi and Woodbury 1981),threatened rather than endangered status seems an accurate assessment ofthe species' condition. The reasons for not proposing critical habitatfor this species are discussed below in the ``Critical Habitat'' section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a specieswhich is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of criticalhabitat is not prudent for this species at this time. Mona Island has beendesignated critical habitat for the yellow-shouldered blackbird (<T3>Agelaius xanthomus</T3>), the Mona ground iguana (<T3>Cyclura stejnegeri</T3>), and the Mona boa (<T3>Epicrates monensis monensis</T3>); and Monito Island has been designatedas critical habitat for the Monito gecko (<T3>Sphaerodactylus micropithecus</T3>). The Service believes that Federalinvolvement in the areas where this plant occurs can be identified withoutthe designation of critical habitat. All involved parties and landownershave been notified of the location and importance of protecting this species'habitat. Protection of this species' habitat will also be addressed throughthe recovery process and through the Section 7 jeopardy standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, Commonwealth, and private agencies, groups, and individuals.The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperationwith the Commonwealth, and requires that recovery actions be carried outfor all listed species. Such actions are initiated by the Service followinglisting. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitionsagainst certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part,below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.If a species is subsequently listed, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy oradversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may adverselyaffect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federalagency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. No criticalhabitat is being proposed for <T3>Harrisia portoricensis</T3>, as discussed above. The only Federal involvementanticipated for the immediate future would be within the Service relativeto possible goat control on the Desecheo National Wildlife Refuge, andpossibly on Mona and Monito Islands relative to Service-administered grant-in-aidprojects.The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.71 and 17.72set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptions that applyto all threatened plants. All trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) ofthe Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.71, would apply. These prohibitions,in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction ofthe United States to import or export, transport in interstate or foreigncommerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for salethis species in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduceto possession the species from areas under Federal jurisdiction. Seedsfrom cultivated specimens of threatened plant species are exempt from theseprohibitions provided that a statement of ``cultivated origin'' appearson their containers. In addition, for listed plants, the 1988 amendments(Pub. L. 100-478) to the Act prohibit the malicious damage or destructionon Federal lands and the removal, cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroyingof listed plants in knowing violation of any Commonwealth law or regulation,including Commonwealth criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions applyto agents of the Service and Commonwealth conservation agencies. The Actand 50 CFR 17.72 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry outotherwise prohibited activities involving threatened species under certaincircumstances. It is anticipated that few trade permits for <T3>Harrisia portoricensis</T3> will ever be sought or issued, since thespecies in not known to be in cultivation and wild populations are relativelyinaccessible. Requests for copies of the regulations on plants and inquiriesregarding them may be addressed to the Office of Management Authority,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 3507, Arlington, Virginia 22203-3507(703/358-2104).<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited </ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningany aspect of this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularlyare sought concerning:  (1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to <T3>Harrisia portoricensis;</T3> (2) The location of any additional populations of <T3>Harrisia portoricensis</T3>, and the reasons why any habitat shouldor should not be determined to be critical habitat as provided by section4 of the Act;  (3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thisspcies; and  (4) Current or planned activities in the subject areas and their possibleimpacts on <T3>Harrisia portoricensis</T3>.  Final promulgation of the regulation on <T3>Harrisia portoricensis</T3> will take into consideration the commentsand any additional information received by the Service, and such communicationsmay lead to adoption of a final regulation that differs from this proposal. The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the proposal. Suchrequests must be made in writing and addressed to the Field Supervisor,Caribbean Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 491, BoqueroandCx.174;1n,Puerto Rico 00622.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act  </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.
