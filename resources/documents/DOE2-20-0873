The adjoint vectors usedin these formulations are obtained by taking the transpose of the matrixassociated with the regular nodal equations and finding its solutionvector. Lawrence was able to solve for the vector exactly in two-dimensionalproblems, and to a very good approximation in three-dimensional DIF3Dnodal models. Taiwo and Henry reported that the adjoint solution vectorobtained and used in their analyses corresponds to the coarse mesh finitedifference form of the QUANDRY equations. The mathematical adjoint solutionto the actual QUANDRY adjoint equation was not available at that timeand is reported here. Problems done to date have converged to the expectedeigenvalue of unity, and adjoint fluxes in fueled and reflector regionsindicate the expected trend of the two-group adjoint distribution. Theadjoint solution obtained in this work can be used in many applications.Foremost of these is the evaluation of local reactivity coefficients.Furthermore, these vectors can be used to weight cross sections and parametersin transient analysis. They can also be used to evaluate Doppler weightingfactors required for rod ejection analyses.</TEXT></DOC>
