With the guns silent since 1987 except for a few lingeringskirmishes, the central African nation has begun to tackle themonumental problems of economic survival and development.   Until very recently, international and bilateral aid programswere here to distribute emergency food to relieve hunger and counterother effects of guerrilla war and conflict with neighboring Libya,as well as a disastrous drought in 1984. Now they are here to extendaid for long-term economic recovery.   The computers, incongruous in a country where 85 percent of theestimated 5 million people are subsistence farmers and less than aquarter of all children attend school, are playing an essential role.   A senior official for the U.S. Agency for InternationalDevelopment (USAID) said the computers gather the information thatallows the most effective allocation of resources.   Computer programmers funded by the U.S. Bureau of Census andUSAID, for example, plan to help the government of President HisseneHabre conduct the nation's first census next year.   The United States gave $18.57 million in bilateral economic aidto Chad this year, while all foreign assistance in 1987 amounted to$200 million. Much of the aid helped the government pay operatingcosts and salaries of civil servants, teachers and public officials.   Gueralbaye Koumadoum, a 37-year-old secondary school teacher whoworked without pay in the worst years of the war and its aftermath,began to receive his full monthly salary, the equivalent of $368, inJanuary.   ``Things are much better now,'' he said. ``But many studentscan't afford things like paper and pens, and owning a book is a realluxury.''   Just for shared textbooks parents must pay $8 a month for eachprimary school child and $16 for every secondary school student.   A landlocked country that has long been an East-West crossroadsin the heart of Africa, Chad is classified by the World Bank as oneof the world's 10 poorest nations. Its annual per capita income is$125.   When the bottom dropped out of the world cotton market four yearsago, Chad, the largest producer of cotton in west and centralAfrica, lost nearly half its normal foreign currency revenue.   One bright spot now is oil, with reports that two wells havebegun limited production. Neither the government nor representativesof Esso, which operates a concession north of Lake Chad, wouldconfirm or deny the reports.   A World Bank-financed micro-refinery is expected to produce mostof the petroleum the country needs by the early 1990s.   Enough petroleum to meet almost 50 percent of Chad's needs is nowsmuggled from neighboring Nigeria, the remainder imported throughlegal channels.   France, the single most important donor, this year provided Chadwith $83.3 million in budgetary support, technical assistance anddevelopment and military aid.   According to figures from private French sources, Chad has only13,000 salaried employees. About 7,000 houses and offices are hookedup to electric power lines and 10,000 have water meters.   Ten percent of the government's current $83.5-million budgetcomes from taxes levied on the sale of Gala beer, one of thecountry's leading manufactured products.   Despite the monetary poverty, the towns and villages of Chad donot seem mired in the misery that characterizes many other Africancities.   ``I know it's a contradiction,'' said Diego Berriot, a WorldHealth Organization representative, ``but although Chad is among thepoorest of the African countries, the life is not nearly asmiserable as elsewhere on the continent.''   Government figures indicate this year's harvest of cereal grains,including mainstays millet and sorghum, will reach 800,000 tons,about enough to make Chad self-sufficient in food, President Habresaid in a June 7 speech marking his seventh year in power.   The World Bank, which has provided $156 million in aid since1984, says in its latest report that ``the overwhelming impressionis that Chadian entrepreneurs have a wealth of ideas and dynamicentrepreneurial spirit'' but are severely hampered by a shortage ofcapital and technology.   Since 1982 when Habre defeated rival armed factions and declaredhimself head of state, much of Chad's foreign aid has been in grantsor nearly interest-free loans.   In 1979, civil war broke out among the 11 groups that made up theshaky Government of National Union. This was complicated in late1980 by the incursion of Libyan troops on the side of GoukouniOueddei, Habre's chief rival for power and one of the majorbelligerants.   The Libyans withdrew suddenly in November 1981, leaving Goukouniseriously weakened. In June 1982, Habre's forces entered N'Djamena,bringing the main war to an end.   But sporadic fighting among rebellious army units continued inthe south until early 1985, and Goukouni's Libyan-backed forces innorth finally were defeated in July 1987 with the help of Frenchground and air forces sent to Chad in 1983.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
