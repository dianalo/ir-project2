This broad goal translatesinto four objectives that frame the Division's programs:  andbullet; Stimulate the development of exemplary educational models andmaterials (incorporating the most recent advances in subject matter, researchin teaching and learning, and instructional technology), and facilitatetheir use in the schools;  andbullet; Analyze the potential for, and explore the use of, advanced technologiesin education;  andbullet; Encourage informal learning through mass media programs that canreach large portions of the population efficiently and effectively, sciencemuseum exhibits and activities that provide direct hands on experiences,and science related programs of organizations that serve America's youngpeople; and  andbullet; Expand our understanding of the factors that promote effectiveteaching and learning of mathematics, science, and technology.  The Division employs two approaches in eliciting and selecting projectsfor support:  andbullet; It accepts ``unsolicited'' proposals submitted in response toprogram announcements describing its general purview and interests (e.g.,NSF 88-29); and  andbullet; It issues periodic program solicitations that call for proposalstargeted on specific high priority problems and opportunities. This documentis such a solicitation.  This solicitation is the second from the Instructional Materials DevelopmentProgram to focus on the creation of improved materials and model programsfor mathematics instruction. It is one of several new thrusts consistentwith the conclusions of the SRI International study of education optionsfor the National Science Foundation.1 An earlier solicitation NSF 85-60)was targeted on elementary school mathematics. That solicitation resultedin six projects which are listed in ``Summary of Grants, FY 1984-86, InstructionalMaterials Development Program'' (NSF 86-85) 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 The targetof the current solicitation is middle school mathematics. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Need for a Focus on Middle School Mathematics </ITAG>Middle schools 8 have evolved for a variety of reasons including the developmentand maturational needs of growing young adults. The middle school mathematicscurriculum bridges the gap between the elementary skill development ofthe primary years and the more rigorous, abstract study found in the secondarygrades. Recently, the quality of mathematics education offered by theseschools has been criticized.  1. In international comparisons,9, 10, 11, 12 our eighth graders have hadonly average scores in arithmetic, algebra, and geometry, and have beenin the bottom quartile in measurement. They have performed best on computationalwork, but have done poorly in situations demanding reasoning and problemsolving skills. These performances have shown no improvement in the pastdecade.13  2. Although children in the earliest grades say that mathematics is theirfavorite subject, after the eighth grade many quit the subject, and fromamong those who continue, on the average about half are lost each year.14 3. One probable reason for this attrition is the great amount of repetitionin the middle school mathematics curriculum.15 Only 35 percent is new material.The rest is review of elementary computation. 4. Many graduates from our schools lack sufficient problem-solving skillsto cope with on-the-job demands in American industry.\16\ Adults with onlyelementary mathematical skills have very few job options.\17\<ITAG tagnum="84">Background on Middle School Mathematics</ITAG>Many issues of curricular change have been widely discussed and are relevantto middle school mathematics. To provide a context for this solicitation,prospective developers of middle school materials may wish to considerthe following points.1. Curriculum StructureThe variety of currently supported National Science Foundation awards inmathematics for materials development 18,19 and for teacher enhancement20,21 indicates a clear trend toward broadening the topics covered at alllevels of mathematics education. In the middle school a wide spectrum oftopics are being incorporated including: number relationships and numbertheory, estimation and computation, patterns and functions, geometry andmeasurement, probability and statistics, and algebra and symbolic reasoning.In adddition, people are thinking about the relationships between mathematicsand other middle school subjects such as science, social studies, and English.These trends present opportunities for integrating knowledge from science,technology, and the humanities to lend context and relevance to a mathematicaleducation. Since the middle school mathematics curriculum is not well-definedin the United States, there are opportunities to combine appropriate topicsinto coherent units which tell a real mathematical story.\22\ The novelways in which these topics are being introduced and the range of choiceprovide exciting options for mathematical content in the middle schoolmathematics curriculum.There is emerging agreement that studying mathematics enhances reasoningand communication, forges links within itself and among other bodies ofknowledge, and provides a wonderful environment for formulating and solvingproblems. Middle schools offer special opportunities in both topics ofstudy and required forms of reasoning for students to grow from concreterepresentations to abstract thinking. Emphasis is shifting from developingcomputational skill to building a deeper understanding and enhancing greaterconnections which support creative use of knowledge.\23\ Students havea store of current experiences and modes of thinking which form the basisfor further learning. With deeper insight students more successfully communicatetheir understanding with each other. From this comes an ability to formulatereal problems as well as obtain both discursive and computational answers.Within the United States and throughout the world, a wide variety of curricularmaterials has been prepared and tested.\24\ Some of these contain excellentideas, problems, and methods. New curricula are appearing which will alterthe mathematical preparation of students at all levels. There is a growingawareness that improvements come from building upon the best from the past.Students come to school with differing talents and from varying home environments.These factors, in turn, cause wide variation both in rate and amount ofstudent learning. Well into middle school, students are grouped into heterogenousclassrooms with tremendous variation in accumulated student knowledge.It is not likely that this organization of our schools will change in thenear future. Some, but not enough, attention has been paid to the educationof students who fall below the average of the class. One the other hand,because the above average students sometimes do not receive a demandingeducation, it may be incorrectly assumed they are easy to teach. Middleschool teachers are asked daily to find ways in which both below-averageand above-average students can learn, be challenged, and experience achievementwith mathematics.Research on middle school teaching and learning \25\ provides a frameworkfor instructional materials development. For example, there is evidencethat on certain types of mathematical problems, ten-year-old students outperformnot only younger children but also youngsters a year or two older.\26\In this age period, students move from a concrete to a more abstract viewof mathematics. A single middle school class of students may have youngstersat all phases of this developmental change.\27\ Developing and testingmaterials provides a special opportunity to investigate coupled issuesof teaching and learning.The middle school environment, new notions about the content of the middleschool mathematics curriculum, and a sound foundation of research in teachingand learning provide an exciting background for course development. Thetime is right for a rethinking of the complete middle school mathematicscurriculum.2. Teaching MethodsThe developmental stages of the early adolescent or late preadolescenthave been studied for some time. Emphasis in teaching methods is shiftingto instruction which stresses individual or small group activities, manipulationof objects, experiments with computers or calculators, solving problems,and the generation of new problems. Students needing concrete experiencessit together in the same class with those striving for greater abstraction.An opportunity exists to combine the well-established with newer techniquesto educate more successfully this wide ranging audience.In exploring the potential for broad change in mathematics education, thereis a need to discover the real world potential and limitations of technologyin education. Innovative methods will provide an opportunity to investigatethe impact of technology on teaching. By emphasizing mathematical content,there is an opportunity to enhance the middle school mathematical experiencethrough creative applications of technology. Programs can be developedwhich incorporate significant applications of computer software tools,computer teaching software, interactive video disks, advanced calculators,and other modern technologies.3. Support for TeachersThe explosion of knowledge occurring in twentieth century science, mathematics,and engineering and the rapid introduction of technology into our economyare forcing rapid changes in the knowledge now viewed as appropriate forschool curricula. Even the best prepared teachers find it difficult tostay abreast of new topics. The National Science Foundation, through itsTeacher Enhancement Program, addresses this problem. However, the demandand need for such activities far exceeds their availability.School districts face a variety of problems in implementing a new curriculum.Instructional materials are rarely written to either give or emphasizesignificant teacher inservice direction or support. Further, there is seldomreference in materials addressing the need for school districts to engageactively in inservice efforts. There may be ways in which materials cangive appropriate guidance to school districts on ways to support theirteaching staff.Teachers do become excited by relevant, interesting, and challenging openended mathematical problems. Like students, they should have the opportunityto learn, to solve problems, and to live mathematics. Since materials developersare sometimes distant from the user classrooms, they have little controlover how their materials are used. To counteract this, they may like tothink more deeply about and experiment with instructional materials, includinga variety of possible media, as enrichers of the teacher's mathematicalexperience. A classroom provides opportunities for both the teacher andstudents to learn. It may be possible through creative use of instructionalmaterials to support teachers' needs for renewal and enhancement.4. Methods and Materials for AssessmentCurrently there is a national debate over standardized testing of students.Teachers, administrators, communities, and the nation receive mixed messagesabout the importance of testing. In the hands of the classroom teacher,the primary purpose of assessment is diagnostic. Student learning can bestbe guided if there is an understanding by the teacher of the successesand difficulties of each student. On the other hand, measurement is madenot only of a student relative to classmates, but also on an absolute scalerelative to expectations in a large society, i.e. for reasons of policyand administration.Teachers generally do not create all their own instruments and methodsfor evaluating student performance. Such assessment requires a substantialbackground in mathematics, cognitive psychology, and sociology. They lookto outside sources including the suppliers of teaching materials. Almostall evaluation is now done using multiple choice tests, pencil and papercomputations, and single answer problems. With the current interest inaltering methods of student evaluation, there is an opportunity to couplematerials development with student assessment in innovative ways.5. Experiences in Implementing New MaterialsMost authors implement and modify instructional materials in districtsand classrooms while they are under development. Experience indicates thatthe more widely materials are evaluated, the better chance they have ofsuccess. If all teachers using new materials are committed to their success,the results will markedly differ from a uniform adoption in an indifferentschool system. In an ideal world, new materials not only need to be evaluatedfor teachability in a wide variety of classrooms with a broad range ofstudents, but also should be assessed in the adoption, inservice, and implementationphases.Through the development process authors gain valuable experience on theimplementation of and support required for their materials. They oftenbecome experienced in dealing with students, parents, teachers, principals,and district administrators. They discover requirements for equipment andmaintenance costs. This experience could prove invaluable to the publishersof the materials and the school districts adopting them. Considerationof these factors may modify what constitutes effective instructional materialsand, therefore, which materials will be produced.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Solicitation</ITAG>Because of the focus on problems of mathematics education in our schools,educators have been working toward a plan for improvement. Coming froma long process of deliberation and consensus, the <T3>NCTM Curriculum and Evaluation Standards</T3> \2\\8\ and <T3>Everybody Counts</T3> \2\\9\ document first steps toward this plan.These and other recent documents address issues such as broadening thecontent of the current mathematics curriculum, shifting emphasis from computationalto problem solving skills, and recognizing the cognitive factors whichenter into teaching and learning. They provide a sound philosophical basisfor changes in content, method, and assessment. They signal high currentinterest in mathematics education providing both a foundation and an opportunityfor improvement.The purpose of this solicitation is to enhance this opportunity by expandingcurricular knowledge and experience in the critical middle school years.We expect to support a small number of key projects that propose to domost or all of the following:andbullet; Prepare course material for a complete middle school \3\\0\ mathematicscurriculum.andbullet; Explore and improve on teaching methods, possibly including newuses of technology and new applications of mathematics, appropriate forpresenting the new materials to middle school students. andbullet; Develop strategies and materials for teachers to improve theirunderstanding of mathematics and introduce them to more effective methodsof instruction. andbullet; Formulate assessment methods and materials so that teachers canevaluate and adjust the learning environment to best suit the needs ofthe students. From these projects we would hope to see several complete but differentoptions for a middle school mathematics curriculum. Furthermore, we expectthat the new materials will be based upon sound mathematics appropriateto the middle school and that new teaching materials will reflect solildresearch in the learning process. This solicitation asks for large projects with rather wide scope. Somedevelopers may prefer to address smaller, but no less important, issuesof materials development not covered by this solicitation. The InstructionalMaterials Development program of the National Science Foundation supportsa variety of such efforts through its regular program. Further informationis contained in the <T3>Program Announcement, Materials Development, Research, and InformalScience Education, </T3>(NSF, 88-29).<ITAG tagnum="84">Important considerations </ITAG>We seek creative proposals from groups or individuals who have thoughtdeeply about middle school mathematics education and who have promisingapproaches to offer. The proposer's task is to present these ideas in sucha way that a review panel of experts can understand the plans and judgethe intrinsic merits of the proposal. The writer should incorporate intothe proposal everything such a reader would need to judge the project onthe basis of the proposal alone. In your proposal it will not be necessary to establish a need for a newmiddle school mathematics curriculum. However, panelists would like toknow which issues you consider most critical in middle school mathematicsand how you will address these. They will want to know which age and gradelevels you are addressing, and your approach to curriculum, its content,and its innovations. In addition to your proposal, reviewers are especiallyappreciative of sample materials which indicate the kinds of approachesyou envision. Since curriculum now encompasses a very broad scope of methods, devices,and texts, panelists will want to know what you will produce. How willyour materials be adaptable to serve varying levels of students in differinggroups? What elementary preparation will your materials assume? How willit prepare students, beginning with an elementary conception of mathematics,for a high school curriculum? How are you anticipating the changes whichwill take place in both the elementary and high school mathematics curricula?Indicate how your materials will address the needs of all students, includingfemales, minorities, the disabled, and the gifted and talented.  Projects wil involve activities in cooperation with school systems, teachers,and classrooms. It is important to describe this trial environment andits interaction with your project. Describe who will be involved, theirqualificaitons, how they will be involved, and evidence confirming theextent and nature of their commitment. From experience with your trialenvironment you will gain insights on the adoption, implementation, use,and maintenance of your materials. How will you reflect these insightsin your materials for the benefit of future users? You should give a carfully prepared procedure to evaluate the success ofyour materials for preparing a variety of middle school students for theirhigh school experience. If research on learning will be a part of yourproject, you should clearly explain the questions to be posed, the methodsto be used, the possible outcomes, and the expected contribution to yourmaterials development. Projects should have a well-formed dissemination plan. There is a strongpresumption that instructional materials will be disseminated and usedif a variety of sources have committed services and funds to their preparationand publication. For example, proposals which have firm commitments inwriting from distributors or publishers have a greater chance of wide distributionand use. Individuals with extensive mathematical knowledge are expected to playa key role. Project personnel, individually or jontly, are expected toprovide from mathematical knowledge, wide experience in the needs of teachersand students, and broad background on the problems of educational changeat the elementary and middle school levels. Be sure to list not only thequalifications of your staff and advisors but also the tasks they are expectedto perform. List qualifications in such areas as: mathematics, mathematicseducation, technology, evaluation, school policies and procedures, andclassroom teaching at relevant levels. If you have an advisory committee,describe the way it will participate in the project. Include in your proposal the amounts and extent of cost sharing and describeany coopeative agreements you have made. Contributions from participants,beneficiaries, or other sources are strongly encouraged. These might bein the form of cash contributions, in-kind services, facilities, equipment,release time, and etc. Such additional support is convincing evidence ofthe importance of a project. To simplify the panelists task, in your budgetjustificaiton, list shared costs and NSF coss side by side. A preliminary proposal is required by this solicitation, and should bea brief description of the project you propose. Panelists often approach long proposals with trepidation and negative feelings.Organize your proposal so that it is concise, each to read, makes yourmost important points prominently, and falls within the prescribed pagelimits. Appendices can be condensed by giving sample supporting documentsthen summarizing equivalent documents. Resume's can be shaped to fit thetwo page limitation. The guidance above is not intended to serve as a complete checklist, butto suggest the sort of information panelists rely on in making judgments.If you have questions, please contact the Program Director for MathematicalSciences in the Division of Materials Development, Research, and InformalScience Education (addresses, phone numbers, and electronic mail codesare given below).<ITAG tagnum="84">Preparation and Submission of Proposals</ITAG>Who May SubmitAny organization with a scientific or educational mission is eligible tosubmit proposals.

In addition, formalproposals will receive a particularly intensive and demanding review. Forboth of these reasons, <T3>a preliminary proposal and a response from the Instructional MaterialsDevelopment Program are required before a formal proposal will be accepted.</T3>A preliminary proposal may be in the form of a comparatively brief andinformal letter-of-inquiry, outlining the concept and general structureof the contemplated project, as well as the organization(s) and personnelcontemplated, and the order of magnitude of support required. This preliminaryproposal should not exceed eight double spaced pages in length. The Programwill respond with comments on the concept and a staff opinion of the generalcompetitive status of such a proposal. Since supported projects will requiremajor commitments and time prior to submission of a successful proposal,Program comments should assist proposers in deciding whether to undertakethe cost and effort of a formal proposal.<ITAG tagnum="81">Formal Proposals</ITAG>For guidance on the specifics of formal proposal preparation, proposersshould consult the two publications: <T3>Program Announcement, Division of Materials Development, Research,and Informal Science Education </T3>(NSF 88-29); and <T3>Grants for Research and Education in Science and Engineering </T3>(NSF83-57, latest edition).The first of these publications (NSF 88-29) includes required forms thatshould accompany each proposal and a discussion of the criteria that areused in evaluating proposals.
