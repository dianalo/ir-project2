Fabric prices and export-quota premiums -- the amount onegarment maker pays to acquire another's entitlement to exporta certain item -- have reached seasonal highs, largely on arevival of U.S. consumer confidence in the wake of the Gulfconflict. But most manufacturers say they expect foreigndemand to diminish as consumers begin to focus on economicuncertainties in the U.S. and Europe, which togetheraccounted for 70.8% of Hong Kong's total garment exports lastyear.</LP><TEXT>   Many analysts and manufacturers agree that the industry'sslump -- caused by rising operating costs in Hong Kong and adecline in consumer demand overseas -- has bottomed out. Thevolume of clothing exports from the colony for six separatemonths in 1990 declined from year-earlier levels. Inaddition, the index of production for wearing apparel andtextiles dropped sharply in every quarter of 1990. The valueof domestic garment exports was $72.1 billion Hong Kongdollars (US$9.26 billion) in 1990, up only 0.3% from HK$71.9billion in 1989. Garment exports totaled HK$67.3 billion in1988 and HK$65.3 billion in 1987.   With some economists forecasting economic recovery in theU.S. by late 1991, analysts in Hong Kong say the colony'sapparel industry is poised for a comeback. The U.S. recessionhas depleted retail stocks, they say, so the first sign ofrevived consumption should trigger a rush of new orders.   Some producers perceived a surge in orders that followedthe liberation of Kuwait as the start of a sustainedrecovery. Indeed, manufacturers agree that fabric costs haverisen -- a sign of increased demand from garment makers --although the diversity of materials makes the overallincrease hard to quantify. In addition, quota premiums haverisen by between 10% and 15% since the war's end, accordingto manufacturers.   Quota premiums are considered a key barometer of sentimentin the Hong Kong garment trade. Textile exports from HongKong and other big producers have been limited by quotassince the Short-Term Cotton Agreement of 1961, which over theyears evolved into a series of so-called Multi-FiberArrangements. The current MFA is due to expire in July.   MFA quotas are designed to protect garment and textilemanufacturers in advanced industrial countries by limitingimports of cheaper items from developing countries. Theagreement allows for slight increases in quota allocations toexporting countries every year, and the quotas are coveted astickets for guaranteed access to major markets.   Major trading nations hope eventually to phase out quotasentirely under the auspices of the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade, but the MFA is expected to be renewedthrough February 1993, according to the U.S. Consulate inHong Kong.   Because Hong Kong's development as a garment manufacturingcenter coincided with the evolution of the quota system, thecolony has one of the largest and best-organizedquota-trading markets in the world. Hong Kong's total quotaallotment is distributed by the Trade Department tomanufacturers based on each company's export record for theprevious year. If a producer wants to export, say, polyestersweaters to Europe but lacks the quotas to do so, it canapproach another, usually larger manufacturer that isabandoning such a market. How much the first producer iswilling to pay for the quota, as well as the pace of overallquota trading, reflects whether garment makers expect alucrative season.   Some Hong Kong garment manufacturers say they are wary ofthe recent rise in quota premiums. While they agree that theindustry's prospects have brightened, they doubt that demandwill recover in time to boost orders for winter sales, whichtraditionally stream in during April and May.   Producers are particularly cautious because of the currentU.S. recession. In addition to suffering two years of limpsales, the U.S. retail sector is undergoing a major shakeoutamid bankruptcies tied to the big leveraged buy-outs ofrecent years.   Demand from Germany and Holland, two of Hong Kong'sbiggest markets for garments and textiles so far this year,is expected to taper off as the economies of those countriesslow. In addition, the buying power of most Europeanretailers is expected to diminish if the U.S. dollar, towhich the Hong Kong dollar is linked, continues to strengthenagainst European currencies.   In addition, Hong Kong's double-digit inflation, which hasprompted many manufacturers to move production to southernChina or even farther afield, is expected to moderate onlyslightly this year. As a result, the colony's low-endproducers will find it increasingly difficult to compete withmanufacturers based in less-developed countries.   Still, analysts expect Hong Kong's established producersto stage a quick turnaround once U.S. demand picks up andretailers are forced to augment thin inventories. Althoughthose companies posted diminished profits or only sluggishgrowth in their latest full-year or interim reports, analystssay their earnings should soon reflect the impact ofcost-containment measures.   Those companies also carry relatively little debt and arehighly liquid, having gradually moved their remaining HongKong operations to the colony's more-remote areas and thenselling old factory space for redevelopment. Most important,they enjoy a rock-solid client base that has supported themduring the bad times and will likely indulge them when theslump ends, according to analysts.   Operating margins for the colony's blue-chip apparelmakers are expected to increase only slightly, however. Mostspecialize in made-to-order bulk production of buyers'designs, which saves expenditures on design, marketing anddistribution, but discourages the kind of verticalintegration that can cushion a producer from swings inoperating costs.</TEXT></DOC>
