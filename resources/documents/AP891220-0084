Manuel Antonio Noreiga from power.   The operation may answer critics who ridiculed the decision tostay off to the side during the failed October coup attempt, butthe early hours of fighting showed the attack was fraught withmilitary and diplomatic risk.   Bush's initial concern is that Noriega be found by U.S. forcesquickly, with minimal loss of life, and brought to Florida fortrial on drug trafficking charges.   In the early going, Noriega was elusive and American soldiers _at least nine of them _ died. Some 7,000 soldiers and Marines weresent overnight into Panama to bolster the 12,000 Americans alreadystationed there.   Substantial bloodshed could turn political and public opinionagainst the Panama operation, especially if Noriega was to remainat large. It wasn't clear from the initial reaction whetherCongress or the American public would support an operation thatinvolved extensive bloodshed and drags on inconclusively for daysor even longer.   If the operation seems more like Vietnam than Grenada, Bush isin trouble.   Most of the initial congressional reaction was supportive. ButSen. Claiborne Pell, a Rhode Island Democrat and chairman of theSenate Foreign Relations Committee, said, ``Personally, unless veryclear evidence emerges of a direct threat against the Panama Canalor against American people or installations, I would not haveengaged in such unilateral or such go-it-alone action'' without thesupport of other Central American nations.   The administration braced for criticism from many in LatinAmerica, given the aversion throughout the hemisphere to U.S.unilateral action. Officials believed some would argue theoperation was a direct violation of the United Nations andOrganization of American States charters, both of which stress theimportance of non-interference in a country's internal affairs.   In Bush's view, Noriega had to go and nothing else had worked.   The United States had used an impressive array of weapons _diplomatic, economic, political _ against Noriega for almost twoyears but he seemed to be able to laugh off everything Washingtontried.   Unlike Chinese leaders, Noriega was held in such ill repute thathe never was a candidate for a we-can-do-business-together visitfrom national security adviser Brent Scowcroft.   Noriega seemed entrenched, surviving repudiation by neighborsand growing economic deprivation among his countyrmen. He called anelection, then threw out the returns when the results didn't pleasehim. When rebel officers had him in their clutches last Octoberduring a coup attempt, Noriega managed to talk his way out of it.   Since February 1988, Washington had been saying, ``Noriega mustgo.'' But he wouldn't, and didn't.   One key question mark is the degree to which President GuillermoEndara is perceived as the legitimate leader of Panama.   His strength is that he is seen as the winner of the Mayelections but his burden is that he was sworn in as president anhour before the U.S. military operations began in earnest thismorning.   Another potential risk is that the 35,000 Americans living inPanama, including U.S. servicemen, may be the targets of resentment_ or worse _ from Panamanians who believe the invasion was uncalledfor.   Is it possible the outrage among some Panamanians will be suchthat acts of sabotage will be carried out against the Panama Canal?   The irony of today's action is that when the Bush administrationtook office, there seemed to be a greater disposition to try towork in concert with other Latin American countries to solve theNoriega problem.   A U.S.-backed OAS mediation effort begun last spring with theaim of achieving a democratic transfer of power collapsed in August.   The impetus for direct U.S. action seemed to gain in Octoberwhen Bush was widely criticized for not acting more assertively insupport of the rebel insurrection against Noriega.   If Bush was looking for an excuse to act, a series of eventsstarting last Friday gave him his opening. One was a Panamaniangovernment declaration of a ``state of war'' with the United States.   Another contributing factor was the tense situation whichensued, marked by the death of one U.S. serviceman and theharassment of a U.S. Navy couple. In both cases, members of thePanamanian military were involved.   Bush had had enough, and the stage was set for the mostcontroversial decision of the Bush presidency.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   George Gedda has covered foreign affairs for TheAssociated Press since 1968.</TEXT></DOC>
