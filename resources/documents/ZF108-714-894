Plenty of brave adventurers are in a big hurryto use WordPerfect 5.1, FoxPro, Clipper 5.0, dBASE IV 1.1, and MicrosoftWindows-anything.andP;  To some, the lure of being first is irresistible.andP;  &quot;If theproduct's better, we'll do better,&quot; they hope.andP;  In hindsight,  leading thepack works out favorably enough to be a legitimate strategy.andP;  (The people whojumped into dBASE IV weren't being foolish.andP;  If it turned out to be a greatproduct, they'd have been on top.)andM;Stick to your knittingandM;The countering view says, &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot; Some people arequite happy with WordStar 3.3 1, WordPerfect 4.2, dBASE Ill and Lotus 1-2-3.andO;People who play it conservatively usually aren't very wrong.andP;  WordStar 6.0does more than 3.31, but not necessarily better.andP;  FoxPro's enhancements don'tmake it automatically superior to FoxBASE+ for all situations.andP;  And thewonderful Quattro Pro has more bugs than 1-2-3.andP;  People who restrain theirenthusiasm for the new, the different, and the &quot;better&quot; are often rewarded bya sound night's sleep.andP;  Want to know how many times I've reinstalledWordPerfect 5.1, and all the problems I still have? Or why XTreeGold takes uptwice as much disk space, but isn't as universally useful as XTreePro?andO;Upgrades aren't always progress.andP;  Products are often over-improved, resultingin bloat, slowdown, and increased hardware requirements.andM;New isn't always betterandM;It's quite easy-and common-to weaken a product's appeal by giving it too manyfeatures.andP;  Many think the solution is for software to adopt the hardwareapproach of modularity.andP;  A setup routine could let us pick the features weneed.andP;  Only the code sections meeting those needs would be installed.andP;  Thesmaller we make it, the better it will run.andP;  Those who need massive featurescould have them, and those who need unusual combinations of capabilitiescould have that too.andP;  The rest of us would have lean and mean software.andP;  Iknow, some products claim to offer this modular approach now, but not themainstream products, and not with the benefits I expect.andP;  (Admittedly,modular functionality is difficult to implement.)andM;We can agree that some new products are wonderful, some are dogs, and someare slow to mature.andP;  I need dBASE IV and look forward to using 1.1-thepublisher's approach to support makes a major difference.andP;  The featuresWordPerfect 5.1 and FoxPro 1.0 offer motivate me to work through theafter-release debugging.andP;  At least they offer frequent updates.andP;  On the otherhand, Novell's poor support makes me uncomfortable with NetWare 3.0 (release1.0 of the 386 version), and XTreeGold 1.4 still has bugs that are years old.andO;I won't count on using Clipper 5.0 until 1991.andP;  Quarterdeck's DESQview is themost promising/frustrating product I've seen.andM;Hardware isn't immune to first-release blues either.andP;  A typical example isthe Everex Step 386 computer.andP;  The box shipping now is identical on theoutside, but with several significant motherboard improvements since theproduct was introduced two years ago.andP;  Hardware, like software, is routinelychanged &quot;in-line.&quot; I have Toshiba T3200SX laptops bought two months apartthat have different BIOS ROMs (Award and Phoenix).andP;  Toshiba is switchingover, though they can't tell me why.andP;  The first Hewlett-Packard IIP laserprinters had a marginal controller board.andP;  And Seagate just adopted animproved design for the venerable ST4096 80M hard drive and painted it blackso we can tell the difference.andP;  Video cards and monitors, network components,mouse drivers, scanners, even keyboards undergo frequent, invisibleimprovements-or regressions.andM;The Maxiswitch 101, my favorite keyboard, has been through many internalrevisions.andP;  I own a dozen, yet only two work with my T3200SX and only one isusable on my Novell file server.andP;  The newest keyboards no longer have thehandy switches on the bottom to select AT or XT connection and swap Ctrl andCaps Lock locations.andP;  And my keyboards sport an unusual range of cord styles.andO;As a typing tool I've never found anything better, but the other Maxiswitch101 variations drive me crazy.andM;Software is a strange creature.andP;  Because the cost of manufacturing is verylow, software publishers can afford to sell us low-price upgrades.andP;  Webenefit by having the latest, presumably best-effort versions.andP;  They benefitby getting us to pay for bug fixes, generating additional revenue from pastcustomers, and by keeping us out of the hands of competitors.andP;  If WordStar,Lotus 1-2-3, and dBASE Ill PLUS had been updated responsively, would we havecared about products called WordPerfect, Quattro Pro, and FoxPro?andM;We don't have the same cheap upgrade opportunities with hardware.andP;  Unlessyour problem is serious and under warranty, few manufacturers will updateyou.andP;  Everex and Hewlett-Packard have swapped out IIP controllers.andP;  Butrecurring burnouts of the Compaq Portable's expensive power supply wasignored.andP;  Toshiba's wonderful PageLaser12 doesn't always survive shipping,and they won't reimburse the cost of sending back the delicate, but heavyprinter.andP;  When problems occur with no-name clone stuff, it often turns intothe most expensive equipment you can buy.andM;Plan for problemsandM;If you're conservative, you won't be bothered much by new release problems.andO;Wait at least a year before upgrading, some people advise.andP;  Don't upgradeunless you really need the new features, others recommend.andP;  &quot;Why stick yourneck out?,&quot; conservatives ask.andP;  If you're inclined to be progressive, thewater gets deep fast.andP;  Be prepared to spend hours, days, and dollarsresolving new release problems that aren't your fault.andP;  CompuServe makes afortune from people willing to pay  15 an hour or more to complain aboutproblems in products that already cost hundreds or thousands of dollars.andO;What an industry !andP;  The cost of progressandM;Now for the business part.andP;  What's the cost of your time? How much do youcharge? When you're fooling around with new product problems, you're spendingtime without getting paid.andP;  It's common to spend thousands of dollars in timediscovering workarounds for a $200 product.andP;  (How much has DESQview cost youin time spent?) If you're a hobbyist, have fun.andP;  But if you're a professionalconsultant, know the real cost of using new stuff.andM;The cost of adopting new products and versions has to be paid for by someone.andO;When one of my clients tackles something new without my help, four out offive times I end up resuscitating the victim.andP;  After wasting a considerableamount of staff time, the client ends up paying me to make it work.andP;  I don'tblame clients for this, since some products do work as advertised and Idislike providing services that aren't needed.andP;  My practice is to tellclients (if I'm aware of their plans) what things they can do and which Ishould do for them.andP;  Like any good consultant, my rates are related to value.andO;Whether training, installing, programming, or consulting, skill and speed areworth a higher rate.andP;  The time we invest discovering the quirks of a productlet us do in two hours what might take a client 20 hours.andM;A mind is a terrible thing to wasteandM;Training has a similar equation.andP;  Educational books and magazines like DataBased Advisor are terrific bargains.andP;  People pay for training from expertsand for on-site tutoring and consulting because it's a favorable equation.andO;Buy a few days of training and acquire the benefit of the thousands of hoursthe expert spent mastering the topic.andP;  I'm always dismayed when someone isunwilling to buy training or attend a conference.andP;  I'm disturbed because ifthe information is needed, these group events can be the cheapest way to getit.andP;  If you charge $50 per hour and spend $1,500 to attend a conference orseminar, will you learn something worth 30 hours of billing.? Chances are,you'll learn enough to save those 30 hours over and over again.andP;  You mighteven learn enough to become more qualified, justifying a rate increase to$75, so the next $1,500 event will only cost you 20 hours of billing.andM;Training, seminars, reading, and experimentation provide you with knowledge.andO;In the consulting business, knowledge is your real product.andP;  Anyone can dothe mechanical parts of computer activity, if only they know what to do andhow to do it.andP;  I spend at least 25 percent of my time acquiring knowledge.andO;That's a large part of what consulting clients pay for.andP;  Even softwaredevelopment charges must be evaluated by considering more than the bottomline.andP;  How appropriate is the database product, how well do the programmersknow its weaknesses as well as its strengths, how good is the applicationdesign, and what will happen when needs change over time? Survival as aprofessional consultant/developer/VAR requires a few things.andP;  Among them areethics and cutting edge knowledge.andP;  Clients demand the former and will payfor the latter.andP;  In light of what you know about the pros and cons of usingnew products, consider how you present your knowledge.andP;  When a client asks,&quot;Should I switch to NetWare 386?&quot;, my answer varies with what I know aboutthe client's situation.andP;  I might say, &quot;Yes, you need the performanceimprovement.&quot; Or, &quot;Maybe, but you'd save money and get more benefit byupgrading your slow file server.&quot; To some I'd respond, &quot;Don't do anything.andO;Your system is adequate.andP;  Keep your money.&quot; I can make such statementsbecause I've invested a great deal in research and experimentation.andP;  Theconsultant should suffer with new products so the client doesn't have to.andP;  IfI spend 100 hours evaluating network alternatives, and 50 clients pay me fortwo hours of analysis and advice, I come out okay and my clients avoid costlymistakes.andM;Risks and rewardsandM;Not every pioneer discovers a new world.andP;  Some trips into the unknown end intragedy, while others lead to legendary success.andP;  When faced with the choiceof moving ahead or standing still, don't immediately take a step forward.andO;Consider the possible risks and rewards.andP;  And have a disaster recovery planshould the opportunity turn down that path.andP;  If the new software turns out tobe too buggy, can your design be implemented in the previous version, or willyou have to wait for a fix? Can the client wait? If new hardware developsproblems, what will you do while it's undergoing repair?andM;On the other hand, what's the cost of being too conservative? If upgradeoffers are ignored, isn't that money lost? If a new version saves time, doesmore, operates more reliably, or opens more doors, consider the cost ofstaying with the older version.andP;  It can be as expensive to under-usetechnology as to foolishly leap before you look.andM;New surveyandM;The response to my &quot;Programmer-Musician&quot; survey was so enthusiastic that it'stime for another one, &quot;Consultant Practices.&quot; Tell me how you go about beinga developer/consultant/VAR.andP;  What kind of work do you do? What hours do youwork? How do you mix business, family, and pleasure? Lay it all out.andO;Describe your company, job, and work environment, your background, interests,strategies, and plans for the future.andP;  Any personal information isappreciated, from age and gender to fees and income.andP;  The sensitive stuffwill be tabulated and reported anonymously.andP;  I'll only print personalinformation that you authorize.andP;  Respond to the address or BBSs listed below.andM;John L.
