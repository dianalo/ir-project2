President Bush gave his speech commemorating thefirst 10 Amendments to the Constitution before a group thatincluded dozens of guests wearing headphones forinstantaneous translation of his talk into Russian. Among theguests were the Ministers of Justice from Armenia, Bulgaria,Estonia, Kazakhstan and Moldavia.   &quot;The Framers of our Constitution confronted problems notunlike those that the Central and Eastern Europeanconstitution writers face today,&quot; Mr. Bush said. His speechwas interesting partly for what it did not mention. He didnot refer to the modern Bill-of-Rights fare according to theACLU -- no mention of judge -- made exclusionary rules orMiranda warnings, nothing about rubbing &quot;In God We Trust&quot; offcoins or removing creches from public parks.</LP><TEXT>   Instead, Mr. Bush went to the heart of the Bill of Rights.This was the effort by the Founders, now being emulated bythe newly freed peoples of the world, to deny governmentofficials power to interfere with political freedoms and freemarkets. Mr. Bush stressed that the Founders created themodel for a system of government limited in size, scope andambitions by legally required respect for private property.   &quot;They made the Constitution a powerful legal instrumentfor economic opportunity and growth,&quot; Mr. Bush said, citingthe economic rights enshrined in the Takings Clause of theFifth Amendment, the Commerce Clause and the Due ProcessClause. &quot;By protecting a worker's earnings and savings, afamily's home or a small businessman's stake from unfairconfiscation or ruinous overregulation, this principle seeksto protect the whole of society from gluttonous government.&quot;   Mr. Bush noted that the U.S. has not always lived up tothe original intent. &quot;I simply cannot believe that theFramers envisioned that the central government would spend aquarter of the gross national product of this country,&quot; hesaid. The good news is that the new conservative-libertarianSupreme Court has agreed to hear several cases this term thatshould resurrect economic rights to property, contracts anddue process.   Before Mr. Bush's talk, the Justice Ministers from behindthe former Iron Curtain spent several days at a conference inWashington on &quot;Prosperity and the Rule of Law,&quot; sponsored bythe National Taxpayers Union and Swedish TaxpayersAssociation. It was an historical moment to see these men andwomen takes notes in Cyrillic from Richard Epstein, who wasJoseph Biden's nemesis during the Clarence Thomas hearings,and Bernard Siegan, turned down for a judgeship by the SenateJudiciary Committee as too &quot;extreme&quot; on economic rights. Bothscholars stressed that the new constitutions must protectworkers and property owners from abusive regulations thattake away property as surely as outright confiscations.   The collapse of communism is a timely reminder of theimportance of our own Bill of Rights. The Soviet experimentwith people's lives and fortunes was possible only in asystem created to deny political or economic liberties. Thenewly freed East Europeans will likely be especially vigilantin guarding against any relapses on either score. After 200years, Americans should make sure they also respect theheritage of the Founders.</TEXT></DOC>
