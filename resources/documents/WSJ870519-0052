PerryStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/19/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Britain's third party, the Alliance of the Liberals and Social Democrats, published a campaign platform that weaves a careful course between the ruling Conservative Party on the right and the Labor Party on the left.    The campaign leading up to the June 11 general election will move into full swing today, with the publication of platforms by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives and Neil Kinnock's Labor Party.    The Alliance this year wants to establish itself as the nation's No. 2 party, ahead of Labor, and its hopes of running a good race can't be dismissed. In its six-year history, the party has shown a pattern of strong finishes. Four years ago, it almost came in second.    The Alliance also is prepared to join either Labor or the Conservatives in a ruling coalition, in the possible but hardly likely event that no party holds a majority in the 650-seat House of Commons after next month's elections.    What the Alliance seems to want most is a unique package of constitutional reforms. That's surely what it would demand in return for supporting Labor or the Conservatives.    At the top of the reform list is replacement of Britain's current electoral system -- in which parliamentary seats are awarded to the winners of each individual election -- with a proportional-representation system that would allow more Alliance candidates to take seats in parliament. Under such a system, the proportion of the overall vote that each party wins would determine the number of seats it holds.    The Alliance also calls for repeal of the long-controversial Official Secrets Act, enactment of freedom-of-information legislation and incorporation of the Bill of Rights protocols of the European Convention of Human Rights into British law. In addition, the party favors the creation of legislative assemblies in Wales, Scotland and various regions of England.    The Alliance platform offers more for almost everyone -- more than the Conservatives are willing to provide but not nearly as much as Labor vows it would spend if it won the election.    The centerpiece of the Alliance platform is a pledge to cut unemployment by one million persons by putting the jobless to work repairing and rebuilding ramshackle housing, insulating low-income housing and cleaning up run-down areas in inner-city public housing projects. Three million Britons currently are out of work.    An Alliance government would enlarge various government skill-training programs and create incentives for companies to take on additional employees from the hard-core jobless.    The welfare state, still thriving after eight years of Tory rule, would be expanded. The Christmas bonus for pensioners and widows, for example, would be increased sharply, to the current equivalent of $67.38 for a single person from $16.85. Pensioners also would receive a $67.38 &quot;death grant,&quot; to help pay their funeral expenses.    This &quot;controlled expansion&quot; of public spending would be paid for by higher government borrowing -- $6.74 billion extra each year -- and without a provision for an immediate general tax increase.    The two parties in the Alliance remain divided over what to do with Britain's independent nuclear deterrent, the Polaris submarines. They have worked out a compromise in which they say they would scrap plans to replace the Polaris submarines with new Trident nuclear submarines, while maintaining some kind of minimum nuclear deterrent. This ill-defined position isn't highlighted in the platform.    Dr. David Owen, the leader of the Social Democrats, and David Steel, leader of the Liberals, told a press conference here that the Alliance program aims to transform British society, bringing its class divisions to an end and providing &quot;a degree of comfort to those who are unable to live a full and satisfying life.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
