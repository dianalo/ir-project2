Poindexter, and fired White House aide Lt. Col.Oliver L. North were indicted Wednesday along with two arms dealerson charges they conspired to divert Iranian arms sales profits tothe Nicaraguan Contras.   The long-awaited 23-count indictment, which also named retiredAir Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and his business partner,Albert Hakim, said the four men ``deceitfully and without legalauthorization'' organized, directed and concealed ``a program tocontinue funding of and logistical and other support for militaryand paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by the Contras'' at a timeU.S. law barred such action.   The indictment charged that proceeds from the the $30 millionworth of U.S. arms sales to Iran were diverted illegally to foreignbank accounts controlled by Secord and Hakim for their personalfinancial gain.   Only $12.2 million from the arms sales was turned over to theU.S. government, according to the indictment.   Hakim and Secord also were charged with conspiring to payillegal gratuities to North by arranging the installation of asecurity system at the Marine officer's home and by creating a$200,000 fund for his family in a Swiss bank.   Outside the U.S. Courthouse, Iran-Contra independent counselLawrence E. Walsh told reporters the investigation was continuingbut declined to say whether there would be any more criminalcharges brought in the case.   ``The grand jury is not finished,'' Walsh said. ``This is simplyan interim report.''   North, who was fired from his job as a National Security Councilaide in late 1986, said: ``I did not commit any crime. I intend tofight the allegations of wrongdoing for as long as necessary.''   His voice breaking, North said the months ahead will bedifficult. But, he added: ``Nonetheless, I can asure you, I willnever give up, we will win, I just cannot tell you how soon.''   North's attorney, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., told repoorters itwill be necessary to call high-ranking officials to North's trial.   Sullivan said the indictment was an abuse of the criminalprocess and said a criminal court is not the place to solve adispute between the president and Congress.   ``It is mind-boggling to consider a protracted trial,'' Sullivansaid.   A secretary in Secord's office said he was out of town and hadnot commented on the indictment.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan was informedof the indictments by Kenneth Duberstein, his deputy chief ofstaff. Speaking of Reagan, Fitzwater said, ``He had no response.''He said there was no White House comment because ``it's a matterbefore the courts.''   Just hours before the indictment, Reagan was asked if he stillstood by his assertion that no laws were broken in the Iran-Contraaffair. ``I have no knowledge of anything that was broken,'' hereplied.   Asked why he felt that way, he replied, ``because from all ofthe investigation and everything else, we don't know where thatmoney came from and we don't know who had it and we don't knowwhere it went. All I know was that we got the purchase price we hadasked for.''   But the indictment, among other things, charged that North andSecord conspired to divert millions of dollars from the sale ofU.S. government arms to the alleged ``Enterprise.''   Among other things the indictment charged that North persuadedthe CIA to lower its price from $6,000 to $3,469 for each of the1,000 TOW missiles sold to Iran in February 1986 even though theIranians were paying $10,000 apiece.   As a result, the ``Enterprise'' kept more than $6 million andturned over only $3.7 million to the U.S. government, theindictment said.   In May 1986, only $6.5 million of the $15 million that Iran paidfor spare Hawk missile parts was turned over to the U.S.government, leaving nearly $8.5 million for the ``Enterprise,'' theindictment said.   The indictment culminated a 14-month grand jury investigationinto the arms-for-hostages deals with Iran and the diversion ofnearly $4 million in profits to the Contras.   All four defendants were charged with conspiracy to defraud thegovernment and commit criminal offenses against it, theft ofgovernment property and wire fraud arising from the diversion ofarms-sale proceeds.   The these charges together carry maximum penalties of 25 yearsimprisonment. Each of the three charges carries a potential$250,000 fine.   North was named in nine counts charging him with obstruction ofCongress, making false statements, obstructing Attorney GeneralEdwin Meese III's Nov. 21-23, 1986, inquiry by making falsestatements and concealing, falsifying and destroying classifiedgovernment documents in NSC files.   Meese's weekend inquiry uncovered the diversion of arms-saleprofits and led to Poindexter's resignation and North's dismissalfrom the NSC staff.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
