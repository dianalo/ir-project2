The volume of U.S. stock and bond offerings in the sixmonths ended Friday soared 59% to a record $261.9 billionfrom $165.2 billion a year earlier, according to SecuritiesData Co.</LP><TEXT>   Corporate America's capital-raising boom -- particularlythe jump in new stock issues -- sent Wall Street's disclosedunderwriting fees soaring 65% to $2 billion in the firsthalf. That was up from the $1.2 billion in the year-earlierperiod and exceeded Wall Street's total for all of 1990.Investment banks earn underwriting fees by buying newsecurities from corporate issuers and reselling them to thepublic.   The surge in new stock and bond issues is adding to WallStreet's budding recovery, which began early this year with astrong stock-market rally. Though Wall Street's mergeradvisory business remains slow, the jump in new stockofferings is reviving the fortunes of many beleagueredinvestment bankers.   Securities firms' fees for underwriting new equity issuescan run from 3% to 7% of the proceeds; the average fee forstock deals was 5.8% for the first half, Securities Datasays.   Analysts look for underwriting to be the driving force insecurities firm profits in the second quarter. Because of thenew-issue activity, investment-banking revenues jumped anaverage of 25% for big securities firms from the firstquarter, offsetting lower trading profits, estimates LawrenceEckenfelder, a brokerage analyst for Prudential SecuritiesInc.   But the market for new stock issues recently has showedsigns of slowing. Institutional cash levels are low. Moneymanagers already have piles of new offering documentslittering their desks. And new stock issues are getting moredifficult to bring to market. In the past couple of weeks,several companies, including Ambac Corp., have delayed theirstock-market debuts.   &quot;It's a clear sign that issuers see the market gettingvery toppy,&quot; says David H. Komansky, executive vice presidentat Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and head of its equity markets group.   Another sign of a possible slowdown: Issuers are cuttingprices to satisfy increasingly demanding investors. &quot;Therecertainly is much more selectivity on the part of equitybuyers,&quot; says Michael Madden, co-head of investment bankingat American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. unit.Investors &quot;want that extra little bargain.&quot;   Nevertheless, the new-issue market should remain fairlystrong for the rest of the year, investment bankers predict.Nearly 100 initial public stocks offerings, which seek toraise about $3 billion, already are planned for the thirdquarter, Securities Data says.   Much of the underwriting explosion took place in thesecond quarter. The volume of new stock and bond issuessoared 77% in the second quarter to $150.6 billion from $85.2billion. And disclosed fees more than doubled to $1.3 billionfrom $607.3 million.   In the first half, the volume of new stock issues morethan doubled to $25.9 billion from $12.8 billion. Two-thirdsof that volume was from so-called secondary issues, oradditional stock offerings by already-public companies.   The rebound in new stock issues has been propelled by thestock market's rise, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up11% so far this year. The rally means corporations can gethigher prices for their stock in a market of eager buyers. Ofcourse, any sudden downdraft in stock prices could cut theequity party short.   Companies have taken advantage of the rally to slash heavydebt loads they piled up in the 1980s. Indeed, more than 22%of new-stock issue proceeds in the first half was used toreduce debt.   Companies taken private in leveraged buy-outs -- includingDuracell International Inc., RJR Nabisco Holdings Inc. andAnnTaylor Stores Corp. -- have gone public in recent monthsby selling stock. In all, 15 IPOs with proceeds of $1.2billion were companies that previously had gone through LBOs.&quot;This is a further sign that de-leveraging will be one of themajor trends of the 1990s,&quot; Securities Data says.   Biotechnology issues have sizzled most. There have been 40biotech stock issues totaling $1.5 billion, up from 14 for$376 million in the 1990 first half. About one-third of thebiotech offerings were IPOs.   While the surge in new stock issues has caught thepublic's eye, there has been a record crop of new bond issuesas well. The volume of debt issues in the first half leaped68% to $92.4 billion from $54.9 billion a year earlier,Securities Data says. Much of the new debt was investmentgrade, as treasurers at blue-chip corporations decided thatlong-term interest rates aren't likely to go much lower.   Corporate issuers &quot;are taking advantage of the best ratesthey have seen since 1986,&quot; says Jessica Palmer, head ofcapital markets at Salomon Brothers Inc. As a result, somecompanies are &quot;front-loading&quot; their financing plans, Mrs.Palmer says, with some of Salomon's clients meeting all their1991 debt-financing needs in the first half.   With long-term interest rates moving up in recent weeks,some corporations that had held back from tapping the bondmarket, such as Eastman Kodak Co. and McCormick andamp; Co., havejumped in. Investment bankers say issuers are concerned thatinterest rates will go still higher as the economy recovers.   &quot;In the last four weeks, when interest rates started toclimb, a lot of people on the fence entered the market andlocked in attractive rates,&quot; says Walid A. Chammah, managingdirector and head of First Boston Corp.'s taxable debtcapital markets group.   With takeovers on the wane, few new bond issues haveso-called poison-pill puts. This feature -- which becamepopular after the record $25 billion RJR takeover -- allowsbondholders to force a company to buy back its bonds at afixed price if the company changes hands. In 1989, 120 issuescontained poison-pill puts; this year, there have been three:Parker Hannifin Corp., Penn Central Corp. and Chiquita BrandsInc.   Barring a spike-up in interest rates, the heavy bondissuance is likely to continue, investment bankers say.Corporate issuers have &quot;taken a bite of the apple,&quot; saysGrant Kvalheim, a Merrill managing director. &quot;If rates godown more, they'll take another bite.&quot;   Investors have even been nibbling at new issues ofhigh-yield &quot;junk&quot; bonds. After the market for new junk bondsnearly evaporated last year, 12 new junk issues were broughtto market in the second quarter alone, raising $2.6 billion.Among them were RJR and Chiquita Brands.   But no one expects a return to the heydays of junk, whenas much as $11.1 billion in new junk bonds were sold in asingle quarter. Despite the modest junk revival, &quot;thenew-issue market is still licking a lot of wounds,&quot; saysKingman D. Penniman, senior vice president at Duff andamp;Phelps/MCM Investment Research Co.   One arena where growth has slowed is the asset-backed debtmarket. The volume of issues packaging credit-cardreceivables and other consumer debt into securities totaled$23.6 billion in the first half, up 18% from the $20 billiona year earlier; but the gain waan't as steep as in prioryears. Early this year, Moody's Investors Service warned thatthe credit quality of the assets backing such securities --specifically credit cards -- continues to deteriorate.   But the market for mortgage-backed securities continued toboom. There was $108 billion in new mortgage-backed bondissues in the first half, a 53% jump from the $70.6 billion ayear earlier. Mortgage-back deals, which recently have beenspurred by a pickup in housing activity, have grown larger,with the average issue this year $325 million, nearly 30%bigger than 1990's average.   The volume of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securitiestogether jumped nearly 45% from the 1990 first half. And themarket for these securitized loans is now nearly double thesize of just three years ago, Securities Data says.   Meanwhile, underwriting activity overseas reboundedsmartly. After sputtering in 1990, the volume of new issuesin the Eurobond and international stock market totaled $128.4billion in the first half, a 42% jump from the $90.3 billionin the year-earlier period.   Behind the jump was a return of Japanese companies to themarketplace. So far this year, Japanese firms have raised$21.4 billion, or 17% of the market, about double the $11.5billion, or 12.7% of the market, a year earlier.   ---        Disclosed Fees From New Issue Underwriting                                                                                                            SIX MONTHS 1991                SIX MONTHS 1990                                                                                                         AMOUNT   % OF    NUMBER      AMOUNT        % OF   NUMBER  (In        MKT.
