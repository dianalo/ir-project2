Some want drastic changes in the way the U.S. countsits population. Some want a simpler census form. Some evenwant the nation to stop trying to count everybody.   As this debate begins, the real estate industry worriesthat the changes could skew its studies on home sales,affecting both home buyers and homeowners and sending ripplesthroughout the economy. Marketers are troubled that a simplercensus survey might impede their efforts to target consumersfor their products. And the American Civil Liberties Union isworried that developments in computer technology could makethe census a tool to invade the privacy of millions ofAmericans.   The battle is getting under way against the backdrop ofthe court skirmishes, political clashes and statisticalquestions that still linger over the 1990 census. The debateunderscores the importance that demographic information hastaken on in the modern age.   &quot;Census data affect everybody's lives and everybody'sdecisions,&quot; says Martha Farnsworth Riche, director of policystudies at the Population Reference Bureau. &quot;And with thecensus data in libraries, they will be in the hands ofindividuals in a way that they have never been before. Ifinformation is power, this is real empowerment.&quot;   Census information affects federal spending, housingdevelopment and marketing schemes. It shapes wage patterns,clothing prices and even such decisions as highwayconstruction. It helps church boards decide whether torenovate and expand -- or move. It helps merchandisers decidewhat to put in their stores. And it gives definition to majorpolitical controversies.   &quot;The census data go a long way toward framing the majorissues of the day,&quot; says Peter Morrison, a demographer atRand Corp. &quot;They tell us who is in poverty, and they definethe salient political groups.&quot;   That's why the stakes are so high. The House populationsubcommittee is planning a series of hearings on the 2000census. The National Academy of Sciences is beginning a studyon the question. And the Commerce Department, which hasopened its own review, is itself arguing that &quot;it is time fora thorough re-examination of census taking in the U.S.&quot;   It isn't too early to start. Planning for last year'scensus began six years before the first forms were mailedout, but even that left too little time to make significantchanges between 1980 and 1990. &quot;By starting earlier thistime, we have a shot at doing things very differently in2000,&quot; says Harry Scarr, deputy assistant commerce secretaryfor statistical affairs.   Already a number of groups are asking that the census seekmore information. The American Association of the Blind wouldlike the next census to ask Americans if they have troubleseeing, or are blind. Pet-food manufacturers would like toknow how many dogs and cats are in U.S. homes. A variety ofgroups would like revisions in the race questions todetermine the number of Americans of mixed parentage.   One of the principal proposals is to simplify the censussubstantially, gathering only the information required forcongressional reapportionment and redistricting: population,age and race.   Some officials, including a large faction among the careerstaff inside the Census Bureau, believe a simplified censuswould cut costs and increase public cooperation, whichdropped precipitously in the last decade. The cost for takingthe 1980 census ran to more than $1 billion, more than thethree previous censuses combined. The final cost of the 1990census is expected to be even greater.   The Census Bureau is planning a test next year todetermine whether public participation would increase with ashorter form. &quot;That's fine constitutionally,&quot; says RobertGroves, associate director of the Census Bureau forstatistical standards and methodology. &quot;But on the otherhand, this country needs information, and a lot of groupshave come to count on census data.&quot;   The National Association of Realtors, for example, usesdecennial census data for its studies on home sales. &quot;Thisinformation really is a benchmark for a lot of meaningfulstatistics that are important for business decisions,&quot; saysWalter Molony, spokesman for the association. JeffreyPassell, a demographer at the Urban Institute, says thecurrent census surveys provide information that can't bereplicated.   &quot;You can get a lot of this information, but you can't getit in a uniform way where you had confidence about thestatistical integrity of it,&quot; says William Frey, asociologist and demographer at the University of Michigan.&quot;There's a big expense, of course, but there's a bigadvantage to having that information.&quot;   Indeed, James Madison argued in the First Congress that adetailed census would help Congress understand the characterof the new nation. The foremost spokesman of a thoroughcensus, he wanted to have a base for measuring the growth anddevelopment of the country.   The census has been in a constant state of change sincethe first one, which was conducted by federal marshals whoreported directly to President Washington. But from thebeginning, the census has had its skeptics; though historianshave decided that the count of 3,929,214 in 1790 was accuratewithin 411 persons, President Washington was convinced that&quot;the real number will greatly exceed the official return.&quot;   Two centuries later, some demographic specialists arearguing that the population of the country can be just asaccurately determined by using computer models along withrecords, such as drivers' licenses and information fromgovernment agencies. The Census Bureau uses computers andsampling techniques in other studies it performs, includingits monthly surveys that are used to provide basicunemployment and other statistics.   But there remains real resistance to using samplingtechniques, which produce national profiles from relativelysmall sets of interviews, in the decennial census.   &quot;It's not enough for the census just to be accurate,&quot; saysBruce Johnson, former head of the 21st Century staff at theCensus Bureau. &quot;It has to be perceived as fair by the public.If it's not seen as fair, it's not a successful census. Ifyou use computer models, you might be more accurate, but thepublic may have a hard time understanding how the numbers arearrived at.&quot;   ---                      Who's Counting?
