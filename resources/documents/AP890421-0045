The bar, easily located by the 41-foot long, 3,000-poundfiberglass iguana on its roof and a giant fiberglass dragonflyinside, closed last weekend.   Going to the Lone Star was something even real Texans admitteddoing when in New York City. It became a mecca for country musicjust as ``Urban Cowboy'' mania was sweeping the nation in the late1970s.   The Texas Legislature in 1981 thought enough of the Lone Star tomake it the official Texas ``embassy'' in New York City, and saidthe club's location, at Fifth Avenue and 13th Street, was sovereignTexas soil ``now and forever.''   Alas, just as everything's big in Texas, so was the rentincrease announced at lease renewal time. The Lone Star's landlordtrebled the rent.   Co-owners Bill Dick and Mort Cooperman bid a daylong adios tothe Lone Star Cafe last week and reminisced about the time a drunkfell into the arms of visiting King Juan Carlos of Spain, and howLarry King, author of ``The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,''decreed the club would never succeed when it opened its doors in1977.   Dick and Cooperman, riding high on the Cafe's success, lastsummer opened a second Texas-style retreat, The Lone StarRoadhouse, in Manhattan.   Frank Mills, a Lone Star regular, hopes the Lone Star Roadhousewill be just like his old haunt.   ``The Lone Star was a place you could strike up a goodconversation and listen to great music,'' said Mills, an aspiringsongwriter from Brooklyn who says it's taken time to get used tothe uptown location, which has decor similar to the old location.   Anne Segrest, a manager at the new place, is convinced Caferegulars will flock uptown.   ``There's no other place in New York that they can listen to JoeEly or Delbert McClinton,'' said Segrest of the Southwest singers.</TEXT></DOC>
