The 600 boys and girls looked perfectly ordinary, but they hadone thing in common: all were test-tube children. They gathered inthe sunshine Sunday with their balloons and ice creams for areunion at the clinic one might call their birthplace.   The guests ranged from infants a few weeks old to 11-year-oldLouise Brown, the world's first test-tube child.   They released 1,295 yellow balloons, one for every test-tubebaby conceived at Bourn Hall Clinic. They posed on the lawn for agroup photograph, and Louise planted a walnut sapling in memory ofthe late Patrick Steptoe, the man who co-founded the clinic andpioneered the test-tube baby technique.   ``Never before have so many test-tube babies been gatheredtogether in one place at one time,'' declared medical directorPeter Brinsden, in a speech welcoming Bourne Hall's progeny. ``Youare the message of hope for other people around the world.''   More than a decade has passed since Louise Brown's birth inEngland on July 25, 1978 heralded the dawn of what became known asin vitro fertilization, or IVF.   The technique invented by Steptoe and his partner, RobertEdwards, involves removing the egg from the mother's ovary,fertilizing it with sperm in a dish, and returning the egg to thewomb to grow into a normal embryo.   For women who could not conceive because of such afflictions asblocked fallopian tubes, IVF was their salvation. But it remainsdifficult, painful and expensive, and only some 10,000 babiesworldwide have been born by IVF.   ``So many of you suffered pain, anxiety, stress, tension, andthen fortunately all of you had joy and happiness,'' Brinsden toldthe parents gathered outside the clinic.   ``So it was worthwhile for you,'' he said. ``But I'd like youjust to bear in mind that for every one of you, there are seven oreight or nine others who have not been as fortunate as you. So letus think today also of the people who have not been as lucky,''   Among the children enjoying the jugglers, brass band and Punchand Judy show, was Greece's first test-tube child, ChristineIordanidou, 7.   Standing with Christine and her parents was another Greekcouple, Dimitri and Diamanto Marsellos, and their 4-year-oldtest-tube son John.   Mrs. Marsellos said she had only one fallopian tube and it wasblocked. The couple visited American doctors who told her nothingcould be done. Then after hearing about Christine Iordanidou ontelevision, they visited Steptoe and Edwards.   ``Dr. Steptoe accepted us,'' said Marsellos. ``I said, `all overthe world we were told there was no hope. What makes you so sureyou can help?' and Dr. Steptoe said something I will never forget.He said: `Your case is one of the most difficult cases, and weaccept difficult cases.'''   Louise Brown has entered her pre-teens thoroughly at ease withfame. Wearing a pink dress and white ribbon in her long, goldenhair, she faced the cameras patiently while her parents fieldedreporters' questions.   ``I think the party's absolutely marvelous. I never thought whenLouise was born that we would one day see so many children. It'slovely,'' said Louise's mother, Leslie, 41.   Louise's father, John, a 48-year-old truck driver, said thecouple often receives letters from parents of test-tube children,asking whether such children need anything special for theirupbringing.   ``We just say, do the natural thing; bring up the children,''Brown said.   The Browns have a second test-tube daughter, 6-year-old Natalie.   Steptoe died last year, but Edwards was at the party and usedthe opportunity to deliver an impassioned appeal for more researchand financing for techniques of assisted conception.   ``When you think that maybe one couple in 10 is infertile, we'vegot a lot of work to do,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
