VMS DECnet wasthought to be connected with the anti-nuclear activists' attempt to stop thelaunch of the shuttle Atlantis.andP;  But later a NASA spokesman said it probablywas the work of an individual unconnected with the Atlantis protest.andM;Carolynne White of Goodard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said in aninterview that NASA officials believe the worm most likely originated inEurope.andM;White said every one of the 60 infected SPAN nodes was penetrated because ofpoor password selection.andP;  White said the worm entered nodes by starting withuser names for privileged accounts, then atteacked the security system bytrying variations of the user name as passwords.andM;The attacks succeeded because the worm guessed the correct passwords, notbecause it bypassed software security.andM;Reports from NASA officials said this was a mostly beign attack.andP;  The WANKworm would enter a node and change user passwords, making the systemunavailable until it was repaired by troubleshooters.andP;  The worm apparentlydid no damage to files or programs.andM;Despite this, there was a considerable amount of lost computing time involvedin eradicating the worm, besides the lost user time while nodes wee down.andM;R.andP;  Kevin Oberman of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories said in anetwork-published report, &quot;This is a mean bug to kill and could have done alot of damage.andM;&quot;Since it notifies [by mail] someone of each successful penetration andleaves a trapdoor [the Field account], just killing the bug is not adequate.andO;You must go in and make sure all accounts have passwords and that thepasswords are not the same as the account name.&quot;andM;Oberman's report went on to say that the worm first checks to see if anothercopy already is running by looking for a process name starting with the firstfour letters &quot;Netw ...&quot;.andM;Because W.COM can attack any VMS DECnet system, all VMS users should notethat a quick check for infection is to look for a process name starting with&quot;Netw&quot;.andP;  This may be done with a SHOW PROCESS command.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
