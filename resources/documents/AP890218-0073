In another development, the Department of Transport said it wastesting a U.S.-made scanner that can detect plastic explosives,which were believed used to blow up the Pan Am jet. The departmentdenied a report Sunday in the weekly Mail that the instrumentalready was in use at London's Heathrow airport.   ``As it uses neutrons, we have to make sure it is absolutelysafe,'' a spokesman said of the computer scanner. The newspaperreport said two similar computers were successfully tested at LosAngeles and San Francisco airports.   British Airways, Britain's biggest airline was acting on aDepartment of Transport recommendation that all airlines usingBritish airports examine radios, computers and other electronic orelectrical equipment for possible explosives.   A department spokesman said the suggestion was sent to airlinesFriday and is aimed mainly at battery-operated transistor radios,lap-top computers and cassette recorders in which explosives can beeasily hidden, rather than smaller items such as hair dryers.   An airline spokesman said British Airways started askingpassengers to take all electrical and electronic equipment out oftheir suitcases for a separate security check, and, when the itemswere cleared, to carry them aboard as hand baggage.   No major delays were reported because of the increased security.   At London's Heathrow Airport, New York-bound British Airwayspassenger Graham Atkinson from Surrey, south of London, was asked tounpack his suitcase to take out a small transistor radio.   ``I think it is an excellent move,'' he said. ``I go along withany steps being taken to stop the terrorists. Obviously afterLockerbie, you can't be too careful.''   All 259 people on board Pan Am Flight 103 were killed and 11people on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland, died Dec. 21 when abomb blew up the New York-bound jet.   Sheila Dawson from Wimbledon, also bound for New York, said: ``Iwas asked if I had anything electrical in my luggage when I checkedin. In fact I had packed my Walkman in my hand baggage so I was ableto show them straight away.   ``It's frightening to think that a bomb could be hidden insomething as small as that. I agree with the new regulation and Ithink it should be strictly enforced.''   At a Thursday news conference in Lockerbie, detective John Orrsaid investigators believe a radio-cassette player contained theexplosives that blew up Flight 103.   Orr, who is leading the international investigation of the crash,said it appeared likely the explosives were checked in with baggagein Frankfurt before the plane went to London's Heathrow Airport forthe final leg of its trip to New York. But there was not enoughevidence to determine the identity of the bomber, he said.   One group regularly linked to the bombing was Ahmed Jibril'sextremist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-GeneralCommand, a Syrian-sponsored faction outside the Palestine LiberationOrganization.   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said Saturday he would ``punish'' Jibrilif he were responsible, but that no evidence has been found. Arafatsaid he did not think Palestinians were behind the bombing because``no Palestinan can think to do this awful crime.''   Arafat spoke in an interview with CBS television's ``60Minutes.'' A transcript of his remarks was released in advance bythe network.   At a Montreal meeting last week of the International CivilAviation Organization's governing council, Transport Secretary PaulChannon outlined a program to increase airline security, includingchecks on electrical and electronic equipment.   The organization agreed to consider a worldwide tightening ofaviation security rules, including possible restrictions on carryingelectrical and electronic devices on planes.   Britain decided to go ahead with the recommendation withoutwaiting for the international organization to take action, said thetransport spokesman who, in line with British custom, is notidentified by name.</TEXT></DOC>
