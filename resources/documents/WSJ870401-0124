Biltmore Blackman of Billerica, Mass., deducted $97,853 for the fire loss of a former Baltimore home; but the IRS objected after learning how the fire began. Blackman visited the home one 1980 weekend to try to win back his wife, who had left him (they later divorced); but they quarreled repeatedly. When she went out, he piled some of her clothing on the stove and set it afire. The fire spread and destroyed the house. Blackman was charged with arson and put on probation for malicious destruction.    Blackman's insurer rejected his loss claim, as the IRS did his deduction. So he turned to the Tax Court, asserting that he had put out the fire on the stove before departing. Now Judge Simpson has upheld the IRS: Blackman, who admitted starting the fire, was &quot;grossly negligent, or worse&quot;; there was no evidence that he tried to put it out. Also, allowing a deduction would frustrate Maryland's public policies against arson and domestic violence.    &quot;We refuse to encourage couples to settle their disputes with fire,&quot; the judge said.    AMERICANS ABROAD may have lost a due-date delay for estimated taxes.    In the past, U.S. citizens and resident aliens who were outside the U.S. and Puerto Rico on April 15, the first quarterly due date for estimated tax, got an automatic extension to June 15; they then had to pay half the estimated annual sum. The 1984 tax act repealed the basis for the extension, apparently inadvertently. Still, awaiting a possible correction in the 1986 tax act, the IRS granted extensions in 1985 and 1986 to June 15, which also is the due date for tax returns filed from abroad.    But the 1986 act made no change; and so far, the IRS hasn't announced an extension for 1987. Arthur Fisher of Peat Marwick, CPAs, and other tax advisers say IRS rules writers have told them informally not to expect one. A spokesman said the IRS is drafting a statement on the matter, but didn't indicate what will be said. In the meantime, Peat Marwick is advising clients to plan to pay estimated taxes April 15.    PERSONAL-COMPUTER RULES make a casualty of a life-insurance salesman.    Employees may deduct business use of their own computers only if the use is for an employer's convenience and required as an employment condition to do work &quot;properly.&quot; A salesman we'll call Ron says he is being &quot;informally compelled&quot; by his employer to buy a portable unit, only for business, to take into customers' homes to figure policy proposals. The company wants salespeople to take over necessary computer calculations to save time and clerical staff.    Ron's computer will help productivity and benefit his employer; he wants to deduct it. But the IRS, in private ruling 8710009, turns him down: The purchase still is optional; he gave no evidence that those who don't buy would be &quot;professionally disadvantaged.&quot; The computer use, &quot;although work-related, isn't inextricably related to the proper performance&quot; of the job.    Thus, Ron isn't &quot;required&quot; to buy the computer, the IRS concludes.    ADVANCE-TUITION PACTS would offer a double benefit under a bill in the Illinois senate. A contract payment not only would cover a beneficiary's future attendance at an Illinois state college or university but also would be deductible on an Illinois state-income-tax return.    CONFUSION WOULD REIGN if Canada renumbered tax-law sections as part of a proposed consolidation of all statutes, a letter to the Justice Ministry from the Tax Executives Institute suggests. The corporate officials say the expense and burden of revising references would be great.    A GARBAGE DUMP is a depreciating asset, although land as such isn't depreciable for taxes, the Tax Court says. It upheld write-offs by Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. of Houston, a waste-disposal concern, of two landfills as they were used.    IT'S BETTER TO TOE the mark than to drag the feet in filing new W-4 forms.    The IRS prefers to get withholding-tax exemption forms now; but, owing to the fuss over the form, it will waive underwithholding penalties for people who file W-4s by June 1. Trouble is, those who wait may owe a lot at year end, even without penalties, because the form is for figuring tax to be withheld from the start of the year. Most likely to have underpaid are two-earner, middle-income couples with low deductions.    Shortfalls may occur even for those who take no exemptions and have extra tax withheld, says Michael Bell of Ernst andamp; Whinney, CPAs. His example: A couple who take no exemptions have taxable income of $47,480 and a tax liability of $9,715; they file W-4s on June 1 and -- following instructions -- have an extra $150 a month withheld. At year end, they owe $1,033, having paid no extra tax for the first five months.    It is best to file W-4s as soon as possible, then recheck the result with IRS Publication 919, &quot;Is My Withholding Correct?&quot;    BRIEFS: Louisiana will start mailing state refunds tomorrow; shaky finances have delayed them for weeks. . . . Ministers and religious-order members who previously opted out of Social Security now may elect irrevocably to be covered by filing new IRS Form 2031. . . . New IRS reference publications include &quot;Statistics of Income-1984 Individual Income Tax Returns&quot; and &quot;Sole Proprietorships Source Book, 1957-1984.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
