But under Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole the agency has thisyear assumed a high-profile, calming if not quieting its criticswith actions on troublesome issues affecting exposure of workers tothe AIDS virus, hazardous chemicals and repetitive-motion disorders.   Most recently, she has ordered a new rule requiring seat-beltuse on job-related drives, a move she said should significantlyreduce the nearly 2,500 work-related automobile fatalities eachyear _ 37.5 percent of all on-the-job deaths last year.   ``A lot of it will be education,'' she said of the rule, whichshe concedes will be difficult to enforce. ``Getting people in thehabit of using seat belts is the most important thing.''   In an interview Friday, Mrs. Dole refused to respond directly tocriticisms of OSHA during the Reagan administration. But when shespoke of her plans it was clear she does not believe it had beendoing enough.   ``It seems to me that we really need a recommitment to workerhealth and safety,'' she said. ``This has to come from the top. ...We're going to be fair, certainly. But we are going to enforce thelaw.''   Even her critics within the department give high marks to herefforts to promote safety.   In the last six months the agency has:   _Proposed exposure limits for MDA, a chemical widely used inconstruction, that it said would prevent at least 20 cancer deathsa year.   _Fined Lockheed Corp. $1.49 million for safety violations at aCalifornia plant where it makes the B-2 Stealth bomber.   _Fined a Ford Motor Co. subsidiary nearly $2 million forallegedly violating a previous agreement with OSHA.   _Recommended criminal charges against two companies it blamedfor a fatal explosion in a Milwaukee sewer tunnel.   _Ordered 631,000 factories to install locks and otherprotections to guarantee machines stay idle during repairs, a stepdesigned to save 120 lives a year. This rule had been bogged in thebureaucracy for a decade.   _Agreed with Sara Lee Corp. on a plan to protect 8,000 workersin 31 meat-processing plants from injuries blamed on repetitivemotion.   _Fined a Maine paper mill $1.6 million for 531 alleged safetyviolations.   _Issued a proposed rule designed to protect 5.3 million healthcare and rescue workers from exposure to blood and other bodilyfluids potentially infected with the AIDS virus.   _Adopted new standards governing the use of trenches inconstruction that cover 1 million jobsites and are designed toprevent 75 deaths and 3,000 injuries a year.   _Asked Congress for $14.8 million for 179 more inspectors.   Getting the agency involved in preventive efforts is a Dolepriority.   ``In the past OSHA actions have depended on looking at theillness and injury data that is reported to us,'' she said.``That's sort of like closing the barn door after the horse is outof the barn.''   One such effort begins soon within the highly hazardousmeatpacking industry, with nationwide distribution of voluntaryguidelines designed to prevent injuries by recommending redesignedequipment and work spaces and rotation of employees whose jobsrequire using sharp objects and repetitive motion.   OSHA also plans to encourage employers who use hazardouschemicals to study whether they could use safer alternatives thatcost more up front but might actually cost the same or less in thelong run when storage and handling costs are considered.   Mrs. Dole defended the OSHA against criticism that it too oftensettles for greatly reduced fines, saying that in the place ofmoney the agency might accept a promise by a company to improvesafety in all its plants, not just the one cited.   ``It's not just how many dollars you get,'' she said. ``It'sgetting the problem corrected.''</TEXT></DOC>
