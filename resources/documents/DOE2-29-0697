Theresults show that it would be technically feasible to run the Canadianeconomy in 2000 with only 4% more energy than it used in 1978 and todouble the reliance on renewable sources from 16% to 32% during the sameperiod. This scenario assumes strong economic growth and moderate populationgrowth; under more moderate economic growth, it would be feasable touse 22% less secondary energy over the above time period, with 45% ofthat energy provided by renewable sources, assuming a decrease in thereal cost of renewable energy technologies. Other projections were madefor the size of the market for renewable energy, and possible sourcesand uses. The paper then discusses the possible lessons from this earlierstudy. These include the following: there is an important, but very diverse,market for renewable energy; industry has too often overstated the marketpotential, mainly because it has neglected conservation as an alternativeoption; the conservation market, in combination with renewables, willbe an important challenge; the near-term market opportunity for renewablesis limited by inappropriate government policies and by inadequate informationand education; and, environmental attractiveness is an important advantageof renewable energy sources. 4 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
