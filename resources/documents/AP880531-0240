The railway, which has become the centerpiece of President OmarBongo's 20 years in office, runs 396 miles from this Atlantic portnear Libreville through the once-impenetrable Forest of Bees to amining center near Franceville. There it will soon begin regularlyhauling out more manganese, uranium and timber to increase Gabon'sexport revenues.   Full operation of the railroad awaits the expansion of portfacilities in Owendo.   Adding to the prospect of increased exports are the new oildiscoveries.   The outlook now is that Gabon, whose future not long ago hadbeen pictured as gloomy, will be adding to the prosperity that hasraised its annual per capita income to $3,000 _ in contrast to $790in nearby Nigeria, $500 in neighboring Congo, $802 in Cameroon and$310 in the Central African Republic.   Twice in this decade, Gabon's oil reserves were reported to berunning out. But both times fresh discoveries were made.   The second major find, the on-shore Rabi-Kounga field, ``is agiant field ... the biggest in West Africa,'' said David Norman,director of Tenneco's Gabon operations.   Gabon has oil reserves estimated at 1 billion barrels, butNorman predicted they will double.   Production now is 176,000 to 180,000 barrels a day from offshorefields, Norman said. Rabi-Kounga production won't begin before themiddle of 1989, when it is initially expected to provide 80,000barrels daily.   The fall in the price of oil early this decade had left Gabonunable to pay its bills. But Western creditors have rescheduledmuch of its $2 billion-debt until Rabi-Kounga money starts flowing.   At the same time, Bongo slashed government spending by 50percent and cut civil servant salaries. Private employees wererequired to lend the government 3 percent of their salaries over an18-month period.   ``You know how the human situation is,'' said Jean Ping, Bongo'schief of staff. ``Because we had the reputation of being therichest country in Africa, our economic problems received muchattention. But we are still in a very, very good situation when youcompare us with others.''   The country's minimum wage of $200 a month has attracted morethan 180,000 people from other African countries to work in Gabon,which is about the size of Colorado.   The United States looks favorably upon Gabon.   ``Despite current difficulties, Gabon's oil resources, relativeprosperity, economic and political orientation, and good ties withthe United States make it an attractive partner for Americanbusinesses,'' says the latest U.S. Embassy economic report on Gabon.   The new railroad is seen as a boon for exports.   Before the railway, the only transport between Libreville, thecapital, and the mining region was by air. Traveling by car ortruck could take 40 days because roads often are washed out byheavy rains.   The World Bank refused to finance the railway project, whichbegan in 1973, saying it was too difficult, too expensive and wouldnever pay for itself.   Bongo pushed ahead with private financing, and it opened Dec.31, 1986.   Ping said some of the projects undertaken by the government canbe questioned, but not the railway.   ``People sometimes don't understand the importance of therailway,'' he added. ``Before independence (from France in 1960)the country was like three separate bodies. How can you build anation if you don't have the feeling of belonging to a community.Countries start with railways.''   Bongo created a one-party state 20 years ago but Ping said thedecision was the right one.   ``We obliged the president to create a one-party governmentbecause we are building a nation. Our objective was nationalunity,'' he said.   Bongo was 31 years old and the vice president when he moved upto the presidency Nov. 28, 1967, on the death of President LeonM'Ba.   Three months later, Bongo created the Gabon Democratic Party asthe nation's sole political party, on grounds that the previousmultiparty system had resulted in violent political campaigns andone coup attempt that failed only after French intervention.   The U.S. Embassy's Human Rights report on Gabon says thatalthough no criticism of the president is allowed and advocacy of amultiparty state is banned, the president's power is limited by``the diffusion of power through 45 Cabinet level officials. ...This group of 45 includes representatives of all the country'smajor ethnic groups, geographic, and political groups. Through thismechanism, Gabon's varied interest groups are heard, given accessto political patronage, and consulted on national resourcedistribution.''   On May 3, the government television resumed a program in whichCabinet ministers appear weekly and take questions from journalistsand telephone callers.   During a previous run of the show, Bongo himself was known tocall in and ask questions.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs June 8</NOTE></DOC>
