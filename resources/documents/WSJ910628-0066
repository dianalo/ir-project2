A number of the larger suppliers to Columbia Gas indicatethey are unhappy with the company's offer to buy back thecontracts for about 60 cents on the dollar. But they alsoconcede that the threat of a bankruptcy filing may not leavethem with many other options.</LP><TEXT>   The company recently indicated it faced possible lossesexceeding $1 billion on the high-priced contracts andproposed to issue obligations of its pipeline unit to thesuppliers.   Although the company hasn't named the suppliers it isseeking to negotiate with, records at the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission list the company's suppliers by volumeof gas purchased and contract price. A Wall Street Journalsurvey of many higher volume suppliers with contractsexceeding $2 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas foundmost of them anxious to resolve the problems in a verydepressed market. Spot prices have recently been in the $1.20range, although Columbia Gas says some of its contracts areas high as $6.70 a thousand cubic feet.   Analysts say a handful of major oil companies -- notablyExxon Corp. -- will be critical to the success of thenegotiating efforts. By far Columbia's largest supplier,according to the FERC figures, Exxon was paid an averageprice of $2.13 a thousand cubic feet. Exxon declined tocomment on the discussions.   Columbia Gas negotiators are doing their best to make thesituation sound serious. &quot;They said if they're not getting a100% response, or at least a good portion, the deal won'tfly,&quot; said a spokesman at Wainoco Oil Corp., Houston. &quot;Thisisn't the best offer in the world, but it may be better thanus just sitting here.&quot; Last year, Wainoco's price averaged$2.70 per thousand cubic feet.   The majority of suppliers were receiving between $2 and $3for a thousand cubic feet, but some producers receivedsubstantially more. Koch Industries Inc., for example, had anaverage price of $5.50. Officials at Koch, Wichita, Kan.,declined to comment.   While some analysts think Columbia Gas has gone out of itsway to dramatize the price squeeze, &quot;we don't think they'rebluffing,&quot; says a spokesman for Forest Oil Corp., a Denver,Colo., company which sold Columbia natural gas last year for$3.21. &quot;There is some concern about the bankruptcy.&quot;   Columbia Gas's offer &quot;doesn't sound very appealing to me,&quot;said J.P. Bryan, chairman of Torch Energy Advisors Inc., aHouston-based gas investor and well manager and a unit ofTorchmark Corp. &quot;We'd be willing to {reject the offer}, butwe wouldn't want to push any company into bankruptcy. We're asmall enough player that we're not going to be theprecipitating factor.&quot; Last year, Torch price to Columbia was$4.54 a unit.   A Columbia Gas spokesman said the company is in activenegotiations with its suppliers. Most of the contracts atissue are with suppliers in the Southwest.   Some analysts think the company's long-range prospects arebright once the current crisis is resolved. &quot;The threat ofChapter 11 should be effective,&quot; Prudential Securities Inc.analyst David Fleischer wrote in a recent report. &quot;We do notbelieve that Columbia Gas's suppliers will want to becomeembroiled in a bankruptcy workout.&quot;   He thinks the cost of buying out the contracts could beabout $900 million, on a pretax basis, or $12 a share aftertaxes, and projects a 1991 net loss of $10 a share. But witha settlement of the contracts, he sees the company earning $2a share in 1991, down from a previous estimate of $3.   Other analysts aren't as positive. &quot;I find it hard tobelieve that producers are under the gun,&quot; said Joseph M.Egan, analyst at Carl H. Pforzheimer andamp; Co. &quot;Columbia, afterall, is the one that may have to go into bankruptcy. Theproducers hold the cards here, not Columbia.&quot;   The company's other near-term problem is to renegotiateits credit lines with banks led by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.A Columbia Gas spokesman said talks are &quot;ongoing&quot; but addedthere's been no indication of when to expect a response. Thecompany has defaulted on $25 million of short-term debt, andis seeking to renegotiate its $1.25 billion credit line.   Although Columbia's stock and bond prices plummeted afterthe recent announcement, the bonds have recovered a bit,reflecting the conclusion that some debt enjoys a more seniorposition than some of the bank lenders.</TEXT></DOC>
