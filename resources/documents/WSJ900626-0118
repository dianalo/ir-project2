The agency also issued a draft guide to workplace smokingpolicies that recommends that passive smoking be eliminatedwherever possible and measures the effectiveness of variousmethods of reducing worker exposure to smoking. Among itsfindings, the guide, which includes case studies of companiesthat have reduced worker exposure, says that cutting passivesmoking can cut costs.</LP><TEXT>   The proposal, which was expected, would put second-handsmoke in a class with such pollutants as asbestos. The agencyestimates that passive smoke causes 3,800 additional lungcancer deaths annually. These include 2,500 adults who neversmoked and 1,300 former smokers.   The report didn't break new scientific ground and didn'tchronicle the effect of second-hand smoke on other ailmentssuch as heart disease and other forms of cancer, althoughseveral reports recently have linked it to these illnesses.The report did say that absorption of tobacco smoke can beparticularly harmful for children.   The EPA itself can't regulate smoking, but theOccupational Safety and Health Administration is expected touse the report as a means of raising the issue of workplaceexposure. While anti-smoking groups expect the report tobolster their efforts to ban smoking from the workplace, thetobacco industry is also hard at work to thwart such moves.Philip Morris Cos., for example, has been touting studiesthat find exposure to second-hand smoke far less harmful thanthe EPA report states.   In a statement yesterday, the Tobacco Institute said theEPA &quot;has contributed to the speculative process of ascribingrisk where a sound scientific basis is lacking&quot; and predictedthat the risk assessment would result in &quot;fear andconfusion.&quot;   The draft workplace guide states that prohibiting smokingindoors is the best way to reduce exposure but notes thatthis is inconvenient for smokers. To be effective, designatedsmoking areas must have a separate ventilation system so thatair from the room isn't circulated throughout the building,and provide far greater amounts of outdoor air for eachsmoker than offices typically supply.   Two common strategies, separating smokers from nonsmokerswith a wall or within the same room, won't eliminatetobacco-smoke pollution although they can cut exposure,according to the guidebook. The document also says variousdevices used to clean air, including filters and iongenerators, may effectively remove particles found in tobaccosmoke but don't effectively reduce gaseous pollutants.   One strategy that doesn't work particularly well isallowing smokers and nonsmokers to use the same space atdifferent times. The guidelines state that people enteringroom hours after smoking occurred will still be exposed tothe harmful particles and gases found in tobacco smoke.   The guidebook says company smoking policies need thesupport of management and should be developed with employeeand labor union participation. Smoking-cessation programsalso should be made available to smokers who want to quit.   The guidebook, prepared for the EPA by the nonprofitSmoking Policy Institute in Seattle, and the risk-assessmentreport are being released for public comment on theirtechnical and policy contents.</TEXT></DOC>
