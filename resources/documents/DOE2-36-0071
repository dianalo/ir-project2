<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-36-0071 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method is developed to transcribe algebraic models consisting of protonand neutron bosons into geometrical models of proton and neutron liquids.Particular attention is paid to well deformed systems and the preservationof their rotational symmetry. By using an expansion in terms of the inverseof the boson number, rotational and vibrational modes of motion are identified.Properties of the energy spectra in the two descriptions are compared.The consequences of F-spin breaking for the geometrical picture are analysed.</TEXT></DOC>
