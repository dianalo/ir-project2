ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When California voters elect a new governor in1990, they will shape the make-up of the U.S. House for the rest ofthis century as well as the course of the 1992 presidential race.   It's no wonder that Republican Party chairman Lee Atwater hasdeclared that his ``main objective for 1990 is electing Sen. PeteWilson governor of California.''   ``We're prepared to fight them tooth and toenail,'' saidDemocratic Rep. Tony Coelho of California.   Rarely has a single state election had the potential nationalimpact of the contest to succeed Republican George Deukmejian, whoopted against seeking a third term as governor.   The numbers tell part of the story.   Already the nation's most populous state, California now has 45seats in the House and is expected to gain six or seven more afterthe 1990 Census confirms the continuing shift of the nation'spopulation to the Sunbelt.   That means California will have 53 or 54 of the 270 electoralvotes needed to elect a president in 1992. In addition, it islikely that the state will assert its influence on presidentialnominating politics by moving its presidential primary to earlyMarch.   The initial advantage in the high-stakes governor's race went tothe Republicans when they convinced Wilson to run for governor,taking on another multi-million-dollar race just after he won asecond Senate term in 1988.   On the Democratic side, party leaders would like _ without muchrealistic hope _ to avoid a bitter gubernatorial primary betweenstate Attorney General John Van de Kamp and former San FranciscoMayor Dianne Feinstein.   California is a major source of campaign contributions forpoliticians from all regions of the country, but even its politicallargess could be strained in 1992 if Wilson is elected governor.   If that happens, Wilson's appointed successor in the Senatewould have to run in 1992 for the final two years of the term. Andthe seat now held by Democrat Sen. Alan Cranston is up in 1992 aswell.   California fund-raisers shudder at the prospect of two Senateraces during a presidential year in which the state also will havesix new House seats.   The big losers could be the large group of Democratic senatorselected in 1986, when the party regained control of the Senate.Many of those Democrats would like to raise thousands of dollars inCalifornia.   ``It's certainly going to make us much more introspective,''said Steve Moses, a major Democratic fund-raiser in SouthernCalifornia. ``We're all going to be focusing on ourselves. We willnot be as available to others.''   On the other hand, Bob Burkett, an entertainment industryexecutive who also is an active Democratic Party fund raiser, saidthe burst of activity would probably have little impact onCalifornians who regularly give $25,000 a year to politicalcandidates.   ``I keep answering this question, yes,'' said Republicanbusinessman Jack Flanagan when asked if money could grow tighterfor GOP candidates. ``Yet we keep finding new donors.''   While the impact of the governors race on fund-raising isdebatable, there's no question of the redistricting stakes.   In 1981, when new district lines were drawn to conform to the1980 Census, California gained two new U.S. House seats.   The Democrats controlled the legislature and the governor wasEdmund G. Brown Jr., also a Democrat.   The Republicans were on the sidelines as the Democrats rammedthrough a plan _ authored largely by the late Rep. Phil Burton _that was credited with enabling his party to win five seats in the1982 elections.   With California picking up six or seven seats this time, thestakes will be even higher.   The Democrats still control the legislature, but unless they canupset Wilson, they'll have to reach a compromise with the governor.   ``If we win the governor's race _ and I think it's verydoable,'' said Coelho, ``then we have the legislature and thegovernor and we go ahead and have a very smooth reapportionmentfrom our point of view.''   The congressman predicted that a Republican governor would balkat any compromise with the legislature. Then the issue would bedecided by the courts, where many of the judges were appointed byRonald Reagan.   ``They would do basically a Republican plan,'' Coelho said ofthe courts.   Should the GOP come out way ahead in California and also pick upseats in states like Texas and Florida _ which also have Republicangovernors _ Coelho said it would ``have an impact on nationallegislation.''   ``Say we lose ten Democrats. You could have an impact on everybill we got through in the 87-88 year because we barely got a lotof them through,'' said Coelho who was the chief Democraticvote-counter in the last Congress.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 11</NOTE></DOC>
