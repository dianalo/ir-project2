<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-85-0121 </DOCNO><TEXT>For more than thirty years, the Illinois State Water Survey (ISWS) hasapplied carbon dioxide to potable water systems for control of calciumcarbonate and magnesium hydroxide deposition and to remove the depositionproducts from the systems. This paper presents unpublished results ofISWS field studies using this technology which were carried out in Stateof Illinois facilities. Carbon dioxide was applied to the hot water distributionsystems of buildings while in service. Mineral deposits were removedwithout detrimental effects to equipment or occupants. The procedureis economically feasible whenever deposits are sufficiently severe tocause loss of capacity to an extent that piping replacement is considered.Methods for monitoring and applying carbon dioxide are described.</TEXT></DOC>
