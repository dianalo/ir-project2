Sitting in the dim light with several colleagues, &quot;justlooking into ourselves,&quot; the 29-year-old Lockheed Corp.employee strapped his gas mask on tight and wondered: &quot;Isthis really the right place for a civilian?&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Maybe not. But several hundred defense industry workersvolunteered to participate in Desert Storm for the thrill ofit, the rare chance to see their deadly products perform --and the chance to make fatter paychecks. While the troopswere shooting, these representatives from the corporate worldwere trouble-shooting, making sure the weapons they builtperformed as advertised. Many remain in the Persian Gulf,helping the military to pack up.   For Mr. Pupkiewicz, who works for Lockheed's Sanderselectronics division, it has been an assignment bothexhausting and exhilarating. From 6 a.m. to 9 p.m., virtuallyevery day through the air war, he stood along the noisyflight line at the Marine air base, advising militarymaintenance personnel as they fixed radar-jammingcountermeasures on F/A-18 and A-6 warplanes. &quot;I was in shockfor the first few days, seeing the amount of work there wasto do,&quot; says Mr. Pupkiewicz, who like other company types ismore used to punching in at 9 a.m. and out at 5 p.m.   Then came the long drive home at night. For 40 milesthrough the desert, he'd make the trek in his compact car tothe Holiday Inn in Manama. It wasn't easy to sleep, however.The hotel's air-raid alarm was tough to hear, so Mr.Pupkiewicz kept the television on, blasting out CNN newsreports that might give him better information about anyIraqi Scud missile attacks. He and other tech reps, asthey're called, also received threatening phone calls in themiddle of the night. One man would yell in broken English,&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;   What indeed? From the moment forces were deployed to thePersian Gulf last summer, company executives had to grapplewith whether their employees should go along. &quot;We have acontractual obligation as well as a moral obligation&quot; tooffer field support to the Pentagon, says D. KennethRichardson, the president of General Motors Corp.'s HughesAircraft subsidiary, which sent 36 employees to the region.But he also acknowledges a responsibility to keep hiscivilian work force out of harm's way and, he concedes, &quot;it'snot easy to know when&quot; to pull back.   Company officials point out that they've played a key roleon every major battlefield U.S. forces have stalked sinceWorld War II. Mr. Richardson himself ventured to the Gulf ofTonkin during Vietnam to learn more about how missilesoperate in combat. The same plane that carried him off thecarrier Kittyhawk went down the next week, and everyoneaboard was lost. &quot;It's not a game out there,&quot; he says.   Despite such dangers, the tech reps of Desert Storm saythey're glad they played a part in the war. For some, it wasa way to watch their oft-maligned equipment prove itself inaction. &quot;It gets personal when you dedicate a good part ofyour life to a product and you hear all that criticism,&quot; saysDan Masquelier, a seven-year McDonnell Douglas Corp. veteranwho went to Saudi Arabia to help with the company's Apacheattack helicopters. The chopper, which has been haunted by areputation for poor reliability, performed well in thePersian Gulf, destroying scores of Iraqi tanks.   The war was also a way for the reps to prove themselves.Enlisted men and women often &quot;have the perception that wemake a lot of money&quot; without having to endure the hardshipsof military life, says Mr. Pupkiewicz, who is normallystationed with a Marine unit in Kaneohe, Hawaii.   &quot;A lot of us get tired of hearing that,&quot; he adds. &quot;Nowthey've gained a lot more respect for us.&quot;   Tech reps in the Persian Gulf ate the same chow as thetroops, and many dressed in Air Force flight suits or Armycamouflage fatigues. As a result, most tech reps looked liketheir counterparts in the service, save for their longerhair.   Most important, bullets and missiles don't discriminatebetween soldiers and civilians.   That was particularly worrisome for the tech reps ofGeneral Dynamics Corp. They went to the Gulf to help maintainM-1 tanks and German-built Fox Desert Vehicles, which testedsoil and air samples along the front for chemical andbiological agents. The Fox, which General Dynamics will startbuilding for the U.S. Army by 1994, looks like theSoviet-made armored personnel carriers used by the Iraqis --except for two additional tires in the back. Meanwhile,allied patrols were on alert for terrorists driving around inwhite Toyota pickups -- the very trucks that General Dynamicsemployees were assigned to use. No General Dynamics officialswere shot at, though they were routinely scrutinized by U.S.helicopters as they tried to find their way through thefeatureless desert. &quot;That got a little spooky,&quot; says BruceMason, who worked on Foxes along the Iraqi border.   Perhaps the closest call of all came for Tom Stanley andothers from McDonnell Douglas's helicopter division who onFeb. 25 were gathered at an office the company had rented inDhahran, Saudi Arabia. Mr. Stanley had just gotten off thephone with his son back in Texas, wishing him a happy eighthbirthday, when a Scud missile came in. &quot;It just rocked thisplace,&quot; he remembers. A military barracks only a block awayhad been hit by the missile, killing 28 American soldiers.   Because many tech reps have themselves served in the armedforces, some tried to comfort the young soldiers girding forbattle. &quot;I told them that nothing was going to happen theycouldn't overcome,&quot; says Ron Hairston, 49, who was a prisonerof war in Vietnam. He joined General Dynamics last year afterthree decades in the Marines.   Dale Burton, of Grumman Corp., flew aboard J-Stars, anelectronics-laden plane that, although it is still underdevelopment, was dispatched to the Persian Gulf to detect theenemy's ground movements. Mr. Burton once was able to pickout on a monitor a cluster of Iraqi vehicles an Air Forceoperator had overlooked; U.S. aircraft were quicklydispatched, destroying 29 of the 40 armored cars. The colonelin charge of J-Stars labeled the mission &quot;Burton's Folly,&quot;which is pretty thrilling for a guy with a Ph.D. in appliedmathematics.   Many tech reps took on less high-profile, but nonethelessimportant, tasks. Richard Jay, an F-15 weapons expert forMcDonnell Douglas, was for a time the only one at a secretSaudi air base allowed to come and go because of securityrestrictions placed on Air Force personnel. When the laundryfacilities went down, a colonel dispatched him across thedesert to Riyadh in pursuit of 400 clean T-shirts. Mr. Jayaccomplished his mission.   For their efforts, the tech reps will be well compensated.Company executives say employees in the Persian Gulf candouble their salaries, once overtime, foreign service pay andcombat-zone compensation is thrown in.   Still, one wag from Hughes, as part of his weekly fieldreport faxed back to the company's Los Angeles headquarters,couldn't help but wonder &quot;how sandbag duty and bunkerbuilding will be counted in next year's round&quot; of salaryreviews.</TEXT></DOC>
