Four rail-transit systems were selectedto examine energy-related data and policies, to simulate the energy-usepattern, and to develop more-general guidelines for energy managementin rail transit. Estimates of overall costs and effectiveness of load-managementmethodologies were made. The cost and benefit of load management is extremelysite-specific. A series of guidelines that define an overall transitenergy-management program were developed as part of the report.</TEXT></DOC>
