Reliance Financial added in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it asked federal antitrust regulators for clearance to boost its 12.8% stake to as much as 24.9% of the common outstanding, should it decide to do so.    Reliance Financial is a unit of Reliance Group Holdings Inc., controlled by Saul Steinberg, the New York investor. Spectra-Physics, a San Jose, Calif., laser and laser-related products maker, had no comment.    Spectra-Physics shares rose $2.375, to $24.375, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    In the filing, Reliance Financial said it opposes a group of proposals management outlined in a proxy statement for the Jan. 28 annual meeting. The proposals are against holders' best interests and &quot;could create barriers which would chill any potential auction process&quot; for the company, the filing said.    Reliance Financial said in the filing that to protect its investment, it is weighing moves including seeking board seats or obtaining control through a tender offer or additional share purchases. It hasn't decided on a specific course of action, however. Reliance Financial also said it may evaluate other ways to maximize shareholder value, including selling or spinning off certain less-profitable Spectra-Physics assets, the filing said.    Reliance Financial controls 965,200 Spectra-Physics common shares. The company increased its common shares outstanding to 7,521,798 as of Dec. 12, the filing said.    In the year ended Sept. 30, Spectra-Physics earned $848,000, or 11 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $2.5 million. Revenue rose 10% to $210.1 million. </TEXT></DOC>
