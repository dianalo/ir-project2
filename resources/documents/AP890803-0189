Police found the ivory in the Cape Town home of Michael Shen, a37-year-old Taiwanese citizen who has lived in South Africa for thepast nine years. Shen and an unspecified number of other men werearrested Wednesday, police said.   It was not immediately clear whether the tusks came fromelephants in South Africa or elsewhere on the continent, policesaid. One rhino horn also was confiscated, they said.   South Africa's well-managed wildlife parks have few reportedincidents of poaching, but conservationists say the country is amajor transit point for smugglers in other parts of Africa.   The African elephant population has fallen from about 1.5million in 1978 to as few as 400,000 today, mostly because ofpoachers who seek the valuable tusks.   Several Western nations, including the United States, havebanned the import of ivory in recent months. The 102-nationConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species willconsider a worldwide ban on the ivory trade in October.</TEXT></DOC>
