Ahmanson andamp; Co., parent of the nation's second-largest thrift, agreed to acquire the once-troubled Bowery Savings Bank of New York for $200 million.    The acquisition, which is subject to various regulatory clearances, will allow Ahmanson to greatly enlarge the push into New York state that it began three years ago with the acquisition of a failed Long Island thrift.    Bowery, with assets of $6.7 billion and deposits of $5.1 billion, operates 25 branches, mostly in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. Currently, Ahmanson operates 18 branches on Long Island under the name Savings of America and also has four mortgage-origination offices in the New York area.    The acquisition, which isn't expected to close until early next year, could regain for Ahmanson its former position as the nation's largest thrift concern. Ahmanson and Bowery would have combined assets of about $34 billion, approximately the same as Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. of America, currently the nation's largest thrift company.    Bowery's owners, who include noted investors Lawrence Tisch and Warren Buffett, will double the $100 million investment they made in 1985 when they took over the troubled thrift in an agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.    Other principal owners of Bowery include venture capital funds managed by the New York securities firms of E.M. Warburg, Pincus andamp; Co. and Dillon Read andamp; Co., a unit of Travelers Corp. The two funds, together with members of the Tisch family and Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. own about 90% of Bowery's shares. Berkshire Hathaway invested $21.4 million in Bowery. The size of the other stakes hasn't been disclosed.    Ahmanson, whose principal subsidiary is Home Savings of America, said it wants to operate Bowery as a separate unit, with deposits insured by the FDIC. Richard Ravitch, chairman of Bowery, said Ahmanson also wants to merge its Long Island branches into Bowery if regulators approve. Bowery probably will be renamed Bowery Savings of America.    Maintaining Bowery as an FDIC-insured thrift would lock in a cost savings for Ahmanson. Thrifts with deposit insurance provided by the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp., such as Home Savings, must pay annual premiums that are about 2.5 times the premiums paid by FDIC-insured banks and thrifts.    Analysts said the acquisition may indicate a greater aggressiveness on the part of Ahmanson, which is often viewed as a strongly capitalized institution run by a very traditional and conservative management.    &quot;I think it suggests that Ahmanson is being more aggressive in terms of its expansion,&quot; said Jerome I. Baron, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. He said the move is positive for Ahmanson, partly because it will provide an additional source of relatively low-cost retail deposits to fund Ahmanson's booming origination of adjustable-rate mortgages.    Ahmanson is alone among major thrifts in its refusal to originate fixed-rate mortgages. Ahmanson makes only adjustable-rate loans, which currently offer introductory rates almost four percentage points lower than comparable fixed-rate loans.    An Ahmanson spokeswoman said that currently New York ranks third in mortgage-origination volume within the company, after California and Florida. She said the company originated $300 million of mortgages in New York during the first seven months of this year, compared with $38 million a year earlier.    Bowery currently has net worth, or assets minus liabilities, of $147 million, Mr. Ravitch said. He said the savings bank has produced $80 million of profit since its current owners took control in 1985. Previously, Bowery had been owned by its depositors.    Bowery's troubles stemmed from a mismatch between short-term deposits, whose cost rose rapidly in the early 1980s, and long-term fixed-rate mortgages. When the Tisch-Buffett investor group took control of Bowery, the FDIC agreed to reimburse Bowery if interest rates rose, while Bowery would pay the FDIC if rates fell.    Currently, Bowery is paying the FDIC, and paid $3.5 million in the second quarter. The agreement, which has 13 years left to run, would be assumed by Ahmanson, Mr. Ravitch said.    Ahmanson said the acquisition isn't expected to dilute its earnings. A spokeswoman for Ahmanson said the purchase is expected to add about $150 million of goodwill to its books if interest rates remain stable.    The agreement was announced after the stock market closed yesterday. Ahmanson's common closed at $20.75, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Mr. Ravitch, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York, said he plans to leave Bowery after the acquisition is completed. </TEXT></DOC>
