P. Scherer Corp.'s largest shareholder has asked the company for a list of its other stock owners and has indicated she could launch a proxy contest in connection with the Aug. 17 annual meeting.    Karla Scherer Fink, the daughter of R. P. Scherer's founder and a director who controls 33% of the pharmaceutical company's total voting power, has said she wants to find a buyer for R. P. Scherer. She and her brother, John Scherer, who also is a director and controls about 5% of the company's voting power, have retained investment banker Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. to help in the sale.    Their fellow directors have twice rejected the proposal to sell the company. Led by Peter R. Fink, R. P. Scherer's president and chief executive officer and Mrs. Fink's husband, the other board members have maintained that the company should remain independent. Partly as a result of Mr. Fink's resistance to her efforts to liquidate her stock, Mrs. Fink has filed suit to end their 30-year marriage.    In a letter to her husband and W. Merritt Jones Jr., R. P. Scherer's general counsel and Mr. Fink's brother-in-law, Mrs. Fink asked that her attorneys be given the names, addresses and number of shares owned or controlled by all the company's stockholders. She also asked for copies of all stock-transfer sheets issued by the day of the annual meeting.    In the letter, she said she wants to &quot;identify shareholders in order to encourage&quot; them to support her proposal to sell the company, &quot;and to enable me to solicit their proxies in the event I determine to conduct a proxy contest&quot; at the meeting.    One group of shareholders has said in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it is &quot;generally supportive&quot; of Mrs. Fink's efforts. Cilluffo Associates and Bessemer Securities Corp., both New York investment firms, have about 10% of R. P. Scherer's 6.9 million common shares outstanding, but because they don't own any of the company's Class B stock, which carries extra voting weight, they control only about 2.5% of R. P. Scherer's total voting power.    An R. P. Scherer spokeswoman said the company received Mrs. Fink's letter and &quot;turned it over to our legal counsel, who are reviewing it.&quot; She added that the company has &quot;nothing more to say at this time.&quot;    Three of the company's 11 directors are up for re-election at the annual meeting: Peter Dow, president and chief operating officer of the advertising agency Campbell-Ewald Co.; John Scherer and Richard A. Manoogian, chairman of Masco Corp. and R. P. Scherer's second-largest shareholder. He controls an estimated 15% of the company's total voting power and has joined most of the other board members in voting against Mrs. Fink's proposal to sell the company. </TEXT></DOC>
