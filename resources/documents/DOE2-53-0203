<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-53-0203 </DOCNO><TEXT>A computerized search and sort program has been devised to search availablebinary phase diagram data for prescribed features of interest. Data fromthe compilations of Hansen, Elliott, Shunk, and Moffatt are summarizedin a computerized format for easy retrieval. The program is written inthe BASIC language for the IBM PC and compatibles. The database containsinformation on over 2410 binary systems between 75 elements. A subsequentsort program sorts the information first by diagram type and then alphabeticallywithin each type. The program is useful for conducting searches of binaryphase diagram data for the solution of engineering problems involvingbinary phase diagrams. Searches can be conducted according to diagramfeatures such as type of diagram, number of eutectics, composition ortemperature of the lowest melting eutectic, intermediate phases, andthe composition or temperature of the maximum amount of terminal solidsolubility. A description of the program is presented and examples ofits application are discussed. The types of data in the database aredescribed. 6 refs., 4 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
