With Democrats in Congress pushing an ambitious package ofdomestic programs the new administration opposes, both sides of theminimum-wage fight view this first confrontation as a major test ofresolve.   ``If the president gets rolled on the minimum wage then we willsee a plethora of big and bigger spending programs at a time in ourcountry's history when we can least afford it,'' said RepublicanSen. Orrin Hatch of Utah.   ``What George Bush has done here is he's chosen this issue tomake a stand,'' Hatch said in an interview Friday. ``This is a bigstakes game.''   Democrats see it that way was well.   ``We're going to battle on this issue until we get it done, andwe're going to be successful,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,D-Mass. ``The minimum wage has helped get a lot of Democratselected over the years and contributed to the defeat of a lot ofRepublicans. This is a classic confrontation between Democrats as aparty which cares for working people and Republicans who don't.''   Republicans concede Democrats may win a political issue if thepresident vetos legislation raising the minimum wage.   Democrats and organized labor are preparing to promote the issueas one of fairness in the mold of their successful campaign lastyear to win public support for legislation giving workers advancenotice of plant closings.   They also are quick to talk about Bush's support for reducingcapital gains taxes, which would predominantly benefit the wealthy.   ``The president wants thousands of dollars in capital gainstaxes for the rich but he can't spare three dimes for the workingpoor,'' said Kennedy. ``That will linger.''   But Bush, who lost the John Tower nomination fight in theSenate, appears ready to ignore the potential political risk inorder to notch a victory.   Thirty cents and four months separate the Democrats and Bush onthe minimum wage, which has been $3.35 an hour since 1981. Thelegislation soon to reach the White House would raise the floor to$4.55 an hour by October 1991 and allow some workers to be paid asubminimum their first two months on the job. Bush has insisted hewill go no higher then $4.25 an hour and only if employers can paya subminimum for six months.   Bush himself has acknowledged the significance of the battle,ending a recent statement of his intention to veto the Democrats'minimum wage bill with the declaration: ``I have too much atstake.''   Democrats say Bush has picked the wrong time for a fight.   ``Public opinion is overwhelmingly on our side and every sectionof the country understands the economic justice of our position,''said Kennedy. ``It amazes me that the President Bush let himself betrapped by the right wing of his party into making these vetothreats.''   Yet it is Kennedy and fellow Democrats who set the agenda onCapitol Hill, and they chose to tackle the minimum wage firstbefore moving on to other items on a lengthy domestic agenda thatincludes legislation governing parental leave, child care, healthcare and other issues on which the Congress and White House havemajor differences.   ``They're picking the fight because they see a politicalwinner,'' said Hatch. ``They're trying to stick it to him. Thepresident has to assert himself now.''   Kennedy concedes Bush now has the votes to sustain a vetoalthough he said he was ``not prepared to say this fight isn'twinnable.''   Labor's top lobbyist joined Kennedy in promising politicaltroubles to those who side with Bush.   ``The people who are stopping the increase will have to face thepolitical consequences,'' said the AFL-CIO's Robert McGlotten.   The outcome of the fight ``certainly will dictate the directionof the 101st Congress,'' said McGlotten. ``And because of that, atthe White House they think they have to draw the line on the firstbill.''   McGlotten said he expects a Bush veto but added, ``Everytime Isay that I remember Ronald Reagan said `never' on plant closing andnow we have a law.''   Then-Vice President Bush took heat during his presidentialcampaign when Reagan vetoed the plant-closing bill and, whenCongress passed it again, Bush reportedly urged Reagan not to vetoit again.   Hatch said those election-year pressures are missing this timeand that Bush would lose stature if he gave in on the minimum wage.   ``He needs to send a message that he is strong enough to use hisveto power and that he is not going to be pushed just because theremay or may not be a political advantage to the Democrats,'' saidHatch.</TEXT></DOC>
