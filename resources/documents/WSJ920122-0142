Some top executives look either prescient orextraordinarily lucky in the timing of purchases or sales oftheir own companies' stock last year. With all the insiderfilings for 1991 now in at the Securities and ExchangeCommission, it appears that investors who followed the leadof these executives got some profitable tips.</LP><TEXT>   Among the fortunate stock-timers: Joseph Antonini,president of Kmart Corp. and William Anders, chairman ofGeneral Dynamics Corp., both of whom saw double-digit gainsin their companies' stock prices after they bought shares.   Ronald Jackson, chairman and president of DuracellInternational Inc., and Ronald Kidder, chief executiveofficer of Fisher-Price Inc., bought big when their companieswent public. The stock prices of their firms have doubledsince the IPOs.   On the sell side, Compaq Computer Corp.'s Joseph &quot;Rob&quot;Canion, a founder and the company's president until hisouster last October, missed his company's stock slide byselling at an opportune time, SEC filings show. So didGeneral Motors Corp. Chairman Robert Stempel and formerchairman, Roger Smith.   Kmart's Mr. Antonini has made a paper profit of about$100,400 since he bought the company's shares nine monthsago. The chairman and president of the Troy, Mich., retailerpaid $582,350 for 14,000 shares in April, SEC filings show.The purchase was Mr. Antonini's biggest purchase of companystock ever and his first purchase since 1987, according tothe filings.   The stock closed yesterday at $49.25, up from the $41.63that he paid for most of his shares.   Mr. Antonini said his purchase was a bet that thecompany's mammoth modernization program, which has so farexpanded, relocated or refurbished 730 of its 2,300 stores,would result in higher sales. So far, it has paid off, hesaid. The firm's same-store December sales rose 4.6% over1990, higher than the troubled retailing industry as a whole,and January sales are running about 6% above January 1991, hesaid.   But, given the increase, is there any steam left in Kmartstock? Mr. Antonini said he's betting that &quot;the sales trendwill continue the momentum in the stock price.&quot;   General Motors stock, on the other hand, has taken a hitthis year on poor auto sales in general and particularly onthe company's announcement Dec. 18 that it will close 21plants over the next four years. While GM shares traded inthe $37-to-$42 range for much of last year, it hit a low of$26.34 in December and has since rebounded somewhat, closingyesterday in New York Stock Exchange trading at $32.75.   GM's Mr. Stempel sold 12,800 shares at $40.88 a share inAugust, for a total of $523,264, SEC filings show. And hewasn't alone. Insider selling in GM stock was strong enoughto merit three mentions in this column in 1991, the onlystock to be featured that frequently.   SEC filings show five other GM insiders sold shares inAugust or late July. And, in May, former chairman RogerSmith, now a director of GM, sold 17,000 shares for $711,960,or $41.88 a share.   A GM spokesman said the insider selling was bunched upinto a few months because company executives were asked notto sell shares early in the year and in the fourth quarterbecause of potentially market-moving announcements by thecompany.   The spokesman also pointed out that Mr. Stempel and otherexecutives didn't receive normal stock bonuses for 1990. As aresult, he said, some GM officers may be selling previouslyearned stock to make up for lost income.   General Dynamics Chairman William Anders paid $25 each for10,000 shares of the defense contractor in February and about$39 each for 5,000 shares in May, SEC filings show. Severalother General Dynamics insiders also bought shares of theFalls Church, Va., company last year. The stock, boosted by abroader rally in the defense sector, closed yesterday at$60.25 on the Big Board.   Two of the biggest insider success stories of 1991involved companies that went public last year. Insiders,particularly venture capitalists who help launch a company,often use an IPO as an opportunity to sell stock. But, thattrend reversed in 1991: With a slew of IPOs on the market,company executives said institutional investors wanted to seemanagement risk its own money on the new ventures.   And, while its normal for IPOs to have an initial run-upin price, and then give back some or much of those gains,Duracell and Fisher-Price were hugely profitable purchasesfor their executives.   Eight officers and directors of Fisher-Price purchased itsshares on the open market when the toy company was spun offfrom Quaker Oats Co. in July, SEC filings show. The largestpurchase at the East Aurora, N.Y., manufacturer of preschooltoys was made by Chairman Ronald Jackson. He bought 5,500shares for $126,965 in two separate purchases in July.Altogether, the eight insiders spent $414,656 on 17,600Fisher-Price shares, the filings show.   The insiders paid an average price of $23.56 a share.Yesterday, Fisher-Price closed on the Big Board at $39.375.   At Duracell, eight insiders bought stock in the batterymanufacturer as part of its May 2 initial public offering orshortly afterward, SEC filings show. In total, they bought576,050 shares for about $8.6 million, according to thefilings. The purchases included a 50,000-share purchase onMay 8 by company chairman and president Robert C. Kidder. Hepaid the IPO price of $15 a share, SEC filings show.   Mr. Kidder said he bought the Duracell stock &quot;todemonstrate my confidence in the future of the company&quot; andthe purchase &quot;wasn't intended to take advantage&quot; of anyshort-term run-up in the stock. He called Duracell &quot;a growthinvestment over a five-year period.&quot; In that time frame, hesaid, there will probably be small growth in the company'score battery business and an expansion into internationalmarkets and new markets such as powering notebook computersand cellular phones.   The stock of the Bethel, Conn., company has risen sharplysince. In Big Board trading yesterday, Duracell shares closedat $31.25.   Compaq Computer Corp. is a former Wall Street darling thatwas trading as high as $70 a year ago. But the stock plungedlast fall after the computer maker found itself in a costlyprice war with competitors. It hit a low of about $22.25 inNovember, and has since rebounded, closing at $31.875 innational over-the-counter trading yesterday.   Joseph Canion, who at the time was the company'spresident, sold 140,000 shares for about $70 each inFebruary, or a total of $9.8 million, according to SECfilings. And he was only one of several Compaq executives tolighten their Compaq holdings in February.   Mr. Canion was ousted by Compaq's board in a managementshake-up last October.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          DURACELL INTERNATIONAL Inc.'s chairman and president is C.Robert Kidder.
