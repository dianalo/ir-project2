This was Archie and theMeathead, yelling about civil rights, Vietnam, and just abouteverything else.   In following seasons, Mr. Lear maintained his acerbic edgewith &quot;Maude,&quot; &quot;The Jeffersons,&quot; &quot;Sanford and Son,&quot; &quot;MaryHartman, Mary Hartman,&quot; and &quot;Fernwood 2Night.&quot; Then, 12 yearsago, he burned out, and gave up television. This week, NormanLear returns to the sofa where he belongs, with a new sitcom.</LP><TEXT>   Over the decades, Mr. Lear's shows rarely shied away fromtalking frankly about the most sensitive of topics --menopause, impotence, bigotry, homosexuality, even politics.But now, with his new series, &quot;Sunday Dinner&quot; (CBS, Sundays,8 p.m. EDT), Mr. Lear takes on television's most sensitivetopic of all -- religion.   There is a certain irony here. Mr. Lear has spent most ofthe intervening years as a champion of liberal causes,creating People for the American Way to combat the influenceof the Moral Majority. Now he returns to TV after all thistime with a program that espouses a belief in God and oldfashioned values. The title song says it all: &quot;Love begins athome with the family.&quot;   Is this a conversion? Not really. Much to his credit, Mr.Lear likes to stir up trouble, and if the hawk/dove,liberal/conservative rifts were where the action was back in1971, he believes that looking for the meaning of life afterthe materialistic '80s is the new hot button to push.   In &quot;Sunday Dinner,&quot; the trademark yelling certainly hasn'tstopped. There are just as many raised voices here as on theset of &quot;All in the Family.&quot; Come to think of it, this setlooks almost identical to the old &quot;All in the Family&quot; set.Only this time, they're yelling about something new.   Ben Benedict (the always watchable Robert Loggia) is alovable crusty Long Island printing plant owner who bringshome a fiancee almost half his age. The grown-up kids arenone too thrilled to &quot;share our dad with someone we mighthave gone to camp with.&quot; When the whole extended family getstogether every Sunday for dinner at five, it's generally onelong food fight.   This may be a bit autobiographical, since Norman Learhimself recently divorced his longtime wife and married awoman 25 years his junior. He himself has recently becomeinterested in the spiritual. And he's met with just about thesame reaction from his family.   The kids here are a mixed bunch. There's Vicky (MarthaGehman), the eldest, a prissy, sharp-tongued biologist who'sfinishing up her degree. She can't stand their new mom-to-be:&quot;She's trouble with a capital T and that rhymes with B andthat stands for bimbo.&quot; Diana (Kari Lizer) is Vicky'snone-too-bright sister, a new age fadist who's constantlysearching for an answer, but can't really quite figure outthe question. She's on a mucus-free diet: &quot;My psychic told meto cleanse myself after that incense poisoning with Karl theKrishna.&quot;   And finally there's their brother, Kenneth (PatrickBreen), a wonderful character full of malaprops and misguidednotions to strike it rich. &quot;I've got this gimmick that'llstand the world of wrestling on its rear]&quot; Between hissinging wrestler (Killer Caruso) and his &quot;two words that willchange {the} world -- worm farming,&quot; this is one characterthat deserves his own spin-off show immediately. &quot;Ah-hah,&quot; hesays, walking in the front door. &quot;It's the return of thepractical son]&quot;   At the center of this sitcom is T.T. Fagori (TeriHatcher), the fiancee, a young woman &quot;with a physique like ashipment of bricks.&quot; She's our heroine. And she's not onlydelightful to look at, she's also a lawyer -- anenvironmental lawyer. On top of all that, she has a directtie-line to God.   One show starts with her sitting on her fire escape. Justyour typical New York lawyer, looking up at the sky,launching into a monologue. &quot;Morning, chief,&quot; she says. &quot;Howdoes anyone wake up on a morning like this and not believe insome version of you? No matter what's going on in the world,I think it has such a great personality. I know we haveearthquakes and typhoons and famines and floods. And there'sall the man-made tragedies -- crime, drugs, murder, war. Butthen there's all the zillions of miracles that make up life:the night, the day, the oceans, the sky, the planet, all theplanets, the universe. . . .&quot;   Space, the final frontier.   The problem isn't that &quot;Sunday Dinner&quot; tackles thespiritual. The problem isn't even that the main charactertalks to God, and calls him &quot;chief.&quot; The problem is that thisis sit-com religion, a fuzzy warm touchy-feely creed, andthat T.T. is a space cadet. Most people talk to God longdistance. For her, it's a local call.   What set &quot;All in the Family&quot; apart was that it was the onesitcom that was never afraid to tackle issues, deep, painfulissues. Here, it looks as if they're tackling the deepest ofall, but they're really only pretending. In one episode, forexample, T.T. and the best friend of Ben's first wife arehaving a bitter argument. Then they discover that they bothtalk to God. They become best buddies.   Norman Lear does have a track record of producing winners.With &quot;Sunday Dinner,&quot; he may yet have the potential for one.There are plenty of acerbic characters, plenty of snide andtelling remarks at the May/October relationship, and aglimmer of intelligent discussion about issues such as theenvironment and treatment of animals. Further shows mayexpand in this direction. That would make this &quot;Dinner,&quot; inKenneth's words, &quot;a consomme devoutly to be wished.&quot;   But right now, &quot;Sunday Dinner&quot; plays like the invention ofa bunch of Hollywood granola-heads who think they're talkingto the Big Man on the cellular phone, when they've only gothis answering service.</TEXT></DOC>
