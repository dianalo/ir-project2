The researchers said they had taken laboratory-grown cellsthat already had been genetically engineered to make humaninsulin and further altered the cells so that they willsecrete the insulin only when the body needs it. The cellsthus mimic the cells in the pancreas gland that begin to pourout insulin only when the amount of glucose sugar in theblood stream rises above a certain level. The insulinregulates the conversion of the glucose to energy.</LP><TEXT>   Diabetes is the result of an insufficient or defectivesupply of insulin from the pancreas gland allowing too muchglucose to accumulate in the bloodstream. The type ofdiabetes that must be treated with injections of insulinseveral times a day -- insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus --afflicts an estimated one million Americans.   The Texas advance, which the University of TexasSouthwestern Medical Center has patented and is makingavailable for licensing, promises to overcome a majorstumbling block to an artificial pancreas now underdevelopment. The artificial pancreas consists ofinsulin-producing beta cells extracted from an animalpancreas gland and encapsulated in an inch-long, wire-thinplastic cylinder. The hope is that the tiny plastic capsulewill protect the beta cells from being rejected and destroyedby a diabetic patient's immune system when it is implanted.   Successful animal tests of such miniature artificialpancreases were reported last month by two different researchteams, one at Washington University in St. Louis, workingwith CytoTherapeutics Inc. of Providence, R.I., and the otherat BioHybrid Technologies Inc. of Shrewsbury, Mass., whichuses a plastic developed with W.R. Grace andamp; Co.   A potential roadblock to the artificial pancreas, however,is a source of beta cells sufficient to meet the needs of amillion diabetics. Until now, it has been thought that betacells must be used because they have a built-in monitoringand feedback mechanism that secretes insulin only whenneeded. The plastic capsule would permit beta cells fromcattle or pigs to be used but it would require severalanimals to supply enough beta cells for one person. Moreover,the process for extracting the beta cells from an animalpancreas is complex and expensive.   The Texas researchers believe they have found a way tosolve this supply problem, said the team leader, ChristopherNewgard, assistant professor of biochemistry at theuniversity medical center. The researchers describe theiradvance in this week's issue of the Proceedings of theNational Academy of Sciences.   The researchers reported they use a line of cells that canbe cultured in the test tube and thus is amenable to massproduction. The cells were originally derived from thepituitary gland of a mouse. Since the pituitary gland, likethe pancreas, is a hormone-producing gland the pituitarycells have the necessary machinery for making and secretinghormones like insulin, Dr. Newgard explained.   The mouse pituitary cells were genetically engineered in1983 to make human insulin by Regis Kelly and colleagues atthe University of California, San Francisco. Unlike betacells, however, the modified mouse cells don't turn theirinsulin production on and off in response to blood sugarlevels. Dr. Kelly, who didn't patent the cell line, gave someof them to the Texas team, Dr. Newgard said.   The Texas scientists said they found that the reason themouse cells didn't respond to blood glucose levels was thatthey lacked a gene that let glucose from the passing bloodseep into the cell. The researcher reported they have nowinserted the gene, called the GLUT-2 gene, which lets glucoseseep into the cell and trigger the secretion of insulin. Themouse cells thus mimic the beta cells of the pancreas inregulating insulin output in response to the level of glucosein the blood.   Dr. Newgard said that several improvements are being madein the cells prior to tests in animals and eventually humans,possibly within three to five years. At present, the cellsbegin secreting insulin too soon, before blood glucose levelsrise to where normal beta cells would secrete insulin, aproblem he believes can easily be solved. The cells alsosecrete a mouse version of a pituitary hormone, ACTH, whichmay or may not affect humans.   The research, nevertheless, &quot;represents a first steptoward engineering of an artificial beta cell,&quot; theresearchers reported.</TEXT></DOC>
