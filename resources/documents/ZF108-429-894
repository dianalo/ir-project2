 To some extent these failures have been attributed to a lack ofappropriate information systems development methodologies (ISDMs) [32, 65].andO;However, in spite of the emergence of new ISDMs, information systems design(ISD) is still largely a complex and unstructured process, usually withambiguous goals.andP;  Accordingly, systems designers must make a number ofchoices which significantly affect the systems development process and itsoutcomes [55].andM;In the absence of explicit policies or guidelines, these choices aredetermined, to a large extent, by the systems designers' personal values.'andO;During the design process, the designer, either consciously orsubconsciously, makes a series of incremental choices in the design andimplementation of a system [16].andP;  To some extent, there are methods orstandards guiding the ISD process.andP;  However, most of the time these standardsdo not readily apply.andP;  The context is never exactly as assumed, and thestandard procedures have to be interpreted.andP;  Furthermore, these standards arefar from complete and the designer has to fill in the blanks, especially asregards implementation and organizational design.andP;  Similarly, the managementobjectives specified for the project are usually very high level and far fromspecific.andP;  The designer has to define, interpret, and operationalize themissing objectives in the absence of clear directions.andP;  Accordingly,designers have to rely on their own judgment for making the design decisions.andO;Hedberg and Mumford [32] state:andM;&quot;It is reasonable to assume that values play an important part in guiding thedesigners' choice between different design alternatives ...andP;  The values,needs and objective of top management and systems designers will influencethe kind of technical, organizational and task structure alternatives theyconsider during the design process and the solutions they eventually choose.&quot;andM;The premise that the designers' values influence design choices also findssupport in the work of scholars in the fields of management science, general,systems theory, and information systems [4, 14, 15, 16, 36, 39, 40, 41, 54,55, 64].andM;The designer's values, however, may not always be instrumental in achievingsystems that are consistent with organizational objectives.andP;  Indeed, a numberof authors suggest that overly technical, rational, and economic valueorientation of systems designers, accompanied by a lack of attention topolitical, organizational, and psychological issues, is the cause ofdeficiencies in existing IS development practices [12, 18, 26, 29, 31, 32,44, 55, 71, 72, 73].andM;Once the influence of systems designers values on design decisions isrecognized, it becomes important that the values which guide these designchoices must be made explicit.andP;  A better understanding of system designers'values could provide clues for explaining design decisions in developmentprojects.andP;  Furthermore, such an understanding is useful in order toandM;a.andP;  Guide the design, development, and adoption of information systemsdevelopment methodologies which are consistent with, and complement thesystem designers' values, so that a balanced set of social andorganizational, as well as technical and economic objectives may be achieved;andM;b.andP;  Change the control and reward structures for systems designers to reflectthe growing concerns in organizations and societies for taking social,organizational, and human values into account;andM;c.andP;  (Re-) Design curricula for teaching, training, and socializing systemsdesigners to introduce them to design issues and choices other than thosewith which they are currently familiar;andM;d.andP;  Provide a possible basis for a redrafting of the codes of ethics andcodes of good practice existing in professional societies;andM;e.andP;  Caution against direct technology transfer (methodologies, software, andhardware) from one societal/organizational culture to another without makingsuitable adjustments for the different values which may exist in theseorganizations or societies.andM;The designers' values are the product of the professional, social, andorganizational context within which they are held, and of the individual'sbackground and education.andP;  Accordingly, their design choices are stronglyinfluenced by their socio-cultural environment.andP;  A study and comparison ofdesigner values in different cultures could therefore provide cluesexplaining the differences in design behaviors in the respective cultures,and suggest a basis for technology transfer and education interchange.andP;  Thepresent research has two major objectives:andM;1.andP;  to investigate the extent to which technical, economic and/orsocio-political values are guiding development choices in contemporaryorganizationsandM;2.andP;  to investigate whether there are any significant differences betweendesigner values in Canada (a North American society) and Denmark (aScandinavian society)andM;The two countries in this cross-cultural comparison can be taken to representtwo different sets of cultural orientations within the capitalist-socialistspectrum of the western democracies.andP;  Canada, with its geographical andcultural proximity to the U.S., is closer to the capitalist ideal exemplifiedby the U.S.andP;  Denmark, on the other hand, with its Scandinavian heritage and asocial-democratic tradition, symbolizes a strong mixture of socialist andcapitalist value ideals.andP;  The value biases inherent in the two cultures areexpected to be reflected in the value differences between the systemsdesigners in the two countries.andM;In the past, attempts have been made to analyze, understand, and performcross-cultural comparisons of systems designers' values [6, 7, 17, 31, 70].andO;These studies (particularly [17, 70]) have indicated value differencesbetween Scandinavian and Anglo-American systems designers, mainly withrespect to user job-satisfaction related value issues.andM;Several methodological problems have been raised with these earlier studies[17, 44].andP;  First, these studies are restricted in the sense they focus onuser job satisfaction aspects of systems designers' values in isolation fromother values.andP;  The design process involves consideration of, and trade-offsbetween technical, economic, and socio-political factors (includingorganizational and job satisfaction factors).andP;  It is the conflict betweenthese factors and the relative priorities attached to these developmentobjectives that determines the level of subscription to the socio/politicalvalues.andP;  Therefore, measuring the organizational and user job satisfactionvalues in isolation, with no trade-offs, is not likely to mirror systemsdevelopment choices in reality.andM;Second, the additional qualitative data collected in these studies [17, 55]indicates there is an apparent conflict between designers' stated values(&quot;espoused-theories&quot;) and their operational values (&quot;theory-in-use&quot;) [3].andP;  Asthe earlier studies [6, 7, 17, 31, 70] elicited only &quot;espoused-theories&quot;there is no guarantee these values will actually be translated into designdecisions.andP;  (See discussion on constraining variables).andM;Finally, these studies start with the assumption there is a consensus aboutthe preferred direction of organizational change.andP;  However, it is possiblethat not all stake-holders find a certain direction of change, such as anincreased level of technological sophistication, a reduction in operatingbudget, increased autonomy, or increased task variety desirable.andM;In response to these criticisms, a value elicitation methodology based uponthe pioneering work of England [21] was developed.andP;  This article reports uponthe use of this methodology in measuring the values of Canadian and Danishsystems designers.andM;The article is organized as follows: First, we will describe a modeloutlining the role of systems designers' values in information systemsdesign.andP;  Next, we will present the theoretical underpinnings of valuemeasurement, and the methodology which was used as a basis for the presentstudy for measuring these values.andP;  This will be followed by reports on theresearch method, and an analysis of the results with respect to the twoobjectives of this article.andM;ROLE OF VALUES IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS DESIGNandM;A general conceptual model illustrating the central role of values in ISD isshown in Figure 1.andP;  The model identifies two main determinants influencingthe values of an individual or group: the background and/or characteristicsof the individual and the context.andP;  (See following description.)andM;Individual background is used as an umbrella for the general socializationand training process individual designers are subjected to in growing up.andO;Major influences are attributed to the educational system, on-the-jobtraining, and the family and cultural influences the person is subjected toin his or her formative years.andP;  Context refers to the present environment ofthe individual, i.e., the organizational, societal, and the occupationalculture in which the individual functions.andP;  A number of studies havedocumented significant value differences between societies [33], betweenorganizations [48, 60], and between different occupations [68].andP;  These twodeterminants of values-individual background and context-should not be seenas independent of each other.andP;  There is a high level of interaction, and itis fairly difficult to trace the origin of certain values [7, 55].andM;In addition to these primary determinants, the model identifies two secondarydeterminants: the ISD methodologies, and the control/reward structures fordesigners, as constraints on system designer values.andP;  These secondarydeterminants are identified as constraints because of their particularcharacter.andP;  In the short run they do not directly shape an individual's valuestructure.andP;  But, by sanctioning certain practices and discouraging others,they act as modifiers; i.e., they influence which of the individual'sinherent values may be operationalized into action, and which external valueswill be &quot;adopted&quot; by the individual (see upcoming discussion on intended andadopted values).andP;  However, in the long run, with repeated feedback andreinforcement, some of these constraints could become internalized in anindividual's value structure.andM;When a particular methodology is prescribed as a standard or a guideline fordevelopment, one is incorporating into the specific design process theontological assumptions about what constitutes reality, and theepistemological assumptions about how to conduct the ISD inquiry.andP;  In thisway the ISD methodology has an important influence on which values turn outto become theories in use [52].andP;  For example, if Structured Analysis [19] ischosen as the methodology for ISD in a particular context, (instead of forexample, ETHICS [56], the design objectives are likely to be dominantlytechnical/economic (rather than socio-political) and the system specifiedwill be described with data dictionaries and dataflow, diagrams as thecentral specification tools instead of for instance, work role descriptions.andM;In a similar fashion, the control and reward structure in the particularorganization constrains the extent to which values may be translated intoconcrete behavior.andP;  Espoused theories-ideal models the designer thinks thathe or she is, or should be, following-may never become theories-in-use oractual behavior [3, 35], if the control and reward structures do not includeconsideration of these values.andM;The final relationships in the model between the systems design andimplementation process, the resulting design, and the success/failure of ISDhas been dealt with extensively in IS implementation literature [28, 51, 72,73].andM;In summary, the purpose of the model is to illustrate the origin of valuesand the central role they have in specifying the details of the designprocess and in the operationalization of the design objectives.andP;  The exactnature of the relationship is not important for our purposes here.andP;  Itsuffices to emphasize that values play an important part.andM;DEVELOPMENT OF THEandM;RESEARCH INSTRUMENTandM;Theoretical Foundation for Measuring ValuesandM;The most serious criticism of the earlier studies of system designer valuesis the question regarding the extent to which espoused theories would resultin theories in use.andP;  This problem is addressed in England's [21] &quot;TheoreticalModel of the Relationship of Values to Behaviour.&quot; Central to his work is aclassification of all values into two major categories: relevant (conceivedin England's terminology) and non-relevant.andP;  The relevant values are furthersub-classified according to their propensity for influencing behavior:andM;Operative Values which have a very high probability of translation fromespoused theories to actual behavior.andM;Adopted Values which are, only to a small extent, part of the personalitystructure of the individual, but may affect behavior through situationalfactors-notably management control and reward structuresandM;Intended Values which the individual states are important to him/her but haveonly moderate probability of being translated from the intentional state intobehavior because of situational factorsandM;Since this is a more detailed classification of values, it will be usedinstead of the distinction between espoused theories or theories in use.andP;  Inorder to be able to classify the values of an individual, England developedand validated a value measurement methodology and instrument called thePersonal Value Questionnaire (PVQ) [21, 23, 24].andP;  This methodology has beenused by England and several others to measure the value systems of variousmanagerial groups [21, 22, 24], union leaders [251, small business owners[491, educational administrators [671, and U.S.andP;  Naval officers [22].andM;The PVQ is based on the rationale that the meaning an individual attaches toa set of value dimensions provides a useful description of his/her personalvalue system, which in turn is strongly related to his/her behavior insystematic ways [59].andP;  England's PVQ determines the behavioral strength ofeach value concept by measuring meaning along two dimensions (modes):andM;1.andP;  Importance Mode: measures the degree of importanceandM;of a value concept to an individual.andP;  The mode ofandM;valuation used is a 5-point importance scale.andM;2.andP;  Reason Mode: measures the primary rationale for attachingandM;importance to each value dimension.andP;  TheandM;rationale could be one of success (likely to furtherandM;personal success, such as career prospects), right (inandM;moral, ethical terms), or pleasant (personally attractive,andM;affective).andM;According to the theory developed by England, and substantiated in [21, 22,23, 24, 25, 49], the combination of the importance modes and reason modes isa far better predictor of the actual behavior than the importance modes aloneused in earlier studies of designer values.andP;  The two measures of meaningattached to each value dimension by the respondent are used to distinguishthe respondent's operative values from his adopted, intended, and nonrelevantvalues.andM;This is achieved through tallying the responses of an individual on all valuedimensions in order to determine his/her &quot;Dominant Reason Mode&quot; (PrimaryValue Orientation in England's terminology).andP;  The Dominant Reason Mode is thereason (success, right, or pleasant) most frequently attached by theindividual to the value dimensions which he/she considers important.andM;The value dimensions which an individual states are important, and whichmatch his/her Dominant Reason Mode, will be the ones most likely to betranslated into actual behavior [23].andP;  These are his/her operative values.andO;At the opposite extreme are those value dimensions which are not consideredimportant and do not match the person's dominant reason mode, these areclassified as nonrelevant values.andP;  In between are the behaviorally lessrelevant intended values and the situationally induced adapted values.andP;  Theintended values are dimensions which the individual espouses (states asimportant) but which do not match the dominant reason mode, and thereforeless likely to become theory-in-use), and the situationally induced adoptedvalues (values which are not part of the individual's espoused value system,i.e., are stated as having average or low importance for the individual, butmatch his/her dominant reason mode and therefore have some likelihood ofadoption in practice [23, 45].andM;An individual's value profile is constructed by first determining theperson's dominant reason mode, and then classifying each value dimension onthe PVQ into one of the four value categories of operative, adopted,intended, and non-relevant, using this outlined scheme.andM;The aggregate value profile of a respondent group is defined as theenumeration of the Behavioral Relevance Scores (BRS) [23, 45] for each valuedimension.andP;  The BRS for a value dimension is defined as the percentage of thetotal group for whom the particular value dimension is an operative value.andO;Accordingly, a high BRS for a value dimension for a group indicates that, inthat group, there is a high likelihood this value would be translated intoactual behavior.andM;Development of ISD-PDQandM;Another criticism of the earlier studies of designer values was their focuson organizational and job satisfaction values in isolation from technical andeconomic values.andP;  The ISD-PVQ was designed to include three sets of valuedimensions: economic, technical, and sociopolitical traditionally found in ISliterature [11, 12, 31, 38, 55].andM;Furthermore, there are technical, economic, and socio-political valuesregarding the means as well as ends of any design action [42].andP;  This isconsistent with Rokeach [62, p. 7]:andM;&quot;When we say that a person has a value, we may have in mind either his (her)beliefs concerning desirable modes of conduct or desirable end-states ofexistence.andP;  We will refer to these two kinds of values as instrumental andterminal values.&quot;andM;In the context of ISD, these concepts can be translated as DevelopmentProcess or means related and Development Product or ends related technical,economic, and socio-political values.andM;A literature survey was used to identify a list of value dimensions withinthese categories.andP;  This list was reviewed for clarity, completeness, andorthogonality by a panel of seven systems experts (information systemspractitioners, users, and academics).andP;  This was done to ensure content andface validity [10].andM;The third criticism of earlier studies of designer values was the assumptionof consensus about the preferred direction of what constitutes improvement.andO;This assumption may not always be justified.andP;  For example, some respondentsmight consider it desirable to achieve increased sophistication of hardware(i.e., achieve state-of-the-art), while others might find it undesirablesince it might increase the likelihood of problems in adopting as yetuntested technology.andP;  Therefore, in addition to the importance and reasonmode, each value dimension was measured on a &quot;Preferred Direction of Change&quot;dimension.andM;In summary, for each of the value dimensions there are three scales:importance rating (very low, low, medium, high, very high); reason mode(success, right, pleasure); direction of change (increase, neutral,decrease).andM;The questionnaire was pretested on a representative group.andP;  In addition, atest-retest of the questionnaire (with four weeks in between the twoadministrations) was performed with a sample of 13 accounting and businessstudents.andP;  The test-retest reliability coefficients for the importancerating, the reason mode and the preferred direction of change were 0.89,0.84, and 0.93 respectively.andP;  These reliability co-efficients are comparableto those reported for the original England PVQ [25].andM;RESEARCH METHODandM;The field survey was conducted in 13 Canadian and eight Danish business andgovernment organizations.andP;  The organizations sampled included federal,provincial and city government departments; electric and nuclear powerutilities; manufacturing, retail, and businesses, insurance, anduniversities.andP;  To obtain the sample we contacted the highest rankinginformation systems executive in the selected organizations.andP;  However, sinceonly those organizations which consented to participate in the study wereincluded, (i.e., it was a convenience sample), the possibility of samplingbias remains.andP;  No major differences were found between the types oforganizations within the two samples, which might otherwise explain thedifferences between the two samples reported next.andM;In each organization the IS executives were requested to select randomly agroup of system designers.andP;  The ISD-PVQ was administered to the respondentgroup in a meeting.andP;  To encourage the respondents to respond according totheir personal preferences, they were told there were no right or wronganswers and that the individual responses were confidential.andP;  Though attemptswere made to ensure equivalent questionnaire administration in bothcountries, the possibility of translation and interviewer bias remains.andM;RESULTSandM;The final sample contains 132 Canadian and 72 Danish systems designers from atotal of 21 organizations.andP;  Of the 132 Canadian respondents, 34 (26 percent)were found to have no dominant reason mode (i.e., no overall preference forsuccess, right, or pleasant as the rationale for importance).andP;  Similarly, ofthe 72 Danish designers, 21 (29 percent) were found to have a no dominantreason mode.andP;  These respondents were excluded from further analysis becausethe classification of values into the four categories (operational, adopted,intended, and nonrelevant) requires a dominant reason mode [23, 24].andP;  Thepercentage of respondents having no dominant reason mode is similar for bothcountries, therefore the exclusion of these respondents does not invalidatethe following analysis.andM;For the remaining respondents, each person's value profile was determined andBRS value profiles were calculated for Canadian and Danish samples accordingto the procedure described in the Theoretical Foundation for MeasuringValues.andM;Overview of Value Profiles in Canada and DenmarkandM;Table I presents an overview of Canadian and Danish designers' valueprofiles.andP;  For both samples the technical values seem to be the mostbehaviorally relevant, followed closely by economic values.andP;  Thesocio-political values have the lowest behavioral relevance score in bothsamples and are the least likely to be translated into behavior.andM;If the two samples (i.e., the rows of the table) are examined separately.andO;The Canadian system designers seem to focus strongly on technical andeconomic value dimensions, while they find the socio-political values to bethe least behaviorally relevant.andP;  A similar pattern is found in the Danishsample.andP;  However, the three value groups have a relatively more equalpotential for driving the behavior of the Danish systems designers.andM;If we examine the technical, economic, and sociopolitical value groups (i.e.,andO;the columns of the table) separately, we find that technical values arebehaviorally more relevant for the Canadian system designers, whereassocio-political values are behaviorally more relevant for the Danish systemdesigners.andP;  The potential of economic values for influencing behavior isalmost equal for the two samples.andM;The upcoming section discusses the Development Product-Related valuedimensions (Table II).andP;  This is followed by a discussion on the DevelopmentProcess Related value dimensions (Table III).andP;  For both of these tables, thebehavioral relevance scores and the percentage of individuals preferring acertain direction of change is enumerated for each value dimension.andP;  Thelevel of significance is calculated for both, using cross-tabulation and thechi-square statistic.andP;  For BRS, the significance is analyzed across all fourbehavioral relevance categories (operative, adopted, intended, andnonrelevant).andP;  Only those value dimensions where the BRS and/or the PreferredDirection of Change is significantly different (alpha less than or equal to10 percent) between the Canadian and Danish samples are presented.andM;Product-Related Value DifferencesandM;Product-related values are shown in three tables relating to the technical(IIA), economic (IIB), and sociopolitical (IIC) values respectively.andP;  In theProduct-Related Technical Values (Table IIA), there are significantdifferences among seven of the 18 values in the group.andP;  For six of theseseven value dimensions, the Canadian system designers had a higher BRS thantheir Danish counterparts.andP;  On only one value dimension, &quot;Security of updateand retrieval access to information,&quot; did the Danish designers score higherthan the Canadian designers.andP;  This presumably reflects the legislativeconcern about privacy in the Scandinavian countries.andP;  On those valuedimensions where there is a significant difference in the Preferred Directionof Change, it is consistent with the differences in behavioral relevancescores.andM;In case of Product-Related Economic Values (Table IIB), there are significantdifferences in either the BRS or in the preferred direction of change inthree out of four value dimensions in the group.andP;  The Canadian designersfound the operating costs of the system more behaviorally relevant than didthe Danish designers, and significantly more of them preferred a decrease inthe operating costs of the system.andP;  However, the Danish designers found thevalue dimension &quot;control of the organizational resources&quot; more relevant thandid Canadian designers.andP;  An interpretation of these differences could be thatthe Canadian designers seem to be more concerned with efficiency (i.e., cost)issues, whereas the Danish designers seem to be more concerned with theiroverall effectiveness issue (control of organizational resources).andM;In the Product-Related Socio-Political Values (Table IIC), there aresignificant differences between Canadian and Danish designers in 14 out of 19value dimensions.andP;  In all but two of the cases, the Danish designers have ahigher behavioral relevance score, supported by an appropriate significantdifference in the preferred direction of change.andP;  The two value dimensionswhich do not follow this pattern are (a) the assignment, clarification, andformalization of responsibilities in user areas, and (b) the system'sresponsiveness to the primary client.andP;  In both cases the Canadian designersscored higher than the Danish designers.andP;  The first exception, however,confirms the general hypothesis from the earlier models of man&quot; studies thatthe Canadian designers are more Theory-X oriented, and look for greaterstructure and specificity in their designs.andP;  The second exception, which issignificantly different only in the preferred direction of change, mayreflect the greater consumer orientation in North-America.andM;Process (Development Project) -Related Value DifferencesandM;Process-related values are those value concepts that influence the selectionof the means of action, i.e., the development project.andP;  Table Ill outlinesthe differences in Canadian and Danish system designer values related to theprocess of systems design.andP;  It is subdivided into three parts: Table IIIAoutlines the differences in technical values; Table IIIB, the differences ineconomic values; and Table IIIC, the differences in socio-political values.andM;The Process Related Technical Values (Table IIIA) display high behavioralrelevance scores for both Canadian and Danish designers.andP;  Canadians scorehigher than Danes on six of the eight value dimensions in this group, thoughonly two of them (degree of consistency between work done by variousanalysts, and ease of producing and maintaining documentation) arestatistically significant.andP;  On the remaining two value dimensions flexibleand modifiable development standards, and promptness in responding todevelopment requests), a significantly greater percentage of Danish designersprefer an increase in the direction of change.andP;  In the case of the lattervalue dimension, Danes also have a significantly higher behavioral relevancescore, which may be attributed to the user-oriented nature of the valueconcept.andP;  This again confirms the general pattern that Canadians are moretuned to the technical aspects than are their Danish counterparts.andM;The responses to Process Related Economic Values suggest in general, a highlevel of behavioral relevance of these values to both Canadian and Danishsystem designers.andP;  However, a detailed analysis reveals statisticallysignificant differences in response patterns (Table IIIB).andP;  Whereas theCanadian designers seem to put the highest premium on efficiency-relatedvalues (such as reduced development costs, project within schedule and withinbudget, the planning and control of the development project), the Danishdesigners seem to be prepared to invest a greater level of user and designertime and resources in the development project (presumably to achieve a higherquality product).andP;  This is consistent with the pattern of differencesexpressed in the Product-Related Economic Values group where the Canadiandesigners put greater emphasis on efficiency, and the Danish designers' oneffectiveness.andM;Of the 13 Process Related Socio-Political Values, 10 had statisticallysignificant differences in either the behavioral relevance scores orpreferred direction of change or both.andP;  Among these differences, valuesrelated to participation and user understanding stand out as the mostbehaviorally relevant set of values.andP;  User participation shows a ratherremarkable distinction between the Canadian and Danish designers.andP;  While theCanadian designers emphasize increased participation by user managers, theDanish designers find participation by clerical/supporting staff users moreoperative.andP;  This reflects the management orientation and the reward structurein the Canadian environment versus the more democratic, user-orientedapproach in Denmark.andP;  However, the Canadian designers seem to find increaseduser understanding of the overall system design significantly more relevant.andO;A possible explanation of this finding could be that for this question theCanadian questionnaire did not specify the user-type whereas in translationthe Danish questionnaire specifically mentioned clerical users.andP;  A subsequentreview of the translation did not find any other translation differences.andO;The remaining significant differences support the general observation thatthe Danish designers find the socio-political values more operative.andO;However, it should be noted that the behavioral relevance scores for bothgroups are fairly low.andM;CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONSandM;The objectives of this article were twofold: to investigate the extent towhich technical, economic, or sociopolitical values are guiding systemsdesign in contemporary organizations, and to investigate the differencesbetween the values of Canadian and Danish systems designers.andM;For both countries, the results of the survey provide evidence for thedominance of technical and economic values.andP;  Given their cultural andgeographical proximity to the U.S., in the case of Canadian designers, thisresult is not surprising.andP;  However, in the case of Danish system designers,the results suggest that contrary to the conventional wisdom,social-democratic value positions do not always work to the detriment oftechnical and economic concerns.andM;Second, the survey confirms the assumptions of cross-cultural differences insystem designer values between Canada and Denmark.andP;  These differences arefound, not only for organizational and job-satisfaction values(socio-political values) as discovered in earlier studies [7, 17, 31, 70],but also for technical and economic value concepts.andP;  Even though both theCanadian and the Danish samples show a similar pattern of highest behavioralrelevance of technical values and lowest relevance of socio-political values,the difference between the three sets of values is substantially larger inthe Canadian sample.andP;  The three sets of values (technical, economic, andsocio-political) have a more equal potential for driving the behavior ofDanish designers.andP;  This finding could be a reflection of the mix of socialistand capitalist values in the Scandinavian society.andP;  Furthermore, in case ofeconomic values, Canadian designers are found to be concerned with efficiencyissues (such as cost and manpower usage), whereas the Danish designers aremore concerned with effectiveness issues (such as management oforganizational resources).andM;Before we discuss the implications of these findings for information systemsdevelopment, we need to clarify our baseline value position.andP;  It is ourbelief that, from an organizational effectiveness perspective, a balancedvalue orientation is essential to the design and implementation of successfulcomputer-based information systems.andP;  If the value structures or viewpoints ofthe system's designers are limited (i.e., if they emphasize only a limitedsubset from the range of technical, economic, and socio-political values),then the designers may create system designs which are inadequate orunacceptable from the perspective of the omitted value concerns.andP;  This, inturn, could lead to organizational, technical, or behavioral problems [2, 11,13, 29, 55, 72].andM;We therefore believe that if the designers are emphasizing only certain typesof values in their design decisions (specifically technical and efficiencyrelated economic values) while ignoring other types of values (such aseffectiveness and socio-political values), this represents a pathology whichneeds to be addressed.andP;  Though this value position may not be commonlyaccepted, it has a rich tradition in socio-technical literature (for a reviewof STS literature in the information systems context see [27]), and in partsof the information systems community (see [5, 12, 14, 16, 18, 30, 32, 36, 38,71, 72]).andP;  Furthermore, this value position is becoming more acceptable inthe current North-American business milieu [60].andM;In light of this value position, we believe that these findings haveimportant short-term and long-term policy implications.andP;  In the short-term,the cross-cultural value differences have implications in terms of problemsrelated to an uncritical technology transfer of off-the-shelf methodologies,tools, and techniques between different cultures [40].andP;  ISD methodologies,with their potential for economic, technical, and organizational changes,have built-in value biases reflecting the value priorities of the culture inwhich they are developed [43, 45].andP;  If a methodology overtly espouses valueswhich are alien to the values of the people who are the designated users ofthe methodology, the methodology will not be accepted [32, 43, 44, 65].andO;Furthermore, the products of ISD methodologies-the systems developed usingthese methodologies-may not be acceptable in cultures with value orientationsdifferent from the one in which the system  was developed.andM;However, the values might not be that apparent to the untrained eye, andsometimes methodologies and their resulting systems may be implanted withoutregard to the basic underlying assumptions.andP;  The result of such an implant islikely to be substantial conflict and/ or loss of potential.andP;  The valueelicitation methodology described in this article provides an a priori meansof clarifying the values in a particular context.andM;The long-run implications of these overall value profiles and valuedifferences can be analyzed in the context of the evolutionary perspective onthe use of information technology in organizations [30, 46].andP;  Heberg [30]suggests that organizations develop the use of information technology througha number of distinct stages.andP;  The first stage is the pioneering use of a newtechnology with organizational consequences coming as a surprise.andP;  In thesecond stage careful design is carried out to minimize unforeseen anddysfunctional organizational consequences.andP;  The third stage is characterizedby the realization that organizational goals can be achieved throughinformation systems change.andP;  Finally, the fourth stage is where aparticipative, evolutionary design strategy for increasing the effectivenessof the organization and the quality of working life of the people in theorganization is found.andM;Hedberg [30] suggests that all organizations and cultures go through the samestages primarily because of the general trends in society.andP;  Our data could beinterpreted to mean that due to contextual factors such as a socialdemocratic political tradition and a strong union influence thesedevelopments are coming earlier in the Scandinavian countries (see [20, 26,53, 66]).andP;  If this is true, there is a good case for the researchers andmethodology designers studying systems design practices in these countries inorder to learn from their successes and failures  e.g., [9, 50, 57, 58, 65]).andM;However, the techno-economic value orientation of system designers is a majorobstacle to the adoption of organizational and socio-political designpractices [34, 63].andP;  Therefore, we may need to attempt to influence theunderlying value structure of the system designers.andP;  Three options aresuggested: First, through education and training we could attempt to increasethe awareness of the designers, of the organizational and human consequencesof their designs [47, 58].andP;  Second, if the designs reflect an undesirablereward structure existing for designers, a more concerted effort may beneeded to educate those who plan, control, and manage the information systemsfunction in the organizations [17, 30, 43, 44].andP;  Third, the codes of ethicsand good practice of professional societies could be redrafted to reflect ahigher concern for socio-political dimensions.andM;It is our belief that a suitable combination of the strategies we havediscussed will be instrumental in making the respective designer groups moreaware of a balanced set of values, and would help the IS designer communityevolve toward a participatory, learning, and evolutionary strategy.andM;Acknowledgments.andP;
