In the ultrapyrolysis process, finely divided used alumina,used as a hot solid heat carrier, and cold wood particles are quicklymixed in a votical contactor (vortactor), are kept together for a shortcontact time and are then rapidly quenched by cold particles. This processcould be used to produce fuels and chemical product from wood, biomassand other carbonaceous materials. 8 rfs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
