Thousands of people gathered in Cobo Hall to hear speeches byconsumer advocate Ralph Nader, sex therapist Ruth Westheimer, PeaceCorps Director Loret Ruppe and U.S. Sen. Donald Riegle of Michigan.The convention runs through Thursday.   But many conventioneers from across the country came to look atexhibits of motor homes and vacation spots, exercise devices andmedications.   ``It's wonderful,'' said Sophie Grudzinski of Hobart, Ind. ``Butall these freebies, we just can't pass it up.''   She and Mary Bentley of Lake Station, Ind., were part of atwo-bus contingent coming from the Gary, Ind., area to thecnvention on Detroit's sprawling riverfront convention center.   ``I'm tired, I could use a little scooter,'' Mrs. Bentley saidwhile relaxing near a stage in the main exhibit hall whereentertainment was about to begin.   While here, the two women and thousands of others had theopportunity to attend seminars and hear speeches on consumer``rip-offs'' and patient rights, the federal budget and sexualityamong seniors by Westheimer.   During the convention, delegates will vote on a number ofresolutions that are not binding on the AARP's 3,600 localchapters. The organization will issue no political endorsements.   But Mrs. Grudzinski said she didn't agree with the nationalorganization's non-partisan policy.   ``There's so many of us,'' she said, ``that if we'd all sticktogether, we could really get things done.''   Nader told a room packed with more than 2,000 conventioneersthat they should watch out for fraud in prosthetic devices,telephone solicitations, prepared food and pharmaceuticals.   Ruppe told a group there were opportunities for senior citizensin the Peace Corps. She said Odilon Long just retired from thePeace Corps at 86, leaving 76-year-old Janet Klepper in Guatemalaas the oldest volunteer.   She said the proportion of senior citizens in the Peace Corpshas risen from 6 percent in 1961 to 12 percent now.   ``Age is respected in countries where we work,'' she said,adding that senior citizens' biggest problem with acceptance in theprogram is health, and a difficulty in learning a foreign language.   ``At the present moment, most of our seniors are serving inEnglish-speaking countries,'' she said.   Riegle, who is running for re-election as the state's seniorsenator in Washington, repeated his call for President Reagan tosign recently debated trade legislation and to break the SocialSecurity system out of the federal budget process.</TEXT></DOC>
