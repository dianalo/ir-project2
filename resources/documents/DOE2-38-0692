Themagnet surpassed the design field (90% of the short sample limit) onits first quench without training. The measured field quality is in excellentagreement with design calculations and meets collider requirements. Themagnetic field design was developed at Rice University and is the subjectof a Master's thesis. The features of the design include simple construction,efficient use of superconductor, and adequate containment of magneticforces. A straightforward extension of the design to an 8 T dipole isunder development. The high-field superferric magnet constitutes a significantimprovement in magnet performance and cost for future accelerators.</TEXT></DOC>
