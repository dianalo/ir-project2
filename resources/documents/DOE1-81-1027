These measures, if taken in combination,have an emission removal efficiency of around 90%. The data are basedon actual retrofittings of fossil fuelled large furnaces in the FederalRepublic of Germany. For retrofitting low NO/sub x/ combustion technologyinvestments of 10-20 DM/kW are normal. Considerably higher investmentcan be needed to attain even lower emission targets. For retrofittingsecondary measures, necessary in the FRG at all larger hard coal firedboilers, SCR processes are preferred. Up to 1987, retrofitted high dustSCR plants at dry bottom boilers involved an average investment of 91DM/kWel, exceeding the investment for new cases by 50%. The cost analysiscontains a systematic presentation of the surplus expenditure for retrofittingas well as a survey of case examples with 8 primary measures and 8 SCRplants. The different types of costs and their parameters are discussed.Cost calculations of NO/sub x/ reduction are presented, considering differentassumptions and conditions resulting in specific additional costs forelectricity generation at medium load of between 0.7 and 1.0 pf/kWh.6 tabs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
