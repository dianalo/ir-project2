SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan on Wednesday vetoedlegislation designed to toughen curbs on textile, apparel and shoeimports, arguing it would have ``disastrous effects'' on theeconomy at a time when exports are booming.   Only minutes after rejecting the textile measure in private,Reagan went before television cameras in the Rose Garden to sign abill paving the way for a multibillion-dollar free-trade zone withCanada.   In both cases, Reagan said he was acting to lower prices forconsumers and to ensure jobs for workers.   The textile bill, intended to protect American industriesagainst foreign competition, won final congressional approval lastFriday.   But Reagan, in a veto message released by the White House, said,``This bill represents protectionism at its worst.''   The measure won congressional approval without the two-thirdsmargin needed to override a veto, and White House spokesman MarlinFitzwater expressed confidence that Reagan's veto would besustained.   The House passed the bill by a vote of 248-150 on Sept. 23, andthe bill won Senate approval by a 59-36 vote on Sept. 13.   The president lavished praise on the Canadian free-tradeagreement, calling it ``a hallmark of free trade'' and ``theantithesis'' of the textile measure he'd just vetoed.   But the treaty has no force as yet because it is bottled up inthe Canadian Senate and its fate depends on the outcome of theCanadian election.   ``Protectionism does not save jobs,'' Reagan said in his vetomessage. He contended the textile bill ``would have disastrouseffects on the U.S. economy.''   ``It would impose needless costs on American consumers, threatenjobs in our export industries, jeopardize our overseas farm sales,and undermine our efforts to obtain a more open trading system forU.S. exports,'' Reagan said.   ``At a time when American exports are booming, the United Statesmust not embark on a course that would diminish our tradeopportunities,'' he added.   The president called the textile and apparel industries ``themost protected sector of our economy'' and said they wereundeserving of further aid.   Reagan charged that prices would climb and ``break the clothingbudgets of many American families'' if the legislation took effect.   With every move that has arisen on Capitol Hill to strengthentextile imports, Reagan has pledged to veto any resultinglegislation.   ``For eight years this administration has pursued anti-worker,anti-wages, anti-employment policies ... In vetoing this tradebill, President Reagan refuses to give the textile, apparel andfootwear industries the time they need to prepare and modernize forinternational competition,'' said House Speaker Jim Wright,D-Texas, of the president's action.   Fitzwater said Reagan vetoed the bill as soon as it arrived fromCapitol Hill on Wednesday morning.   Asked about possible repercussions from the veto on VicePresident George Bush's election effort in the South, where evensome staunch Republicans back the bill, Fitzwater replied, ``It'sour belief that, politics aside, ... protectionism is the issuehere.''   The bill would:   _Freeze textile and apparel imports at 1987 levels this year andlimit growth to 1 percent annually starting in January.   _Freeze imports of non-rubber footwear with no provision forincreases.   _Impose import quotas on 180 categories of textile products and30 types of footwear, a system that would be reviewed after 10years.   _Set up a one-year program under which the government wouldauction off import licenses and set a special quota for silkneckties.   Anticipating the veto, Rep. Butler Derrick, D-S.C., said Fridaythat he expected Congress to mount an effort next week to overrideReagan's action.   The House approved the bill on a vote of 248-150 on Friday.Earlier this month, the Senate approved the measure, 59-36.   The textile and apparel industries, along with a number ofunions and their congressional allies, called the bill vital tostemming job losses. They point to the loss of more than 400,000jobs in the 1980s when a surge of imports hit the U.S. market.   While acknowledging that industry earnings have recoveredsomewhat, they say profits have dropped again, imports still areflooding American markets, and plants still are closing.   But the measure's critics _ including retailers, importers andthe administration _ dispute those claims and warn that new curbswould trigger retaliation against U.S. exports.   The opponents contend the industry is flourishing because ofincreases in efficiency and automation sparked by increasedcompetition.   The free trade agreement with Canada was approved by the Senateon Sept. 19 by a vote of 83-0.   The bill calls for a 10-year phase-out of tariffs and a numberof other trade curbs under the pact signed in January by thepresident and the Canadian prime minister.   The president's signature clears the way for U.S. action inphasing out tariffs on $131 billion in merchandise that crosses theU.S.-Canada border each year.   The agreement was approved this year by the Canadian House ofCommons, but leaders of the the Canadian Senate have said they willdelay action until Prime Minister Brian Mulroney holds an election.There is speculation in Canada that Mulroney will call an electionfor late November. He is four years into his term and is a strongsupporter of the agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
