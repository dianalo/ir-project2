A senior administration official who is involved in thebudget talks emphasized in an interview that while theadministration is approaching the talks with an open mind,&quot;we haven't changed what we favor and we haven't changed whatwe're opposed to.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater gave reporters thesame message. &quot;In the past, some people have said thatraising taxes has to be on the table,&quot; he said. &quot;But nopreconditions means just the opposite. It means the table isclean.&quot;   Nevertheless, talk on Capitol Hill continued to center ontaxes. Referring to Mr. Bush's &quot;Read my lips: No new taxes&quot;campaign pledge, House Ways and Means Chairman DanRostenkowski (D., Ill.) said that &quot;we won't have to worryabout lips anymore&quot; but instead can &quot;start digging into ourpockets.&quot;   Republican congressional leaders joined the White House intrying to cool speculation that the budget summit willprovide political cover for tax increases. Emerging from acaucus with his members, House Republican Leader RobertMichel (R., Ill.) told reporters, &quot;I told them to keep theirpowder dry.&quot;   Other Republicans, however, continued to argue thatDemocrats are forcing the president to raise taxes. Rep. BillArcher of Texas, the senior Republican on the House Ways andMeans Committee and a delegate to the summit, said, &quot;When wesit down and talk, we expect them {Democrats} to put highertaxes as the linchpin of a deficit-reduction program.&quot;   That sort of talk led House Majority Leader RichardGephardt (D., Mo.), who is to head the summit talks when Mr.Bush isn't present, to complain: &quot;If people simply see it asa political high-ground exercise, then it won't go anywhere.&quot;   Added House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.): &quot;Good faithmeans not posturing politically on either side.&quot;   But in an illustration of the tensions between theparties, remarks by Rep. Robert Torricelli (D., N.J.)suggesting that Mr. Bush had been &quot;intellectually dishonest&quot;during his 1988 presidential campaign provoked aparliamentary flap on the House floor. Republicans, objectingto that description of Mr. Bush's position on taxes, tried toblock Mr. Torricelli from proceeding. It took a House vote,won by Democrats, for the New Jersey liberal to winpermission to continue. Mr. Torricelli subsequently describedMr. Bush's position on taxes in terms only slightly lessstringent, saying that Mr. Bush had been &quot;intellectuallyinconsistent.&quot;   Meanwhile, the White House -- reacting in part to demandsfrom many Democrats that the administration help prepare thepublic for the possibility of a painful deficit-reductionpackage -- described the government's fiscal plight inincreasingly dire terms.   &quot;Severe action needs to be taken to reduce the deficit andkeep the economy on a sound track,&quot; Mr. Fitzwater said. &quot;Thedeficit is increasing due to a number of factors -- partlyrising interest rates, reduced revenues to the government,and the cost of the savings and loan bailout.&quot;   But responding to concerns voiced by rank-and-fileDemocrats, House Budget Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)asked White House Budget Director Richard Darman to testifybefore his committee Tuesday both to explain theadministration's swelling deficit forecast and to detail taxand spending policies that the administration proposes inresponse. A spokeswoman for Mr. Darman said that becausesummit talks are to begin Tuesday, he won't testify on thatday.   Congressional negotiators at the so-called summit nextweek will include the Democratic chairmen and the seniorRepublicans on the Senate and House Budget, Appropriationsand tax-writing committees. Two partisan House leaders alsowill be involved: Speaker Foley designated Mr. Gephardt ashis representative and Mr. Michel designated House MinorityWhip Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.). Senate Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell (D., Maine) picked Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.) ashis representative. Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R.,Kan.) designated Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas).   The White House lists the president, Chief of Staff JohnSununu, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, and Mr. Darman asits formal negotiating team, but officials said Messrs.Darman and Brady will play the major day-to-day role. Othermembers of the administration will also be included. WhiteHouse chief economist Michael Boskin will deal with tax andeconomic policy; Defense Secretary Richard Cheney andNational Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft will addressdefense issues; and the president's domestic policy adviser,Roger Porter, will handle domestic spending programs.   Although administration officials said talks will go on aslong as both sides find them productive, a senior officialsaid the hope is that they will progress quickly and beconcluded in &quot;weeks rather than months.&quot;   The immediate goal of budget talks is to find a way toreduce the deficit for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, bybetween $45 billion and $55 billion. That's the amount theadministration says is needed to avoid across-the-boardspending cuts this fall under the Gramm-Rudmandeficit-reduction law. If all spending on the thrift industrycleanup is included in the complex Gramm-Rudman calculations,the administration says, $100 billion in deficit-reductionmeasures will be needed.</TEXT></DOC>
