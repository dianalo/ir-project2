The 6-3 ruling means that MCA Inc., actor Jimmy Stewart,and Mr. Hitchcock's estate will have to share revenue fromthe re-release of the film and distribution on videocassettewith Sheldon Abend, a literary agent who now owns thecopyright for the short story.</LP><TEXT>   The ruling, written by Justice Sandra O'Connor, also willhave far-reaching effects not only on the film industry buton all producers of works that rely on other copyrightedmaterial.   The decision places a cloud over the rights to revenuesproduced by a large number of works: those that were based onother copyrighted material, that were made before a newfederal copyright law took effect in 1978 and for which theowner of the original copyright died before that copyrightcould be renewed. Before 1978, all copyrights lasted 28 yearsand could be renewed for another 28-year term.   Mr. Abend estimated that there are more than 600feature-length motion pictures based on literary works wherethe authors died in the first term of copyright and thecopyright was validly renewed by their heirs. &quot;What thismeans is that these major studios will have to stopdistributing these movies and clear them with the estates andgive the heirs a fair chance&quot; to share in the profits, Mr.Abend said.   Stephen Kroft, a Beverly Hills, Calif., lawyer who filed afriend-of-the-court brief for major motion picture studiosand distributors, said: &quot;This will affect a lot of worksbesides films. There will be a lot of uncertainty aboutcopyrights for a long time. Somebody who exploits copyrightedworks is going to have to research extensively the history ofthe copyright.&quot;   But Peter Anderson, a lawyer in Santa Monica, Calif., whorepresents Mr. Abend, said the ruling is a &quot;victory&quot; fororiginal, artistic creators.   The amount to which Mr. Abend is entitled will bedetermined by a federal court in a hearing; a federal appealscourt estimated that the re-release yielded $12 million inrevenue from 1983 to 1988. The federal court also will haveto determine Mr. Abend's share of future revenue.   The short story, &quot;It Had to Be Murder,&quot; was written in1942 by Cornell Woolrich. In 1945, he sold the film rights toa movie company and, in 1954, &quot;Rear Window,&quot; starring Mr.Stewart and Grace Kelly, was released. The author promisedthat the movie company could distribute the film for both thecopyright and renewal periods. But Mr. Woolrich died in 1968before he could renew the copyright. In 1969, the executorsof his estate renewed the copyright and sold it in 1971 toMr. Abend for $650.   After &quot;Rear Window&quot; was re-released in 1983, Mr. Abendsued. A federal district court in Los Angeles dismissed thelawsuit, but a federal appeals court in San Franciscoreversed the decision.   The legal question was whether the producer of a film orother work that relies, with permission, on copyrightedmaterials may continue to distribute that work during the28-year renewal period. The high court said that the producerof a work that uses copyrighted material with validpermission can't continue to distribute that work during therenewal period, unless the original creator properly renewedthe first copyright.   Justice John Stevens dissented, joined by Chief JusticeWilliam Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia.   Mr. Abend's lawyer, Mr. Anderson, said the ruling willreturn the law that governs work based on copyrightedmaterial to its original purpose. &quot;The effect of the law wasto ensure that the real creators of a work would benefit fromthe exploitation of their works, as would their familiesafter they died,&quot; Mr. Anderson said.   But Mr. Kroft, who filed the brief for the film industry,said: &quot;Where the copyright renewal rights are owned by asuccessor, they've got a noose around the producers now&quot; ofworks derived from copyrighted material.   The movie producers and distributors for whom Mr. Kroftspoke declined yesterday to comment separately on thedecision. These included Columbia Pictures Industries Inc., aunit of Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.;Orion Pictures Corp.; Paramount Pictures Corp., a unit ofParamount Communications Inc.; and Fox Film Corp., a unit ofRupert Murdoch's News Corp.   A spokesman for Mr. Stewart said the actor didn't have anycomment on the Supreme Court's decision.   &quot;This has put a whole number of works in limbo,&quot; saidLouis P. Petrich, who represented MCA and the otherdefendants. &quot;All the works created from 1962 to 1977 that aresubject to renewal are going to become like lepers, becauseif you use them in creating a new work, there's always thepotential that they're going to be like a little time bomb.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
