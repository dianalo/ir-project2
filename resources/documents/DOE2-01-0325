This is indicative of the presence of an interveninggalaxy belonging to the same cluster as the (galaxy containing the) nearerquasar. The likelihood of this occurring is calculated in terms of thegalaxy correlation function and it is found that present results alreadysuggest that quasars at redshifts above one must be associated with richclusters.</TEXT></DOC>
