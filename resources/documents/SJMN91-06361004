So why not consider making a few resolutions to havemore fun in your own backyard? It's close at hand, probably underutilized, andpresents myriad opportunities for fun and relaxation, as well as a fairquotient of silliness.;   The following suggested resolutions are just that --suggestions. No doubt you'll have your own ideas for fun in your own backyard.Just to keep you on track, write them down and post them on the refrigeratordoor. One day next summer, one or two of them may strike you as good anddoable ideas.;   Just think how great you'll feel next New Year's, when youcan say with pride that you followed through on at least some of your bestintentions. There's always next year for &quot;War and Peace.&quot;;   (box)  Buyyourself a hammock and resolve to lie in it for at least 30 minutes, threetimes during the year. While you're at it, purchase a set of pleasant-soundingwind chimes and hang them nearby. Combined with the gentle swaying, thechimes' sweet, random music will produce an altogether beneficial effect onthe inhabitant of the hammock. Better even than a massage -- or those 50minutes on the therapist's couch.;   (box)  At least twice during summervacation, instigate some backyard fun for the kids. Whether it's a carnival, apet parade, a backyard overnight camp-out, or the building of a tree house orfort, the younger set will definitely view you with a whole new, highlyrespected, perspective.;   (box)  Buy two large clay pots -- as large as yourpatio or deck can handle -- and plant them with nothing more than a bunch ofred-flowering geraniums. This may well be the most primitive form ofgardening, but it is also one of the most delightful. It's sure to garnerplenty of compliments, while dressing up your outdoor living area at the sametime.;   (box)  Ferret out some Chinese paper lanterns. At least once duringthe summer, hang them from whatever happens to be convenient and invite yourfamily or friends over for a backyard dinner. When dusk falls, and thelanterns are lighted, you'll be surprised at the magical spell they cast overyour guests. Almost guaranteed to instill lifelong, pleasant memories.;  (box)  Resolve to sleep in your backyard once -- maybe twice -- during thehottest days of summer. Drag the futons, or your top mattress, onto the deck,patio or lawn --anywhere you can enjoy the starry night sky. If you do this ona weeknight, you'll go off to work the next morning in a pleasant frame ofmind. And if you camp out in your backyard on a weekend night . . . well, whoknows?;   (box)  If you don't already have one, resolve to buy a picnic tableand bench set. You'll never eat outdoors if there's no place to do it. Picnictables are also great places for those arts and crafts projects that are toomessy to be done indoors -- by either kids or adults. Place it in the shade ofa tree and use it as much as possible.;   (box)  Go to the variety store andbuy the biggest wading pool you can find. Not for the kids -- for you! On thehottest Saturday of the year, blow it up, fill it with water, and invite somefriends over for a pool party. The kids can use it after you're through withyour fun.;   (box)  Resolve to make homemade ice cream in your backyard atleast once. Fresh peach or strawberry would be nice. Maybe on the Fourth ofJuly? You'll remember the flavor for the rest of the year.;   (box)  Be abetter friend to those delightful backyard denizens, the birds. Set up a birdfeeder or bird bath in your backyard. The feathered set will be eternallygrateful, providing you with non-stop entertainment for as long as you feedthem or provide them with water.;   (box)  Resolve not to make any resolutionswhile you're in your backyard. It's one place that should remain aresolution-free zone. Relax. Enjoy yourself.;   Here's to a New Year filledwith a little peace and a lot of fun in your own backyard.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  A.
