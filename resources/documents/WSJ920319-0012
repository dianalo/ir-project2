The pitchmen andwomen at Santa Monica public-radio station KCRW-FM appear tohave raised that art to new heights this pledge season.They're waving around the hold that Senator Dole and otherRepublicans put on authorization for Public Broadcastingfunding. KCRW's management has been calling on listeners tosave the station. The KCRW station manager and other staff,who know a good fund-raising bogyman when they see one, havebeen breaking into regular programming several times an hourto warn that the station might lose its federal funding,thanks to a cabal of Republicans intent on abridging publicbroadcasting's First Amendment rights. Pledge money has beenpouring in. Gee, maybe this is the solution to publicbroadcasting's money problems. Instead of high-tonedprogramming, just run clips of Senate floor debates toterrorize the audience.
