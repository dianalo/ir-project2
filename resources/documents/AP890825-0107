The pact, a copy of which was made available to The AssociatedPress, is aimed at high-seas salmon poaching by Taiwanese driftnetvessels.   The agreement calls for transmitters that will fix the locationof Taiwanese fishing vessels to be placed on board by 1990 andallows enforcement officers to board the vessels.   The United States has accused Taiwan fishermen of using driftnetsto deplete the North Pacific of its rich marine resources,especially the anadromous species of salmon that spawn in the UnitedStates.   Both Taiwan and the United States ban salmon fishing in theregion.   Conservationists have criticized the miles-long driftnets fortheir ``incidental'' catches of thousands of sea birds, seals andother animals.   ``We hope this will reduce salmon poaching,'' Doug Ellice,executive officer of the American Institute in Taiwan, said from hisWashington, D.C., office.   ``Taiwan's are not the only boats out there. We hope this wouldbe a model for the Koreans and others,'' Ellice said.   The United States earlier reached a driftnet agreement withJapan, but is still attempting to reach an agreement with SouthKorea.   ``Tough negotiating pays off,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski,R-Alaska. ``I believe signing this agreement lays the cornerstonefor an overall effort to secure our fisheries and protect a mostvital resource.''   The tentative agreement was signed Thursday by David Laux,chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, and Ding Mou-shih,Taiwan's representative in Washington. Diplomatic letters tofinalize the agreement were signed today.   Enforcement of the agreement will fall to the institute, which isthe unofficial U.S. embassy in Taipei. The institute's enforcementwill use U.S. government employees under contract to the institute,Ellice said.   Yu Yu-hsien, chairman of Taiwan's Council of Agriculture, saidthe agreement was not an ideal pact for local fishermen but it wasacceptable for Taiwan.</TEXT></DOC>
