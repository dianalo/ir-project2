Also the pions have a chance of being captured by thenucleus that drastically increases with decreasing quantum number, whichresults in a broadening of the levels. By inserting in the Klein-Gordonequation for the pion-nucleus system an optical potential representingthe strong interaction, one attempts to describe these shifts and widths.Experimental results for the pionic 3d orbit in some heavy nuclei indicatethat for them strong interaction widths are a factor of two smaller thanpredicted. Similar deviations have been observed for the strong interactionshifts. In order to check and investigate these discrepancies the pionicX-ray spectra of /sup 181/Ta, /sup nat/Re, /sup nat/Pt, /sup 197/Au,/sup 208/Pb and /sup 209/Bi have been measured to obtain data which providefor a systematical investigation of the pionic 3d levels. Special attentionwas devoted to methods of obtaining clearly improved results: large volumehigh-purity Ge detectors in combination with Compton suppression BGOshields were used; good statistics were obtained by using the very intensepion beam; background radiation in the Ge detectors caused by neutronsproduced in the targets has largely been reduced by using neutron TOFdiscrimination with respect to the incident stopped pion. By adding anisovector term to the optical potential the deviation from the theorycan be explained. 100 refs.; 42 figs.; 37 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
