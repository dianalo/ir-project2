Hundreds of police roamed the area, helicopters circled overheadand police vehicles were spotted as far as 10 miles from this town.   The security measures were aimed at preventing a repeat ofclashes between neo-Nazis and left-wing opponents on Hitler's 90thbirthday.   By midmorning, a constant stream of dozens of curious onlookersclustered near Hitler's birthplace, which was sealed off by metalbarriers.   Dozens of police cars blocked the street leading to the housethat is now a nursery for handicapped children. Many stores closedand at least two shops boarded their front windows.   A police spokesman said two Austrians, three Italians, twoGermans and one American were detained and face fines of up to$2,300 dollars.   The Italians, one of the Austrians and the American were seenraising their hands for the Nazi salute, said a police official whodid not give his name. Earlier, officials erroneously had reportedthat all five were Italian.   One West German was picked up by gendarmerie after he shoutedNazi slogans and spat at reporters. He was in possession of a largeknife, the police official said.   Another West German also shouted anti-Semitic and Nazi slogans _``Jew, go and rot'' and ``This will be a national holiday in 100years' time'' _ as he was dragged away.   Police declined to identify those detained. Schindler indicatedthey would face misdemeanor charges and not more serious criminalcharges under an Austrian law that bans neo-Nazi activity.   On Wednesday, four unidentified Americans, an Irishman and aWest German were ordered by police to change their clothes afterarriving in Braunau in black boots and brown shirts reminiscent ofthe Nazi uniform, police said.   Police said ``several people'' were turned back at the nearbyWest German border. A spokesman declined to give details.   In West Germany, scores of foreigners closed their shops andmany others kept their children out of schools in Hamburg todaybecause of fears of violence, officials said.   In West Berlin, police arrested nine members of self-styled``protection troops'' that had been cruising the streets to preventneo-Nazi attacks on foreigners and Jewish landmarks.   West Berlin police also said that a Turkish cemetery wasvandalized early today. More than 38 gravemarkers were overturnedor damaged, officials said.   The anniversary got little mention in West German newspapers,but a senior official warned of possible violence by neo-Nazigroups against foreigners.   Peter Frisch, vice-president of the Federal Office for theProtection of the Constitution in Frankfurt, said there are about30,000 rightist extremists in West Germany, including about 1,500neo-Nazis.   Turks in recent years have flocked to West Germany in search ofjobs, triggering resentment among many working-class Germans.Rightist groups have made foreign workers a political issue, andthe extremist Republican Party, campaigning on a platform opposedto foreign workers, recently made surprising gains in some WestGerman municipal elections.   ``They (the Turks) have assumed the role that the Jews played inthe Nazi ideology,'' Frisch said on the North German radio station.   Hitler was born in the two-story house on April 20, 1889 andspent the first three years of his life in Braunau, just miles fromthe West German border. He committed suicide in a bunker in Berlinon April 30, 1945, having ordered his body burned.   In 1979, neo-Nazis and left-wingers clashed in the villagebefore police broke up the rival groups. No serious injuries werereported then.   Police said three anonymous letters were received threateningviolence this year on the ``Hitler House,'' Socialist Mayor GerhardSkiba and an anti-fascist memorial opposite the house.   Skiba said the memorial, erected April 5, was intended to showthat Braunau's 10,000 residents oppose Nazism and remember itsmillions of victims. It was made of granite from the quarry onceworked by thousands of prisoners at the former Nazi concentrationcamp, Mauthausen.</TEXT></DOC>
