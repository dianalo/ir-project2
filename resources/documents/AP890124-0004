(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   This steel town has long been a four-letterword for all that's gone wrong in industrial America: a shrinkingworkforce, sooty skies, a sorry future.   With the city's fate tied to steel's fortunes, when the industryhurts, so does Gary. Now that steel is surging, this archetypal RustBelt city says it is on the mend, too.   Unemployment is down, companies are moving in, real estate isbeing snatched up. More importantly, Gary is looking beyond steel _a lakefront marina is planned and an airport project is being pushed.   ``We're on an upturn now,'' said Mayor Thomas Barnes. ``Theoptimism we feel is not because we've resolved the problems thatexist. It's because we're right now on a track to resolving them.There's growth as opposed to further decline. People are takinganother look at Gary.''   They will still find a depressed city _ shuttered stores, guttedhomes and a bleak downtown with no hotel or department store. Butthere also is new prosperity due, in part, to a leaner, profitablesteel industry that's been boosted by increasing demand, importlimits, the low dollar and new technology.   After losses of almost $12 billion in 1982-86, the industrynationwide earned $1 billion in 1987 and is expected to double thatfor 1988.   That improvement has contributed to an upturn in Gary and otherparts of northwestern Indiana, site of the world's greatestconcentration of steel-making capacity. For example:   _ Five steel companies in Porter and Lake counties, the latterincluding Gary, have spent more than $2.5 billion on theirfacilities since 1982, said the Indiana Steel Advisory Commission.   Indiana is America's No. 1 steel producer; 22 percent of thenation's steel is made there. The industry pumps almost $20 milliondaily into Indiana's economy.   _ Unemployment in the Gary-Hammond, Ind., area fell from 15.7percent in 1982-83 to 9.5 percent in 1987; the 1987 numbers wouldhave been lower but for a six-month walkout at USS Gary Works, thecity's biggest employer and flagship of USX Corp.   November's unemployment rate was 6.1 percent; 1988 was the firstyear this decade without double-digit employment in any month. Thosefigures, however, do not reflect huge population losses. The area'slabor force shrunk by 38,100 from 1980 to November 1988.   _ New and expanding businesses in the Gary area have filled 12.4million square feet of industrial space and created almost 6,500jobs since 1984. Much of the growth is steel-related.   Gary ``is one of the best heavy industrial locations inAmerica,'' said John Gates, an investor and redeveloper. ``You'reclose to all the major manufacturers in the United States. Most ofthese peoples' customers are nearby. You've got very inexpensiverents and real estate costs.   ``If someone needs steel, you're going to be near the biggest andcheapest source of supply nationwide,'' added Gates, who has helped24 companies, some from West Germany and Austria, expand or settlein the area.   The new-and-improved status may even be reflected in a 1988 Moneymagazine survey that ranked the Gary-Hammond area 41st among 300U.S. living spots _ two slots above considerably more picturesqueHonolulu and up from 92nd place a year earlier.   That might seem surprising, considering Gary's reputation asaging, crime-infested and polluted. City planner Taghi Arshami saysthat's more myth than reality, though he concedes Gary's centersection, with a vacancy rate equal to 20 acres, is devastated.   ``The problem we have generally for downtown is lack ofinvestment, lack of confidence on the part of business and on thepart of banks that are not willing to put the money down,'' he said.   But he is optimistic about developing Gary's downtown into apublic and service sector hub, noting that 12,000 people work there.   Some of Gary's image problems stem from lean times of the lastdecade. Jobs and people disappeared, unemployment soared. Gary'spopulation, now about 137,000, fell 10 percent from 1980 to 1986.Even now, experts say, growth in northwestern Indiana is occurringin rural areas.   The mills shrank, too, while becoming more efficient.Northwestern Indiana now has 35,300 steelworkers, a 47 percent dropfrom 1979. USS Gary Works has 7,500 workers, compared with21,000-22,000 in the late 1970s.   Although mill investments spur related business, some say Gary isin a precarious position because it remains so dependent on steel.   ``The danger of Gary is not that they aren't doing fairly well,''said Frank Cassell, professor emeritus of industrial relations atNorthwestern University. ``(But) they're likely to delude themselvesinto thinking that what they're doing is the most powerfulinfluence.''   Instead, he said, bigger factors are external _ demand, thedollar and the nation's economy. ``Gary is doing good work foritself. That's commendable,'' he said. ``(But) one doesn't want tothink that's the whole picture.''   Some business leaders concede the region has done a poor job ofdiversifying, but others point to such changes as the growth of thehealth industry, which provides 20,400 jobs in the area.   Gary is also touting recreation. Promotional brochures featurethe Indiana Dunes and Lake Michigan, photos of children bicyclingalong the beach, a golden sunset over shimmering waters and a localboy who made good _ Michael Jackson.   ``We have one of the largest fresh water bodies anywhere in theworld,'' Barnes said. ``We have far from taken full advantage ofit.''   Gary hopes to rectify that with an ambitious $150-$200 million,1,400-slip marina adjacent to the USS site that could eventuallyinclude a hotel, shopping center and amphitheater. Officials hope tobuild the first 250 slips this year.   Gary also hopes to have the third commercial airport in theChicago area. Its present airport provides only charter and privatecorporate service.   An expanded airport would relieve congestion at O'HareInternational and Midway in Chicago. One report said it wouldattract 6.5 million passengers to Gary annually and create 122,000jobs with a payroll of $1.6 billion.   Though these projects are critical, Barnes said the city also has``a much healthier manner of looking at problems,'' whether it'scleaning up illegal dumps or addressing housing needs.   ``There's already a renewed spirit of cooperation that hasn'texisted in 20 years,'' said Bill Brown, transportation planner forthe Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission.   ``People,'' he said, ``feel a lot more confident about Gary'sfuture.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Sharon Cohen is the AP Midwest regional reporter,based in Chicago.</TEXT></DOC>
