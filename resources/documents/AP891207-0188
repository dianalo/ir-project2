The door then will open for the departure from the presidency ofGen. Augusto Pinochet, who has ruled since the armed forcesoverthrew the government of Marxist Salvador Allende in 1973.   But it does not necessarily mean the 74-year-old general willfade away.   The election is seen as a vote on the Pinochet legacy, andvirtually all polls give the opposition a substantial lead over aright-wing candidate. But even Pinochet's critics are acceptingsome of the many profound changes brought by the military leader.   Three men are bidding to succeed Pinochet:   _Patricio Aylwin, a 71-year-old law professor and former Senatepresident, supported by a coalition of 17 moderate and leftistopposition parties.   _Hernan Buchi, 40, a former finance minister under Pinochetbacked by right-wing forces.   _Francisco Javier Errazuriz, 47, a wealthy, conservativebusinessman.   Voters also will pick 38 senators and 120 members of Congress'lower House of Deputies, a decisive step in the long road back todemocracy.   If no one wins the presidential race by more than 50 percent ofthe vote, a runoff will be held in January or February for the twofront-runners.   Aylwin has been given a commanding lead in virtually allpre-election surveys, and his two opponents acknowledge they are ina race against each other for the second runoff slot should Aylwinfail to win half the total vote.   The new government is scheduled to take office March 11.   Although the election is certain to bring radical changes to thepolitical life of Chile's 12 million people, much of thefree-market economic program crafted by Pinochet's administrationis expected to remain intact.   ``So far, our transition to democracy is the most peaceful, lesstraumatic in Latin America, and that's the result of a stableeconomy,'' said Jaime Ravinet, a close aide and spokesmen forAylwin.   ``That's why the platforms of all three candidates emphasize theneed for political changes to rebuild democracy, while, despitesome differences, agreeing on the need of maintaining an openeconomy,'' he said in an interview.   Chileans pitched themselves enthusiastically into the firstpresidential campaign since 1970, when Allende won by a slim margin.   Pinochet toppled the Allende government in a bloody coup Sept.11, 1973, during a period of social and political disorder.   In the current campaign, street vendors in the main cities havebeen doing a brisk business selling lapel pins, cigarette lighters,pens, stickers, match boxes and other objects with the names andphotos of the candidates.   Noisy motorcades have toured the streets, especially onweekends, with thousands of followers, mostly young people, wavingparty flags and promoting their candidates.   Hundreds of campaign rallies have been held throughout thecountry. A spokesman for the Aylwin campaign said the candidatemade as many as 15 speeches in a single day. Buchi ended hiscampaign with a marathon, 11-stop tour up and down the2,800-mile-long country.   Radio stations enjoyed a financial bonanza broadcasting thecandidates paid political advertising. Television time was limitedto 20 free minutes daily divided among the three presidentialcandidates, and the same amount for congressional contenders.   Authorities have reported only very sporadic and minor incidentsof violence. There was little of the open tension that was evidentwhen voters in an October 1988 referendum rejected a militaryproposal to extend Pinochet's presidential term to 1997. Thatdefeat forced Pinochet to call this presidential election.   The first years of Pinochet's rule were marked by harshrepression of leftists. Many were tortured and killed, andthousands were forced into exile. Human rights groups here andabroad say they have documented about 750 cases of dissidents whodisappeared after being arrested by secutity agents.   Dealing with the emotional demands for justice for human rightsviolations during the Pinochet years will be one of the mostsensitive problems facing the future government.   Pinochet has warned he will not allow trials of the military andthat ``if one of my men is touched, the state of law will bebroken.''   Aylwin has said he would deal with the problem ``combining thevirtues of justice and prudence,'' and ``we will not seek revenge,but truth and justice.''   Even after handing over the presidency, Pinochet will retainconsiderable power. He has vowed to remain as commander of thecountry's 60,000-man army until 1998, which is permitted by theconstitution written by his government in 1980. The opposition, andeven some moderate rightists and retired military officers, havecalled on Pinochet to retire.   Under Pinochet's instruction, the army command across the streetfrom the presidential palace is being refurbished, and Pinochet'sopponents fear it will be just one of several power bases he willcontinue to control.   His administration has been pushing through a series oflast-minute laws that would limit the powers of the futuregovernment.   ``As do all dictators, Pinochet is trying to leave essentialmatters firmly tied up after his departure,'' said Ricardo Lagos, asocialist and a leading opposition figure.   One new law gives the Central Bank autonomy in setting monetaryand credit policies. Pinochet, however, agreed to include twoopposition economists in the bank's five-member council.   Another law allowed Pinochet to create a National TelevisionCouncil to control the issuing of TV broadcasting licenses.   Yet to be passed is controversial legislation giving themilitary virtual independence. It prevents the government fromcutting the defense budget, limits the presidenti's power toappoint commanders-in-chief and strips the Senate of any right toapprove the promotions of generals and admirals.   The opposition has said it will work in the new Congress torepeal or change those laws.   Ravinet, Aylwin's spokesman, said one of the ``basic tasks'' ofthe new government will be ``to work in Congress along withdemocratic forces, even right-wing ones, to change thatlegislation.''   Pre-election surveys give Aylwin 47 percent to 57 percent of thetotal vote. His principal threat comes from Buchi, who is shown inthe polls with 27 percent to 37 percent of the vote. The pollsindicate Errazuriz has only a remote chance of capturing more thanabout 15 percent of the vote.   Buchi is credited with the economic policies that have producedfive years of growth, stability and low inflation and has wonpraise among bankers and businessmen at home and abroad.   However, the economic bonanza does not seem to be helping hiscampaign, in which he tried to stress his independence fromPinochet after 12 years in his administration.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Dec. 10</NOTE></DOC>
