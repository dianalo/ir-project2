The Rogers, Ark., poultry products producer said it will issue $600 of new 14% convertible subordinated debentures due 2008 for every $1,000 of existing 8% subordinated debentures convertible into Class B common stock. Hudson previously had offered $550 of new debentures. It has $19.6 million of the old debentures outstanding. Terms remain unchanged on the exchange offer for another $50.3 million of 8% subordinated debentures convertible into Class A common. Hudson also said the previously announced record date for the swap, July 14, would be used only to determine holders of the old debentures. The offer, when made, will be open to all holders of the debentures. </TEXT></DOC>
