With U.S. corn now more than 86% planted, the young cropis enjoying near-tropical conditions, including plentifulrain and high temperatures.</LP><TEXT>   Last year, unseasonably heavy rains in some corn beltareas delayed planting past the first week of June, thetraditional deadline for corn. The planting delay exertedupward pressure on futures prices throughout May and June.   This year, however, Nebraska's crop already is 98%planted, while Illinois corn is 96% planted. Only Iowa, whererain has muddied fields, lags behind, at about 70% planted.But 10 to 15 days remain before the traditional plantingdeadline, and analysts say Iowa farmers are likely to finishthe job soon.   &quot;Over the long weekend, people got a chance to get out oftown and take a look for themselves at the development of thecorn crop,&quot; said Warren King, grain analyst for CargillInvestor Services, Chicago. &quot;Things are better than somepeople thought.&quot;   The price of the corn contract for July delivery declined3.75 cents a bushel to settle at $2.4675 a bushel. The priceof the July wheat contract also dropped, settling down 2.25cents at $2.9125 a bushel.   Contributing to the price declines was continuinguncertainty over the Soviet Union's longstanding request formore credit to buy U.S. grains, including corn and wheat. TheSoviets have asked for an additional $1.5 billion in exportbonus credits.   A news service reported Monday that the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's delegation to the Soviet Union had returned andconcluded that the Soviet government is not worthy ofadditional credit. That report sent grain futures prices intodecline in early trading.   Not long after the opening of trading, the USDA denied thereport and said its delegation had not made anyrecommendation on the credit issue.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said lateryesterday that President Bush would make a policy statementon the Soviet Union during an address today at the U.S. AirForce Academy in Colorado, but grain traders were skepticalthat the address would produce any conclusive word on theSoviet credit issue. What's more, analysts said, the marketis tiring of the rumor mill's relentless churning and manytraders have begun to take a bearish view on the subject.   &quot;It's taken the USDA nearly two months to review thecredit issue,&quot; said Daniel Basse, director of market researchfor AgResource Co., Chicago. &quot;If they didn't have a problemwith the Soviets' credit-worthiness, then it wouldn't havetaken this long.&quot;   The price of the July soybean contract rose yesterday,settling up 3 cents at $5.77 a bushel. Analysts attributedthe increase to the shrinkage of world soybean stocks becauseof the small size of the Brazilian soybean crop.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil prices rose slightly in quiet trading,with no substantive news to drive prices in either direction.Many market participants were still on holiday, and fewtraders were willing to take big positions ahead of the June4 meeting of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries, even though little is expected from the meeting.Crude for July delivery ended at $21.33 a barrel, up 14 centsfrom Friday, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Thecontract traded in a narrow range between $21.22 a barrel and$21.40. The weekly inventory statistics from the AmericanPetroleum Institute that are normally released every Tuesdayafternoon are scheduled this week to be released todaybecause of the holiday.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Led by silver, precious metals futuresprices rose sharply. After trading as high as $4.21 an ounce,silver for July delivery ended at $4.175, up 12.5 cents. Junegold ended $6.90 an ounce higher at $363.70. July platinumrose $4.80 an ounce to finish at $397.60. Analysts attributedthe rise to a weaker dollar and technical factors. Traderswere encouraged that silver prices had held above $4 for 15consecutive sessions, said William O'Neill, futuresstrategist at Merrill Lynch. As the price rose, standing buyorders were triggered and pushed prices even higher, he said.But people aren't getting excited yet, said James Kneafsey,president of Cambridge Financial Management, a Cambridge,Mass., institutional money management firm, because they'rewaiting to see what happens today. Many U.S. and Europeantraders were out yesterday, he noted. Some overnight producerselling may cause prices to open slightly lower today, Mr.Kneafsey predicted, then rise to test $4.25 for silver and$370 for gold. Traders will be watching to see if prices holdup at the end of the day, he said, adding that they will feelmore comfortable about betting on further rises in gold andsilver if platinum climbs above $400. Because recent ralliesin the precious metals have failed to hold up, the market hasa credibility gap, said Mr. O'Neill. Producers showedrestraint yesterday, but they will continue to sell and limitthe upside potential of any rally, he predicted. But PeterCardillo, director of commodity research at Jesup Josephthalandamp; Co., is more optimistic. &quot;Today's action took the marketout of its doldrums,&quot; he said, adding that he sees silverrising to $4.27 to $4.28 and gold to $467.50 to $468.                                                                                                          COTTON: Bad weather in key cotton growing areas continuedto raise concerns about planting delays and the new cropsize. Heavy rain again kept farmers out of the fields in theMississippi Delta region last week, said Peter Leavitt,executive vice president of Weather Services Corp., Bedford,Mass. Drought-stricken West Texas received some rain lastThursday but in recent days the weather has been dry and hot,topping 100 degrees, he said. Plantings, as a result, didn'tmake much progress last week. Louisiana inched ahead to 62%of its cotton acreage planted through the end of last week,up just slightly from 59% the week before, according toMartin Owens, agricultural statistician of the NationalAgriculture Statistics Service, an agency of the Departmentof Agriculture. Mississippi had 45% planted as of last week,up from 33% a week earlier. Both Mississippi and Louisianaare well below their average of over 90% planted by this timeof year, Mr. Owens noted. Texas was 46% planted, well behindlast year's pace of 72% but near its average of 54%.Tennessee had 41% of its crop in, up sharply from the 18% ofthe week before. California is finished planting and Arizona,New Mexico and North Carolina are nearly done, said Mr.Owens. Overall, 59% of U.S. cotton acreage had been plantedas of the end of last week, up from 48% the week before, butfar behind the 82% of a year ago, he said. Farmers may getsome relief from the weather in the week ahead: The Delta isin for some drier weather and West Texas some rain, said Mr.Leavitt. The question now, said Ernest Simon, cottonspecialist at Prudential Securities, is how the late startwill affect yields. Even if better weather allows farmers toget the crop planted, production could be reduced, he said.Crop estimates, which at one time were as high as 17.5million to 18 million bales, are now falling to 16 millionand below, he said. Although he thinks the price could riseagain above 90 cents, Mr. Simon suspects it won't top the94.45 cent July life-of-contract high set last week. Julycotton ended 0.72 cent a pound lower at 89.30 cents, but allother months rose sharply, with December cotton ending at75.63 cents, up 1.51 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
