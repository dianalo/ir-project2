Mrs. Dole's blunt warning came as she formally presented the planto the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, setting theadministration strongly against a plan by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,D-Mass., and majority Democrats that would raise the hourly minimumto $4.65.   She contended the Democratic plan, similar to one that died underopposition by then-President Reagan last year, would cost 650,000jobs.   Bush's plan would raise the $3.35 minimum wage, unchanged since1981, by 30 cents an hour a year until it reaches $4.25 an hour in1991. All new workers hired at the minimum could be paid $3.35 anhour for the first six months of their employment.   ``Any more expansive approach at this time would be unacceptablebecause it would decrease job opportunities,'' Mrs. Dole said.``Legislation outside these parameters would call for a veto.''   Kennedy told Mrs. Dole he hoped that ``we're not getting hit witha take it or leave it.''   Mrs. Dole said bluntly, ``The president has signed up for $4.25an hour. and not higher.   ``$4.25 is it,'' she said, waving her hand.   The Labor committee will consider the bill Kennedy introducedwith Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, who has said he wants afloor debate and vote on the question by the end of the month.   Under the ``training wage,'' all workers hired at the minimumcould be paid $3.35 an hour for six months before they are coveredby the higher standard. Kennedy and other key Democrats andorganized labor have opposed setting a lower standard for anyworkers, which organized labor fears could cause companies to layoffhigher-paid workers in favor of those who can be paid less.   Twelve states and the District of Columbia have raised theminimum wage in laws that take precedence over the federal standardinside their borders, according to the Labor Department. Californiaand Connecticut have the highest minimum at $4.25 an hour, althoughD.C. has a $4.85 floor for some workers.   The other states with minimums higher than the federal governmentare Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire,Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
