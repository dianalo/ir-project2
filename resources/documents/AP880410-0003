A 1,000-officer task force flooded streets in gang areas Fridaynight, and Police Chief Daryl Gates ordered the officers out againSaturday night.   Between Saturday evening and 1:30 a.m. Sunday, police reported481 arrests, almost half of them on the gang-infested southside.About 190 of the arrestees were suspected gang members, Officer JoeMariani said.   At midevening Sunday, there were no reports of further masspolice action.   Task force officers made 592 arrests Friday night and Saturdaymorning during round one of the unprecedented crackdown on gangsthat have terrorized neighborhoods in the nation's second largestcity.   About half of those arrested during the first dragnet werebelieved to be gang members, police said.   Officials said figures were not available on how many of thosearrested in the sweep, code-named ``Fly the Flag,'' had beenreleased by Sunday afternoon.   It was the department's biggest attack ever on gangs, whichspecialize in the cocaine trade and were blamed for 205 killings inthe city of Los Angeles last year. Gang killings in all of LosAngeles County reached 387 last year.   About half the special force, formed by putting officers onovertime at a cost of $150,000 a day, went to augment regularpatrols in the south-central area, where gangs are the most active.The rest of the officers spread out citywide.   Two drive-by shootings were reported despite the policepresence, but investigators were not sure if they were gang-related.   Late Saturday, a 16-year-old boy was wounded by shots fired froma passing car. Hospital officials did not have a condition reportavailable Sunday. A dance hall security guard was killed by shotsfired from a car early Sunday, said Detective Richard Hoffman. Aman was detained in the shooting, he said.   During his weekly radio address, Gov. George Deukmejian saidthat when asked by police he will offer $10,000 rewards forinformation leading to the arrest and conviction of wanted gangmembers.   The governor also said he will sponsor the reintroduction oflegislation to increase penalties for drive-by shootings andteen-age killers.   ``All too often, victims and witnesses of gang violence arereluctant to provide authorities with information which could leadto the arrest of these killers,'' Deukmejian said.   While the task force was forming Saturday, tearful relativesburied a 19-year-old man gunned down on a sidewalk by gang memberson Good Friday. Neither the dead man nor the 12 others injured inthe bloody attack were gang members, according to police andrelatives.   ``This tragedy that has taken place, we should see that itdoesn't happen again by learning to love one another,'' said theRev. Lea Gibson.</TEXT></DOC>
