Jeffrey Lundgren, 39, a defrocked lay minister of theReorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Ohio;his wife, Alice, 38, and their son, Damon, 19, were expected to bearraigned Tuesday in Municipal Court on fugitive charges, said SanDiego County Deputy District Attorney John Hewicker.   Extradition proceedings were expected to follow later. ``Theyalready have said in their first meeting with investigators thatthey would fight extradition,'' Hewicker said.   The Lundgrens were arrested Sunday outside a motel in NationalCity about five miles south of San Diego by U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco and Firearms agents and police.   A cache of weapons, ammunition and paramilitary equipmentincluding gas masks were found in a motel room and a storage lockerin nearby Chula Vista.   Three other Lundgren children _ Kristen, 10, Caleb, 9, andJason, 15 _ were taken into protective custody, ATF spokeswomanApril Freud said Monday, declining to elaborate on theirwhereabouts.   ATF agents continued the hunt in Southern California for thelast two of the 13 suspects in the killings of Dennis Avery, hiswife, Cheryl; and their three young daughters. Law enforcementofficers looked for Kathryn Renee Johnson, 36, and Daniel DavidCraft, 25, who probably were with Lundgren last week, Freud said.   ``They were believed to have left San Diego Saturday and theyare in the Southern California area,'' she said.   In Cleveland, meanwhile, The Plain Dealer reported that Averyhad purchased three weapons for Lundgren three days before hisdeath.   Charles E. Wallace, assistant special agent in charge for Ohiofor the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said one ofthe weapons purchased by Avery, a .45-caliber pistol, may have beenthe murder weapon.   Avery visited a Chagrin Falls, Ohio, gun store last April 15 andpicked out a rifle and two pistols, Wallace told the Plain Dealerin a story published in Tuesday's editions.   The following day, Avery returned to the store with LuFdyren,who signed federal weapons purchase transaction forms, Wallacesaid. Avery charged the $1,300 cost to his credit card, Wallacesaid.   Wallace said ballistics tests must be conducted to determinewhether one of the pistols was the murder weapon. Autopsies showedeach of the victims was shot several times with a .45-caliberweapon.   One of the weapons seized near San Diego matched a descriptionof one of the pistols purchased by Avery the day before he died,Wallace said.   Freud said Lundgren had been in the San Diego area for at leasta month before his arrest, but didn't know where he'd been stayingor if his family had been with him then.   Mrs. Lundgren checked into the motel Wednesday night with thethree children, saying she'd been arguing with her husband.   Searches of the motel room and the locker uncovered numerousweapons, including two assault rifles, 1,000 rounds of ammunition,an assortment of knives, several gas masks and gas containers, 40pounds of powder for reloading ammunition and other types ofparamilitary equipment and camping gear, Freud said.   ``He seems to have packaged up all his weapons and ammunitionand taken them with him, along with his personal effects,'' shesaid. ``It appeared that he kept four firearms with him and keptthe other firearms and various types of paramilitary equipmentstashed somewhere else.   ``We now will be trying to trace the weapons, trying todetermine who purchased them and the most recent documentation ofwho the owners might have been,'' Freud said.   She said authorities were still trying to determine why Lundgrenwas in San Diego since his only tie to the city was Navy servicethere 15 years ago.   Lundgren broke away from the Reorganized Church and persuadedother members to follow him. The group once lived on a 15-acre farmnear Kirtland, Ohio, where bodies believed to be those of theAverys were unearthed last week.   Investigators believe the Averys were killed in April and buriedin a common barn under the barn near the Cleveland-area town theday before Lundgren and his followers fled to a farm near Holden,Mo.   Lundgren and 12 followers were indicted in the killings.   Authorities were led to the National City motel by telephonecalls made from a pay phone to another location under surveillance,said Steven C. LaTourette, a prosecutor in Lake County, Ohio.   LaTourette has said that the Averys apparently were killed in asacrificial ritual that would allow the cult to relocate to thewilderness.   But Dale Luffman, president of the northeast Ohio chapter of theReorganized Church, said the slayings may have resulted fromdisputes over money, sex or fear the Averys would leave the cult.   Lundgren was stripped of his credentials as a lay minister withthe church in 1987 after he began preaching radical doctrines. Heand others who followed him left the church and eventually settledon the farm near Kirtland.   The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,based in Independence, Mo., has roots and some beliefs in commonwith the Salt Lake City-based Mormon Church but is separate.</TEXT></DOC>
