Robert Dole is standing beneath 12 chandeliers and speaking to the annual Lincoln-McKinley Banquet.    He warns the 400 people who have crowded into the peach-colored ballroom in the Hyatt at Capitol Square that the Iran-Contra affair &quot;is going to be around for a while.&quot; He talks about the federal budget, the prospects for a trade bill and the new proposals for welfare overhaul. And more than a dozen times the audience explodes in laughter at his quips.    &quot;He's won the audience,&quot; Stephen Swaim, a Columbus attorney, says to his dinner partner. &quot;But he's got to concentrate more on a dream for the future.&quot;    Vice President George Bush's ties to the Iran-Contra affair and Howard Baker's acceptance of the top White House staff job have catapulted Mr. Dole into the front rank of Republican presidential contenders. The nomination, many political analysts believe, now is his to lose.    But he faces a major challenge: Can he transform his public bearing from legislative technician to presidential candidate?    No sitting legislator has been elected president since the onset of television politics and party reform. No one questions Mr. Dole's mastery of the details of government and his quick wit, but it still isn't clear whether he will be able to project vision, to talk less about committee action and more about conviction.    The entreaties to add a broader vision and a rhetorical lilt to the candidate's appeal -- to force a speaker accustomed to the Senate chamber to project his voice to a national audience -- are plainly jarring to Mr. Dole, who is uncomfortable with the touch of Tennyson that crept into the political speeches of the Kennedy brothers or with the lines from Lincoln that are the staples of Republican speeches. Such soaring rhetoric strikes him as contrived, cheap.    &quot;I've given the broad speeches with the quotes,&quot; says Sen. Dole as his Lear 25 jet banks over this city, long a GOP stronghold. &quot;I can take it in moderation. But I don't want to be filled up with vision. I want to have some specific things to say. Quoting John Kennedy is one thing, but being someone who believes in things -- help for senior citizens, the homeless, the handicapped -- is more important. I'm not short on vision. I want to make things better.&quot;    Mr. Dole's campaign now is the principal magnet of Republican voters who, in response to the Iran scandal, believe that experience, competence and decisive leadership are the chief attributes to be sought in a successor to President Reagan. &quot;Sure he's an insider,&quot; says Pamela Enis, vice president of the Cardinal Group of Funds, an investment firm here, &quot;but that makes me think he's more in the know.&quot;    But some political analysts believe that unless Sen. Dole takes on a presidential voice rather than a legislative voice -- one calculated to move public opinion rather than lawmakers -- he faces the danger of becoming the political equivalent of the New Hampshire mountains where his appeal will be tested in next February's primary: impressive but cold and barren.    &quot;He has to build a bridge from being a senator to a presidential campaigner,&quot; says Thomas Sweeney, a political scientist at Coe College in Iowa, where Mr. Dole hopes a strong showing in the first 1988 presidential caucuses will give his campaign momentum. &quot;It's a much different way to talk, particularly in Iowa. You won't show up in the papers if you only talk congressional jargon.&quot;    The debate over whether the candidate's appearances should be infused with a broader message has disrupted the Dole organization just as it has begun to hit its stride, and the resulting power struggle will determine both the content of the Dole campaign and the personnel who will direct it. &quot;Mere competence is not going to get you the nomination,&quot; warns John Sears, a GOP consultant and the principal advocate of providing the campaign with an overarching, thematic message.    But David Keene, another top political adviser, argues that Mr. Dole's appeal doesn't need a drastic overhaul. &quot;The goal is not really developing a vision,&quot; he says. &quot;It's changing the way you talk about things. It means taking the 30,000 votes he's cast and deciding what three things it all means.&quot;    Mr. Dole has called on Robert Ellsworth, a former congressman and U.S. ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to head his campaign, to quell the internal disputes and to determine whether Mr. Sears prevails and finds a place in the campaign.    At the same time, Mr. Dole, the political heir of the traditional McKinley-Taft brand of conservatism so popular here in Ohio, has been polishing his hard-right credentials.    &quot;No one's trying harder to be a conservative than Dole, but he's going to find it's a hard case to make for himself,&quot; says Glenn Kenton, an aide to another GOP aspirant, former Gov. Pierre du Pont of Delaware. In a front-page editorial this winter, the Manchester (N.H.) Union Leader, whose endorsement Mr. Dole believes he can win, surveyed the GOP field and noted that the senator &quot;has an unfortunate record of voting for taxes.&quot;    Sen. Dole's legislative record may help him here. &quot;The right wing remembers he tried to deal them in when he was majority leader,&quot; says Kevin Phillips, a Republican political theorist. &quot;They have a sense he kept his word.&quot;    But the candidate's premier struggle isn't whether he can adjust his ideology but whether he can adjust to the changed political circumstances that make him, not Vice President Bush, the favorite for the GOP nomination.    Sen. Dole believes the adjustments must come slowly. &quot;If I want to raise support in an audience, I first have to establish that I know something,&quot; he says. &quot;I have to push the 'budget' and 'trade' buttons. Later on I can broaden that out. But I don't need to do that right now.&quot;    But Mr. Dole, who wasn't an avid reader as a young man, has been following a reading list prescribed by Daniel Boorstin, the Librarian of Congress and a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian. The man who once joked that he stood before Republican audiences and read them the legislative schedule is dipping into biographies of Washington, Jefferson and the Roosevelts, reading period histories, trying to develop a broad view of the nation's origins. </TEXT></DOC>
