Part 791of the Export Administration Regulations establishes the procedures andcriteria for assessing foreign availability. The Secretary of Commerceor his designee is authorized by statute to determine foreign availability.In any case in which the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administrationdetermines that an item of comparable quality to a U.S. item controlledfor national security purposes is available-in-fact to a controlled countryfrom a foreign source in quantities sufficient to render the control ineffectivein meeting its purposes, under EAA section 5(f)(1)(A), the Secretary maynot require a validated license for its export.On April 18, 1989, OFA formally undertook a foreign availability assessmentof prepreg production equipment based on a foreign availability submission.This equipment is controlled for national security reasons under ECCN 1357A(e)and is also controlled for foreign policy reasons in accordance with themultilateral Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).OFA completed the assessment on prepreg production equipment and on August18, 1989, I made a positive determination of foreign availability. In accordancewith section 5(f)(3)(b) of the EAA, the determination was provided forreview to the Departments of State and Defense as well as other interestedagencies of the U.S. Government. This determination was not affected bythe interagency review.On September 15, 1989, the President determined that export controls onthis equipment must be maintained notwithstanding foreign availability,because their absence would prove detrimental to the national securityof the United States. The President will actively pursue negotiations withsource countries, as required by EAA section 5(f)(4), for the purpose ofeliminating such availability. The Secretary of State, in consultationwith the Secretaries of Commerce and Defense, has been delegated the authorityto conduct such negotiations by the President. While negotiations to eliminatethe foreign availability to national security controlled countries aretaking place, the current license requirements will remain in place.If OFA receives substantive new evidence affecting this foreign availabilitydetermination, the assessment will be reevaluated. Inquiries concerningthe scope of this assessment may be directed to the Office of Foreign Availabilityat the above address. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 15, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James M.
