It seemed like a natural: The U.S. was desperately in need of more low-income housing, and investors, thanks to tax reform, were desperately in need of ways to avoid the tax man.    In fact, Congress was so worried about the credit's expected popularity -- and its effect on the Treasury -- that it limited the amount of credits that could be doled out to $300 million a year.    It needn't have bothered.    Last year, investors used less than a fifth of the allowable credits -- and produced far less housing than was hoped for. This year, they will use an estimated 50% to 60% of the $300 million allowed, still far below expectations.    And just as the credit is starting to produce some housing, it's threatened with extinction. The program expires at the end of 1989. To qualify for a tax credit, a developer must build and rent his project before then.    &quot;It's kind of a sham,&quot; says Mike Evans, a San Francisco-based partner in the accounting firm Arthur Young andamp; Co. &quot;In California, it takes three years to do a project.&quot;    Mr. Evans continues: &quot;There are so many hurdles to go through. A lot of our developer clients have asked us about it, and when you walk them through the regulations, they say 'forget it.' &quot;   Nonetheless, housing advocates desperately want the program extended for a simple reason: It's all they've got. Federal aid for low-income housing has been cut by an estimated 75% in the Reagan years.    &quot;To shut down the federal government's only low-income housing program is absurd,&quot; says Benson Roberts, an executive for the Local Initiatives Support Corp., a nonprofit group that assists inner-city developers. &quot;We need breathing room to make it work.&quot;    Sens. George Mitchell (D., Maine) and John Danforth (R., Mo.) have convened a task force of developers and others to find out why the credit isn't working and to recommend changes. In the interim, they and allies in the House are trying to pass a bill to extend the credit, as is, for one year.    However, the Treasury opposes an extension, at least for now. &quot;It will be tough {politically} to make it permanent,&quot; a spokesman for Sen. Danforth says. &quot;But a short-term experiment isn't appropriate&quot; for a long-term, pervasive problem like the shortage of low-income housing, he says.    Supporters say the credit, while imperfect, has its virtues. It's about the only vehicle luring private capital into low-income housing -- an area abandoned by most developers. Credits have been used to rehabilitate a derelict home for squatters in New York, to convert a boarded-up school in Maryland into housing and to develop new low-income housing in Florida swamps and Minnesota farmland.    Under the program, developers get annual 9% credit for money spent building or rehabilitating housing and a 4% credit for money spent on acquiring property. The credits last 10 years, but rents have to be kept affordable to the poor, according to a federal formula, for 15 years.    Typically, syndicators package credits from groups of developers and market them to the public. William Holland, a Panama City, Fla., developer, built 130 low-income apartments in northern Florida and marketed them via American Holdings Inc., a New York syndicator.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. has a limited partnership offering on the market now, a $25 million package of low-income units around the country. Investors who put up $10,000 can expect a $1,600 tax credit annually for 10 years. After 15 years, the partnership can raise the rents or sell the units.    An earlier $80 million Shearson limited partnership was fully subscribed. But many syndicators are having a tough time. Century Pacific Corp., a Los Angeles syndicator, sold only 40% of a $50 million low-income housing fund, Larry Ross, Century's attorney, says.    The credits are a tough sell. They are illiquid and, by law, no individual investor can buy more than $7,000 of credits in any year. People with incomes of $200,000 can only take partial advantage of the credits, and people with incomes of $250,000 or more can't use them at all.    &quot;The market is so narrow,&quot; says Neal Crispin, president of Capital Management Associates, a San Francisco syndicator that decided not to market the low-income housing credits. &quot;You have to find people who are certain they won't make $200,000 anytime in the next 10 years.&quot; Mr. Roberts, the Local Initiatives official, calls it &quot;the tax credit for the downwardly mobile.&quot;    Some nonprofit developers are raising money from corporations, which also can use the tax credits, but results have been slow. Andrew Ditton, a fund-raiser with Local Initiatives, says that after he made a pitch to &quot;one of the largest corporations in this country&quot; about a small, carefully selected low-income housing project, &quot;the chief financial officer turned to the president and said, 'Why would we invest in slums?' &quot; But Mr. Ditton says the company eventually agreed to invest in the project.    Developers have another worry, because the size of the tax credit isn't enough to compensate them for the loss of normal market rents. Usually, the credits work only when they can be packaged with local subsidies or private grants, and there aren't many of those around.    &quot;It isn't a free-standing housing program,&quot; says Nicolas Retsinas, who heads the state housing and mortgage agency in Rhode Island. &quot;The numbers just aren't there.&quot;    Most of the new low-income housing being built with tax credits is in rural areas, where land is cheaper. In the cities, where the need is greatest, developers are using the credit to rehabilitate existing housing -- some vacant, some not.    The nonprofit Boston Housing Partnership, for instance, raised $16 million to rehabilitate 938 units, 70% of which are currently occupied.    Used to rehabilitate existing units, the credits keep housing from deteriorating. But critics say the credits aren't doing much to add to the overall housing supply. Charles Henderson, a Shearson senior vice president, concedes, &quot;What we're doing now is a holding action.&quot;    Another problem is that the Treasury has yet to issue complete regulations on how the credit works, which makes developers reluctant to go ahead. Mr. Evans of Arthur Young says the Treasury would love to see the low-income tax credit fail. A Treasury official close to the program denies that, but the official admits that &quot;low-income housing doesn't have the priority of certain other items.&quot;    However, the credit's many supporters in Congress are out to change that. Joe Gale, an aide to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D., N.Y.), says that &quot;since the market won't build low-income housing, this should be the starting point for the next administration.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
