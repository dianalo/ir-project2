(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>BUYER'S GUIDE Word processorsandM;Word processing is one of the most universal PC applications -- virtuallyeveryone needs to write text from time to time.andP;  In this Buyer's Guide welook at a number important word processing features, and whether they'reavailable on particular packages.andM;We also look at two packages from outside the 'big name' brigade: Protext, abudget package which started out on home micros and Volkswriter 3.2, amid-range word processor with good graphics facilities.andM;Operating systemandM;If you want to move to OS/2 or Unix in the future, it's worth checking thatyour established word processor is going to be available under thoseoperating systems as well, and if possible, when your supplier will completethe rewrite.andP;  A few packages already run on a range of different platforms.andM;Memory requirementsandM;Our figures say what the program needs; it's worth asking if running at theminimum impairs the program's performance.andP;  Often a program will run fasterwith extra memory.andM;Disk-based tutorialandM;Often users are expected to work on example files while following a paperbased tutorial.andP;  It's better to have a program which provides onscreeninstructions and prompts.andM;Keyboard templateandM;This is usually a flimsy piece of plastic which sticks onto the keyboardbeside the function keys stating briefly which key to press in order to issuea particular command.andP;  If well designed, it's a combination of life-saver andcomfort blanket.andM;Onscreen helpandM;An on-screen version of the keyboard template.andP;  Volkswriter uses one forbasic function key uses, for example.andP;  Protect provides a range of optionalscreen prompts.andM;Context-sensitive helpandM;With a context-sensitive system you hit a help key (usually F1) and theprogram automatically presents information relevant to the job that you're inthe middle of doing.andM;Windows availableandM;Many word processors allow you to work on several documents at once, each inits own 'window' (sometimes called a 'buffer').andP;  Windows may be full-screen,or it may be possible to display several at the same time.andM;Transfer dataandM;Copying text from window should be no more complicated than moving or copyingtext within a single document.andM;Text reformatandM;Text is altered by adding or deleting words.andP;  Doing this means altering theline-breaks.andP;  Nowadays most word processors automatically adjust the linebreaks while a paragraph is being edited, so that the chosen layout ispreserved.andP;  Some word processors require users to issue a 'reformatparagraph' command when editing is finished.andM;WYSIWWYGandM;What you see is what you get: the document looks, while you're editing it,how it will appear on paper.andP;  This can only be done by drawing a screen imageof the printed page (see Page Preview).andP;  In practice, WYSIWYG means differentthings to different people.andP;  At its most basic the line breaks on paper willcorrespond to the line breaks on-screen.andP;  At best, users see something like aphotograph of the page, with margins, typestyles and sizes shown to scale.andM;IndentsandM;These allow a paragraph (or just its first line) to be set in from the leftmargin by a standard amount without users having to remember to hit a tab keyat the start of the line.andM;PrintingandM;If the printer can handle it, the program should be able to set selected textfor printing with some sort of emphasis or special positioning.andP;  Subscripttext prints below the line, superscript above.andP;  Proportional printing spacescharacters along the line in proportion with the width of the characteritself--an &quot;i&quot; takes up less space than an 'm'.andP;  Proportionally printed textlooks neater than 'monospace' text.andM;Print spoolingandM;The program prints the file 'in the background', allowing you to get on withthe important job of editing.andM;LaserJet supportandM;Any software can print simple, unformatted text on a LaserJet.andP;  Control offancy typestyles and graphics needs more complicated software, and somesuppliers expect users to tackle the fiddly bits.andP;  As with PostScriptsupport, LaserJet support is a matter of degree.andM;PostScript supportandM;This should mean being able to print with printer-resident fonts and fontsdownloaded from disk; fonts should be printable in any size, but many wordprocessors can only work in relatively small sizes.andP;  Fonts and graphicsshould also be printable with a range of specialist effects -- as outlines,for example, or in shades of grey.andM;MailmergeandM;The ability to take a standard letter, and a data file full of informationabout specific recipients, combining the two to print a mailshot of'personalized' letters to each individual in the data file.andM;SpellcheckandM;The program runs through a document, checking every word against itsdictionary of correct spellings.andP;  The bigger the dictionary, the less oftenit will stop at words which are simply unknown to it.andM;ThesaurusandM;An on-screen equivalent of the paper-based thesaurus.andP;  Highlight a word, callup the thesaurus, and it offers a list of words similar in meaning to thehighlighted word.andM;CalculationandM;Some programs can carry out simple calculations.andP;  A column of figures typedinto the text can be added (or multiplied, or whatever) with the result shownautomatically.andM;MacrosandM;Macros are sequences of keystrokes which are recorded either on disk or inthe micro's memory.andP;  The whole sequence can be replayed by pressing aparticular key (typically an alphabetic key in combination with ALT or CTRL).andM;Command menuandM;A list of commands displayed on-screen.andP;  Commands can be highlighted with thecursor and pressing Enter issues the command.andM;Mouse supportandM;Many words processors still don't support a mouse, but where they do, themouse can speed up command selection, and is particularly good for markingout blocks of text.andM;GraphicsandM;Some word processors can import graphics for printing alognside text, butdon't actually show the image on-screen--using a small tag of some sort toindicate where they'll appear.andP;  Check the format of the graphics files youwant to use to be sure the word processor supports it.andM;Style sheetsandM;These may simply define margins or line spacing for the whole document.andO;Properly speaking, style sheets allow a range of paragraph formats --'styles' -- to be defined, including typestyles, justification and so on.andO;Styles are added to particular text with shortcut keystrokes (often called'paragraph tagging'), and revising the specification for a particular stylewill automatically reformat all paragraphs according to the style that's beenapplied.andM;Word countandM;Essential for professional writers, as it's the only reliable measure of thelength of any one document.andM;Page previewandM;A graphic display of the page as it'll appear when printed.andP;  The previewusually has to be switched on and off, and the document can't be edited whilethe preview image is on-screen.andP;  Often the text itself is too small to readin preview mode, and is 'greeked', with small blocks representing each wordso that the overall appearance of each paragraph can be judged.andM;Save as you workandM;Text should be saved to disk frequently, so that a power failure or computererror causes only a minimum of text to be lost.andP;  Some programs canautomatically save the current documents to disk every few minutes.andM;dBase import/exportandM;dBase is the most widely used database file format.andP;  Many database programscan export files in dBase format.andP;  Many word processors can use dBase filesas data files for mailmerge.andM;Lotus import/exportandM;Lotus 1-2-3 is the main spreadsheet file format, and can also hold databaseinformation.andP;  It's useful if you can exchange tabular data between wordprocessors and spreadsheets.andP;  Some word processors can read specifiedsections of spreadsheet files directly.andM;Additional featuresandM;These can be almost anything; packages which aspire to DTP-like status mayprovide font software for downloading to a printer, or clip-art libraries(small ready-to-use images).andP;  Ami Professional can produce charts fromnumbers, and includes a set of drwing tools.andP;  Wordbench includes tricks andtools for defeating writer's block.andM;ProtextandM;Protext is a command-driven word processor.andP;  Hitting ESC switches it intocommand mode, a prompt appears in the lower third of the screen, and a seriesof commands, similar in format to DOS commands, can be typed.andP;  The functionsof several DOS commands are reproduced; 'cat' is the equivalent of 'dir', forexample.andM;These days command-driven word processors have rather an antique air.andP;  Fortouch typists who know their way around a program they can be an efficientway to issue commands, but stumble-fingered learners frequently feelclueless.andM;Protext doesn't have the sort of intelligence which heavier programs use tospeed up the command system - Wordcraft, for example, can guess a command asthe keystrokes land on the command line, and once it's guessed correctly youjust hit Enter to confirm.andM;If command mode sounds too much like raw DOS, there's menu system, but it'sponderous - you have to switch away from the editing screen to a separatemenu screen.andP;  If menus still sound disarmingly simple and modern it's worthbearing in mind that many settings which affect the document as a whole aremade by entering cryptic, WordStar-style marginal commands into the textitself.andP;  'TM8', for example, sets the depth of the top margin to eight lines.andM;Cursor movement is swift and most commands are sensible.andP;  Nevertheless, Ikept tripping up over niggling little foibles-the program can't backspaceacross a line-break, for example, which puts it in a category of its own.andO;Just to be inconsistent, it does manage to back-space-delete across aline-break.andP;  Protext can use the mouse, but only for repositioning thecursor, not for marking blocks of text or issuing commands.andM;The manual gives a good introduction to the general principles of wordprocessing, assuming no previous computer experience.andP;  The bottom of thescreen can be use to provide a prompt for selected commands, cycling throughcommands for cursor movement, insertion and deletion and so on.andM;Support of laser printers is minimal and justification is rather crude, butthe package's foreign language support is reasonable.andM;The first micro I actually owned was an Amstrad CPC464, the machine for whichProtext was first developed.andP;  Those were dark days, before I bought my firstdisk drive (before Amstrad made disk drives) and everything was ratherprimitive.andP;  Using Protext brought it all back.andP;  Even on a 386 machine with aVGA screen and with a laser printer hooked up and a disk full of soft fontsit felt just like those long-gone days staring at the CPC.andP;  Dear reader, ifyou want to get a feel for how awful it used to be, buy Protext.andM;* PLUS Cursor movement is quick.andP;  Disks are a particularly attractive shadeof black.andP;  Made in Peterborough.andP;  Otherwise it's so bad it's funny.andM;* MINUS Awkward editing, poor printer control, clumsy justification,uncomfortable screen layout.andM;VolkswriterandM;Volkswriter has been around for a long time.andP;  It's never had star status inthe way that WordStar once did, or WordPerfect now does, but in the daysbefore DTP and graphic user interfaces it was always one of the sensiblealternatives to those two packages.andM;In fact, its feel is rather like a cross between the two.andP;  The relationshipbetween particular commands and particular function keys is quite arbitrary,as in WordPerfect, but with a memory jogger (Volkswriter's is an optionalonscreen listing) it's a simple enough system.andP;  Screen display is a littlecluttered by default, but there's a clean screen option.andM;Volkswriter also uses ye olde worlde WordStar-style dot commands.andP;  In fact,Volkswriter's are dot dot commands.andP;  For example,..Language German, placed atthe left-hand edge of the document, will cause all the subsequent text to bechecked against a German dictionary rather than the default (which,reassuringly for the non-polyglot, is English).andM;In fact spell-checking has always been one of Volkswriter's strengths; it hasa large dictionary, and is particularly well-tuned to English as it's spokenand cursed with.andP;  The package includes a voucher for a freebie alternativedictionary of your choice - options cover most European languages.andP;  Foreignlanguage thesauruses are available too.andM;Over the years the program evolved steadily, in line with the othertraditional heavyweights, until Total Word was launched.andP;  This was to beVolkswriter for the laser/DTP era, and was a disaster.andP;  The company hassensibly held on to the previous version, kept the traditional style, andcontinued to work on the small details which make the difference in routinework.andM;These are now quite unexceptional - details such as picking files to edit bypointing to a directory listing, or paragraphs auto-reformatting while you'reediting.andP;  The main point is that Volkswriter was a little rusty in some ofthese areas, and now it isn't.andM;Apart from that, the program's traditional strengths and weaknesses remain.andO;Apart from spell-checking, the program's main strength is its speed.andP;  It canhold large documents in memory, and can work on colossal documents byspooling text out to disk.andP;  Even when spooling to disk it's fast, but withall the text in memory, it's blindingly fast.andM;The main weaknesses are, firstly, mailmerge.andP;  Volkswriter's mailmerge ishorrible.andP;  You have to work with comma-delimited files, and there's no helpin creating them beyond normal editing facilities - which makes itappallingly easy to reformat a whole mass of records into one unuseableparagraph.andP;  In practice, this means that you need a decent database package -which heavy users of mailmerge probably have anyway.andP;  It's the occasionalusers who suffer.andM;The other weakness, in common with most word processors of Volkswriter's era,is laser support.andP;  The latest version of Volkswriter is the first to supportPostScript-one of the two main standards for lasers-and even then support isminimal, with each font set up as if it were a separate printer, and with alimited range of font sizes.andP;  Working with HP fonts is also awkward, and alllaser printing involves you in some degree of obscure fiddling.andM;The truth is, however, that none of the traditional word processors, with thepossible exception of Microsoft Word and the Macintosh programs are strong inthis area.andP;  The sensible approach in the PC is to use the word processor fortext-editing and for routine printing, then buy a DTP package.andO;Alternatively, buy Samna's Ami and accept slow performance on powerfulhardware.andM;* PLUS Speed, spelling checker, good all-around editing.andM;* MINUS Mailmerge, laser support, old-style dot commands are rather awkward.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
