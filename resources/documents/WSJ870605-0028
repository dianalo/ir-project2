That success can be glimpsed in the plans for a public offering of some Beatrice assets in a vehicle called E-II Holdings, whose preliminary prospectus was released May 21.    The document suggests that if the E-II offering fetches its proposed price of $15 to $18 a share, most equity investors in the leveraged buyout already will have stock valued at 2.7 to 5 times what they paid. These investors are mainly institutions led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which arranged the buyout. They put up $409 million to acquire 63.5% equity on a fully diluted basis in BCI Holdings, the successor company to Beatrice, last year.    A few participants have done even better. A partnership owned primarily by Drexel Burnham Lambert and its executives, who sold $2.5 billion of BCI junk bonds to help finance the buyout, acquired warrants to buy 24% of BCI stock. BCI managers led by Donald Kelly bought 1% of the stock and were granted options for an additional 11.5%. The percentages are also on a fully diluted basis.    Depending on how BCI shares are valued, the Drexel warrants, which cost a total of $8 million, could be valued at $300 million to $650 million. To make the deal even sweeter for Mr. Kelly and a few other managers, BCI paid them enough to cover the $7.1 million cost of their stock in return for their help in putting the deal together. Assuming exercise of the options, Mr. Kelly's own 7.5% stake could be worth $140 million or more.    Like most companies that go through leveraged buyouts, BCI, a gargantuan food and consumer products company with about $14 billion of annual revenue, scrambled to cut costs and sell assets to pay down its debt.    Mr. Kelly exercised his deal-making skills by selling six main units for about $3.6 billion, paring an initial $6.9 billion debt load to $3.3 billion. By one rough measure, he got a good price: The units brought in an amount equal to 60% of the buyout price for assets that accounted for only 40% of BCI's sales.    Mr. Kelly also slashed administrative costs to $90 million from $190 million by cutting staff, ditching a $20 million car racing sponsorship and scrapping the &quot;We're Beatrice&quot; corporate ads while keeping ads that plugged individual brands.    But luck played a role as well. Interest rates fell after acquisition terms were settled in February 1986. And stock prices rose, implicitly increasing the value of BCI Holdings' equity. Even the falling dollar boosted BCI's overseas sales.    The buyout investors led by Kohlberg Kravis paid $5 apiece for 81.4 million BCI shares, and the warrant and option holders can buy another 57.7 million at $5. Each BCI holder gets one new E-II share for every three BCI shares.    E-II represents about 20% of BCI's remaining assets at the end of February, according to the prospectus. So if E-II trades at $15, BCI holders would be getting stock worth their entire original investment for only about one-fifth of the company -- implying that their stock's value has multiplied five-fold.    Beatrice Senior Vice President Bill Reidy cautions that the E-II stock may sell at a premium because Mr. Kelly plans to use it as the vehicle for his future wheeling and dealing. In fact, he plans to step down soon as chief executive officer of BCI.    If the remainder of BCI is valued at 10 times cash flow, it would be worth about $1.9 billion, according to pro forma figures in a circular seeking bondholders' consent to the E-II offering. At that level, investors who bought in at $5 a share would have shares worth $13.66, or 2.7 times their investment.    Food analyst William Leach of Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette cites one factor that helped Kohlberg Kravis do the buyout at a reasonable price: Under previous management, Beatrice made big purchases whose steep goodwill charges artificially depressed reported earnings and hurt the stock price.    It also helped that Kohlberg Kravis stepped in to bid during a period of confusion following the firing of former Beatrice Chairman James Dutt. &quot;All the chaos at the top masked the underlying value at the operating level,&quot; says Mr. Reidy.    Mr. Leach considers the E-II offering &quot;a clever way of getting rid of all the miscellaneous businesses at a reasonably good valuation. They're packaging it as 'the Don Kelly portfolio' instead of as an ongoing company.&quot;    E-II will include the non-food businesses BCI hasn't already sold plus some smaller specialty-food lines. Beatrice has already sold its International Playtex personal products unit, its Avis car rental unit, and a refrigerated warehouse unit.    The Beatrice bonds have also done well. Robert Long, director of high yield research at First Boston, says the most junior issue had a 50% return in a period when high yield bonds returned only 9.9%.    One of the biggest holders of BCI bonds was Drexel itself. Sources familiar with the deal said Drexel got the warrants thinking they might serve as an inducement to bond buyers, but kept the majority because the bonds didn't sell as briskly as expected. Drexel also received $86.2 million in fees for underwriting the bonds. </TEXT></DOC>
