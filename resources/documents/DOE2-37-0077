<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-37-0077 </DOCNO><TEXT>Two flow problems are studied using spectral methods: the stability oftwo-dimensional Rayleigh convection in a box (with weak corner singularities)and the driven-cavity problem (with strong corner singularities). Comparedto the usual stream function/vorticity formulation, the single fourth-orderequation for stream function used here requires half the number of coefficientsfor this formulation and does not require iterative treatment of boundaryconditions. The Rayleigh-convection stability problem represents a self-adjointsystem. Three different spectral methods are used. A true Galerkin procedureis required to avoid spurious eigenvalues and obtain accurate results.It was found that poor convergence of pseudospectral coefficients iscaused by a Runge-like phenomenon near the walls. However, the weakersingularity in the Rayleigh-convection problem does not need to be treatedspecifically. An overdetermined pseudospectral method was developed,with special consideration of corner singularities, for a two-dimensionalviscous flow problem. The rate of convergence is greatly improved bysubtracting the strongest corner singularities.</TEXT></DOC>
