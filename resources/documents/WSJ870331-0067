Under the agreement, Damon will make tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA, for clinical trials and for marketing. SmithKline will conduct clinical trials, take responsibility for regulatory submissions and have exclusive marketing rights to the drug world-wide, except in Japan. Earlier this year, Damon signed a separate agreement with Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Japan, to sell tPA in that country.    SmithKline, a Philadelphia-based drug maker, is expected to begin clinical trials with tPA soon, Damon added.    With the agreement, the companies join a growing list of concerns that are racing to bring tPA to market. The drug is expected to be biotechnology's first blockbuster, and some analysts predict its annual sales could reach $1 billion or more within a few years. South San Francisco, Calif.-based Genentech Inc. is the clear-cut leader in the race -- the Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve Genentech's tPA for marketing during the next few months.    Damon Biotech, a majority-owned subsidiary of Damon Corp., is a Needham Heights, Mass.-based biotechnology concern. </TEXT></DOC>
