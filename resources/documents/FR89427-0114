DPR-70 and DPR-75issued to Public Service Electric andamp; Gas Company, Philadelphia ElectricCompany, Delmarve Power and Light Company and Atlantic City Electric Company(the licensees) for operation of the Salem Generating Station, Unit Nos.1 and 2, located in Salem County, New Jersey. The propsed amendments would revise the Action Statements for the ReactorTrip System for Modes 3, 4 and 5 with the reactor trip breakers closedand to explicity address the operable requiremets of the diverse trip featuresas requested in Generic Letter 85-09 in accordance with the licensee'sapplication for amendment dated December 18, 1986. Before issuance of the proposed license amendments, the Commission willhave made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended(the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment requestinvolves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulationsin 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordancewith the proposed amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant incresein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The licensee has evaluated the proposed amendment to determine if a significanthazards consideration exists:<ITAG tagnum="21">A. The probability of occurrence or the consequences of an accidentor malfunction or [of] equipment important to safety previuiosly evaluatedin the safety analysis report will not be significantly increased. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These changes are proposed in order to achieve consistency with Westinghousegeneric design modification to the reactor trip breakers. These modificationsand the associated proposed Technical Specifications increase the reliabilityof the breakers, thereby reducing the probability of malfunction and theconsequences of an accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. The possibility of an accident or malfunction of a different typethan any evaluated previously in the safety analysis report will not becreated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Since the reactor trip breaker modifications and these proposed changeswere initiated to meet staff requirements for improving the breakersm,no new type of accident or malfunction will be created. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. The margin of safety as defined in the basis for any technicalSpecification is not reduced. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change will provide an additional degree of safety inthe event that the reactor trip breakers become INOPERABLE during modes3, 4 or 5 by requiring the trip breakers to be opened. Also, this changeexplicitly addresses both diverse components of the breakers to achieveconsistency with Westinghouse Standard Technical Specifications and theguidance of Generic Letter 85-09. Therefore, it will not reduce the marginof safety for any Technical Specification. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Based on the above evaluation, we have determined that the proposedchange does not involve a significant hazards consideration.</ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's submittal and significant hazardsanalysis and concurs with the licensee's determination that the proposedamendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration. Therefore,the staff proposes to determine that the proposed amendment involves nosignificant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing.Written comments may be addressed to the Regulatory Publications Branch,Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office ofAdministration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216 Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland,from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to interveneis discussed below.By May 30, 1989, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respectto issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating licenseand any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and whowishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a writtenpetition for leave to intervene. Request for a hearing and petitions forleave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rulesof Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If arequest for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by theabove date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designatedby the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretaryor the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a noticeof hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) Thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above.Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party.Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held.If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing heldwould take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment.Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would resultin derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the licenseamendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided thatits final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The final determination will consider all public and Statecommets received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publisha notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance.The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur veryinfrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Att: Docketing and Service Branch, or may be deliveredto the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, by the above date.
