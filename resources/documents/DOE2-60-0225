Working on governmentcontract all available data per 1:50000 mapsheet are systematically gatheredand digitized. The aim is to establish a consistent digital data processingand documentation system able to provide individual information to thepublic. For this purpose an elegant way of data integration supportedby a database management system (DBMS) is necessary. Different geological,geochemical, and geophysical data as well as facts concerning the mineralinventory, mining history, claims and a bibliography shall be incorporatedin the system. Data types and structures are manifold and require specialhandling by the DBMS. Different approaches were tested, like hierarchicalstructured flat file management as for example supported by the VAX/VMSoperating system, index sequential file structures, and relational DBMSlike GRASP. Additionally VAX-DSM an interpreter language, which supportsa highly structured hierarchical storage system is in extensive use.While with this language it is possible to develop a good working systemfor handling alphameric information especially for bibliographic andmineral inventory data, GRASP has reasonable abilities to deal with pointrelated numeric data. The applicability of commercially offered geographicinformation systems is examined. Recent results of the investigationsuggest a combination of different DBMS's, each especially suited tothe respective data structure. Well defined interfaces have to be designedto support convenient transfer and link of data. 5 refs, 2 figs, 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
