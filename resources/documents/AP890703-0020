Less than two weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court said burning theAmerican flag is a legal form of political expression, fulllegislatures in five states have passed resolutions supporting aconstitutional amendment against flag-burning.   Legislative bodies in at least 10 other states have approvedresolutions criticizing the ruling or calling for an amendment toreverse it. And dozens of legislative leaders elsewhere said suchsentiment ran strong in their states.   ``As majority leader, I'll tell you this: If there are two orthree votes against it I would be honestly surprised,'' saidRepublican Rep. Craig Moody of Utah. The legislature there, as inmany other states, is in summer recess.   President Bush on Friday proposed a 20-word constitutionalamendment that would give states the right to prohibit desecrationof the flag. It requires approval by two-thirds of the House andSenate and ratification by 38 states.   In Alaska, ``it would pass within 30 days,'' declared SenatePresident Tim Kelly. ``You're going to have a few liberals whiningin the House, but they'll be overwhelmed by the majority oflegislators and public opinion.''   The last constitutional amendment to gain the required 38 stateswas the one allowing 18-year-olds to vote, in 1971. The Equal RightsAmendment died in 1982 after it got support from just 35 stateswithin the time limit prescribed by Congress.   All states but Alaska and Wyoming have laws banning flag-burning,and lawmakers there have said their lack of such a law was anoversight. The Supreme Court ruling nullified state flag-protectionlaws.   Most legislative leaders contacted by The Associated Press lastweek supported an amendment to overturn the court's ruling. Otherswere troubled by the idea.   ``I am not a bleeding heart,'' said Democratic state Sen. DennyJacobs of Illinois. ``But I don't support meddling with theConstitution.''   ``I don't believe you honor the flag by dishonoring the basicrights contained in the Constitution and Bill of Rights,'' saidDemocratic House Speaker Joe King of Washington state. ``Our currentConstitution has worked well in protecting everything the flagstands for.''   Nontheless, support for a flag-protection amendment spanned partylines and many ideological viewpoints. In California, evenDemocratic Assemblyman Tom Hayden, a prominent anti-war protester inthe 1960s, voted in favor of a resolution urging Congress to approvethe measure.   Calling it ``a close call as an issue,'' Hayden said he believedflag-burning incites violence. Another California assemblyman,Republican Tim Leslie, framed the issue another way: ``What kind ofmessage are we sending to our children when we say it's OK to burnthe flag?''   Legislatures in Colorado, Louisiana, Maine and South Carolinahave approved resolutions calling on Congress to pass aflag-protection amendment. The California Assembly also passed sucha resolution, but it has not gone to a vote in the Senate. The OhioHouse passed a resolution calling for an amendment, while the OhioSenate simply condemned the ruling.   The house or senate in at least 10 other states and a Kentuckylegislative committee have passed resolutions critical of theruling, and sizable groups of lawmakers in Alabama and Arkansascriticized it without any formal vote. The 10 states are Texas,Illinois, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,Delaware, New York, Nevada and North Carolina.   In Texas, the House approved a resolution urging a constitutionalamendment just two days after the high court ruled. But action wasdelayed in the Texas Senate by Democrat Craig Washington, who urgedcolleagues to focus their attention on the values the flagrepresents, not the flag itself.   ``The flag is nothing but a piece of cloth,'' he said.   New Mexico Rep. Blake Curtis, a Republican, saw it differently.``It's a little more than just cloth,'' he said. ``It's a symbol offreedom.''</TEXT></DOC>
