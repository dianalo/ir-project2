The machine, which will be compatible with the IBM-ATpersonal computer standard, is the latest example of theJapanese steel industry's dash to diversify into everythingfrom semiconductors to theme parks.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Three to four years ago, the steel industry was in a verydepressed time,&quot; Kiyofumi Suzuki, general manager of NipponSteel's electronics and information-systems division, said ata news conference Monday. &quot;Our executives decided to get intoelectronics and other areas not related to steel.&quot;   Unlike fledgling computer industry entrants from Taiwanand South Korea, Nippon Steel says it won't make low-priced,imitative knock-offs, but instead wants to cultivate aleading-edge image. &quot;Our target is to be the No. 1 or No. 2brand {in quality} in the U.S. within three or four years,&quot;Mr. Suzuki said. &quot;We will reduce our volume until we can getsupport for consumers and distributors.&quot;   The company said its Librex machine will be the first inits segment with an Intel Corp. 80386sx processor, and thatit is slightly smaller and lighter, weighing about sixpounds, than competing models.   The price, $4,500 for the 386 model and $3,500 for aversion with the slower 80286 Intel processor, is roughly thesame as other notebook-size computers currently on sale inthe U.S.   Nippon Steel says it won't even consider selling in Japanuntil after it has proven itself in the U.S. The Japanesepersonal-computer market is less developed, is dominated bythe relatively proprietary NEC Corp. standard, and &quot;is notopen compared to the U.S.,&quot; even for Japanese newcomers, Mr.Suzuki said. The company will begin exploring the Europeanmarket later this year.   Although it doesn't make any of the major parts, NipponSteel says it engineered the machine itself, drawing on itsyears as a major user of computers and computer systems. &quot;Thesteel companies have acquired their own expertise inelectronics because of processing innovations,&quot; said MinekoSasaki-Smith, head of research at Credit Suisse's Tokyooffice. &quot;In developing their own software,&quot; she added, &quot;theyhave acquired expertise and programs. It was a naturaloutcome.&quot;   In recent years, Nippon Steel has established a jointventure with Concurrent Computer Corp. to make superminicomputers, and signed an agreement to sell SunMicrosystems Inc. workstations in Japan. Two years ago, thecompany set up four software development and servicejoint-ventures.   Nippon Steel executives hope to push the company'sdependence on steel down to 60% of revenues by 1995 from 80%today. They also want to derive one-fifth of their businessfrom the electronics and information-systems group, whichprovides about 5% today.   Nippon Steel isn't alone in its move to diversify. KobeSteel and Kawasaki Steel have semiconductor joint ventureswith American partners. And all the major steel companies areexploring unconventional uses of their excess land, such aspig farming and flower growing. Nippon Steel opened a themepark in southern Japan earlier this year.   Their rationale: Despite a surprising revival in steelsales recently, industry demand is expected to drop about 10%over the next five years, particularly as users seek lighternew materials.   Analysts say it's too early to tell, however, howsuccessful such diversifications will prove, and many expressskepticism. &quot;I think it's pretty unlikely the steel companiesare going to be able to carve a niche in PCs,&quot; said MichaelJeremy of Baring Securites' Tokyo office. &quot;For Japanesecomputer makers it's an extremely competitive area. Whatadvantage do the steel companies have?&quot;   Nippon Steel, however, has fairly ambitious plans. Ithopes to sell 30,000 notebook computers next year and 50,000annually within three to five years. By comparison, NEC,which has more computer experience, expects to sell 20,000notebooks for 1989 and 1990 combined.   Mr. Suzuki said Nippon Steel hasn't finalized anydistribution agreements. The notebook-sized computers will beassembled by Solectron Corp. of San Jose, Calif. LibrexComputer Systems Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of NipponSteel's U.S. unit, is also based in San Jose.   ---                   Japan's Diversification                                                                                                          Non-steel revenue for Japan's five big steelmakers, as apercent of total revenue for fiscal year 1989 ended March 31,and estimate for fiscal years 1995-2000.                                                                                                                                        1989        1995-2000 Nippon Steel                    22.5%          40% NKK                             21.4%          50% Kobe Steel                      31.9%          46.2% Sumitomo Metal                  10%            NA Kawasaki Steel                  18.7%          40%                                                                                                          Source: Credit Suisse</TEXT></DOC>
