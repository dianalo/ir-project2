Nopickup.</NOTE><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Britain and Iran said today they have resumed fulldiplomatic relations, ending a 17-month break in ties caused in partby the arrest of an Iranian envoy on shoplifting charges.   Today's announcement followed talks in Vienna between Sir DavidMyers, Britain's assistant under secretary of state for MiddleEastern affairs, and Dr. Mahmoud Vaezi, director general of Iran'sMinistry of Foreign Affairs.   Iran and Britain ``have decided to resume full diplomaticrepresentation with immediate effect based on reciprocity, mutualrespect and non-interference in each others' affairs,'' said aForeign Office statement.   Tehran Radio said a statement and memorandum of understandingwere signed at Iran's mission in Vienna after a nine-hour sessionthat ended early this morning. Myers traveled to the Austriancapital Wednesday for the third round of negotiations since August.   Mohammad Basti, Iran's lone diplomat in Britain throughout thediplomatic freeze, hinted that the resumption of ties could speedthe release of Britons held hostage by pro-Iranian Islamic militantsin Lebanon.   Questioned on British Broadcasting Corp. radio, Basti said thehostage issue had not arisen in the negotiations, but added: ``Ifyou are trying to imply that the new relationship between Iran andBritain may contribute to that end, I'm not going to deny that.''   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, whose envoy Terry Waitedisappeared in Lebanon in January 1987 while trying to help free thehostages, was also asked whether renewed ties would help thehostages.   ``Certainly this cannot do any harm,'' he said. ``We must waitand see. This is welcome news. After all, the purpose of thisdiplomacy is to make it easy for governments to talk to each other.''   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said the hostages' plight wasnot included in the discussions.   ``There's no bargain or secret agenda,'' he told the BBC, but headded that the thaw enabled Britain ``more effectively to press thecase at every opportunity for the Iranians to use all the influencethey have got to secure the release of hostages.   Diplomatic relations were curtailed in June 1987 after an Iraniandiplomat was arrested on shoplifting charges in Britain andmilitants kidnapped and beat up a British diplomat in Tehran.   Britain withdrew its diplomats from Tehran, closed the Iranianconsulate in Manchester, northern England, and reduced the number ofIranian staff at the London embassy to one.   Since then, British interests in Iran have been looked after bySweden.   A diplomatic source in London, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said the agreement allowed for up to 16 diplomats in eachcountry to assume posts over the next several months.   Howe said Britain would have a charge d'affaires in Iran within afew weeks, and an exchange of ambassadors ``within hopefully sixmonths of that.''   Besides Waite, Britain is seeking the release of journalist JohnMcCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan. The Foreign Office says it alsoseeks word on Alec Collett, a New York-based British journalistwhose Palestinian abductors claim they killed him. His body wasnever found.</TEXT></DOC>
