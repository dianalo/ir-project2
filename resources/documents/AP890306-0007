Bills to ban or restrict military-style assault rifles havesurfaced or are planned for introduction in Congress, 11 states andat least a dozen cities following the Jan. 17 shooting spree at anelementary school in Stockton, Calif.   Five children died, and 29 others and a teacher were injured,when drifter Patrick Purdy opened fire with an AK-47 assault rifleon a crowded playground. He fired 106 bullets in two minutes, andthen killed himself.   The shock and anger that erupted, combined with concerns over themounting use of assault weapons by drug gangs, prompted bans in theCalifornia cities of Stockton, Los Angeles, San Diego, Carson andCompton. Outside California, Cleveland has banned the weapons.   But elsewhere, the outrage seems to be losing some of itspersuasive power.   Bills to ban or restrict assault weapons have died in theMaryland, Indiana and Washington legislatures; in Hutchinson, Kan.;Summit County, Ohio; Los Angeles County, Calif., and New Orleans.   In Hutchinson, city commissioners rejected a ban on assaultrifles after facing an angry crowd of 150, only one of whom spoke infavor of the ban.   The issue has revived familiar gun-control arguments. One sidesays the bloodshed must stop, while the other says Americans have aconstitutional right to own guns.   ``We think America is tired of picking up the newspaper orwatching TV and seeing kids and police officers lying in pools ofblood,'' said Jim Scutt, National Sheriffs Association spokesman.   ``We share the grief of the tragedy in Stockton,'' said NationalRifle Association lobbyist James Baker. ``But the answer does notlie in restricting the rights of law-abiding citizens. The answerlies in getting the criminal off the street.''   The NRA has challenged the California cities' bans in court,arguing that only the Legislature has the power to regulate firearmsin California.   The biggest legislative battles are still to come. Congress isconsidering four bills to ban or restrict assault weapons. Bills arepending or expected to be introduced in California, Florida,Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Oregon and RhodeIsland.   Debate on all the bills focuses on how to define assault rifles.   An automatic weapon, or machine gun, fires bullets as long as thetrigger is pulled. A federal permit is needed to own one.   Semiautomatic rifles, which can be bought over the counter innearly all states, fire one bullet for each pull of the trigger butdo not need to be cocked or loaded between pulls. Most states allowsuch rifles in hunting but usually limit the size of the ammunitionmagazine, or clip.   Distinguishing assault rifles such as the Soviet-designed AK-47from semiautomatic hunting rifles can be difficult.   ``They all function the same way,'' said Tom Hill, spokesman forthe federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. ``All thatchanges is you take off the wood stock and put on a plastic or metalfolding stock, or you put on a banana clip, rather than a smallhunting clip, or you put on a bayonet.''   Some legislation would ban specific brands of guns, but the NRAargues that is useless. ``The AK-47 this year will be the AR-48 nextyear, and they'd be out from under the regulation,'' Baker said.   While the debate bogs down in detail, the issue remains clear toJanet Geng, a Stockton teacher whose leg has a hole ``the size of agrapefruit'' from Purdy's shooting spree.   ``These people against a ban _ I'd like to have had them standingout there next to me,'' she said. ``I don't believe there is anyreason for that type of weapon to exist in our society.''   Hill said imports of AK-47s, which at $250 to $350 are among thecheapest assault rifles, have increased tenfold in the past fouryears. More than 40,000 were imported during the 14 months endingNov. 30, he said.   If anything, Hill said, debate over banning assault rifles hasboosted sales. Demand is reported especially high in California. Andwhen a store in Menomonee Falls, Wis., ran a ``get'em-before-you-can't'' sale on AK-47s, it sold out and had to order150 more.   In Stockton, meanwhile, police are relying on the honesty of gunowners to turn in their now illegal semiautomatic rifles.
