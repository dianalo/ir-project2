However, as compounds become generally safer,the problem of individual variation in response assumes increasing relativeimportance. Environmental factors such as age, health and nutritionalstatus, and interactions with other xenobiotics account for some of thisvariation, but genetic differences between individuals and races haveimportant implications. In a few cases, Mendelian loci which controldrug susceptibility (e.g., to isoniazid) have been described. However,in most cases the exact mode of inheritance has not yet been determineddue to the problems of carrying out genetic studies in man. It is wellestablished that many loci that are polymorphic in man are also so inlaboratory animals, so much of this genetic variation should be pickedup in preclinical screening, and could be used to more accurately predictpotential variation in toxicity in man. Unfortunately, most toxicologistsuse only a single stock of laboratory animals, which does not show whetherthe response to a given xenobiotic is under genetic control. The designof animal tests would be improved by using more than one strain of geneticallydefined animals, and by paying more attention to genetic variation inresponses to xenobiotics, both in animals and man. 97 references.</TEXT></DOC>
