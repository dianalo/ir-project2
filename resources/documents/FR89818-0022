The largest and most vigorous population, in the upperRoanoke River, is subject to the most serious threats: from urbanization,industrial development, water supply and flood control projects, and, inthe upper basin, from agricultural runoff. The other three populationsare subject to siltation resulting from agricultural activities and topotential chemical spills.

It ischaracterized by an elongate, cylindrical to slab-sided body, conical snoutand complete lateral line. The back is dark green, the sides are greenishto yellowish and belly is white to yellowish. The upper sides and backhave dark scrawlings and numerous small saddles. Bar markings on its sidesare prominent, usually separated from the dorsal markings and typicallyovoid in shape.The species commonly lives 5 to 6 years; both sexes probably reach maturityby age four. Spawning occurs in April or May in deep runs over gravel andsmall cobble (Simonson and Neves 1986). <T3>P. rex</T3> feeds primarily on aquatic insect larvae, especially thelarvae of chironomids and caddisflies (Burkhead 1983). During warm months,adults occupy gravel and cobble runs and riffles, while juveniles typicallyutilize slow runs and pools with clean sand substrates. Winter habitatof all individuals appears to be deep pools, under boulders (Burkhead 1983).The Roanoke logperch is endemic to two river systems in Virginia_the RoanokeRiver drainage (including the Pigg and Smith Rivers) and the Notoway Riverdrainage. Its distribution extends from the Ridge and Valley province throughthe Blue Ridge to the lower Piedmont. It now occurs in four disjunct populationslocated in widely separated segments of four rivers: the upper RoanokeRiver, the Pigg River, the Nottoway River and the Smith River. It is probablethat these represent remnants of a single much larger population that onceoccupied much of the Roanoke drainage upstream of the fall line.All extant populations of the Roanoke logperch are in Virginia in the riverreaches described below. Within the upper Roanoke River, the logperch occursin Roanoke and Montgomery Counties from within the city limits of Roanokeupstream into the North and South Forks of the Roanoke. It also occursin Tinker Creek, a tributary of the upper Roanoke in Roanoke County. Inthe Pigg River system the logperch occurs in a 32-mile reach of the mainstemPigg River in Pittsylvania and Franklin Counties, and in Big Chestnut Creek,a Franklin County tributary of the Pigg. In the Nottoway River system thespecies occurs in a 32-mile reach of the mainstem in Sussex County, Virginia,and in Stony Creek, a tributary of the Nottoway in Dinwiddie and SussexCounties. In the Smith River system, <T3>P. rex</T3> occurs in a 2.5-mile reach in Patrick County upstream ofPhilpott Reservoir, and in Town Creek, a Smith River tributary in HenryCounty.Recent survey data (Simonson and Neves 1986) indicate that the largestpopulation of <T3>P. rex </T3>inhabits the Upper Roanoke River. The Pigg River systemis rather sparsely inhabited by the logperch, while the Nottoway Riverhas even lower population densities of the species. The Smith River logperchpopulation appears to be extremely small.Threats to the upper Roanoke population of the logperch are posed by apending Roanoke County water supply project and a proposed U.S. Army Corpsof Engineers (Corps) flood control project. Results of the most recentcomprehensive survey (Simonson and Neves 1986) indicate that the specieshas probably already declined in the North Fork of the Roanoke. Chemicalspills, which have increased in frequency in the industrialized sectionsof the river in Salem and Roanoke, present a continuing threat. The PiggRiver and North Fork of the Roanoke are heavily impacted by silt washedfrom agricultural lands in the watersheds.The Roanoke logperch has been included in three Notices of Review indicatingthat it was a candidate for Federal listing. These were published in May13, 1980, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(45 FR 31447), the December 30, 1982, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(47 FR 58454), and the September 18, 1985, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(50 FR 37958). The last of these Notices placedthe logperch in category 1, indicating that the Service had substantialinformation on hand to support listing the species as endangered or threatened.The Service was petitioned on September 29, 1983, by Mr. Noel Burkheadto list the Roanoke logperch as a threatened species. In 1985, 1986, and1987 evaluations of this petition the Service found that the action waswarranted, but precluded from immediate proposal because of other pendingproposals to list, delist or reclassify species. Notice of these findingswas published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on January 9, 1986 (51 FR 996), June 30, 1987(52 FR 24312), and July 7, 1988 (53 FR 25511), respectively. On September7, 1988, the Service published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 34561) a proposed rule to list the Roanokelogperch as an endangered species.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations</ITAG>In the September 7, 1988, proposed rule and associated notifications, allinterested parties were requested to submit factual reports or informationthat might contribute to the development of a final rule. Appropriate Stateagencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations,and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Newspapernotices were published in the Roanoke Times and World News on September21, 1988, and the Richmond Times Dispatch on September 22, 1988, whichinvited general public comment. No public hearing was requested or held.Fourteen comments were received and are discussed below.Eight letters indicating support for the proposal were received from thefollowing sources: the Forest Supervisor of the Jefferson National Forest,the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, the Virginia NaturalHeritage Program, Dr. R.J. Neves of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute'sDepartment of Fisheries and Wildlife Science, the City of Roanoke, theFriends of the Roanoke River, the Virginia Wildlife Federation, and oneprivate citizen.In his letters of support, the Jefferson National Forest Supervisor indicatedthat the Forest's activities have minimal potential for impacting the logperch,but special consideration would, nonetheless, be given to maintenance ofhigh quality runoff within the headwaters of the Roanoke drainage.The City of Roanoke asked that the Federal Government share in any ``additionalcosts for community projects addressing needs along the Roanoke River andTinker Creek'', that may result from the listing. The Fish and WildlifeService's authority under the Endangered Species Act would limit it toassisting with projects which contribute to the recovery of the logperchor other endangered species.The Friends of the Roanoke River (F.O.R.R.) requested that critical habitatbe designated for the logperch. The F.O.R.R. argues that designation ofcritical habitat is necessary to provide full protection for the logperchand that the benefits of this added protection would outweigh any possiblethreat of vandalism. The Service believes that designation of criticalhabitat would result in no net benefit to the species. The Service's basisfor this conclusion is explained in the critical habitat section of thisrule. The Service notes that, even without critical habitat designation,the habitats of this species will receive protection under section 7 ofthe Act.Letters indicating neither support nor opposition to the proposed listingof the logperch were received from: The Wilmington District of the ArmyCorps of Engineers, and Montgomery and Henry Counties, Virginia. Informationprovided by the Corps of Engineers concerning projects under study is summarizedelsewhere in this rule. Henry County expressed concern over potential effectsof the listing on their water supply withdrawals from the mouth of TownCreek. Based on current information on logperch distribution and the locationof the county's withdrawals, it appears that they will be unaffected bythe listing.Opposition to the proposal was expressed by the Roanoke Valley Home BuildersAssociation, and the County Administrators of Pittsylvania and RoanokeCounties, Virginia. Roanoke County had a number of specific comments onthe proposal which are listed below with the Service's response to each.<T3>Comment 1. </T3>The Corps of Engineers' flood control project and RoanokeCounty's water supply project are no longer threats to the species; thereforeit should not be Federally listed.<T3>Service response. </T3>It is true that both the Corps of Engineersand the County of Roanoke have taken steps to reduce impacts from theirprojects to the Roanoke logperch. The Service agrees that the Upper RoanokeFlood Control Project is not a serious threat to the survival of the logperch.It is, however, a threat to the Roanoke River logperch population withinthe City of Roanoke. It is anticipated that this project may reduce thelogperch population in this segment of the river by up to 25% over severalyears.In comparison with the flood control project, the water supply projectaffects a much longer reach of the Roanoke River containing much of thebest logperch habitat in existence. Thus, it has a much greater potentialfor serious impacts to the species. Corps of Engineers permit conditionsfor this project are designed to ameliorate such impacts, but will noteliminate them. Thus, the water supply project is expected to have someadverse effects on the logperch, even if all permit conditions are conscientiouslyimplemented.The Service cannot agree with Roanoke County that the Roanoke logperchdoes not warrant Federal listing. Even without the existence of these twoproposed projects, the information on population status and other threatsto the species would support its listing.<T3>Comment 2. </T3>The proposal indicates several causes for degradationor modification of habitat, one being urban growth. This can be disputedsince the largest and most dense population noted in Burkhead's study isin the middle of Ronoke City, a highly urbanized area.<T3>Service response. </T3>It is known that pollutants found in urban runoff,including excess nutrients, petroleum products and salt, adversely affectfish. Urban runoff together with effluent discharges and other effectsor urbanization may account for the long river reaches within the Cityof Roanoke from which the logperch is absent. Although there is a densepopulation of logperch at a single location within the City of Roanoke,the continued existence of this population may be dependent on periodicrecruitment of young from upstream populations.<T3>Comment 3. </T3>The proposal also notes that chemical spills have resultedin fish kills; however, no evidence is presented that the logperch hasbeen affected or taken during a fish kill.<T3>Service response. </T3>Burkhead (1983) describes the threat presentedto the logperch by chemical spills. His compilation of records of fishkills in the Roanoke River was based largely on Roanoke Times and WorldNews reports which provided limited information on species killed. However,there is little doubt that logperch were killed during these events alongwith other fish species.<T3>Comment 4. </T3>The proposal indicates that low flows resulting fromthe proposed water supply project would severely degrade the logperch habitat.No proof exists to indicate the proposed project would ``severely'' degradethe logperch habitat. The indications of exposure of riffles, decreasedD.O. levels, increased temperatures during summer and increased pollutionare assumptions that are not substantiated. In fact, the June 1983 EcologicalStudy Report by Noel Burkhead for the Corps of Engineers indicated increasedD.O. levels because of low flow. It also shows that water temperature ismore related to air temperature than flow levels. The exposure of rifflesalso indicates a benefit for increasing D.O. Levels.<T3>Service response. </T3>Burkhead (1986) provides the most specific predictionof adverse effects on the logperch of the low flows resulting from theproposed water supply project. Exposure of riffles and increased watertemperature during summer months are expected to occur in any river whenflows drop to very low levels (Tennant, 1975). Periods of decreased dissolvedoxygen (D.O.) and decreased dilution of pollutants will always accompanythese changes. The increased D.O. in the Roanoke River during the low flowperiod referred to by Burkhead (1983) occurred during an algal bloom. Duringalgal blooms, extreme fluctuations in D.O. are to be expected, with extremelyhigh oxygen levels occurring during sunny periods, and oxygen depressionsoccurring during nighttime or overcast conditions. Such D.O. fluctuationsare generally symptomatic of degraded conditions and are harmful to fishlife.<T3>Comment 5. </T3>Other projects are cited that will reportedly affectthe logperch habitat. However, no economic effects of the listing are presented.<T3>Service response: </T3>Under the Act and its implementing regulations,listing determinations are to be made solely on the basis of the best availablescientific and commercial information regarding a species' status, withoutreference to possible economic or other impacts of such determination.16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(1)(A); 50 CFR 424.11(b).<T3>Comment 6. </T3>One of the most critical problem areas noted in theproposal was silt generated from agricultural activities. This seems tobe the culprit of any reduction or modification of habitat. Without knowingthe intentions of the Fish and Wildlife Service as to the plan to controlthese activities, no one can possibly comment on the effects it may haveon the farming activities along the critical habitat areas.<T3>Service response: </T3>Silt generated by agricultural activities isbut one of many factors affecting the logperch. While the Service may recommendmeasures, such as filter strips along streams, to reduce agricultural runoff,it has no authority to require such modifications of private activitiesunless they result in taking of the species.<T3>Comment 7. </T3>The existing and continued studies performed on thisfish seem to be the only over-utilzation evident. As noted in correspondencefrom Burkhead, over 2,000 collections were made, many of which were specificallyaimed at the capture of the logperch.<T3>Service response:</T3> There is no evidence to suggest that overutilizationhas been a factor in the decline of the logperch.<T3>Comment 8.</T3> The proposal notes that Virginia state law does notprotect the species' habitat from potential impacts. Roanoke County disagreeswith this statement. The State of Virginia does have code sections thatprotect aquatic life, water quality and critical habitat of endangeredspecies and of any outstanding State resource waters.<T3>Service response:</T3> State programs to enforce the Clean Water Actdo provide a degree of protection for all aquatic species. Federal listingwill provide added protection, particularly from those impacts of Federal(or Federally regulated) projects which are not addressed by the CleanWater Act.<T3>Comment 9.</T3> The use of chemical toxicants is prohibited in anyriver in Virginia. State law prohibits any discharge of these materials.Vandalism along with the suggestion of chemical toxicant use stretchesthe point under this heading and should not be considered.<T3>Service response:</T3> All reference to chemical toxicants has beenremoved from the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species''. AlthoughState laws prohibit such discharges, enforcement may be difficult.<T3>Comment 10.</T3> The only significant decline in logperch populationshas been in the reaches where farming activities are prominent, not whereurbanization has occurred or low water levels exist. In fact, low waterlevels seem to be more of an optimum habitat than higher flows. Over 77percent of the river miles occupied by the logperch are in reaches whereflows are only a small portion of the flows that exist in the main streamof the Roanoke River.<T3>Service response:</T3> See response to comments 2 and 6 regarding thethreats presented by siltation and urbanization. Adverse effects of lowflows are described in Burkhead (1986), Tennant (1975) and Camp Dresserand McKee (1986). The absolute flow levels in a river have little meaningin terms of the biology of aquatic species. Instead, fishery biologistsgenerally refer to flows in terms of percentage of natural stream flow(or mean annual flow) when they are evaluating impacts on aquatic species.To date, withdrawals from the Roanoke River have been small enough thatany reduction in natural flows has been minor. Thus no fish declines wouldbe expected to result.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>After a thorough review and consideration of all information available,the Service has determined that the Roanoke logperch should be classifiedas an endangered species. Procedures found at section 4(a)(1) of the EndangeredSpecies Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq</T3>.) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determinedto be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the fivefactors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their applicationto the Roanoke logperch (<T3>Percina rex</T3>) are as follows:A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailmentof its Habitat or RangeThe largest known population of the logperch, in the upper Roanoke River,is under increasing stress from urbanization and industrial development(Jenkins 1979). Urban runoff and other nonpoint-source pollution are increasingproblems. Silt, oil, fertilizer and a variety of chemical pollutants inthis runoff degrade habitat of the logperch. As urban development expandsto the west along the Roanoke River Valley, the river reach degraded bythis runoff will increase. Frequent chemical spills have occurred fromthe industries and transportation corridors along the upper Roanoke River.These have included fuel oil, diesel fuel, sodium cyanide, toluene, gasolineand ethyl benzeyne-creosote (Burkhead 1983). Many of these spills haveresulted in fish kills, several extending over a distance of six milesor more downstream.Additional threats in the upper Roanoke River habitat could result fromthe proposed West Roanoke County Water Supply Project, the Corps of Engineers'Upper Roanoke River Flood Control Project and the National Park Service'sRoanoke River Parkway proposal. The water supply project is intended tosupply projected future water needs of Roanoke County by withdrawal ofwater from the Roanoke River. As projected, it could result in long periodswhen a seven-mile reach of the Roanoke River would be drawn down to lowflow levels. This river reach provides excellent logperch habitat (Burkhead1986) that could be adversely affected by such extended low flows. Predictedeffects of these low flow periods include exposure of riffles, decreaseddissolved oxygen, increased pollution concentrations, and increased watertemperatures during the summer and early fall. Certain recent project modifications,however, lessen the expected severity of these effects.The Corps of Engineers flood control project involves proposed channelmodification of the upper Roanoke River within the city limits of Roanoke.Although the Corps has funded studies of the logperch and worked with theService to reduce project impacts, some adverse effects on the logperchare expected. Several other smaller flood control projects in the Roanokedrainage are under study by the Corps of Engineers. Until these projectshave been defined, it is not known what impacts, if any, they will haveon the logperch.The National Park Service's Roanoke River Parkway could adversely affectthe logperch if it is constructed adjacent to the upper Roanoke River,but until the proposal goes beyond the conceptual stage, the significanceof its impacts, if any, will remain unknown.Most of the rivers supporting the logperch are subject to siltation resultingfrom agricultural activities and other developments in their watersheds.The Pigg River and the North Fork of the Roanoke, in particular, are impactedby silt generated from agriculture. This may partially account for therecently observed decline of the species in the North Fork of the RoanokeRiver (Simonson and Neves 1986).B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreation, Scientific or EducationalPurposesThere is no evidence to suggest that overutilization for any of these purposeshas contributed to the decline of the logperch. Because of the species'low numbers, overcollection could adversely affect its smaller populationsoccurring outside the mainstem Roanoke River.<T3>C. Disease or Predation</T3> There is no evidence that disease is a threat to this species. Predationmay constitute a significant portion of the mortality of the larval andpost larval stages (Burkhead 1983), but this is not considered a significantthreat so long as reproductive rates remain normal.D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory MechanismsVirginia State law (Sections 29.1-412 and 29.1-418) requires a permit forthe scientific collection of freshwater fishes, but does not protect thespecies' habitat from the potential impacts of Federal projects. Federallisting would provide protection for the species under the Endangered SpeciesAct by requiring Federal agencies to consult with the Service when projectsthey fund, authorize or carry out may affect the species.E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued ExistenceThe logperch is vulnerable to vandalism, particularly the small populationsfound at locations other than the mainstem Roanoke River.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list the Roanoke logperch as endangered. Eachof the four relatively small and widely separated populations of the logperchis susceptible to extirpation through continued adverse habitat modification.Several imminent threats are now present in the upper Roanoke River drainage,which supports the species' largest population. Furthermore, the most recentcomprehensive survey for the species (Simonson and Neves 1986) indicatesa sharp decline in the North Fork Roanoke population and low populationdensities for all populations of the fish. Although three other populationsof the species are extant, two of these populations (in the Nottoway Riverand the Smith River) are highly vulnerable to threats because of theirsmall size; the third, in the Pigg River, is threatened by siltation. Inview of the serious problems faced by the logperch, threatened status isnot appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at thetime a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. As outlinedabove under Factors ``B'' and ``E'', the species is vulnerable to overcollectionand vandalism. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat isnot prudent for the Roanoke logperch. No benefit to the species has beenidentified that would outweigh the potential threats of collection or vandalism,which would be exacerbated by publication of a detailed critical habitatdescription. The Corps of Engineers has conducted studies of the upperRoanoke River population of the logperch and is familiar with the species'total distribution. It is the agency that would be involved with most projectsor permits affecting the species' habitat. Several other Federal agencieshave also been notified of the Roanoke logperch's distribution and requestedto provide data on proposed Federal projects that might adversely affectthe species. The involved Federal agencies thus already have the species'distributional data needed to determine if the species may be impactedby their action.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against takingand harm are discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.Revised regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provisionof the Act were published on June 3, 1986 (51 FR 19926). Section 7(a)(2)requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund,or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of alisted species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat.If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat,the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation withthe Service.Federal activities that could impact the Roanoke logperch include, butare not limited to, the following: Issuance of permits for steam alterations,reservoir construction, wastewater facility development, flood controlprojects, and road and bridge construction on the river reaches supportingthe logperch. Three specific proposed actions with Federal involvementthat may affect the logperch are the West Roanoke County Water Supply Project,the Upper Roanoke River Flood Control Project, and the Roanoke River Parkway.These projects and potential impacts on the species are described above.Modifications of these planned activities may be necessary to protect theRoanoke logperch. It has been the experience of the Service that nearlyall section 7 consultations are resolved so that the species is protectedand the project objectives are met.The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth aseries of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangeredwildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subjectto the jurisdiction of the United States to take, import or export, shipin interstate commerce in the course of a commercial activity, or sellor offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any endangered fishor wildlife species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry,transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certainexceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingendangered wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governingpermits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available for scientificpurposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/orfor incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Burkhead, N.M. 1983.
