SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Troops have seized thousands of weapons since acurfew was imposed nearly two weeks ago to quell ethnic violence inUzbekistan, and the death toll rose with the discovery of two morebodies, Tass reported today.   Tass, the official news agency, said troops had confiscated 157firearms and steel weapons as well as 26 firebombs during roadchecks in the last 24 hours. A total of 7,718 weapons have now beenconfiscated.   Meanwhile the remains of two people were discovered and added tothe list of at least 100 victims, Tass said. On Thursday, the agencyquoted Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov as saying that at least 100 peoplehad died during the turmoil that began June 3.   More than 1,000 buildings have been looted and burned since thebrutal rampage against the Meskhi Turk minority began in the FerganaValley about 1,500 miles southeast of Moscow, the agency reported.   At least 1,500 people have been detained for violating the 10p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew that went into effect on June 4, the militarynewspaper Krasnaya Zvezda reported.   Vice President Anatoly Lukyanov has dispatched two deputies ofparliament to prepare a report for the Council of Nationalities,which will investigate the tragedy, Tass said.   The spasm of gang violence in Uzbekistan is a case of ethnichatred being exploited for political gain, Ryzhkov told Uzbek partyactivists at a meeting in Tashkent on Thursday, Tass reportedearlier.   Ryzhkov and former KGB chief Victor Chebrikov, now the Kremlin`stop law-and-order official, wound up a four-day investigation of therampage against the Meskhi Turk minority Thursday, Tass said.   ``This was the work of ruthless and cruel hands of those to whominter-ethnic enmity had always been the soil for the criminalmentality that everything goes,'' Tass quoted Ryzhkov as tellingparty officials. ``Corruption and shady economic and politicaldealings'' played a role, he said.   Ryzhkov said the violence was well-planned and aimed atdestabilizing the republic and the country. He did not identify anygroup or people he held responsible.   At another party meeting Wednesday near Fergana, the city hithardest by the unrest, Ryzhkov said party and government officialsgave gasoline, transportation and vodka to attackers who killedMeskhi Turks.   Uzbek militants have said that unemployment and poor foodsupplies caused anger that was vented in ethnic violence.   The late Soviet dictator Josef Stalin forced the Meskhi Turkminority to leave their homeland in Soviet Georgia in 1944 andresettle in Uzbekistan.   They now number about 300,000, and Ryzhkov said on Tuesday that aspecial commission would consider their request to return to Georgia.</TEXT></DOC>
