Reformers insisted that the ruler no longer usearbitrary power. They wanted wider distribution of power anda presumption in favor of political and economic freedom forthe people. Functionaries of the central power triedintimidation, but the top official eventually lost thesupport of almost every group in society. He was forced togive up what had been nearly absolute power.   The place was Runnymede in England, the year was 1215 andit was King John who was forced to submit to the Magna Cartaand its revolutionary idea of legalized political andeconomic liberty. The king's promises included more power toregional lords, trials by juries of peers, due process and aban on expropriation of private property. This definingmoment for what we now know as &quot;the West&quot; never found an echoin the Duchy of Muscovy, czarist Russia or communist U.S.S.R.</LP><TEXT>   The closest the Soviets ever came to the Magna Carta wasscheduled for last week, when the All-Union Treaty wassupposed to be signed. The treaty was canceled during thecoup that couldn't. The timing of the failed &quot;Putsch&quot; hasbeen linked to provisions in the treaty that would have givenmore power to the republics. It hasn't been widely noted thatthe treaty and implementing laws also threatened the power ofthe Communist Party by introducing counterrevolutionary legalreform.   The treaty would have been the first Soviet charter ofrights for the people, not for the state. The treaty, whichdoes not mention the word socialism, would have created a newUnion of Soviet Sovereign Republics. The republics andcentral government would pledge to &quot;create a rule-of-lawstate which would serve as a guarantor against any tendenciesto totalitarianism and arbitrariness.&quot;   Which raises the question, why a Soviet Union? Since itsfounding, the U.S.S.R. has been defined as a state above thelaw. Lenin, a lawyer before he switched careers, proclaimedthat &quot;A law is a political measure, it is politics.&quot; Marxism,he said, requires the withering away of such bourgeoisconcepts as equal justice under impartial law. Local partybosses have administered &quot;telephone justice&quot; to dictate thecorrect verdict and sentence, prosecutors administeredpsychiatric prisons and judges owed their tenure to partybosses.   Appropriately enough for a country founded onexpropriation, the All-Union Treaty also included a sectionon property rights. &quot;The Union and states forming it ensurefree development and protection of all forms of property,&quot;the treaty said, &quot;and create conditions for the functioningof enterprises and economic organizations.&quot; This is not asprecisely worded as the prohibition against expropriation ineither the Magna Carta or the U.S. Constitution. Still, itwould have been enough, for example, to block the Sovietdecree earlier this year that seized 50- and 100-ruble notes.   The treaty also would have created a new ConstitutionalCourt whose judges would be appointed with the approval ofpopularly elected representatives from the republics. Atleast some of the Soviet judiciary would have beenindependent of the party for the first time.   Recent laws would also clip the powers of prosecutors,known as procurators, who are also traditionally appointedfor their fealty to the party. Jury trials would become morecommon and defense lawyers would get access to their clientsfrom the beginning of a case. &quot;We must have one dictatorshipfor all -- the dictatorship of law and not a dictatorship ofany political group or body of power, Mikhail Gorbachev tolda meeting of Soviet procurators earlier this year. &quot;Aprocurator or judge must be guided by law and law alone.&quot;This was a direct challenge to party apparatchiks.   Indeed, these legal reforms may have posed an even greaterthreat to totalitarian rule than the treaty plan to spreadpower to the republics. It's one thing to lessen the grip ofMoscow, it's another also to strip local party officials oftheir arbitrary power to block licenses, jail &quot;blackmarketeers&quot; or seize property.   By blocking the All-Union Treaty, the hard-line communistsgambled that they could block the double whammy of a rule oflaw that protects private property. Instead, many republicsnow refuse to join any union, confederation or commonwealthfor fear that some other group of communists will again tryto block reforms. It's no wonder many leaders of therepublics and democratic parliamentarians this week asked whythere should be a Soviet Anything.   Now reformers face one of the greatest challenges to theidea of a rule of law. They say they will punish even thecoup plotters with law. &quot;We must all pull away from euphoria,including from the euphoria of victory,&quot; Russian PresidentBoris Yeltsin said on Monday. &quot;And only the law must operate-- no euphoria related to vindictiveness, otherwise we wouldlose our self-respect as democrats.&quot;   Legal punishment for the coup would be extraordinary in acountry that wrote the script for show trials. There are lawsagainst treason, though just who represented the &quot;state&quot; is anice question. It's also not yet clear whether the suicidesof plotters and sympathizers will turn out to be a variant of&quot;coup flu&quot;; the translation from the Russian could makesuicide a transitive verb -- as in Interior Minister BorisPugo was suicided by parties unknown. And of course many ofMr. Yeltsin's post-coup decrees against the party had noapparent legal authority, including his decision to fire thecoup-backing director of Tass and head of the Novosti newsagency.   Still, there is high irony in pleas for legal protectionby party functionaries. One of the final acts of a groupcalled the Ruling Council of the Communist Party ControlCommission was to invoke the rights the party denied everyoneelse for the past 74 years. &quot;We appeal to leaders of stateorgans not to fall for emotions&quot; against the party for thecoup attempt, citing &quot;violations of human rights and people'sprosecutions for political convictions.&quot;   Russia and the other republics will find that there arethose in even the most advanced countries who, given thechance, will abuse the law for political ends. Americanmanufacturers faced with deep-pocket-pickingproduct-liability laws could give tutorials on the dangers ofpoliticized law. So could executive-branch targets ofCongress's &quot;independent counsel&quot; and RICOed defendants.   Still, the coup plotters were entirely right to understandthat introducing modern legal concepts to the Soviet Unionwould be fatal to communism. Assuming that the CommunistParty's over, it will be fascinating to watch the newestadherents to the rule of law join the Western world.</TEXT></DOC>
