These human activities include the combustion of allfossil fuels, deforestation and oxidation of exposed soil. Since theindustrial revolution there has been an increase in the use of fossilfuels and in land use. Reliable data indicate that there has been approx.a 25% increase in CO{sub 2} levels in the atmosphere over the last century.The author gives an overview of the subject and concludes that CO{sub2} emissions to the atmosphere will continue to increase, but at a lesserrate than the escalating contribution from other radiative gases suchas methane, nitrous oxide and various chlorofluorocarbons. Hence in thefuture, the relative influence of CO{sub 2} to the greenhouse effectwill be reduced from its present 50% contribution. The 6% contributionthat CO{sub 2} emissions from the world's coal fired power stations makesto the greenhouse effect is minor and will have little impact on boththe present and future greenhouse effect.</TEXT></DOC>
