GrisdelaStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)ECONOMIC AND MONETARY INDICATORS (EMI)REAL ESTATE, REITS, LAND DEVELOPMENT (REL)CONSTRUCTION, MATERIALS (CON) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The latest government statistics suggest the economy may be entering a period of slower growth, a situation that is likely to be exacerbated by the stock market turbulence of the past few weeks.    A 0.1% September decline in the government's main economic forecasting gauge reflects economic conditions before the stock market plunge. But many government and private analysts expect declining stock prices to pull the figure down for October and possibly for November as well.    The drop in the Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators was the first since a 0.6% decrease in January. It followed a strong 0.6% rise in August and a revised 0.4% gain in July. The July increase had previously been reported as 0.3%.    Separately, the department said sales of single-family homes tumbled 5.2% in September after a revised 2.5% August rise, which was originally put at 2.7%. The decline in home sales probably resulted from higher mortgage interest rates in August and September, analysts said.    The stock market slide is going to reduce consumer spending and slow economic growth next year by forcing people to &quot;go back and realign their savings to meet their financial objectives for the future,&quot; said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University.    However, the drop in consumer spending will be &quot;a slow process,&quot; Mr. Ratajczak said. There won't be a drastic decline in consumer spending that matches the record 508.00-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 19, he predicted.    Consumer reluctance to spend money on big-ticket items, especially houses, will be &quot;the driving force in a slowing economy,&quot; said Warren Lasko, executive vice president at the Mortgage Bankers Association here. &quot;The sense we're getting since the (stock market) crash is that (potential) home buyers are holding back,&quot; particularly in the higher end of the market, he added.    The September decline brought the leading-indicators index to 192.5% of its 1967 average from 192.6% in August.    The department said its index of coincident indicators, which tend to rise and fall with economic activity, rose 0.2% in September to 169.7% of its 1967 average after increasing 0.2% in August to 169.4%.    The index of lagging indicators, which tends to trail economic events, rose 1.2% in September to 142.9% of its 1967 average after dropping 0.1% in August to 141.2%. The department said it recalculated the lagging-indicator index back to January 1982 to incorporate more accurate estimates of one component, unit labor costs.    The ratio of coincident to lagging indicators, which some economists contend signals turning points in the economy ahead of the leading index, declined to 1.19 in September from 1.20 in August, reinforcing some analysts' concerns about slackening economic growth ahead.    Commerce Department officials say they estimate stock prices will make October's leading index about 1% lower than it might otherwise be, and private analysts generally agree. Some economists noted that one component of the index, the average manufacturing work-week, was artificially depressed in September by a late Labor Day and is likely to have bounced back to make a positive contribution to the October index.    Even so, many analysts expect the leading index to decline in October and possibly also in November as a result of stock price declines as well as weakened orders for consumer goods and slower housing activity.    Three consecutive monthly declines in the leading index is a signal to some analysts that the economy is heading for a downturn. Few economists say they're expecting a recession, but most agree that some sectors of the economy are likely to soften.    &quot;We're not forecasting a recession, but we think there will be fewer housing starts and fewer construction jobs&quot; next year, said Mr. Lasko of the Mortgage Bankers Association.    One bright spot in the outlook for housing is that the recent rally in the bond market has brought mortgage interest rates down from the highs reached in September. That means there is potential for &quot;reasonably good&quot; housing activity for the remainder of this year, said James Christian, chief economist at the U.S. League of Savings Institutions. Mr. Christian predicted that home sales could still reach 690,000 for 1987, although other economists are less optimistic.    The September decline brought home sales to an annual rate of 656,000 units following a 2.5% increase in August to a 692,000-unit rate. The September pace was 11.8% below September 1986.    According to the report, there was a 6.8-month supply of unsold houses at the end of September, up from 6.4 months in August.    The department said the average price of a new house rose 7.9% to $139,800 in September from $129,600 in August. The median price increased 8.5% to $115,600 from $106,500.    By region, home sales in the Northeast rose 9.2% in September after falling 0.8% in August. In the Midwest, sales fell 10.8% after declining 12.6% in August, and in the South they dropped 3.9% following a 5.6% decrease. In the West, home sales declined 13.2% in September after a 7.3% increase the month before.    The figures in both reports are adjusted for seasonal changes. Before seasonal adjustment, an estimated 52,000 new houses were actually sold in September, down from 58,000 in August.    Here are the net contributions of the components of the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators. After various adjustments, they produced a 0.1% decline in the index for September and a 0.6% increase in the index for August.                                             Sept.
