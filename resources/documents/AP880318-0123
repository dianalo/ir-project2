Asked whether the Thursday bombing raid indicated that theUnited States had asked Honduras to take a more active role, WhiteHouse spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We haven't asked them orinstructed them to do anything. We have offered our support and wehave sent our forces there in defense of that.''   A Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry spokesman in Managua blamed theUnited States for the attack, formally protested and warned suchraids could lead to war.   In Congress, lawmakers were condemning Nicaraguan PresidentDaniel Ortega as they became convinced he had ordered a militaryincursion into neighboring Honduras, an action that renewed callsfor U.S. aid to the anti-Sandinista rebels.   ``There's a feeling that Mr. Ortega is pretty damn stupid,indeed,'' said Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., a member of the HouseIntelligence Committee who was briefed Thursday on the borderincursion against the Contra rebels.   ``This so-called final offensive against the Contras may havemade sense militarily, but it was bad politics,'' said Sen.Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.   Briefings for members of Congress by top Reagan administrationofficials portrayed the Sandinista military action as along-planned and skillfully executed attack that was threatening aContra command center a few miles northwest of Bocay, Nicaragua,just inside the Honduran border.   Several moderate Democratic House members, who were behind afailed March 3 attempt to provide strictly ``humanitarian'' aid tothe rebels, said the move gave new impetus to the effort to pass anaid package.   But while there was unanimity that the Managua government hadmade a grave political miscalculation, opinions were mixed on thewisdom of President Reagan's decision to deploy a 3,200-man taskforce to Palmerola Air Base in Honduras.   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci reiterated today that thetroops were there only for ``moral support'' and that they would bekept away from combat during their 10-day training exercise.   Of the border clash, Carlucci said information remained sketchybecause of the remoteness of the area. He said fighting hadresulted in casualties, but he did not know how many.   Interviewed on ABC television, Carlucci was asked whether therehad been any significant victories or defeats in the fighting.``No, I wouldn't characterize it in those terms, although thefreedom fighters have had to fall back a bit,'' he said. ``They'vehad to abandon some of their positions and move to otherpositions.''   Pell, D-R.I., said the move to deploy U.S. troops tended toreduce Honduras to the status of a U.S. client state and ``may wellbe a greater threat to Honduran sovereignty'' than the borderincursion.   And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Reagan's response haddistracted attention from the Sandinista military thrust and costthe president some political leverage.   A senior Republican on Pell's committee, Sen. Richard Lugar,disagreed. He said the troop deployment ``indicates we are stillalert'' to the situation in Central America.   Lugar predicted that the request for military support ``will notbe the last from Central American democracies.''   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,said the deployment was ``obviously designed to impress theSandinistas. I hope they get the message.''   There was conflict, too, on how the developments would affectcease-fire talks scheduled to resume Monday in the Nicaraguan townof Sapoa near the Costa Rican border.   House Speaker Jim Wright said he had high hopes, after talkingto both sides, that the discussions would lead to a cease-fire.Lugar, however, said the talks ``have become more and more anacademic exercise.''   In a series of briefings on Capitol Hill, senior administrationofficials and intelligence officers said the United States firstdetected preparations for the Sandinista incursion late last month,primarily by observing troop and supply buildups at a base innorthern Nicaragua.   Roughly a week ago, movements were observed toward Bocay, aNicaraguan town in a remote and mountainous area on the Honduranborder. It is unclear exactly when the troops first crossed theCoco River into Honduras, but Contra forces defending a rebelcommand center northwest of Bocay began to encounter governmenttroops early this week, according to interviews with more than adozen participants in the briefings.   With greater-than-usual precision, some 2,000 Sandinista troopshad by Thursday taken positions to the north, east and south of theContras' jungle command and supply post, which was being defendedby about 1,300 rebel troops, the administration said.   Lawmakers were promised that the U.S. troops, sent from the 82ndAirborne at Fort Bragg, N.C., and the 7th Infantry at Fort Ord,Calif., would remain far from the fighting and would not beinvolved in combat.   The administation said sending the forces was a symbolic gestureof support for Honduran President Jose Azcona, in response to adirect request from him Wednesday night after several days ofconsultations.   ``Had we said no, you can imagine what it would have done forour credibility in Central America,'' said Assistant Secretary ofState Elliott Abrams.   Some in Congress questioned the administration's credibilityanyway, noting that Azcona's written request for help was datedTuesday, and the administration had been telling lawmakers that nosuch request had been made as recently as Wednesday afternoon.   Asked today about the complaints, Fitzwater said, ``They weretold exactly what happened, that options were being considered andno decision had been made.''   `We feel the consultations were thorough and appropriate,'' hesaid. ``A lot of this is just politics, and nothing can be doneabout that. Our people felt they were fully responsive.''   Abrams said the administration is considering a request for newaid for the rebels. On Feb. 3, Reagan narrowly lost a House vote onhis last such request, and a Democratic alternative was defeated,216 to 208, a month later. A handful of votes tilted one way or theother typically determines the outcome on the longstanding andpolarized issue.</TEXT></DOC>
