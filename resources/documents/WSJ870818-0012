The tests would be the first U.S.-approved human clinical trial of a vaccine against AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. News of the forthcoming test, first published in the Washington Drug Letter, a weekly trade publication, subsequently was confirmed by a federal health official. Executives of the closely held company, which has about 30 employees, were said to be on a retreat and unavailable for comment.    The MicroGeneSys vaccine reportedly uses a gene-spliced version of the outer coat of the AIDS virus. The protein coat, known as gp 160, would be used to &quot;trick&quot; the body into mounting an immune defense against the real virus, should exposure occur later on. MicroGeneSys makes the vaccine in a culture of insect cells engineered to manufacture the proteins in quantity, sources said.    MicroGeneSys is one of many companies currently working on developing an AIDS vaccine. Two of these groups -- the Oncogen division of Bristol-Myers Co., and Houston-based Institute of Immunological Disorders in concert with George Washington University -- have applied for FDA approval to begin tests, an agency spokesman said. Other companies working on AIDS vaccines include Genentech Inc., Chiron Inc. in collaboration with Ciba-Geigy Corp., Repligen Corp. with Merck andamp; Co., and Cambridge Bioscience Corp. with Institut Merieux of France.    The forthcoming tests are expected to be announced today in Washington by the company and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or Niaid, a unit of the National Insitutes of Health. Niaid has a network of six university-based vaccine evaluation units that include Vanderbilt University, Baylor College of Medicine, the University of Rochester, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Maryland and Marshall University in Huntington, W.Va.    These test sites have evaluated vaccines for everything from pertussis (whooping cough) to flu over the years. But recently the health institute added a supplement to their contract, specifically enabling them to study AIDS vaccines, a spokeswoman for Niaid said. That move sparked a flurry of rumors last week that tests were imminent.    Once tests begin, however, there's no guarantee of success in preventing the fatal immune disorder that has so far struck some 40,000 Americans and killed more than half of them. Indeed, early tests on animals by several groups have been disappointing. Given to chimpanzees, some early vaccine preparations sparked the production of antibodies, but failed later to prevent infection when the animals were exposed to the virus.    Another difficulty is anticipated in selecting the group to be tested, since many people at risk for AIDS already have been exposed to the virus.    Earlier this year, French scientist Daniel Zagury disclosed that he had performed human tests, injecting himself and other French and African volunteers with an experimental AIDS vaccine. </TEXT></DOC>
