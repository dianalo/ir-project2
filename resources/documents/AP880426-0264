BERGSTROM</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Domestic auto sales rose slightly duringmid-April, although among the biggest automakers only ChryslerCorp. recorded car sales gains in the period.   Sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks totaled 353,314 fromApril 11-20, up from 308,240 a year earlier, a 1.9 percent gain indaily sales, domestic automakers reported Monday.   There were eight sales days in the period this year and ninedays in the period last year. The percentage changes compareaverage daily sales, not straight totals.   The daily sales rate for light trucks rose 3.2 percent, whilecar sales rose 1.2 percent.   Chrysler Corp. posted a 21.4 percent increase in car sales froma soft performance in the year earlier period. Car sales declined4.4 percent at General Motors Corp. and 2.6 percent at Ford MotorCo. from strong mid-April 1987 periods.   GM car sales totaled 112,344 in mid-April, compared with Ford's65,626 and Chrysler's 33,842.   ``I think that April is going to be a month in which you aregoing to see auto sales go back to some sort of sustainable rate,''said Jeanette Garretty, an industry analyst with Bank of America inSan Francisco.   She said the easing sales were not surprising after automakers'incentives kept sales brisker than expected for most of the firstquarter.   Ray Windecker, an analyst at Ford, said sales incentives hadpushed industry sales to a 7.6 million seasonally adjusted annualrate in April 1987, a year that ended up averaging a 7.1 millionrate. This year's mid-April sales were at a 7.5 million seasonallyadjusted annual rate.   ``These are good substantial sales, against very strong saleslast year,'' Windecker said. ``It's differences in timing ofincentives more than anything else.''   Among foreign manufacturers making cars in U.S. plants, AmericanHonda, which moved more production to the United States, sold10,738 of its U.S.-made cars in the period, up from 6,488 a yearearlier.   Nissan USA's sales of 2,950 U.S.-made cars represented a 19.3percent drop in daily sales; Toyota sold 1,396, a 17.7 percentincrease; and Volkswagen sold 1,375, a 4.7 percent increase.   Sales of imported cars and trucks are reported at the end ofeach month.</TEXT></DOC>
