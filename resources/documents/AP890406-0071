Stephen Higgins, director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco andFirearms, said that proposal, among others, is being studied bygovernment agencies as the administration weighs additional stepsto control the deadly weapons.   ``I've been asked to give comments on that and a lot of otherproposals that were made,'' Higgins, said Wednesday. ``Theadministration is involved in looking at the entire issue, gettinginput from a lot of people, of which this agency is one.''   Another administration official, who spoke on the condition ofanonymity, said today that putting semiautomatic rifles in the samecategory as machine guns _ requiring an FBI background check and awaiting period _ is ``one of the options'' actively beingconsidered.   The official also said that some steps to crack down on thesales of high-powered, rapid-fire weapons could be announced by theadministration within the next few weeks.   An initial plan, dealing just with the District of Columbia, wasto be unveilled on Monday by federal drug coordinator William J.Bennett. The official said this package would deal more with suchissues as finding more prison space and expanded use of federalprosecutors than with the guns themselves, since the districtalready has tough gun-control laws on the books.   Higgins made his comments as he discussed the administration'smove to widen its temporary import ban on assault rifles to includevirtually all foreign-made models.   Earlier Wednesday, the White House had announced that 24 modelsof semiautomatic assault rifles were being added to the list ofweapons already covered by the 90-day ban on imports imposed lastmonth.   The initial import suspension covered as many as 400,000weapons. The additional list covers permits to import up to 250,000more, Higgins said.   ``We think we've got 99.9 percent'' of the foreign-madesemiautomatic rifles, Higgins said.   The 90-day period for banning imports of semiautomatic weaponswill enable ATF to determine if any of the weapons on the list areused for legitimate sporting purposes. The Gun Control Act of 1968bans the importation of weapons that are not used for legitimatesporting purposes.   ``These are weapons which are identical in design'' to those onthe original list, Higgins said. ``They are basically paramilitaryin appearance, they are large-capacity magazines.''   Importers have been given 30 days to ``substantiate that theweapons they are selling are being used for sporting purposes,'' hesaid.   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saida prime reason for expanding the ban was to prevent a few gunmanufacturers from gaining an unfair competitive edge.   But he conceded that ``there is some unfairness'' because theban still does not affect American-made high-powered rifles, whichaccount for 75 percent to 80 percent of the market.   ``Unfortunately, it is not something we can do anything about,''Fitzwater said. ``To do anything about domestically manufacturedweapons would require a change in the law.''   Fitzwater declined to say whether Bush would eventually proposea change in the law to include the American-made weapons.   But Higgins said a proposal to require registration ofsemiautomatic assault-style rifles is under study.   He said President Bush has asked him to comment on imposing aregistration requirement on semiautomatic rifles that would be akinto the current rules governing machine guns and other militaryweapons.   CBS News reported Wednesday night that Bennett, whom Bush hadasked to recommend what should be done about the weapons, told Busha week ago that ``Rambo-looking rifles with a large clip'' shouldbe treated the same as the machine guns.   Larry Cirignano, a Bennett spokesman, said the network reportwas ``not an accurate depiction'' of Bennett's views, but hedeclined to elaborate. ``We never talk about what we recommend tothe president,'' he said.   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, last week proposed a $200registration fee and a requirement that purchasers of the weaponsbe fingerprinted and submit to a background check.   Metzenbaum's proposal was among a number of issues discussedlast week by Bush and top federal law enforcement officials at aWhite House meeting.   The ATF director declined to describe the administration'sdeliberations on the proposal. ``But that system is beingconsidered by a lot of different people,'' he said.   The administration first suspended imports of assault rifles onMarch 14, amid mounting furor over the use of such guns by drugdealers and other criminals, notably the slaying of five childrenin a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard in January.   The next day, Colt Industries Inc suspended sales of its popularAR-15 rifle, an American-made weapon similar to assault-stylerifles covered by the import ban.   Bush, a member of the National Rifle Association, has slowlybeen moving away from the NRA's hard-line advocacy of the right tobear arms of any type.   While Bush initially opposed any outlawing of guns, the latestmove marks another advance in the administration's tougher stanceon assault weapons.   The president's latest action drew sharp criticism from a groupof conservative Republican lawmakers who met with White House Chiefof Staff John Sununu to register their objections.   ``Most of us felt the action today solves no problems.Administratively, it's a nightmare. Practically, it solvesnothing,'' said Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho.   Widening the ban was ``a confirmation of the fact that he (Bush)is parting company'' with gun-control opponents, said Craig.</TEXT></DOC>
