VAX 11/780 or 8300.andM;To share the bureau's expertise with miners, officials began four years agoto develop expert systems documenting the knowledge of a half-dozen Bureau ofMines officials.andM;The six expert systems, called the Pro Series, will help mining companiesdesign their own ways to control methane gas and dust that causes black lungdisease.andM;The Bureau of Mines' nine research centers across the country eventually willtake over much of the bureau's administrative processing on new PrimeComputer Inc. 9755 minicomputers, installed last year.andP;  The minis runscientific and analytical applications, as well as an electronic-mail systemconnecting all centers over an X.25 network.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
