(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two murder cases, one of them 20 yearsold, have been closed with the conviction of a man policeconsidered a suspect from the beginning and whose arrest wassparked by a national television program.   To the women who knew him, Robert Weeks was a Clark Gablelookalike. But authorities say he was a man whose jealous rages ledto the deaths of two women and most likely a third.   Weeks was convicted Friday in the 1968 murder of his ex-wife andthe 1980 murder of a former girlfriend. The jury recommended thathe spend the rest of his life in prison without the possibility ofparole.   ``I believe Bob Weeks is finally history,'' said deputy districtattorney Mel Harmon.   Authorities had considered him the prime suspect in the killingof his ex-wife, Patricia Weeks, right from the beginning. He alsowas convicted in the killing of Cynthia Jabour, and police believehe also killed a San Diego woman, Carol Ann Riley.   All three women vanished after agreeing to meet Weeks fordinner. All three had told him just before they disappeared thatthey were ending their relationship with him.   Ironically, it was Weeks' latest girlfriend, a Tucson, Ariz.,free-lance writer, who turned him in last year after seeing thetelevision program ``Unsolved Mysteries'' and recognizing Weeks asthe man suspected of killing the women.   None of the bodies was ever found, forcing prosecutors to puttogether a painstaking case of circumstantial evidence.   ``Generally in a murder case you've got a body and you put on amedical examiner and he explains the cause of death,'' said Harmon.``We didn't have a body so we couldn't do that.''   Instead, Harmon put on members of the victims' families, formerneighbors, doctors, anyone he could find with a connection to thevictims and Weeks. In all, 52 witnesses were called during a3-week-long trial.   Many of the witnesses remembered Weeks as very much a ladies'man, with a pencil-thin mustache and dark hair that made himresemble Clark Gable.   ``We had to put on a whole lot of people so we could make itcrystal clear that these disappearances couldn't be voluntary,''said Harmon.   Relatives testified that Mrs. Weeks would never have voluntarilyleft her four young children.   A friend testified of seeing Mrs. Weeks for the last time whenshe got a threatening phone call from Weeks 15 days after theirdivorce. The friend said he confronted Weeks after the woman'sdisappearance and that Weeks matter-of-factly replied, ``She eitherhad a nervous breakdown or is probably dead.''   A doctor testified about treating Mrs. Weeks several times forbruises that she suffered at Weeks' hands.   A friend of Miss Jabour testified that the real estate brokerwould never have gone off without her valued clothes or a $47,000securities account.   And the father of Miss Riley recalled his daughter telling himshe owed Weeks one last dinner, at which she was going to tell himof her engagement to a Colorado doctor.   ``The real challenging part of the case was Patricia Weeks,''said Harmon. ``We had to go back years with family members who havedone their best to block out the memory. And the other people justdidn't care that much about it.''   Harmon has a theory about the fate of the victims.   ``This fellow had a lot of interest in mining, he knew wheremineshafts were,'' the prosecutor said. ``If we knew where thesemineshafts were I think we'd find the remains of Patricia Weeks andCynthia Jabour.''</TEXT></DOC>
