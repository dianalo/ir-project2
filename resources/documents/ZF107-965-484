Comten 3690 front-endprocessors are used to run DLANET at DLA supply centers, depots, servicecenters and defense contract administration service regions, said WilbertBailey, DLANET project manager.andM;Bailey said the other military services have not expressed interest increating the same type of links between their supply networks and DLANET.andO;But once officials see the NLN-DLANET connection is running smoothly andprofitably on both sides, &quot;I'm sure they will be interested,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
