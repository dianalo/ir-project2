Epperson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> ASH </CO><IN> PET </IN><G> JUS </G><TEXT>   A federal jury in Ashland, Ky., awarded two former Ashland Oil Inc. executives nearly $70 million after finding that the company and its top executives had wrongfully discharged them for protesting alleged illegal foreign payments.    Ashland officials, shocked by the size of the award, immediately said they would appeal the decision. &quot;We're still convinced that the evidence doesn't justify the verdict,&quot; said Dan Lacy, a vice president of the Ashland-based oil refining, marketing and chemical company.    The awards to Bill E. McKay Jr., former corporate vice president, and Harry D. Williams, former vice president and lobbyist, represented amounts trebled under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Mr. McKay was awarded $43.3 million in lost and future earnings and $1,250,000 in punitive damages, while Mr. Williams won $23.2 million in lost and future earnings and about $1,750,000 in punitive damages. In addition, the jury ordered Ashland Oil to pay the plaintiffs' legal fees for the eight-week trial.    In their four-year-old civil suit against Ashland, the former executives had claimed the company fired them in 1983 after they blew the whistle about payments Ashland made to Mideast oil middlemen to obtain crude oil after the 1979 Arab oil embargo.    Mr. McKay alleged that former Ashland Chairman Orin Atkins undertook several ventures with a Libyan-born businessman who had ties to the sultan of Oman and who said he could help the company obtain Omani oil.    The foreign bribes issue has dogged Ashland before. The Securities and Exchange Commission in July 1986 charged Ashland and Mr. Atkins with making $28.7 million in illegal payments to an Omani official to obtain crude oil. The company and Mr. Atkins immediately settled the SEC lawsuit without admitting or denying they had bribed the Omani official.    In the SEC matter, Ashland and Mr. Atkins consented to injunctions barring them from violating the anti-bribery provisions of the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.    Mr. Atkins resigned from Ashland in 1981. Neither he nor attorneys representing him could be reached for comment yesterday.    In the trial ended Friday, Ashland attorneys argued the foreign payments weren't illegal. They also maintained that the allegations had been investigated &quot;exhaustively&quot; by many government agencies. &quot;Neither the company nor any individual has ever been charged with any violation of law or determined to have violated a law,&quot; the company maintained.    Ashland officials said the jury's decision shouldn't affect profit this year. &quot;Depending on how the appeal goes, we may not have to pay anything,&quot; said Mr. Lacy.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Ashland shares closed unchanged at $70.50.    In addition to asking for dismissal of the jury's decision, Ashland is expected in its appeal to urge reducing the damage amount and throwing out use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute. The appeal process could take years.    Mr. McKay's attorney, John McCall, hailed the jury's decision. &quot;Ashland Oil had a senior executive who had the courage to stand up for obedience to the law, and the American judicial system has supported that stand,&quot; he said.    In Washington, an elated Mr. Williams said the verdict vindicated his whistleblowing activities. &quot;The jury indicated they believed what I had been saying about Ashland for years,&quot; he said. &quot;It certainly reaffirms my credibility and reaffirms that what I did was right and was for the benefit of the company.&quot;    Mr. Williams has been in professional limbo since his 1983 dismissal, trying sporadically to practice law while pursuing his lawsuit against Ashland. &quot;I don't have any money in my pocket yet, but it's a good start,&quot; said Mr. Williams, who was represented by Kenneth Robinson, a Washington trial lawyer.    In addition to Ashland and Mr. Atkins, the defendants included John Hall, the company's chairman and chief executive officer; Robert McCowan, vice chairman, and Richard Spears, vice president. The jury ruled that all but Mr. McCowan have to pay some kind of damages to the two plaintiffs. </TEXT></DOC>
