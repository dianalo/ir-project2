Southland already has purchased two-thirds of its stock, using borrowed money.    Because of volatile securities markets, Southland's plan to go private appears to be in jeopardy. Touche, the eighth largest U.S. accounting firm, played an important role in the proposed buy-out financing by providing Southland's lenders with a little-known service known as a solvency letter.    In leveraged buy-outs, companies go private using borrowed funds to buy out public shareholders. The debt is designed to be paid by future cash flow or sale of assets. Solvency letters have been quietly requested in increasing numbers in the past two years by lenders who want to be assured that the buy-out can be completed and that the debt incurred by companies going private through buy-outs won't push the companies into insolvency.    Richard Murray, executive director of Touche Ross International and Touche's former general counsel, declined comment on the Southland transaction. But he acknowledged that the writing of solvency letters by accounting firms generally &quot;is risky because it deals with future events that can change very quickly in the current stock market environment.&quot; He added, &quot;That's why we do any solvency letter with extreme care.&quot;    Five banks, led by Citibank, asked Southland's investment bankers, Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc., earlier this year to obtain a solvency letter from Touche. The accounting firm was asked to attest that Southland could pay back the banks and other creditors.    On the basis of a solvency letter from Touche and Valuation Research Corp., a Milwaukee consulting firm that does asset valuation, the banks lent $2.1 billion to Southland, investment bankers said. Citicorp Industrial Credit Credit Inc., a Citicorp unit, is the lead banker. The other banks are Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., Bankers Trust Co., Security Pacific National Bank and and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. A spokesman for Citicorp declined comment on the Southland transaction.    Without such a letter, the banks told Southland they wouldn't extend the loans, the investment bankers added.    If Southland were unable to pay some debts to the banks or other creditors because the buy-out is in limbo or for other reasons, the banks or these creditors could accuse Touche of negligent practice in giving them assurance that the transaction could be completed, say attorneys familiar with such transactions.    According to these attorneys, the banks also wanted these letters to protect themselves from possible litigation down the road from other unsecured debtors of Southland. The attorneys say that even if the buy-out is completed but the company later collapsed under the burden of new debt, the unsecured creditors of Southland, such as suppliers and vendors, could accuse the banks of &quot;fraudulently conveying&quot; Southland's assets to themselves.    Solvency letters were almost unheard of several years ago, but a recent spate of leveraged buy-outs, mergers and corporate restructurings has spurred lenders to ask accounting firms and other appraisers of corporate assets for them.    Dan Goldwasser, an attorney and consultant to the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants, said the solvency letter is a &quot;dangerous extension of the liability exposure of all accounting firms.&quot; He added, &quot;With all the liability problems that accounting firms have had over the past seven years, the solvency letter could put one more nail in the malpractice coffin that the profession may be fashioning for itself.&quot;    Since 1980, major accounting firms have paid close to $300 million in out-of-court settlements to disgruntled shareholders, suppliers and lenders of companies that encountered severe business problems soon after their financial statements were given audits certifying their financial health.    Partners of major accounting firms privately acknowledge that providing solvency letters to companies in leveraged buy-outs, mergers and other corporate restructurings is extremely risky. But they note that if they don't provide such letters, clients would find new auditors who would.    Recognizing the increased risk of providing such letters, accounting firms are asking consultants who do asset valuations to also sign the letters.    Robert Simpson, managing director of Valuation Research's New York office, which shared the Southland evaluation, acknowledges that providing solvency letters for buy-outs and other corporate restructurings is &quot;a tricky business.&quot; Asked whether Valuation Research has any liability exposure because of the letter to Southland's lender, Mr. Simpson said, &quot;We did the letter for a fee and did the best we could. I'd rather not try to guess where this Southland deal will turn out.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
