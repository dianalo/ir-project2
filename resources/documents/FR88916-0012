Prior regulations requiredState child support enforcement (IV-D) agencies to perform certain medicalsupport enforcement activities. This regulation requires State IV-D agenciesto extend these activities to certain IV-D cases not embraced by the priorregulations and eliminates a restriction which applies to cooperative agreementsbetween State IV-D and State Medicaid agencies. The IV-D agency is requiredto develop criteria to identify existing child support cases which havea high potential for obtaining medical support, and to petition the courtor administrative authority to modify support orders to include medicalsupport for targeted cases even if no other modification is anticipated.In addition, the IV-D agency is required to provide the custodial parentwith information pertaining to the health insurance coverage obtained bythe absent parent for the dependent child(ren). Further, this regulationdeletes the condition that IV-D agencies may only secure health insurancecoverage under a cooperative agreement when it will not reduce the absentparent's ability to pay child support. Finally, this regulation deletesprior maintenance of effort requirements States must adhere to when enteringinto a cooperative agreement with the State Medicaid agency. No changeswere made to the regulations as a result of comments received. These activities will expand the number of children for whom private healthinsurance coverage is obtained by increasing the availability of thirdparty resources to pay for medical care and will result in Medicaid costsavings to State and Federal governments. Federal funding under title IV-Dof the Social Security Act is available to State IV-D agencies for theserequired medical support activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>September 16, 1988, except for andSection;andSection;306.51 (b)(3) and (b)(5) which are pending OMB approval.

Hagan, Policy Branch,OCSE (202) 252-5368.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>Section 16 of the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L.98-378) amends section 452 of the Social Security Act (the Act). This statuterequires the Secretary of HHS to issue regulations to require that StateIV-D agencies petition for the inclusion of medical support as part ofany child support order whenever health care coverage is available to theabsent parent at reasonable cost. It also provides for improved informationexchange between State IV-D and State Medicaid agencies. OCSE publishedimplementing regulations on October 16, 1985 in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(50 FR 41887). Those regulations require theState IV-D agency to secure medical support information regarding the absentparent, to exchange information with the State Medicaid agency, to petitionthe court or administrative entity to include health insurance in new ormodified support orders, whether or not it is currently available to theabsent parent at reasonable cost, and to take steps to enforce orderedhealth insurance coverage. The State IV-D agency may perform certain functionsbeyond the scope of the title IV-D program, including providing serviceson behalf of individuals who are not receiving IV-D services, by enteringinto cooperative agreements with the State Medicaid agency pursuant to45 CFR Part 306, Subpart A. In prior years, little attention was paid to petitions for health insurancecoverage for the dependent child of an absent parent with the result thatonly a limited number of AFDC cases already adjudicated require the absentparent to obtain health insurance coverage. Prior requirements to petitionfor medical support were applicable only to new cases or cases which requiredmodification of existing orders for reasons other than medical support.After those regulations were published, it became apparent that healthinsurance coverage for a substantial number of existing child support caseswas not addressed. This regulation expands the prior requirement to include existing caseswith child support orders which warrant modification solely for purposesof obtaining medical support. Examples of situations in which petitionsto modify might be considered are: (1) Absent parents leaving unemploymentcompensation rolls due to changes in employment status, in which case thenew employers will, most likely, provide health benefits; (2) Absent parentshaving wages withheld for child support, in which case it is likely theyshould have jobs that provide health benefits; (3) Other indications thatthe absent parents are employed by organizations likely to provide healthbenefits such as union membership, available wage information from Statetax forms, etc.; or (4) Situations in which comparisons with Medicaid dataindicate that health benefits formerly provided without a court order havelapsed. The prudent use of State and Federal resources dictates that theIV-D Agency develop procedures to work closely with the State MedicaidAgency to give priority to cases in which there is a demonstrated needfor medical support. Enhancements to medical support enforcement activities have been made becauseof the belief that many absent parents have private health insurance orhealth insurance coverage available through employers, unions or othergroups. Such coverage may be extended when available at reasonable costto provide for dependents' medical expenses. This regulation will benefitfamilies by increasing the incidence of absent parents who obtain healthinsurance coverage for their dependent children and will result in costsavings to State and Federal governments by reducing Medicaid expenditureswhen such insurance is available to families who are eligible for AFDCor Medicaid services. This regulation is also responsive to the February12, 1985 findings of the General Accounting Office's report to Congress,``Improved Efforts Needed to Relieve Medicaid from Paying for ServicesCovered by Private Insurers,'' which stressed that the Medicaid programshould be relieved of health care costs if some other person is legallyresponsible to pay since Federal and State Medicaid costs (which, accordingto the report, totalled $38 billion in 1984) would be reduced without affectingMedicaid services. This regulation is also responsive to the Office of the Inspector General'sstudy entitled ``Child Support Enforcement/Absent Parent Medical Liability''which looked at cases in which a new or modified child support order wasestablished in the first quarter after the effective date of the earliermedical support regulation. Medical support was included in the child supportorder in less than half of these cases. These final regulations addressthe concerns of the Office of Inspector General about the availabilityof medical support services and the better coordination between the responsibleagencies.The implementing regulations of October 16, 1985 also included interimfinal regulations, with a comment period, for andSection;andSection; 305.20(c)and 305.56, which added medical support enforcement to the State plan-relatedaudit criteria. The audit regulations were effective October 16, 1985,with a comment period until December 16, 1985 for any public comment. Sinceno comments were received by the December 16 deadline, no revisions arenecessary to the interim final regulations and those regulations are finalrules.<ITAG tagnum="84">Statutory Authority</ITAG>This regulation is published under the authority of sections 1102, 452(f)and 454(13) of the Act. Section 1102 authorizes the Secretary of HHS topublish regulations not inconsistent with the Act which may be necessaryto efficiently administer the Secretary's functions under the Act. We believethis regulation is consistent with the Act, as section 462(b), which defines``child support'' for purposes of certain garnishment proceedings to include``payments to provide for health care'', has long been an integral sectionof title IV-D of the Act. In addition, section 452(f) of the Act requiresthe Secretary of HHS to issue regulations to require States to petitionfor the inclusion of medical support as part of any child support orderwhenever health care coverage is available to the absent parent at a reasonablecost. Further, under section 454(13) of the Act, States must comply withsuch requirements and standards as the Secretary of HHS determines to benecessary for the establishment of an effective title IV-D program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Provisions</ITAG>Prior regulations at 45 CFR 306.10(g) provided that IV-D agencies may,under cooperative agreement, secure health insurance coverage through courtor administrative order when it will not reduce the absent parent's abilityto pay child support. This regulation deletes the condition that the healthinsurance may not affect the absent parent's ability to pay cash supportpayments.This regulation deletes the maintenance of effort requirement at 45 CFR306.40 which prohibits a decrease in title IV-D program activities, personneland resources as a result of entering into cooperative agreements witha State Medicaid agency.Section 306.51(a) of prior regulations stated that, for purposes of thissection, health insurance is considered reasonable in cost if it is employment-relatedor other group health insurance. This regulation amends 45 CFR 306.51(a)by designating all that follows the phrase ``For purposes of this section''as paragraph (1) and clarifying in the newly designated paragraph (1) thatall employment-related or group health insurance is considered reasonableregardless of the service delivery mechanism. A new paragraph (2) clarifiesthe definition of health insurance to include health maintenance organization(HMO) and preferred provider organization (PPO) and other types of coverageunder which medical services could be provided to the dependent child(ren)of an absent parent.Prior regulations at 45 CFR 306.51(b) required State IV-D agencies to petitionthe court or administrative authority to include health insurance in newor modified court or administrative orders. As previously stated, therewas no specific requirement for State IV-D agencies to return to courtto add medical support to existing orders. This regulation amends 45 CFR306.51(b) by redesignating the current contents of paragraphs (b) (3),(4), (5) and (6) as (b) (6), (7), (8) and (9), respectively, and insertingnew paragraphs (3), (4) and (5).The new paragraph (b)(3) requires all State IV-D agencies to develop writtencriteria to identify cases not included under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)with a high potential for obtaining medical support based on: (i) Evidencethat health insurance may be available to the absent parent at a reasonablecost; and (ii) Facts, as defined by State law, regulation, procedure orother directive, which are sufficient to warrant modification of the existingsupport order to include health insurance coverage for a dependent child(ren).The new paragraph (b)(4) requires State IV-D agencies to petition the courtor administrative authority to modify support orders for targeted casesidentified in paragraph (b)(3) to include medical support in the form ofhealth insurance coverage.The new paragraph (b)(5) requires IV-D agencies to provide the custodialparent with health insurance policy information when the absent parentsecures coverage for the dependent child(ren). This includes any informationavailable to the IV-D agency about the health insurance policy which wouldpermit a claim to be filed or, in the case of HMO's and PPO's, servicesto be provided.This regulation does not alter or replace other provisions at 45 CFR 306.51.It remains the responsibility of the State IV-D agency to take steps toenforce health insurance coverage as required by court or administrativeorder. The IV-D agency is not responsible for enforcing medical supportof an unspecified nature, unless this is done under cooperative agreementwith the State Medicaid agency.As indicated above, Federal funding is available to IV-D agencies for theserequired medical support activities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Response to Comments</ITAG>We received 32 comments in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemakingpublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on May 27, 1987 (52 FR 19738). Twenty-five Stateagencies, four local agencies, two private citizens and one advocacy groupsubmitted comments.Section 306.10(g) Securing Health Insurance CoverageWe received eight comments including six from State agencies on revisingandSection; 306.10(g) to allow IV-D agencies under a cooperative agreementwith the Medicaid agency to secure health insurance coverage through courtor administrative order regardless of whether or not it will reduce theabsent parent's ability to pay child support.<T3>Comment:</T3> All eight commenters expressed concern that, if medicalsupport were to be treated on an equal footing with financial support,the potential adverse impact on child support collections would outweighthe benefit to the child and the State Medicaid agencies. Commenters expressedconcern that payment or recovery of medical expenses can be delayed whilechild support payments meet the daily needs of the child(ren) and thatthis change may force medically needy families onto welfare if there isa reduction in cash support.<T3>Response:</T3> Under current IV-D regulations (andSection; 306.51(b))which require State IV-D agencies to petition for inclusion of medicalsupport in support orders, there are no provisions which allow the petitionfor medical support to be excluded because it might adversely affect financialsupport. The revision to andSection; 306.10(g) makes IV-D requirements undercooperative agreements consistent with the general responsibility of IV-Dagencies for seeking establishment of medical support.Section 306.40 Maintenance of EffortWe received five comments from State agencies concerning the deletion ofthe maintenance of effort requirement when a IV-D agency enters into acooperative agreement with the State Medicaid agency.<T3>Comment:</T3> All five expressed concern that enforcement of financialsupport could suffer without the maintenance of effort requirement.<T3>Response:</T3> The regulations were revised to provide States moreflexibility in developing cooperative agreements which are best suitedto the needs of the State and the agencies involved. This change conformsto the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA's) regulations implementingsection 2367 of Pub. L. 98-369, which provides the States greater flexibilityin the administration of the third-party liability program. In addition,the maintenance of effort requirement is no longer necessary to ensurethat child support services are provided as a result of the revised auditcriteria published October 1, 1985 in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (50 FR 40120). The audit regulations requiredOCSE to conduct an audit of State IV-D agencies at least once every threeyears to determine whether each State has an effective IV-D program. Theseregulations incorporate objective performance criteria which OCSE willuse to determine program effectiveness in providing child support servicesto those in need of them.Section 306.51(a) Securing and Enforcing Medical Support ObligationsWe received eight comments on the clarification that service delivery mechanismdoes not affect whether health insurance is considered reasonable.1. <T3>Comment:</T3> Four commenters, including two State agencies, askedhow the medical support regulations will be enforced when the absent parent'shealth insurance coverage is through an HMO which may not be geographicallyavailable to the child(ren).<T3>Response:</T3> The regulations only require the IV-D agency to petitionthe court or administrative body which establishes support orders to includemedical support in the support order in appropriate cases. The provisionsof a support order are determined on a case-by-case basis in accordancewith State law and judicial or administrative discretion. If the IV-D agencypetitions the court or administrative authority to include medical supportin the order and the court or other authority does not do so, the IV-Dagency has met its responsibility under the regulations.Furthermore, it should be noted that availability of insurance alone maynot be a sufficient indicator that it would be cost-effective for the IV-Dagency to seek modification of an order if the available insurance hasgeographic limitations which preclude the child(ren)'s use of the services.2. <T3>Comment:</T3> One State agency requested we revise the language ofthe regulations by adding ``all alternative service delivery systems''so as to include individual practice associations (IPA's), dental professionalorganizations (DPO's), group and model HMO's and other forms of servicedelivery.<T3>Response:</T3> We are revising the language of the regulations in responseto the commenter's request to clarify that fee-for-service, HMO and PPOwere cited only as examples of service delivery mechanisms. Additionalservice mechanisms such as those in the commenter's letter are also included.3. <T3>Comment:</T3> One local agency requested further definition of ``reasonablein cost.''<T3>Response:</T3> We consider any employment-related or other group coverage``reasonable'' under the assumption that most employment-related or othergroup health insurance is inexpensive to the employee/absent parent. Astudy done in 1983 by the National Center for Health Services Researchof the Public Health Service indicated that, for low-wage employees withemployer-provided insurance coverage, 72% of the premium costs was paidfor by the employer. These regulations do not require that absent parentsbe asked to purchase more expensive individual health coverage for theirchildren.4. <T3>Comment:</T3> One local agency expressed concern that the custodialparent could refuse to use a health care provider required by the absentparent's health care coverage.<T3>Response: </T3>It is beyond the scope of these Federal regulationsto specify that the custodial parent must use the health care providerscovered under the absent parent's health insurance policy. These regulationspertain to IV-D agencies' responsibilities, not those of Medicaid recipientsunder title XIX of the Act. In non-AFDC cases, since the IV-D agency mayprovide medical support services only with the consent of the non-AFDCindividual, refusal to use the health care provider should not be a problem.5. <T3>Comment: </T3>One State agency opposed the definition of health insuranceas reasonable if it is employment-related or other group health insurance,since in minimum wage jobs the insurance often is not reasonable in cost.<T3>Response: </T3>As cited earlier, research indicates that 73 percentof low-income employees can obtain employment-related insurance at reasonableor no cost. Ultimately it will be up to the court or administrative authorityto decide in an individual case whether the health insurance is availableat a reasonable cost.6. <T3>Comment: </T3>One State agency questioned whether the statement insection 306.51(a)(1) that ``Health insurance is considered reasonable incost if it is employment-related or other group health insurance'' meansthat any employment implies that health insurance is available at reasonablecost or that the determination of reasonable is to be based on employmentwhere health insurance is known to be offered by the employer or availableunder a group plan.<T3>Response: </T3>Section 306.51(b) requires the State to petition thecourt or administrative authority to include health insurance in new ormodified court or administrative orders for support whether or not healthinsurance at reasonable cost is actually available to the absent parentat the time the order is entered. We believe that this will result in fewerdelays in obtaining coverage for dependents because the State will notalways have to go back to the court or use administrative procedures tohave medical support included in the existing order once insurance becomesavailable to the absent parent. If, however, the IV-D agency is seekingto modify an order solely for medical support, there must be evidence thathealth insurance may be available to the absent parent at a reasonablecost and facts must exist which are sufficient under State law to warrantmodification of the existing support order.Section 306.51(b)(3) Establishment of Written Criteria Where There is aHigh Potential for Obtaining Medical SupportWe received 13 comments on the new provision that the IV-D agency shallestablish written criteria to identify existing cases where there is ahigh potential for obtaining medical support.1. <T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters requested greater specification of thephrase ``high potential for obtaining medical support'' to avoid beingheld accountable as a result of an audit or review for not adequately implementingthe medical support requirements.<T3>Response: </T3>As explained in the rationale accompanying the proposedregulations, States are being given the flexibility to set their own criteriafor selecting cases with high potential for obtaining medical support toreturn to court. This will allow States to respond to conditions and requirementsof State law which may be unique to them. We encourage State IV-D agenciesto consult with the State Medicaid agencies for assistance in determiningwhich type of cases have the greatest potential for high future costs savings.When attempting to determine the availability of health insurance coverageunder andSection; 306.51(b)(3)(i), States could focus on cases with incomethat is indicative of regular employment, such as cases with orders forwage withholding and cases with assets which may be indicative of changedfinancial circumstances or substantial income. Similarly, States couldexamine the employment history of absent parents to identify union membership,new employment or other situations which may indicate the existence ofhealth insurance resources. However, it should be noted that availabilityof insurance alone may not be a sufficient indicator that the case is appropriatefor modification under State law or that the available insurance wouldbe beneficial to the child, e.g., coverage may exclude certain pre-existingconditions, or have geographic limitations such as a PPO which would precludethe child's use of the services.2. <T3>Comment: </T3>Four commenters opposed the requirement that cases bereviewed to identify cases with high potential for medical support coverage.One State agency commented that the process could be duplicative if theMedicaid agency already knows of health insurance coverage. Another Stateagency suggested that the process of identifying absent parents with healthinsurance resources is an on-going labor-intensive process with a minimalsuccess rate. The commenter indicated that questionnaires to the absentparent requesting information about insurance coverage generate less thana 50 percent response and additional investigation with the absent parent'semployer or insurance carrier often doesn't improve the information gathered.<T3>Response: </T3>In too many cases, children are not receiving appropriatechild support services, including medical support coverage, because theircases are lying moribund, with no periodic review to determine whetherthe child(ren)'s needs have changed or the absent parent's circumstanceshave varied. The review of cases based on State-developed criteria willalleviate this injustice. States have been given the opportunity to developcriteria and procedures to fit their special needs, while ensuring medicalsupport services will be provided to those in need. State IV-D agenciesshould collaborate with the State Medicaid agency and with employers andinsurance carriers to identify cost-effectively those cases with a highpotential for medical support.3. <T3>Comment: </T3>Three State agencies and one local agency expressed theconcern that full implementation of the medical support provisions wouldrequire IV-D agencies to perform additional duties, resulting in a diversionof resources from the establishment and enforcement of child support obligations,and would increase the workload of the courts and the Medicaid agency.One commenter suggested that the requirement be limited to cases referredto the IV-D agency by the Medicaid agency.<T3>Response: </T3>OCSE realizes that the implementation of the medicalsupport requirements, both the earlier (October 16, 1985) regulations andthese more expansive revisions, will necessitate additional resources.Federal financial participation in these additional costs is available.We also believe that it is in a State's best financial interest to aggressivelypursue medical support since such efforts could result in considerableMedicaid cost savings to the State.The suggestion that the requirement apply only to cases referred by theMedicaid agency is inconsistent with the purposes of the IV-D program.Services provided under the IV-D program must be available to all who requestand need them. We recommend collaboration with the Medicaid agency in developingthe criteria so that Medicaid-eligible cases will be served, but the IV-Dagency must also provide services to children needing medical support whoare not eligible for Medicaid.4. <T3>Comment: </T3>One State agency pointed out that neither the IV-D agencynor the Medicaid agency may know the medical history of the child(ren)and that the Medicaid agency would learn of large medical bills only afterthey are incurred.<T3>Response: </T3>To be able to establish and enforce medical supportobligations in situations of extraordinary medical expenses or chronicconditions, States should be aware of the child(ren)'s medical history.Although IV-D agencies are not specifically required to investigate thechild(ren)'s medical history, certainly, any information which comes totheir attention concerning new medical exigencies should be considered.5. <T3>Comment: </T3>One State agency requested clarification regarding whetherin interstate cases the criteria of the initiating State or of the respondingState govern if there is a difference in criteria the States use to determinecases with a high potential for obtaining medical support.<T3>Response: </T3>Where there is a difference between the criteria ofthe initiating State (the State where the child(ren) and custodial parentlive) and the responding State (the State where the absent parent lives)the criteria of the responding State will govern because it is the respondingState's criteria which will govern whether or not the case meets the conditionsfor modification in that State. An initiating State may request a reviewof an existing interstate case to determine if modification to includemedical support in the order should be sought. In responding to such acase, however, the responding State will use its own criteria for selection.6. <T3>Comment: </T3>One State agency expressed concern that the effect ofthe medical support regulations would be that the IV-D agency would beworking many of the child support cases twice (presumably once to establishchild support and again to seek medical support) with the potential ofissues other than child or medical support (presumably custody or visitationissues) being raised during an attempt to modify the order. The commenterindicated that Federal funding is not available for adjudicating theseissues.<T3>Response: </T3>In attempting to modify an order to address medicalsupport, other unrelated issues may be raised. States should encouragethe participation of custodial parents in modification hearings. If non-IV-Dissues are raised, custodial parents should definitely be given an opportunityto obtain private counsel to protect their interests. The commenter iscorrect that Federal funding is available only for IV-D activities thatare part of the approved State plan.7. <T3>Comment: </T3>One State agency expressed concern that the regulationwould allow financial support and medical support to compete in all levelsof the child support system. One local agency pointed out that some States'child support guidelines take into account medical support in the formof medical insurance premium payments when establishing financial supportamounts while other States' guidelines do not and requested guidance fromOCSE on how to include medical insurance premium payments in financialsupport guidelines.<T3>Response: </T3>Medical support is an integral part of child supportand should not be considered as an extraneous issue. In developing thewritten criteria to identify the high priority cases for referral to thecourt or administrative authority for inclusion of medical support, Statesshould consider whether adequate financial support to obtain medical supportis already included in the original order.In September, 1987, OCSE published ``Development of Guidelines for ChildSupport Orders: Advisory Panel Recommendations and Final Report,'' whichwas prepared under a grant to the National Center for State Courts. Copiesare available from the OCSE Reference Center, Room 2525, 330 C Street,SW., Washington, DC 20201. This publication may be useful to States indetermining how to address medical support in support guidelines. However,each State was required to have implemented by October 1, 1987, guidelinesusing the criteria that the individual State considered appropriate.Section 306.51(b)(3)(i) Evidence That Health Insurance May Be Availableto the Absent Parent at a Reasonable CostWe received four comments on the requirement that the written criteriafor identifying cases with high potential for obtaining medical supportinclude evidence that health insurance may be available to the absent parentat a reasonable cost.<T3>Comment: </T3>The commenters all expressed concern that obtaining medicalsupport would be hindered by restrictions on coverage by insurance companies,including the exclusion of dependents not living with the policyholder,born out-of-wedlock, or born before enrollment but not listed at the timeof enrollment; geographic restrictions; and policy riders which void coverageif Medicaid benefits are available.<T3>Response: </T3>OCSE is fully aware that there are certain restrictionsimposed by some insurance companies which will hinder obtaining medicalsupport. However, these should affect only a small proportion of cases.The IV-D agency should notify the Medicaid agency in cases where insurancecompany restrictions are inconsistent with section 1903(o) of the SocialSecurity Act, which states that Medicaid is to be the payor of last resort.The IV-D agency should also work with the Medicaid agency and the StateInsurance Commission to have unduly harsh health insurance policy restrictionsinvestigated.Section 306.51(b)(3)(ii)_Facts, as Defined by State Law, Sufficient toWarrant Modification to Include Medical SupportWe received three comments on the requirement that the written criteriafor identifying cases with high potential for obtaining medical supportinclude facts, as defined by State law, which are sufficient to warrantmodification to include medical support.1. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that ``law'' should be replacedwith ``law, regulation, procedure or directive.''<T3>Response: </T3>While we believe circumstances which warrant modificationof support orders are generally set forth in State law, some States mayaddress those circumstances in regulations, judicial procedures or courtdirectives. The point of this section is to ensure that criteria for identifyingcases in which to seek medical support should take into consideration thecircumstances under which it is allowable in the State to seek to modifya support order. Accordingly, we have accepted the commenter's suggestionand have revised andSection; 306.51(b)(3)(ii) to include regulation, procedureor other directive.2. <T3>Comment: </T3>One court officer pointed out that several States havelaws that allow modification of child support orders only upon the showingof a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the partiessince the entry of the original order. The commenter requested clarificationabout the apparent conflict between the statement in the proposed rulethat this ``proposal would expand the audience of the current requirementto include existing cases with child support orders which require modificationonly for the purposes of medical support'' and the actual language of andSection;306.51(b)(3)(ii) which requires States to establish criteria for identifyingcases with a high potential for obtaining medical support based on factswhich are sufficient to warrant modification of the existing order.<T3>Response: </T3>As stated in the rationale accompanying the proposedregulation, not all cases where an absent parent has available health insurancewould be appropriate for return to court. Support orders are generallymodified only in response to a significant change in the circumstancesof the parties since the rendering of the original order. Likely candidatesfor modification actions may include cases which indicate a change in themedical needs of the child or changes in the financial circumstances ofeither parent. Attention should be given to cases where medical supportwould be of obvious benefit to the family. This includes cases where thechild's health is affected by chronic or debilitating illnesses which requireextensive, expensive health services. States need to examine their ownlaws to determine what restrictions apply in the State with respect toseeking modification of an existing order to include health insurance.3. <T3>Comment: </T3>One State agency commented that each State has differentstatutory standards for a modification of child support orders, and citedthe difficult standard in its State.<T3>Response: </T3>OCSE is cognizant of the diversity among the Stateswith respect to when a modification can be sought. For that reason, theregulations allow States to develop criteria for identifying cases whichwarrant modification to include medical support under the State's law.If the State's law governing modification is restrictive, the number ofcases in which the State will be able to seek modification to include medicalsupport will be similarly restricted.Section 306.51(b)(4)_Petition the Court or Administrative Authority toModify Orders to Include Medical Support in the Form of Health InsuranceCoverageWe received 24 comments on the requirement that the IV-D agency petitionthe court or administrative authority to modify orders to include medicalsupport in the form of health insurance coverage for cases identified asappropriate according to the criteria in andSection; 306.51(b)(3).1. <T3>Comment: </T3>The majority of commenters expressed concern that thetime, effort and staff required to examine existing cases and to petitionthe court or administrative authority for medical support in cases identifiedas appropriate should not be diverted from child support efforts.<T3>Response: </T3>Prior regulations only mandated efforts to obtain medicalsupport in new orders or orders modified for reasons other than just seekingmedical support. Under that requirement, the need for medical support inexisting cases was ignored. This regulation addresses that inequity byrequiring States to identify those existing cases in which medical supportmight be available and there are grounds for modification solely to obtainsuch support. In so doing, it eliminates inequitable treatment under theprogram and ensures scrutiny to detect the availability of health insurance.OCSE believes that the benefits of obtaining medical support in existingcases should outweigh the administrative burden of examining the currentcaseload and petitioning the court or administrative authority. The gatheringof information to assist the decisionmaker, including a description ofthe available health insurance coverage, the medical history and specialmedical needs of the child(ren), and any change in the financial circumstancesof either party, could lead to increased support awards, in addition tomedical support for the child(ren) and Medicaid cost savings for the Stateand Federal government. In any case, Federal matching funds are availablefor any additional administrative costs associated with these activitiesand the expected Medicaid cost savings should far outstrip any cost ofadditional resources.2. <T3>Comment: </T3>One State agency pointed out that State law prohibitsthe County Attorney from petitioning the court to modify a child supportorder, including any ancillary matters, and that this provision would requirea State law amendment.<T3>Response: </T3>Section 306.51(b)(4) requires IV-D agencies to petitionthe court or administrative authority to modify support orders for casesthat meet the criteria established by the State under andSection; 306.51(b)(3).In order to meet this requirement, States will have to develop procedures,enact laws, or make whatever changes are necessary to allow them to securemodifications in accordance with andSection; 306.51(b)(4).3. <T3>Comment: </T3>One State agency expressed concern that it would haveto amend its administrative process law in order to modify orders to includemedical support administratively.<T3>Response: </T3>Use of administrative process can expedite establishmentand enforcement of support. If legislation is needed to allow administrativemodification of orders to include medical support, we urge the State topursue a legislative change.4. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters stated that some courts would not considera revision of child support orders to include medical support to be a significantenough change in the circumstances of the parties to be defensible in thecourt. One commenter also expressed concern that the court might reducethe financial support obligation if the case were to be returned to court.<T3>Response: </T3>The IV-D agency is only required to petition the courtor administrative authority for medical support if it believes the circumstanceswould warrant a modification in accordance with State law and procedures.The court or other authority must decide whether the need for medical supportis sufficient to revise the child support order. However, if the IV-D agencyadequately prepares its requests for modification, explaining the child(ren)'sneeds and that the absent parent has available health insurance coverageat a reasonable cost, the court or administrative authority could wellgrant the requested modification. The possibility of a decrease in thefinancial support obligation at the same time is a factor the State shouldconsider in determining which cases warrant petitions for modification.The child(ren)'s medical needs may, in some cases, be so important thatthe health insurance coverage is essential and warrants any risk of reductionin financial support. We believe that in most cases where there has beena substantial change in circumstances, the hearing for consideration ofmedical support could also result in an increase in the amount of financialsupport.5. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that many child support orders areobtained by consent and that absent parents' failure to consent to a revisionto include medical support in the child support order could increase theburden on the already back-logged court system. Nine commenters expressedconcern over the increased workload on the courts due to child supportrevisions being requested to include medical support. <T3>Response: </T3>We encourage IV-D agencies to attempt to modify a childsupport order to include medical support by consent order. However, shouldsuch attempts fail, petitions for modification will have to be filed. Statecriteria for selecting cases ``ripe'' for modification should enable theuse of expedited processes to establish most modified orders and, therefore,only complex cases should be referred to the full judicial process. Thecourts should not be unduly burdened because we believe that most modificationswill be routine and cases will be handled under expedited processes. 6. <T3>Comment: </T3>One State agency suggested that it is beyond the requiredfunctions of the IV-D agency to address the medical history of the child(ren)in petitioning for medical support. <T3>Response: </T3>OCSE does not envision an examination of the child(ren)'smedical history in all cases. Rather, such an examination would only beneeded when the medical history and special medical needs come to the attentionof the IV-D agency and are integral to the argument for inclusion of medicalsupport in the child support order. 7. <T3>Comment: </T3>One State agency strongly objected to the provision whichrequires that revisions to child support orders be sought solely for thepurpose of including medical support. The State agency suggested that thesame result would be achieved eventually as cases were reviewed and petitionedfor revision of financial support. <T3>Response: </T3>OCSE agrees with the commenter that these regulationswould not be necessary if all child support awards were routinely reviewedand updated since the State must petition for inclusion of medical supportin all new and modified cases. The State may not have to establish a separatereview process for medical support, if it routinely reviews all cases forpotential modification of support and there are provisions in its reviewcriteria which allow cases to be modified for medical support even in theabsence of a potential revision in the support award. 8. <T3>Comment: </T3>One State agency worried that petitioning the court oradministrative authority to include medical support in child support orderscould result in countersuits that will involve property distribution, custodyor visitation issues. <T3>Response: </T3>Although there is potential for additional, extraneousissues to be raised when the court or administrative authority is petitionedfor inclusion of medical support in the child support orders, researchindicates that there is a much greater chance for the child(ren)'s situationto be improved (e.g., inclusion of medical support, an increase in theamount of financial support) by petitioning the court or administrativeauthority. 9. <T3>Comment: </T3>One advocacy group commented that, since their Statelaw provides that the amount the absent parent pays for the child(ren)'smedical insurance be deducted from his or her income before calculatingthe financial support obligation, if the custodial parent can provide medicalinsurance for the child(ren), the proposed requirement would unnecessarilyreduce the amount of financial support. <T3>Response: </T3>Section 306.51(b)(1) requires the IV-D agency to petitionfor medical support ``unless the custodial parent and child(ren) have satisfactoryhealth insurance other than Medicaid.'' If the custodial parent does nothave access to health insurance, the family may be better off with medicalsupport, even if the result is less financial support. 10. <T3>Comment: </T3>One local agency commented that the custodial parentwho is an AFDC recipient might not wish to pursue medical support sincehealth services are provided by the Medicaid program while the non-AFDCcustodial parent would not welcome medical support, unless the child(ren)have major medical problems, if health insurance payments might impacton the absent parent's ability to pay financial support. <T3>Response: </T3>In accordance with section 1912 of the Act, Medicaidrecipients must assign any rights to medical support to the Medicaid agencyand cooperate in securing that support as a condition of eligibility forMedicaid. Non-AFDC custodial parents, who are not Medicaid applicants orrecipients, must consent before receipt of medical support enforcementservices, in accordance with andSection;306.51(c). Since custodial parentsotherwise would have to secure health care coverage when they leave theAFDC roles, inclusion in the absent parent's group plan could be considerablycheaper. Section 306.51(b)(5) Provide the Custodial Parent With the Health InsurancePolicy Information We received 13 comments on the requirement that the custodial parent beprovided information pertaining to the health insurance policy which hadbeen secured for the dependent child(ren) under this section. 1. <T3>Comment: </T3>The majority expressed concern that the mechanism forobtaining this information has not been established and that meeting thisrequirement would be difficult and expensive. <T3>Response: </T3>Section 306.51(b)(5) requires IV-D agencies to providethe custodial parent with health insurance policy information when theabsent parent secures coverage for the dependent children. This would includeonly any information which is available to the IV-D agency. 2. <T3>Comment: </T3>Four State agencies asked whether the IV-D agency wouldbe required to interpret the provisions of the policy or to assist thecustodial parent with the filing of claims. <T3>Response: </T3>The IV-D agency is required to provide the custodialparent with health insurance policy information when the absent parentsecures coverage for the dependent child(ren), including information availableto the IV-D agency about the policy which will permit a claim to be filedand what services are to be covered, or provided in the case of HMO's andPPO's. The IV-D agency is not required to interpret the policy or assistin the filing of claims. 3. <T3>Comment: </T3>One State agency suggested that the States should begiven flexibility to designate which agency should be responsible for notifyingthe custodial parent of available health insurance coverage. <T3>Response: </T3>The IV-D agency need only ensure that the custodialparent gets the information about the health insurance policy. If the IV-Dagency prefers to arrange for the custodial parent to receive the informationfrom some other source via a cooperative agreement or other procedure,it may do so, as long as the custodial parent receives the necessary information.4. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters, including a State agency, suggested thatwe specify what information the IV-D agency must provide to the custodialparent. <T3>Response: </T3>The IV-D agency must provide any information availableto it about the health insurance policy which would permit a claim to befiled or, in the case of HMO's or PPO's, services to be provided. 5. <T3>Comment: </T3>One State agency asked if implementation could be delayedfor a year to allow States to assess the fiscal impact. <T3>Response: </T3>OCSE believes that adequate time has elapsed since theenactment of the 1984 Amendments for the States to have fully preparedfor their implementation. Further delay would only result in children beingdeprived of the medical support which is their due. Comments Received on Potential Financial Impact of Requirements 1. <T3>Comment: </T3>Sixteen commenters pointed out that their child supportenforcement programs are audited and evaluated on the basis of the ratioof child support collections to expenditures and that inclusion of expendituresfor medical support enforcement without providing appropriate credit forcollection of health insurance premiums or savings to the Medicaid programwould lower that ratio. Some commenters recommended that expenditures associatedwith medical support activities be deducted from the IV-D agency's totalchild support enforcement expenditures when performance ratios are computed.<T3>Response: </T3>The method of calculating incentive payments is specifiedin title IV-D of the Act. However, we believe that the overall impact ofthe requirements in this regulation on incentive payments to States willbe nominal. 2. <T3>Comment: </T3>Fourteen commenters requested that an incentive systemfor medical support enforcement activities be established. Some commentersspecified that OCSE should permit the State to count the health insurancecoverage premiums as collections eligible for incentive payments. <T3>Response: </T3>Current statute does not allow health insurance premiumsto be counted as collections eligible for incentive payments. However,since the savings accruing to State governments as a result of medicalsupport efforts may be substantial, States may wish to examine the possibilityof rewarding their IV-D agencies for aggressive medical support effortswith some portion of the non-Federal share of resultant savings. Statescould develop incentive formulas to reward their State or local IV-D agenciesfor successful medical support enforcement activities based on Medicaidsavings. 3. <T3>Comment: </T3>Four commenters expressed concern that OCSE had underestimatedthe impact of the regulations. One State agency suggested that OCSE shoulddo an extensive impact study or pilot project to ensure that implementationof the medical support regulations would have no adverse impact on theStates. <T3>Response: </T3>OCSE realizes that the implementation of the medicalsupport regulations will require additional efforts and expenditures, butthe long-term benefit to the children and the Medicaid savings should wellexceed the implementation costs. States should look beyond the IV-D agencyperspective to the cost-benefit potential for the State as a whole whencomparing Medicaid savings and IV-D costs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>45 CFR 306.51 (b)(3) and (b)(5) of this regulation contain informationcollection requirements which are subject to OMB review under the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511). The public is not required to complywith these information collection requirements until OMB approves themunder section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act. A notice will be publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>when OMB approval is obtained. <ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Impact Analysis </ITAG>The Secretary has determined, in accordance with Executive Order 12291that this regulation does not constitute a ``major'' rule. A major ruleis one that is likely to result in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The Executive Order requires that, for major rules, we prepare a regulatoryimpact analysis which describes the potential benefits and costs of therule, together with the potential benefits and costs of alternative approaches.The regulation will have little or no net economic effect, because it willnot change substantially the total amount that will be spent on medicalcare for dependent children of absent parents. The effect here is not thelevel of medical coverage but rather who will finance it_parents, third-partypayors, and ultimately, employers and employees who pay premiums, versusthe Medicaid program and taxpayers. As total expenditures will remain aboutthe same, this regulation only results in a redistribution of resources.As the purpose of this regulation is to provide enhancements of a limitednature to current medical support enforcement requirements, no effectivealternatives to this approach were apparent. This regulation merely expandsthe audience of current medical support enforcement requirements to includecertain targeted cases as identified by the State. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354), we are requiredto prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for those rules which willhave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.This regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysisis not required. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 306 </ITAG>Child Support, Grant programs/social programs, Medicaid, Reporting andrecordkeeping requirements. <ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs No. 13.783, ChildSupport Enforcement Program) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: April 8, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Wayne A.
