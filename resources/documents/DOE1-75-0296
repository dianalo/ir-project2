The bestsystem configuration included flushing manure collection, effluent heatrecovery and direct combustion of the gas. The economic performance ofthermophilic systems was found to be significantly better than systemswith mesophilic operation, and optimization revealed an operating pointclose to thermophilic conditions which improved performance still further.The results are most sensitive to, variables or inputs which can changethe size of the digester, the price of energy, and the efficiency ofenergy conversion.</TEXT></DOC>
