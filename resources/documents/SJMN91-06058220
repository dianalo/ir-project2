We have an older brother from Mother's first marriage.;    My youngerbrother (I'll call him Phil) and I have been helping Mother financially sinceDad died. He didn't leave much.

Please enclose self-addressed,stamped envelope.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Out of the blue, Phil and I received registered letters from our mother andstepbrother informing us that we must pay all Mother's outstanding bills anddouble our monthly support. The letter said if we failed to comply with thisorder, they would institute a lawsuit and attach our wages.;    When Icontacted Mother about the letter, she said, &quot;Yes, I approved it, and you'dbetter take it seriously. The law is on our side.&quot;;    Phil and I have doneeverything possible for our mother and can't understand why she would do thisto us. We need advice.;    -- Redlands;    DEAR RED -- I checked with JohnBeckstrom, professor of family law at Northwestern University Law School, andwas surprised at what he had to say. Here it is:;    &quot;If your mother is needyand unable to work, you could be required to pay her bills. When a parentbecomes destitute, the so-called 'poor laws' in many states (California isone) require children to pay the parent's bills and reimburse the state forany support it provides.&quot;;    The reverse is also true, according toBeckstrom. No state has yet required a child to support his parents if theyare not destitute.; DEAR ANN -- I've been married to the world's sweetest guyfor five years. I would do anything in the world for him, but his kids aremaking me crazy. Thank heavens they live with their mother, but they seem tobe at our house constantly. When they show up (always with no warning) theybring a gang of friends, all wild.;    These roughnecks go through the entirehouse -- bedrooms, bathrooms, closets, drawers -- and help themselves toanything in the fridge. When they show up in the afternoon, we know they willhang around for supper. This means the meal I planned for five has to bestretched to feed nine or 10, depending on how many extras are present.;    Mychildren are quiet and well-behaved. They are embarrassed by the language andsexual remarks of their step-siblings. Last evening when my husband's16-year-old daughter fed spaghetti to her boyfriend, mouth-to-mouth, my10-year-old said &quot;Gross!&quot; and left the table.;    I can't get any help fromthe mother of these children. She doesn't speak to me. Incidentally, I hadnothing to do with their divorce.;    -- Chicago Headache;    DEAR CHICAGO --&quot;The world's sweetest guy&quot; needs to go with you for joint counseling and get ahandle on what's happening.;    Remind your husband of an interestingstatistic. When second marriages fail, eight times out of 10 it's because ofthe children of a prior marriage.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Ann Landers column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910227  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  542  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday February 27, 199100058220,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
