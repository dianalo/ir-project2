The Greens became the first new party in 70 years to make itsway into Sweden's parliament, winning 20 seats in the 349-memberRiksdag.   Their popularity was boosted by ecological concern and a plaguethat killed thousands of seals in the northern seas, making theenvironment the top issue in the election campaign.   The Swedish environmentalists became the second largest Greensparty in Europe, winning 5.5 percent of the vote.   Greens hold 43 seats in the West German Bundestag, about 9percent of the total. Environmental parties also are in theparliaments of Italy, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg,Portugal, Iceland and Finland.   The Greens also won seats in 260 of Sweden's 284 municipalcouncils. But party officials said that as of late Monday theloose-knit organization had no members to fill all its seats in 23of them.   Party official Anders Lindberg said that in some districts theGreens had asked people not to vote for them for lack of localcandidates, and urged them to support other local parties withstrong environmental programs.   But Greens ballots were available at all polling stations, andmany voters ignored the call.   In Sweden, anyone can register as a candidate for local officesimply by writing his or her name on the ballot.   Lindberg said that when early opinion polls indicated strongsupport for the Greens, ``we had to urge our more reluctant,passive members to put their names down'' as candidates.   ``Now there are a handful of cases where we have no members totake our seats,'' Lindberg said. He expressed concern that ``aperfect stranger'' hostile to the environmentalists could take aGreens seat.   If no candidate is registered, the seat will remain empty forthe three-year term.   The Greens also face the question of whether to give up theirdecentralized ideology and organize a more rigid party machinery.They have virtually no national organization or official partyleaders, but two people, Eva Goes and Birger Schlaug, have emergedas semiofficial spokesmen.   The Greens advocate abolishing nuclear power within three years,raising taxes on energy and allocating more funds to alternativeenergy sources.   The party also campaigned for developing the railway system totake air-polluting cars and buses off the roads, stopping theburning of toxic waste, putting industry under stricter pollutioncontrols, and encouraging biological farming.   One problem the party's victory resolved was its financial debtsfrom its unsuccessful 1982 election bid. As a sitting party inparliament, the Greens will receive government funds _ up to $1million during its first year.</TEXT></DOC>
