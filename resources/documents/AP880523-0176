They said Syria's rejection of an Iranian proposal to join sucha force was conveyed by Syria's military intelligence chief inBeirut, Brig. Gen. Ali Hammoud, at a six-hour meeting with Iran'sdeputy foreign minister, Hossein Sheikholeslam, that ended at dawnMonday.   Mortar and howitzer fire pounded the 16 square miles oftin-roofed shanties and narrow alleyways Monday, killing 13 peopleand wounding 78, police said.   In east Beirut, President Amin Gemayel's Phalange fighters andmen of the main Christian militia Lebanese Forces fought withmachine guns and hand grenades Monday night for control of thecapital's Christian sector.   Police said five combatants were wounded in the Sin el-Fildistrict, including at least one Phalangist and two from theLebanese Forces. They said fighting began after Lebanese Forcesgunmen wounded Nabil Kahhaleh, Phalangist commander in thedistrict, and that it abated at about 11 p.m.   Representatives of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party ofGod, and the pro-Syrian Amal militia also attended the overnightmeeting between Syria and Iran.   Monday's casualties raised the toll to 279 killed and 951wounded since battles for control of the slums broke out May 6between Hezbollah and Amal.   The Lebanese officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said the dispute over who would serve in a military force in theslums again delayed Syria's plans to try to end the fighting.   Most of the 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon, including nineAmericans, are believed held by Hezbollah-affiliated kidnappers inthe embattled enclave.   Two Beirut dailies, the independent An-Nahar and leftistAs-Safir, reported that Hammoud and Amal representatives insistedthat the Syrian army take charge of security in south Beirut.   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, endorsed thedemand.   ``There is no other alternative. The Syrian army has to go in tostop the bloodletting and end the plight of the population,'' Hosssaid in a statement.   An-Nahar quoted the Iranian deputy foreign minister as sayingIran would approve a Syrian military intervention in the slums onlyif the hostage situation was resolved ``in a way that serves theobjective for which they were kidnapped.''   Sheikholeslam did not elaborate, but An-Nahar quoted him assaying the hostages were a ``vital issue for Iran.''   Iran also demanded guarantees that Hezbollah will be free tocontinue political activity in the slums after the Syriandeployment.   Syria has kept massed around the slums about 7,500 troops, 100tanks and 400 armored vehicles since Hezbollah overran Amalstrongholds to seize control of 90 percent of the urbanbattleground.   Syria is Iran's main Arab ally in the 7{-year-old Persian Gulfwar against Iraq, long a rival of Syria in Arab politics.   But Hezbollah's move to dominate Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiiteshas strained that alliance.   The Syrians consider neighboring Lebanon to be vital to theirsecurity.   Amal spokesmen have complained that delaying Syrian deploymentwill only prolong suffering of thousands of civilians trapped inthe slums.   Police have said about 70 percent of the slums' estimated250,000 residents have fled to safer areas.</TEXT></DOC>
