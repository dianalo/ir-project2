<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-36-0365 </DOCNO><TEXT>Experimental evidence from differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffractionand ac and dc electrical conductivity measurements is presented to showthat melt-grown CuSnI/sub 3/ and CuPbI/sub 3/ samples have hexagonalstructure, while KPbI/sub 3/ has a tetragonal structure at room temperature.It is also shown that other phases of CuPbI/sub 3/ and KPbI/sub 3/ existat high temperature. All samples exhibit conductive properties whichare suggestive of anionic vacancy diffusion. The measured room temperatureconductivities are 1.11 X 10/sup -5/, 7.1 X 10/sup -8/ and 2.62 X 10/sup-9/ ({Omega} cm)/sup -1/ for CuSnI/sub 3/, CuPbI/sub 3/ and KPbI/sub3/ respectively. Several interpretations of the results are suggested.20 refs.; 8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
