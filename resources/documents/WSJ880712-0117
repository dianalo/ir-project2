West German officials said the SEC issued its request for assistance to the West German Finance Ministry for information relating to purchases of Sterling Drug shares at a time when F. Hoffmann-La Roche andamp; Co. of Switzerland and Eastman Kodak Co. of the U.S. were bidding for the U.S. pharmaceutical group. Kodak won that contest in January with a $5.1 billion offer for Sterling Drug.    The finance ministry responded by asking the German Bank Federation and the Association of West German Stock Exchanges to support the SEC investigation.    West German officials involved in the request declined to identify the West German banks believed to be involved in Sterling stock purchases. It also wasn't immediately clear whether the alleged purchases had been executed for the banks' own accounts or for a third party.    The SEC in Washington declined to comment, referring to its standing policy regarding continuing investigations.    Last March the SEC reportedly issued subpoenas to numerous U.S. securities firms as part of its investigation into possible insider trading in Sterling shares. In May, the U.S. agency requested and received information from Hoffmann-La Roche regarding the Sterling Drug case. The Swiss Bankers Association, which has cooperated with the U.S. in past, also has been collecting information for the U.S. agency.    The SEC's focus on West Germany is likely to raise new calls for tighter insider-trading controls in Bonn. Insider trading isn't a prosecutable offense under West German law, nor does West Germany have a regulatory agency to monitor securities trading.    Bonn Finance Ministry sources said the U.S. regulatory agency has long been concerned about the lack of West German insider trading laws in an increasingly global securities market. Bankers privately fear that fresh evidence that this loophole is being manipulated could lead to a crackdown on the West German financial community, even to tougher legislation.    &quot;The bigger issue is that we have a huge hole regarding protection against insider trading in West Germany,&quot; said an official at the West German finance ministry. &quot;The question is, how is this hole to be closed?&quot;    The European Community Commission in Brussels, which seeks to impose laws against insider trading throughout the EC by 1992, has been pressing for action from Bonn, one of the few EC members without such laws on its books.    So far, however, West Germany's powerful banking lobby has successfully blocked compliance with EC requests. The banks and West German stock exchanges argue that their existing system of voluntary self-regulation is enough of a deterrent against possible infractions. A banking industry official said the prospect of professional disgrace after being discovered is a far heavier penalty than a prison sentence.    &quot;We believe that moral appeal is a much more effective tool against insider trading. This case shouldn't change our voluntary controls on insider trading, including trading across borders,&quot; said a spokesman for the German Bank Federation in Cologne, the banking industry's leading trade group.    In April, West German banking, insurance, securities and industry trade groups agreed to toughen the voluntary codes as a concession to pressure from the EC Commission. These new provisions included abandoning the practice of embargoing news releases containing market-sensitive materials. Companies have the option of abiding by the rules, but those who don't have a mark against their names in some published stock lists.    The banking lobby supports its anti-regulatory stance by arguing that West Germany's lack of spectacular insider-trading cases in the past shows that the voluntary system works.    Critics of the self-regulatory system -- consumer groups, left-wing politicians and foreign bankers -- contend that the dearth of cases reflect a lack of controls more than a superior moral code. The absence of laws or an independent watchdog agency to monitor the market and pursue suspicious trading patterns, they say, means there's no mechanism to detect infractions.    &quot;The German banks like the voluntary system and don't want it changed. It's just the way things work here,&quot; said an executive at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt. He said tough legislation would raise a number of questions about practices within West Germany's universal banking system, which combines commercial banking under the same corporate roof as securities and management-consulting activities.    Frankfurt brokers regularly speak of broad swings in a company's stock ahead of dividend and earnings announcements and takeover offers. Many cases, they say, can be explained only through actions of insiders. Most recently, shares in Feldmuehle Nobel AG began rising sharply a full week ahead of a planned tender offer by members of the Flick family, who subsequently abandoned their plan. </TEXT></DOC>
