Garcia</HL><DD> 02/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   An old saw on Wall Street warns &quot;Never sell a dull market short.&quot; And traders who sold yesterday's mostly dull market short before 2 p.m. got burned.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average, about flat throughout much of the session, leaped ahead during the final two hours to post a 13.92-point gain, closing at 2171.96.    Most of the day, the market proceeded unspectacularly, lulling traders and investors into believing stock prices might drift lower. Then, technology issues on the New York Stock Exchange and in the over-the-counter market caught fire, carrying other prices broadly higher.    Once semiconductor stocks took off, &quot;everything else got going as well and all the selling dried up,&quot; said Donald Crooks, managing director in charge of equity trading at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 2.47 to 277.54 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.29 to 158.47. Winners led losers 9 to 5 on the Big Board as volume rose to 172.4 million shares from 168.3 million Tuesday.    Semiconductor issues began to advance around mid-afternoon on speculation that data to be released by the Semiconductor Industry Association after the market closed would indicate a healthy pick-up in orders.    Among the big gainers were Texas Instruments, up 7 to 159; Motorola, up 2 7/8 to 49 3/8; Advanced Micro Devices, up 1 3/8 to 22 1/2, and National Semiconductor, up 1 to 15 1/4.    In the OTC market, Intel rose 2 7/8 to 38 1/8, and LSI Logic gained 3/8 to 16 1/4.    Computer and software issues also raced ahead. Honeywell gained 2 1/8 to 67, Unisys advanced 2 7/8 to 103, NCR rose 1 1/8 to 58 5/8 and International Business Machines gained 5/8 to 134 on the Big Board. In the OTC market, Apple Computer rose 3 3/4 to 56 1/2, Tandem Computers advanced 1 1/4 to 56 5/8, Microsoft climbed 3 1/4 to 71 3/4, Lotus Development soared 5 1/2 to 73 1/2 and Ashton-Tate rose 2 3/4 to 28.    But the late report from the SIA wasn't as bullish as some had expected. The ratio of semiconductor makers' orders to shipments, or the book-to-bill ratio, edged up to 1.1 for the three months ended last month, the fourth consecutive advance. Still, the report was inconclusive. Although the ratio was higher, orders and shipments both declined slightly last month, in part because of a holiday-shortened busines period.    &quot;These numbers will clearly take some steam out of the stocks,&quot; said Andy Kessler, who follows the industry at PaineWebber. But while the latest three-month figures may not be so impressive, some companies, such as Intel and Motorola, are indicating to analysts that orders are improving on a daily basis, Mr. Kessler said.    Thomas Kurlak at Merrill Lynch, who has been aggressively recommending semiconductor issues since October, sees several positive trends for these companies right now: Their big customers aren't liquidating inventory any longer. The yen's rise has taken away the cost advantage for Japanese chip makers. And there seems to be a pick-up in demand for these products from the personal computer and military electronics makers.    Auto stocks were mixed: Ford rose 1 1/2 to 75, Chrysler eased 1/8 to 45 5/8, and General Motors fell 1/2 to 75 1/8 in active trading. In a special letter to shareholders, GM Chairman Roger B. Smith said the car maker's total cost reductions in 1986 amounted to $2 billion and that he expects these reductions to total as much as $3 billion this year.    Eastman Kodak jumped 2 to 78 3/4 on trading of more than 1.2 million shares amid speculation that the company was about to announce a stock buyback. A company spokesman declined to comment on the rumors. Some analysts believe that a buyback currently would be an expensive undertaking for Kodak.    Oil stocks fell on lower crude prices. Exxon was down 3/8 to 83 1/4, Chevron dropped 1 3/8 to 50 1/8, Atlantic Richfield eased 1/8 to 68 3/4, Mobil declined 5/8 to 44 7/8, and Standard Oil fell 1/4 to 59.    Diamond Shamrock rose 5/8 to 15, with more than 10 million shares changing hands. Mesa L.P. confirmed that it sold five million shares of Shamrock that it owned with Harbert Corp. Some traders attributed Diamond Shamrock's rise to several recommendations from Wall Street analysts.    Johnson andamp; Johnson sprinted ahead 3 to 80 in active trading. The company filed an application with regulators to produce and market a new artificial sweetener. But the stock already was climbing on anticipation of the announcement, traders said. The company also reported higher fourth-quarter earnings.    Monsanto, maker of Aspartame, eased 3/8 to 78.    Reebok remained strong, rising 3 1/8 to 34 5/8 on heavy volume. Reebok's chief financial officer attributed the activity to positive reaction to the company's products at a sporting goods trade show over the weekend. &quot;Some skepticism that might have existed about the company's ability to keep (growth) going was removed by the positive response to our footwear and our apparel line,&quot; he said.    Some traders said some investors who might have sold Reebok short, hoping to buy it back at lower prices, might have been forced to cover their positions because the stock has been climbing since Monday.    Baxter Travenol rose 3/4 to 24. The company said fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations rose to $59 million from $2 million a year earlier.    National Distillers andamp; Chemical rose 1 3/8 to 58. A shareholder group, including Robert M. Bass of Fort Worth, Texas, said it holds a 5.6% stake in the company.    Paper, forest product and chemical issues, which suffered a bout of profit-taking in recent sessions, rebounded.    Among the gainers were Dow Chemical, up 1 to 72 1/4; Du Pont, up 7/8 to 99 3/4; Union Carbide, up 1/2 to 26 1/4; Kimberly-Clark, up 2 1/8 to 109 1/4; Mead, up 1 7/8 to 68 3/4; Champion International, up 7/8 to 37 1/8; and Weyerhaeuser, up 7/8 to 47.    Diebold fell 2 to 54 after Kidder Peabody removed the stock from its recommended list and reduced its 1987 and 1988 earnings estimates. Donald Zwyer, who follows the stock for Kidder, told Dow Jones News Service it is less likely the stock will outperform the market at its current price level.    In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC composite index rose 4.75 to 408.25 as volume expanded to 149.5 million shares from 143.2 million Tuesday. There were 1,399 issues advancing and 832 declining. </TEXT></DOC>
