Q: Who is on strike?   A: The 8,500 Eastern workers who belong to the InternationalAssociation of Machinists. They are about equally divided betweenaircraft mechanics and ramp service workers, who fuel planes, handlebaggage and drive motorized equipment on airport runways.   Q: How much do Machinists make?   A: Mechanics at Eastern earn a top wage of $18.83 an hour. Thatcompares with $16 at non-union Continental Airlines, $18.78 atAmerican Airlines, $20.05 at United and Northwest Airlines, and$20.10 at Delta Air Lines and USAir.   Ramp service workers earn a top hourly wage of $15.60. Comparableworkers earn $15.51 an hour at American, $15.93 at USAir, $16.53 atNorthwest, $16.57 at United and $17.47 at Delta. Continentalcontracts for the work.   Q: What does each side want?   A: Eastern is seeking $150 million in wage and benefitconcessions to help stem mounting losses at the airline. TheMachinists want $50 million in raises but last week offered to delayincreases for 15 months.   Q: How has the dispute evolved?   A: The Machinists have fought wage cuts since contract renewaltalks began in October 1987. Pilots and flight attendants a yearearlier reached concessionary agreements with the airline thatslashed pay 20 percent.   The National Mediation Board intervened in the dispute in January1988, but no progress was made during a year that included massivelayoffs and cost-cutting. The dispute reached loggerheads last monthafter Eastern rejected binding arbitrtion and the mediation boarddeclared a 30-day cooling-off period before a strike.   More than 97 percent of the Machinists on Feb. 15 authorized astrike. President Bush refused to intervene to delay the strike.Eastern's last contract offer would have cut pay but kept it 13percent higher than workers who took the 20 percent reductions. Itwas rejected Friday, and the strike began at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.   Q: Could the Eastern strike affect other modes of transportation?   A: Yes. The National Railway Labor Act permits secondary boycottsin air and rail travel. If rail union workers honor pickets, trafficon the nation's 12 commuter railroads and Amtrak could be severelydisrupted. Also, other airlines could be picketed and the 14million-member AFL-CIO has asked its members to honor the Machinistsstrike.   However, the union decided Sunday to appeal a judge's orderbarring such secondary boycotts in the New York metropolitan areaand said it would not picket any railroads Monday.   Q: What is Eastern's financial condition?   A: Eastern says it has lost more than $1 billion this decade andis losing more than $1 million a day. It also has $2.5 billion indebt. The airline was bought by Texas Air in February 1986 and sincethen has undertaken a series of cutbacks in an attempt to restoreprofitability. The carrier's workforce since the takeover has shrunkto about 30,000 from 42,000. Eastern also has sold planes, cutprofitable routes, closed its Kansas City, Mo., hub and takensmaller savings measures such as eliminating hot food on someflights.   Eastern has about $400 million in cash to help it meet itsfinancial obligations during the strike. In addition, the pendingsale of Eastern's Northeast shuttle to developer Donald Trump willbring in about $365 million.   Q: Why is Eastern ailing?   A: Management blames union militancy and unrealistic demands andsays it trimmed back operations elsewhere and needs labor to makesacrifices. Labor maintains Eastern is suffering because it didn'treact aggressively and competitively to airline deregulation in1978. In 1983, workers made wage concessions in return for futureprofits that never materialized and stock. Tey don't want furtherconcessions without proof Eastern is being managed with long-termcommitment to its financial fitness. The unions also claim Texas AirChairman Frank Lorenzo wants to strip the airline of assets ordissolve it.   Q: What are the strike's possible effects?   A: The strike threatens to force the 60-year-old airline intobankruptcy. To forestall its demise, Eastern could lay off strikingworkers and sell other assets, such as planes, airport gates orinternational routes, to raise cash. Texas Air could sell theairline, and Trans World Airways owner Carl Icahn has been amongpotential buyers who recently have expressed interest. A separatesettlement with pilots, who are honoring the strike, could allow theairline to keep more planes airborne. And Bush could change his mindand appoint an emergency panel that would force the Machinists toreturn to work for 60 days.</TEXT></DOC>
