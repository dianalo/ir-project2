Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's Panamanian Defense Forces on Tuesday raided the offices of the Panamanian Chamber of Commerce and the Business Executive Association of Panama. Brandishing seized documents, the government promised the arrest of the leaders of the National Civic Crusade, a coalition of business, professional, student, religious and peasant organizations demanding that Gen. Noriega be ousted and investigated for drug trafficking, vote fraud and murder. At 3 a.m. yesterday, PDF gunmen occupied the home of Eduardo Vallarino, BEA president and author of an Americas column on our pages last month critical of Gen. Noriega. Mr. Vallarino faces arrest if he returns home. &quot;Barricada,&quot; the propaganda organ of Nicaragua's Communist regime, has accused the Reagan administration of trying to destroy &quot;nationalist&quot; forces in Panama, meaning Gen. Noriega. It isn't trying hard enough. </TEXT></DOC>
