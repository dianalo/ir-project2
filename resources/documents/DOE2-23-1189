Electrical resistivities increaselinearly from the superconducting onset temperature (100 K) to 450 Cwhere oxygen stars to evolve from this material, and then begin to deviatefrom linear temperature dependence. The experimental results indicatethat electrical resistivity in this material is associated with the defectspecies (charge carrier) population due to oxygen stoichiometry. Electricalconductivities were also measured as a function of oxygen partial pressure(1 to 0.0001 atm) at various temperatures. The conductivity behaviorwith oxygen stoichiometry suggests that the electron holes associatedwith Cu(3+) play an important role as charge carriers in this material,and even at x less than 6.5 p-type conduction is predominant. 14 references.</TEXT></DOC>
