BarnesStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MARKETING, ADVERTISING (MKT) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A widely followed advertising forecaster said growth in national ad spending in 1987 may be less than expected while local advertising may be stronger.    Robert Coen, senior vice president and director of forecasting at the ad agency McCann-Erickson Inc., said total U.S. ad spending -- national and local -- would rise 7.5% this year to $109.83 billion. In December, he predicted a 7.6% increase.    Specifically, Mr. Coen's revised outlook, released yesterday, projected national advertising spending would rise 6.7% this year to $60.65 billion, instead of climbing 7.4%.    Yet he projected an 8.6% increase in local advertising expenditures to $49.18 billion, compared with his earlier estimate of a 7.8% increase.    In 1986, national advertising spending rose 6.6%, while local advertising rose 9.4% and total advertising advanced 7.8%.    Mr. Coen's forecasts, which are followed widely in advertising circles, receive a mid-year revision to reflect the collection of some monthly advertising data.    Mr. Coen attributed the upward revision in local spending projections mainly to stronger local retail and classified advertising for newspapers, and healthier local television advertising in the first quarter of the year.    But national advertising spending won't be as strong as originally projected, Mr. Coen said, primarily because of the absence of a &quot;noticeable&quot; improvement in packaged-goods advertising that he had expected.    &quot;The anticipated improvement in new products and new budgets seems to be delayed partly because of the greater availability of 15-second commercials on television, financial uncertainties surrounding the new tax law and brand consolidations stemming from mergers of packaged-goods producers,&quot; Mr. Coen said.    Mr. Coen's revisions came as many media stocks are hitting new highs in Wall Street trading, including Gannett Co., Knight-Ridder Inc., Times-Mirror Corp., CBS Inc. and Capital Cities/ABC Inc.    Many analysts attributed the increase in newspaper stock prices to factors other than healthy local advertising spending. They note, for example, fears of a strike among workers at newsprint plants have abated in recent weeks, as has concern about the effect of the new Florida advertising tax law on newspaper revenue.    But analysts said the television network stocks have been rising on speculation that ad demand will be especially strong in the network's so-called upfront buying market for the 1987-88 television season.    Networks typically sell about two-thirds of their inventory of commercial advertising time well in advance of the new season, which begins in fall. Most of the remaining inventory is sold quarterly in the so-called scatter market.    Analysts said, however, the outlook for upfront sales remains uncertain.    They noted selling has been delayed, in part because of continuing concern about the effects on commercial prices of socalled people meters, the hand-held computerized audience-measurement devices that will be the official ratings system in fall.    Recent test data from people meters have been erratic, network executives said, which could present difficulties in setting audience-delivery guarantees for advertisers.    In fact, any signal about the strength of upfront selling &quot;is invisible&quot; at present, said John S. Reidy, media analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    &quot;Nobody is doing any buying,&quot; Mr. Reidy said. &quot;There are a lot of people waiting around for something to happen.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
