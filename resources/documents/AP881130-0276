Energy Minister Julio Cesar Gil said that non-OPEC oil exportersalso must reduce their output to help push prices up by roughly $6from current crude levels.   ``We cannot arrive at $18 only with the accord. It is essentialto count on the non-OPEC countries,'' Gil said.   Gil said Venezuela, one of the founding members of the 13-nationOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, will begin contactingnine independent nations which have indicated a willingness to workwith OPEC to reduce the glut of world oil that has kept prices weak.   The nations include Mexico, Colombia, Malaysia, Oman, Egypt,China, Norway, Angola and the Soviet Union, he said.   OPEC concluded its thorny winter session on Sunday by agreeing toreduce oil production from an estimated 22 million barrels a day to18.5 million barrels. The cartel hopes the new agreement will liftprices to the $18 level in the first half of 1989.   Gil said he spoke with Mexican oil minister Fernando YriartValderrama Monday and that contacts would be renewed following thatcountry's change of government on Thursday.   The minister said his country also was satisfied with thedefinition of condensates adopted at the conference, which includesan American Petroleum Institute weight as one of five definingelements.   Condensates are petroleum gases which condense into liquids atnormal atmospheric pressure. Venezuela produces about 180,000barrels a day of condensates, which are not included in OPEC oiloutput quotas.   He said the conference approved a ``scientific, technicaldefinition which is in agreement with the elements proposed by ourexperts.'' The new definition prevents the reclassification ofcrudes as condensates, he said.   But he said an API grade ranging between 45 and 50 degrees is oneof five factors OPEC experts will take into account when defining acondensate. Earlier, Venezuela had insisted on a definition that didnot include an API grade.   He said the definition also allowed for an ``intermediate''product which would be a ``temporary crude'' or a ``temporarycondensate.'' Other elements include gas@liquid ratios and octaneratings, he said.   Gil praised OPEC's new 18.5 million barrel production agreementas ``giving OPEC again the credibility that it is capable oforganizing the world oil market.''   He said the conference decided that oil loans between OPECmembers would be credited to the quota of the receiving nation.   Gil said Venezuela hoped to increase its oil export revenue nextyear by between $1.5 and $2 billion as a result of higher oil pricesand its new 1.64 million barrel-a-day quota.   The new quota represents a 65,000 barrel increase over the oldone but a reduction in Venezuela's share of total OPEC production to8.8 percent, from 9.5 percent.   Venezuela's income from oil, petrochemicals and coal this year isexpected to be around $7.1 billion, assuming an average price ofabout $13.50 per barrel, which does not include Tuesday's price hikeof one dollar per barrel for some of Venezuela's exports, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
