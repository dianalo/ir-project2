The African nation, which in March observed the firstanniversary of its independence from South Africa, has seenlittle oil exploration. It enacted a new petroleum law thisyear and recently announced it will offer most of its onshoreand offshore areas for oil and gas exploration in a licensinground that closes Nov. 1.</LP><TEXT>   Government energy officials from Namibia are in the U.S.to meet with oil companies, including several majors such asChevron Corp., and to provide more information on thislicensing round and the country's oil potential. They willmeet with officials of the U.S. Department of Energy.   The Namibian officials held a seminar here this week forinterested oil companies. And, in interviews, they said oilcompanies are showing increasing interest in Namibia'sexploration offering because of several factors, includingits political stability and its promising geology.   &quot;There is a similarity of the rock formations&quot; to those ofAngola, Namibia's oil-producing neighbor, said Jesaya N.Nyamu, deputy energy minister. Also, he said: &quot;The climatefor investment by the oil companies is ideal.&quot;   Namibia is hardly alone in its efforts. Many nations withoil potential -- such as the world's largest producer, theSoviet Union -- are opening their doors to foreign companiesor else offering them new incentives to search for oil.   The reasons are largely economic. Chiefly, the countrieswant to check declines in their oil production or to expandoutput to provide more revenue, even if it must be sharedwith foreign firms.   Because of the competitiveness of the search and thedeclining prospects for big discoveries in the world's olderproducing regions, the oil companies are increasingly willingto invest in new regions in the hopes of finding giantfields. And the shadow cast by the Persian Gulf crisis overthe security of supplies from the Middle East, which stillboasts the bulk of the world's proven oil reserves, has madethe oil potential of countries in other regionsseem even moreattractive.   Namibia, in the southwestern part of Africa, was cited ina recent article in the Oil andamp; Gas Journal as &quot;one of the fewremaining countries of the world where truly giant fieldscould be found.&quot;   The first onshore prospecting grant was provided as longago as 1959. But until it gained independence from SouthAfrica in early 1990, Namibia's uncertain political and legalstatus had limited oil and gas exploration. Some offshoreleases were issued in 1968 and 1972. In 1973, a joint ventureincluding Chevron made the Kudu natural gas discovery, butthe field hasn't been developed yet.   Seismic work and other recent studies suggest thepotential for extensive petroleum reservoirs, the Namibiaenergy officials said. &quot;It looks very promising,&quot; said LeakeHangala, permanent secretary of Namibia's Ministry of Minesand Energy.</TEXT></DOC>
