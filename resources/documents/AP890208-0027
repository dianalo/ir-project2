While members of Congress ``can still supplement their income''with speech-making fees and political committee contributions,``judges are left with salaries that have decreased in real dollarsby 30 percent over the past two decades,'' American Bar AssociationPresident Robert Raven said Tuesday.   ``The recommended increase for federal judges did little morethan restore lost ground,'' said Raven, a San Francisco lawyer.   John J. Curtin Jr., a Boston lawyer who in August will becomepresident of the 350,000-lawyer ABA, said the lost pay raise forjudges ``will destroy their morale.''   ``The fallout on the federal judiciary is going to bedevastating,'' Curtin said, adding that his organization will lobbyPresident Bush and Congress to raise the pay of federal judges only.   Had the raise taken effect today, salaries for federal trialjudges _ like those of members of Congress _ would have climbed from$89,500 to $135,000 a year.   The annual salaries of federal appellate judges would have risenfrom $95,000 to $145,000; Supreme Court justices from $110,000 to$165,000; and chief justice from $115,000 to $175,000.   ``Congress' rejection of the pay raise quells a politicalfirestorm over raising congressional salaries but foments a seriousproblem within the federal judiciary,'' Raven said.   He said that inflation-eroded pay for federal judges ``flouts thewisdom of our Constitution'' and the lifetime judicial appointmentsit provides.   ``Inadequate and decreasing pay forces all but independentlywealthy judges to forgo their life tenure and market theirexperience and training on the bench in the more lucrative arena ofprivate (law) firms,'' Raven said.   Salaries of federal judges have been raised six times this decade_ and now are 24 percent higher than they were in 1980. But the costof living, as measured by the Consumers Price Index, has risen by 46percent over the same period.   Since 1969 _ a period in which many federal judges say theirbuying power has dropped by a third _ the cost of living has risenby 227 percent.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist had called the pay raises``essential if we are to continue to attract from the financiallygreener fields of private practice the sort of experienced andcapable lawyers whom we want as judges.''   During House debate on the pay raise Tuesday, Rep. Vic Fazio,D-Calif., emphasized the problem for judges. ``There are SupremeCourt justices who make less than their clerks the day after they(the clerks) go into private practice,'' Fazio said.   Raven said Fazio's comment was ``not far off,'' and noted thatsome law firms offer starting salaries of $76,000 a year.   ``Certainly a starting lawyer who receives two years' credit forhaving worked as a law clerk immediately is making more than a trialjudge,'' Raven said.</TEXT></DOC>
