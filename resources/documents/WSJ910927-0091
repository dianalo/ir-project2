Lack of compromise had sparked fears that elections, whichmust be held by June, could be called for November.   Lawmakers had been unable to craft a package to keep thebudget deficit on target. Among the few measures to advancewere a revenue-raising amnesty on tax evasion; higher taxeson second homes, though partly offset by lower taxes onprincipal residences; and mandatory revaluation of corporatefixed assets, subject to capital-gains taxes.   Agencies had robustly defended their budgets. And thecoalition government, which took office only in April, hadn'tinsisted on vote-losing spending cuts, despite criticism bybusiness leaders, unions and foreign investors. If thecabinet misses the Monday deadline to present the budget toParliament, emergency spending limits could be triggered andlead to the government's downfall.                                                                                                          MORE TALKS SET ON AIRBUS                                                                                                          The U.S. and the European Community failed to resolvetheir dispute about European governments' aid to the AirbusIndustrie aircraft consortium and pledged to hold furtherbilateral talks. Under General Agreement on Tariffs and Traderules, the U.S. may ask for a panel to investigate and ruleon the issue. The U.S. seeks an end to governments' subsidiesof Airbus planes' development.                                                                                                          BALTIC INVESTMENT BANK IDEA                                                                                                          The Nordic countries proposed creating a Baltic investmentbank to support economic development in newly independentLithuania, Latvia and Estonia. The bank would have initialcapital of $354 million -- 70% from the Nordic InvestmentBank, 20% from the Baltic states and 10% from financialinstitutions -- and channel global capital for investment inthe three former Soviet republics. The proposal came asBaltic aides met with Nordic Council members Sweden, Norway,Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Greenland and the Aland Islands.                                                                                                          CHINA TIGHTENS BORROWING RULES                                                                                                          China tightened foreign borrowing by domestic companiesand centralized supervision and approval of such loans. Thenew rules limit foreign-currency loans to projects in linewith Beijing's industrial policy and to approved financialinstitutions or industrial and commercial ventures. Domesticfirms' foreign borrowing at the end of 1990 totaled $24.19billion, or 46% of total foreign debt. Separately, the ChinaDaily said most officials in government and state companieswho are prosecuted for corruption are released withoutpenalty. Charges were dropped in 10,000 of the 13,200 briberyand embezzlement cases in this year's first eight months.                                                                                                          TOKYO QUAKE CASUALTY OUTLOOK                                                                                                          If an earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale wereto hit Tokyo, researchers predicted, 9,400 people would bekilled and 147,000 injured. The city's disaster-preventioncouncil issued the report after five years of study. Thecasualty predictions were based on a temblor occurring at 6p.m. on a winter day with about 13.7 million people in Tokyo.The study estimated such a quake would destroy 630,000buildings.                                                                                                          CHARTER ELUDES FORESTRY GROUP                                                                                                          The 10th World Forestry Congress ended in Paris with anappeal to world leaders to spend more money to save forests,though delegates from 136 nations failed to agree on aprotection charter. Developing countries, led by Malaysia,Indonesia and Brazil, want to maintain control of forestresources and blocked a draft charter backed by rich nations.A group declaration linked deforestation to poverty, debt andunderdevelopment, and urged &quot;common efforts to reducepoverty, increase agricultural productivity, guarantee foodsecurity and energy supplies, and promote development.&quot;                                                                                                          EC ECONOMIC GROWTH STAGNATES                                                                                                          Economic growth stagnated in the European Community in thefirst quarter because of the Gulf War's effects, the worldeconomy's slowdown and governments' deflationary policies.   Real gross domestic product in the 12-nation bloc rosejust 0.1%, while inflation continued at a 1.1% rate. Thestagnation might end in the second half, though this isn'tassured, because of interest-rate increases in most EC memberstates.   Contributing to the minimal EC growth was a steep 2.3%fall in French exports. German growth slowed to 0.3%.Investment fell 0.3% overall. Private consumption grew 0.6%in the EC, and government consumption fell 0.3%.   By allowing private courier companies to operate, Denmarkbecomes the fifth EC nation, after Germany, France, Belgiumand Italy, to meet EC Commission demands to end state postalmonopolies.
