Agrees to Purchase By Manager Group </HL><AUTHOR> Jose de Cordoba (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FLS </CO><IN> MIN TNM </IN><TEXT>   Florida Steel Corp. said it agreed to be acquired by a management-led investment group for cash and preferred stock. The total value of the transaction couldn't immediately be determined.    The Tampa, Fla., steelmaker said that under the agreement, a unit of FLS Holdings Inc., a newly formed company organized by Florida Steel's senior management, will offer $255.5 million, or $50 a share, for as many as 5,109,515 shares, or about 85%, of Florida Steel's common stock.    Florida Steel said that each publicly held common share not purchased in the tender offer will be converted into a new series of cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of FLS Holdings with a liquidation preference of $53.33.    As previously reported, the group last week offered to buy Florida Steel for cash and stock valued at $47 a share.    Upon completion of the acquisition, Florida Steel will be a wholly owned unit of FLS Holdings.    In connection with the merger accord, Florida Steel said the company has agreed not to pay any future cash dividends, including the next scheduled dividend.    The steelmaker said the tender offer is scheduled to begin tomorrow and expire 12:01 a.m. Aug. 25. The offer is subject to financing arrangements and a minimum of 3,012,000 shares be tendered, among other conditions. Florida Steel said financing commitments have been lined up.    The company also said it reached an agreement in principle to settle certain class action lawsuits brought last week by a group of shareholders who challenged a previously reported bid by FLS Holdings to acquire the company for $47 a share in cash and in liquidation value of preferred stock. The agreement in principle is subject to the completion of the proposed acquisition, negotiation of a definitive stipulation of settlement and final court approval, among other things.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Florida Steel closed at $47.50, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
