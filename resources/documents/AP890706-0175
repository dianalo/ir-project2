U.S. Ambassador William Brown met the prime minister, head of theright-wing Likud bloc, on Thursday, and a Shamir spokesman saidlater that Washington sees Israel's peace initiative as ``firm andabiding.''   But the State Department in Washington criticized the tough newterms.   Spokesman Richard Boucher declared, ``Partisan declarations,particularly if they appear to be more restrictive or imposeconditions, do not advance the process.'' Boucher added, however,that the Israeli plan still provides ``the most realistic way toadvance the peace process.''   Three parties on the left _ Shinui, the Citizens Rights Movementand the Communists _ filed no-confidence motions against thegovernment in Parliament, claiming Likud's Wednesday decision miredchances of starting peace talks.   In a speech Wednesday, Shamir ruled out several peace optionsconsidered to be attractive to the Palestinians.   He said elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip couldbe held only after the 19-month-old Palestinian uprising there wascrushed, Palestinian Arabs living in East Jerusalem would not beallowed to vote, and Jewish settlements would continue to be builtin the territories.   In Washington, the Arab League declared Israel's election plandead and urged the United States to abandon support for theinitiative.   The Palestine Liberation Organization, which had criticized theelections plan for failing to guarantee Palestinians a futureindependent state, said Shamir's speech ``closed the door to peace.''   PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman also said in Tunis, Tunisia,that peace efforts by President Bush and Secretary of State James A.Baker III _ ``the only ones working for peace'' _ ``now face totalfailure.''   Abdul-Rahman said the uprising would be ``escalated because thisis the only answer to intransigence.''   Israel's peace plan, introduced this year by Rabin and lateradopted by Shamir, calls for Palestinians in the occupied lands toelect representatives to talks with Israel on an autonomy plan forthe West Bank and Gaza Strip. Later negotiations would decide thefinal status of the territories.   Ministers of the center-left Labor Party convened a specialmeeting, but it was postponed after officials learned that aPalestinian forced an Israeli bus off the road and into a ravineThursday, killing 14 people.   Shimon Peres, the party leader and finance minister in thecoalition Cabinet, said the disaster ``tears the heart apart ... Theentire nation is unified in sorrow.''   Energy Minister Moshe Shahal, who had urged Labor to leave thegovernment because of Likud's action, said such political moves were``made pale by the events.''   ``Today's disaster only stresses my belief that at these times weneed the unity government,'' he said on Israel TV.   Peres spokesman Avi Gil said Labor's party bureau would meetMonday to decide what course of action to take.   In Jerusalem, Shamir reiterated at his meeting with AmbassadorBrown ``that Israel's political initiative continues to exist in itsframework such as accepted by the Israeli government and that therewere no changes made in it,'' spokesman Avi Pazner told TheAssociated Press.   Pazner said Brown ``expressed Washington's stand that as long asthe government is not introducing changes into the peace initiative,Washington sees it as firm and abiding.''   Shamir sought to soften Likud's decision by announcing plans to``do the utmost'' to find Palestinian partners for Middle East peacetalks.   He told the daily Maariv: ``I hope Labor will remain in thegovernment. They have no reason to change their position, but it isall up to them.''   Israeli newspaper editorials made light of Labor's threats tobolt. Analysts reasoned that Labor was not assured victory ifelections were held.</TEXT></DOC>
