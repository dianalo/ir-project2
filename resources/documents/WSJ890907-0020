While the Minneapolis maker of medical products didn't say specifically what second-period earnings were, it said they were &quot;expected to exceed&quot; the $2.6 million, or 39 cents a share, SciMed posted in the first quarter. Per-share figures reflect a 2-for-1 stock split paid in August.    In the year-earlier second quarter, SciMed had net income of $948,000, or an adjusted 16 cents a share. SciMed also said it expects to report sales of $15.5 million, compared with $6.3 million a year earlier.    SciMed's stock has risen recently on the strength of difficulties C.R. Bard Inc. has run into with federal regulators over a competing catheter. SciMed said orders for its new Ace coronary angioplasty catheter &quot;have increased recently and remain strong.&quot;    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, SciMed's stock jumped $2.25 to close at $52.25 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
