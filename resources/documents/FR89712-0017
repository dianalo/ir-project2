Section 245A(h) of the Act provides that, withcertain exceptions, aliens legalized under section 245A will be ineligiblefor five years for ``any program of financial assistance furnished underFederal law (whether through grant, loan, guarantee, or otherwise) on thebasis of financial need, as such programs are identified by the AttorneyGeneral in consultation with other appropriate heads of the various departmentsand agencies of Government (but in any event including the program of aidto families with dependent children under part A of Title IV of the SocialSecurity Act).'' Section 245A(h)(2) of the Act provides that such temporaryineligibility does not apply (A) to a Cuban or Haitian entrant (as definedin paragraph (1) or (2)(A) of section 510(e) of Pub. L. 96-422, 94 Stat.1799, as in effect on April 1, 1983), or (B) in the case of assistance(other than aid to families with dependent children) which is furnishedto an alien who is an aged, blind, or disabled individual (as defined insection 1614(a)(1) of the Social Security Act, Pub. L. 74-271, 49 Stat.620). The five-year period of eligibility begins on the date an alien isgranted lawful temporary resident status under section 245A(a) of the Act.  Section 245A(h) of the Act also provides that, subject to the same exceptions,aliens legalized under section 245A of the Act will be temporarily ineligiblefor medical assistance under a State plan approved under Title XIX of theSocial Security Act (Medicaid), Pub. L. 74-271, 49 Stat. 620 (except certainemergency services and services to pregnant women or aliens who are under18 years of age) and for benefits financed by the Food Stamp Act of 1977,as amended by Pub. L. 95-400, 92 Stat. 856 (which includes, but is notlimited to, section 19 therein, the Puerto Rico Block Grant).   It is also noted that a different provision, section 210(f) of the Act,provides that, with certain exceptions, aliens granted lawful temporaryresident status under section 210 of the Act (Lawful Residence for CertainSpecial Agricultural Workers) are temporarily ineligible for aid undera State plan approved under part A of Title IV of the Social Security Act(aid to families with dependent children), Pub. L. 74-271, 49 Stat. 620,or for Medicaid. It is further noted that section 210A(d)(6) of the Actprovides in effect that an alien granted lawful temporary resident statusunder section 210A of the Act (Determinations of Agricultural Labor Shortagesand Admission of Additional Special Agricultural Workers) shall be subjectto the same ineligibility rules as aliens legalized under section 245Aof the Act except that the provision in section 245A(h) relating to assistanceunder the Food Stamp Act of 1977, Pub. L. 95-400, 92 Stat. 856, shall notapply, and assistance furnished under the Legal Services Corporation Act,Pub. L. 88-452, 78 Stat. 508, or Title V of the Housing Act of 1949, 63Stat. 413, shall not be construed to be financial assistance for whichsuch additional special agricultural workers are temporarily ineligible.        No such temporary ineligibility is in effect for: (1) aliens granted thestatus of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence pursuant tosection 249 of the Act (Record of Admission for Permanent Residence inthe Case of Certain Aliens who Entered the United States Prior to July1, 1924 or January 1, 1972); (2) a Cuban and Haitian entrant (as definedin paragraph (1) or (2)(A) of section 501(e) of Pub. L. 96-422, as in effecton April 1, 1983); or (3) assistance (other than aid to families with dependentchildren) which is furnished to an alien who is aged, blind, or disabled(as defined in section 1614(a)(1) of the Social Security Act). In addition, State and local governments may, at their discretion, providethat aliens legalized under section 245A or 210A of the Act are ineligiblefor certain other programs. Section 245A(h)(1)(B) of the Act states thata State or political subdivision therein may, to the extent consistentwith sections 245A(h) (1)(A), (2), and (3) of the Act, provide that suchlegalized aliens are ineligible for a period of five years, for the programsof financial assistance or for certain medical assistance which are furnishedunder the law of that State or political subdivision therein. <ITAG tagnum="84">Criteria Used To Identify Programs </ITAG>The Department of Justice, after consulting with representatives of variousappropriate departments and agencies of the Federal Government has developeda list of programs of financial assistance furnished under Federal lawon the basis of financial need for which newly legalized aliens are ineligiblefor a period of five years. The criteria used by the Department of Justice to identify programs offinancial assistance furnished under Federal law are as follows: 1. Federal financial assistance is furnished for the benefit of individualsin financial need. (A) Financial assistance in the form of grants, wages, loans, loan guarantees,or otherwise, is furnished by the Federal Government directly, or indirectlythrough a State or local government or a private entity, to eligible individualsor to private suppliers of goods or services to such individuals, or isfurnished to a State or local government that provides to such individualsgoods or services of a kind that is offered by private suppliers. (B) Benefits under the program are targeted to individuals in financialneed. Either (i) in order to be eligible, individuals must establish thattheir income or wealth is below some maximum level, or, with respect tocertain loan or loan guarantee programs, that they are unable to obtainfinancing from alternative sources, or at prevailing interest rates, orat rates that would permit the achievement of program goals, or (ii) distributionof assistance is directed, geographically or otherwise, in a way that isintended to primarily benefit persons in financial need, as evidenced byreferences to such intent in the authorizing legislation. 2. The financial assistance is not furnished under a Federal disaster reliefprogram. 3. Eligibility does not require United States citizenship. 4. Assistance under the program is not expressly precluded from being construedas financial assistance by section 245A(h)(4) of the Act. This paragraphprovides that assistance furnished under the following provisions of lawshall not be construed to be such financial assistance: (A) The National School Lunch Act, 60 Stat. 230. (B) The Child Nutrition Act of 1966, Pub. L. 89-642, 88 Stat. 885. (C) The Vocational Education Act of 1963, Pub. L. 88-210, 77 Stat. 403.(D) Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981,Pub. L. 97-35, 95 Stat. 358. (E) The Headstart-Follow Through Act, Pub. L. 88-452, 78 Stat. 508. (F) The Job Training Partnership Act, Pub. L. 97-300, 96 Stat. 1322. (G) Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, Pub. L. 89-329, 79 Stat.1219. (H) The Public Health Service Act, 37 Stat. 309. (I) Titles V, XVI, and XX, and parts B, D, and E of Title IV, of the SocialSecurity Act, 49 Stat. 620 (and Titles I, X, XIV, and XVI of such Act asin effect without regard to the amendment made by section 301 of the SocialSecurity Amendments of 1972). Some of the programs that are listed in andSection;245a.5(c) of this finalrule provide for Federal financial assistance to intermediate State orlocal government agencies or private entities. In several programs of thiskind, the intermediate government agency or private entity uses the fundsfor many different programs of its own. Only some of these private or Stateor local government programs provide benefits for which aliens legalizedunder section 245A or 210A of the Act are, with certain exceptions, temporarilyineligible, specifically those programs having both of the following characteristics:(A) The distribution of financial assistance directly or indirectly (throughintermediate public or private entities) to eligible individuals or toprivate suppliers of goods or services to such individuals, or the distributionto such individuals of goods or services of a kind that is offered by privatesuppliers, and (B) targeting to individuals in financial need. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments </ITAG>A Proposed Rule was published on August 24, 1987 (52 FR 31784-31786) adding8 CFR 245a.4, which sets forth a proposed list of programs of Federal financialassistance identified by the Attorney General. Interested persons weregiven the opportunity to submit written comments on the Proposed Rule onor before September 23, 1987. Forty-six comments were received within thatperiod. Most of the commenters stated their belief that the list in the ProposedRule was overbroad in that it included programs that were not furnished``on the basis of financial need'' or were not programs of ``financialassistance furnished under Federal law.'' Other issues raised by the commentsrelated to the application of the ineligibility provisions to familieswhere not all members are newly legalized aliens (the ``family issue''),and whether to ``grandfather in'' newly legalized aliens who are currentlyreceiving benefits under a program on the ineligible list. These concernswill be addressed in turn. <ITAG tagnum="84">A. Financial Assistance Furnished on the Basis of Financial Need </ITAG>Many commenters objected to a portion of the criterion included in theProposed Rule for use in determining whether Federal assistance programsinvolve ``financial assistance furnished * * * on the basis of financialneed.'' In particular such commenters disagreed that programs should beincluded if benefits under the program are ``targeted to individuals infinancial need'' in the sense that ``distribution of assistance is directed,geographically or otherwise, in a way that is intended to primarily benefitpersons in financial need, as evidenced by references to such intent inthe authorizing legislation.'' These commenters believe that only programs applying an individual meanstest should be covered. They believe that section 245A(h) does not contemplatedisqualification of persons from programs of Federal financial assistanceaimed at the development or rehabilitation of property in low-income neighborhoods.The programs at issue include the Urban Development Action Grants, OperatingAssistance for Troubled Multifamily Housing Projects (Flexible SubsidyProgram), and Rental Housing Rehabilitation administered by HUD. The Department of Justice remains of the opinion that these programs areappropriately listed. The statutory language directs the Attorney Generalto designate programs of financial assistance furnished on the basis offinancial need. Each of the three programs at issue requires the applicant(State or local government, or property owner) to show that the Federalfunds will be used to benefit economically depressed areas. To the extentsuch funds are used to provide housing to low-income individuals, theyconstitute Federal financial assistance furnished on the basis of financialneed. Nothing in the statutory language or the legislative history suggeststhat only programs using an individual means test can be programs of financialassistance furnished on the basis of financial need must use. Our review of the legislative history of this section indicates that Congressintended to minimize two potential adverse impacts of legalization: (a)The financial burden of newly legalized aliens on U.S. taxpayers, and (b)the reduction of benefits to disadvantaged citizens and lawful permanentresidents (``LPRs'') under Federally funded programs because of the participationof newly legalized aliens. The effect of making legalized aliens eligible to receive benefits underan entitlement program, i.e., an assistance program not subject to a fixedannual spending limit, would be higher program cost and hence a heavierburden on the taxpayers of this country (unless the funding for one ormore other programs, which might well be more in the national interest,were reduced or eliminated). With respect to a non-entitlement program,the effect of making legalized aliens eligible would depend on whetherthe program's annual spending limit is reached. If not, then the effectwould be the same. If, however, there is excess demand for the benefitsof a non-entitlement program; if, that is, the program's annual spendinglimit would be exceeded should all persons meeting the minimum eligibilityrequirements receive the benefits for which they would be eligible if suchspending limit were not in effect, then permitting legalized aliens toreceive benefits would force American taxpayers and their elected representativesto choose one or a combination of three possibilities: (a) Letting somecitizens and LPRs be deprived of the benefits of the program, or increasingthe annual cost of the program through (b) increasing the burden on taxpayers,or (c) reducing or eliminating one or more other, possibly more beneficial,Federal programs. It is true that a certain portion of funds for Urban Development ActionGrants is expended for projects which benefit the public at large, e.g.,sewers, roads, sidewalks, parks. However, a significant percentage of thefunds is directed toward providing housing for low and moderate incomepersons. It is this portion of the assistance which is intended to be coveredby the rule. Accordingly, in the final rule the Urban Development ActionGrant Program is marked with an asterisk (*) to clarify the extent to whichfinancial assistance provided under that program is covered by the rule.B. Program of Financial Assistance Furnished Under Federal Law A majority of the comments were directed at the Proposed Rule's interpretationof the statutory term ``program of financial assistance furnished underFederal law.'' The most frequent objection raised concerned the inclusionof the Legal Services Corporation on the ineligible list because, thesecommenters believe, legal advice and assistance received from the LegalServices Corporation cannot reasonably be classified as ``financial assistancefurnished under Federal law.'' Many of these same commenters also pointedout that, by its own enabling legislation, the Legal Services Corporationis not an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government, as theybelieve the statute requires. Finally, many commenters stated their beliefthat to make newly legalized aliens ineligible for services provided bythe Legal Services Corporation would be to effectively deny access to thecourts for many low income newly legalized aliens. The Department of Justice believes that it is irrelevant that legal servicesare not financial assistance. The statute provides that legalized aliensare not eligible for certain kinds of programs, namely, those involving``financial assistance furnished on the basis of Federal law * * * on thebasis of financial need.'' Legal services provided to individuals by theLegal Services Corporation do constitute benefits from such a program.Indeed, the language of section 210A(d)(6) of the Act specifically providesthat the provisions of section 245A(h), making newly legalized aliens ineligiblefor financial assistance furnished under Federal law, apply to an alienlegalized under section 210A_<ITAG tagnum="21">In the same manner as they apply to an alien granted lawful temporaryresidence under section 245A; except that, for purposes of this paragraph,assistance furnished under the Legal Services Corporation Act (42 U.S.C.2996 <T3>et seq.</T3>) or under title V of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C.1471 <T3>et seq.</T3>) shall not be construed to be financial assistance describedin section 245A(h)(1)(A)(i).</ITAG>Applying standard rules of statutory construction, this language impliesthe Congress believed that assistance furnished by the Legal Services Corporationis a benefit of a ``program of financial assistance furnished under Federallaw'' within the meaning of section 245A(h). Otherwise this language wouldbe mere surplusage. There is no reason to believe that such benefits wereregarded differently from benefits under the housing programs that thissame section also excepts from the ineligibility rule and that the legislativehistory clearly shows were understood by the Congress to be covered bysection 245A(h). Neither is the Department of Justice persuaded by the objection that theLegal Services Corporation is not technically an agency or instrumentalityof the Federal Government. Many of the recipients of Federal monies areState and local government agencies, quasi-governmental, charitable orprivate entities which use such funds to finance benefits to individualsin financial need. It is the Department's view that the focus of the inquiryas to whether a benefit comes from a ``program of financial assistancefurnished under Federal law * * * on the basis of financial need'' shouldnot be either (a) the public or private legal status of the entity thatdistributes the benefit to the ultimate recipient, or (b) the form thebenefit to the ultimate recipient takes, whether a cash grant (or loan,loan guarantee, etc.) or goods or services, but rather that the benefitis financed with Federal funds that are targeted to those in financialneed.  The Department also notes that although Legal Services Corporation is aprivate organization, it is described as a ``quasi-official agency'' inThe United States Government Manual, the ``official handbook of the FederalGovernment'' (see the preface of such manual, at iii), published by theOffice of the Federal Register. It is so described because it is requiredby statute to publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> certain information about its programs and activities.The comment that inclusion of Legal Services Corporation on the list ofprograms will effectively deny access to the courts by newly legalizedaliens is unfounded. Pro bono and low cost programs, not supported by Federalfunds under the Legal Services Corporation, are available through localbar associations nationwide. Furthermore, although newly legalized alienswould undoubtedly benefit if they were eligible for such program duringthe ineligibility period, the same is true with respect to the other programsfrom which Congress believed it necessary to exclude them temporarily.Finally, regardless of the policy issues involved, the Department doesnot have the discretion to exempt legalized aliens from section 245A(h)with respect to any program covered by the statutory language unless anexplicit exception is provided. Another frequent objection to the Proposed Rule's application of ``financialassistance furnished under Federal law'' was the inclusion on the proposedlist of employment and job training programs administered by the Departmentof Labor (Senior Community Service Employment Program) and the Office ofPersonnel Management Federal Employment for Disadvantaged Youth_Part-time(Stay-in-School) and Summer (Summer Aides) programs. The issue raised waswhether wages paid for services rendered could legitimately be considered``financial assistance furnished under Federal law'' since considerationwas exchanged for payment. It is the position of the Department of Justicethat the employment opportunities are made available through Federal fundsand are filled on the basis of financial need. The inclusion of these programson the list is consistent with the Congressional intent of preventing thedisplacement of citizens and lawful permanent residents from Federal programsby newly legalized aliens. In addition, the Department of Energy has pointed out that one of the programsincluded on the proposed list, the Minority Honors Vocational TrainingProgram, is limited to United States citizens. Accordingly, the programhas been removed from the list. C. The Family Issue Another frequently expressed concern was how to administer the ineligibilityprovisions of the Proposed Rule to prevent the receipt of assistance bynewly legalized aliens without applying the ineligibility to other membersof the same family who may not be ineligible; that is, family members whoare U.S. citizens or lawful permanent resident aliens. This situation ismost likely to arise in the case of assistance which benefits, and is basedupon, the income of all members of a household (e.g., fuel assistance paymentsunder the Low-income Home Energy Assistance program administered by theDepartment of Health and Human Services). The Department of Justice understands the concerns raised by these comments.However, Congress did not statutorily exempt those newly legalized alienswho are members of ``mixed'' families from the ineligibility provisionsof section 245A(h). Nor did it give the Department any authority to doso by regulation. It should also be noted that the Attorney General's statutoryobligation under section 245A(h)(1)(A)(i) is only to ``identify'' the programsof Federal financial assistance from which newly legalized aliens are ineligibleto receive benefits. The programs are actually administered by variousother Federal agencies, which must comply not only with this statute andregulation, but with the programs' authorizing statutes, and the agencies'own regulations and responsibility to administer programs efficiently.Consequently, the Department suggests that these concerns be expressedto the appropriate administering agency. D. Grandfathering BenefitsThe Department has no authority to ``grandfather in'' newly legalized alienswho are currently receiving benefits under a program listed in this rule.Although it is possible that efficient administration of certain programsmay require a limited amount of ``grandfathering,'' this would be a decisionfor the agency administering such programs.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Housing Act of 1987 </ITAG>Following publication of the Proposed Rule and prior to publication ofthis Final Rule, Congress amended section 214 of the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1980, to provide:<ITAG tagnum="21">Sec. 214(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretaryof Housing and Urban Development may not make financial assistance availablefor the benefit of any alien unless that alien is a resident of the UnitedStates and is</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) an alien lawfully admitted for temporary or permanent residenceunder section 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) For purposes of this section the term ``financial assistance''means financial assistance made available pursuant to the United StatesHousing Act of 1937, section 235 or 236 of the National Housing Act, orsection 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965.</ITAG>Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, Pub.
