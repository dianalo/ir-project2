A hearing on the lawsuit, filed Thursday in Wayne County CircuitCourt, was scheduled today before Judge John Hausner.   ``The law is imposing a double punishment on this person,'' saidHoward Simon, executive director of the Michigan chapter of the ACLU.   The girl faces ``not only the punishment of being a victim ofrape itself, but being essentially consigned to the lifetimeconsequences,'' Simon said.   Hausner could issue a temporary restraining order and ultimatelya preliminary injunction clearing the way for a state-fundedabortion. The ACLU lawsuit, also filed on behalf of the girl'smother, is the first to challenge the ban passed by voters lastNovember.   According to the lawsuit, the girl, whose name is being withheld,was raped last month by three men. The Wayne County prosecutor'soffice said two men were in jail awaiting trial on second-degreecriminal sexual conduct charges in the case.   The teen-ager, who is five weeks pregnant, wanted an abortion butwas unable to afford the procedure because her family is on welfare,the lawsuit said.   Elizabeth Gleicher and William H. Goodman, the lawyersrepresenting the girl, said the abortion ban should be overturnedbecause it denies poor women equal access to health care.   Courts in Connecticut, Vermont, New Jersey and California haveoverturned similar abortion bans, allowing poor women in thosestates to again seek Medicaid-paid abortions, Gleicher said.   Before Medicaid-funded abortions were banned in Michigan, thestate spent about $6 million a year for some 18,500 abortions forpoor women.</TEXT></DOC>
