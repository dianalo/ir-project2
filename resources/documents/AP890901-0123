The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the flightof thousands of refugees provided an ``excellent opportunity'' tofunnel intelligence agents into West Germany.   In addition to traditional espionage activities, the East Germangovernment wants to learn more about the refugees themselves, howthey are treated in West Germany when they arrive, and how theyadjust to a new life in the West, security officials said.
