They are looking at the deduction for contributions tocharity so prized by universities, at the deduction for stateand local income-tax payments so dear to residents of manystates, even at the precious deduction for mortgage-interestexpense that saves homeowners nearly $50 billion in federaltaxes every year.</LP><TEXT>   Right now, more than $100 billion a year worth of taxbreaks, most of which go to subsidize the life styles ofupper-income Americans, are on the table at the bipartisanbudget talks under way at the officers' club at Andrews AirForce Base outside Washington. No one is talking about wipingout deductions altogether, but there is plenty of talk inCongress to limit them, particularly for well-off taxpayers.   The latest assault on deductions is being led by PresidentBush and his fellow Republicans, who are looking for a way tocajole Democrats into accepting a cut in the capital-gainstax without increasing the tax rate on upper-incometaxpayers. Over the weekend, White House negotiatorssuggested limiting tax deductions for the approximately600,000 taxpayers with incomes of more than $200,000 a year.   Whether the Democrats will go along is unclear. But theproposal at least plays to their desire to make the affluentpay. Indeed, some Democrats have even suggested trimmingdeductions for all families earning more than $100,000 a yearand single people earning more than $50,000.   &quot;I'll do anything to go after the pocketbooks of those whohave been enjoying themselves for the last decade,&quot; HouseWays and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, Democratof Illinois, said before the latest round of budget talksbegan two weeks ago.   For affluent Americans, deductions are among the lastremaining respites from the tax man. George Bush, forinstance, shaved $26,370 off his federal income-tax bill lastyear with various deductions -- and he doesn't even have amortgage. According to a copy of their 1989 tax returnreleased by the White House, the Bushes reported income of$483,030. They claimed deductions exceeding $94,000 --including $19,500 for real-estate taxes, $37,900 in gifts tocharity and $28,900 for legal and financial advice.   If deductions come under widespread attack,less-well-to-do Americans would feel the bite as well. &quot;Iwouldn't be destitute, but it would certainly crimp things,&quot;says Robert Gould Jr., 39, a consultant with KPMG PeatMarwick, the accounting firm. He and his wife, a 38-year oldart consultant, bought a Colonial house in Westport, Conn.,two years ago. Mortgage payments consume a quarter of theircombined income. In particular, Mr. Gould fears he won't beable to save the money he will need to send his two childrento private universities.   &quot;The ones who would be affected by this are people in ourage group, people who are in the formative stage of buildingtheir wealth,&quot; Mr. Gould says. His fix to the nation's fiscalcrisis: &quot;Cut spending. Period.&quot;   Curtailing deductions just might solve a political problemthat has vexed the budget negotiators since they began workin May: If capital-gains tax rates are cut -- a move thatwould largely benefit the wealthy who have assets to sell --then what taxes on upper-income Americans could be raised?Republicans, still singing from the hymn book of Reagan-erasupply-siders, insist they won't raise marginal income taxrates, now at 28% for the highest-income Americans. &quot;I am notgoing to vote to raise marginal tax rates because {thatwould} stifle incentives,&quot; says Republican negotiator Sen.Phil Gramm of Texas.   Democrats, meanwhile, have rediscovered the soak-the-richballads of their past, and insist that any tax package musthit the rich harder than the working class. House DemocraticLeader Richard Gephardt of Missouri sounded the war cry lastweek. &quot;We must ask wealthy Americans to pay their fairshare,&quot; he said.   For Democrats, the debate has marked a return to an oldstruggle to use the tax code to redistribute income. Duringthe Reagan years, many Democrats largely abandoned thatcampaign. But now they seem to be embracing it anew. In part,this reflects the ascendency of the son of a janitor, GeorgeMitchell, to the post of majority leader of the Senate andthe son of a milkman, Richard Gephardt, to the same post inthe House. It also reflects a growing sense among manyDemocrats that the glorification of wealth that marked the1980s has given way in the 1990s to public anger about greedand inequality.   Still, Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate FinanceCommittee, said earlier this summer that &quot;the odds areagainst&quot; a broad cut in deductions. Lobbyists for real-estateagents, home builders, charities and state and localgovernments have already mobilized, and hurriedly called ajoint meeting yesterday to devise a strategy to fight effortsto limit deductions.   They worry about how a curb on deductions would affectpeople like Travers Nelson. Mr. Nelson, director of designand development for PersonaCare Inc., a developer of nursinghomes in Baltimore, says if he and his wife can't deductmortgage payments on their new townhouse, they may have totake a second look at their charitable contributions. &quot;Wewon't be able to give as much,&quot; he says.   This isn't the first time tax deductions have been undersiege. In the 1970s, President Jimmy Carter campaignedagainst the &quot;three-martini lunch&quot; -- the deduction forbusiness meals and entertainment -- but to no avail. The 1986Tax Reform Act was more successful in eliminating somesmaller deductions -- such as the write-off for consumerinterest payments and for state sales taxes -- and limitingothers, including the three-martini lunch.   Other attacks on deductions were repelled during debateover the 1986 bill. A Reagan administration proposal toeliminate the mortgage-interest deduction for second homesfailed when lobbyists convinced lawmakers that second homesweren't just for rich folks but were also used by the &quot;middleclass&quot; -- to say nothing of members of Congress, many of whomown homes in their districts and in the Washington area.   Throughout the various battles, the biggest deductionshave remained intact. The deduction for interest payments onhome mortgages tops the list. Its estimated cost to theTreasury is $47 billion a year. Congress did prove in 1987that it could at least nick that sacred cow: It passed a lawthat prevents any couple from deducting interest payments onmortgages that exceed $1 million.   A group called the Alliance for America's Homeowners,formed to protect the mortgage-interest deduction in themid-1980s, is already stirring from hibernation and preparingto fight again. One new argument: With the housing industryalready in a deepening slump, this is the wrong time to cutback housing write-offs.   The deduction for state and local income taxes is therunner-up in size, draining about $22 billion a year fromfederal coffers. That's one the White House specificallyproposed cutting back on.   But any narrowing in the deduction for state and localtaxes would affect individual states very differently, sincethe higher a state's tax rate, the more a resident in thatstate stands to lose. Moreover, in seven states there isn'tany state income tax at all. A new report by theCongressional Research Service says that an earlieradministration proposal to cap the deduction for state andlocal taxes at $10,000 would have had the following,divergent effect: In Illinois and New Jersey, you wouldn'thit the $10,000 cap until you reached $333,400 and $302,900in income respectively. But in North Dakota and Hawaii, wherestate income tax rates are higher, you reach the cap at$84,300 and $88,625.   Deductions for charitable contributions are next in line.They cost the Treasury $17 billion a year and they, too, arebacked by a vigorous lobby. &quot;The adrenaline is flowing,&quot; saysRobert Smucker, a vice president of Independent Sector, anumbrella organization for 700 charities.   More deductions may be on the chopping block as well.Homeowners could get a double whack if the deduction forproperty tax payments is also narrowed. That costs theTreasury $12 billion a year. And then there is the deductionfor medical expenses. That one is already limited totaxpayers whose medical bills exceed 7.5% of their income, ahurdle met by relatively few taxpayers. It benefitsmiddle-income taxpayers more than those in the highestbrackets and costs the Treasury $3 billion a year.   Singling out any one of these big deductions ispolitically risky; indeed, members of Congress are loath toappear anti-housing or anti-charity. Hence plans, like thenew Republican proposal and one previously crafted byDemocratic Rep. Don Pease of Ohio, to trim deductionsacross-the-board for upper-income taxpayers.   An alternative scheme, which has been considered in thepast, is to turn all deductions into tax credits. That wouldhave the effect of ensuring that $1 worth of deductions isworth no more to a taxpayer in the 28% tax bracket than it isto a lower-income taxpayer in the 15% bracket.   Currently, for instance, $10,000 in mortgage interestdeductions saves $1,500 in taxes for someone in the 15%bracket, but $2,800 for someone in the 28% bracket and $3,300for someone in the 33% bracket. If all tax deductions wereconverted into a 15% tax credit, the $10,000 in interestexpenses would reduce a taxpayer's bill by $1,500 no matterwhich bracket he is in. Applied just to mortgage interest,that change would raise more than $50 billion over fiveyears, the Congressional Budget Office says.   All of the proposals are still far from law, of course.But lobbyists opposed to paring deductions already arepredicting the most dire consequences. A letter several wroteto negotiators yesterday chillingly predicted that limitingdeductions today ultimately could doom them altogether.   &quot;Restricting itemized deductions in this manner sets aprecedent,&quot; the letter said, making &quot;all of these deductionsprime targets for future revenue needs.&quot;   ---         The Biggest Individual Income Tax Deductions                                                                                                          Fiscal 1991 estimates of forgone federal revenue, inbillions                                                                                                          State and local income, personal property taxes ..   21.9   Charitable contributions .........................   16.2   Property tax on owner-occupied homes .............   12.4   Medical expenses .................................    3.0                                                                                                          Source: Treasury Department                                                                                                          Deductions: Who Takes Them?
