Radical students held campus and street protests after Chun'stelevised apology from his home Wednesday morning. About 50 tried torush the house armed with firebombs an steel rods.   The 56-year-old former general, who seized power in 1980 and leftoffice in February, said he would surrender $24 million and go intorural exile, a traditional form of penance for Korean leaders.   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said he felt Chun was ``personallysincere'' in the apology but it fell short of public expectations.He and others said it was not enough.   On television, Chun said in a grim voice: ``My dear people, I amreally sorry. I have to bear full responsibility for the past sevenyears, which is branded by the people as an era of authoritarianismand misdeeds, although I tried to do my best in my way.''   Looking tired and strained, he apologized for corruption and andother scandals and offered to surrender his personal property,including a $1.4 million house, two golf club memberships and $3.3million in cash. Chun also said he would return the equivalent ofabout $20 million in political funds.   He and his wife, Lee Soon-ja, left their home after the speechfor rural exile.   They spent the first day at a remote Buddhist temple in easternSouth Korea. News reports said the couple would stay in a nearbyvillage for a time, but would have to move periodically because ofthreats by radical groups to punish Chun.   Government sources, not identified, were quoted in newspaperreports as saying President Roh Tae-woo was expected to issue astatement soon asking the nation to forgive his predecessor. Theyalso were quoted as saying Roh wanted to meet with oppositionleaders.   Kim Dae-jung said the National Assembly should appoint a specialprosecutor to investigate allegations about Chun, his family andassociates. Kim is president of the Party for Peace and Democracy,the main political opposition.   He said Chun should appear before investigating committees and``make public in a manner convincing to the people'' how he acquiredand spent political funds, which Kim said amounted to ``billions ofdollars.''   Another opposition leader, Kim Young-sam, joined the call for aspecial prosecutor. ``The truth must be clearly disclosed regardlessof such an apology,'' he said.   Contrasting views of Chun's apology came from a young woman whois an office clerk and an elderly one working as a street vendor.   ``He looked pitiful and we may forgive him,'' said Kim Un-knyong,26. ``I think we have done enough and it is good for the nation toclose the case now.''   The peddler said: ``I hate him. I don't trust whatever he says.... The figure he is talking about is something astronomical, whichwe can only dream of.''   Some of the 5,000 police ringing the neighborhood of Chun's homedrove the attacking students away. The Chuns already had left.   About 200 students at Seoul National University fought riotpolice for an hour with firebombs and rocks, demanding the formerpresident be arrested on corruption and othe charges.   Peaceful street marches were reported in Kwangju and Taejon.   Chun asked for forgiveness in his television speech, but said hewould accept the people's judgment. He asked to be allowed to remainin South Korea.   ``I deeply repent my sins,'' he said. ``I'm ready to face anysufferings and will not shirk responsibility for the results of mydeeds.''   He denied sending money out of the country.   ``I don't have a piece of land or a penny abroad,'' Chundeclared. ``If I have any undeclared wealth abroad, I will take anypunishment.''   The former president has denied personal corruption, but some ofhis relatives and associates have been convicted of or charged withembezzlement and other crimes.   He apologized for the dismissal of government officials andjournalists when he seized power, the deaths of oppositionsupporters sent to internment camps and the corruption of peopleassociated with him.   Chun made a special apology for the bloody suppression of a 1980uprising in the southern city of Kwangju. About 200 people werekilled and more than 800 injured, by official count, but otherestimates put the casualties much higher.</TEXT></DOC>
