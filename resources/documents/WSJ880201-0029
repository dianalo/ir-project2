John Sununu predicted recently the outcomes of the early presidential contests, Ken Bode challenged him with a wager. The Republican governor accepted the bet, with a free dinner for the winner.    Mr. Bode, NBC's chief political correspondent, acknowledges that he made a &quot;bum bet,&quot; but he's pleased, anyway. &quot;I'll get a dinner with the governor either way, and that's what I wanted,&quot; he explains.    Mr. Bode's willingness to lose a bet to spend an evening with a governor reveals a man who thrives on politics. The NBC correspondent used to be a political scientist and a Democratic Party operative. &quot;Ken Bode has a superior knowledge of the mechanics of the process -- because he used to do it,&quot; says Roger Stone, an adviser to Republican presidential hopeful Jack Kemp.    No one doubts that television is critical to presidential politics. But it can be superficial and occasionally supercilious such as when the three networks carry essentially the same reports carefully orchestrated by the White House, or the predictable and pedestrian 90-second reports on campaign events or even the nine-minute shrill shouting match between Vice President George Bush and CBS anchor Dan Rather last week.    But Mr. Bode and a handful of others -- including Bob Schieffer and Bruce Morton of CBS and Jim Wooten of ABC -- try to escape the limits of the medium by delving beneath the surface and offering perspective on the daily hustle and bustle of American politics.    Mr. Bode has reported on vote-buying in little Mingo County, W.Va., for example, and on the hopes and sorrows of blacks in Neshoba County, Miss., who remember when they were afraid to vote. On the &quot;Today&quot; show this morning, Mr. Bode focuses on two followers of Republican presidential hopeful Pat Robertson as examples of the TV evangelist's network of amateurs.    Some critics think Mr. Bode's lack of a journalistic background sometimes causes sloppiness and shortcuts. He and NBC had to settle a $4 million libel suit two years ago. Others contend his liberal Democratic background can lead to biased reports.    His betting colleague, Gov. Sununu, says he is sometimes concerned that Mr. Bode's stories are the product of a &quot;preconceived idea that can be shaped by liberal Democratic values.&quot; Others say it's a problem of exuberance rather than bias, such as when he called Democratic presidential hopeful Bruce Babbitt &quot;the emerging favorite longshot&quot; on a recent &quot;Today&quot; show.    Whether the prediction pans out or not, the Babbitt story shows the enormous influence TV has on a campaign -- and suggests why candidates are so susceptible to TV correspondents. After he called Mr. Babbitt &quot;the idea man of the Democratic Party,&quot; Mr. Babbitt's New Hampshire headquarters received $10,000 in contributions and 70 new volunteers in the state, according to Michael Muir, the state campaign manager.    The 48-year-old Mr. Bode's work habits suggest a driven man -- and one not above petty espionage to get a story. Mr. Bode eats in &quot;two-fer&quot; restaurants -- places where he's likely to see political sources as well as get a meal. And when he's waiting for interview subjects, Mr. Bode eavesdrops on secretaries to see who's calling their bosses, and sometimes asks to speak to the caller as well.    Still, Mr. Bode and his two producers, James Connor and Thomas Corpora, are up against the inherent weaknesses of television, where severe time constraints can result in cursory reports. His typical &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; report is occasional and quick, usually less than two minutes. To counterbalance that, he regularly contributes to the &quot;Today&quot; show, which provides him with about five minutes of airtime.    Unlike some of his colleagues, Mr. Bode prefers the show with the smaller audience because of its greater flexibility. &quot;I wouldn't give up doing the 'Today' show for anything,&quot; he says. &quot;The difference between an audience of five million (for the 'Today' show) and 15 million (for 'Nightly News') doesn't matter to me.&quot;    Recently, he used the &quot;Today&quot; show to provide a spirited defense of the Iowa caucuses, which lately have come under attack as skewing the presidential-nomination process, confessing his partiality as a native Iowan. &quot;I like to get pieces on the 'Today' show, because it allows me to put in my own perspective,&quot; Mr. Bode says.    Mr. Bode may have brought too much of his own perspective to one report, however. In 1985, in an &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; report, he disclosed that W.R. (Buster) O'Brien, the unsuccessful Republican candidate for Virginia's attorney general, hadn't played football for three professional teams as Mr. O'Brien had contended. For that portion of the story, NBC showed tape of Mr. O'Brien at the state prison, including standing behind bars, with a Bode voice-over saying &quot;a politician who adds a phony line to his resume could wind up with an all-expense-paid visit to a place like this.&quot;    Mr. O'Brien sued NBC and Mr. Bode for $4 million, charging that the report gave the false impression that he had committed a crime and was facing a prison sentence. NBC settled out of court with Mr. O'Brien for an amount that wasn't disclosed, but reportedly was for six figures. Mr. O'Brien contends that he was &quot;set up&quot; by Mr. Bode who requested to go along on a tour of the prison because Mr. Bode was interested in the candidate's views on penal reform. Mr. Bode says, &quot;The idea that we set him up is totally preposterous, and I never intended to harm Mr. O'Brien.&quot;    Before getting into journalism, Mr. Bode taught political science at Michigan State University and the State University of New York until joining George McGovern as his floor coordinator at the 1968 Chicago convention. He later served as the research director of the commission that wrote procedural reforms for the Democratic Party after the 1968 election. Wearing the long hair of the era, Mr. Bode &quot;was anti-establishment, for power to the people,&quot; recalls Bonnie Campbell, a colleague at that time who now is the state chair of the Iowa Democratic Party.    As a longtime student of politics, Mr. Bode has an encyclopedic knowledge of the players (he can name the man who accompanied Robert Kennedy into a back room of a courthouse in 1968 to change his shirt, for example) and their politics (he knows the tax assessors and sheriffs that Louisiana politicians use to build their machines).    He also remembers utterances that some of them would like to forget: When Vice President George Bush was haunted by his denunciation in the 1980 primaries of Ronald Reagan's campaign promises on the economy as &quot;voodoo economics,&quot; Mr. Bush attempted to disavow the remark. &quot;I didn't say it,&quot; he told surprised reporters in 1982. &quot;I challenge anyone to find it.&quot; Mr. Bode did. The vice president conceded defeat in a handwritten note to Mr. Bode: &quot;NBC 1, Bush 0,&quot; he wrote. </TEXT></DOC>
