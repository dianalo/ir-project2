A week ago today, the government of Prime MinisterWilfried Martens temporarily suspended King Baudouin'sconstitutional powers after the latter refused to sign a lawlegalizing abortion that had been voted on and approved bythe lower house of the Belgian Parliament. Before the law wasapproved by the upper house last fall, The Wall StreetJournal Europe published an article in which I stated thatKing Baudouin would not sign the abortion bill. This had beenconfirmed to me by reliable sources.</LP><TEXT>   A law in Belgium needs the approval of both houses ofParliament and the king. The king never refuses to sign ademocratically approved text, but in this case he hadconscientious objections. King Baudouin is a Catholic withclose links to the charismatic renewal movement, and as suchhe sees abortion as a form of murder. Furthermore, he and hiswife, Queen Fabiola, are childless and as a result caredeeply for children. &quot;For many years we struggled to fathomthe meaning of this sorrow. But gradually we came tounderstand that, having no children ourselves, we have moreroom in our hearts for loving all, truly all children,&quot; theking told the nation some years ago.   A refusal on the part of the king to sign a democraticallyapproved law might, however, have severe consequences forBelgium's constitutional order. The king seems to have knownthis, and was prepared to take the risk. &quot;I would soonerabdicate than legalize abortion,&quot; he said.   When, last October, I heard the news about the king'sobjections I informed my newspaper's editor in chief. He isthe former spokesman of Prime Minister Martens, still belongsto the prime minister's inner circle, and often uses thenewspaper as an instrument for the prime minister's ChristianDemocratic Party. The Belgian Christian Democrats, althoughthey opposed the abortion law, were not prepared, for thesake of their Socialist coalition partners, who favorabortion, to risk a government crisis over the issue.   My editor in chief was not interested in the story. TheWall Street Journal Europe, however, was. It ran my piece onthe king's position and the looming constitutional dispute inBelgium in its Nov. 1 issue.   The Belgian newspapers made no mention of the king'sstand. They apparently considered the position of the Belgianhead of state to be something the Belgians should not beinformed of. The Christian newspapers all wanted to keep thenews down, as they all have close links to the ChristianDemocratic Party. The Socialist and liberal newspapers didnot like the news, as they favored the abortion legislation.And Belgium has no neutral newspapers, free of politicalpartisanship. Which is why for many Belgians the news of theking's refusal to sign the law might have come as a surprise.   After the Journal ran my article, my editor in chief toldme I could no longer write for foreign publications as ajournalist of his newspaper.   I did make one false prediction, however, in my articlefor the Journal. I concluded that the king's refusal mightlead to a constitutional crisis. This did not happen. Thepoliticians just ignored the constitution. Mr. Martens simplysuspended the king's powers for two days and had thegovernment sign the abortion law instead. In order to do thisthe government invoked Article 82 of the Belgianconstitution, which had been used during World War II whenthe king was in the hands of the enemy -- the Nazis -- andthe government had taken over the king's powers. Apparently,the government supposes that the king is in the hands of theenemy again -- not the Nazis, but his own conscience.   ---   Mr. Belien was on the foreign desk of Gazet van Antwerpen.He was fired after this article appeared in The Wall StreetJournal Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
