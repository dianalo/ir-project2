In a complaint issued by the Newark, N.J., branch of theNLRB, the federal agency claims the Sony Corp. unitphotographed employees who were union members and used thephotos in an anti-union videotape. The tape was shown toworkers shortly before they cast their votes in March todecide whether to decertify the union. The election resultedin a majority vote for decertification.</LP><TEXT>   What constitutes an unfair labor practice, according tothe complaint, is the company's failure to explain thepurpose of the photos to representatives of Local 888 of theUnited Food and Commercial Workers International Union, anaffiliate of the AFL-CIO.   Union representatives had asked for such an explanationafter employees complained about invasion of privacy andgeneral uneasiness about having their pictures taken whilebusy at work. The company had an obligation to explain theactions, the NLRB claims, because the photographing affectedworking conditions.   &quot;People were intimidated by the photographing,&quot; said LarryCary, a labor lawyer at the New York law firm Vladeck,Waldman, Elias andamp; Engelhard, which represents the union. &quot;It'soutrageous for the company to have invaded people's privacyin this way, to use their pictures without their permission.&quot;   Alfred E. Hayes, a Sony vice president in Park Ridge,N.J., said, &quot;We don't believe the pictures were a problem andwe believe that the election should not be set aside becauseof a legal technicality.&quot; He added that Sony intends tocontest the NLRB's complaint.   The complaint concerns Sony facilities in New York and sixNew Jersey cities. A Sony memo dated March 7, 1990, showsthat decertification campaigns have been successful at Sonyfacilities in other locations, including Niles, Ill., andHawaii. Mr. Hayes said that 300 of Sony's 10,000 employees inthe U.S. are unionized. The union involved in this disputerepresents the most Sony workers.   In its complaint, the NLRB also charges that the companyused a raffle of a 27-inch television before the election to&quot;induce&quot; employees to vote for the company and against theunion. &quot;You can have promotional contests to stimulateinterest in an election,&quot; said Mr. Cary, &quot;but in this casethe value of the TV was too high for the board to believe itwas not meant to sway votes.&quot;   Mr. Cary said that if Sony is found to have had a legalobligation to tell the union the reason for photographing theemployees, there may be an inference that unions have a rightto know the nature of an employer's anti-union campaign. &quot;Ifthe board succeeds here, there may be a precedent for unionsto explore the strategies of employers,&quot; Mr. Cary said.   If the NLRB wins its case at an administrative hearing andin possible subsequent court hearings, it will have the rightto conduct a second election.   ---   SOVIETS SUE to halt U.S. watchmaker from selling &quot;SovietMilitary Watch.&quot;   A Moscow firm, Vremex, accused Gruen Marketing Corp. offalse advertising and unfair competition in claiming that aline of $100 quartz watches is connected to the Sovietmilitary. The suit accuses Gruen, a unit of Jewelcor Inc., ofmarketing the allegedly fake &quot;Soviet field watch&quot; tocapitalize on consumers' current interest in the U.S.S.R.   Vremex -- which translates roughly into &quot;Timex&quot; -- isseeking unspecified damages, a share of Gruen's profits andcorrective advertising. Vremex said Gruen's product,introduced at Manhattan's Russian Tea Room last year, ismaking it harder for Vremex to market authentic Soviettimepieces.   Gruen, which says it is the official distributor of the&quot;red-hot fashion accessory&quot; in the U.S., has touted the watchin ads with the line: &quot;Can 83,000 Soviet infantry commandersbe wrong? Nyet.&quot;   In its suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Vremexsaid, &quot;The Gruen watch is not of Soviet origin,authorization, sponsorship, design or manufacture. Nor is theGruen watch similar in style or design to watches actuallyworn by the Soviet military.&quot; A spokeswoman for Gruendeclined to comment.   The watch, packaged in a caviar tin, is decorated with ared star and the letters, CCCP, the Cyrillic abbreviation ofU.S.S.R.   ---   FORMER OFFICER of defunct N.J. firm admits role in a bankfraud scheme.   Bruce M. Bloom, former chief financial officer of CoatedSales Inc., pleaded guilty to allegations involving a $52million fraud scheme in federal district court in Newark. Mr.Bloom admitted that he and other officers of the defuncttextile converting firm lied about the amount of thecompany's assets in order to secure a $52 millionrestructuring loan from BancBoston Financial Co. in Bostontwo years ago.   Mr. Bloom faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and a$250,000 fine for one count of bank fraud.   &quot;The type of quick fix book-juggling admitted to in thisplea is a corporate tragedy,&quot; U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoffsaid. He wouldn't comment on other former Coated Salesofficials. Mr. Chertoff added that the company's collapse hasbeen estimated to have cost stockholders close to $100million.   Mr. Chertoff said BancBoston has reached a settlement withfour other banks that held accounts for the company.   Shortly before Coated Sales filed for bankruptcy-courtprotection in June 1988, the company was considered one ofthe fastest-growing stocks on the Nasdaq over-the-countermarket, according to Mr. Chertoff. By securing the loan withfictitious accounts receivable, the officers boosted thecorporation's net sales, total assets and earnings per share,he said.   Mr. Bloom's attorney didn't return phone calls.   ---   DIVORCED MOTHER allowed to relocate by a New York appealscourt.   The state appeals court in Ithaca, N.Y., overturned alower court decision barring Marie Reyes from movingout-of-state with her children.   Traditionally, the courts have been reluctant to allowdivorced parents to move to distant locations except underunusual circumstances. The courts don't want to adverselyaffect the visitation rights of the non-custodial parent.   Ms. Reyes, who was divorced in 1989, had asked the courtfor permission to move to Laramie, Wyo., where her presenthusband is a tenured professor at the University of Wyoming.Christopher A. Ball, Ms. Reyes's former husband and thefather of her children, had opposed the move.   In an unusual ruling, the appeals panel approved the move,saying it would result in better educational and economicopportunities for Ms. Reyes. In addition, the panel foundthat the proposed relocation would result in Mr. Ball seeinghis children for longer durations and wouldn't unreasonablydisrupt his relationship with them. The court also reversed alower court decision awarding joint custody and gave Ms.Reyes sole custody of the children.   &quot;We live in a mobile society,&quot; said Cecile C. Weich, aRiverdale, N.Y., lawyer representing Ms. Reyes. &quot;The courtshave begun to recognize the fact that women and men will wantto move to join and form new families and to seek neweconomic opportunities.&quot;   But Richard Stumbar, a lawyer for Mr. Ball, said that bothMs. Reyes and her husband can find work in New York and thereis no compelling reason for the move. Mr. Stumbar, of theIthaca firm Bixler andamp; Stumbar, said his client has appealedthe decision.   &quot;The decision is a departure and a weakening of the rightsof the non-residential parent with respect to the children,&quot;said Mr. Stumbar.   ---   NORIEGA CO-DEFENDANT is sentenced to 10 years in prison ondrug charges.   Enrique Pretelt, a Panamanian businessman and former closeassociate of deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega, hadpleaded guilty in federal court in Tampa, Fla., in June totwo felonies -- conspiring with Mr. Noriega to import drugsand launder money, and attempting to import 400,000 pounds ofmarijuana into the U.S. through Panama.   His pledge to cooperate with the prosecution is expectedto bolster the government's case against Mr. Noriega, who isawaiting trial on drug charges.   As part of his plea, Mr. Pretelt forfeited $108,000 inproceeds from his drug activities to the U.S., theprosecution said.
