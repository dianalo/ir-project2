However, Salah Khalaf admitted the PLO did not have concreteevidence linking the disaster to Israel.   Khalaf, co-founder of Arafat's Fatah, the mainstream PalestineLiberation Organization faction, also renewed a PLO offer to helpWashington's probe into the bombing that killed 270 people on Dec.21.   The Boeing 747, with 259 people on board, crashed into the townof Lockerbie, Scotland. All on board and 11 people on the grounddied.   ``We charge Mossad of carrying out the operation,'' Khalaf saidat a news conference. ``The sole party to benefit from this incidentat this time in particular is Israel because it is seeking toundercut the prominence that the Palestinian issue has gainedinternationally.''   The inquiry into the bombing has focused in part on Palestinianextremists opposed to Arafat's recent peace overtures, which includerecognition of Israel, and on Iranian-linked Moslem fundamentalists.   Among those mentioned as possibly being involved is Ahmed Jibril,a former Syrian army captain who leads a Libyan-funded, Syria-basedPLO splinter group called the Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine-General Command.   Jibril's group has denied involvement in the incident.   ``We have expressed readiness to exchange information about thisincident or any other, because we are definitely againstterrorism,'' Khalaf said. ``But until now, there have been nocontacts by the United States with us to translate this intoaction.''   An adviser to Arafat, Khaled Hassan, told the London Channel 4Commercial Television Network on Tuesday that if the perpetratorswere Palestinians and were caught, Arafat would ``put them in frontof the court.''   Khalaf, commenting on that remark, said: ``We are not yet in aposition to put anyone on trial...we can't even lay our hands onAhmed Jibril.''</TEXT></DOC>
