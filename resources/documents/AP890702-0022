About 5,000 protesters also massed at the airport and about 1,000mostly Western residents held their own rally in support of theprotesters.   The military crackdown on pro-democracy student protesters inChina has caused much apprehension in this British colony, which isto revert to Chinese rule in 1997.   Last week, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of Britain'sHouse of Commons rejected a proposal to allow British passportholders in Hong Kong to emigrate to Britain. About 3.5 million ofHong Kong's 5.7 million people hold British passports.   Hong Kong citizens believe that Beijing cannot be trusted to liveup to its promise to keep Hong Kong's capitalist system intact for50 years after 1997.   In brief remarks upon his arrival, Howe did not raise the issueof mass immigration from Hong Kong. He said he had come here to``reaffirm British determination to secure a democratic andprosperous future for Hong Kong.''   ``You have no stauncher friend than Britain,'' he said.   ``The whole world has condemned the violence and repression we'veall witnessed in China over the last few weeks,'' he added.``Nowhere has that view been more vigorously expressed than inBritain and in Hong Kong. You feel threatened and beleaguered bywhat has happened, so that's why I'm here.''   Howe said the British government believed that the 1984British-Chinese agreement to return Hong Kong to China ``stillprovides the right foundations'' for the future.   At the airport, demonstration leaders gave Howe's personalsecretary a petition with about 600,000 signatures pressing for theright to emigrate to Britain.   The protest organizer, the Rev. Lo Lung Kwong, said demonstratorswere ``extremely dissatisfied'' that Howe did not accept thepetition himself.   ``We feel that he does not seem to have the courage to face theHong Kong people personally,'' he said.   Earlier, about 1,000 Westerners gathered in central Hong Kong toprotest Howe's visit.   ``I've lived here for about 12 years and I consider Hong Konghome,'' said Gasper Jones, a British businessman who came to therally with his two sons, both born in Hong Kong. ``London is sellingthese people down the river. If they don't act and act fast, HongKong as a trading center, as a financial center, is finished. Allthe bright people in my company have left or are leaving.''   Another 10,000 people marched through Hong Kong to the GovernmentHouse, carrying signs that read, ``Howe can you sleep at night?''and ``End to British honor?''   ``I fled the communists in Vietnam in 1975,'' said Lee Ho Fat, arestaurateur who was marching with his family of six. ``I look atthese hooligans in Beijing and ask myself, `Am I going to have toflee them again?' We need an assurance _ the right to live inBritain would help.''</TEXT></DOC>
