The case in the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals involves the issue of whether defendants in a civil suit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission will be permitted to conduct pre-trial interviews -- known as depositions -- with witnesses while a simultaneous criminal investigation of the defendants is under way.    The appeals court ruled late Tuesday that a federal judge did not abuse his discretion when he blocked such pre-trial interviews at the request of the U.S. attorney, who claimed that they would interfere with the government's parallel criminal case.    The case, SEC vs. Chestman, is unrelated to the continuing insider-trading investigation involving Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Nonetheless, it is particularly significant to Drexel because of the precedent it appears to set.    As previously reported, the SEC in September brought a massive securities-fraud suit against Drexel, its junk-bond chief Michael Milken and others. The defendants quickly moved to subpoena some 50 witnesses seeking testimony and documents. But an assistant to Rudolph Giuliani, U.S. attorney for Manhattan, requested that much of that pre-trial testimony, known as discovery, be delayed until Mr. Giuliani completes his related criminal investigation.    The defendants have been particularly eager to interview imprisoned former arbitrager Ivan Boesky and people who worked with him. Mr. Boesky is believed to be the government's chief witness against Drexel and the other defendants.    Mr. Giuliani has issued &quot;target letters&quot; to Drexel, Mr. Milken and other individuals indicating that they are likely to be indicted soon.    The question of whether Judge Milton Pollack, who is presiding over the SEC's case against Drexel, will permit discovery to proceed over Mr. Giuliani's objection remains unresolved because all proceedings in the case are on hold pending an appeals court ruling on the defendants' motion to remove Judge Pollack from the case.    But the appeals court decision in the Chestman case suggests that Judge Pollack might be less likely to permit such pre-trial testimony.    &quot;This was an important decision because it preserves our ability to meet our statutory duties without impairing the separate interests of the U.S. attorney,&quot; said Thomas Newkirk, the SEC's chief litigation counsel.    However, criminal defense lawyers decried the ruling as a green light to the SEC to bring civil charges, damage the reputation of the defendants, and then deny them the chance to use the pre-trial discovery process to clear their names and start defending themselves.    &quot;The basic unfairness is that the SEC brought a highly publicized complaint preceded by leaks based almost entirely on charges made by Ivan Boesky and his cohorts,&quot; said one criminal defense lawyer familiar with Drexel's defense. &quot;And then the government denies the defendants' right to answer the charges.&quot;    Other defense lawyers familiar with the Drexel defense cautioned that the Chestman case involved relatively simple issues, requiring limited discovery, while the Drexel case is the most complex securities-fraud case on record. The legal theories that apply to a simple case might not be applicable in the Drexel situation, these lawyers maintained.    The Chestman decision involves insider-trading charges brought against Robert Chestman in connection with the 1986 acquisition of Waldbaum Inc. supermarkets by the Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific Tea Co. Judge Robert J. Ward permitted the U.S. attorney's office to intervene in the SEC case against Mr. Chestman and seek a stay of pre-trial discovery pending completion of its criminal investigation.    Mr. Chestman appealed to the Second Circuit and also filed a writ of mandamus, an extraordinary motion aimed at ordering a lower court judge to take certain action on the grounds that the judge clearly abused discretion.    The appeals court rejected the appeal as premature and rejected the mandamus on the grounds that there was no &quot;clear abuse of discretion&quot; on the part of Judge Ward. &quot;The government had a discernible interest in intervening in order to prevent discovery in the civil case from being used to circumvent the more limited scope of discovery in the criminal matter,&quot; the appeals court wrote.    In criminal cases, defendants generally haven't any opportunity to examine witnesses against them until cross-examination at trial.    The appeals court's reasoning seems to run counter to that of federal district judge John Sprizzo, who recently refused such a stay of discovery in a different case on the grounds that the SEC shouldn't have filed its suit if it didn't want the case to go forward promptly. </TEXT></DOC>
