The Democrats should take a closer look at this year's script. Mr. Reagan is proposing to spend nearly $1 billion on job training and cash benefits for so-called &quot;displaced workers.&quot;    On Monday, a Labor Department task force issued its final report on federal job-retraining efforts. Most of its recommendations had already appeared as part of the administration's newly released budget. They boil down to placing all current programs for displaced workers -- those who lose their jobs as a result of plant closings or layoffs -- under a new umbrella program. Job-training funding would nearly triple to $980 million from $344 million in the current fiscal year.    Across 25 years of Democratic and Republican administrations, job training has been one of the great dry holes of federal policy. More than 50 different federal job-training programs have been started by Congress over this period. Every few years Congress admits its disappointment, changes the names of the programs, puts some more money into the pot and tries again.    So what's the point of this one? Well, administration officials hope that an additional $600 million or so in displaced-worker assistance will slake the thirst of congressional members now howling for trade restrictions to &quot;protect&quot; American jobs. If that's the strategy the administration expects to block the rising tide of protectionist legislation, it had better invest in flood insurance.    New House Speaker Jim Wright has already signaled his intent to have a trade bill pass Congress by May. Democrats will dismiss that $980 million in displaced-worker assistance as merely a down payment on their own expansive jobs programs.    In support of his proposal, Labor Secretary Brock cites the current Job Training Partnership Act as a successful &quot;model for human-resource programs.&quot; Mr. Brock touts JTPA's successful placement rate of 68%. But Gary Walker, a New York consultant who evaluated the program for the Ford Foundation, points out that those are &quot;largely one-day-on-the-job&quot; figures and refer only to JTPA &quot;graduates&quot; and do not include people who dropped out of the training program.    Another danger is that job retraining often evolves into little more than corporate welfare. Policy analyst James Bovard notes in a Cato Institute study that JTPA has paid for the in-house training costs of such firms as General Electric, General Motors and McDonald's. Each of these companies would have had to train people anyway. With JTPA, Fortune 500 companies were able to get the taxpayers to pay for part of their overhead.    The fundamental problem with these programs is that the government can't predict what jobs displaced workers should be trained for. What if the government in 1979 had decided that laid-off Chrysler workers should be encouraged to move to booming Texas? Where would those workers be now? Would Texas be asking the federal government to pay the costs of shipping out the workers it shipped in?    The Labor task force report envisions &quot;tripartite advisory committees,&quot; composed of business, union and government representatives, to provide guidance for the new labor policies. Richard McKenzie, an economics professor at Clemson University and dissenting member of the task force, notes that the business and labor members of the panel were all either executives of large, unionized companies or the leaders of unions whose high-wage demands sometimes have contributed to plant closings.    Before &quot;displaced workers&quot; becomes another substitute phrase for thinking a problem through, some facts are in order. From January 1981 through January 1986, some 5.1 million workers are estimated to have been displaced from their jobs. But the task force's own report admits that 15% of those displaced workers have since left the labor force -- largely through early retirement -- and that another 67% have been reemployed. Two-thirds of those with new jobs got them within six months of losing their last one. The remaining 18% of workers represent a serious problem. There is little evidence to suggest that the federal government has the expertise to reduce this number significantly.    It is especially ironic that the Labor Department task force issued its jobs program only two days after headlines reported that the stubborn U.S. unemployment rate had fallen to 6.7% -- the lowest rate recorded since President Reagan took office. Mr. Reagan speaks often of the huge number of new jobs created during his presidency, and it is surprising how often foreign officials and businessmen single out this achievement for admiration. It is unfortunate to see Labor Secretary Brock now capping the administration's political and philosophical victory with support for one of the most discredited ideas ever to come out of big government. </TEXT></DOC>
