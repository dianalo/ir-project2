At the same time, however, it has vowed retaliation for theabduction of a Shiite Moslem cleric by Israeli commandos.   Iran's leaders did not react immediately to the killing of Lt.Col. William R. Higgins, who was kidnapped in 1988 while serving aspart of a United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon. Apro-Iranian Islamic group said it hanged Higgins on Monday becauseIsrael had failed to release Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, who wasabducted Friday.   Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said before Higgins'killing was announced that ``the threat against Higgins has nothingto do with us. However, we condemn any kind of kidnapping or deaththreat.''   On Sunday, however, Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi saidin Tehran that Islamic groups around the world would retaliate forIsrael's abduction of Obeid and two companions.   ``The Islamic clergy ... and militant groups throughout theworld will take action against the interests of Israel and theUnited States ... they will not allow them to live comfortably,''Mohtashemi said.   Denouncing the media coverage of Higgins' killing, the Abrardaily newspaper said: ``The trumpets of human rights were not blownat all when the Zionist thieves trespassed Lebanese territory andshamelessly kidnapped a human being.''   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, quotedthe newspaper as saying Higgins' death ``was no more depressingthan the daily killings by Israeli soldiers of Palestinians in theoccupied territories.''   ``With the death of an American colonel, the banner of humanrights is once again being raised ... just because a blue-eyedAmerican has died.''   Israel said Obeid had been involved in planning attacks onIsrael and offered to trade him for three Israeli soldiers held insouthern Lebanon, as well as the Western hostages.   All the groups holding hostages in Lebanon are believed linkedto the Iranian-supported Hezbollah, or Party of God, but Hezbollahdenies it has anything to do with hostage-taking.   Iranian media, which condone the actions of the Lebanese Shiitegroups, carried reports of Higgins' killing from Western newsagencies.   Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's president-elect, is believed to wantto erase Iran's image as a sponsor of international terrorism.   The 1979 fundamentalist revolution of Ayatollah RuhollaKhomeini, who died June 3, helped spawn various Shiite terroristgroups in Lebanon. Revolutionary Guards, sent into Lebanon duringthe 1982 Israeli invasion, helped organize Hezbollah.   Rafsanjani himself was criticized by the West this year when hecalled for the death of five Americans or Europeans for everyPalestinian killed in the occupied territories by Israeli soldiers.   Before Higgins' abduction, Rafsanjani was quoted by an Iraniannewspaper as saying that ``oppressed groups'' had no choice but totake hostages.</TEXT></DOC>
