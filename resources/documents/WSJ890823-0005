Moody's didn't say whether the review has positive or negative implications, but bankers said they expect widespread downgradings to result from the review.    Moody's noted that under the new law, all units of a bank holding company must indemnify the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. against possible losses stemming from the failure of a sister bank.    Bankers were reluctant to discuss the Moody's action. But one bank adviser, who asked not to be identified, criticized the rating service's decision to announce a broad-based review.    &quot;For strong institutions like Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York, this cross-guarantee provision {in the thrift legislation} has no importance, and their rating shouldn't be under review. It only makes a difference when a bank has a weak sister,&quot; the adviser said.    Currently, Moody's ratings on different banking units of the same bank holding company can vary by as much as three numerical rating levels. With this review, those variations are expected to narrow or even to disappear in some cases.    However, Moody's said some rating differentials may remain, depending on each bank's strategic importance and operational integration into the parent company. </TEXT></DOC>
