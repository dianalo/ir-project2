The routine precautions, which allow underwriters to back out in case of political or economic shocks, might have come in handy Oct. 19, the day the global-equities boom collapsed under Wall Street's crash. Luckily for Mr. Li, the back-out clauses expired at 3 p.m. Hong Kong time on Black Monday, 6 1/2 hours before New York stocks began to plunge.    The joint offering of Mr. Li's Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. and its three affiliates isn't drawing much interest. But the timely expiration means its five underwriters and hundreds of sub-underwriters -- unable to back out -- have little choice but to pick up the unwanted stock.    The abruptness of the global crash shocked the financial world. Dozens of companies in Hong Kong, were caught in the middle of major acquisitions or fund-raising plans. Among major players, Mr. Li seems to have been one of the most fortunate. So have the Kadoories, who sold a big chunk of their family-controlled Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Hotels Ltd. five days before the crash.    But Joseph Lau, a bold entrepreneur, was caught between several major acquisitions and an aborted fund-raising. And the Keswick family, which controls Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd., saw two opportunities lost in the market turmoil -- one to sell Jardine's 26% stake in Hongkong Land Co. and another to buy into New York-based Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.    &quot;Everyone is wise after the event,&quot; says Nick MacAndrew, managing director of Schroders Asia Ltd., a merchant bank involved in the Kadoories' share sale and the Cheung Kong offering. &quot;The fact is, no one could have been wise enough to anticipate so quick a change.&quot;    Major companies seem unlikely to face immediate financial blows from the fall, because they've been relatively conservative since the local stock and property collapse of 1982-84. Analysts say smaller concerns may falter in the crash's aftermath, but for bigger companies, the loss is mainly in the form of missed opportunities.    While difficult to measure, the lost chances could have a big impact on the long-term fortunes of companies such as Jardine, whose strategy of funding overseas expansion by selling part of its Hong Kong assets has been thrown, at least temporarily, into disarray.    If Hong Kong's business climate deteriorates, as the British colony approaches its return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, the current loss of opportunities may prove especially costly.    At the time of the stock market collapse, several entrepreneurs -- including Mr. Li and Mr. Lau -- were competing to acquire Jardine's holding in Hongkong Land. Sources connected with the negotiations said Mr. Lau had contemplated an offer of almost 17 dollars a share. Had Jardine accepted, it would have realized more than 10 billion dollars on its Hongkong Land investment. At Friday's 5.85 dollars closing price, the stake's current market value stands at about 3.5 billion dollars.    But Jardine had fared well in the market, up to the crash, raising about six billion dollars in a series of reorganization moves which began last year. Many others, hoping to catch the market near its peak, held off fund-raising plans. They may now face an indefinite wait until the market recovers.    As of Friday, the stock market's Hang Seng index stood at 2113.67, a 47% drop from its record high several weeks ago.    Between Jan. 1 and the Oct. 19 crash, planned fund-raising by Hong Kong companies totaled almost 50 billion dollars. The actual amount, says Terry Fok, head of research at the brokerage firm, Smith New Court Far East Ltd., is likely to reach 40 billion dollars because of several cancellations, still triple the total raised locally in the previous five years.    Stock prices fell in lackluster trading in Tokyo Saturday after a modest rise Friday. The Nikkei average of 225 selected stocks sank 158.01 yen to close at 22637.01. Analysts traced some selling to a weak Wall Street showing Friday, which, combined with the yen's rise to another record high that day, triggered profit-taking in export-oriented issues.    In Friday's trading, the market continued to gain strength from a rally in exportled shares. The Nikkei average rose 165.37 points to 22795.02.    Share prices opened moderately lower in Tokyo Monday. The Nikkei average fell 43.64 in the first 15 minutes of trading, moving to 22593.37.    In London Friday, share prices closed lower but above the day's worst level as the market was boosted by news of a plan to cut the U.S. budget deficit.    The Financial Times 30-share index closed 13.9 points lower at 1274.0. Volume was 574 million shares, well below the 684.9 million shares traded a day earlier. The 100-share index was off 18.0 points at 1620.8.    Some traders were forecasting a modest rally today. &quot;The general feeling is that London has been oversold,&quot; one British trader said. &quot;Market-makers have had positions they wanted to undo. They may be near the point where they want to get (the market) going.&quot;    In other European markets, prices rose in Paris, Zurich, Brussels and Stockholm. Stocks fell in Frankfurt and Milan, and were mixed in Amsterdam.    Equities were higher in Singapore, but lower in Sydney.    In Hong Kong, share prices soared as local traders sought bargains, and selling by overseas investors began to taper off. Blue-chip issues jumped across the board, as property stocks led advances.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                     % This                                Nov 5     Nov 4       Year   U.S. ...................... 238.0     232.9      + 4.4   Britain ................... 491.9     483.6      - 1.2   Canada .................... 333.6     333.6      - 0.1   Japan .................... 1097.4    1115.3      +16.1   France .................... 309.5     311.3      -24.2   Germany ................... 169.7     173.8      -34.7   Hong Kong ................ 1415.0    1484.7      -20.5   Switzerland ............... 151.1     154.9      -24.8   Australia ................. 240.1     246.2      - 9.0   World index ............... 399.6     396.7      +12.0</TEXT></DOC>
