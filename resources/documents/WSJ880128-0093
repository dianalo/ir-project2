He ran the old standard up the flagpole one more time, and just about everyone saluted. The problem, as became clear on a close reading of what he actually said as opposed to how he said it, was that he was using a 13-star flag in a 50-star world.    Two phrases -- which are elided into one below -- from the address establish how removed he is from the reality of his own making:   &quot;Let's be clear on this point: We're for limited government because we understand, as the Founding Fathers did, that this is the best way of ensuring personal liberty. . . . As I indicated in my first State of the Union, what ails us can be simply put: the federal government is too big and spends too much money.&quot;    There are those who believe he is right on both counts. I don't. But whatever the virtues of the rhetoric, in practice this president has presided over the steady growth of government and the continuing accretion of real power in the hands of the state. That he has done so despite monumental, and monumentally successful, assaults on the role of the federal government as the comforter of the afflicted only underlines the point. What Ronald Reagan has done is shift the discretionary budget emphasis of this domestic republic from social welfare to military expenditures.    Furthermore, while guiding that historic shift, he has refused to pay for what he was doing. The result has been more people working for Washington rather than fewer, a disastrously swollen national debt and a federal government -- and economy -- unhealthily centered on military spending.    Take a few figures. In 1981, there were about 2.85 million federal civilian employees. Today, the figure is just over three million, a 7% increase. During the same period, the number of Defense Department employees went up by more than 10% while the non-defense work force was dropping. By 1987, there were virtually as many civil servants working for Defense as for the rest of the government outside the Postal Service. Equally of note, there are another three million people who work directly or indirectly for the Defense Department in private firms.    Meanwhile, the decline in other U.S. agencies' employment has included: Interior Department, 14%; Commerce Department, 11%; Health and Human Services, 17%; Housing and Urban Development, 28%; Transportation, 18%. Those squeezes have taken place while the president was pouring just short of $2 trillion into the military budget. The only reason the tilt was not more pronounced was that Congress occasionally balked.    Even with that resistance, however, a fearful toll has been taken both on the nation's infrastructure and its basic human needs. All the while, the government has been growing in every way except one: the capacity and willingness to pay for what it was doing. That, too, was a matter of presidential decision, since not one of his proposed budgets in seven years would have put the nation even close to the black.    Thus there was a moment of unconscious irony Monday night when the president rang the tocsin about a fourth of the way through his speech, suggesting that &quot;perhaps the most important sign of progress has been the change in our view of deficits.&quot; His apparent point was that everyone, liberal as well as conservative, is now terrified by the Reagan record deficits and his $1 trillion addition to the national debt. But someone else might have read it to mean the president's own blithe disregard of the meaning of those deficits and that debt, a truly significant change in a politician who once ran against both.    A recent book by Paul Kennedy, whose abbreviated title is &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers,&quot; drives home one lesson with awesome repetition and numerous examples: The history of great powers is marked first by economic dynamism that takes them to the top, then decline caused by mounting military burdens that erode and then destroy the economic base that first created the power.    But this analysis is in the book stores in 1988. In 1956, President Eisenhower shared with a friend his concerns about the tendency of the military services to ask for more than they needed and the economy could sustain. He wrote in part:   &quot;Let us not forget that the Armed Services are to defend 'a way of life,' not merely land, property or lives . . . {and what is needed is} balance between the minimum requirements in costly implements of war and the health of our economy. . . . But someday there is going to be a man sitting in my present chair who has not been raised in the military services and who will have little understanding of where slashes in their estimates can be made with little or no damage. If that should happen while we still have the state of tension that now exists, I shudder to think of what could happen in this country.&quot;    Shudder no more. Ike, meet the Gipper.    ---   Mr. Carter is a political commentator who heads a television production firm. </TEXT></DOC>
