The CIA was even able to use the Palestinians to foilkidnappings and killing of Americans.   But over the past 10 years, U.S. intelligence capabilities inLebanon have eroded to the extent that the Central IntelligenceAgency cannot pinpoint the location of the eight American hostagesthat remain after the reported killing of Marine Lt. Col. WilliamHiggins.   The dearth of intelligence about the hostages and theirIranian-allied captors is partly the legacy of a string ofdisasters that has hounded CIA operations in Lebanon, and also theresult of the clannish nature and zealousness of the Shiite Moslemkidnappers, officials and experts say.   ``We don't have adequate information on where they live,operate, train,'' said Robert McFarlane, the former nationalsecurity adviser who helped plan the White House scheme to free thehostages by selling weapons to Iran in 1985-86.   Under ideal conditions, he said in an interview, the CIA wouldrecruit native Lebanese or Americans of Lebanese origin toinfiltrate the hostage-takers and report on their activities.   But Hezbollah, the umbrella group under whose auspices thecaptors operate, defies penetration, said Sen. David Boren,D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.   ``These little cells, these units, are like organized crimefamilies,'' Boren said in an interview. ``Strangers are easilyspotted, even if they're Lebanese,'' he added.   Marius Deeb, a Lebanese who taught political science at theAmerican University of Beirut for many years, thinks many Lebanesewould be willing to give information to the United States about thekidnappers.   ``But they're terrorized. They're scared. They have to know forsure that if they give information, their life will be protected,''Deeb said.   Such protection is impossible to guarantee in the chaos of acountry splintered by 14 years of civil war and foreign occupation.And the history of CIA operations in Lebanon has not beenreassuring.   Soon after the agency's Beirut station chief, William Buckley,was kidnapped outside his home in 1984, some of the CIA's Lebaneseagents were murdered or disappeared, according to David Martin andJohn Walcott, coauthors of ``Best Laid Plans.'' The book traces theadministration's attempts to fight terrorism in the Middle East.   U.S. officials believe Buckley revealed many secrets undertorture, possibly in Iran, before being killed. His body has notbeen recovered.   On April 18, 1983, a car bomb explosion demolished much of U.S.Embassy in Beirut, just as the CIA's chief Middle East analyst,Robert Ames, convened a staff meeting in his office.   Ames was one of 16 Americans killed, along with station chiefKenneth Haas. Martins and Walcott say the blast wiped out all buttwo of the agency's staff in Beirut.   David Ignatius, a Washington Post editor who has written afictionalized account of the secret U.S. channel to the PLO, citesIsrael's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and the forced exile of YasserArafat from Beirut as the turning point of the CIA's fortunes.   ``As Lebanon became more anarchic and new groups emerged withwhich we had no contact, the old board was broken and we neverreally learned to play on the new one,'' Ignatius said.   The CIA was dealt another blow last December when Matthew K.Gannon, an agency official who had been on temporary duty inBeirut, was killed on his way back in the explosion of Pan Amflight 103 over Scotland, believed to have been caused by aterrorist's bomb.   McFarlane and others familiar with intelligence operationssuggest the CIA's ability to operate in Lebanon was hampered by adecision 12 years ago by former agency chief Stansfield Turner toconcentrate more on technical intelligence gathering, throughsatellites and electronic interceptions.   The late CIA director William Casey ``faced great resistancewithin the agency and the intelligence community when he tried toexpand human collection'' of intelligence, McFarlane said.   Casey then turned outside the agency _ to former White Houseaide Oliver North _ in an effort to find out what had happened tothe American hostages in Lebanon and how they could be freed.North's dealings with Iran, including sales of U.S.-made missiles,brought about the release of two hostages in 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
