The Central Investigation Department of the Prosecutor General'sOffice questioned six senior officials of the Saemaul Undong ruraland urban development group and banned 26 people implicated in theinvestigation from leaving the country.   Prosecutor Kang Won-il said officials of the home, agricultureand fisheries, education and sports ministries along with SeoulCity government officials were being investigated to see if theyassisted fraud and corruption.   A major scandal arose after the government began a probe intoallegations that Saemaul and government officials embezzledmillions of dollars, sold government patronage and forcedbusinesses to make illegal donations over the past six years.   An initial investigation revealed evidence of fraud and othercrimes, including diversion of government and private subsidies andconcealment by government officials to protect Saemaul, prosecutionofficials said.   Interpol, the international police agency, had been asked tohelp track down and return top Saemaul official Kim Chin-taek whofled the country last month, Kang said.   ``My investigation team will unearth all malpractices and makepublic the results of the probe,'' Kang told reporters.   Chun Kyung-hwan, the younger brother of former President ChunDoo-hwan and former head of Saemaul, is one of the suspects underinvestigation. The younger Chun returned to South Korea on Sundayafter fleeing to Japan last week when knowledge of the probe becamepublic.   Prosecutors said they are investigating charges Saemaulofficials used ties with the government to enrich themselves andgovernment officials participated or covered up the corruption toprotect the administration.   While he was president, Chun named his brother to head Saemaul,but Chun is not being investigated in the scandal.   The Party for Peace and Democracy, the country's second-largestopposition party, today charged that President Roh aided Saemaulofficials involved in corruption when he was home minister in 1982.The party demanded that Roh be investigated by prosecutors and saidit would conduct its own probe.   The Blue House presidential office and prosecutors had noimmediate response to the party's allegations.   Former President Chun, who left office Feb. 25 at the end of aseven-year term, left Monday on a private visit to the UnitedStates during which he is to meet President Reagan and other topU.S. officials.   The younger Chun, a powerful figure while his brother was inoffice, resigned last year after being linked to gangsters whostaged a bloody underworld struggle for power. He indicated Mondaythere had been irregularities within Saemaul but gave no details.   Saemaul, a semi-private organization that worked closely withgovernment agencies, was formed in 1971 to improve urban and ruralliving standards. Projects ranged from building model communitiesto organizing city dwellers to keep streets clean.   Critics contend Saemaul, which has offices across the country,worked over the years with successive authoritarian governments bypromoting government interests and organizing support.   Roh, a former general who help put President Chun in power withmilitary backing in 1980, promised during election campaigns latelast year to probe any official corruption under Chun. Roh waselected on Dec. 16.   Political sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, say theRoh government started the Saemaul probe to discredit the formerpresident, who has tried to retain influence within the government.Several top Chun supporters were quietly dropped from the governingDemocratic Justice Party last week.   But some government officials and leaders of the DemocraticJustice Party are concerned the Saemaul probe could blacken thereputation of the Roh government because of its close ties to Chun.   The party also is worried the investigation could hurt itschances in National Assembly elections next month.</TEXT></DOC>
