The army said a 14-year-Palestinian died of a bullet wound inthe head sustained last week during clashes with troops in the WestBank town of Jenin, an army spokeswoman said.   In Jerusalem, police barred residents of the occupied West Bankand Gaza Strip from entering the Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's thirdholiest site.   The army launched an investigation Friday into the raid beforedawn Thursday at Nahalin in which at least five Palestinians werekilled, the national Itim news agency reported. It said twobrigidier generals were leading the inquiry.   In Geneva, the Red Cross said six Arabs were killed in the WestBank village near Bethlehem and accused Israeli paramilitary borderpolice of firing ``without discrimination and without restraint.''   The clash was one of the bloodiest in the 16-month Palestinianuprising, during which 430 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have beenkilled.   Maj. Gen. Meshulam Amit, commander of the border police, toldThe Associated Press the dimensions of the killings ``underscorethe need to thoroughly examine the incident.''   ``If there were irregularities or mistakes made by the borderpolicemen, the appropriate action will be taken,'' he said.   The border police have recently been given the prime role insearch-and-arrest raids and riot control, with the army working asbackup. The army commands border police in the occupied territories.   At least 11 refugee camps, towns or villages in the West Bankand occupied Gaza Strip had demonstrations or were shut down bygeneral strikes called to protest the slayings.   The worst confrontation was in the Askar refugee camp nearNablus. Arab doctors said 14 Palestinians there were hospitalizedwith gunshot wounds.   Doctors, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the woundedincluded 3-year-old Nesien Fayad, who was shot in the left side.   The army confirmed a report of two people wounded in Gaza andsaid it was checking further reports.   Police in Jerusalem took unprecedented measures to preventviolence at the Al Aqsa Mosque during Friday's Moslem prayers. Ariot occurred there during last week's prayers, and at least 2,000extra police were called in Friday to prevent similar violence.   The mosque is on the Temple Mount, known to Arabs as HaramSharif, or Noble Enclosure. The elevated platform also houses theDome of the Rock mosque and is lined on one side by the WesternWall, the last remnant of the second Jewish Temple. The site issacred to both Jews and Moslems.   Police reported only about 7,000 Moslems attended prayers at AlAqsa, far fewer than the 30,000 predicted. Apparently many werekept away by curfews on refugee camps and roadblocks outsideJerusalem.   In an unprecedented move, Israel closed a key gate leading tothe site, taking control of the gate away from the Moslemauthorities.   After Al Aqsa's Friday prayer services, 40 Palestinians gatheredoutside the mosque and began chanting ``With our blood and souls wewill redeem you, oh martyrs!''   They dispersed peacefully.   In the West Bank town of Hebron, five Palestinians were shot andwounded in stone-throwing clashes with troops, including threewounded in a confrontation after Moslem prayer services, Arabreporters said.   They said the worshipers shouted ``Allahu Akbar!'' or ``God isGreat!'' and threw rocks at border policemen as they left Hebron'sAl Sunieh Mosque.   In the Gaza Strip, three Palestinians were wounded in thevillage of Bani Suhaila in clashes that followed Friday prayers,hospital officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
