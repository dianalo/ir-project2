(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bob Dole was locked in a tight race withGeorge Bush Tuesday night in fractional returns from Vermont'sRepublican presidential primary, a low-key, low-stakes tuneup forSuper Tuesday. Michael Dukakis had an early advantage over JesseJackson in the Democratic race.   Sen. Dole was flush with endorsements in his effort to challengethe vice president in his New England backyard. Jackson, in thestate with the fewest blacks in the nation, hoped to finish astrong second to Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis as he did last weekendin Maine.   Gary Hart, the big winner here in 1984, was far, far back in thepack where he has been stuck all year.   The elections were ``beauty-contest'' primaries. Vermont'snational convention delegates won't be apportioned until next monthin party caucuses, and the candidates have practically ignored thestate to concentrate on the South. The primary took place on TownMeeting Day when Vermont's 328,466 voters decided town budgets,road repairs and a host of other local issues.   With just a handful of Vermont's 262 precincts reporting, Bushhad 288 and Dole 287. Pat Robertson, whose supporters said theywere focusing on the April caucuses, had 61 votes. Jack Kemp wasnot active in Vermont and had just 38 votes.   Among the Democrats, Dukakis had 336 votes and Jackson 198. Sen.Paul Simon, who made no real effort here, had 29 votes and Rep.Richard Gephardt _   who campaigned several times in the state _ had 28. Hart had 16votes and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. was not on the ballot.   Dukakis, governor of neighboring Massachusetts, boasted 15 paidstaffers and up to 60 volunteers in Vermont, while mostorganizations felt fortunate to have two or three paid staffers.But Jackson's Rainbow Coalition has been active in Vermont sincehis 1984 presidential campaign and prompted an uneasy mixture ofconcern and admiration from the Dukakis organization.   Jackson hoped to do well in Vermont to follow up a strongshowing last weekend in Maine and demonstrate he can win broadsupport from people of all races. ``The issue of another person'sskin, ought not to be an issue,'' said Chris Wood of the Jacksoncampaign.   Among the Republicans, Bush had the strongest organization, butDole was helped by heavyweight endorsements from Sen. RobertStafford, Rep. James Jeffords and former Gov. Richard Snelling.   Vermont's primary was overshadowed by next Tuesday's electionsin which 20 states will apportion hundreds of delegates. The onlything at stake in Vermont was news media attention, bragging rightsand the Bush-Dukakis regional winning streak. They both alreadyhave won the New Hampshire primary and the Maine caucuses and havehigh hopes next week in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.</TEXT><TEXT>      more</TEXT></DOC>
