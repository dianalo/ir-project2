Journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann shared a cell recently withAmerican Frank Herbert Reed who was ``mistreated to the point ofbeing left prostrate,'' Kauffmann's sister, Marie-Genevieve Dagin,was quoted as saying.   Reed was director of the Lebanese International School when hewas captured Sept. 9, 1986.   Mrs. Dagin's comments were reported by Agence France-Presse oneday after Kauffmann and two other Frenchmen arrived in Parisfollowing their release in Lebanon.   Kauffmann and the other Frenchmen, diplomats Marcel Carton andMarcel Fontaine, were released from Val-de-Grace military hospitalFriday after receiving medical examinations.   Kauffmann, in his own interview Friday with the French newsagency, said the remaining Western hostages in Lebanon were ``mymain concern. I ask their families to remain patient and stayconfident.'' He was also quoted as saying he read the novel ``Warand Peace'' 21 times during his captivity.   In a separate statement issued after the dispatch quoting hissister, Kauffmann said he intended to comment more about the otherhostages next week and did not want anyone relaying his impressionsuntil then.   A woman who answered Mrs. Dagin's telephone in Rennes on Fridaysaid she was out of town and could not be reached.   Mrs. Dagin was quoted by AFP as saying Kauffmann told her theAmerican hostages held by the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groupIslamic Jihad were ``the object of brutality because they tried toescape.''   There are 18 foreigners missing in Lebanon, including nineAmericans. The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was capturedMarch 16, 1985.   The AFP dispatch did not make clear if Kauffmann specified whichhostages were mistreated for attempting to get away.   French officials, meanwhile, defended the circumstances underwhich the hostages were released. Premier Jacques Chirac condemnedthose who ``try to insinuate'' that France made a deal with Iran.   ``I say solemnly, I say on my honor, that no negotiation, nocompromise, no bargaining, no deal took place with any foreigngovernment, or even less with any terrorist group,'' he said.   Agence France-Presse, citing unidentified sources it said wereclose to French negotiators, said France and Iran agreed to resumeformal diplomatic relations under a 40-day schedule beginning theday the hostages were freed.   France also has confirmed reports that one-third of a $1 billionloan Iran made to France in 1974 has been paid. Other reports havesaid the remainder is to be paid in return for freeing Kauffmann,Carton and Fontaine.   The widow of French hostage Michel Seurat said Friday she wantedan official inquiry into her husband's death. Seurat was kidnappedwith Kauffmann in May 1985 and died in captivity.   Mary Seurat said Chirac also should demand Seurat's body bereturned to France.   ``I want his remains so I can bury them, in a country where evendogs can have gravestones,'' she said.   In her interview, Mrs. Dagin was quoted as saying that shelearned from her brother that Fontaine was briefly held with TerryWaite, the special envoy of the archbishop of Canterbury. Waitedisappeared Jan. 20, 1987, while on a mission in Lebanon seekingthe hostages' release.   She said her brother ``found no excuse for his kidnappers, forwhom he feels only hate.''   The agency quoted her as saying Kauffmann considered using aprivate signal to his son Gregoire _ wiggling his nose _ toindicate he was lying when making videotapes under coercion inwhich he appealed to the French government to do more to win hisfreedom.   He decided not to make the sign ``because he feared theconsequences if it were discovered,'' she quoted im as saying.   Kauffmann was quoted as saying some of his captors treated himhumanely, but one ``never let up with the humiliations, not tomention a simulated execution in June 1987 that was particularlytrying.''   ``When I felt discouraged, I prayed and the next day some littlesigns would let me climb back up again,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
