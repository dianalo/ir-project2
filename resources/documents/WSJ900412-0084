The results were marred by a jump in bad loans and inforeclosed real estate and were below Wall Street estimates.They touched off an early mild decline in Security Pacific'sstock, which already had been trading at depressed levelsrelative to its earnings, and highlighted the challenge facedby the company's new chief executive officer, Robert Smith,as he attempts to boost earnings and market value, both ofwhich are believed to be crucial to his long-term strategyfor the bank.</LP><TEXT>   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, SecurityPacific closed at $35.875, unchanged. The quarterly resultsindicate a price-to-earnings multiple of about 6; J.P. Morganandamp; Co.'s multiple, by comparison, is about 8.   In the year-earlier period, Security Pacific earned $179.3million, also $1.54 a share. The company had 116.5 millionshares outstanding in the latest quarter, up from 112.7million a year earlier.   Most analysts had projected per-share earnings for theperiod of between $1.60 and $1.65. But Security Pacific'snonperforming loans edged up to $1.7 billion from $1.6billion a year earlier, mainly because of troubled loans inAustralia and the United Kingdom. Its level of repossessedreal estate jumped 72%, to $542 million from $315 million ayear ago. Net credit losses, excluding developing-countrydebt, totaled $113.9 million, 22% above a year-earlier $93.6million. The company's reserve for credit losses stood at$1.2 billion at March 31, roughly the same as last year'sreserve.   The company also said its net interest margin -- thedifference between what it pays for funds and receives on itsloans -- slipped to 3.95% from a year-earlier 4.21%.   John Kooken, vice chairman and chief financial officer,said that $40 million of the credit losses came from thedevastated Arizona real estate market. Security Pacific had aloss of $176 million in its Arizona operations last year, butdespite the continuing bleeding in the first quarter, Mr.Kooken said the bank still expects its Arizona losses for allof 1990 to be &quot;substantially below&quot; 1989's levels.   He also said that the swollen repossessed propertyportfolio reflected problems in California and overseas, aswell as in Arizona. But he said the bank foresees no imminentswoon in California real estate; such a development is muchfeared in the banking industry because many lenders haveheavy exposure there and because California's lengthy realestate boom has left it one of the few healthy markets in thecountry.</TEXT></DOC>
