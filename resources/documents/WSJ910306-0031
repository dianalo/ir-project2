Adm. Mike McConnell, director of intelligence for theJoint Chiefs of Staff, said that with a mechanized brigadeand an armored brigade of Iraq's Republican Guard beingdeployed south, the military &quot;probably will be successful inputting this down because of the lack of organization andleadership&quot; on the part of the insurgents.</LP><TEXT>   But Adm. McConnell said that, in the long run, SaddamHussein &quot;may be sowing the seeds of his own destruction&quot; andthat it would be difficult for the Iraqi leader to maintaincontrol in his nation.   The Iraqi president also is using regular army troops,militia and police units to quell the current unrest and &quot;mayhave restored government control in a few of the affectedareas,&quot; Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman,said.   Still, a senior administration official said that at thesame time the army appears to take control in some areas,unrest &quot;pops up somewhere else.&quot;   There also is ferment in northern Iraq, where Kurdishnationalists have long agitated for a state of their own inKurdish-speaking areas now divided among Iraq, Iran andTurkey. Turkey has signaled that it would be alarmed by anyrise of Kurdish nationalism growing out of the war with Iraqand implied that it might move to head it off. But U.S.officials said they are confident that neither Turkey in thenorth nor Iran in the south had plans to stake claims onKurdish or Shiite areas of Iraq. One problem U.S. analystsare having, the senior official said, is determining whichside is being taken by the remnants of the defeated armyunits that occupied Kuwait.   Officials said there aren't any reports of fighting inBaghdad. Ms. Tutwiler said, however, that both Radio Baghdadand the Iraqi News Agency went off the air for unexplainedreasons for about an hour yesterday.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney made clear that the U.S. hasno intention of getting involved in the conflict. &quot;I think itwould be very difficult for us to hold the coalition togetherfor any particular course of action dealing with internalIraqi politics,&quot; Mr. Cheney told a business group here. &quot;Idon't think, at this point, that our writ extends to tryingto move inside Iraq and deal with their internal problems.&quot;   Nevertheless, the prospect of a Shiite uprising -- evokingmemories of Iran's Islamic revolution a decade ago --probably is making the U.S. and its Arab allies, such asSaudi Arabia, uneasy. &quot;They don't want to see Iraqdismembered and perpetually unstable,&quot; said Kenneth Katzman,a former U.S. intelligence analyst on the Mideast.   Many of the Shiite leaders in the past have had closelinks to religious leaders in neighboring Iran. U.S.officials, however, continued to insist that &quot;there is nodirect evidence to link the Iranians to this particularsituation.&quot;   Still, Iran's public tone toward Saddam Hussein's regimehas become &quot;quite a bit more hostile&quot; in recent days, onesenior U.S. official said. The turmoil creates a delicateproblem in the U.S. attitude toward Iran. The U.S. is nervousat the prospect that Iran might step into a power vacuum inIraq and create a government to its own liking, therebyincreasing its stature and clout in the Persian Gulf area.But the administration also sees an opportunity to work withIran in the environment created by the war. U.S. officialssay they envision a role by Iran in the postwar regionalsecurity system the U.S. plans to help construct.   In Iran's first public reaction to the turmoil, IranianPresident Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani expressed concern andurged the U.S.-led forces occupying southern Iraq to leaveand let nations in the region solve their own problems,Reuters reported.   Separately, Reuters said that Iraqi Deputy Prime MinisterSaadoun Hammadi made a surprise trip to Tehran with a messagefrom Saddam Hussein for Mr. Rafsanjani. The Iranian presidentis considered a pragmatist who is more interested in openingrelations to the West than championing the cause of anIslamic revolution.   &quot;We simply do not know&quot; what role Iran is playing in thedisturbances, Secretary of State James Baker conceded.   Iraq said it fulfilled its pledge to release all 35 alliedprisoners of war, but bad weather delayed their return home.Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the second batch ofPOWs, which includes 15 Americans, will be flown from Baghdadtoday after an allied transport carries 294 Iraqi POWs home.He said poor weather had delayed the exchange, which had beenscheduled for yesterday. U.S. officials said there was noreason to doubt Iraq claims that it held no more prisoners.   Iraq also said it annulled its annexation of Kuwait incompliance with United Nations demands, the official IraqiNews Agency said. Kuwait's U.N. representative, however,rejected Iraq's renunciation of the annexation, contending ithad to be rescinded by the National Assembly, which declaredKuwait was part of Iraq a few days after last August'sinvasion.   In addition, the Iraqi News Agency reported that TariqAziz, Iraq's foreign minister, said Baghdad agreed to returnthe assets taken from Kuwait.</TEXT></DOC>
