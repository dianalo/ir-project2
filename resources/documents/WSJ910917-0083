But V.V.Garashchenko, chairman of Gosbank, the State Bank of theU.S.S.R., said he couldn't rule it out.   He told a London meeting of the Vienna Council he wassympathetic to their concerns but had limited capacity toinsulate the Kremlin's financial affairs from the powerfulindependence movements.   Western lenders have been badly shaken by proposals thatMoscow's debts be reapportioned among the independentrepublics, along with gold, diamonds and energy supplies.   A Soviet financial break-up could saddle the financialcommunity with unprecedented complications, such as having todeal with each republic in search of repayment. Equallyworrisome is the possibility that the republics' centralbanks will set out separate monetary policies and issueseparate currencies.                                                                                                          NEW ZEALAND TO CUT TARIFFS                                                                                                          Wellington said it would reduce by one-third the tariffson imports of manufactured goods between 1993 and 1996. NewZealand will decide on subsequent cuts in 1994. PrimeMinister Jim Bolger said the initial reductions represent a&quot;moderate, common-sense, middle-of-the-road approach&quot; tocushion industry and jobs. Domestic firms sought slow removalof tariff protections, but the Finance Ministry wanted a morerapid elimination.                                                                                                          CHINA TO OPEN SECURITIES MARKETS                                                                                                          Chinese securities markets will be opened to foreigninvestors by next year, under a plan Beijing approved inprinciple, a Shanghai Securities Exchange official said.Special Class B shares denominated in yuan will be issued forsale to foreign nationals and securities firms for hardcurrency. In the past decade, Beijing has let foreigners setup businesses or invest in joint ventures with Chinesepartners, but barred them from buying shares in Chinesecompanies.                                                                                                          COMPROMISE ON AFRICA'S ECONOMY                                                                                                          After a deadlock over debt forgiveness and other problems,wealthy nations vowed at the United Nations to help reduceAfrica's $270 billion in debts and pledged more foreign aidbut declined to set targets. The compromise report hasgeneral recommendations on how Africa can help itself and howindustrialized nations can help halt Africa's economic slide.&quot;The international community, in support of Africa's economicreform efforts, undertakes to seek to find durable solutionsto the African debt crisis,&quot; such as a technical aid fund toease dependence on commodities, the report said.                                                                                                          VIETNAM'S RICE DENATIONALIZATION   Of more than 100 rice mills that Vietnam nationalized in1975 in the southern province of Hau Giang, 72 have beenreturned to their former owners, the Vietnam News Agencysaid. &quot;The former owners or their relatives immediatelyinvested in repairing the mills and buying new equipment,&quot;the report said. After a decade of rigid socialism, theCommunist Party in late 1986 began nationwide reformsallowing a private sector role.                                                                                                          ARGENTINES PROTEST CUTBACKS                                                                                                          Thousands of employees at Argentine state banks, oilrefineries and a steel mill staged work stoppages to protestprivatization plans that threaten their jobs. The government,which is scaling back public employment and the role of thestate in Argentina's economy, said it wouldn't give in.Argentina seeks to reduce the deficit that has spawnedtriple-digit annual inflation for nearly 20 years.                                                                                                          U.S. FIRMS URGE EC TIMETABLE                                                                                                          U.S. businesses urged the European Community to fix atimetable for its proposed move to a single currency andcentral bank. Talks on the issues are snagged over timing andpowers.   The American Chamber of Commerce in Belgium, which lobbiesfor U.S. companies in Europe, said setting and meeting aneconomic and monetary union deadline is essential forbusiness support. It also urged EC member states to examinethe effect of a single currency on business.   Stability of the European currency unit and its acceptanceas legal tender in all EC states are needed to buildconfidence among the business community, the group said,adding that it supports the &quot;early creation&quot; of a Europeancentral bank as a supervisory body.   Separately in Brussels, the EC Commission's topcompetition official said the commission would get tough withcompanies that breach EC competition rules and impose finesof as much as 10% of a firm's annual sales.
