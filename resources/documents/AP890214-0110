An estimated 600 Cuban soldiers and 4,500 Angolan governmenttroops are attempting to capture rebel-held positions insouth-central Angola near the border with Namibia, said officials ofSavimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.   ``The Angolans and the Cubans are trying to take the border postsby force, but they will not do so,'' Savimbi said in an interview athis bush headquarters in southeastern Angola.   Cuba last month began a phased withdrawal of its 50,000 soldierssupporting Angola's Marxist government in a 13-year-old war againstrightist rebels.   Cuba, Angola and South Africa signed a peace agreement in NewYork in December calling for Cuba to withdraw all 50,000 troops byJuly 1991. A total 3,000 troops are to leave by April 1, and allremaining soldiers are to be moved at least 180 miles north of theNamibian border by Aug. 1.   South Africa has agreed to stop providing military assistance tothe rebels and is to grant independence this year to Namibia, alsoknown as South-West Africa.   Savimbi and his insurgents were not involved in the peace talks,and they have vowed to continue fighting to wrest a power-sharingagreement with the government.   Savimbi said he received substantial stockpiles of weapons,gasoline and other military essentials before South Africa stoppedsupplying aid.   ``South Africa is gone, we are standing on our own, and we aregoing to survive,'' said Savimbi.   He refused to disclose the extent of his armory, but unconfirmedreports say he has supplies to last two years. The United Statessupports Savimbi, and President Bush has pledged to continue aid,estimated at $15 million last year.   The rebel leader denied an Angolan government claim that SouthAfrican forces entered southeastern Angola last week in defense ofthe rebels. Pretoria has denied the charge, which it says places``the spirit of the Cuban troop withdrawal process in jeopardy.''   Savimbi said his movement's diplomatic position has improvedsince the guerrilla movement formally cut ties with South Africa.   He said several African leaders, including President FelixHouphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast, are attempting to arrange areconciliation between the Angolan government and rebels.   Savimbi said he canceled an offensive begun last week so as notto jeopardize Houphouet-Boigny's efforts.   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and his governmentrefuse to negotiate with the rebels, although Savimbi says theadversaries maintain low-level contacts in Europe.   The rebel movement traditionally launches offensives in theJanuary-April rainy season, when the bush gives them more cover.Government troops usually make a major push during the dry seasonlater in the year.   But Wambu Chindondo, the rebel intelligence chief, said thecombined Angolan-Cuban forces began an offensive Feb. 2 aimed atrebel strongholds near the southern towns of Caiundo and Ongiva.   Chindondo said a force of 4,000 rebels armed with heavy artilleryand anti-aircraft weapons has withstood the charge.   He claimed the guerrillas have killed 275 government troops andeight Cubans and have lost 17 men in fighting in that area.   Chindondo said the rebels remain active throughout the countryand last week temporarily cut electricity to the capital, Luanda,when they blew up six electricity pylons.   The rebels have suffered no major setbacks in recent weeks, hesaid, noting the Angolan govenment has not claimed any big victories.</TEXT></DOC>
