Corn in &quot;The Winged Gospel.&quot;                                                                                                          That bit of anticipatory doggerel was written in 1926,when Ford Motor Co. was hard at work on an airbornecounterpart to the Model T, a &quot;flying flivver&quot; that wouldmake private aviation safe and affordable for everyone.Though the Ford project crashed, the dream persisted to adegree that is almost unimaginable in an age when thegreatest pleasure in flying for many people is thehoney-roasted peanuts. By 1945, you could buy an airplane atMacy's.   Today, what stands between the dream and oblivion ismostly Paul Poberezny, the unlettered son of an immigrantUkrainian laborer. He is the founder, chairman and spiritualleader of the Experimental Aircraft Association, a groupthat, much to its surprise, has inherited an entire sector ofAmerican industry.   The business of making small airplanes is all but dead inthis country, wiped out mainly by product-liability lawsuits.And in a strange historical turnabout, small-planemanufacturing has reverted to the barns and garages whence itemerged in the 1920s. The next time you see a light aircraftpass overhead, know that it is most likely either obsolescentor a homemade flying machine assembled by one of Mr.Poberezny's 130,000 disciples.   Cessna Aircraft Co., which once dominated the marketworld-wide, stopped making small planes in 1986. PiperAircraft Corp. has been operating under Chapter 11bankruptcy-court protection since July; it recently agreed tosell most of its assets to a group that plans to make Pipersin Canada, interposing a border between the company and theU.S. courts. All the U.S. manufacturers combined shipped only608 single-engine, piston-powered airplanes last year, downfrom 14,398 in 1978, the industry's best year in moderntimes. Training airplanes are no longer built by the majormanufacturers at all.   But as the industry has been litigated into the ground,members of Mr. Poberezny's group have exploited a quirk infederal aviation regulations to assemble a vast and curiousnetwork, fitting together airplanes that are cheaper, fasterand more efficient than what's available commercially. Thequirk is a rule dating from 1949 that makes it legal to flyan airplane that hasn't been certified by the FederalAviation Administration, as long as you don't use it forcommercial purposes -- and as long as you build 51% of ityourself. Last year, shipments of airplane kits for homebuilders exceeded shipments of whole small airplanes by atleast two to one.   The Experimental Aircraft Association's name may call tomind a Quonset hut in a wheat field, but its headquarters isactually an $18 million complex in Oshkosh, Wis. The annualconvention there is now one of the largest air shows in theworld. When NASA comes up with something that will make smallplanes safer these days -- a spin-resistant design, say, orlightning-protection technology -- it takes it directly toOshkosh, says Joseph Stickle, the chief engineer at the spaceagency's Langley Research Center. &quot;My own feeling is thathome builders are going to keep that segment of aviationalive,&quot; he says.   The homemade planes are substantial aircraft, not spindlyultralights. Most of them can fly circles around agarden-variety Piper, many are made of advanced composites,and some incorporate airfoils the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration developed. A few are genuine feats ofshade-tree engineering, like the rakish two-seater that JohnStoltzfus had on display at a recent Experimental AircraftAssociation &quot;fly-in&quot; at the New Castle County Airport inWilmington, Del. Mr. Stoltzfus built his plane from scratch,for around $12,000, out of fiberglass and balsa wood. Fittedwith a Subaru automobile engine, a reduction gear from agyrocopter and a carburetor from an old MG, it will cruise at160 miles per hour, he says.   And what moved him to build it?   &quot;I was tired of my job.&quot;   And what sort of job was that?   &quot;Body and fender work.&quot;   For a quick test flight, let us sidle across the tarmac toJeffrey Harden, who spent two years and $46,000 building atwo-seat Lancair 320 from a pre-molded kit. High above theairfield, sunlight flooding the neatly carpeted cockpit, hetips his epoxy-composite airplane into a dive and muttershappily, &quot;Now we're moving.&quot; The air-speed indicator climbspast 220, to 250, to 270 miles per hour -- about twice thevelocity of a two-seat Cessna. &quot;Ordinary airplanes are niceand they're fun but the designs are 20, 25 years old,&quot; Mr.Harden says. &quot;None of them are very economical, and theperformance just isn't there.&quot;   There are now 13,647 home-built airplanes registered withthe FAA, and at least that many are estimated to be underconstruction. They are a wild bestiary of designs: tandembiplanes with pusher engines; ancient-looking high-wingmonoplanes; canard-wing seaplanes; replicas of fighters fromboth world wars; planes with forward-swept wings for bettervisibility; planes with wings that fold up so you can storethem in a garage. One kit manufacturer is working on ahomemade supersonic jet.   All this activity is not a spontaneous efflorescence ofbackyard technical creativity; it is the product of bitterfrustration as much as anything. Burt Rutan, designer of thecircumnavigating Voyager aircraft, speaks for many Americanaviators when he says: &quot;The best technologies to revitalizegeneral aviation in this country would be those thatfacilitate the jailing of attorneys.&quot;   The small-plane makers have had a bad decade for severalreasons, including high fuel costs, overproduction andrecession. But what is happening now, according topractically every constituency except the lawyers, is a clearcase of products-liability law eating a sick industry alive.   The legal doctrine of strict liability is supposed toimprove the general welfare by allowing injury victims tocollect damages without having to prove negligence by amanufacturer. The idea is that this will induce manufacturersto produce things that are as safe as they can be,&quot;internalizing&quot; the cost of injury prevention; and that itwill induce manufacturers to buy enough insurance to coverinjury victims' claims, building that insurance premium intothe cost of their product.   Applying this doctrine to small planes, which sometimessmash into the ground in huge lethal fireballs, turns out tobe problematic. The rate of deaths per hours flown hasdecreased steadily for decades. Yet the paid claims forjudgments, settlements and defense for general-aviationmanufacturers jumped from $24 million to $210 million between1977 and 1985, according to the General AviationManufacturers Association. Small-plane crashes -- involvingcomplicated machinery, emotional drama and relatively wealthyvictims -- simply are too juicy for some lawyers to pass up.   Furthermore, if an airplane is to be airworthy at all itmust be built to last a long time; the average age of thegeneral aviation fleet is now over 24 years. Because there isno time limit on product liability, manufacturers can be heldliable for accidents in planes whose maintenance and generaltreatment have been out of their control for decades.Insurance for this &quot;liability tail&quot; must be built into thecost of each new airplane, and the manufacturers say this ispricing their products out of the market, in addition toscaring away lenders and investors.   &quot;We finally just decided that there was no way we couldproduce an airplane at a profit and at a price that ourcustomers would want to pay,&quot; says a spokesman for Cessna, aGeneral Dynamics Corp. unit, which reserves about $25 milliona year for product liability. The company, which once usedthe motto &quot;We Teach the World to Fly,&quot; has said it would makea decision about re-entering the small-plane business within24 hours of enactment of some kind of tort reform.   &quot;You can't amortize the risk,&quot; says E. Glenn Parr, Piper'sgeneral counsel. &quot;We have a $200 million backlog of orders.If it weren't for the liability tail, lending institutionswould be lined up to lend us money.&quot;   If the bankruptcy court assents, Piper will sell its majorassets next month to Cyrus Eaton Group International Ltd., aclosely held international trading company based inCleveland. Cyrus Eaton Jr., the company's chairman, says itwill re-establish Piper somewhere in Canada -- where lawyersdon't generally collect contingency fees, where punitivedamages are limited and where losing plaintiffs may berequired to pay defendants' legal costs. The relocation, hesays, is intended &quot;explicitly to avoid the liabilityproblem.&quot;   George L. Priest, a Yale Law School professor who hasstudied general aviation's predicament, suggests that it mayconstitute an indictment of the overall doctrine of strictliability. &quot;It's pretty dramatic evidence of how littleeffect the expansion of liability has had on safety, and howdramatic the effect on the industry has been,&quot; he says.   The American Trial Lawyers Association, which representsplaintiffs' attorneys, denies that there is a problem in thetort system and blames the industry's difficulties on badmanagement.   All this is particularly bewildering to Paul Poberezny,who at age 67 is old enough to remember when farmers con-sidered it an honor to have airplanes crash-land in theirfields. &quot;We'd have a forced landing and knock down somealfalfa,&quot; he says, &quot;and they'd say, `Stay for supper, tie herdown, no problem.' Society has changed.&quot;   It is not just society that has changed, but the place ofaviation in the national imagination. Eight years before Mr.Poberezny was born, flying was such a rich man's novelty thata trade publication saw fit to announce that &quot;William EarlDodge, brother-in-law of John McCullough, will take upaero-yachting at Newport this season.&quot; But by the time Mr.Poberezny was nine years old, author Gore Vidal's father, whowas a Commerce Department official, was leading a federaldrive to get manufacturers to build a $700 &quot;poor man'sairplane.&quot; When Mr. Poberezny was 22, the era of &quot;an airplanein every garage&quot; was so generally presumed to be imminentthat the makers of Wheaties gave away an airplane in apromotional contest, according to Mr. Corn's aviationhistory.   Mr. Poberezny himself became obsessed with flight as adirt-poor Kansas boy (&quot;we ripped up catalogs for toiletpaper,&quot; he recalls) and started out by rebuilding a wreckedglider given to him by his ancient-history teacher. Hestarted the Experimental Aircraft Association in his basementin 1953, with 32 people attending the first meeting. &quot;I wasasked to be president, but I didn't know how to say thealphabet,&quot; he says. That didn't seem to be much of anobstacle at the time, because he didn't expect to end uppublishing five magazines, meeting regularly with the U.S.Secretary of Transportation, lobbying the FAA and generally,as he says, &quot;trying to put general aviation back on itsfeet.&quot;   But he has played the role of rumpled patriarcheffectively, raising funds for an aviation museum and afoundation, establishing a network of technical consultants,preaching a creed of craftsmanship and turning Oshkosh intoan aviator's Mecca. &quot;We call him Dad,&quot; says Stephen Teager,an FAA flight-test engineer who has never met Mr. Poberezny.Roy Lopresti, a veteran airplane designer, says, &quot;A millionpeople go through there {at the annual air show}, and younever see a scrap of paper or a cigarette on the ground. It'slike a religious event. My kids have grown up going toOshkosh, and to this day, if they've done something wrong,they say, `What would Paul Poberezny say?' &quot;   As extraordinary as this grass-roots industry is, nobodymistakes it for a longterm solution. The FAA's 51% ruleprohibits builders from assembling kits and reselling them(although rumors circulate of clandestine kit-buildingfactories in the Northwest). An industry-backed bill to giveairplane manufacturers a degree of protection from lawsuitshas been introduced in each of the last three Congresses;each time it has stalled in committee.   &quot;Many people would say that unless we can do somethingabout liability, there is a good chance that this industrymay just go away in this country,&quot; says Frederick Sontag,chairman of the General Aircraft Manufacturers Association.   But the future of personal aviation looks entirelydifferent to Paul Moller, a former professor of aeronauticalengineering at the University of California at Davis. He hasspent 25 years and about $30 million developing his &quot;skycar,&quot; a computer-controlled, eight-engine vehicle designed totravel on roads, take off and land vertically, carry fourpeople through the air at 350 miles per hour and sell, oncemass production begins, for not much more money than anautomobile. The prototype still needs a little work, buteventually, Mr. Moller says, &quot;I don't think there's anyquestion that this is something that everyone will use.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
