Solvent extraction systems based on chlorine-freesolvents have been shown to be optimal for the determination of molybdenum.Careful optimization of temperature-time parameters of the ashing stageis necessary in the analysis of extracts containing volatile molybdenumchelates and of extracts based on chloroform and carbon tetrachloride.Modification of the furnace surface with lanthanum carbides allows toreduce the negative effect of the organic solvent and extracted complexcomposition.</TEXT></DOC>
