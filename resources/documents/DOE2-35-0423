For 86 air samples taken, respirablecrystalline silica personal exposures averaged 0.12 mg/cu m (NIOSH RecommendedExposure Limit (REL) for respirable crystalline silica, 0.05 mg/cu m);38 of the samples exceeded the REL. All samples from the slip housesexceeded the NIOSH REL. The 18 samples taken in the casting area indicatedthat the average exposure limit was 0.06 mg/cu m, with eight samplesexceeding the NIOSH REL. In the dry-finishing area 18 samples showedan average respirable silica concentration of 0.11 mg/cu m. Exposureto talc averaged 2.7 mg/cu m in the casting areas for 38 samples. Symptomsof chronic cough were noted in 20%, chronic bronchitis in 5%, and shortnessof breath in 31% of the workers. Of 196 chest x-rays examined, 18 exhibitedevidence of asbestos or talc exposure; five had symptoms of silicosis.The authors conclude that there is a serious, extensive problem regardingexposures to respirable silica and respirable talc dust.</TEXT></DOC>
