The official Xinhua News Agency said the seven people executed inBeijing today were convicted of setting army trucks on fire,stealing army goods or assaulting soldiers when the military invadedthe capital on June 3-4.   The executions were carried out despite international pleas forclemency.   They came a day after three men were executed in Shanghai forsetting fire to a train June 6 after it ran through a barricade,striking and killing six protesters.   Also Wednesday, 17 people were executed in the northeasternprovincial city of Jinan, a reporter for a local newspaper said bytelephone.   Xinhua gave no details of today's executions other than to say acourt had rejected appeals of the seven, who were convicted Saturdayand included workers but not students.   Most executions in China are with a bullet to the back of thehead.   The Shanghai executions were the first announced for crimesallegedly committed during nationwide protests after the army killedhundreds of unarmed civilians in Beijing in June 4.   None of the 27 people reported executed have been identified asstudents, who inspired the pro-democracy movement.   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua said today it was``futile'' for foreign countries to try to exert pressure on China.She said suppression of the nationwide ``rebellion'' was an internalaffair and other nations should not interfere.   She also urged the more than 20 Chinese diplomats who havedefected abroad to return home, saying they were led astray bymisinformation.   Foreign leaders have urged China to be lenient with peoplearrested for roles in the pro-democracy movement and for taking partin protests once the crackdown began.   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III, referring to theexecution of the three workers in Shanghai on Wednesday, said, ``Wedeeply regret the fact that these executions have gone forward.''   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain said she was``utterly appalled'' by the executions while Australian PrimeMinister Bob Hawke called the death sentences ``intolerable.''   New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange said today that hiscountry would lodge a formal diplomatic complaint to demonstrate its``revulsion'' at the executions.   In Japan, the Kyodo News Service quoted Prime Minister SousukeUno as saying, ``That this kind of thing should happen amid risinginternational criticism is extremely regrettable.''   Premier Li Peng on Wednesday said countries that try to exertdiplomatic and economic pressures on China, the world's mostpopulous country, are ``short-sighted and unwise.''   The Foreign Ministry's Li said China hopes to maintain goodrelations with the United States but, ``We firmly oppose theAmerican government interfering in China's internal affairs andexerting pressure on China.''   Washington has curtailed military sales and contacts andsuspended high-level meetings to protest the harsh suppression ofdissent.   The 17 people executed in Jinan on Wednesday had been sentencedthe day before at a public rally, the reporter for the Jinan Dailysaid. The reporter, who declined to be identified, said the 17 werecommon criminals _ not participants in the student-led movement fordemocracy.   However, a local radio broadcast said Wednesday that the 17 wereamong 45 people put on trial for taking part in disturbances inShandong province.   Most major Chinese cities were wracked by demonstrations andriots after the military assault in Beijing, which ran out ofcentral Tiananmen Square students who had for seven weeks agitatedfor a freer China.   More than 1,600 people, including student and labor activists,have been arrested since the government crushed the pro-democracymovement and began a campaign against dissent. The propagandabarrage has included calls for people to inform on friends andrelatives.   Official media today announced the arrest of 13 ``spies''allegedly working for the rival government in Taiwan to fomentunrest during the student democracy movement.   They identified one as Ou Zongyou, a Chinese man arrested inGuiyang, southern China, said to have spread rumors, slandered theruling Communist Party, collected banned publications and takenpictures of anti-state demonstrations during the``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''   The other 12 alleged spies included three from Beijing, five fromShanghai, two from Canton, one from Shenyang and one from Ningxia.   The reports said they had been recruited by Taiwan militaryintelligence or local agents to infiltrate the pro-democracymovement. Television tape showed several of them joiningdemonstrations and chanting along with the crowds in TiananmenSquare before the military recaptured it.   China's official press also reported 37 more people had turnedthemselves in in Shanghai, bringing to 102 the number of Shanghairesidents who had surrendered to police. They included some leadersof the independent student and citizens' groups that sprung upduring the protests.   The Supreme Court has told local courts those who turn themselvesin and confess their wrongdoings should be given lenient treatment,while those who resist arrest should be punished severely.   Beijing radio said Zhou Chifeng, a student who helped organizethe ill-fated three-week student sit-in at Tiananmen Square wasarrested in the northeastern city of Changchun.</TEXT></DOC>
