The assessment provides a basisfor the conclusion that the field testing of these genetically engineeredtomato plants does not present a risk of introduction or disseminationof a plant pest and also will not have any significant impact on the qualityof the human environment.

The rule regulates the introduction (importation, interstatemovement, and release into the environment) of genetically engineered organismsand products that are plant pests or that there is reason to believe areplant pests (regulated articles). A permit must be obtained before a regulatedarticle can be introduced in the United States. The rule sets forth proceduresfor obtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movementof a regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release intothe environment of a regulated article. APHIS has stated that it wouldprepare an environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmentalimpact statement before issuing a permit for the release into the environmentof a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).Calgene, Inc., of Davis, California, has submitted an application for apermit for release into the environment, for the field testing of geneticallyengineered tomato plants modified to contain an extra gene to reduce endopolygalacturonaseproduction. One function that the enzyme endopoloygalacturonase performsis to enable tomato fruits to soften during the ripening process.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the tomato plants under the conditionsdescribed in the Calgene, Inc., application. APHIS concluded that the fieldtesting will not present a risk of plant pest introduction or disseminationand will not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by Calgene, Inc., as well as a review of otherrelevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' reviewand analysis of the environmental impacts associated with conducting thefield testing.The facts supporting APHIS's finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. An endopolygalacturonase gene from tomato has been modified and insertedinto a tomato chromosome in such a way as to produce anti-sense RNA, forthe purpose of reducing endopolygalacturonase production in order to delayripening of the tomato fruit. In nature, the genetic material containedin a plant chromosome can only be transferred to another plant by cross-pollinationwith a sexually compatible plant. In this field test, none of the introducedgenes can spread to sexually compatible plants outside the field test plotbecause the field test plot is located sufficiently far from any sexuallycompatible plant.2. Neither the modified endopolygalacturonase gene nor the derived anti-senseRNA confers on tomato any plant pest characteristics. The tomato cultivar(UC82B) from which the endopolygalacturonase gene was obtained is not aplant pest.3. The anti-sense endopolygalacturonase gene does not provide the transformedtomato plants with any measurable selective advantage over nontransformedtomato plants in the transformed plants' ability to be disseminated orto become established in the environment.4. The vector used to transfer the anti-sense endopolygalacturonase geneto tomato plants has been evaluated for its use in this experiment, anddoes not pose a plant pest risk in this experiment. The vector, althoughderived from a plasmid with known plant pathogenic potential, has beendisarmed; that is, genes that are necessary to confer plant pathogenictraits have been removed from the vector. The vector has been tested andshown to be not pathogenic to any susceptible plant.5. The vector agent, the phytopathogenic bacterium that was used to deliverthe anti-sense endopolygalacturonase gene into a tomato plant cell, waseliminated and is no longer associated with the transformed tomato plants.6. Horizontal movement of genetic material after insertion into a plantgenome (i.e., chromosomal DNA) has not been demonstrated. The vector actsby delivering and inserting the gene into the tomato genome. The vectordoes not survive in or on a transformed plant. No mechanism in nature tohorizontally move an inserted gene from the chromosome of a transformedplant to any other organism has been reported in the scientific literature.7. The size of the field test plot is small (110 feet by 192 feet). Theplot will be located within a 10-acre cotton field on a private farm withrestricted access.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with; (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384 and 44 FR 51272-51274).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 28th day of December, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James Glosser,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="34">December 28, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-30220 Filed 12-30-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3410-34-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
