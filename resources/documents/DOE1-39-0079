Peripherallymphocytes, from six individuals, were exposed to X or gamma rays invitro, and dose-survival curves were obtained. The results showed typicalsigmoid curves similar to those observed when other mammalian cells areexposed to radiation. The D/sub 10/ (dose required to kill 90 % of thecells) was found to be 3.0 to 3.5 Gy.</TEXT></DOC>
