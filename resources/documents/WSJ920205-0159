Mr. Karadi, 32 years old, is a commander in the Israeliborder police, a special force originally set up to protectthe country's border settlements and thereby free the army toprepare for conventional war. The outbreak of the intifadafour years ago has changed all that. Now Mr. Karadi and hisofficers are on the frontline of the intifada, charged withbreaking up illegal demonstrations, conducting searches forsuspected terrorists and patrolling Arab villages. In theprocess, the 5,000-person unit has earned a reputation amongPalestinians and Israelis for brutality and ruthlessness.</LP><TEXT>   Despite his M-16 rifle and special protective jacketagainst knife attacks, Mr. Karadi says it can still bedisquieting to walk through Jerusalem's Old City, somethinghe thinks few Israelis truly understand. &quot;People complainthat we're violent but they don't understand that we haverocks and molotov cocktails thrown at us night and day,&quot; hesays.   The Old City was once regularly filled with Israelis whocame to bargain and shop. Now Mr. Karadi and his men arealmost the only Israelis in sight, patrolling the invisibleborder that has divided Arabs and Israelis in Jerusalem sincethe outbreak of the intifada.   Outside the house owned by right-wing Housing MinisterAriel Sharon, a 21-year-old border policeman says he isn'tafraid to guard the house, despite the fact that it's beenthe site of a number of recent knife attacks. But he isrealistic about how the border police are viewed by thecity's residents: &quot;They hate us for being here,&quot; he says.   That is a view shared by some Israelis who areuncomfortable with the notion that the border police, ratherthan the Israeli army, has primary responsibility forhandling the intifada.   Mr. Karadi counters that, unlike the army, the borderpolice are specially trained for confronting civil unrest.But Israel Shahak, chairman of the Israeli League for Humanand Civil Rights and a long-time critic of the border police,says using the border guards to do the dirty work of theintifada allows Israelis to avoid coming to terms with thereality of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. &quot;I thinkthe border guards have actually helped prolong the intifada,&quot;he says.   Gadi Lieberman, commander of the border police inpredominantly Arab East Jerusalem, rejects that idea. &quot;We areat war everyday but it's an odd war because we aren't allowedto shoot. If we didn't have restrictions, we could havestopped the intifada by now,&quot; he says.   Mr. Lieberman acknowledges that instances of borderpolicemen abusing their power do exist. Just last month, aborder policeman was sentenced for killing a 13-year-oldPalestinian boy in a refugee camp and three others were beinginvestigated for allegedly beating an Arab resident ofJerusalem. But Mr. Lieberman says these are exceptionalcases.   Back in the Old City, Mr. Karadi is navigating his waythrough the twisted warren of alleyways that lead into theheart of the Arab quarter. &quot;This is where we found the bodyof a religious student who was murdered,&quot; he says, pointingto a wall spray-painted with graffiti. &quot;This is the streetwhere his killers lived.&quot;   While Mr. Karadi says that most of the shop-owners in theOld City are peaceful people who would like to see theintifada end and tourists and Israelis return, he still mustregard everyone with suspicion. &quot;Most of the knife attackshave been by women. An elderly woman looks innocent but thenshe suddenly takes a knife out of her bag and stabs you,&quot; hesays.   Mr. Shahak, the human rights activist, says that despiteefforts by the border police to change their image, theviolence is bound to continue because stopping the intifadarequires a political solution rather than the use of force.But that is a notion that Mr. Karadi, for one, appearsunwilling to consider, at least publicly.   &quot;Our job is to provide security so that the government canmake a political decision without pressure,&quot; says Mr. Karadi.&quot;We can provide security forever. We won't be the ones tobreak first. The terrorists will.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
