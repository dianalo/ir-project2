RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mozambique's ambassador to the United Nations,described as one of Africa's richest men, lost a Supreme Court bidtoday to shield himself from a potentially costly divorce lawsuitin Connecticut.   The justices, over one dissenting vote, let stand a ruling thatdiplomatic immunity does not protect Ambassador Antonio DeindeFernandez from being sued by his estranged wife.   Justice Harry A. Blackmun voted to hear arguments in the case,but four votes are needed to grant such review.   Connecticut courts placed an $8 million lien on Fernandez'sproperty pending the outcome of the divorce case.   The Connecticut Supreme Court ruled last September that BarbaraFernandez should have her day in court to determine whether she isentitled to the family home in Greenwich, Conn.   The state court said the Vienna Convention on DiplomaticRelations does not give the ambassador immunity in the divorce casebecause the government of Mozambique issued a waiver permitting theConnecticut courts to dissolve the marriage.   The state court said it did not have to decide whether Mrs.Fernandez would be entitled to sue for a property award even ifthere were no waiver.   The Vienna treaty allows Mrs. Fernandez's ``claim for ownershipof the family residence to be heard in this case,'' the state courtsaid. ``It is for the trial court to determine whether to grant(her) title to the disputed real property.''   But the state court said Connecticut courts lack authority toaward Mrs. Fernandez any support payments.   Mrs. Fernandez said her husband has a net worth of more than $75million and ``has admitted to being one of the richest men inAfrica.''   The couple married in Arlington, Va., in 1961 and were separatedin early 1985.   In his Supreme Court appeal, Fernandez said the divorce suitalso infringes on his diplomatic immunity by examining his privatelife.   The trial judge will hear evidence about his health, hisfinances and the reasons for the divorce, Fernandez said.   This will ``require the deepest intrusion into the ambassador'smost personal affairs _ factors that would directly challenge theprestige and dignity of the diplomat,'' his lawyers said.   Asked for their views, Justice Department lawyers said the courtshould reject Fernandez's appeal.   The case is Fernandez vs. Fernandez, 88-1042.</TEXT></DOC>
