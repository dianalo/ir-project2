Chile had said in September that it would use as much as $200 million of its reserves to buy back foreign bank debt borrowed in the name of the country's central bank. The buy-back, which eventually may be copied by other Latin American countries, will help Chile reduce its total foreign debt to $17.4 billion by Dec. 31, Mr. Somerville said. That's down 9.8% from a high of $19.3 billion at the end of 1985.    Buy-backs of foreign debt at a discount played an important part in reducing Latin American obligations in the 1930s. Then, as now, many of these countries had difficulty borrowing money abroad with which to continue servicing their foreign debts.    Unlike other Latin American countries, Chile -- at its own initiative -- set about vigorously reducing its foreign debt as early as 1985 with a pioneering debt-for-equity swap program. As of Sept. 30, Chile had exchanged $5.15 billion of its foreign debt for local currency for equity investments. The debt buy-back is part of this foreign debt reduction strategy, which is aimed at restoring the country's access to the international capital market.    A bank debt restructuring signed earlier in the year allowed Chile to use up to $500 million of its reserves to buy back its foreign bank debt, but Mr. Somerville said Chile doesn't plan to use the remaining $331.6 million anytime soon.    In response to its September proposal, Chile received 129 offers from banks to sell the country a total of $822 million of its debt, Mr. Somerville said. Chile accepted all bids for it to pay 57.5 cents or less for each dollar of its debt. The weighted average price of each dollar of debt it is buying back is 56.3 cents.    Jay H. Newman, senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said Chilean central bank debt now trades at around 56 cents on the dollar in the secondary market, down four or five cents in the past month amid a general decline in prices for developing countries' bank debt. &quot;They did very well,&quot; he said of the Chilean buy-back.    Mr. Somerville declined to give further details of which banks, or how many, had bids accepted. Analysts said a broad group of international banks in the U.S., Europe and Japan tendered debt to Chile, and that Japanese banks were among those whose bids were accepted.    While Brazil, Argentina and other Latin American countries recently have experienced soaring inflation and at best sluggish economic growth, Chile has enjoyed economic success by supplementing its traditional copper exports with foreign sales of fish, wood and fruit products. Buoyant copper prices and low oil prices also have helped Chile in recent months.    &quot;This is the only country in the area with a declining external debt and the {gross domestic product} climbing year after year,&quot; Mr. Somerville said. He said exports this year should total $6.8 billion, giving the country a foreign debt-to-exports ratio of 2.5, down from a ratio of 5.2 in 1985. Chile's gross foreign-exchange and gold reserves are slightly over $3.6 billion, meaning the country will use less than 5% of its reserves in the buy-back.    But while this is Chile's fifth consecutive year of economic growth of 5% or more, the country remains a military dictatorship, while Argentina, Brazil and Peru in recent years have restored democracy. A plebiscite held in Chile last month rejected Gen. Augusto Pinochet's bid to remain president until 1997. But, amid strong opposition, Gen. Pinochet intends to remain in power until presidential elections slated for December 1989. These events have increased uncertainty about the country's political future.    Meantime, Venezuela is returning to the international capital markets. The country is to announce today a 100 million mark ($56.4 million) bond issue, a German bank spokesman said.    This borrowing, which is lead-managed by a unit of Germany's Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, is Venezuela's first in the German capital market since 1981. The new five-year bonds carry a coupon of 8.25%. The bond issue has been split equally between Venezuelan and European-based banks. </TEXT></DOC>
