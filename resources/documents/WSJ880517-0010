Realty Officers Quit to Avoid Conflict of Interest </HL><SO> </SO><CO> LRF WNEWS </CO><DATELINE> FOSTER CITY, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lincoln N.C. Realty Fund Inc. said several top officers resigned to avoid a potential conflict of interest as the real estate investment trust renegotiates lending agreements with an associated concern the top officers work for.    Edward D. O'Brien resigned as chairman, chief executive officer and president. The company's corporate secretary, treasurer and controller also resigned.    William F. Garlock, 38-year-old director, was named president and corporate secretary. The other positions haven't been filled.    All of the officials who resigned from the REIT continue to work for Lincoln Property Co. N.C., also of Foster City. Lincoln Property, which originally sponsored the REIT, is an affiliate of closely held Lincoln Property Co. of Dallas, and is general partner for all three limited partnerships Lincoln N.C. Realty Fund has lent funds to.    Mr. Garlock, the REIT's new president, said Lincoln Property is seeking to modify terms of the agreements under which it lent money to the three partnerships. Mr. O'Brien, who is senior vice president, finance, at Lincoln Property, would have been put in the position of negotiating for both sides, explained Mr. Garlock, and he resigned on the advice of counsel. The REIT's board is reduced to six from seven.    Mr. Garlock added that the resignations came on a &quot;very friendly&quot; basis, and were unrelated to the March collapse of tentative talks calling for Gould Investors L.P and BRT Realty Trust to acquire Lincoln's assets. </TEXT></DOC>
