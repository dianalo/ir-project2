A handful of provisions, considered hardly more thanfootnotes to the Bush administration vision of a restructuredfinancial system, would generally ease restrictions on Sandamp;Lactivities.</LP><TEXT>   Though administration officials and industry lobbyistsdescribe the provisions as important to the hope of reducingthe cost of the unpopular Sandamp;L cleanup, they haven't beendebated much so far as lawmakers have focused on largerissues, such as whether to eliminate the barriers betweenbanking and commerce. These items haven't attracted muchattention this week either as Congress began considering theadministration's request to pump another $80 billion into theResolution Trust Corp.   &quot;This is far preferable than simply turning to taxpayerfunds to bail out the industry,&quot; said Richard Moose, a seniorvice president with American Express Co. &quot;In the overallreform agenda, these kind of inducements are justified.&quot;   Both the House and Senate Banking committees have backedbills that would overhaul the financial-services industry.Each includes similar language targeting thrifts.   The House measure, for example, would:   -- Make it easier for thrifts to merge with banks, and forthe resulting institution to divide its deposit insurancepremiums between the government's bank insurance fund and theSandamp;L insurance fund. The amendment is significant becausethrift premiums are expected to be much lower than bankpremiums over the next several years. The banking industryhas pledged to repay as much as $70 billion the governmentwants to borrow to keep the banks from slipping intoinsolvency.   -- Allow thrifts to count greater amounts of cash andconsumer loans to meet the so-called qualified thrift lendertest. The amendment is important because it would reduce thelevel of housing investments required of thrifts before theyqualify for certain tax breaks and access to low-cost creditthrough the Federal Home Loan Bank System.   -- Make it easier for a thrift to convert to a bank. Thiswould enable an institution to avoid the stigma of beingcalled an Sandamp;L but under certain circumstances to continue toenjoy the potential benefits of a mortgage-lending charter.   If enacted, the provisions are expected to open thrifts upas acquisition targets.   &quot;It's in the government's interest to recapitalize thethrift industry,&quot; said Timothy Ryan, director of the Officeof Thrift Supervision. &quot;The more capital there is in thesethrifts, the larger the cushion between them and taxpayers.&quot;   Mr. Moose suggested that American Express, which hasturned down several government offers to buy failed orfailing thrifts, might find similar propositions moreinviting if &quot;some of the kinds of inducements&quot; proposedbecome law.   That prospect is uncertain, given the pressure building inCongress to narrow the administration's broad overhaul plan.But Mr. Ryan says he is certain some will survive.   &quot;There's an awful lot of receptiveness to reasonablechanges,&quot; he said. &quot;It's in the government's interest.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
