Introduced by Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.)in the House and Phil Gramm (R., Texas) in the Senate, theamendments were intended to create jobs by providing suchincentives as a lower capital gains tax, more liberalindividual retirement accounts and enterprise zones.Democrats in both houses opposed the amendments on proceduralgrounds. President Bush has promised to veto the bill. Arelated editorial appears nearby.

Rep. Gingrich: Mr. Speaker, if I might just briefly state,the House just decided by 324 to 84 to add a revenue measureto the bill, and this broadened the act, and the EconomicGrowth Act, which I offer, is an amendment which relatesdirectly to unemployment by changing the Tax Code to create1,100,000 new jobs. So, it seems to me, clearly on anunemployment bill, it is germane to the question ofunemployment.                                                                                                          Mr. Rostenkowski: Mr. Speaker, I insist on my point oforder that it goes beyond the scope and content of thepending legislation.                                                                                                          Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.): The Chair is prepared torule.   The gentleman from Illinois makes a point of order thatthe amendment proposed by the motion offered by the gentlemanfrom Georgia is not germane to the bill.   The bill, as reported, is confined to provisions relatingto unemployment insurance and compensation within thejurisdiction of the committee on Ways and Means.   The agreement proposed in the motion offered by thegentleman from Georgia contains provisions &quot;to provideincentives for work, savings and investments in order tostimulate economic growth, job creation and opportunity.&quot;These provisions range beyond matters of unemploymentcompensation and involve the jurisdiction of committees otherthan the Committee on Ways and Means, to wit: the Committeeon Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs and the Committee onthe Judiciary.   Accordingly, the Chair finds the amendment is not germane,and, therefore, the motion to recommit is not in order.   The Chair sustains the point of order of the gentlemanfrom Illinois. . . .                                                                                                          From the Senate debate:                                                                                                          John Breaux (D., La.): . . . I cannot support thisamendment today for reasons including the fact that it is atax amendment on a non-tax bill and, therefore, if it ispassed would kill this important unemployment bill. . . .                                                                                                          Herb Kohl (D., Wis.): Mr. President, I commend the senatorfor Texas for offering his amendment. Our debate today isabout how best to respond to the immediate human pain causedby the current, lingering recession. The senator from Texascorrectly points out that one response -- a very good reponse-- would be to create jobs for the long-term unemployed. Hisamendment is designed to do just that.   I certainly do not object to that goal. In fact, I supportseveral elements in the senator's package. . . .   However, I do not support the senator's submission of thiscomplete package on this particular bill. . . . Making itpart of the rest of these bipartisan tax proposals guaranteesthat the whole package will be rejected as a Republicanattempt to kill a Democratic unemployment program. And thatis a shame.   It is a shame because this body should debate, in abipartisan way, the high cost of capital in this country. . ..                                                                                                          Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.): Mr. President, I support manyof the provisions in the amendment offered by thedistinguished senator from Texas. However, since approval ofthe amendment would have the effect of killing this importantlegislation to provide relief to the unemployed, I cannotsupport the amendment. . . .                                                                                                          Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.): Mr. President, I rise instrong opposition to the amendment offered by my colleagues,Sen. Gramm. His amendment is nothing more than game playing.. . . Proposals to restore full deductibility of IRAs,provide a tax credit to the first-time home buyers, establishenterprise zones, and lower capital gains taxes should bedebated by this Chamber, but we should not be debating taxreform on this much-needed measure to extend unemploymentbenefits to the two million Americans who have exhaustedtheir benefits. . . .                                                                                                          Joe Lieberman (D., Conn.): Mr. President, I must opposethe amendment by the junior senator from Texas. But I hastento add that, under other circumstances, I would activelysupport the senator's amendment. . . .                                                                                                          Mr. Gramm: . . . Mr. President, having brought up theplight of the unemployed, it is clear that the Democratsdesperately do not want to debate any real policy to dosomething about it. I have heard our collages on theleft-hand side of the Chamber, all day, talk about &quot;We need apolicy to deal with the unemployed.&quot; I ask my colleagues: Isextension of unemployment compensation a policy? Is that ananti-recession policy? Will the extension of unemploymentbenefits -- humanitarian though they may be -- create asingle job in the American economy? The answer is &quot;no.&quot; . . .   That brings me to the amendment which I have offered. Letme start with the parliamentary situation, because I knowthat there are many in this body who intend to vote on aparliamentary motion and then run back to their states andsay: &quot;I am not against this amendment. I am not against theEmergency Economic Growth Act. I am for all those provisions,but I could not vote for it because of a technicality. . . .&quot;   That is easy to fix, very easy, if we want to fix it. . .. By raising a point of order against a revenue provision ina Senate bill when the House bill has a revenue provision init, we are simply trying to limit debate on an issue that iscritically important to millions of Americans. . . .                                                                                                          Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas): . . . Mr. President, theamendment by my distinguished friend from Texas does not havea chance of becoming law. Let us understand that. What he isdoing is offering a tax amendment to a non-revenue bill, toan S-numbered bill. The Constitution makes it very clear thatsuch revenue measures must originate in the House. The pointis, it will be blue-slipped by the House and returned to theSenate, and this bill will be dead. Let there be nomisunderstanding among senators on this point. . . .   Let me further state that the chairman of the Ways andMeans Committee has personally told me that this bill, if ithas that amendment, will be blue-slipped. Make no mistakeabout it. What that means is you will have no unemploymentbenefits. . . .                                                                                                          Mr. Gramm: . . . This problem is very easy to fix. All wehave to do is to adopt my amendment, then bring up the Housebill and strike all after the enacting clause and substitutethis bill for the House bill. That eliminates the problem. Soit is an artificially created problem.   Finally, I remind my colleagues that we have voted totable these points of order arising out of a revenueprovision on a nonrevenue bill on many occasions. In fact, onSept. 7, 1988, I raised such a point of order against aHollings trade bill, and every Democratic member of theSenate who was present, except one, voted to table that pointof order. No debate was undertaken as to whether I was rightor whether I was wrong.   The point was, on many occasions, that being one of them,we have tabled this point of order. When you are voting, youare voting on the substance of this provision. . . .                                                                                                          George Mitchell (D., Maine): . . . I believe that thatamendment can be summed up in one word: phony. It is a phonyamendment with phony arguments for a phony objective.   Mr. President, every member of this Senate, indeed, everyninth-grade civics student in America, knows that theConstitution of the United States requires that all revenuemeasures originate in the House of Representatives. Thesenate has no legal or constitutional authority to initiatetax measures.   Therefore, any tax measure passed by the Senate,originating in the Senate, is dead right at that moment. ThisSenate could vote 100 to nothing in support of the pendingamendment, and it would be dead the instant the voteoccurred. Everybody knows that.   Why, then, we ask, would someone offer an amendment thateveryone knows would be dead even if passed? The answer isobvious -- to kill the bill that provides unemploymentinsurance to three million Americans who now have exhaustedtheir benefits, because not only would this amendment bekilled, it would drag down with it the bill of which itbecame a part upon approval by the Senate.   This is a naked, a transparent, an obvious effort to killthe unemployment insurance bill by attaching a tax bill to itwhich is unconstitutional and without any legal basis. Everysenator, therefore, should recognize that a vote for theGramm amendment is a vote to kill the unemployment insurancebill. . . .                                                                                                          Mr. Gramm: Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. President, if myamendment were adopted to the underlying bill, and if thedistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee then calledup the House bill, the House unemployment compensation bill,which is a revenue bill, and struck all after the enactingclause and substituted the underlying bill with my amendmentattached to it and then called for a conference with theHouse, would that bill be subject to a blue slip and subjectto being killed by the House?                                                                                                          The Presiding Officer (Richard Bryan {D., Nev.}: The Chairwould have no authority to comment on whether the House ofRepresentatives would exercise its prerogatives and blue slipthe measure.                                                                                                          Mr. Gramm: Mr. President, further propounding myparliamentary inquiry, since the House bill is a revenue billif it were brought up, as would be the normal procedure, andall after the enacting clause were struck and the Senatelanguage with my amendment was inserted, would then our billunder the H.R. number be subject to blue-slipping?                                                                                                          The Presiding Officer: The Chair is informed that theChair is unable to comment as to whether the House ofRepresentatives would choose to exercise its constitutionalprerogatives.</TEXT></DOC>
