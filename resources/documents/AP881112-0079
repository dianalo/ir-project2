DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan said Saturday the peacefultransition of power in America is ``cause for us to wonder at ourfreedom'' and to be grateful to veterans of the nation's wars.   ``In the 10 weeks before Jan. 20, 1989, we the people can takepride in just how strong our political system really is,'' Reagansaid in his weekly radio address, delivered from Camp David.   ``We take it for granted sometimes, but I couldn't help thinkingon Tuesday night how inspiring it is that we Americans can chooseour leader without fear of violence,'' the president said.   ``We have made our choice, and life goes on. We don't even needto give it a second thought, but when we do, I think it's cause forus to wonder at our freedom.''   Mixing reflections on the transition with commemoration of hislast Veterans' Day weekend as president, Reagan said, ``We continueto enjoy our freedom because of those brave Americans who havelegitimately taken up arms in the service of their country.''   Reagan also repeated a note he has sounded often as he spoke onbehalf of Vice President Bush's successful campaign for thepresidency, saying that ``if there is one change George Bush and Imade that touches me most profoundly it would probably be this: Onceagain our young men and women are proud to wear the uniform of theircountry.''   The president did not elaborate on the remark, but has oftenboasted that his administration rebuilt American military mightafter a period of neglect. Reagan took office in 1981, succeedingDemocrat Jimmy Carter.   Reagan also took issue with some critics who say that Bush doesnot have a strong mandate because issues were not spelled outclearly enough during the campaign.   ``George Bush has gotten his mandate from the American people, amandate to continue the policies that have brought peace andprosperity to the American people, to bring hope and opportunity toall Americans and to expand the frontiers of freedom around theworld,'' the president said.   In the Democrats' weekly broadcast response, House Speaker JimWright extended congratulations to Bush and thanked voters forincreasing the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate.   He noted it was the first time since 1908 that Americans haveelected a president of one party and at the same time increased themajority for the other party in the House, Senate and governor'soffices across the country.   ``And so, if there is any clear mandate, perhaps the Americanpeople are telling both parties _ both president and Congress _ towork together to achieve those things that so desperately need to bedone for our whole country,'' he said.   Wright, D-Texas, said Democrats would like to help him achievehis goal of making America a ``kinder, gentler nation.''   The speaker said Bush will find bipartisan support in Congress onseveral of his campaign promises. He mentioned specifically Bush'spledges to become an ``education president,'' to clean up theenvironment, raise the minimum wage and improve the quality andavailability of day-care facilities.   ``These will make a fine start toward that `kinder, gentlernation,''' Wright said.</TEXT></DOC>
