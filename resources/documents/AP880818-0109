Two hostages and a police officer were killed duringthe two-day ordeal.   The robbers and a female accomplice had freed all but two oftheir hostages before the shootout today on the highway in BadHonnef, police said. One hostage was killed in the gunbattle andthe other seriously injured, police said. The two bank robbers andtheir accomplice also were hurt.   Another hostage and a policeman died Wednesday when the robbersand their accomplice held about 25 people in a bus theycommandeered.   The hostage drama ended this afternoon after police stopped aspeeding car carrying the two bank robbers, their accomplice andtwo women hostages.   Police spokesman Horst Fechner said officers stopped the car bysetting off exploding devices that emit a powerful flash of light,then closed in from both sides. Hesse state radio said a specialtactical unit led the assault.   Fechner said that in the gunfire that ensued, one of the womenhostages was killed and the other received ``life-threateninginjuries.'' He said he could not release their names.   The spokesman said the two gunmen, Hans-Juergen Roesner, 31, and32-year-old Dieter Degowski, were seriously injured and theirfemale accomplice received minor injuries. Her name was notreleased.   Fechner is the police spokesman in the city of Recklinghausen,where a special command post had been set up to coordinate thepolice strategy.   Ambulances and medical rescue helicopters sped to Bad Honnef.Many people stopped their cars and watched the gunbattle, leadingto massive traffic jams.   The ordeal started when the gunmen took two hostages during abank robbery Tuesday morning in the northwestern town of Gladbeckand later fled in a car provided by authorities. They escaped withtwo hostages and $227,000. Police provided $162,000 of the money totry to ensure the hostages' safety.   The gunmen surfaced Wednesday in Bremen, 135 miles northwest ofGladbeck. Police said they opened fire in a vegetable market andtook a third hostage. No one was injured.   The bandits then commandeered the nearby passenger bus and droveaway with about 30 hostages. Five elderly people were freed beforethe bus careened along the autobahn for several hours lateWednesday and early today.   Police spokesman Hermann Wahl in the city of Recklinghausen nearGladbeck said a policeman died in a crash and two others wereinjured while pursuing the gunmen.   The armed robbers also shot to death a 15-year-old Italian boyaboard the bus after police captured the robbers' accomplice. Shewas later set free, and the bus crossed the border into theNetherlands.   It was not clear when the gunmen were joined by the femaleaccomplice. Wahl said she was shot today in the Netherlands whentwo hostages tried to flee.   The hijackers shot and wounded two of their captives about 6a.m. today before freeing most of the hostages, Dutch policespokesman Jan Houdel said. Their condition was not known.   The spokesman said that after freeing all but two captives nearthe Dutch border town of Oldenzaal, the gunmen, their woundedcompanion and two women hostages got into a high-powered BMW sedanand raced back into West Germany at about 8 a.m.   ``We assume they are looking for a hospital,'' Wahl said at thetime.   After racing through the Ruhr industrial area, the car carryingthe bandits stopped in the center of the Rhine River city ofCologne late this morning and was immediately surrounded byjournalists.   ``We aren't going to negotiate with police any more, because weknow that leads to nothing,'' said Degowski. ``I want to saythrough the news media, that the police should back off.''   He sat in the back seat of the dark gray BMW sedan, pointing apistol at a young woman hostage squeezed beside him.   The woman, who was not identified, said she felt ``good.''   ``I was afraid before, because I thought the police might movein and I'd be killed,'' she said. It was not immediately known ifthe young woman was the hostage later killed.   Roesner, the other gunman, sat at the steering wheel andcriticized the police. He occasionally waved his pistol at thecrowd of reporters.   After a little more than an hour, the car sped away toward Bonn,10 miles to the south, and into the final police roadblocks.   Throughout the ordeal, the West German news media providedclose-up shots of the gunmen and their victims, including one ofthe gunmen putting a pistol to a hostage's head.   West Germany's ARD television network also showed footage thismorning of one of the bandits counting money.   The television showed bullet holes in a taxicab used byjournalists as they tried to chase the bus across northwesternGerman highways early today. The gunmen fired the shots from thefleeing bus.   ``The Hostage Drama as a Media Event,'' commented theFrankfurter Rundschau daily newspaper under a front-page photographof Roesner and Degowski.</TEXT></DOC>
