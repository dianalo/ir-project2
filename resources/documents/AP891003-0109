Nopickup.</HEAD><BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   No common-law marriage exists between WilliamHurt and Sandra Jennings, a judge ruled today, precluding Hurt'sformer live-in lover from claiming nearly half ``The Big Chill''star's movie millions.   State Supreme Court Justice Jacqueline Silbermann said that therelationship was illicit when it began because Hurt was married tosomeone else, and that it did not become legitimate simply becausethe actor got divorced.   ``Absent proof of a mutual agreement to be married, an agreementto marry cannot be inferred from the fact that the parties wereliving together,'' the judge said. ``The contrary is true.''   If the judge had determined the two were married under commonlaw, Ms. Jennings could have pursued up to half Hurt's earnings.The decision did not deal with support for the couple's 6-year-oldson, Alexander Devon Hurt.   Jennings' lawyer, A. Richard Golub, called the ruling a ``joke''and said he would appeal. The judge is ``so madly in love with thisdefendant, Bill Hurt, that we never could have gotten a fairshake,'' he said.   ``If we had won, I would have been shocked,'' Golub said.   Jennings, a former dancer, sued Hurt for equitable distributionof his assets, estimated by Golub at $5 million to $7 million,after Hurt refused to increase financial support to her and theirson. Under an agreement between Hurt and Jennings, he was payingthem $60,000 to $65,000 a year.   Jennings, 32, based her suit on four of the 10 weeks she spentwith Hurt in Beaufort, S.C., during the winter of 1982-83 while hewas there filming ``The Big Chill.'' The movie was about a reunionof 1960s-era college chums.   Common-law marriages were abolished in 1933 in New York state,where Jennings and Hurt also lived, but South Carolina recognizessuch unions.   Jennings contended that during the four weeks between Dec. 9,when Hurt learned actress Mary Beth Hurt had divorced him, and Jan.10, when Jennings and Hurt left the state, a common-law marriageexisted between them.   Hurt's publicist, Lois Smith, was at the courthouse waiting withreporters when copies of the decision were handed out, and shedistributed a statement from the actor, who has starred in suchfilms as ``Body Heat,'' ``Children of a Lesser God,'' ``Kiss of theSpider Woman'' and ``The Accidental Tourist.''   ``I am thankful for the ruling received today, which is avindication of everything I have said and that has been said bythose who have supported me,'' the statement said.   Hurt was ``perplexed'' when Jennings brought the suit, Smithsaid. Prior to trial, Hurt had suggested Jennings was trying tosimply shake him down for more support.</TEXT></DOC>
