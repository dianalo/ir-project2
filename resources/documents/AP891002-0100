The justices, without comment, turned away arguments thatfederal law does not allow such fee bonuses when lawyers win casesin which there was a substantial risk of non-payment because of aloss.   Various lawsuits against GM, each alleging that less efficientengines and transmissions were substituted in certain lines ofcars, were consolidated into one ``class action'' case in 1982.   The case was settled in 1985 after GM agreed to establish a $17million fund to be shared by those who sued.   A federal judge awarded the consumers' lawyers nearly $2 millionin fees, to be paid out of the fund. The award was based on timeexpended and reasonable hourly rates.   The judge refused to enhance the fee award as a bonus for takinga risky case on a contingency fee basis, ruling that the federalMagnuson-Moss Act bars any such ``risk multiplier'' of a lawyer'sfees.   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the award rulinglast year and ordered the judge to apply a risk multiplier in theGM case.   The judge then awarded an additional $1.2 million in lawyer fees.   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for GM argued that theappeals court ruling conflicts with language in the Magnuson-MossAct and with a 1987 Supreme Court decision limiting lawyer-feebonuses.   The 7th Circuit court rejected a narrow reading of the federallaw's language. The appeals court said the 1987 ruling did notapply to the GM case because a settlement had resulted in a commonfund for payments to consumers and their lawyers.   GM lawyers called the appeals court ruling a ``patent evasion''of the 1987 high court ruling. They said the appeals court decision``will increase the incentive for plaintiffs' attorneys to clog thecourts with marginal lawsuits in the hope of recovering largemultipliers, while spawning complex litigation over the collateralissue of attorneys' fees.''   GM's appeal was supported in a ``friend-of-the-court'' briefsubmitted by the National Association of Counties, the NationalGovernors' Association, the National League of Cities and the U.S.Conference of Mayors.   The brief noted that state and local governments ``are among thedefendants most frequently sued under federal statutes providingfor awards of attorney fees.''   The case is GM vs. Skelton, 88-1848.</TEXT></DOC>
