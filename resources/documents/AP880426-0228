Theparade also was a reminder of an equally long civil war theregime's Soviet sponsors are about to abandon.   Thousands of the 40,000 soldiers conscripted to defend thegovernment of Afghan leader Najib against Moslem guerrillas marchedpast the leadership in a parade modeled on Red Square observancesof May Day and Revolution Day.   Soldiers, workers and weapons coursed for more than two hoursthrough Ideghi Square after a night of unusually heavy rifle fireand a guerrilla rocket strike in the hills east of the city.Joining the parade were 10 T-62 tanks not previously known to be inthe Afghan arsenal.   Najib led dozens of Afghan officials and a Soviet delegation tothe parade. About 500 guests and visiting journalists wereclustered under striped awnings on a reviewing stand.   The senior Soviet official was Vladimir Orlov, head of theRussian Republic's parliament. His minor rank appeared to reflectthe Kremlin desire for a low profile after agreeing this month tostart pulling its estimated 115,000 soldiers out of the country onMay 15.   Yuri Sapounov, a Foreign Ministry official who accompaniedjournalists from Moscow, denied suggestions that the Soviets weresnubbing celebrations of the April 1978 coup that broughtCommunists to power.   He acknowledged, however, that Soviet representation was acontrast with a Politburo-level group that went to Addis Ababa in1984 for the 10th anniversary of the Marxist government thatoverthrew Emperor Haile Selassie.   ``What is there to celebrate here?'' Sapounov asked. ``There isa civil war going on.''   A Moslem insurgency began immediately after the coup that oustedPresident Mohammed Daoud a decade ago. More than 5 million Afghansfled _ about one-third of the population _ most of them toAfghanistan's neighbors on the east and west, Pakistan and Iran.   Towns and refugee camps that house more than 3 million Afghansjust inside Pakistan serve as bases and supply points for theinsurgents, and the major guerrilla groups have their headquartersin Pakistan.   Despite a lukewarm show of Kremlin support for the Kabulfestivities, Najib's government followed the Soviet style from themass demonstration of worker support to taped chants and songsblared across the parade ground through a scratchy public addresssystem.   Platoons of soldiers with Soviet-supplied Kalashnikov assaultrifles parade-stepped past the leaders, over whom half a dozenbodyguards with Uzi machine guns kept watch.   After sunset, Afghan soldiers fired shots into the air duringprivate celebrations.   Similar firing was heard Monday night but a member of the AfghanState Committee for Peace, Solidarity and Friendship confirmed thata loud explosion early Tuesday was a guerrilla rocket landing inthe eastern hills.   ``It was especially noisy last night, perhaps because they (theguerrillas) wanted to say something about the holiday,'' said theofficial, who asked that his name not be used.   On Monday, Najib proposed a withdrawal of government soldiersfrom posts near the Pakistani border to create ``a non-militaryline'' between the two countries. He said Afghan troops would leavetheir positions if guerrillas and Pakistani soldiers did the same.   The proposal seemed to be little more than a face-savingadmission of the difficulties the Afghan army has in fending offguerrilla attacks.   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, head of the seven-party guerrilla alliance,said Tuesday in Peshawar, Pakistan, the insurgents reject the ideaof such a zone.   ``Afghan refugees will be reluctant to return even to thoseareas that have been abandoned by the Soviet and Afghan troops,''he told a news conference, and ``they want to be convinced thatpeace has returned to afghanistan.''   Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979,replaced one Communist government with another and remained to helpfight the insurgents.   Najib became leader in May 1986, succeeding Babrak Karmal, whois believed to be in the Soviet Union.   On May 15, the Red Army is to begin leaving Afghanistan under aU.N.-mediated accord signed April 15 in Geneva by Afghanistan andPakistan, and by the United States and Soviet Union as guarantors.   The United States, China and several other countries have aidedAfghan guerrillas via Pakistan. Each superpower has reserved theright to continue aid while the other does.   Afghan insurgents were not direct parties to the Geenevaagreement and say they will continue fighting.</TEXT></DOC>
