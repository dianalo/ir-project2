This was undertaken to specify more precisely the building envelopeareas for solar gain and heat loss analyses. The study shows that mostwindows are made up of about 70% glass and 30% framing, regardless ofmake and type. An exception to this is the bay window which has moreglass area as a fraction of the rough opening, due to its shape. In thelatter case, the glass area is about 90% of the rough opening. Methodsof integrating these findings into the CMHC-2 computer program are discussed.12 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
