Waving his arms and shouting with his forlorn wife, Elena,seated nearby, Ceausescu branded as lies the charges that thecouple was responsible for the deaths of 60,000 during their24-year reign and the crackdown on protesters last week.   ``Everything that was said here was false, and I don't want totalk any more,'' he declared at one point.   ``I'm not guilty, I'm not guilty. I will answer only in front ofthe Grand National Assembly and in front of the working-class.These are lies,'' he said as the couple sat behind a table, with noother people in the room visible.   Later, the videotape broadcast on Romanian television showed thebodies of the couple sprawled by a wall after their executionsMonday by firing squad, the first confirmation for Romanians thattheir revolution had been won.   An official said the couple that ruled their country togetherwere granted their last wish: that their executions be carried outsimultaneously. Hundreds reportedly volunteered for thethree-member firing squad.   The revolutionary National Salvation Committee, which says it isa provisional government until free elections can be held in April,chose Ion Iliescu as chairman of a new 37-member governing councilon Tuesday.   It also named as prime minister a professor who said heconvinced the army to join the revolt.   Additionally, the new government issued a decree that throws outsome of Ceausescu's most vicious and oppressive laws _ includingthose prohibiting contact with foreigners, free travel and evenownership of typewriters.   The government also ordered the Interior Ministry's brutalsecurity forces be put under control of the Defense Ministry, whichoversees the army that sided with the revolutionaries.   According to radio and Romanian sources, security forces loyalto Ceausescu were surrendering by the hundreds Tuesday, apparentlyconvinced of defeat by news of their ousted ruler's execution.   But sporadic gunfire still rang through parts of the capital,where many buildings were burned or battered by the fightingbetween army units backing the revolution and secret police loyalto Ceausescu.   Ceausescu and his wife were reported captured on Saturday andtried and executed two days later. Television early Tuesdaybroadcast the first footage of the couple in captivity, along withthe film of their bodies.   The 71-year-old Ceausescu looked gaunt and unshaven and deniedthat he ordered the brutal suppression during last week's protestsagainst his rule.   His wife, sometimes restrained from speaking by her husband,defiantly blasted back at unseen prosecutors accusing the family ofstashing hard currency in Swiss banks.   ``Prove it,'' she retorted. ``This is a base provocation.''   Ceausescu denied that there were deaths in Bucharest's PalaceSquare on Thursday, when there were reports that troops fired onprotesters who turned out for his failed pro-governmentdemonstration.   ``Nobody was shot in the Palace Square,'' Ceausescu said.   ``Do you know that you were sacked as president and as supremecommander of the army?'' the court asked at point.   ``No, I do not recognize this. I am the president of theSocialist Republic of Romania,'' he replied.   The government said the couple was tried by a secret militarytribunal for grave crimes against the Romanian people, includinggenocide and ruining the economy. It said the genocide involved thedeaths of more than 60,000 people during their 24 years in power.   The government also said the couple had stashed more than $1billion in foreign banks.   A military officer who asked not to be identified said 300soldiers volunteered for the firing squad, but only three werechosen. The Ceausescus' last wish was to die together, he said.   ``All of us wanted to see the dictator shot. You have seen it,the dictators have been executed!'' exulted a Bucharest Radioannouncer.   For some, however, even death was too good for Ceausescu, whoran a network of terror with 700,000 secret police and imposedrationing on his people while exporting food to pay for monumentsto his own glory.   ``He should be stripped naked, and his body paraded through thestreets,'' said Dimitru Minca, whose 14-year-old grandson was amongCeausescu's victims.   Still in custody and facing trial was Ceausescu's eldest son,Nicu, and a daughter, Zoia.   Thousands of people were reported killed as Ceausescu tried tocrush burgeoning protests that began Dec. 15. The army joined theuprising Friday, forcing Ceausescu to flee, and thousands more arebelieved to have been killed during the fighting with pro-Ceausescuforces.   A group of dissidents, intellectuals, disaffected governmentofficials and rebellious army commanders have been trying to runthe nation under the umbrella name National Salvation Committee.   On Tuesday, the committee said Iliescu, 59, would remainchairman of the committee. Reputed to be a college chum of SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev, he was an early rising star underCeausescu but was demoted in 1971 after disagreements over thedictator's style and his pace of reform.   It also named Petre Roman, a 43-year-old professor of hydraulicengineeering with no political background, as prime minister.   The government has been headquartered at the TV station, sceneof some of the heaviest fighting. During one attack Friday, Romantold reporters he was on the committee because he helped persuadethe army to join the revolt.   Named as defense minister was Gen. Nicolas Militaru, who retiredeight years ago from the army as commander of the Bucharestgarrison, one of many military men toppled by Ceausescu, whosedistrust of the army grew after an attempted military coup in 1984.   Because of the new decree, Militaru's duties now will includecommand of all security troops. Under the new law, the onlyparamilitary units under the Interior Ministry will be trafficpolice, firefighters and prison guards.   The changes also scrap laws forbidding unauthorized contact withforeigners requiring intellectuals to live in the same city wherethey work _ a measure frequently used to banish outspoken voices toremote towns.   Laws prohibiting abortions to women with less than five childrenand requiring registration of typewriters also were abolished, aswere Ceausescu's plans to destroy thousands of villages and forcepeople into shoddy new housing in towns.   About 10 new political parties have been formed since Saturday,all weak and badly organized, and a small but noisy demonstrationhas already denounced the new government, some of whose membershave promised free elections.   About a thousand people gathered outside of the CentralCommittee building to demand that no Communists be included in anynew government. They objected that the television station refusedto cover them.   ``These are the first days of liberty and already they aresuppressing us,'' said Christian Radulescu, a doctor.</TEXT></DOC>
