But &quot;substantial hurdles&quot; must still be overcomeand such transfers are unlikely for several years.</LP><TEXT>   Nevertheless, the study, &quot;Uranium in the New WorldMarket,&quot; says that there is a huge glut of the mineral, eventhough consumption will continue to exceed annual productionin the next decade.   &quot;Inventories in Western and Eastern bloc nations aresufficient to satisfy nuclear reactor requirements for fiveyears,&quot; says Wolf Gehrisch, author of the report.   The study forecasts that total world demand for uraniumwill grow at an annual rate of 2.1% to 64,000 metric tons bythe year 2000 from 55,000 tons in 1991. But Western output,which declined &quot;significantly&quot; in recent years, will fall farshort of demand.   That expected shortfall could be met by higher exportsfrom Russia and to a lesser extent from other former Sovietrepublics and China, Mr. Gehrisch says.   &quot;The uranium export policies of Russia and other formerSoviet republics will critically affect Western producersover the next decade and beyond,&quot; he says.   Soviet sales to the West and mainly to the U.S. arecurrently as much as 12% of total annual world supplies, saysPhillip Crowson, chairman of the Institute's supply/demandcommittee. China is exporting around 1,000 tons a year, hesaid.   Indeed, annoyed about a surge in imports of Sovieturanium, the U.S. mining industry last month persuaded theCommerce Department to open an investigation into allegeddumping. That investigation contributed to a recovery in spoturanium prices to $8.75 a pound at the end of December from$7.40 at the end of November, says Nuexco, an internationaluranium broker.   Yet trading conditions were &quot;thin&quot; Nuexco says, and pricescompare with a peak of $43.70 in 1978.   The Uranium Institute isn't prepared to forecast prices,but it says that strategic uranium stockpiles of the U.S. andthe former U.S.S.R. &quot;exceed foreseeable needs&quot; and&quot;potentially some of this material could be disposed of inthe market.&quot; Germany and Canada have sold uranium fromstrategic stockpiles and Australia is about to follow suit.   Meanwhile, utilities in North America, Europe and EastAsia hold around 160,000 metric tons of uranium and between40,000 to 80,000 metric tons in excess of requirements, thestudy says.</TEXT></DOC>
