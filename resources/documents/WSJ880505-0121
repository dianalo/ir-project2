It is generally acknowledged that the sanctions already in place have caused thousands of black South Africans to lose their jobs. What isn't known is that sanctions have cost just two small parts of the U.S. economy more than $600 million since 1985.    By almost every standard, the sanctions imposed on South Africa in 1986 have been a failure. The dismantling of apartheid has slowed to a crawl, black businesses are shutting their doors and American influence in the region has never been lower. But South Africa itself has never been the only concern of the pro-sanctions lobby. It is noteworthy that these major pro-sanctions drives always seem to emerge in U.S. election years, suggesting they have more to do with influencing political outcomes here than in South Africa.    But sanction politics can cut both ways, and before Members of Congress throw more gasoline on the fires of South Africa they might want to examine the costs sanctions and disinvestment have imposed on the U.S.    A recent study by Wharton Econometrics found that a U.S. embargo on imports of South African coal led that country to slash its coal prices in an effort to maintain market share. Wharton found this so depressed the world price of coal that U.S. coal exporters lost $250 million in 1986 and 1987 alone. The National Coal Association says this meant lost jobs for between 3,000 and 7,000 U.S. miners.    The pending sanctions bill would also ban imports of chrome, platinum and other strategic minerals, though some strategic minerals could be imported if a President were willing to certify they were essential for defense. A U.S. Bureau of Mines study due out this month estimates a ban on minerals would cost the economy $1.85 billion a year. The Commerce Department says banning imports of uranium and uranium oxide would cost the U.S. nuclear-fuels industry $300 million a year.    Federal import bans have been supplemented by dozens of state and city governments that have forced their pension funds to sell the stocks of U.S. companies doing business in South Africa. The New Jersey Division of Investment reports that divestment cost the state $32.5 million in brokerage fees and $330 million in lower stock earnings in the two years since its divestment began in August 1985. Wisconsin's state investment board estimates that a proposed divestment bill would cost more than $34 million a year in lower earnings. Thor Ronay of the Washington-based Foundation for Africa's Future points out that New Jersey's investment losses alone could have bought 160,000 South African black squatters modest homes with indoor plumbing.    Sanctions supporters in Congress are well aware of their economic effects as well as the dwindling support they enjoy among South African blacks. But the same Members who passed a 1,000-page trade bill ostensibly to &quot;protect&quot; American workers are willing to destroy jobs with another round of sanctions. Rep. Stephen Solarz admits more sanctions might cost U.S. jobs, but says, &quot;It may well be necessary in the pursuit of vital American interests for us to be prepared to pay a certain price ourselves at home.&quot; As always, the price won't be paid by Members of Congress but by others. </TEXT></DOC>
