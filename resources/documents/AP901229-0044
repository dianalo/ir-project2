The violence in the town of Gaza and the Rafah refugee campbegan in the afternoon after troops killed two masked Arabactivists who were caught writing slogans on the wall and refusedto obey the soldiers' orders to stop, Israel radio and Palestinianjournalists said.   The two were identified as 16-year-old Osama Ismail el-Bulbeisiand 19-year-old Islam Harb. Arab accounts said both were shot inthe head.   When news of the deaths spread in Rafah, an angry Palestinianmob pelted the soldiers with stones. Troops fired, killing anothertwo Arabs, the radio said.   The reports said more than 100 people were wounded.   The army command earlier said there were ``local disturbances''in the refugee camps of Jabaliya and Khan Yunis. In Khan Yunis,three firebombs were also hurled at Israeli soldiers. No injurieswere reported.   Israeli officials have predicted there would be a surge in the3-year-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza,linking it to Tuesday's ``Fatah Day.''   It marks the 26th anniversary of the first anti-Israeli attackby Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah wing of the PalestineLiberation Organization. In the raid on Jan. 1, 1965, a Fatahguerrilla squad infiltrated Israel and placed a small bomb at thecountry's National Water Carrier. One guerrilla was later killed ina clash with the Jordanian army.   At least 781 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops orcivilians in the revolt. An additional 322 Palestinians have beenkilled by fellow Arabs on suspicion of collaborating with Israel.Fifty-seven Israelis have also been slain in the violence.</TEXT></DOC>
