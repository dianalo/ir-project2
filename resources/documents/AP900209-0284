GM Chairman Roger Smith and Chrysler Vice Chairman GeraldGreenwald, meeting separately with reporters previewing the ChicagoAuto Show, said changes in the fickle U.S. car and truck marketcould result in more plant shutdowns this year.   Separately, Smith said he expected GM to report company-recordsales of $125 billion for 1989 next week, up by about $1.4 billionfrom the previous year.   Ford and Chrysler also report their earnings next week.   Slow sales and rising inventories prompted temporary plantshutdowns last month, which put thousands of auto workers on layoffbut significantly reduced new-car inventory levels   Inventories of unsold cars now are at between 60 days and 70days supply, considered normal for this time of year, compared withbetween 90 and 100 days at the end of December based on the currentselling rate.   In January the automakers, particularly Chrysler, trimmedproduction and experienced higher-than-anticipated sales as thefull effect of buyer incentive programs announced the month beforebecame apparent.   Executives at each of the Big Three automakers have said theirinventories are in line with production now, although it may notstay that way for GM and Chrysler.   ``We're going to have to see how the market evolves,'' Greenwaldsaid Friday.   Later, Smith said he didn't see any need to close a plant in thenear future, but added, ``These are things you have to stay looseand roll with.''   On Thursday, Ford North American sales Vice President RobertRewey had said ``I believe that the inventory correction that weplanned was essentially completed at the end of January.''   Ford is the only one of the Big Three that has not announced aplant shutdown or large-scale indefinite layoffs for 1990.   Chrysler shut down its Detroit subcompact car plant a week agoand plans to close its car plant in St. Louis on Sept. 21. GM willclose its Lakewood car assembly plant in Atlanta in mid-March.   GM and Chrysler also will be removing shifts and slowingproduction rates at other plants, resulting in indefinite layoffs.   Also Friday:   _Greenwald said some bids had been received for its ChryslerTechnologies Corp. subsidiary, and indicated that talks aboutselling the company, which includes Gulfstream Aerospace Inc., werein late stages. However, he declined to discuss any details withreporters and said negotiations were at their most delicate stage.   _Toyota Motor Corp. introduced its new minivan, the Previa. Its2.4-liter, four-cylinder engine is mounted under the front seats,behind the front axle. Base price for the imported vehicle, whichwill arrive in showrooms in limited numbers next week, will be$13,998, said Bob McCurry, executive vice president for Toyota'sU.S. marketing organization.   McCurry said the company expected to import a relatively modest40,000 of the Japanese-built vehicles during 1990.   _Smith said a decision would be made within 90 days of how toproceed, if at all, with an electric-powered vehicle. GM firstshowed its Impact electric car last month in Los Angeles.   He said the company's options included production of the Impact,transferring the Impact's technology to an existing car, such asthe Geo Storm made for GM by Isuzu Motors Corp., or delaying aproduction decision altogether.</TEXT></DOC>
