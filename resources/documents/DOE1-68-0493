They do not fulfill the requirements of the validlaw of procedure for such expert opinions. This does not mean, however,that the technical rules and codes are completely irrelevant in thiscontext. They only do not fall under the specific regulations for expertevidence. The status they may actually be given depends on the generalrules of procedure, or on the procedural law to be applied.
