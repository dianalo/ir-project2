A federal grand jury in Oklahoma City has subpoenaed records from a handful of companies, including Phillips Petroleum Co., a Koch Industries Inc. unit, and a number of smaller petroleum concerns, according to these officials. The overall thrust of the investigation, the officials said, is to determine whether some pipelines and other purchasers illegally colluded in establishing posted prices for purchasing oil and natural gas.    But the scope of the government's efforts isn't clear, either in terms of the states involved or of the specific companies that may be targets of the grand jury inquiry. Justice Department spokesmen declined to provide details about the investigation, which was first reported by a Tulsa, Okla., newspaper.    James Weiss, head of the Justice Department office conducting the investigation, said in an interview yesterday that the Oklahoma grand jury is investigating oil and gas acquisition patterns, but he declined to elaborate.    However, persons familiar with the investigation said that, among other things, antitrust officials are looking into fluctuations of prices posted by companies acquiring crude oil and natural gas from producers in parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and other areas. Posted prices, which are used throughout the industry, are based on quality, transportation costs and other factors.    It isn't clear if the Justice Department suspects the alleged improprieties are localized, or whether there are plans to empanel additional grand juries to look into the matter.    The Justice Department investigation, according to some officials, involves many of the same questions that California state officials have raised in the past to challenge practices of pipelines purchasing crude oil from some Southern California producers. The investigation also is expected to involve the prices paid by some refiners, officials said.    In Bartlesville, Okla., a Phillips Petroleum spokesman confirmed that the company received a subpoena from the Oklahoma City grand jury in October. The spokesman said the company was complying with the request.    Koch Industries, a Wichita, Kan.-based energy and chemical concern, said it received a subpoena but didn't elaborate. </TEXT></DOC>
