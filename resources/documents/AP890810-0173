(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former live-in maid who bilked nearly$900,000 from an elderly, paralyzed widow kept prisoner in her ownhome was sentenced Thursday to three years in prison.   Barbara June Stevens, 54, was sentenced to serve the prison termalong with 10 years probation under a plea bargain struck withprosecutors last month.   Prosecutors said Ms. Stevens confined 71-year-old Valeria Lustto her Lakeland home by taking away the woman's walker andtelephone and by giving her illegally obtained prescription drugsto keep her sleepy.   Some of the $883,534 stolen from the widow in 1987-88 went toFountain of Life Inc., a TV ministry in Greenville, N.C., and toSonshine Cathedral in Highland City, authorities said.   Under the plea agreement, Ms. Stevens is required to testify andcooperate in the investigation of Fountain of Life televangelistJim Whittington and the Rev. Daniel Atwood, former pastor ofSonshine Cathedral.   Neither Wittington nor Atwood _ who is serving a prison sentencein Pennsylvania for stealing from followers _ has been charged inthe case.   Ms. Stevens pleaded guilty last month to charges includingkidnapping, forgery, grand theft and conspiracy. In the pleabargain, prosecutors agreed to drop 55 other charges that couldhave brought a life prison term.   Assistant Public Defender Frank Solorzano said at the sentencinghearing that Ms. Stevens was ``largely a victim herself.''   ``She's a very religious person,'' he said. ``She looks forfalse prophets.''</TEXT></DOC>
