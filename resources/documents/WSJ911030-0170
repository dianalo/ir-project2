The company has drawn up plans to reimburse customers whowere charged for the service even though they stopped usingit, ATandamp;T said. However, ATandamp;T, which has more than 50 millionlong-distance telephone service customers, wouldn't disclosehow many former Reach Out customers were involved or the costof reimbursing them and its impact on earnings.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;ATandamp;T says {in its advertisements} they want you back, butapparently they won't let you leave,&quot; said Ralph Robinson ofDoraville, Ga., who says he was billed for five months ofsubscription fees even though he canceled ATandamp;T service lastMay.   &quot;What we did was perfectly lawful and fully consistentwith the Reach Out America terms filed&quot; with the FederalCommunications Commission, said an ATandamp;T spokesman. He blamedthe problem on the &quot;pace of competition in the long-distanceindustry&quot; and the inordinate amount of time it took for ATandamp;Tto get &quot;complex data&quot; on phone customers from the local phonecompanies, which send out ATandamp;T's bill with their own localservice charges. &quot;It took us time to get our arms around theproblem,&quot; he said.   ATandamp;T said it plans to launch a &quot;full-scale campaign&quot; tocontact all Reach Out subscribers who have quit ATandamp;T'sservice and have not used their plans and that thesecustomers &quot;will be advised to call ATandamp;T and customerrepresentatives {who} will work with them to resolve anyclaims and, if appropriate, issue credits.&quot; These creditscould then be applied to local and long-distance charges oncustomers' monthly phone bills.   However, ATandamp;T's disclosure drew an icy response fromconsumer activists and the company's long-distance nemesis,MCI Communications Corp.   &quot;Consumers think that when they cancel ATandamp;T {service},they're canceling Reach Out,&quot; said Ken McEldowney, executivedirector of Consumer Action, which is based in San Francisco.&quot;ATandamp;T should be giving automatic refunds to customers whoswitched from ATandamp;T and not waiting for customers to notifythem.&quot;   &quot;ATandamp;T and other carriers are notified every 24 hourselectronically by the local phone company when a customerswitches to another long-distance carrier,&quot; said Gerald H.Taylor, president of MCI Consumer Markets. ATandamp;T's failure tonotify customers &quot;was deliberate,&quot; he added. &quot;No companybills you after you've left them. It's excellent for revenuegeneration, and in a very competitive market it saves youfrom having to call each customer at home.&quot; What's more,having the customer call gives ATandamp;T &quot;another chance to try topersuade them to stay&quot; with its service, he said.   The disclosure by the nation's largest long-distance phonecarrier follows its strong consumer activist stance last yearto stop its long-distance rivals from switching consumers totheir own long-distance services without the customers'permission. This practice -- known in the industry as&quot;slamming&quot; -- led tens of thousands of ATandamp;T customers to beswitched to MCI and other carriers without their permission,according to consumer activists and local phone companies,which are charged with implementing the service change when acustomer orders it.   ATandamp;T's spokesman said &quot;there have been very fewcomplaints&quot; and that the Reach Out charges have been going onsince the Reach Out plan was first offered in 1984. But hesaid it wasn't until mid-1990 that the company discovered&quot;that this could become an issue&quot; with its customers. &quot;Wesaid, `Gee we need to find a way to address this situation,'&quot;he said.   ATandamp;T's problem comes as MCI has launched a counter-attackto win back customers through a service plan called Friends andamp;Family. Mr. Taylor said the new plan, which gives discountsto MCI customers and their friends and family members, hasled three million subscribers to switch to MCI's service fromATandamp;T and others in the past six months. Even so, ATandamp;Tcontinues to report record long-distance revenue growth, andits numbers show that its loss of market share has beenstopped.</TEXT></DOC>
