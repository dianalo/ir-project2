In the old, undemocratic South Korea, farmers and other ordinary people weren't allowed a say when it came to matters like import policy.    Now, with democratization in full swing, farmers felt free to let fly at Mr. Lee to express their dissatisfaction over import liberalization. For the first time, Korean interest groups are competing with one another and the government to influence policy. No one promised that democratization would make things easier -- for Koreans or policy-makers in Washington and other capitals.    Yet, for all the difficulties, a handful of nations around the world are making strides in political and economic liberalization that are paying off.    These stand out among dozens of other nations where either political or economic freedoms, or both, are lacking. South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey and Thailand are four of the handful, and this article begins a series on managing the problems of simultaneous democratization and economic liberalization.    In Korea, as the government moves toward freer trade, &quot;political liberalization and economic liberalization are really conflicting,&quot; says economist Koo Bon Ho.    The new forces have the technocrats running scared.    &quot;I'm refusing television appearances now,&quot; says Young Soo Gil, a pro-liberalization economist at the Korea Development Institute who has encountered protesting farmers' &quot;grenades&quot; one time too many. &quot;The problem is, there are no rules of the new game. We have growing interest groups now but no established institutions for their interaction.&quot;    Until last year, when Koreans took to the streets to demand democratic reforms, Korea's technocrats worked relatively undisturbed under the sponsorship of military-backed governments. A handful of specialists formulated an export-oriented economic strategy that emphasized highspeed growth and the development of large conglomerates rather than distributing the country's growing wealth.    Now, having obtained greater democracy, Koreans are demanding more for their labor. They want higher wages, shorter working hours, better health care and housing, more freedom to travel and invest abroad, less concentration of economic power in conglomerates, and less government intervention in the economy.    At the same time, Koreans, and particularly the three opposition parties that now hold a majority of seats in the National Assembly, are increasingly vocal in opposing government proposals and policies that they view as contrary to their interests. For instance, they want more protection from foreign farm imports and fewer taxpayer-funded corporate bailouts.    South Koreans are slowly coming to grips with the fact that they no longer live in an impoverished country but in a nation with an increasingly important international role. That change is best illustrated by South Korea's hosting of the 1988 Summer Olympics in September.    But a rising international profile also is bringing foreign pressures for economic reform. Many of the government policies and proposals that have attracted the public's ire have come in response to demands leveled by Washington. In an attempt to get South Korea to reduce its $9.5 billion trade surplus, the U.S. has pressed Seoul to lower barriers to imports of products such as beef and cigarettes and to allow the Korean currency, the won, to appreciate faster against the dollar.    Even in the face of popular demands for equitable growth and foreign pressure for trade liberalization, analysts agree the Korean economy isn't likely to be knocked off track. The Economic Planning Board projects 10% growth in gross national product this year despite an expected 15% appreciation of the won and wage increases averaging 15%. (GNP measures total output of goods and services.)    Moreover, despite vociferous disagreements on specific issues, there is widespread agreement that economic and business policies need to be reoriented. Both the opposition and the government have similar programs in areas like privatization of government-owned corporations and greater spending on housing.    &quot;There is a basic consensus on the economy,&quot; says Huh Kyung Man, the opposition chairman of the National Assembly's Commerce and Industry Committee.    &quot;This is the third year of our current-account surplus,&quot; Finance Minister Sakong Il says in an interview, &quot;so we have a cushion and can now pay more attention to issues of equity and distribution. (The current account measures trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers.)    President Roh Tae Woo set up a panel in April to recommend ways to reduce the trade surplus, boost domestic demand and restructure the economy to benefit consumers more. The panel is similar to a Japanese commission that two years ago produced a blueprint for restructuring Japan's economy.    Central to the process of rethinking economic policy are the demands of consumers. &quot;Japanese consumers were patient -- too patient, for too long,&quot; says Satoru Yanagisawa, general manager of the Seoul branch of Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. &quot;Koreans are different. They're more demanding.&quot;    South Koreans still work harder than almost any other people in the world; they average 54 hours a week on the job, with an average hourly wage of $2.30 an hour. Most workers who aren't employed by large corporations don't receive adequate health insurance or pensions.    At the same time, the standard of living has risen substantially in recent years -- especially since the newly obtained right to strike has gained many workers an average 30% wage hike over the last 18 months. Per capita income last year was $2,800.    In Seoul, private automobiles are now so common that new apartment buildings in some districts are being required by the government to provide two parking spaces per household. Live-in maids from the countryside, once common in upper-middle-class homes, are being replaced by washing machines and vacuum cleaners.    In response to public complaints, the government is reducing levies on luxuries: Washing machines are subject to a 28% tax instead of 40%; small cars are taxed at 10% instead of 15%.    Koreans as young as 30 years old are being allowed to travel abroad as tourists. They will even be permitted to spend as much as $5,000 on credit cards while overseas. That is a mind-boggling amount for people accustomed to years of scrimping on foreign exchange to pay off Korea's enormous foreign debt, a debt that has been shrinking for three years.    The new prosperity has yet to penetrate the whole country, however. Income in the countryside lags the city by 18%. Many Koreans have strong memories of poverty that lasted well into the 1970s. For example, the seaside village of Chollipo, only a few hours from the high-rise apartments of Seoul, didn't get electricity until 1976, and the first phone only last year.    Memories of shared poverty make the desire for even distribution of wealth very strong. Although South Korea enjoys one of the most even patterns of income distribution in the developing world, the perception is that large gaps exist, and resentment is strong.    The government is trying to take the offensive on social spending by proposing to invest $89.1 billion on housing by 1992, and by boosting expenditures on rural infrastructure to $4.14 billion in 1992 from $2.49 billion this year. In addition, it launched a national pension system this year, and next year medical insurance will be available to all.    Demands for wider ownership of stock are also being met. Plans to issue shares in government enterprises are being accelerated. In June, the government sold half of its stake in Pohang Iron andamp; Steel Co., the world's third-largest steel maker, with 75% of the shares reserved for people with monthly income below $825. Meanwhile, families that own large private corporations are being forced by the government to cede some of their control by issuing shares to the public.    What all these changes reflect is that the government -- and large corporations -- are being forced to step up their communication with the citizens, employees and shareholders of Korea.    &quot;The government can't act by itself. It must convince the people,&quot; says Suh Sang Mok, an economist turned politician. &quot;Now, no matter how good your ideas are, they're useless unless you have a consensus.&quot;    ---              South Korea: 1987 Economic Signposts Population                             42.1 million Exports                                $54.90 billion Imports                                $43.90 billion Nominal GDP                            $121.31 billion External Debt                          $35.50 billion Interest Payments as % of Exports      5.8%</TEXT></DOC>
