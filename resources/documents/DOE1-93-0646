There is a growingconsensus that efforts must be taken to protect the ozone layer. Theissue now is not whether chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) should be controlledand regulated but how much and how soon. The United States has urgedthat the production of dangerous CFCs, and any other chemicals that affectthe ozone layer, be restricted immediately to current levels and thattheir use be reduced 95 percent over the next decade. The American positionwas too strong for many European nations and the Japanese. Negotiationsat an international conference on the matter broke down. The breakdownis due in part to a more acute concern for environmental matters in theUnited States than exists in many countries. Meanwhile CFCs are linkedto another environmental problem that equally threatens the world - theGreenhouse Effect. The earth is in a natural warming period, but mancould be causing it to become even warmer. The Greenhouse Effect couldhave a catastrophic impact on mankind, although nothing has been provenyet.</TEXT></DOC>
