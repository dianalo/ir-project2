The &quot;victims&quot; had control of their lives while the good times rolled. They had a chance to save large amounts of disposable income, which many of them wasted. However, some realized the risk of their situation and remembered all those &quot;good grasshopper&quot; stories -- they'll have a chance for big bucks again.    The real victims of Wall Street are the workers of Middle America who lost their jobs in the past few years to mergers or cutbacks because some &quot;fast lane&quot; Wall Streeters wanted to squeeze a little more profit from the bottom line and get a little more for themselves. Tough break to have to fire the maid. But what about the maid?    These people are the real victims of greed -- one of the root causes for the stock-market crash of 1987. Your alleged victims have the resources to find other alternatives. The victims whom I mention have few options. My dictionary defines victim as &quot;one that is subjected to oppression, hardship or mistreatment.&quot; The subjects of your story were short-term losers, not victims of the guiding principles of Wall Street. The real victims make even the current losers real winners.    Ronald E. Boehm   West Lebanon, N.H. </TEXT></DOC>
