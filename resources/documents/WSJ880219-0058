The group is one of several businesses Southland earlier said it would sell to help finance its $4.9 billion leveraged buy-out, completed in December, by an investment firm controlled by Southland's founding family, the Thompsons. In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company.    The division includes 10 regional dairies throughout the country, comprising 25 plants and related distribution points. MorningStar said that it will continue to operate the dairies under their brand names and that it plans to retain current employees. </TEXT></DOC>
