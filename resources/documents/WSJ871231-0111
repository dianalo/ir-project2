The Tokyo, Manila and Taipei exchanges were closed.    In London, recovering from Tuesday's biggest one-day drop in a month, stocks finished higher, near the day's peak, boosted by a steadier dollar in currency dealings and an early Wall Street turnaround.    The Financial Times 30-share index closed up 25.7 points at 1408.0. Volume was a modest 301.3 million shares, down slightly from 309.6 million shares a day earlier. The 100-share index was up 29.5 points at 1759.8.    Dealers said the market rose gradually throughout the day as participants were reassured by the dollar's steadiness. The dollar's slide earlier in the week caused the 100-share index to slump 60.8 points Tuesday. The dollar was supported again Wednesday by reports of intervention by several European central banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve.    Most movement in share prices resulted from market makers pushing up their prices or squaring their books before year end, dealers said.    Trading in British Petroleum partly paid shares accounted for about one-fourth of the day's total trading volume. Turnover in BP shares, which counts both the buy and sell side of each transaction, was 77 million. The heavy trading volume prompted speculation that the Kuwait Investment Office was still buying BP shares, building on its previously disclosed 17.4% stake in BP. BP new shares were up a half-penny at 70.5 pence ($1.39). BP regular shares rose 7 to 257.    Britoil was up 2 at 437. Market sources said Atlantic Richfield Co. bought Britoil shares on the open market, building on its 21.12% stake in Britoil.    The dollar's steadiness helped major dollar-earning U.K. companies, with Imperial Chemical Industries up 12 pence at #11.24 ($20.94), Glaxo Holdings up 6 at 10.10 and Jaguar up 6 at 329.    Bank shares rose strongly in reaction to the plan announced Tuesday under which Mexico will offer to swap as much as $10 billion in bonds backed by the U.S. government for part of its commercial bank debt. The gains mirrored similar advances by leading U.S. banks in New York, even though U.K. banks aren't as heavily exposed to Mexico. But dealers said the plan prompted more optimism about the general Latin American debt situation.    Barclays was up 11 at 465, Lloyds rose 11 to 260 and Midland was up 12 at 395.    An official said the London stock exchange is considering easing its requirements for stocks to attain alpha status, the trading category for Britain's biggest stocks, to compensate for the sharp drop in market capitalizations following the Oct. 19 stock market crash. Alphas are the biggest and most visibly traded British stocks, and carry the most stringent market making and reporting requirements for securities firms. The exchange now has 129 alpha stocks, including the constituents of the 100-share index.    Because of the crash, the market capitalizations of a number of alphas have dropped below #600 million ($1.12 billion), the minimum required by the exchange, which may be lowered. In early January, exchange officials will review the the capitalization requirement and could reduce it perhaps 15% to 20%, the official said, adding that they also may review the requirement that alpha stocks generate turnover of at least #100 million every three months. Stock exchange volume also has dropped significantly in recent weeks.    In Frankfurt, share prices ended mixed in quiet dealings on the last day of trading in 1987.    Major international blue chips showed a slight upward trend by the end of trading, after heavy intervention by international central banks drove the dollar higher overnight. But other big stocks remained depressed in the pre-holiday lull, so that the market remained trendless overall.    &quot;There's a guarded optimism for the new year,&quot; a West German analyst said, but noted that West German equities remain hostage to the dollar, which rose slightly in Frankfurt dealings.    Among bank stocks, Dresdner Bank advanced 8.50 marks to 232 marks ($145.53), while Deutsche Bank was up 1.50 at 388 and Commerzbank gained 1 to 214.    In the electrical sector, AEG was up 3.20 at 190.20 and Siemens added 2.20 to 359. Chemical stock BASF gained 3.50 to 255.50, and Bayer rose 1.60 to 263.80. But Hoechst eased 0.50 to 250. Schering gained 13.50 to 353.    Among auto stocks, Volkswagen rose 6.30 to 224.50, while Bayerische Motoren Werke eased 4 to 447 and Daimler-Benz fell 1 to 575. Among machinery shares, Linde gained 19 to 522. But Kloeckner Humboldt Deutz eased 2.10 to 81. MAN fell 0.30 to 139.    Elsewhere in Europe, share prices closed higher in Stockholm and Milan; mixed in Zurich, Brussels and Amsterdam; and lower in Paris.    Observers in Paris said Wall Street's weaker tone Tuesday and concern that financial markets could begin 1988 on a downbeat note kept buyers on the sidelines. But in Stockholm, prices rose as participants reacted to a steadier dollar and as some investors bought stock to take advantage of the last trading day of the year. In Milan, concerted central bank intervention to support the dollar helped restore investor confidence. In Amsterdam, Brussels and Zurich, it also was the last 1987 trading day. Many bourses don't reopen until Monday.    Stocks closed lower in Sydney and Hong Kong, were little changed in Wellington, and higher in Singapore.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                       % This                                   Dec 29    Dec 28    Year    U.S. .......................... 227.2     228.1   -  0.3    Britain ....................... 520.3     538.9   +  4.6    Canada ........................ 350.3     351.4   +  5.1    Japan ........................ 1022.3    1022.3   +  8.2    France ........................ 291.1     292.4   - 28.7    Germany ....................... 155.0     158.2   - 40.4    Hong Kong .................... 1643.9    1632.8   -  7.6    Switzerland ................... 140.0     140.9   - 30.3    Australia ..................... 255.7     257.6   -  3.1    World index ................... 402.8     406.4   + 12.9</TEXT></DOC>
