The Cactus Club, downtownSan Jose's rock 'n' roll flagship, is a good example of what happens whenpeople try to fit big ideas into small rooms.;    The 225-capacity club,housed in what formerly was the Bachelor Club adult theater, is like arestaurant that opens with an ambitious menu of nouvelle cuisine only to findthat it's more profitable -- and popular -- to sell pizza and beer. When MikeTrippett and Sean Galvin (the two bright twentysomethings behind thelegendary, short-lived Muzzie's club scene) opened the Cactus in '88, theycame out of the gate blazing with big-ticket prestige acts such as Joe Ely,the Dead Milkmen, Faith No More and Graham Parker.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  METAL AND MEDIOCRITYMEET IN A SMALL ROOM  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Cactus Club417 S.

Before long,instead of bidding against much larger halls for expensive national acts, theclub was dishing out a regular schedule of trash heavy metal and mediocrelocal garage bands. Of course, this music had all the subtlety and artisticmerit of a cinder-block brick -- but it sold. While neighboring clubslanguished, the line of teen and post-teen metalheads waiting to get into theCactus often stretched down the block. There were so many disaffected,Spandex-clad young men packing bad attitudes and big cans of hair spray thatone errant Bic lighter could have set off a shag-head firestorm.;    Latelythe Cactus has shown signs of tempering its junk-food habit with a morebalanced menu of quality roots-rock and collegiate acts. This month's slateincluded major names such as the Paladins, the Blasters and Mojo Nixon. Wewere curious to see if the old coterie of collegiate hipsters and alternativerockers who used to roost at Muzzie's and One Step Beyond could still be foundat the Cactus. On a recent Wednesday night the old guard -- perhaps 100 strong-- turned out for a gig by Seattle's Young Fresh Fellows, a typical collegiateclub band.;    At 11 p.m., a great, totally unheralded local quintet calledBed of Thorns was tearing up the club's small stage with a frenetic set ofEnglish Beat-style ska and funk. Any band that can take War's &quot;Low Rider&quot; andspeed it up to Warp Nine is OK in my book.;    This still is my favorite placedowntown to see a show. The U-shaped, brick-walled club actually looks betternow than it did when it opened. Decor is still minimalist-chic, with fewbreakable objects.;    Some of the brick walls that were once black are nowwhitewashed and one has a Lewis Carroll-inspired mural and poem on it. There'snow a dinosaur suspended above the beer bar and a black &quot;DOA&quot; flag big enoughto cover a Winnebago tacked to the rafters. The terra-cotta ceiling-to-floorwaterfall that came with the building is still dry. The back portion of thedance floor is now fenced off, with high stools, cocktail tables and smallspotlights. In a venue where the dance floor used to resemble an unofficiatedrugby scree, this strikes me as being downright genteel.;    At 11:45, theYoung Fresh Fellows took the stage, singing, &quot;We'll be better than theBeatles, better than the Stones, better than Guns N' Roses, duuuuuude.&quot; Well,one out of three . . . duude. The casual shorts-and-T-shirts crowd that hadbeen cuttin' the rug for Bed of Thorns moved forward toward the stage but didnot dance. They'd probably seen four dozen similar college-radio bands thatcould be called &quot;zany&quot; or &quot;wacky&quot; in the past year and they were not easilyimpressed by a group that was a sonic throwback to the &quot;new wave&quot; era 10 yearsgone.;    There were a handful of notable efforts -- the party anthem &quot;BeerMoney,&quot; a thrash-funk ditty called &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Pest Control&quot; and a MotleyCrue-meets-Walt Disney version of &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah.&quot;;    I honestly believethat even a mediocre alternative-rock show is preferable to the vast majorityof heavy metal out there. But on this particular night, the gap between thetwo schools was not all that wide.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  David Plotnikoff Music Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910719  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  18  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  738  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday July 19, 199100201124,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
