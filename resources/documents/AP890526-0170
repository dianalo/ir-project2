The legislation gives homosexual couples the same rights as in aconventional marriage regarding inheritance, taxation, joint rightsto pensions and property ownership.   Gay couples, however, are not permitted to adopt children.   ``Two persons of the same sex can let their partnership beregistered,'' said Article 1 of the bill, in what amounted to apermission for a civil marriage.   At least one partner must be a Danish citizen. Unlike in aconventional marriage, the non-Danish partner would not be entitledto citizenship as a consequence of marrying a Dane.   Denmark legalized homosexuality in 1930 and has had an activegay rights movement since 1948. Authorities estimate about 20,000homosexuals cohabit in this country of 5.1 million people.   The law was designed to give homosexual couples greater socialacceptibility. Proponents hoped the move would encourage couples tostay together longer and discourage promiscuity, which they saidincreases the danger of contracting AIDS.   The bill was proposed by the leftist opposition but breezedthrough with the support of Prime Minister Poul Schlueter'sminority centrist coalition.   Parliament members who objected were asked to abstain to ensureeasy passage. The small Christian Peoples Party was the mainopponent of the bill.</TEXT></DOC>
