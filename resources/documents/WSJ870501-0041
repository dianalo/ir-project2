How crowded was it?    --CBOT Chairman Karsten Mahlmann and President Thomas R. Donovan gave pre-trading speeches, and no one heard them.    --Once trading began at 7 p.m. EDT, security guards had to prop up several brokers' assistants to keep them from being pushed from the rim of the jammed bond futures pit.    --A half hour later, Roger Rutz, president of the Board of Trade Clearing Corp., told some brokerages to start entering their own trades into the computer system. Mr. Rutz feared that the clearing firm couldn't keep up on its own.    Last night's session marked the apparently successful start of an effort by the nation's largest futures exchange to establish busy, liquid markets in the evening for Treasury bond and Treasury note futures, along with options on those contracts. Mr. Rutz put the total volume in all four contracts in the first 1 1/2 hours of trading at 30,000 -- better than many expected.    By the session's end, activity had slowed. Prices, though, were above their afternoon close.    The larger question of whether the orders and traders will remain after the excitement wears off won't be answered for weeks or months. But CBOT officials weren't worried about that last night.    &quot;We know we're in competitive battle,&quot; said Jack Kinsella, president of a local brokerage and one of the planners of the evening sessions. &quot;This exchange wants to keep the business here.&quot;    The evening hours -- from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. EDT Monday through Thursday -- are intended to coincide with morning trading of U.S. Treasury bonds and notes in the Far East. The goal is to grab a bigger chunk of foreign business, particularly from Japan.    CBOT officials had prepared for the evening session by talking it up in recent trips to the Far East and to New York. But fortune also played a part in last night's brisk business.    Jitters about the dollar, inflation and interest rates have fueled volatile and heavy trading in the past few weeks. In yesterday's daytime session from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. EDT, the turnover in bond futures was estimated at 500,000 contracts. That is a record if it stands up in the final tally later today.    &quot;For a futures market to exist, you need volatility,&quot; said Mr. Mahlmann, noting that sharp price changes move hedgers to use futures to limit their risk in the cash markets.    Motioning to the bond futures pit, where more than 500 traders and their assistants jostled for position, Mr. Mahlmann added: &quot;As volatility picks up, you have an incentive to have this.&quot;    One of the jostlers was Gregory G. Schwerin, a 31-year-old independent trader who is giving day and night trading a shot.    &quot;I'm going to try and see how my endurance is,&quot; he said, fresh from a nap and a dinner of chopped steak and fries. &quot;I don't think a lot of these people will be trading six hours in the day and three at night. It takes physical and mental endurance.&quot;    Why was Mr. Schwerin enduring both sessions? &quot;Because I want to make money,&quot; he said just before the start of the first evening session on a U.S. exchange. &quot;And because we're making history today.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
