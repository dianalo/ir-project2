In thermonuclear plasmas,the instability typically results in a 20% reduction in emission. Thetime evolution of the thermonuclear neutron signal suggests that thesawtooth crash consists of four phases. First, the electron density profileflattens rapidly (in {approximately}30{mu}sec on PLT) but, in some cases,there is little associated change in neutron emission, suggesting thatmost reacting ions remain confined in the sawtooth region but do notcompletely mix. After the electron sawtooth, the ions continue to mix,resulting in a {approximately}10% reduction in neutron emission in {approximately}0.5msec. The emission then decays more slowly during the final two phases.Thermalization of reacting ions on a {approximately}3{tau}{sub ii} timescale accounts for only {approximately}20% of the slow drop. Most ofthe slow drop seems to be caused by loss of ion energy from the mixingregion (an ion heat pulse). 36 refs., 15 figs., 1 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
