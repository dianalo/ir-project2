Explanation of BPA's Revised Draft Long Term Intertie AccessPolicy</ITAG>IntroductionThe proposed Long Term Intertie Access Policy (``LTIAP'' or ``1988 draft'')included in this document reflects major changes in direction on provisionsdefining Assured Delivery, Formula Allocation, and Fish and Wildlife protection.The changes are intended to serve two primary purposes. First, the LTIAPas revised is designed to provide greater specificity to give utilitiesin the Northwest and California greater planning certainty. Second, theLTIAP as revised is designed to provide more revenue protection for BPA,while providing Assured Delivery for a wider variety of transactions thanthe 1986 draft LTIAP.This narrative summarizes the issues raised by the proposed LTIAP and thecurrent revision. Appendices containing more detailed information and examplesfollow the narrative. The revised LTIAP is presented for public comment,which BPA will consider in developing the final Long Term Intertie AccessPolicy in April 1988.<T3>Assured Delivery.</T3> To address the needs of Northwest utilitiesand to protect BPA's revenue recovery, BPA has determined an amount ofcapacity for Assured Delivery transactions that will include an amountfor Firm Sales based on a utility's Average Firm Surplus as computed ineach utility's Exhibit B to the LTIAP. The amount includes 105 megawattsfor Montana Power Company pursuant to section 9(i)(3) of the NorthwestPower Act. An amount also will be set aside for Seasonal Exchanges. Provisionsfor capacity contracts and capacity-energy exchanges have been deletedbecause little interest has been expressed regarding these transactions.<T3>Formula Allocation.</T3> Allocating access under Condition 1 basedon the size of the California market is the major change BPAS made to theFormula Allocation proposal. This change responds to analyses BPA conductedof the impacts on BPA under Condition 1 of allocating to the availableIntertie capacity versus allocating to the identified market. BPA wouldlose $16 million annually by allocating to Intertie Capacity rather thanto the market.<T3>Fish and Wildlife Protection.</T3> BPA included fish and wildlife provisionsin the 1988 draft LTIAP to protect BPA's investments in facilities to protect,mitigate, and enhance fish and wildlife. The revised provisions reducea utility's access to the Intertie for any new hydroelectric projects developedwithin ``Protected Areas.'' The provisions also will apply to existingprojects in Protected Areas as their licenses expire.BPA will rely on intervention in Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hydrolicensing proceedings under the Federal Power Act to resolve problems associatedwith its fish and widlife investments which may arise from existing projectsprior to expiration of their licenses.<ITAG tagnum="81">I. Assured Delivery</ITAG><T3>Amount.</T3> The 1988 draft policy determines an Assured Delivery maximumon the basis of both Northwest utility system operations and revenue impactson BPA. In contrast to 1986 draft LTIAP which provided 420 MW for firmpower sales only, BPA is now accommodating Seasonal Exchanges as well asfirm power sales by providing 800 MW of Assured Delivery service. The figureof 800 MW is the approximate sum of Exhibit B firm energy surpluses forlisted Scheduling Utilities (361 MW) \1\<NOTE/> and an estimate of surplus summertime Firm Energy Load CarryingCapability (FELCC) that can be generated by the same utilities (440 MW).This amount of Assured Delivery has a deleterious, but tolerable, effectof $14 million on BPA annual revenues. Later in this document, we discussproposed mitigation measures that help contain these revenue effects.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ This figure is the 1988-89 Pacific Northwest Utility ConferenceCommittee estimated firm energy surplus, plus an additional amount madeavailable to Montana Power Company in proposed settlement of any obligationunder Northwest Power Act section 9(i)(3). See Exhibit B.The summertime FELCC estimate is still subject to debate. Seasonal Exchangescould reduce the need for capacity additions in both the Northwest andthe Southwest. However, BPA is concerned about the availability of FELCCfor the critical month of August when the Northwest faces hydro operationproblems. A strategy of using Seasonal Exchanges to defer Northwest capacityadditions for wintertime loads could backfire if it resulted in a needfor new firm resources in August. Seasonal Exchanges should not be allowedbeyond the point where they begin to have negative effects on Northwestcoordinated system operations. The definition of Seasonal Exchanges, appearingon page 3 of the 1988 revised draft policy, reflects these operationalconcerns.To the extent ongoing studies demonstrate that 440 MW is too high an estimateof summertime surplus FELCC, the Assured Delivery maximum will be reducedin the final policy. However, if we have underestimated summertime FELCC,BPA revenue impacts may constrain may increase in the Assured Deliverymaximum unless more rigorous mitigation measures are adopted.Ideally, the final policy will include a set of firm energy surplus andsummertime surplus FELCC numbers for each utility which reasonably balanceBPA's revenue concerns with that utility's desire to exchange its summersurplus. Then, there would be little need for rationing provisions, describedbelow, and utilities might not feel a need to conclude transactions quicklyunder the pressure of a first-come first-served policy.However, to the extent revenue concerns cause BPA to limit Assured Deliveryto an amount less than the combined total of firm sales and Seasonal Exchangesallowed on a utility by utility basis, some form of rationing would berequired. Although no rationing provision is included in the 1987 reviseddraft, the final policy may contain such a provision.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The final policy may contain rationing provisions likethe following:<ITAG tagnum="28">``If timely requests for Assured Delivery exceed the maximum amountsspecified in section 4(d), BPA will ration available capacity. AssuredDelivery will be made available to Scheduling Utilities that meet all conditionsfor Assured Delivery and lack transmission interconnections with the Southwest,according to the following priorities:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(i) existing BPA firm transmission contracts for their remaining term,:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(ii) transactions involving section 9(i)(3) resources,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(iii) Seasonal Exchanges, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(iv) firm power sales.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">``For a given priority, if there is insufficient capacity availableto satisfy all requests, each request will be reduced pro rata. No requestin any lower priority will be satisfied. Once a request has been satisfied,in whole or part, with an Assured Delivery contract, that contract becomesan ``existing BPA firm transmission contract'' for purposes of determiningpriorities in any subsequent rationing exercise. After assured Deliveryhas been made available to Scheduling Utilities lacking Southwest interconnections,any remainder will be made available for Exhibit B transactions of utilitiesthat come within the limitation of section 4(a).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">``If Assured Delivery capacity is insufficient to satisfy demandsof Scheduling Utilities for Seasonal Exchanges, BPA may offer to substituteitself for a Southwest utility and perform the Seasonal Exchange with theScheduling Utility.''</ITAG><T3>Other Firm Sale Provisions. </T3>A utility may increase its ExhibitB amount by purchasing surplus firm power either from another regionalutility (which would reduce the selling utility's exhibit B amount) orfrom BPA. BPA may adjust a utility's Exhibit B amount to reflect a reductionin the utility's firm surplus power and may revoke any uncommitted AssuredDelivery amount. <T3>See </T3>section 4(d)(2)(B)(ii). The definition of Qualified NorthwestResources includes new resources that are necessary to support sales receivingAssured Delivery service. To allow for maximum use of the Intertie, section 4(d)(2)(C) permits autility granted Assured Delivery to shape its firm power sale into themonths of September through December by delivering up to 1.8 times itsExhibit B amount. During those fall months, spot market energy sales tothe Southwest tend to be less than in the spring when the region's hydroelectricdams are more often near or in a spilling condition. If a utility shapesAssured Delivery energy into the fall, less firm energy may be shaped intoremaining months of the operating year so that the total energy delivereddoes not exceed its annual Exhibit B energy maximum for firm sales. <T3>Additional Assured Delivery. </T3>BPA concerns about the adverse revenueeffects of Assured Delivery is lessened when the transaction involves ajoint venture between itself and another utility. Section 4(c) of the 1988draft imposes no capacity limits on Assured Delivery for transactions inwhich BPA is able to increase sales of its surplus firm power through transactionswith other sellers. Assured Delivery for these types of joint sale transactionswould not be rationed, even if limits were placed on transactions whichdid not include BPA as a seller. One type of joint venture is the firm displacement sale in which a BPAsale of firm power displaces a Northwest generating utility's generatingresources for sale to the Southwest. Another possible transaction, on whichBPA invites comment, is a sale in lieu of exchange (section 4(c)(2)) inwhich BPA would use its winter surplus to satisfy Northwest seasonal powerrequirements. The list of possible joint ventures is not intended to be exhaustive. Thisprovision of the policy holds potential promise for utilities like MontanaPower Company, which has surplus firm power in excess of its Exhibit Bamount. <T3>Mitigation. </T3>The 1986 draft LTIAP made MW of Assured Delivery serviceavailable to Northwest Scheduling Utilities with firm surpluses. The policyobjective underlying this proposal was BPA's desire to assist Northwestutilities in disposing of their surpluses through long-term firm powersales to the Southwest. Assured Delivery was to be made available withoutregard to any adverse impact on BPA's ability to sell firm power or nonfirmenergy to the same Southwest utilities. We now believe that there is agreater demand in the Northwest for Assured Delivery to facilitate SeasonalExchanges than for firm power sales. In a major change of policy proposals,BPA is now proposing to accommodate Seasonal Exchanges and firm sales ina manner that reduces adverse revenue impacts on the agency.Mitigation refers to conditions imposed on a utility for an Assured Deliverycontract. Intertie Capacity not available to BPA because of Assured Deliverycontracts executed between a Northwest utility and a Soutwest utility reducesBPA revenues and can inhibit BPA's ability to make its Treasury payments.During the operating year BPA often has power available to load the Intertiefully. Assured Delivery granted under these circumstances would reduceBPA's revenues. BPA recognizes the interest of utilities in gaining firmaccess to the Intertie. BPA is not willing, however, to jeopardize itsfiscal responsibilities to the Treasury.The first mitigation measure, contained in section 4(d)(4)(A), is to requirethat during any hour in which prescheduled energy sales are made underCondition 1 Formula Allocation procedures, a utility must deduct its AssuredDelivery amount from its Formula Allocation amount. The total amount ofIntertie access granted to each utility is equal to its Condition 1 formulaallocation. If a utility's Assured Delivery amount is greater than itsFormula Allocation, then that utility must purchase enough energy fromBPA to make up the difference. BPA believes that this mitigation measurewill partially offset the spot market revenues BPA will lose by grantingAssured Delivery. The measure is based on comments received on the 1986draft LTIAP.The second mitigation measure, contained in section 4(d)(4)(B), focuseson Seasonal Exchanges by requiring all energy returns at prescheduled levels(South-to-North counterscheduling on the Intertie) be delivered to thepoint of interconnection with the Northwest at either the California-Oregonborder or the Nevada-Oregon border. Furthermore, if BPA has invoked Condition1 or Condition 2 Formula Allocations, cash out provisions \3\<NOTE/> of Seasonal Exchange contracts become inoperative. This mitigationmeasure has the effect of increasing the North-to-South capability of theIntertie during Conditions 1 and 2 when energy is being returned and increasingthe size of the market for BPA and Scheduling Utility sales.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Cash out provisions of Seasonal Exchange contracts allowa Northwest utility to accept dollar payments from a Southwest utilityin lieu of actual energy returns.These mitigation measures especially tend to reduce the adverse revenueimpacts of Seasonal Exchanges on BPA and are critical to our decision toprovide Assured Delivery for such transactions.<ITAG tagnum="81">II. Formula Allocation</ITAG>The 1988 draft policy continues the Formula Allocation methodology usedin the Near Term Intertie Access Policy (NTIAP) of allocating adcess tothe Intertie based on three possible conditions. Provisions for Condition1 reflect the expiration of the Exportable Agreement at the end of 1988,the public comment received on the 1986 draft LTIAP, and the analyses completedby BPA.In section 5(a) of the 1988 draft, BPA continues the special limitationon Formula Allocations when necessary to protect fish and wildlife. Thisprovision was originally included in the 1986 draft LTIAP to address situationswhen BPA may wish to provide flows above those allowed under its own hourlyallocation in order to address a specific fishery concern. or example onVernita Bar, in the Hanford reach of the Columbia, BPA and several publicutility districts are arranging, under specified circumstances, to provideincreased flows between December and April to protect hatching and emergingfall chinook. Without increased flows, some redds (egg nests) would beleft uncovered when flows are reduced to reflect lower demand for electricity.Section 5(a) allows BPA to market the additional electricity produced asa result of the flows BPA may provide to protect fish and wildlife.Condition 1Condition 1 under the NTIAP incorporated the pre-existing Exportable Agreement,which expires on December 31, 1988. Parties to the Agreement declare amountsof exportable energy_surplus energy available for export at the applicableBPA rate. If total declarations of exportable energy exceeds the availableIntertie Capacity or the size of the Pacific Southwest market, whicheveris smaller, each party to the Agreement is allocated access to the amalleramount based on its share of total declarations.The 1986 draft LTIAP proposed that upon expiration of the Exportable Agreementa condition of spill or likelihood of spill on the Federal Columbia Riverpower system would trigger Condition 1. BPA and Northwest scheduling utilitiescould declare surplus energy available for export and BPA would allocateaccess to the Intertie by approximating the ratio of each declaration tothe sum of all declarations multiplied by the available Intertie Capacity.Each Scheduling Utility's allocation would be limited by the ratio of itsregional hydroelectric capacity to the total regional hydroelectric capacityof the Scheduling Utilities multiplied by the total of all declarations(the ``Hydro Cap'').Subsequent to releasing the 1986 draft LTIAP for public review, BPA receivedand considered many comments and suggestions for allocation under Condition1. The majority of respondents either favored continuing the provisionsof the Exportable Agreement by negotiating a new agreement or implementinga similar Condition 1 allocation policy. The comments identified the ExportableAgreement as an equitable means of allocating access to the Intertie. Othersrecommended that the Exportable Agreement be allowed to terminate afterDecember 31, 1988, and a similar agreement not be negotiated. A few commenterssuggested that Condition 1 be eliminated upon expiration of the ExportableAgreement, identifying Condition 2 as an equitable means to allocate accessto the Intertie. One commenter suggested that BPA pursue a policy whereinBPA would receive an allocation sufficient to market its surplus energyand allow access to others scheduling utilities on a first-come first-servedbasis.The 1988 draft now incorporates provisions from both the Exportable Agreementand the 1986 draft LTIAP for allocation under Condition 1. A conditionof spill or likelihood of spill on the Federal Columbia River Power Systemwill determine Condition 1. In Condition1, BPA must be especially concernedwith protecting its own sales, because sales foregone during spill conditionscannot be stored and made later. BPA and Scheduling Utilities will declaresurplus energy available for export at the applicable BPA rate and receivea share of available Intertie Capacity approximating the ratio of eachScheduling Utilitiy's hydroelectric capacity to the region's hydroelectriccapacity multiplied by the quantity of available Intertie Capacity. Tothe extent that the market for Pacific Northwest energy at BPA's priceis less than the available Intertie Capacity, BPA will allocate accessto the Intertie to equal that market. Once a utility receives an allocationit is free to negotiate a sale with any purchaser.BPA believes that once the Exportable Agreement expires, these provisionsfor Condition 1 will balance BPA's long-term objectives of: (1) Managingthe Intertie in a manner that provides sufficient access for BPA to marketits surplus energy and ensures its ability to meet its financial obligations,including repayment to the Treasury; and (2) providing Intertie accessfor the region's scheduling utilities to market surplus electricity.<T3>Allocating To The Market.</T3> Allocating access under Condition 1based on the size of the Southwest market, as under the Exportable Agreement,constitutes the major change BPA made from the 1986 draft LTIAP FormulaAllocation proposal. This change comes in response to analyses identifyingthe impacts on BPA under Condition 1 of allocating to the available IntertieCapacity or to the identified market. Appendix A shows an example of thedifference in transmission capacity for BPA between allocating to the marketor the Intertie.The market for power in California is often less than available Intertiecapacity because of minimum generation requirements. As the Intertie isexpanded and Southwest utilities bring on new generation that cannot bedisplaced with spot market purchases, the frequency of this situation isexpected to grow.The heart of BPA's revenue problem in this situation is the Northwest RegionalPreference Act, 16 U.S.C. 837, <T3>et seq</T3>., which requires BPA to quote an energy price to Northwestutilities before making any sale to the Southwest. This creates a problemin which Northwest utilities, which are both BPA's customers and competitors,know BPA's price but we do not know theirs. In the Condition 1 situationwhere the size of the Southwest market is less than available IntertieCapacity, Northwest utilities are able to use this information to undercutthe BPA price and use their allocations to reduce BPA hourly sales to asmall Southwest market. If a ``real time'' BPA pricing iteration were evenpossible, BPA would still be required to announce its new price to theNorthwest. Regional preference makes BPA a ``sitting duck'' for its competitors.Allocating according to market size reduces BPA's vulnerability by reducingthe size of Scheduling Utility allocations.In reviewing the allocation procedure, BPA set out to determine the revenueimpacts of allocating Condition 1 access to the market or to the size ofthe available Intertie Capacity. Analyses indicate that BPA would loseapproximately $16.4 million in 1989 by allocating to the Intertie ratherthan the market. This loss would decrease to $10.7 million in fiscal year1992. Beyond 1992 the difference would increase, mainly due to projectedfuel price increases.Allocation to the market will not necessarily cause the Intertie to gounloaded. Purchasers with low decremental costs may choose to displacethose resources with additional energy purchased at BPA's market expansionrates after the first allocations are made.<T3>The Hydro Cap. </T3>BPA received comment on the provision to allocateto a Scheduling Utility based on its hydroelectric capacity (``Hydro Cap'').Allocating access to the Intertie based on a utility's hydroelectric capacityis consistent with the definition of Condition 1. When the Federal ColumbiaRiver power system is spilling or likely to spill, the maximum allocationto utilities with greater hydroelectric resources increases, thus decreasingthe probability of wasting the resources by spilling. Under this provision,BPA's share of allocations would tend to increase due to its large hydroelectriccapacity. BPA believes this will contribute to proper management of theColumbia River system and to efficient use of the region's resources. Thespecific wording for the provision has been changed from the 1986 draftLTIAP to reflect the allocation procedure more accurately.The Hydro Cap is also a necessary element of Assured Delivery mitigationprovisions and the Protected Area program, described below. Hydro Cap numbersgive BPA and scheduling utilities a predictable, practical way of anticipatingthe amount of energy to be purchased under Condition 1 mitigation provisions(policy section 4(d)(4)(A)). Also, Hydro Caps appear to be the only practicalway in which BPA can enforce the prohibition against hydroelectric developmentin Protected Areas (policy section 7(c)).Conditions 2 and 3Conditions 2 and 3 are similar to those in the NTIAP and the 1986 draftLTIAP. Under Condition 2, when Condition 1 is not in effect and BPA andScheduling Utilities declare amounts of surplus energy available for saleson the Intertie that exceed the available Intertie Capacity, a utility'sallocation will approximate the ratio of its declaration to the sum ofall declarations multiplied by the available Intertie Capacity.Under Condition 3, when Condition 1 is not in effect and when the totalsurplus energy declared available by BPA and Scheduling Utilities is lessthan the total available Intertie Capacity, BPA's and Scheduling Utilities'allocations will equal their declarations. The remaining available Intertiecapacity will be offered to extraregional utilities.Policy Section 5(d)BPA believes that there are sound justifications for pro rata allocationof Intertie capacity among Northwest sellers of surplus energy, which wedescribe below. However, section 5(d) of the 1988 draft proposes to endCondition 2 and 3 pro rata allocations for nonfederal utilities when thethird AC Intertie expansion is completed, provided anticompetitive problemsin the Southwest are cured by that time. BPA will explore the practicalityof this proposal during the public process on the 1988 draft policy.<T3>Revenue Justification.</T3> Anyone who has participated in a BPA ratecase knows that the Northwest Power Act ties BPA's revenues and costs tothe revenues and costs of Northwest utilities. Actions that depress utilityrevenues tend to reduce BPA revenues or increase BPA costs. This is a majorconcern for BPA, which lost $199 million in fiscal 1987 and $65 millionin fiscal 1986.The first concern relates to scheduling utilities that annually receive$160 million in residential exchange subsidies under Northwest Power Actsection 5(c). <T3>See Pacificorp </T3>v. <T3>FERC, </T3>795 F.2d 816 (9th Cir. 1986). Surplus energy sales are usedas a credit in calculating a subsidy recipient's ``average system cost''(ASC). A change in formula allocation procedures that reduces the revenuesof exchanging utilities lowers the ASC credits and increases the subsidiespaid by BPA.The second concern relates to scheduling utilities which purchase someof their power requirements as preference customers of BPA. A change informula allocation procedures that reduces the sales of BPA preferencecustomers causes the latter to displace purchases from BPA with their ownunsold energy. The so-called ``availability charge'' has been an incompleteand very controversial remedy to this displacement problem even after BPA'sadoption of the charge was upheld in <T3>City of </T3><T3>Seattle </T3>v. <T3>Johnson, </T3>813 F.2d 1364 (9th Cir. 1987). Two more challenges tothe availability charge are now pending before the court.<T3>Antitrust Concerns. </T3>BPA records of decisions on earlier versionsof the IAP speak to the problems of California utility market concentrationand the resulting anticompetitive burdens placed on utilities that lackownership interests in the southern portion of the Intertie. Certainlyno California utility has an Intertie policy that provides anything nearthe access given by BPA.Judge Norris' dissent in <T3>CEC v. BPA </T3>suggests that a remedy may be had through a treble-damageantitrust action against California Intertie owners. <T3>California Energy Commission v. BPA, </T3>Ninth Cir. Nos 84-7836, etal. (slip op. at 25, November 6, 1987). However, this course of actionseems terribly impractical. Fifteen years after the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission initiated an investigation of anticompetitive transmission restrictionsby California Intertie owners and four years after Administrative Law JudgeHowe found the existence of anticompetitive problems, the case still awaitsresolution and no remedies have been put into effect. <T3>Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Company, </T3>FERC Docket No. E-7777. Wedo not believe that a district court treble damage action would move toany quicker resolution. BPA cannot wait 14 years for a cure to problemsin its critical California market when BPA's average losses run to $100million per year.   BPA's response is to put California concerns about competition to a test.When the third AC interconnection goes into commercial operation, the marketpower of existing California Intertie owners should be reduced becauseother California utilities will gain the access now denied them becauseof the absence of any California Intertie access policy. BPA seeks publiccomment on a proposal to cease allocating individual Intertie capacityamounts to non-Federal utilities during Conditions 2 and 3 after commercialoperation of the third AC Intertie. However, this provision would not beoperative if the Administrator determines that: <ITAG tagnum="21">(1) even after commercial operation of the third AC, Intertie accesscontinues to be impaired for California utilities presently lacking ownershipin the southern portion of the Intertie, or   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Southwest utilities utilize some pro rata scheme to allocate energypurchases over the Intertie. </ITAG>Formula allocations would continue for Condition 1 because they are necessaryto enforce Assured Delivery mitigation measures and the 1988 draft policy'sProtected Area program. <T3>See </T3>page 12, above.   During the remaining course of this proceeding, BPA is particularly concernedabout quantifying any adverse impact on BPA revenues that might be associatedwith adoption of section 5(d).   Alternatively, commenters are encouraged to address the question of whethersection 5(d) might be implemented sooner. Anyone commenting on this optionshould also address ways in which BPA might resolve its revenue and Californiatransmission problems.   <ITAG tagnum="81">III. Fish and Wildlife Protection   </ITAG>``<T3>Protected Areas.</T3>'' BPA would prohibit Intertie access for newhydroelectric projects licensed within ``Protected Areas,'' which are designatedriver reaches withdrawn from hydro development due to the presence of anadromousor high value resident fish, or wildlife. BPA also has designated areaswhere we have determined that investments in habitat, hatchery, passage,or other projects may result in the presence of anadromous fish. The NorthwestPower Planning Council (Council) is developing a Protected Area programthat may cover the entire Northwest. However, BPA's Protected Area designationswould cover only the Columbia River basin.   Our focus is on hydro developments which may frustrate BPA investmentsof ratepayer funds to achieve the goals of the Council's Fish and WildlifeProgram. The Northwest Federal power system expends over $100 million peryer on fish and wildlife, in actual expenditures and lost revenues. Thepolicy would ensure that those expenditures and that existing productivehabitat will not be harmed by future hydro development.   Initially, BPA would designate Protected Areas by using information collectedthrough the Council's Hydro Assessment Study. This information includes:  andbullet; Anadromous fish data collected by state and Federal fish and wildlifeagencies and tribes under Council direction.   andbullet; Resident fish and wildlife data collected by state and Federalfish and wildlife agencies, tribes, and interested parties such as hydrodevelopers as part of the BPA-funded Pacific Northwest Rivers Study.andbullet; The Pacific Northwest Hydropower Data Base and Analysis Systemwhich includes detailed information about 4,000 potential and existinghydro projects. This information was obtained using FERC data through ajoint effort by BPA, the Council, and the Corps. The Council's Hydro Assessment Study examined the effect of Protected Areadesignations on proposed hydro projects with license or permit applicationspending before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).According to Council staff, of a total 190 Columbia Basin hydro applicationspending before FERC, 118 (62 percent) fall within Protected Areas. If constructed,the total capacity of those Protected Area projects would be 847 MW, 35percent of the total Basin Hydro Capacity pending FERC license. The Council'sanalysis assumed that all projects in Protected Areas would be developed.Thus, the study tends to overestimate the power impacts because many ofthese potential projects might be frustrated by financing, engineering,environmental, or other barriers.IF the Council adopts its proposed Protected Area program, the proposedpolicy would provide BPA consistency with the Fish and Wildlife Program_subjectto BPA's review of Council changes. The 1988 draft policy largely eliminatesutility fears that they never know with certainty whether a hydro resourcewill qualify, or continue to qualify, for access to the Intertie. However,some uncertainty remains because BPA or the Council may change ProtectedArea designations as the program evolves through completion of the Council'ssub-basin and system planning efforts. Upon completion of the planningprocess, BPA will evaluate the fish and wildlife investments contemplatedin the plans and may consider revisions to its Protected Area designations.These revisions may add or delete areas from the designations.The 1988 proposed policy would not necessarily stop hydro development inProtected Areas. However, Protected Area designations would send an unambiguous,self-enforcing message to FERC, other regulator, and hydro developers thatno Intertie access will be provided for projects constructed in areas ofgreatest concern to BPA and the Council. Southwest market access couldnot be reflected in any accurate assessment of need for a project. Neithercould Southwest utility avoided costs be used in calculating the ``avoidedcost'' rate for a small hydro facility under the Public Utility RegulatoryPolicies Act (PURPA). A utility purchasing a Protected Area PURPA resourcemay have a very low avoided cost to the extent lost revenues associatedwith reduced Intertie access are reflected in its calculation.If a Scheduling Utility still proceeds to acquire a license or purchasepower from a hydro project within a Protected Area, BPA will reduce theamount of that utility's power transmitted over the Intertie under bothAssured Delivery and Formula Allocation provisions. These reductions willtake place regardless of whether project power is transmitted on the Intertie.There is no need to trace power flows from a Protected Area resource.Assured Delivery provisions affect long-term contracts, including SeasonalExchanges, for transmission of firm power. If a Scheduling Utility buildsor purchases power from a new hydro project located in a Protected Area,BPA will decrement that utility's Exhibit B by an amount equal to the nameplatecapacity of the project. If the utility has already utilized its ExhibitB amounts, Assured Delivery contracts of that utility will be decremented.Formula Allocations under Condition 1 depend on the amount of Northwesthydro resources owned or acquired by each utility. BPA will decrement theutility's ``Hydro Cap'' if a utility builds or purchases a hydro projectin a Protected Area.When FERC licenses expire on existing projects located within ProtectedArea, BPA will offer recommendations to assist the licensee in developingany necessary protective conditions to mitigate damage to BPA's fish andwildlife investments so that Intertie access may continue.For all hydro_new or existing_<T3>outside</T3> Protected Area, BPA will intervene in FERC proceedingsto protect its fish and wildlife investments.BPA believes that the revised fish and wildlife provisions are consistentwith its statutory authority. The United States Court of Appeals recentlycited Northwest Power Act section 4(h)(10) as authority for BPA to restrictIntertie access for hydro projects adverse to fish and wildlife resources.<T3>California Energy Commission </T3>v.<T3> BPA, </T3>Ninth Cir. Nos 84-7836, et al. (slip op. at 22, November6, 1987).<T3>Major Differences From The 1986 Draft Policy.</T3> The Interim andNear-Term IAPs addressed fish and wildlife concerns by prohibiting accessfor new power resources completed after September 7, 1984. The 1986 draftpolicy was more selective in its approach. Assured Delivery could be deniedprospectively if BPA determined that a resource was harmful. Utilitieswere required to declare which resources were used to support an AssuredDelivery contract. However, there were no enforcement provisions to ensurethat the resources listed were, in fact, those being used. BPA did notpropose to decrement the amount of power transmitted under an existingassured delivery contract. Formula Allocations would be decremented onlyby an amount equal to the power produced by a new resource_damage causedby existing resources would not result in decrements to Formula Allocations.The 1986 draft policy contained a presumption that existing hydro projectswere not harmful to BPA's investments in fish or wildlife. To rebut thatpresumption, complaints were accorded a process by which BPA would considerchallenges on a case-by-case basis. For a new project, challengers wereasked to show that it was harmful to fish and wildlife regardless of potentialeffect on BPA fish and wildlife investments. If BPA determined that anexisting project was harming its investments, BPA could enter into negotiationsto address the problem, and ultimately deny access.The utility community generally opposed the inclusion of such quasi-regulatoryprovisions, citing their belief that FERC should be the exclusive Federalregulator. Even if existing resources complied with applicable FERC licenseconditions, BPA could prohibit access if those resources detracted fromfish and wildlife measures under the Northwest Power Act. Utility commenterssuggested that if BPA continued to exercise regulatory oversight, it shouldadopt procedural protections akin to those in a Northwest Power Act section7(i) hearingFish and wildlife interests claimed the provisions should be much broaderand more detailed, providing a regional alternative and supplement to FERCregulation. In addition, they believe the sanctions did not adequatelyprohibit new and existing resources from damaging fish and wildlife sincedecrements applied to Formula Allocations did not prevent damage due toexisting operations.BPA considered removing all fish and wildlife provisions from the LTIAPand relying entirely on intervention in the FERC licensing proceedings.Under this approach, BPA would intervene in proceedings concerning bothnew and existing projects. Statutes governing FERC's review of the fishand wildlife effects have been revised since earlier IAPs were drafted.The Electric Consumers Protection Act (ECPA), enacted in 1986, increasedFERC's responsibility for reviewing fish and wildlife issues and providingmitigation. Section 3(a) of ECPA amends Federal Power Act provisions relevantto hydro licensing_including relicensing existing projects_as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">In deciding whether to issue any license under this Part for any project,the Commission, in addition to the power and development purposes for whichlicenses are issued, <T3>shall give equal consideration to</T3> the purposes of energy conservation,<T3>the protection, mitigation of damage to, and enhancement of, fish andwildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat</T3>), the protectionof recreational opportunities, and the preservation of other aspects ofenvironmental quality. [Emphasis supplied.] </ITAG>Section 8(a) of ECPA effectively terminates the exemption of PURPA small-hydroprojects from environmental regulation by FERC. Any small hydro projectutilizing a ``new dam'' \4\<NOTE/> must satisfy fairly rigorous conditions in order to claiman exemption from further regulation. PURPA section 210 does not applyto any new dam or diversion unless FERC finds that (1) the project willnot have substantial adverse effects on the environment, including recreationand water quality; (2) the project would not be located on a protectedriver; and (3) the project meets the terms and conditions set by fish andwildlife agencies.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ ``New dam or diversion'' means a dam requiring any construction,or enlargement of any impoundment or diversion structure (other than repairsor reconstruction or the addition of flashboards or similar devices). ECPA should increase FERC's attention to BP's fish and wildlife investmentsif BPA chooses to intervene in FERC proceedings. However, we believe thatexclusive reliance on FERC intervention may not provide sufficient protectionfor BPA fish and wildlife investments. FERC has no explicit statutory authorityto protect those investments and may ultimately license projects that couldnegatively affect those investments. The Protected Area concept providesan acceptable balance between the statutory perogatives of each Federalagency. It allows BPA to send a clear message to FERC and hydro developers,before the licensing process commences, about fish and wildlife mattersof greatest fiscal concern to BPA. The potential fish and wildlife effectsof new hydro projects will be considered at the time BPA designates itsProtected Areas. The provisions give developers more certainty as theyconsider the economics for potential projects, without lengthy case-by-caseBPA administrative process and without overlapping FERC's licensing activities.An ``existing project'' is defined as one licensed before the date thepolicy would take effect. The 1988 draft IAP considers fish and wildlifeeffects attributable to existing projects within Protected Areas only atthe time licenses for those projects expire. BPA may restrict Intertieaccess only when FERC initiates relicensing procedures and BPA and theproject operator cannot agree to structural and operational modificationsto mitigate potential damage to BPA fish and wildlife investments directlyattributable to that project. The 1988 draft IAP also does not providea means to prevent Intertie access to projects located outside ProtectedAreas.To address concerns that enforcement provisions in the Draft LTIAP wouldnot provide a significant deterrent, the revised LTIAP applies decrementsto existing assured delivery contracts. This provision seeks to preventutilities from developing potentially harmful resources in the future tosupport assured delivery contracts signed today. Consequently, assureddelivery contracts between utilities and their customers likely would needto provide for a reduction in the power delivered if BPA determines thatthe utility has built or purchased power from a project located in a PotectedArea.The Draft LTIAP sought to decrement Formula Allocations if a utility operateda project harmful to BPA's fish and wildlife investments. Since utilitiescould overdeclare their Formula Allocation needs in an effort to bluntany decrements BPA might apply to their Formula Allocations, BPA determinedthat decrements applied to Formula Allocations were not an effective enforcementmechanism. Consequently, the 1988 draft IAP does not apply decrements toFormula Allocations under Conditions 2 and 3.BPA has restructed the provisions affecting existing hydro projects becauseBPA believes the Council's Program and the FERC process adequately addressedBPA's investment concerns. Since adopting the Near Term IAP in 1985, BPAhas received only one challenge concerning the operation of an existingproject. That challenge, brought by the National Marine Fisheries Service(NMFS), concerned the Sullivan plant operated by Portland General Electricon the Willamette River. NMFS presented no data indicating how the SullivanPlant could harm BPA's investments in fish and wildlife facilities. Thereason BPA ultimately rejected the challenge, however, was that BPA determinedthat the project's power was not sold on the Intertie.<ITAG tagnum="75">Appendix A_Allocation to Market vs. Intertie under Condition 1: TheDifference in BPA's Available Capacity </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,i1,s25,r25 </C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1> Assumptions <ITAG tagnum="2">Intertie Capacity <D>4,000 MW </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">BPA price <D>15 m/kWh </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Market estimate <D>3,000 MW </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">Hydro Capacities: </ITAG><D> </D><ITAG tagnum="3">BPA </ITAG><D>20,000 MW </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Non-Federal utilities </ITAG><D>10,000 MW </D>Allocate to Intertie <ITAG tagnum="12">Allocation: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">BPA </ITAG><D>2,667 MW </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Non-Federal utilities </ITAG><D>1,333 MW </D><ITAG tagnum="12">Likely sales: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">BPA </ITAG><D>1,667 MW @ 16 m/kWh </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Non-Federal utilities </ITAG><D>1,333 MW @ 15.5 m/kWh </D> andbullet; Because BPA must announce its price first, the difference betweenthe market and Intertie all comes out of BPA allocation. andbullet; Note that because BPA's price is known, non-Federal utilitieshave no incentive to lower their price further than just below BPA's (unlessthe market at BPA's price is less than total non-Federal utilities' allocation).Allocate to Market <ITAG tagnum="12">Allocations: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">BPA </ITAG><D>2,000 MW </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Non-Federal utilities </ITAG><D>1,000 MW </D><ITAG tagnum="12">Likely Sales: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">BPA </ITAG><D>2,000 MW @ 16 m/kWh</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Non-Federal utilities </ITAG><D>1,000 MW @ 16 m/kWh </D> andbullet; Actual sales may differ from allocations.

Definitions. 1. ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of Bonneville Power Administration(BPA) and is used interchangeably with BPA. 2. ``Administrator's Power Marketing Program'' refers to all marketingactions taken and policies developed to fulfill BPA's statutory obligations.These actions and policies are based on exercises of broad authority toact, consistent with sound business principles, to recover revenue adequateto amortize Federal investments in the Federal Columbia River power andtransmission systems, while encouraging diversified use of electric powerat the lowest practical rates. In the Northwest, the Administrator's PowerMarketing Program includes BPA's power supply obligations and programsto market surplus power in a manner that assures an adequate, reliable,economical, efficient, and environmentally acceptable power supply, whilepreserving regional and public preference to Federal electric power. Inthe Southwest, the Administrator's Power Marketing Program includes theAdministrator's programs to market surplus Federal power at equitable pricesand to assist in marketing the Northwest's non-Federal power surplus. 3. ``Assured Delivery'' means firm Intertie transmission service providedby BPA under a transmission contract to wheel power covered by a contractbetween a Scheduling Utility and a Southwest utility. Assured Deliverycontracts may not exceed 20 years' duration. The service is interruptibleonly in the event of an uncontrollable force or a determination made pursuantto sections 7 or 8 of this policy. Assured Delivery service will be reducedonly by the amount of transmission capacity of the Southwest later acquiredby a Scheduling Utility through ownership or contract. 4. ``BPA Resources'' means Federal Columbia River Power System hydroelectricprojects; resources acquired by BPA under long-term contracts, includingresources acquired pursuant to sections 5(c) and 6 of the Northwest PowerAct; and resources acquired pursuant to section 11(b)(6)(i) of the FederalColumbia River Transmission System Act.5. ``Extraregional Utilities'' are generating utilities, or divisions thereof,that do not provide retail electric service and own or operate significantamounts of generating capacity in the Northwest.6. ``FD Supported Sale'' means that portion of a Scheduling Utility's firmsale equal, in amount and shape, to the utility's purchase of BPA FirmDisplacement power.7. ``Formula Allocation'' means the shares of Intertie Capacity made availableto Scheduling Utilities and, under certain conditions, Extraregional Utilitiesfor short-term sales of energy.8. ``Intertie'' means the two 500-kilovolt (kV) alternating current (AC)transmission lines and one 1,000-kV direct current (DC) line, which extendfrom Oregon into California or Nevada, and any additions thereto identifiedby BPA as Pacific Northwest-Pacific Southwest Intertie facilities.9. ``Intertie Capacity'' means the North to South transmission capacityof the Intertie controlled by BPA through ownership or contract; increasedby power scheduled South to North, decreased by loop flow, outages, andother factors that reduce transmission capacity; and further decreasedby Pacific Power andamp; Light Company's schedules, under its schedulingrights at the Main substation (BPA Contract Nos. DE-MS79-86BP92299 andDE-MS79-79BP90091).10. ``Mitigation'' refers to the conditions, other than rate schedule provisions,imposed by BPA on a Scheduling Utility in return for an Assured Deliverycontract. Mitigation helps offset operational and economic problems, attributableto a Scheduling Utility's power transaction, that inhibit BPA's abilityto meet its existing firm load obligations or to generate revenues. TheMitigation measures specified in this policy must be included in all AssuredDelivery contracts, unless substitute measures are negotiated with BPAon a case-by-case basis.11. ``Nonscheduling Utility'' means a non-Federal Northwest utility thatowns a generating resource, but does not operate a generation control areawithin the Pacific Northwest. A Nonscheduling Utility requesting Intertieaccess for its resource must do so through the Scheduling Utility (or BPA)in whose control area the resource is located.12. ``Pacific Northwest'' (or ``Northwest'') is defined in the NorthwestPower Act, 16 U.S.C. 839e, as the states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho;the portion of Montana west of the Continental Divide; portions of Nevada,Utah, and Wyoming within the Columbia River drainage basin; and any contiguousservice territories of rural electric cooperatives serving inside and outsidethe Pacific Northwest, not more than 75 air miles from the areas referredto above, that were served by BPA as of December 1, 1980.13. ``Protected Area'' means a stream reach within the Columbia River drainagebasin specially protected from hydroelectric development because of thepresence of anadromous or high value resident fish, or wildlife. Protectedareas may also include stream reaches which could support anadromous fishif investments were made in habitat, hatcheries, passage, or other projects.This policy contemplates that BPA will implement, after review and possiblemodification, a comprehensive protected area program adopted by the PacificNorthwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council.14. ``Qualified Extraregional Resources'' means:(a) A generating unit located outside the Northwest that was in commercialoperation on the effective date of this policy. However, the term excludesthe portions of units covered as Qualified Northwest Resources.(b) After the Administrator has determined that the capacity of the Intertieis rated at approximately 7,900 MW, all resources located outside of theNorthwest, other than the portions of extraregional resources covered asQualified Northwest Resources.15. ``Qualified Northwest Resources'' exclude BPA Resources, but include:(a) Generating resources located inside the Northwest that were in commercialoperation on the effective date of this policy. Regarding generating resourcesowned or controlled by Nonscheduling Utilities, it must be demonstratedthat a relationship had been established by that date with a SchedulingUtility or BPA to serve Northwest loads.(b) Scheduling Utility extraregional generating resources dedicated toNorthwest loads on the effective date of this policy. This term includespro rata portions of Montana Power Company's and Pacific Power and LightCompany's shares of the Colstrip No. 4 generating station, based on theratio of their respective regional loads to their respective total loads;and Idaho Power Company's share of Valmy No. 2.(c) New regional resources of Scheduling Utilities, except for hydroelectricresources located in Protected Areas, needed to support power contractsreceiving Assured Delivery service under this policy.16. ``Resource'' means an identified electric generating unit or stackof particular electric generating units identified to supply power or capacityfor sale over the Intertie.17. ``Scheduling Utility'' means the Northwest portion of a non-Federalutility that operates a generation control area within the Northwest.18. ``Seasonal Exchange'' means a transaction that takes advantage of seasonaldiversity between Northwest and Southwest loads through transfers of firmpower, at a prespecified delivery rate, from North to South during theSouthwest's summer load season and from South to North during the Northwest'swinter load season. Seasonal Exchanges may involve payments of additionalconsideration to reflect the relative seasonal values of power throughoutthe western United States. Seasonal Exchange schedules of Northwest utilitieswill be referred to as ``deliveries,'' and schedules of Southwest utilitieswill be referenced as ``returns.'' A Scheduling Utility must be able tosupport its summertime firm power deliveries with generating resourcesthat are surplus to its Northwest requirements. The sum of a SchedulingUtility's energy resources for each month in which deliveries are made(with special concern for August) must exceed its corresponding Northwestloads by an amount sufficient to support the Seasonal Exchange.19. ``Section 9(i)(3) resource'' means a Scheduling Utility resource thatBPA has granted priority in receiving BPA transmission, storage and loadfactoring services.Section 2. Intertie Capacity Reserved for BPA.The Administrator reserves for BPA's use Intertie Capacity sufficient to:(a) Deliver the full amount of BPA's surplus firm power, (b) Perform obligations under existing BPA transmission contracts listedin Exhibit C, to the extent such obligations differ from the conditionsspecified in this policy, and (c) Provide Assured Delivery service for transactions not subject to limitsunder Exhibit B to this policy.Section 3. Conditions For Intertie Access.(a) All Intertie access will be granted pursuant to the conditions andprocedures of this policy, unless otherwise specified in the three existingBPA transmission contracts listed in Exhibit C. (b) BPA will provide Intertie access only for BPA Resources and the QualifiedNorthwest Resources of Scheduling Utilities, except to the extent thatQualified Extraregional Resources are permitted access under this policy.(c) BPA will provide Assured Delivery and allocate remaining Intertie Capacitywhen providing such access will not substantially interfere with operatinglimitations of the Federal system. Examples of these limitations, whichreflect BPA's obligation to operate in an economical and reliable mannerconsistent with prudent utility practices, include:(1) The BPA reliability criteria and standards,(2) Western Systems Coordinating Council minimum operating reliabilitycriteria,(3) North American Electric Reliability Council Operating Committee minimumcriteria for operating reliability, and(4) Coordination agreements among BPA, scheduling utilities and other Federalagencies regarding resource and river operations.(d) Any utility that has contractual or ownership rights to transmissioncapacity to Southwest utilities must be fully utilizing such capacity priorto receiving any access to BPA Intertie Capacity.Section 4. Assured Delivery for Intertie AccessSubject to the limitations and other conditions in this section and inother sections of this policy, BPA has determined that it can provide AssuredDelivery to Scheduling Utilities without causing substantial interferencewith the Administrator's Power Marketing Program.(a) <T3>Access For Utilities Owning Or Controlling Southwest Interconnections.</T3>Assured Delivery is intended primarily for Scheduling Utilities which lackinterconnections with the Southwest. A utility with transmission accessto Southwest utilities, through contract or ownership, must utilize allsuch capacity on a firm basis before receiving any Assured Delivery. Autility is eligible for Assured Delivery only to the extent that the sumof its Exhibit B amounts exceeds its own transmission capacity to the Southwest.(b) <T3>Waiver Of BPA Service Obligation.</T3> Assured Delivery contracts mustcontain a waiver of BPA's obligation under the Scheduling Utility's powersales contract, up to the amount of power for which firm Intertie accessis provided.(c) <T3>Transactions Not Subject To Exhibit B Limits Under This Policy</T3>_(1)<T3>Joint Ventures.</T3> Joint ventures between BPA and utilities, suchas firm displacement contracts, which allow BPA to increase its sales ofsurplus power qualify for Assured Delivery.(2) <T3>Sales In Lieu Of Exchanges.</T3> BPA may offer to satisfy SchedulingUtility demands for Seasonal Exchanges by selling them incremental amountsof surplus firm power during winter months. Upon committing to purchasesuch incremental firm power at negotiated prices that reflect BPA's lostopportunities for summer sales, a Scheduling Utility will qualify for AssuredDelivery (with mitigation) to wheel an equal amount of firm capacity andenergy over the Intertie during summer months.(3) <T3>Conditions.</T3> A Scheduling Utility may request at any time the AssuredDelivery of transactions identified in sections 4(c)(1) and 4(c)(2). Relevantcontracts must be presented for review when Assured Delivery is requested.BPA will satisfy a request within 60 days after a Scheduling Utility hasdemonstrated satisfaction of the requirements of this policy.(d) <T3>Transactions Subject To Exhibit B Limits Under This Policy</T3>_(1)<T3>Maximum Amounts Of Assured Delivery.</T3> BPA will provide 800 MW ofAssured Delivery for transactions, limited by Exhibit B amounts, that areidentified in this policy. BPA will determine the amount of any additionalAssured Delivery increment after conclusion of the Third AC participationprocess. Moreover, the 800 MW amount may be subject to some reduction ifthe DC terminal expansion project is not completed on schedule.(2) <T3>Firm Power Sales</T3>_(A) <T3>Existing Transmission Contracts.</T3> BPA will provide Assured Deliveryfor the remaining term of the firm power sale contract identified in ExhibitC to this policy.(B) <T3>Exhibit B amounts</T3>_(i) <T3>Current maximum.</T3> Each Scheduling Utility's maximum Assured Deliveryamount for firm sales equals its average firm energy surplus, shown inExhibit B to this policy. Except for Montana Power Company (MPC), ExhibitB represents projected Scheduling Utility surpluses for the 1988-89 operatingyear. In satisfaction of all obligations to MPC under Northwest Power Actsection 9(i)(3), MPC's Exhibit B amount is set at 105 MW to facilitatelong-term sales of firm power from its share of the Colstrip No. 4 coal-firedgenerating station.(ii) <T3>Future changes.</T3> BPA may, at its discretion, revise Exhibit B toreflect changes in the firm power surpluses of individual utilities; however,the 361 MW Exhibit B average firm surplus total is not subject to increase.Any unutilized Assured Delivery amount is revoked if, upon revision, autility's individual Exhibit B amount has declined or if a utility hassold firm power to another utility seeking to increase its Exhibit B averagefirm surplus amount. A Scheduling Utility may increase its individual ExhibitB amount by purchasing surplus firm power from BPA or any Scheduling Utilitywith an Exhibit B amount.(iii)<T3> Nature Of Transactions.</T3> BPA will not provide Assured Deliveryfor transactions which a Scheduling Utility cannot demonstrate to be otherthan an advance arrangement to sell nonfirm energy. Nonfirm energy transactionsmay receive Intertie access only under section 5 of this policy.(C) <T3>Shaping.</T3> Firm power sales eligible for Assured Delivery may beshaped within the following ranges. During the months of September throughDecember, a Scheduling Utility may deliver firm energy at a rate up to1.8 times its Exhibit B average firm surplus amount. During the monthsof January through August, a Scheduling Utility may deliver firm energyat a rate no greater than 1.0 times its Exhibit B amount. However, totaldelivered energy may not exceed the Exhibit B annual firm energy maximum.(3) <T3>Seasonal Exchanges</T3>_(A) <T3>Existing Contracts.</T3> BPA will provide Assured Delivery for theremaining term of the Seasonal Exchange contracts identified in ExhibitC to this policy.(B) <T3>Exhibit B Amounts.</T3> Subject to the individual utility SeasonalExchange maximums in Exhibit B, BPA will provide Assured Delivery to facilitateSeasonal Exchanges of Qualified Northwest Resources. The current ExhibitB (representing Intertie Capacity Available for Assured Delivery) is subjectto revision at the discretion of BPA.(4) <T3>Mitigation</T3>_(A) <T3>Firm Sales And Seasonal Exchange Deliveries. </T3>During any hour inwhich BPA has invoked Condition 1 allocation procedures to prescheduleenergy deliveries, each utility's Assured Delivery amount shall be deductedfrom its formula allocation to determine its share of energy scheduledon the Intertie. If the remainder is negative for a given utility, thenthat utility must pruchase sufficient energy from BPA, at BPA's then-applicablerate, to make up the difference.(B) <T3>Seasonal Exchange Returns</T3>_(i) <T3>Returns.</T3> Exchange contracts must specify that all return energybe scheduled to either the AC Intertie point of interconnection at theCalifornia-Oregon border (``COB'') or the DC Intertie point of interconnectionat the Nevada-Oregon border (``NOB''). Exchange contracts must also specifyprescheduled determinations of hourly energy returns.(ii) <T3>Cash out.</T3> During any hour in which BPA has invoked Condition 1or Condition 2 allocation procedures to preschedule energy deliveries,a utility may not utilize the cash-out provisions of a Seasonal Exchangecontract. The rate of a cash out during Condition 3 shall not exceed therate at which the exchange return could have been scheduled.(5) <T3>Satisfying Requests For Assured Delivery.</T3> To allow sufficienttime for contract negotiation, initial requests under this policy willbe accepted until February 1, 1989. Thereafter, BPA will negotiate andexecute Assured Delivery contracts. If Intertie Capacity remains availablefor Assured Delivery of transactions limited by Exhibit B amounts, subsequentrequests must be received no later than 120 days before commencement ofthe next BPA operating year. All relevant power contracts must be presentedfor review no later than the date on which a request for Assured Deliveryis made. BPA will not entertain Assured Delivery requests for firm powersales in excess of a utility's Exhibit B maximum.Section 5. Formula Allocation Methods.(a) <T3>Limits On Intertie Capacity Available For Formula Allocation.</T3>Generally, BPA will determine Intertie Capacity available for Formula Allocationsafter first taking into account the amount of Intertie Capacity necessaryto satisfy requirements of the Administrator's Power Marketing Program,existing transmission contracts listed in Exhibit C, and Assured Deliverycontracts executed by BPA pursuant to this policy. However, during Condition1, BPA will not consider the Assured Delivery contracts subject to mitigationrequirements in determining available Intertie capacity. BPA may reduceany allocation, if additional Intertie Capacity is required to minimizerevenue losses associated with actions taken to protect fish in the ColumbiaRiver drainage basin.(b) <T3>Northwest Scheduling Utility Requirements.</T3> BPA will make utilitiesaware of scheduling requirements before the policy is implemented.(c) <T3>Allocation Methods.</T3>_(1) <T3>Condition 1</T3>_(A) <T3>Until December 31, 1988.</T3> Intertie Capacity will be allocated pursuantto the Exportable Agreement (BPA Contract No. 14-03-73155), when applicable.(B) <T3>After December 31, 1988.</T3> Condition 1 will be in effect when theFederal system is in spill or in likelihood of spill, as determined byBPA. Available Intertie capacity will be allocated pursuant to the followingprocedure:(i) Each hour, the maximum Condition 1 allocations for BPA and each SchedulingUtility will be based on the ratio of their respective hydroelectric generatingcapacities to the Northwest's total hydroelectric generating capacity,multiplied by the available Intertie capacity (the ``Hydro Cap''). To theextent that the declarations of some Scheduling Utilities are less thantheir respective Hydro Caps, BPA will allocate the remainder, pro rata,to itself and to other Scheduling Utilities whose declarations are greaterthan, or equal to, their respective Hydro Caps. Examples of allocationsunder Condition 1 are shown in Exhibit A.(ii) During Condition 1, whenever the Southwest market at BPA's applicablerate is less than the available Intertie capacity, BPA will allocate nomore capacity than that market amount.(iii) In calculating each Scheduling Utility's Hydro Cap, BPA will reducethe hydroelectric generating capacities of individual utilities by anyProtected Area decrements determined pursuant to section 7.(2) <T3> Condition 2.</T3> When Condition 1 is not in effect, but BPA and SchedulingUtilities declare amounts of energy that exceed available Intertie capacity,Formula Allocations for BPA and each Scheduling Utility will approximate,by hour, the ratio of each declaration to the sum of all declarations,multiplied by the available Intertie capacity. An example of an allocationunder Condition 2 is shown in Exhibit A. (3)<T3> Condition 3.</T3> When Condition 1 is not in effect and when the totalsurplus energy declared available by BPA and Scheduling Utilities is lessthan the total available Intertie Capacity, BPA and Scheduling Utilities'allocations will equal their declarations. The remaining Intertie capacitywill be made available to Extraregional Utilities. Examples of the twopossible allocation procedures under Condition 3 are shown in AppendixA. (d)<T3> Modified Allocations Upon Commercial Operation of the Third A.C. Interconnection.</T3>When the market power of California Intertie owners is reduced upon commercialoperation of the third AC interconnection, BPA will cease allocating individualIntertie capacity amounts to non-Federal utilities during Conditions 2and 3. Instead, after allocating sufficient capacity to itself, BPA willto the extent practicable make the remaining Intertie Capacity availableas a block to Scheduling Utilities, and make any residual amount underCondition 3 available to Extraregional Utilities. However, this provisionwill not be operative if the Administrator determines that: (1) Even after commercial operation of the third AC, Intertie access continuesto be impaired for California utilities presently lacking ownership inthe southern portion of the Intertie, or (2) Southwest utilities utilize some pro rata scheme to allocate energypurchases over the Intertie. <T3>Section 6. Access for Qualified Extraregional Resources. </T3>(a)<T3> Assured Delivery.</T3> Any request for Assured Delivery of power froma Qualified Extraregional Resource would be granted only by contract which,in addition to the Mitigation measures specified in section 4(d)(4)(B),must include benefits to BPA such as increased storage, improved systemcoordination or operation, or other consideration of value commensuratewith the services provided. However, Canadian Extraregional Utilities willnot be provided Assured Delivery service until the Administrator has determinedthat the capability of the Intertie is rated at approximately 7,900 MW.Proposed contracts would be evaluated by BPA and reviewed publicly to determinewhether it would cause substantial interference with the Administrator'sPower Marketing Program. An environmental review would also be conducted.(b)<T3> Formula Allocation.</T3> Under Condition 3, energy from Canadian QualifiedExtraregional Resources will have access to the Intertie to the extentthat Intertie Capacity is available in excess of the amount used by BPA,Scheduling Utilities, and energy from U.S. Qualified Extraregional Resources.BPA may provide Qualified Extraregional Resources with some additionalFormula Allocation, if the utility owner agrees by contract either to increasedparticipation in the Pacific Northwest's coordinated planning and operation,or to provide other consideration of value, apart from the standard BPAwheeling rate, commensurate with the services provided. <T3>Section 7. Fish and Wildlife Protection. </T3>(a)<T3> Purpose.</T3> Hydroelectric projects constructed in Protected Areasmay substantially decrease the effectiveness of, or substantially increasethe need for, expenditures and other actions by BPA, under Northwest PowerAct section 4(h), to protect, mitigate or enhance fish and wildlife resources.Intertie access will not be provided to facilitate the transmission ofpower generated by any new hydroelectric projects located in ProtectedAreas, licensed after the effective date of this policy. Upon expirationof a Federal Power Act license for an existing project located within aProtected Area, BPA will assist the licensee in developing any necessaryprotective conditions so that the project may continue to qualify for Intertieaccess. (b)<T3> Implementation.</T3> This policy contemplates that BPA will implement,after review and possible modification, a comprehensive protected areaprogram adopted by the Pacific Northwest Electric Power and ConservationPlanning Council. In the meantime, BPA will adopt the Protected Area designationscompiled by the Council staff. Exhibit D lists those stream reaches, usingEnvironmental Protection Agency stream reach codes, currently designatedby BPA as protected areas. (c)<T3> Enforcement.</T3> If a Scheduling Utility or Nonscheduling Utilityowns, or acquires the output from, a hydroelectric project covered underthe restrictions of section 7(a), BPA will reduce that utility's AssuredDelivery capacity and the Formula Allocation made available to it underthe Condition 1 Hydro Cap by either the nameplate rating of the project(in the case of ownership), or the amount of capacity acquired. <T3>Section 8. Other Enforcement Provisions. </T3>Whenever the terms of this policy are not being met, BPA will inform theappropriate utility of the nature of the noncompliance and actions thatmay be taken to achieve compliance. If noncompliance is not corrected withina reasonable period, BPA may impose an appropriate sanction. Sanctionsinclude denial of access for a resource and refusal to accept schedules.<ITAG tagnum="85">Exhibit A_Formula Allocation Example of Formula Allocation Under Condition1 </ITAG><T3>Assumptions Used in This Example </T3>1.
