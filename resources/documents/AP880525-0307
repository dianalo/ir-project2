Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji, Tahiti, Papua New Guinea, Tonga,Western Samoa, even New Zealand and Australia themselves, have hada taste of trouble in the past year.   Most recently it was rioting in Vanuatu over land claims, and inthe French territory of New Caledonia 19 native Kanaks were killedin a shootout with French troops in ethnic and political disorders.   Fiji has seen two coups in the past year, and the former Britishisland remains unstable in the aftermath.   Australia is concerned about what it sees as the speadinginfluence of Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi in the area and theinroads made by the Soviet Union in what long has been seen as an``American lake.''   A commentator in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper said theimage of a South Seas paradise may have been permanently tarnished.   The past year also has seen riots in Tahiti and politicalupheaval in Papua New Guinea over the alleged corruption of Cabinetministers.   New Zealand faces racial unrest as indigenous Maoris press theLabor Party government of Prime Minister David Lange with a batteryof land and fisheries claims.   In Australia, aborigines are using this year's bicentennialcelebrations to highlight grievances they say grew out of Europeansettlement 200 years ago.   In early May, bloody violence erupted over territorial andFrench presidential elections in New Caledonia, culminating in therescue of French hostages held in caves by Melanesian separatists;21 people were killed.   On May 16, a drunken mob ran riot through Vanuatu's capital,Port Vila, looting shops and smashing office windows. One man died,nine others were injured and police arrested 30 people in therioting over land claims.   Australia and New Zealand responded to the crisis by airliftingriot-control gear to Vanuatu at Prime Minister Walter Lini'srequest.   Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia linked Libya to therioting and said Australia could not stand by as a friendlycountry's government is undermined by what he called anon-democratic process.   ``There is no doubt about a Libyan connection in Vanuatu,''Hawke said. ``In a city with a population of less than 20,000 it isclear that these disturbances have been on a very serious scale.''   Vanuatu, formerly the British-French New Hebrides, shocked thegenerally pro-Western South Pacific with its decision in 1986 toestablish diplomatic relations with Libya and the Soviet Union.   Since then, the Soviet Union has sought fishing agreements withPapua New Guinea and impoverished Kiribati, creating concern inAustralia as well as Washington about Soviet inroads in the region.   More recently, the Soviet Union has approached Australia forfishing access to Australian ports for refueling purposes and toAustralian airports for fishing crews in transit. Hawke said hewould treat the request with caution.   Elsewhere in the South Pacific, such nations as Tonga andWestern Samoa face poverty, overcrowding and unemployment. Many ofthe islanders have migrated to Australia and New Zealand in searchof jobs.   ``All these are turning the once tranquil South Pacific into anincreasingly complex set of real and potential troublespots,'' theSydney Morning Herald said.   The Sydney Daily Telegraph echoed that concern, calling thesituation a powderkeg.   ``The multiple problems of these islands has led to a risingdiscontent,'' the Telegraph said. ``Moscow has been making bigefforts to gain a stronger foothold in every island group throughfishery deals and aid.''   Racial and ethnic divisions remain a major underlying problem ofmany Pacific islands, where populations are mainly Melanesian. Fijiand New Caledonia are examples.   Australia is the major power in the region and its largest aiddonor.   Foreign Minister Bill Hayden has expressed concern about Libyanactivities, going as far as to close down Libya's diplomaticmission in Canberra last year after an incident involving theaboriginal activist Michael Mansell.   Mansell had returned from Libya saying Gadhafi was prepared tobankroll a black revolution in Australia.   The scattered violence in the South Seas has no singleconnective thread, although in New Caledonia and French Polynesiathe crises erupted after France refused to follow the regionalpattern of decolonization and independence.   France already suffers a major image problem in the South Seaswith the bombing of the Greenpeace vessel Rainbow Warrior in NewZealand in 1985 and its continued underground nuclear testing onthe Mururoa atoll over the objections of almost every island statein the region.   The island states, supported by Australia and New Zealand, havedeclared the South Pacific a nuclear-free zone.   In a major turnaround, the United States in 1986 designated theSouth Pacific an area of concern because of a buildup of the SovietPacific fleet.   U.S. officials believe the Soviet fleet consists of 755 shipsand patrol craft, including 141 submarines.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tues AMs, May 31</NOTE></DOC>
