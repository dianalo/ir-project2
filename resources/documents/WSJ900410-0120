Network, a communications network designer that untilrecently had been considered among the hottest companies inthe industry, said it expects to report earnings per share of10 cents for the quarter ended March 31, only about a thirdof the 33 cents a share posted for the year-earlier period,and far below analysts' estimates. The company also saidrevenue would be $44 million compared with $38.8 million ayear ago, a substantially smaller increase than analysts hadbeen expecting.</LP><TEXT>   The disclosures pounded Network's stock, which plunged$5.75 to close at $15.125 in New York Stock Exchangecomposite trading. The stock had been moving steadily higherover the past year, rising from $18 a share in 1988 to arecent high of $34.375 shortly before its reverses.   The news was the second embarrassment in a matter of daysfor Network and its high-profile chief executive officer,Bruce D. Smith. On April 2, Network's stock plunged 21%following the company's surprise prediction that quarterlyearnings would be lower than a year earlier.   At the time, Network blamed a greater-than-expecteddecline in sales through International Business MachinesCorp. and a failure to receive confirmation of certainorders.   Many analysts had dismissed the 21% stock tumble as anoverreaction, but nevertheless most cut their profitestimates for the quarter to about 31 cents from 39 cents andtrimmed revenue projections to about $50 million from $56million.   But Network said a thorough review over the weekend turnedup &quot;terms of sale&quot; that didn't &quot;conform to (company)policies.&quot; Furthermore, Network said it is investigatingshipments made against an order that it described as &quot;notvalid.&quot; It said the improprieties reduced both margins andrevenue, worsening the already depressed quarterly results.   The company couldn't be reached to elaborate on the salesirregularities or whether any fraud may have been involved.However, securities analysts said Mr. Smith informed them ina conference call yesterday that the problems were&quot;localized&quot; and minimal and have been cleared up, in part byshifting some personnel. One analyst, George P. Kelly ofMorgan Stanley andamp; Co., said he still believes that Network'smanagement is &quot;the best in the business&quot; and that thecompany's prospects are still strong.   The personnel shifts Mr. Smith mentioned to analysts mayhave included Roger T. Hobbs, vice president of nationalmarketing, whom Network announced has resigned. The companydidn't say whether the resignation was related to the salesproblems and Mr. Hobbs couldn't be reached for comment. Hewas succeeded by Craig Tysdal, formerly vice president ofproduct marketing.   The troubles come at an awkward time for Network and Mr.Smith. Mr. Smith has embarked on an ambitious, costly plan todevelop a global network computer system that will have thecapability to manipulate data much more extensively thancurrent systems. Meanwhile, the company's core business ofproducing standard networks is slowing, mainly because of thereduced sales through IBM. Network has estimated thatdeveloping the new network software will eat up about halfits research and development budget in coming years.   Moreover, Network is likely to face competition from someof the biggest companies in computing, including HewlettPackard Co. and Digital Equipment Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
