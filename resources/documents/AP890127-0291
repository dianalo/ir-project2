The $3 billion of bonds being used to help finance the leveragedbuyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. by LBO specialists Kohlberg KravisRoberts andamp; Co. is oversubscribed, an industry source said. Drexel, apioneer in junk bond financing and still the leader in the business,is handling the offer.   Plenty of the sophisticated, institutional investors who havebeen asked by Drexel if they want to buy the bonds apparently haveexpressed an interest in them, the source said.   Placing the bonds with customers is one of the last things thatmust be done before the record $25 billion buyout can be completed.After this, the only thing needed is approval from governmentantitrust investigators.   Neither Drexel nor KKR would confirm that the offer is sold out.   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said, ``We are very pleased withthe response. I think it reflects the fact that it was structured toappeal to buyers around the world.''   A Kohlberg Kravis Roberts spokeswoman said, ``The issue has beenwell received.''   Although customers haven't made any binding purchase commitmentsand could still turn Drexel down, analysts expect the sales to gooff without a hitch.   Anreder said the bonds will be priced next week, after which theycan be formally distributed to the institutional investors, such aspension funds and insurance companies, who agree to buy them.   The successful conclusion of the offering would be a significantmilestone for the junk bond market and provide fresh evidence thatit has staying power even though Drexel, the engine of itsdevelopment, has been entangled in the nation's biggest securitiesfraud scandal.   This past week details came out of the bargain Drexel made withthe government to settle criminal charges against the firm.   Besides promising to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay anunprecedented $650 million in fines and restitution, Drexel agreedto fire its junk bond wizard Michael R. Milken and not to pay himhis 1988 bonus, which could be as high as $200 million.   As head of Drexel's high-yield bond department, based in BeverlyHills, Calif., Milken was considered king of the business and theone who carried Drexel to the top of the junk bond hill.   When the depth of Drexel's and Milken's difficulties became knownlast year, there was speculation that the entire $180 billion marketin junk bonds would suffer and Drexel would be toppled permanentlyfrom its lofty perch.   Instead, the market appears to be doing fine and Drexel ismaintaining its dominance of the business.   Proponents of high-yield, high-risk securities say the marketdeserves more respect than it gets and many such analysts wereunsurprised that the huge RJR bond offering appears easilydigestible by investors hungry for the appealing returns that thebonds will provide.   ``It doesn't surprise me at all. The market has grown so much inthe last few years and it's really performing a social and economicfunction,'' said Robert Waill, a managing director of L.F.Rothschild Holdings Inc.   ``The whole thing has gotten broader and broader and it hashappened for fairly sensible reasons,'' he said, noting that manyinstitutional investors with huge, well diversified portfolios havecome to rely on so-called junk bonds to complement their moreconservative, lower-yielding holdings.   Smaller investors searching for big returns who shouldn't takethe risk of buying the bonds individually, can put money in mutualfunds devoted to the bonds, he said.   Says Waill, ``The market has been converted from a crap shoot toa dull statistical business.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Jan. 28-29</NOTE></DOC>
