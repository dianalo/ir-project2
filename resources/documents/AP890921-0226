Hatakeyama, director general of the International Trade PolicyBureau, said the ministry is considering a plan to grant special taxincentives for importers.   During Japan's industrial buildup after its defeat in World WarII, incentives granted to exporters allowed them to reduce theirtaxes by from 1 percent to 3 percent of the value of their exports.The system was discontinued in 1964.   Hatakeyama said the government is considering a similar system topromote imports. The tax breaks would not extend to importers of rawmaterials, he said.   Japan is under pressure from the United States to increase itsimports and institute other economic and trade policy changes to cutits surplus.   Earlier this month, the two countries began a yearlong round ofbimonthly talks on structural impediments to trade in each nation,and U.S. officials have said they expect ``measurable'' improvementin the trade imbalance by next spring.   Japan also has been named, along with India and Brazil, as apossible target of retaliation under U.S. trade laws for policiesthat allegedly hinder the sale here of supercomputers, lumberproducts and satellites.   U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, in a three-day visitto Japan last week, welcomed the idea of tax incentives to Japaneseimporters as a far-reaching method of increasing imports and cuttingthe trade imbalance.   Total Japanese imports have risen 16.5 percent in the first eightmonths of this year, and imports from the United States haveincreased by 19.9 percent from the same period last year, the tradeministry says.   The senior trade official said the proposed tax breaks are notlikely to be implemented until next spring at the earliest, sinceParliament would have to approve legislation.   But Hatakeyama admitted the tax breaks could take even longerbecause of political uncertainties.   Plagued by a series of scandals and an unpopular new sales tax,the governing Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority in theupper house of Parliament in July for the first time in 34 years.   A general election for the more powerful lower house must be heldby next summer.   It is not clear whether the proposed tax incentives would belegal under rules of the international trade body known as theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.   ``But we hope no countries would complain about this scheme,''Hatakeyama said.</TEXT></DOC>
