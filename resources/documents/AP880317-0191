Manuel Espinoza Enriquez said the attack on Bocay caused noinjuries or damage. Sandinista troops fired on the planes, forcingthem to turn back to Honduras, he said.   He said the planes fired at least five rockets at theheadquarters but did not say if any struck their target.   The attack came a day after Honduras charged that Nicaraguantroops had entered its territory while pursuing U.S.-backed Contrarebels.   President Daniel Ortega said Thursday that Nicaragua was readyto ``combat and liquidate'' American troops sent to Honduras afterthe reported incursion. He said his soldiers won't withdraw fromthe border region.   Ortega also called for a meeting of the U.N. Security Council todeal with what he called ``one more escalation of the war againstNicaragua.''   ``We logically are going to maintain our offensive ... we arenot going to withdraw our troops now that we have recovered ourterritory,'' he said.   ``We are ready to combat and liquidate the famous forces of the82nd Airborne Division,'' he said.   Earlier, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Nicaragua already hadbegun withdrawing troops from the border region after driving about2,000 Contra rebels back into Honduras.   ``The operations have succesfully been concluded, and we don'tplan to stay along the border region. In fact, this deescalationhas already begun,'' the spokesman, Alejandro Bendana, said onNBC's ``Today'' show.   Ortega spoke to reporters before meeting with 14 oppositionparties ``to explain to them the national and internationalsituation.''   The 3,200 U.S. troops that began arriving in Honduras onThursday include two battalions from the 82nd Airborne at FortBragg, N.C.   Ortega called the U.S. troop movement ``a dangerous act'' andaccused the United States of pressuring Honduras into asking forthe American presence.   The C-141 planes carrying the U.S. troops were arriving every 30minutes at Palmerola air force base, the main center of U.S.military operations in Honduras. The base is about 125 miles westof the border, where heavy fighting was reported Wednesday.   Bendana denied U.S. and Honduran allegations that Sandinistatroops entered Honduras, and he invited the United Nations andOrganization of American States to visit the area to ``establishwhat the facts are and end these accusations.''   Ortega himself wouldn't say if Sandinista troops crossed theborder.   ``Here the question is not if (Nicaraguan) army troopspenetrated Honduran tserritory or not, but that we have dozens ofcamps of mercenary forces in Honduran territory, in view of andtolerated by the Honduran government,'' he said.   But Honduran military officials, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said about 4,000 Honduran soldiers were surroundingabout 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers Thursday. The sources said theentire Honduran military was on alert.   Ortega told reporters the Nicaraguan ``invasion only exists inthe warped imagination of the North American leaders'' and said thesending of American troops ``violates international law and theregional peace efforts,'' he added.   ``We demand that the United States withdraw its troops fromHonduras immediately and, with this, contribute to the meeting thatis going to be held in Sapoa March 21 having positive results,'' hesaid.   Government and Contra representatives are scheduled to beginthree days of peace talks Monday in Sapoa, a town in southernNicaragua near the border with Costa Rica.   Ortega said the United States would use the current situation togive the Contras logistical and military aid not approved byCongress.   At the United Nations, the Nicaraguan Mission confirmed that thegovernment plans to ask for a meeting of the 15-member SecurityCouncil, the highest U.N. body.   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuella called forrestraint in the conflicts but had not decided whether to send inan observer team.</TEXT></DOC>
