The master plan for the $200 million terminal, it was recentlyrevealed, contains a fundamental flaw: one of the terminal's wingswill block the control tower's line of sight to part of a runway.   Airport codes require that the tower must have an unobstructedview of all runways.   James A. Wilding, general manager of the Metropolitan WashingtonAirports Authority, said his office has been aware of the problemfor several years and believed it could be handled with minimaladjustments.   He said the ``ruckus'' only began in recent months when peopleseized on the design defect to urge major alterations in the masterplan that would add up to $100 million to the cost of the project.   Wilding acknowledges, however, that some members of theauthority's board of directors were unaware until recently of theobscured runway issue. ``Obviously there was a communicationproblem.''   After several weeks of discussions, the authority is leaningtoward relocating the control tower, a solution that will boost theprice tag for the $735 million renovation project by only $15million or $20 million and not seriously affect the scheduled 1994completion date.   Authority spokesman David Hess said focus turned to the blindspot this spring when the design team, led by well-known architectCesar Pelli, started working out details for the 35-gate terminal.   Wilding thought the dilemma was solvable by repositioning orlowering the height of the most northerly finger of the terminal.But some members of the board reportedly were concerned the lowceilings would be aesthetically unacceptable, and the airlinesbalked at changes in carefully worked-out gate assignments.   ``The carriers were not in favor of that option because itdoesn't provide equal accessibility to all,'' said Dick DeiTos,executive director of the Metropolitan Washington AirlinesCommittee. DeiTos said his organization, which represents theairlines at National Airport, learned of the line-of-sight problemabout a year ago.   That was far earlier than for some members of the authority'sboard.   ``I do not recall it being raised,'' said Carrington Williams,one of 11 board members and chairman of the authority's planningcommittee. ``I was surprised at the magnitude of the problem whenit was brought to our attention three or four months ago.''   One outgrowth of that revelation was a proposal that the entireterminal be relocated farther to the west, away from the runways.   An advantage would be that the existing Metro railway stationcould then be included in the terminal building, rather thanconnected by an enclosed pedestrian walkway as planned.   On the debit side, such a move would mean a two-to-three-yeardelay in completion and an extra $100 million in cost. ``Theairlines would bear the brunt of it,'' DeiTos said, with much ofthe expense eventually passed on to consumers.   The board in late August killed the new terminal idea.   National, one of the capitol's two main airports along withDulles, has been operating out of the same terminal for 49 years.With nearly 16 million passengers a year and an average 37 flightslanding or taking off every hour during the day, no one questionsthe need for major renovation.   There was also general sympathy for the authority's difficultyin trying to squeeze a new and larger terminal into only 90 acresof usable land between a highway and the Potomac River.   ``In an airport as restricted as National, you've got to expectsome glitches, and there probably will be more,'' said the board'sWilliams.   ``There's not much room to wiggle,'' DeiTos said.   Wilding said redesign of the northern finger and relocation of ataxiway on the affected runway are still being considered. But thefinal decision, expected in two or three months, appears movingsolidly toward either relocating the control tower or raising theheight of the existing tower on the old terminal.   Even that would have to gain the approval of the FederalAviation Administration and the National Capital PlanningCommission, which oversees any alteration of Washington'sskyscraper-less skyline.</TEXT></DOC>
