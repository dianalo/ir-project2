Hormones were determined in the peripheralblood of the donor rats by radioimmunoassay. Inhibin activity in themale rats is shown. DHT caused a very small increase in inhibin activityin the testis. Further study of relations between androgens and inhibinat peripheral and central levels will facilitate fertility control.</TEXT></DOC>
