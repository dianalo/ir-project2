Albert-Alain Peters, an Addis Ababa representative of the U.N.High Commissioner for Refugees, said Wednesday that about 650refugees were entering Ethiopia daily, up from 150 at the beginningof August.   The refugees had reported heavy fighting between the rebel SomaliNational Movement and government troops around the garrison town ofBorama near the Ethiopian border, Peters said.   Borama is about 60 miles northwest of Hargeisa, Somalia'ssecond-largest town.   The refugees, mostly women and children, are camped in a remotearea six miles from the border and about 250 miles northeast ofEthiopia's capital, Addis Ababa.   Peters, who returned from a visit to the area Wednesday, said theU.N. agency would start caring for the refugees as soon as Ethiopianauthorities moved them to more easily accessible areas fartherinside the country.   They are the latest in a wave of refugees who started comingacross the border in May 1988 when fighting intensified between therebels and government troops around the northern towns of Hargeisa,Burao and Berbera. An estimated 350,000 Somalis have sought refugein U.N.-managed camps near Jijiga, about 60 miles southwest of thenew arrivals.   The Somali National Movement has been fighting to topple thegovernment of President Mohamed Siad Barre since 1981.   Exiled dissidents recently have claimed Barre's government haslost control of all but the capital and is experiencing the mostwidespread fighting across the East African nation since Barreseized power in 1969.   The dissidents say that in addition to the northern fighting,soldiers who belong to the Ogadeni clan have turned against thegovernment in the south.   A Kenyan newspaper reported that more than 5,500 Somalis had fledto Kenya following government raids on their southern Somali bordertown last month.   It is impossible to confirm rebel claims independently. Thegovernment has refused to let journalists into Somalia since May1988 and Mogadishu residents contacted by telephone say they knowlittle about events outside the capital.</TEXT></DOC>
