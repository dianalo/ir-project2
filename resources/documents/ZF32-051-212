Fuller, senior product manager at Chipcom.andP;  &quot;The ONlineconcentrators support all major media types, including twisted-pair, fiber,thick coaxial and, now, thin coaxial.andP;  While some customers will migrate to10BASE-T twisted-pair Ethernets, there is still a very large installed baseof thin Ethernet LANs.andP;  Since some of these customers do not want to changethe wiring structure they already have in place, our new BNC Module lets themintegrate their thin-wire LANs into the ONline concentrator which providesthe flexibility to migrate to other media types.&quot;andM;PRICING andamp; AVAILABILITY The ONline Ethernet BNC Module (model number5106M-BNC) has a North American list price of $1,995, and is scheduled to beavailable in 45 days.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
