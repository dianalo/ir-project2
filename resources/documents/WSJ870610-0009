Shares in Tokyo and Frankfurt fell in light trading.    In London, the 100-share index surged 36.8 points to 2265.2, surpassing the record set last Wednesday. The financial times 30-share index was up 34.1 to a record 1761.3.    The market's rise shows &quot;no more and no less that (participants in) the City have made up their minds the Tories are going to win and will have a working majority&quot; in the new parliament, a dealer said.    Confidence in a Tory victory grew following release of a poll showing the ruling Conservatives 13 percentage points ahead of the Labor Party, up from margins of about 10 points in other recent polls.    Dealers reported renewed buying interest based on the poll result. The session's gains also reflected markups by market-makers anxious not to go short of stock ahead of the election, they added.    &quot;The market-makers are trying desperately hard to keep even books&quot; ahead of the election, a dealer said. &quot;If the Conservatives win, on Friday the market will be 100 points better,&quot; he predicted.    Building-related shares rose on hopes that interest rates may come down if the Conservatives win a third term, dealers said. Blue Circle Industries rose 33 pence to 510 pence ($8.35), RMC Group was up 23 pence at 998 pence, Tarmac was up six pence at 581 pence and BPB Industries rose 27 pence to 845 pence.    Stores also were boosted by hopes of lower interest rates. Boots was up nine pence at 297 pence, Dixons gained two pence to 393 pence, Burton advanced 19 pence to 344 pence, Great Universal rose 37 pence to #14.20 and Marks andamp; Spencer was up 11 pence to 265 pence.    Banks gained after news that BankAmerica would increase its loan-loss reserves $1.1 billion after similar moves by other major U.S. banks. Barclays gained six pence to 543 pence, Lloyds Bank was up eight pence at 540 pence, National West minster Bank rose 14 pence at 682 pence and Midland Bank advanced one pence to 605 pence.    In Tokyo, share prices slid on light volume as investor interest faded with the start of the seven-nation economic summit in Venice.    The Nikkei stock average fell 144.01 points to 25379.88. Turnover came to about 620 million shares, down from 650 million shares Monday. Decliners outnumbered gainers 566 to 362.    Traders said weakness in the dollar and disappointment that a partial lifting of U.S. sanctions against Japanese electronics products didn't go further caused investor sentiment to deteriorate. Many investors were still taking a wait-and-see attitude during this week's Venice summit. A sense is growing, however, that the meeting won't result in major trade and currency policy announcements, traders said.    Opinion also leans to the idea the yen will appreciate further against the dollar in the near-term. Statements by the Bank of Japan that it currently isn't considering a reduction in the official discount rate confused investors reacting to rumors the U.S. is pressing Japan for a cut.    Auto makers were little changed to slightly higher. Certain retailers and banks were higher on modest bargain-hunting and speculation about improved business performance. Otherwise, traders said, most sectors were lower.    Among auto makers, Honda Motor rose 10 yen to 1,540 yen ($10.73) on word that it will expand its production of four-wheel steering systems in the domestic market. Suzuki Motor shot up 40 yen to 660 yen on speculation that its competitive stance in the U.S. is improving despite the erosive effects of the high yen. Toyota Motor surged 40 yen to 1,900 yen on a ripple effect, traders said.    Among retailers, Mitsukoshi was up 20 yen to 1,720 yen and Daiei gained 20 yen to 1760 yen. Market participants said there wasn't a specific reason for the gains other than optimism consumer spending will continue to increase as Japan stimulates its economy.    In the banking group, Industrial Bank of Japan sprinted ahead 90 yen to 4,880 yen, and Bank of Tokyo was up 20 yen to 1,750 yen.    Frankfurt share prices closed mostly lower in slow trading. Brokers said uncertainty in the international financial markets about the Venice summit and the after-effect of Monday's holiday kept activities at a bare minimum.    A drop of the dollar below the key level of 1.80 deutsche marks demonstrated the general market opinion that the summit won't produce a sustained recovery of the dollar that could help the troubled West German export industry, brokers said.    Stocks in export-dependent sectors had the largest losses, but most price changes were small and often incidental, brokers said. Because there weren't many buyers, even small sell orders from foreign investors were enough to push selected blue-chips    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
