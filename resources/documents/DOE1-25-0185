Among these, 300 have a power of more than30 kW each and represent half of the total power. The heat pumps aremainly used for wood drying, thermovinification, heating of green housesand malting. Market forecasts, favourable for several classical or newindustrial applications, are being strengthened by technological innovations.</TEXT></DOC>
