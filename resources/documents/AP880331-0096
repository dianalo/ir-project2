(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A lawyer for surrogate mother Mary BethWhitehead-Gould says Baby M will be better equipped to deal withher future if she continues to grow up knowing her natural mother.   ``The best interest of this child is plainly to continue thepresent relationship. It's a good relationship. Let's make itbetter. Let's go to work,'' attorney Joel Siegal said Wednesday inclosing arguments in the Baby M visitation hearing.   But an attorney for the child's father, William Stern, and hiswife Elizabeth, said the 2-year-old girl has an excellentrelationship with the Tenafly couple that should not be disruptedby visitation for at least five years.   ``She doesn't need two mothers when a functional mother andfather are everything this child needs,'' Frank Donahue said in hissummation.   The 1{ hours of closing arguments brought to an end a long andbitter courtroom fight for the child, now legally known as MelissaStern. The decision on visitation now rests with Superior CourtJudge Birger W. Sween, whose ruling is not expected before nextweek.   The dispute began after the child was born on March 27, 1986,and Mrs. Whitehead-Gould reneged on a surrogacy contract with theSterns. It climaxed with an unprecedented Feb. 3 New Jersey SupremeCourt decision that outlawed surrogacy for pay.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, 30, who currently sees her daughter duringtwo-hour, supervised visits once a week, said she wants``meaningful'' and gradually expanded visitation.   The Sterns have custody and want to delay Mrs. Whitehead-Gould'svisitation rights.   Siegal warned the judge Wednesday that to reject immediatevisitation would go against the intent of the New Jersey SupremeCourt ruling and ``by indirection we are enforcing the surrogacycontract.''   Siegal said Wednesday that gradually expanded visitation by Mrs.Whitehead-Gould is in Melissa's best interest.   ``She will be better equipped to go forward and deal withlife,'' he said.   Siegal said both sides should undergo counseling to heal woundsand ensure a smooth visitation schedule.   But Donahue rejected counseling.   ``It's pie in the sky,'' Donahue said. ``It just doesn't happenin our experience.''   Donahue also said that Mrs. Whitehead-Gould may try to exploitthe child. He cited Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's decision to sellpictures of her wedding with Wall Street accountant Dean Gould for$20,000 to the Star magazine, a supermarket tabloid.   ``One wonders what price a picture of Melissa would bring,''Donahue said.</TEXT></DOC>
