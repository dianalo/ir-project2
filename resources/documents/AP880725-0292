Customer complaints about inaccurate, incomplete and late billshave plagued the nation's third-largest long-distance company sinceit was formed in July 1986 and have contributed to its losses.   In a letter last week to US Sprint President Robert H. Snedaker,the FCC said it was concerned about the volume of billingcomplaints it has received from US Sprint customers and thecompany's ``inadequate and inaccurate responses.''   While other carriers have experienced billing complaints, theyusually correct the problem within two to three months, said theletter, signed by Gerald Brock, the FCC's top telephone official.   ``In US Sprint's case, however, various billing and relatedproblems have been occurring for well over a year,'' Brock said.``These problems have been compounded by US Sprint's apparentinability to promptly rectify complaints either when a customerdirectly contacts US Sprint or when the customer contacts thecommission.''   The FCC gave Sprint 20 days to explain the procedures it has inplace to investigate complaints forwarded by the FCC and what stepsit intends to respond to these complaints within the 30 daysrequired by law.   US Sprint officials had no comment Monday on the letter.Previously, the company has blamed the billing errors on computerproblems and has said it was bringing the foulups under control.   Greg Vogt, chief of the FCC's telephone enforcement unit, saidthe agency received 1,821 complaints against Sprint between Oct. 1,1986, and July 14, but said ``we would be seeing the tip of theiceberg of what Sprint sees'' in complaints directly from customers.   During the same period, the FCC received 1,114 complaintsagainst American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and 494 against MCICommunications Corp., he said.   ATandamp;T, the nation's largest long-distance company, says it servesabout 70 percent of the interstate long-distance market, while MCIclaims about 10 percent and Sprint about 6 percent.   Vogt said the FCC, if not satisfied with Sprint's efforts tomake timely responses to complaints, could fine the company as muchas $2,000 per violation, up to a total of $20,000.   Last week, GTE Corp. announced it was selling most of its 50percent stake in US Sprint to its partner in the venture, UnitedTelecommunications Inc. United Telecom will raise its stake in USSprint to 80.1 percent early next year.   US Sprint lost $138 million in the first quarter of 1988 afterracking up losses of $800 million last year. The two parents haveshared those losses equally.</TEXT></DOC>
