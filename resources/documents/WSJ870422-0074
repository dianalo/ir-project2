JacobsStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TAXES </IN><TEXT>   In the past few weeks, some taxpayers have received an advance look at their probable 1987 and 1988 tax bills, courtesy of their accountants or financial planners. And they don't like what they see.    Although the writers of the new tax law stressed that the average person's bill would decrease about 6%, many people are beginning to realize that they won't benefit personally. In fact, their tax liabilities will increase -- in some cases substantially -- in 1987 and abate only slightly in 1988.    &quot;I just didn't think it would be that dramatic,&quot; Dawn McNerny of Richfield, Ohio, says of the $3,000 tax increase that she and her husband, Ralph, face this year. Even in 1988 -- when new, lower rates take effect -- the couple will pay an estimated $1,500 more than in 1986, she says.    Mrs. McNerny, a certified public accountant, says they had been deducting sales tax on the materials for a house they are building, had contributed heavily to a 401(k) retirement plan, had used the two-earner deduction for married couples and the deduction for individual retirement accounts. They had also benefited from a favorable rate on capital gains from a mutual fund. Under the new tax law, those deductions are now reduced or eliminated.    Far from being an extreme case, the McNernys illustrate what is happening to many middle-income taxpayers. These people had no tax shelters, as that word is normally understood. They just had an unlucky combination of deductions -- ones that are being phased out, trimmed back, or repealed outright. Their ranks include a heavy sprinkling of teachers, truck drivers, sales people, single parents with small children and two-income couples with heavy consumer debt.    &quot;A lot of people are surprised because tax reform was talked about as being tax reduction,&quot; says Joan Stolpen, a lawyer in Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s tax-advisory group.    The surprise may be particularly shattering for people who prepare their own returns. Unlike those who are receiving some advance warning from financial planners or accountants, people who do their own taxes probably won't find out until they file that their taxes are going up, not down.    &quot;A year from now when people start doing their own taxes you will see them crawling the walls,&quot; says Mary Woolsey, a financial planner in San Leandro, Calif., for Minneapolis-based IDS Financial Services Inc.    That many middle-income taxpayers will be paying more shouldn't come as a complete surprise. Projections made by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation last year when the new law was enacted indicated that more than 37% of taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of $50,000 to $75,000 would pay more in 1988 than under the old rules.    &quot;We said throughout the debate that tax sophisticates would end up paying more, and plain vanilla taxpayers less,&quot; says an aide to Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. &quot;If they're sophisticated enough to have a financial planner and they're paying more,&quot; the staff member adds, &quot;then I think what we predicted has come to pass.&quot;    Such warnings, however, often received scant attention. Not surprisingly, Congressional tax writers emphasized the news that the majority of taxpayers would receive tax cuts. &quot;They certainly put the best gloss&quot; on the statistics, says Ira H. Shapiro, director of tax policy for accountants Coopers andamp; Lybrand.    Although the biggest losers were expected to be the rich and those with extensive tax shelters, many of those now facing higher tax liabilities are people who would hardly consider themselves out-of-the ordinary. And even some who paid attention to the debate over curbs on deductions for individual retirement accounts and consumer-debt interest are being jolted by the impact on their own tax bills.    &quot;We make a good income, but it's taking two of us working full time, no kids, to do that,&quot; says Cindy Gottschalk, a nurse from Pleasanton, Calif. Together, she and her husband, Lyle, an auto-body repairman, earn about $75,000 a year. Their income-tax bill is projected to jump about $600 this year and remain above the 1986 level in 1988, they say.    The main reason for the increase is the couple's inability to continue to write off consumer-debt payments. They owe $25,400 on car loans and credit cards. The Gottschalks are also losing deductions for the cost of their uniforms and Mr. Gottschalk's tools, as well as the IRA and married-couple deductions.    Other taxpayers are being hurt by changes in business deductions. Hildegard Byrne, a divorced mother of two, sells advertising for radio station WWWE in Cleveland. Paid a salary and commission, she is expected to pick up most of her own expenses, including dinners, drinks, and tickets to professional football and baseball games for prospective advertisers. Previously, she could deduct such nonreimbursed business expenses in full. Now, such costs are deductible only to the extent they exceed 2% of her gross income. Even then, only 80% of business entertainment can be written off. The result: She expects to pay more taxes in 1987 and 1988.    Some taxpayers might be able to mitigate the damages. Some, for instance, can reduce their taxable income by deferring a portion of their salaries into employer-sponsored 401(k) retirement plans -- though there are now tighter limits on contributions to such plans.    Others might shift some of their investment portfolio into tax-exempt municipal bonds or mutual funds. Those hit hard by the smaller deduction for consumer interest might pay off their credit-card debt with a home-equity loan, which remains largely deductible under the new tax law. But planners warn against piling up too much debt on a home, since losing a home is worse than defaulting on credit-card debt or a car loan.    Easy ways out, then, may be hard to come by. The changes in the tax law will mean changes in living habits for some people.    For Barbara Gaydick, a teacher for 27 years, the new law means spending less on books and gifts for her physical-education students and the girls' field-hockey teams she has coached to county championships at Northern Valley Regional High School in Old Tappan, N.J.    Like many teachers and coaches, Ms. Gaydick has been deducting as unreimbursed employee business expenses the cost of continuing education, books and magazines, and use of her car for work-related activities. She has also been writing off things like bagels and orange juice brought to Saturday practices and other items purchased to boost morale or reward performance.    The 49-year-old teacher says she deducted about $1,500 of such expenses on her 1986 return. Because she is single and a renter, she says, &quot;Nonreimbursed expenses is the biggest thing for me.&quot;    Under the new tax law, however, Ms. Gaydick will be able to deduct less than half of those expenses. Coupled with the loss of the $2,000 IRA deduction, that will result in tax increases for her this year and next, her accountant says. The new law, she complains, &quot;is so unfair to people in the middle-income level.&quot;    ---             How Many Will Pay More?
