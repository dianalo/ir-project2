The $150 million sale by Mellon Bank, Barclays Bank andBank of Montreal is the first highly leveraged transactionsale structured as a security since last spring. It isconsidered a good omen for similar deals this year that willallow banks to sell their loans to non-bank investors.Structured as securities, the loan pools can be rated bycredit-rating concerns, making them attractive toinstitutional investors.</LP><TEXT>   Large banks, which have about $50 billion of highlyleveraged loans on their books from leveraged buy-outs andrestructurings in the late 1980s, are eager to reduce theirexposure in the area because of the stigma attached to theloan category by the credit markets. But it had been fearedthat the worsening economy would limit the loan-resale marketto other banks, which are more interested in swapping loansthan in increasing their exposures.   &quot;This bodes well for the future sale of pools of loans,&quot;said Christopher Snyder, president of Loan Pricing Corp.,which publishes and analyzes loans. &quot;It means there is agroup of non-bank investors attracted to bank loans, andbanks are getting better at structuring the loan pools tomesh with their {investors'} needs.&quot;   With the Mellon-led deal, it's estimated that the volumeof the loans pooled in this way is now about $2.5 billion,including a $1 billion package of highly leveragedtransaction loans put together by Nomura Securities lastspring. Banks began pooling such loans only a few years ago.   Mellon acted as coordinating agent for Freedom Finance 11,the most recent leveraged-loan deal. It consisted of threeclasses of floating-rate notes, all backed by a pool of 27loans. One of the classes, rated single-A-minus by Standard andamp;Poor's Corp., was for $126 million; another, rated double-B,was for $8 million; and a third, unrated, was for $16million.   Michael Bryson, senior vice president in charge ofmerchant banking of Mellon, said the issues were placedprivately with overseas investors, mostly Japaneseinstitutions brought in by a unit of Industrial Bank of Japanthat underwrote the $126 million tranche.   He said, &quot;We felt that, in this market, to be successfulwe had to limit the number of banks selling the loans.&quot; Inmost past deals, more than three banks were involved inselling their loans in such a way.   Loan buyers were attracted to the deal because the poolingof the loans diversified risk, said Michael Robinson, asenior manager of the Bank of Montreal. This particularlyappealed to smaller Japanese institutions that don't have theresources to analyze individual U.S. corporate loans, hesaid.   In addition, the yield of asset-backed securitiestypically is &quot;a tad better&quot; than that of a single issue ofthe same credit quality. For the $126 millionsingle-A-minus-rated class of the loan pool, the rate offeredinvestors was 0.75 percentage point above the Londoninterbank offered rate. For the unrated $16 million portion,investors would receive at least 5 1/8 points more than Liborif all the loans in the pool were paid on schedule. Thatclass of the security, however, would have its returndiminished each time one of the 27 loans in the pooldefaulted, said Mr. Robinson.   Mr. Bryson said he and other banks are looking intosecuritizing specific pools of loans to cable-televisioncompanies that are designated as highly leveragedtransactions.   New highly leveraged transactions are few and far between,partly because of a lack of junk bond financing for leveragedbuy-out deals but also because banks must publish theirexposure to highly leveraged transactions each quarter. Theextent of the slowdown in such lending is seen in comparisonsof third-quarter volume: In 1990, 41 transactions for $5.8billion were completed, down sharply from 103 transactions in1989 totaling $28.2 billion, according to Loan Pricing'sfigures.   The good news for the banks that had built up largeinfrastructures to handle leveraged lending is that new loansare being made at more profitable interest rates than before.   &quot;The banks are getting better-paid for risk,&quot; said StevenMiller, an analyst with Loan Pricing. He said the averagehighly leveraged transaction loan, syndicated among eight ormore banks, costs corporations 0.75 percentage point more nowthan a year ago.   &quot;Deals are finally getting better pricing,&quot; saidChristopher Ryan, a trader with Salomon Brothers, which buysand sells highly leveraged transaction loans. &quot;It means theymay be more eager to originate them.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
