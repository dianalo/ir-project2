Sandamp;P said the review of the current triple-C-plus rating on convertible subordinated debentures due 2010 reflects Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Atari Corp.'s agreement to buy Federated for $67.3 million. Federated, based in Commerce, Calif., would have its rating raised to the single-B-minus level of Atari's subordinated debt when the transaction is complete, Sandamp;P said. It said Atari's ratings aren't under surveillance because it is expected that Atari can finance the transaction without substantial new borrowing.    ---   IMPERIAL OIL LTD. -- Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it raised its rating on about 312 million Canadian dollars ($236.9 million) of debt of Canada's largest oil company to triple-A from double-A. Exxon Corp. owns 70% of the Toronto-based oil and gas concern. The rating concern cited the &quot;resilience&quot; of Imperial's cash flow last year, its conservative capital structure and the financial flexibility afforded by Exxon's stake. The company's executive vice president and chief financial officer, Bill Young, said higher oil prices this year and the Sandamp;P move &quot;strengthen Imperial's ability to pursue investment opportunities in the development of Canadian oil and gas.&quot;    ---   KANSAS GAS andamp; ELECTRIC CO. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. boosted its rating on this Wichita, Kan.-based utility's first mortgage and secured pollution control revenue bonds to Baa-1 from Baa-2. Also upgraded were the following: unsecured pollution control bonds, to Baa-2 from Baa-3; preferred stock, to Baa-2 from Baa-3; and a prospective first mortgage shelf registration, to provisional Baa-1 from provisional Baa-2. About $390 million of securities is affected. Moody's cited KGandamp;E's recently approved rate stabilization plan and its proposed sale and leaseback of a 50% stake in a coal plant. The utility said the rating change &quot;reinforces the confidence in KGandamp;E's management and in the steps we've taken in the last year&quot; to stabilize rates and cash flow.    ---   SUNSHINE MINING CO. -- Sandamp;P said it put about $80 million of debt of the Dallas-based mining and oil and gas concern on its CreditWatch list with positive implications. Sunshine's subordinated debt is rated triple-C-minus. The rating concern cited improved earnings and Sunshine's current financial restructuring. Sunshine said prices for its products are rising and that it has reduced debt by about $70 million, to $180 million, and plans to reduce it at least an additional $90 million over the next few months. </TEXT></DOC>
