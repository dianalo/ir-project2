Perkins, 60, said the most disappointing events of his tenurewere the continuation of the government's state of emergency tocontrol anti-apartheid protests, the banning of 17 activist groupsand the large numbers of people who are arrested and held withoutcharge under the government's emergency powers.   Perkins was a strong critic of such developments during histenure. Although the embassy repeatedly condemned restrictions onthe press, Perkins gave no on-the-record interviews during histenure until last week, when he talked to two South Africannewspapers.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.   State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrictreporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment ofdetainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range of statementsthe government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulationshas not been comprehensive.   Perkins said, ``South Africa is moving through a transition to adifferent kind of country, to one where the majority populationwill have a decisive say in how they are governed, to a SouthAfrica in which the majority will participate in and benefit fromthe wealth of its economy.''   Perkins has been appointed director-general of the ForeignService, which is subject to Senate confirmation.</TEXT></DOC>
