(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A huge thunderstorm forced the AirForce to postpone the launch of an advanced navigation satellitefor a second time Sunday night.   The launch was rescheduled for Tuesday at 7:43 p.m. Officialsdecided to stand down 48 hours because Monday's weather forecastwas not favorable and the launch team needed a rest period, saidLt. Col. Ron Rand, the Air Force launch commentator.   ``The weather is bad and getting worse,'' Rand said. ``There isa thunderstorm, an anvil cloud and lightning within five miles ofthe launch pad. The lightning requires a shutdown of the rocketguidance computer.''   As he spoke, a huge black cloud rolled over Cape Canaveral fromthe northwest, rain poured down and lightning crackled over thearea.   The postponement was announced 40 minutes before the plannedliftoff of the Delta 2 rocket at 7:51 p.m.   The launch was first postponed Saturday night because of strongwinds above the launch pad. The countdown clock then stood at 4minutes.   The Delta 2 carries a $65 million Navstar satellite that willenable military units such as ships, planes, submarines and tanksto determine their location within 50 feet and in some cases towithin 10 feet anywhere around the globe.</TEXT></DOC>
