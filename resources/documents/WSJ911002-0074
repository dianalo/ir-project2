The new studies, combined with several others in the pastyear, suggest that scientists may have found an inborn genedefect that, if inherited with other genes, can make somepeople vulnerable to alcoholism and other problems.</LP><TEXT>   The studies focus on a gene that makes a &quot;receptor&quot;protein on the surface of nerve cells and helps a chemicalcalled dopamine carry electrical messages between the cells.The gene actually produces one of two versions of thereceptor, dubbed A1. Early last year, two scientists foundthe A1 gene prevalent in brain cells of deceased alcoholics,and much less common in cells taken from non-alcoholics.   In today's Journal of the American Medical Association,researchers at Veterans Affairs Medical Center, West Haven,Conn.; University of Connecticut and Yale University, saidthey were unable to find a difference in the prevalence ofthe A1 gene in alcoholics and non-alcoholics in blood teststhey conducted in over 100 people.   But in the same issue, geneticists at City of Hope MedicalCenter, Duarte, Calif., said that in their experiments, theyfound the A1 gene more common in people with alcoholism; inTourette's syndrome and autism, two nerve disorders; and alearning and behavioral problem called attention deficitdisorder.   The chief author of the City of Hope study, David Comings,said the research strongly suggests that the A1 gene isn'tthe principal cause for the health problems, but instead is a&quot;modifying&quot; gene that somehow makes worse the effects of someas yet unidentified genes. Dr. Comings said because the geneplays a secondary role in inheriting a susceptibility to thediseases, he wasn't surprised that some scientists are havingtrouble consistently finding the gene in test subjects.   Last December, a team of government scientists were unableto detect that families with alcoholism passed along the A1gene. In July, however, researchers at Washington University,St. Louis, found the A1 gene more common in blood tests fromalcoholics than in non-alcoholics, although theseresearchers, too, were unable to detect a pattern ofinheritance.   In an effort to make sense of the contradictory findingsof the past few months, C. Robert Cloninger, a leadingresearcher in alcoholism and genetics, analyzed six studiesof the A1 gene, including the two newest ones. By combiningdata from the studies, he found that 45% of 338 alcoholicshad the gene, compared with 27% of 471 similar people withoutthe problem. In an editorial also in today's Journal of theAmerican Medical Association, Dr. Cloninger, chairman of thedepartment of psychiatry at Washington University, said theA1 gene does seem to be a modifying gene, playing asupporting role in inheriting an inclination towardalcoholism.   Researchers believe A1 may cause problems because thereceptor it produces is either in short supply or doesn'twork well, perhaps requiring stimulation from alcohol ordrugs to effectively carry nerve impulses between nervecells. If A1 is involved, scientists believe they may be ableto use it to predict, and perhaps help prevent, alcoholism.But such a test is years away. The research findings, ifstrengthened, also may give further credence to inheritanceas a factor in the disease.</TEXT></DOC>
