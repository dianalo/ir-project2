Seven weeks later, Wright and his colleagues are being asked tocount again. Most seem unwilling to do that.   ``Will something get done this year? I doubt it,'' HouseMajority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said Wednesday. ``Somethingneeds to be done but I'm not at all optimistic. And next year is anelection year; it's even worse.''   Coelho, the Democrats' chief vote counter, was reacting to a newraise proposal by a commission that studied the salaries of membersof Congress, federal judges and senior government executives.President Bush welcomed the recommendations and said he would soonoffer specific proposals to the Congress.   The commission, headed by former Federal Reserve Chairman PaulVolcker, proposed raises of approximately 50 percent over twoyears, not much different than the package killed last month aftera firestorm of citizen opposition.   Rank-and-file members of Congress now are paid $89,500 a year; a50 percent raise would boost congressional salaries to $135,000.   Capitol Hill's initial reaction could best be summed up as``thanks but no thanks.''   Hardly a surprise, given the events of late January and earlyFebruary, following a proposal that congressional salaries beraised by 51 percent.   Opponents, notably radio talk show hosts, took little note ofthe fact that the package also covered judges and managers of manyof the government's most important and sensitive programs. Thenation's anger was directed at Congress.   The talk show hosts and their callers portrayed the lawmakers asgreedy do-nothings. Angry constituents flooded the Capitol mailroom with letters and tea bags to protest. Polls showedoverwhelming public opposition to the raises, which were due totake effect automatically.   Facing all that, Wright decided the pay plan should go to avote. The outcome was as inevitable as death and taxes.   Afterward, Wright said it was time to move on. Bush seemed toconcur.   ``What you don't want to do is come in and when the wounded arestill lying on the battlefield start fighting another battle,'' hesaid then.   Bush apparently believes now that the wounds have already healed.   Coelho said Bush's leadership is vital to any hopes of passingpay raises for members of Congress, federal judges and governmentexecutives. But he quickly added that the president would have toget Republicans in line before the Democratic leadership wouldembrace a new pay plan.   ``Everybody does their own thing around here instead of doingwhat is in the best interests of the institution,'' Coelho said.``You can get a lot of mileage out of opposing pay hikes if you'rethinking about running for the Senate from Iowa.''   That was a shot at Rep. Thomas Tauke, R-Iowa, a leading opponentof the pay raises voted down last month.   Coelho didn't say it, but hopes of winning a pay raise couldrest on getting Ralph Nader in line too.   Nader led the talk show assault on the last pay raise packageand was quick to criticize the new one.   ``President Bush should apply his flexible freeze philosophy tothe salaries of top government officials,'' the self-styledconsumer advocate said.   Coelho, asked if any new attempt at pay raises would likely meetthe same fate as the last, replied:   ``Sure. The Ralph Naders and the talk show hosts will prevail,''   It's not that a majority of the lawmakers don't think theydeserve a hefty raise.   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., drew a standing ovation lastmonth when he insisted, ``Each member of the House, Democrat andRepublican, is worth $135,000.''   The question now is whether enough of the lawmakers think it'sworth trying again to convince the American public of that.   Coelho doubts it.   ``I count the votes and I don't count enough of them on eitherside of the aisle,'' he said. ``We have a tendency to shootourselves in the foot. We certainly have on this one.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITORS: John King covers labor for The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
