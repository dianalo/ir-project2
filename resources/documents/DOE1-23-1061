Each of thesetechnologies places particular demands on the He II coolant. Understandingthe impact of these demands on system operation is the goal of severalongoing research efforts. The present paper reviews the current understandingof He II as it applies to these systems. Subjects to be addressed include:heat transfer and stability limits in He II cooled magnet system, HeII containment under zero gravity and fluid dynamics of He II transferin space.</TEXT></DOC>
