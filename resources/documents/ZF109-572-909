 Using older technologiescosts more than using new ones and also limits employeecapabilities.andP;  Employees should take it upon themselves to upgradetheir skills in order to design better products as well as to holdon to their jobs.andP;  Government agencies should pay part of the costand allocate time for training but systems professionals shouldnot just wait for their agency to train them.andP;  Employees shouldstudy the computer press, take advanced technology courses atlocal colleges, buy a microcomputer for home use to learn newtechniques and use their own money and leave time to attend newtechnology conferences and seminars.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     New TechniqueTraining of EmployeesJob SecurityCritiqueGovernment Agency.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Old Dogs Are Better Off With New Tricks As a young child, I used to watch aperformer on the boardwalk guess people's ages.andP;  I was amazed time after timeas this performer came within one or two years of a person's age.andP;  To me,people were simply young, middle-aged or old.andP;  Obviously, there was somethingI didn't know about age guessing.andM;When I grew up I went to work for a large data processing department.andP;  Iwatched technology change, and I watched people join the department and movethrough the ranks.andP;  Along the way, I began to be able to guess when peoplehad joined the department.andP;  Like the boardwalk performer, I amazed mycolleagues by pinpointing the year in which they had come to work in thedepartment.andM;Here is how I did it.andP;  Instead of looking for age lines, I looked fortechnology preferences.andP;  I learned that people fell in love with thetechnology in existence when they joined the department, and they were veryreluctant to give up that technology for new technology.andM;Let's look at some examples.andP;  When Fred joined the department, sequentialfiles were in.andP;  Fred never liked databases.andP;  Mary joined the year we acquiredIMS.andP;  Mary still considers IMS far superior to DB2.andP;  Pete started designingsystems with our systems development methodology and is having troubleconverting to data modeling.andM;To guess correctly when someone joined the department, you need to list thetechnologies and know when the technology was acquired.andP;  For example, whenMary expresses her preference for IMS over DB2, you need only a few moretechnological questions, and you have found when she got her start in dataprocessing.andM;Today, information processing is at a technological crossroads.andP;  There is amajor revolution occurring in how we do our work.andP;  Among the significantchanges that are under way:andM;We are moving from a people-dependent to a process-dependent activity.andP;  Up tonow, most organizations were totally dependent on the project staff to builda high-quality system.andP;  The introduction of computer-aided softwareengineering (CASE) technology is changing that.andM;Users are demanding high reliability in systems.andP;  The current level ofdefects in operational systems is no longer acceptable.andM;There is a new emphasis on customer satisfaction.andP;  Just meeting specs is nolonger good enough.andP;  End users have alternatives for acquiring or buildingsystems if your ADP organization cannot satisfy their needs.andP;  Out-sourcing isa significant concept for the 1990s.andM;In this environment, Mary has to give up her love affair with IMS.andP;  Pete hasto use data modeling, and Fred must use databases.andM;Many information managers I talk to are concerned about their inability toconvince their staff of the need to retrain and upgrade their skills.andP;  Thisunwillingness to invest personal time and effort in retraining is a problemfor two reasons.andM;First, using older technologies costs more than using newer ones.andP;  Second,the older technologies limit capabilities.andP;  Couple this with the fact thatmost older employees earn more than new employees, and you can begin tosuspect what is happening in many organizations.andM;It no longer is rare to find organizations replacing the older employees withnew ones.andP;  This is not unique to information processing.andP;  Employers of allkinds are turning to early retirement programs, reductions in force, layoffsand out-sourcing.andP;  These are direct results of a work force improperlytrained for today's technology.andM;What's the solution for old dogs?andP;  The answer is to learn new tricks.andM;How can that happen in an era of budget cutting, reduced training and, inmany cases, decisions to postpone acquisition of new technologies to avoidincurring costs?andP;  The old dogs can take it upon themselves to upgrade theirskills.andP;  This means:andM;* Carefully studying the computer press.andP;  Read Government Computer News coverto cover to find out what's happening.andM;* Taking advanced technology courses at local colleges and universities.andM;* Reading books on new technology on your own time.andM;* Buying a personal computer for home use as a means of learning new ways ofprocessing.andM;* Using your annual leave and your own money to attend conferences andseminars on new technology and concepts.andM;When I was a supervisor in a large corporation, my employees often sought toattend training sessions.andM;The staff took the attitude that training and keeping abreast of technologywas a responsibility of the organization, not the individual.andP;  I didn't thinkso then, and I don't think so now.andM;Old dogs, if they want to retain their jobs, if they want to advance, if theywant to be competitive in the marketplace, better learn new technology.andM;This does not mean that government agencies shouldn't pay part of the cost,and shouldn't allocate time for training.andP;  It does mean that systemsprofessionals should not sit back and wait for their agency to train them.andM;William E.
