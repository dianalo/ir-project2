(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Illinois Senate shot down a packageof measures that would have toughened handgun laws and imposed alimited ban on semiautomatic assault weapons.   By a 2-1 margin, lawmakers Thursday defeated bills requiringhandgun owners to register their weapons with state police, obtainidentification cards, and notify authorities of change of address.   The Senate fell two votes short of banning semiautomatic weaponsusing magazines or ammunition belts containing more than 10 rounds.California recently enacted a similar ban.   ``People are more concerned with the will of the National RifleAssociation than they are of the desires of their ownconstituents,'' said William Marovitz, one of two sponsors of thebills.   Sen. David Barkhausen said the bill's proposal to register theguns would have cost $7.6 million and created a bureaucraticnightmare.   Currently, people may own any type of firearm with a singlefirearm owner's identification card. The rejected measure wouldhave required a separate card for handguns.   The Senate did approve a measure sponsored by Marovitz thatwould allow revocation of a firearm owner's identification card ifa judge determines that the owner presents a ``clear and presentdanger'' to himself or others.   Another rejected measure would have banned former mentalpatients from owning handguns.   Gun control advocates had hoped their efforts would gain afterincidents like the shooting spree last May 20 in a Winnetkaelementary school.
