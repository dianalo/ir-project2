The average number of passengers carried Friday on the shuttlelinking Boston, New York and Washington was between 25 and 35,according to an Air Line Pilots Association news release. OnThursday, Eastern flew 60 shuttle flights, with some carrying asfew as three or four passengers, the release said.   Most of Eastern's 3,600 pilots, along with flight attendants,have refused to cross picket lines as the Machinists strike againstthe airline entered its fourth week Saturday.   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the airline does notrelease passenger-load figures specifically for the shuttle,although it had a monthly traffic report for all its flights.   But she said the holiday weekend was not a peak time for theshuttle, which caters to business travelers, and loads had beenlight ever since the strike started March 4.   ``We're running a good reliable product in the shuttle,'' Ms.Ceremsak said. ``It's a shame that an organization that claims tobe professional like ALPA is busy trying to drive a stake throughthe heart of a great airline.''   The Miami-based carrier on Friday raised ticket prices to theiroriginal $99 daily and $69 weekend one-way fares after cuttingfares to as low as $12.   Meanwhile, a Miami judge scheduled a hearing Monday on Eastern'srequest to order the pilots back to work.   On Friday, a three-judge appeals panel ordered U.S. DistrictJudge Edward Davis in Miami to determine if the walkout by pilotsis a sympathy strike or a de facto strike to press their owncontract demands. Davis earlier had refused to issue a ruling,saying he lacked authority.   ``The claim of a sympathy strike cannot be used a a pretext toshield conduct that otherwise would be a clear violation of theRailway Labor Act,'' the appeals court said.   Davis could order the pilots back to work if he finds theycalled a strike over their own contract demands without havingexhausted all collective bargaining options required under theRailway Labor Act.   Three weeks after Eastern's 8,500-member Machinists unionstruck, the airline continues operating just a small fraction ofits pre-strike schedule of 1,040 flights. The carrier is presentlyoperating only its Northeast shuttle and Latin American routeswhile it attempts to rebuild under Chapter 11 bankruptcyproceedings.   The trustee of the New York bankruptcy court that is hearing theEastern case next week will appoint an examiner who will have thedual role of investigator and mediator.   ``I think this is an examiner who has all the authority exceptfor operating the business,'' said Harry Jones, the court trusteein New York.   The examiner will, among other things, probe union allegationsthat Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent, damaged the carrier bystripping it of assets such as its reservations systems, planes andvarious routes and airport facilities.   The examiner also could become involved with Eastern's unioncontracts in an attempt to remove obstacles to the carrier'srebuilding plans.   ``It's conceivable he could come back and say the parties are atan impasse,'' said Harvey Miller, Eastern's bankruptcy lawyer. ``Hecould come back and say Texas Air is irresponsible, or the unionsare irresponsible.''   Meanwhile, disappointed band members at two Cincinnati highschools hoped to recover $30,900 they deposited with a Miami travelagency that canceled their trip to Mexico because of the strike.   Sixty-eight students from the suburban Greenhills and ForestPark high schools, along with 17 parents and teachers, stagedfund-raisers for the concert trip to Merida, Mexico, during thespring school break.   The owner of the travel firm has apparently agreed to return themoney.</TEXT></DOC>
