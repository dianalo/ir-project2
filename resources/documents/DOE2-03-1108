In addition,these results were correlated with sonographic and computed tomographicfindings of the liver in selected patients. Twenty-seven patients withprimary liver tumors were examined with celiac or selective hepatic arteriography.Sonography was performed in 15 and computed tomography in 15 of the 27patients. Angiographic criteria for malignancy or benignancy were established.These findings were correlated with computed tomographic and sonographicfindings of the liver vascularity in selected patients. The final pathologicdiagnosis was established surgically or by percutaneous biopsy. Sonographyand computed tomography can be used as the initial procedure for evaluatingtumor size, location and hepatic vascularity. However, the exact vascularanatomy demonstrated by angiography in children is more accurate andis often needed prior to surgical resection of primary liver tumors.</TEXT></DOC>
