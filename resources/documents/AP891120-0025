The House gave the measure final congressional approval by avoice vote on Sunday. It cuts $1.1 billion from Bush's $4.9 billionfiscal 1990 proposal for SDI, the first budget reduction in theStar Wars program in six years.   Among other provisions is a cut of $400 million from theadministration's $1.8 billion request for procurement of theTrident 2 missile and $11 million from Bush's proposal of $216million for testing the problem-plagued missile.   In August, the Trident 2 had its second successive failure inundersea test firings, exploding seconds after being launched froma nuclear submarine off the coast of Florida.   Concerned about the troubled weapon, Congress agreed to prohibitspending more than $250 million on the program until threesuccessful test flights have occurred.   The legislation provides $4.3 billion for two B-2 stealthbombers, $430 million and one plane less than the administrationsought in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The money also will beused for some advance procurement costs for five planes to bepurchased in fiscal 1991, and for spare parts.   Approximately $1.1 billion is included for the multiple-warhead,rail-based MX and the single-warhead, truck-based Midgetman nuclearmissiles. The amount is about $150 million less than theadministration requested for the two weapons and includes Houselanguage imposing a 50-missile cap on the MX.   The legislation provides for the Navy's F-14D Tomcat jet fighterand the Army Helicopter Improvement Program _ for one more year _and postpones a decision on the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey and thePhoenix missile.</TEXT></DOC>
