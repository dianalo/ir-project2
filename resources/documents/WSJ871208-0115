CohenStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MARKETING, ADVERTISING (MKT)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><TEXT>   A new Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. television commercial is long on promotion of the securities commonly known as &quot;junk&quot; bonds. But some fudging of the facts may undermine the campaign. &quot;In 1983,&quot; the ad explains, &quot;over 16% of the population of Vidalia, La., were unemployed . . .    &quot;In December 1986, the Catalyst Energy Corp. began construction on the Vidalia, La., hydroelectric plant, financed with the help of high-yield bonds provided by Drexel Burnham.    &quot;Today, this project has helped reduce unemployment by over 20% -- proof that high-yield bonds are not just good for business, but for everyone.&quot;    Never mind that unemployment statistics specifically for Vidalia don't exist. Or that construction of the hydroelectric plant began in December 1985, not 1986. And what about the quaint little town shown with its pool hall, its Dixie Theatre and the man playing solitaire on the sidewalk? This isn't Vidalia at all; it's Fort Smith, Ark., more than 300 miles away.    &quot;The only theater we ever had in Vidalia was a drive-in picture show blown down by a hurricane,&quot; says Brent Taunton, a dentist who heads the Vidalia Chamber of Commerce.    Drexel denies that there is a problem with its ad and dismisses any mention of the flaws as merely &quot;nitpicking.&quot; What really matters, according to the New York-based investment banking firm, is the message: Drexel and its high-yield bonds -- often used to finance hostile takeovers -- have gotten a bad rap.    &quot;There aren't any misrepresentations in the ad,&quot; says Steven Anreder, a Drexel spokesman. &quot;The only thing I can't quarrel with is that it was not shot in Vidalia. The other stuff is all minor stuff.&quot;    For more than a year, Drexel has been beleaguered by negative publicity as the subject of an intensive federal investigation stemming from the insider-trading scandal involving Ivan Boesky. Lately, the firm has been fighting back with a media blitz designed to boost its flagging image. In addition to more than a half dozen print ads placed in newspapers and magazines, some $4 million is being spent on a TV campaign, which features two 60-second commercials that began airing last month. Another two are planned for early next year.    Other investment banking firms, including E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. and Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., have advertised on television. But they have mainly used commercials to get new business for their retail brokerage operations. Drexel's TV ads, by contrast, &quot;are not new-business ads,&quot; concedes Frederick Joseph, Drexel's chief executive. &quot;Clearly, these are image ads.    &quot;We think it's useful,&quot; Mr. Joseph continues, &quot;for everyone to understand that we're not all yuppies shuffling paper here on Wall Street. We want people to understand that these bonds create employment and cheap electricity and do things that are beneficial.&quot; The ads are also intended, he explains, to show that Drexel has more to offer than just junk bonds.    In the other current TV commercial, for example, Drexel is portrayed as the savior of California's schoolchildren. The rising cost of liability insurance, says the ad (which was also filmed in Fort Smith), threatened to close parks and playgrounds in that state, &quot;ultimately making it very hard for a five-year-old to be a five-year-old.&quot; However, it points out, in 1987 &quot;money was raised to pay the liability insurance. . . . Financing was secured with municipal bonds provided by Drexel.&quot;    Mr. Joseph says that Drexel's ad agency, Los Angeles-based Chiat/Day Inc., had tried for &quot;a couple of years&quot; to get the firm to promote itself on television. But Drexel relented only several months ago. So far, Mr. Joseph thinks it's a great idea. &quot;They've run at exactly the right moment -- after the presidential debates and during football games,&quot; he says.    But some residents of Vidalia, a town of about 6,000 that borders the Mississippi River, aren't so pleased.    &quot;Oh, don't go by that ad,&quot; says Gay Guercio, a tourist-information counselor who has lived in Vidalia since 1958. Mrs. Guercio recalls that when she first saw the ad, &quot;I thought to myself, I wonder where they shot this. We don't even have a Main Street. We have a busy four-lane highway in the middle of our town.&quot;    Sidney Murray Jr., a former Vidalia mayor who is general manager of hydropower operations at the plant, which bears his name, is concerned about the image of the town that emerges: &quot;They wanted to design an ad that would nail home the point, 'Here we are, and here comes Drexel to save the day.' They couldn't have made us look any worse.&quot; He adds, &quot;We feel like the town was done wrong, and it's our opinion that Chiat/Day -- not Drexel -- was the one who did it.&quot;    Jay Chiat, the chairman of Chiat/Day, says the agency &quot;looked for a location&quot; for the Vidalia ad and &quot;came up with Fort Smith.&quot; He says he sees nothing wrong with that. Indeed, ad agencies often use actors instead of real-life people, and sets instead of real-life places.    Some critics, however, question the decision to do so in this case. Substituting Fort Smith for Vidalia &quot;seems particularly insensitive,&quot; says Roy Grace, chairman of Grace andamp; Rothschild, a New York-based advertising firm. &quot;There are times when you use a location that isn't the actual one, but you should say it's a reenactment,&quot; he adds. (The ad doesn't make any such disclosure.)    What's worse, says Sam Randazzo, Vidalia's mayor, is the portrayal of the town as a &quot;destitute little city with a high unemployment rate. Vidalia never had as high unemployment as the rest of the parish.&quot;    Drexel acknowledges that the unemployment statistics used in the ad are for the whole of Concordia Parish, the population of which is 30,000. But the firm says it was led to believe that those figures were representative of the situation in Vidalia.    Raymond Rabb, the Louisiana Department of Labor official who Drexel says supplied the statistics used in the ad, disputes that claim. &quot;As far as (the hydropower plant's) helping to reduce the unemployment rate by 20%, they might say that, but I wouldn't,&quot; he says. Besides, he adds, &quot;most of the people who work at the hydro plant aren't even from Vidalia.&quot; Mr. Rabb also argues that the drop in unemployment is partly the result of an overall population decline in the area.    Another contention of Drexel's TV ad is that &quot;most investment bankers never heard of the town of Vidalia, let alone want to invest in it.&quot; Well, not exactly.    In 1982, before Catalyst came to Vidalia, investment bankers from at least six Wall Street firms descended on the town, vying to raise money for the plant's construction. Salomon Brothers Inc. was chosen, but its planned underwriting wasn't completed and Vidalia again searched for financing for the $500 million project.    Catalyst, too, introduced Vidalia to a number of investment bankers last year when it sought partial financing for several projects, including the Vidalia plant.    Michael Best, president of construction operations at New York-based Catalyst, reviewed the ad before it ran. &quot;Drexel isn't unfairly burnishing its own star here,&quot; he says. &quot;While other investment banking firms considered&quot; Catalyst's financing needs for the Vidalia plant, &quot;everyone but Drexel walked away, saying it wasn't possible to raise funds for the project.&quot; Mr. Best adds, &quot;Maybe we should have said that instead.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
