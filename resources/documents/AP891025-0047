(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The disorganized coup in Panama wasmuddled by confusion and mixed feelings among officers about theleader they sought to overthrow, said the highest-ranking survivorof the attempt.   Capt. Javier Licona escaped the killings and arrests thatfollowed the collapse of the Oct. 3 coup because he had been sentto Fort Clayton during the operation to ask why U.S. troops hadn'tcut off roads or buzzed airports to block loyalists of Panamanianleader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.   When the coup began to crumble, Licona remained at Fort Clayton,the U.S. base in Panama, and eventually was flown with otherrefugees to the United States.   Licona, 36, talked to reporters Tuesday for the first time sincethe failed coup. He had declined to speak publicly while hearranged for relatives to join him and was interviewed by U.S.officials.   Licona said the coup's leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi, told himU.S. support was promised at a secret meeting the night of Oct. 1.   ``But when I arrived (at Fort Clayton) General Cisneros knewnothing of the support they were supposed to give us,'' Liconasaid. Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros is the top U.S. Army official inPanama.   After a 20-minute phone call with someone, Cisneros gave theorder to block the roads, Licona said.   ``Panamanian military planes had already left to transport inthe troops to support General Noriega. It was too late,'' Liconasaid.   Having seized Noriega during the coup attempt, Giroldi seemedunsure about what to do with him, Licona said.   ``He remained under Noriega's influence ... He had been veryloyal to the general,'' Licona said. Giroldi wanted Noriega toleave power peacefully, but said he could remain in Panama, Liconasaid.   Licona said Giroldi failed to make a clear agreement with Maj.Federico Oleochea, leader of the strongest unit in the capital,Battalion 2000.   ``He told me he was sure Major Oleochea would support us themoment he asked. But he never spoke wwith him concretely about whathe wanted. I never trusted Oleochea,'' he said.   Oleochea eventually joined Noriega in crushing the coup, Liconasaid. Giroldi was slain.</TEXT></DOC>
