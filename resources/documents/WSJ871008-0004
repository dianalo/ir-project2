After drooping for most of the session, shares rallied enough to close mixed yesterday.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 30 points at 3 p.m. EDT. In the final hour of trading, it bounced back to close at 2551.08, up 2.45, despite a boost in the prime rate to 9.25% from 8.75% by several banks.    Most stocks fared worse than the average, however. On the New York Stock Exchange, 1020 issues declined and only 546 advanced. The average Big Board stock (weighting all issues equally) was off 0.47%. On the American Stock Exchange, the average issue lost 0.60% as decliners outnumbered gainers by 412 to 213.    Tuesday, the industrial average declined a record 91.55 points, pushed by waves of computer-directed selling, much of it related to arbitrage against stock-index futures and options. Previously, the largest one-day point loss was 86.61 points on Sept. 11, 1986.    Traders said there was some computer-directed trading yesterday, but much less than on Tuesday. The programs were on the sell side for most of the day, but on the buy side late in the session.    Big Board volume was 186.2 million shares, up a bit from Tuesday's 175.6 million.    &quot;A lot of groups got banged around&quot; in Tuesday's big decline, said Larry Greenwald, co-manager of the equity trading desk at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. With the industrial average down 120 points from Monday's close, &quot;you had some bottom fishing coming in,&quot; he said.    Mr. Greenwald added, &quot;You don't rally 30 points in the blink of an eye without some buy programs.&quot; As for the prime rate increases, he said they had been widely anticipated and so didn't cause much further damage yesterday.    Mario Gabelli, head of Gabelli andamp; Co. in New York, said that investors shouldn't make too much of Tuesday's record point drop. &quot;There's nothing unusual about this. It happens all the time,&quot; he said. He likened the overall movement of the market to that of a stock that had climbed from 8 to 27 between August 1982 and August 1987, and then fallen back to 25.    &quot;Swings of 15% will come more frequently and intensely,&quot; Mr. Gabelli said, partly because so-called portfolio insurance techniques used by institutional investors accentuate volatility. But he said the market is merely becoming about as volatile as it was 25 years ago.    Robert Prechter, whose Elliott Wave Theorist newsletter has a wide following among investors, had predicted last week that a spell of short-term weakness was in the offing. Yesterday, he said he expected the market to decline further.    Mr. Prechter dismisses the rally from Sept. 22 to Oct. 2 as &quot;the weakest rally of the year, technically speaking.&quot; Even though that rally included a record gain of 75.23 points in the industrial average Sept. 22, he notes there was &quot;not a single day&quot; in which gainers outnumbered losers by two to one or better.    If the industrial average goes down near 2300, it would represent &quot;an ideal buy spot,&quot; Mr. Prechter added. But &quot;at the moment I'm just sitting still.&quot;    Austin George, head of equity trading at T. Rowe Price Associates, minimized the importance of Tuesday's big drop. &quot;The Dow was off 90, but the market didn't have a '90' feel. We have to stop thinking of the Dow as the market,&quot; he said, especially because the stocks in the industrial average are so heavily influenced by computerized arbitrage programs.    Ronald L. Welburn, senior portfolio manager at Glickenhaus andamp; Co., a New York money management firm, says he thinks further declines are in store as the market feels &quot;the weight of 9.75% government bonds.&quot;    Similarly, Leon Cooperman, co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., didn't seem much impressed by the 30-point late-afternoon recovery. &quot;Everything comes up for air,&quot; he said.    While some traders sounded subdued, George Zimmerman, director of research at Gruntal andamp; Co., said he remains &quot;very bullish.&quot; One of his reasons, he says, is that the final phase-in of tax-rate changes will put an estimated $25 billion more in consumers' pockets.    Retailing stocks, Mr. Zimmerman noted, were &quot;under the hammer again.&quot; But he thinks investors are overreacting to a bulge in inventories at some firms. Many companies, he says, built up supplies from the Pacific basin, trying to act before the dollar weakened further. So, he says, those who interpret the inventory bulge as a sign that consumers are tapped out may be wrong.    Limited, which had stabilized in recent days at around 35, slid 3 3/4 to 31 1/4. A front-page story in this newspaper yesterday discussed the possibility of a shakeout among specialty clothing retailers.    Among other retailers, Consolidated Stores dropped 5/8 to 5 3/8, K mart was off 1 to 39, Sears slipped 1/2 to 50, May Department Stores fell 1 to 41 and Gap was down 1 1/2 to 34 3/4.    United Stockyards, whose stock symbol is COW, jumped almost over the moon. It was up 2 1/8 to 14 for an 18% gain, but company officials told the Big Board that they wouldn't comment on market activity or rumors. United had risen 1 3/8 Tuesday and 3/8 Monday. Volume yesterday was 79,900 shares, far above the stock's normal trading volume.    American Hoist andamp; Derrick rose 1 1/8 to 10 3/8. It announced Tuesday that thirdquarter earnings were 54 cents a share, up from 15 cents a share a year earlier.    Valley Industries rose 1/4 to 3 5/8. Earlier this week, the company said it earned $765,000 in the quarter ended Aug. 31, compared with a $7.4 million loss in the like quarter last year.    Trading in the over-the-counter market mostly mirrored the patterns on the major exchanges. The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.87 to 444.64. Declining Nasdaq stocks outnumbered advancing ones by 1,531 to 853. </TEXT></DOC>
