His name is Mikhail Gorbachev.    The Soviet leader's arms-control initiatives have put the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on the defensive. Well-timed political statements have sown confusion and conflicting hopes in West Germany, France and Britain. And he isn't finished: Analysts are bracing for new proposals, ranging from troop pullouts to the release of dissidents to reunifying Germany, that could stun public opinion and increase political pressure on Western governments.    In Europe, speculation about what Mr. Gorbachev might do, and when, has come to dominate the political stage. At last week's economic summit in Venice, Italy, the U.S. desire to discuss the Persian Gulf was swamped by European fascination with Mr. Gorbachev. British officials say the Venice meeting's political discussion consisted almost entirely of an exchange of opinions about what Mr. Gorbachev is up to by leaders who recently met with him, such as Britain's Margaret Thatcher and France's Jacques Chirac.    Their broad conclusion: In the game of strategic gin rummy, he is playing in a new and alarming way -- throwing down just the cards the West has said it wants, but threatening to win anyway.    So far Mr. Gorbachev's approach has been to take the West up on a series of old proposals made when NATO was certain previous Soviet leaders would reject them. &quot;We used to be able to make silly proposals, like the zero option, knowing they'd be rejected,&quot; says a top French official. &quot;We booby-trapped ourselves. Gorbachev pulled the right string, and the whole thing unraveled. Beautiful. Well played.&quot; The zero option refers to a plan under negotiation to remove U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range missiles from Europe.    What Western Europe fears next is a series of well-timed Soviet proposals, perhaps followed by action. A unilateral troop withdrawal from East Germany or Czechoslovakia would grab headlines without affecting Soviet military dominance there. A pullout from Afghanistan, or a settlement involving the former king, would burnish Mr. Gorbachev's peacemaker image.    A proposal for a weapons-free Middle European corridor would appeal to many people in the West. And even a hint that the Berlin Wall could come down -- as President Reagan demanded again last Friday -- would make Mr. Gorbachev a hero in West Germany.    Europeans are convinced that Mr. Gorbachev's aims are the same as those of every Soviet leader since World War II: to decouple Western Europe from the U.S. and thereby dominate the continent.    Previous Soviet leaders tried to cow Europe with military might. But Mr. Gorbachev's subtler game puts political appeal before might. If he can win political concessions, he could divert resources from military to industrial uses at home, as well as attracting, or coercing, high technology and money from the newly docile West, analysts reason.    &quot;He has completely turned around Soviet strategy and tactics, and thus has turned inside-out all of the West's traditional positions,&quot; says Francois Heisbourg, a French strategic planner. &quot;He's playing on Western public opinion, on politics, and so far he has thoroughly outplayed us.&quot;    Mr. Gorbachev entered the game by picking up an old Western discard -- the zero option. The West countered by seeking the elimination of the Soviet advantage in shorter-range missiles. He speedily agreed, totally confounding NATO.    In Reykjavik, Iceland, last week, NATO reluctantly accepted this so-called double-zero option while calling for substantial cuts in Soviet conventional forces. While it isn't yet certain, the Russians have hinted that Mr. Gorbachev will trump this card, too.    &quot;I would be surprised if there wasn't another Gorbachev spectacular fairly soon, this time involving short-range nuclear arms and conventional and chemical weapons,&quot; says Mr. Heisbourg. Indeed, rumors raged last month during a Warsaw Pact meeting in East Berlin that Mr. Gorbachev would propose unilateral troop withdrawals and offer the reunification of the two Germanys in return for a Central European neutral zone -- the two Germanys, Poland and Hungary. Western strategists also fear a Gorbachev trump to the West's 25-year-old demand that the Soviets tear down the Berlin Wall, perhaps as part of the &quot;demilitarized zone.&quot;    &quot;We in the West aren't ready for such a proposal,&quot; says Peter Danylow of Bonn's Institute for Foreign Policy Research.    Says a high-ranking French government official: &quot;We would all have to applaud, of course, but then we'd have absolutely no idea what to do.&quot; He adds: &quot;Do the French really want a reunified, strong Germany? Do the British? Do the Americans? The timing is terrible for us, because it's Gorbachev's timing. But how could we say no?&quot;    In many cases, the trial balloons accomplish as much politically as taking substantive action. &quot;He's put both an Afghanistan settlement and the Berlin Wall back into the game without actually doing anything,&quot; says a British official. &quot;The jokers remain in his hand.&quot;    Adds a top West German policy maker: &quot;He's already got all of us Germans talking about reunification, without actually having done or said anything. Both the left and the right wings here are discussing something that could be very dangerous, at a cost to the Russians of zero.&quot;    Should Mr. Gorbachev actually play these cards, his actions would polish his new-found image as a peacemaker: West German, British and Dutch polls already show that more people see him as a man of peace than do Mr. Reagan.    &quot;His goal is to turn the Soviet Union into a real superpower, not just a superpower in arms alone,&quot; says a British Foreign Office Soviet expert. &quot;What makes him tick is his profound sense of the failure and economic stagnation of his country compared to the West. He's a competitive chap, and he's humiliated that they can't do better.&quot;    This official says Mr. Gorbachev's goal is to gain a detente that &quot;would allow enough stability, security and predictability in foreign relations to allow him to get on with his economic reforms at home, helped by Western credits and technology. He can't do this if the Soviet Union is seen as threatening its neighbors, as it has been for the past 40 years.&quot;    Mr. Gorbachev, of course, hasn't won every trick. Western analysts say his main goal at February's Reykjavik summit was to get rid of the U.S.'s Strategic Defense Initiative, something the Russians fear would give the West an advantage and would be costly to duplicate. SDI, the so-called Star Wars missile defense, hasn't been mentioned much lately by the Soviets, though some analysts expect it to reappear as a bargaining goal in return for hefty cuts in intercontinenal missiles, during the next U.S. administration.    Each Gorbachev initiative could catch the West flat-footed and divided, as the nuclear proposals have done. &quot;Conventional arms reductions could be very sticky for us,&quot; says John Roper, of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London. &quot;If he offers attractive troop reductions just when Congress is trying to save some money on U.S. troops, he could touch off some real Euro-handwringing just by doing what we've asked him to do.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;. . .
