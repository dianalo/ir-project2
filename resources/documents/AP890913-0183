Deputy Social Security Commissioner Louis Enoff told a Housesubcommittee that while the agency agrees that older Americansshould be encouraged to stay in the workforce, relaxing the SocialSecurity earnings limit would be too expensive.   ``We have not been able to come up with a way that would notinvolve significant short-term costs,'' Enoff told a subcommittee ofthe House Select Committee on Aging.   Under current law, workers aged 65 trrough 69 lose $1 in SocialSecurity benefits for every $2 they earn above $8,880. The limit is$6,480 for workers under age 65, and there is no limit for those 70or older.   In 1990, benefits for those aged 65-69 will be reduced $1 forevery $3 earned above the limit.   Almost 1 million Social Security beneficiaries lose some or allof their benefits each year because of the test in effect for thoseaged 65-69, and an additional 100,000 people in that age group donot file for Social Security benefits because the test is in effect,according to Social Security.   Reps. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, and William Hughes, D-N.J., haveintroduced legislation to exempt the earnings of child care workersaged 65 or older from the Social Security earnings limits, sayingthe proposal would encourage older Americans to work longer and helpmeet the nation's day care needs.   The Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would cost $85million over five years.   ``Why shouldn't we attempt to match needs such as child care tothe desire to get older Americans who have so much to offer backinto the workforce?'' asked Hughes, acting chairman of thesubcommittee.   ``I don't have any disagreement with trying to match them,''Enoff responded. ``My only concern would be a massive elimination ofsomething like the earnings test or to try to administer a way ofpicking and choosing'' which earnings would be exempt.   Hughes said the earnings exemption could be extended to otherareas in which there are shortages, such as skilled nursing, withthe nation eventually repealing the earnings limit altogether.   ``We need to be doing a far better job than we've done to date intrying to find out how we can get older Americans back into themainstream of American life,'' he said.   Carolyn Golding, deputy assistant labor secretary, took noposition on the legislation, but told the subcommittee thatpremature retirement ``becomes a real cost to the individual worker,the employer and the nation.''   ``There is much to be gained by using older workers to meet theneeds for day care,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
