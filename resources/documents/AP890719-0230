And they certainly did getpeople's attention.   But when Congress completes work on a national service bill,there is virtually no chance it will include the radical proposaladvanced by Sen. Sam Nunn and Rep. Dave McCurdy to require militaryor community service in return for student financial aid.   Where the two Democrats envisioned a lofty new definition ofcitizenship, critics foresaw ``indentured servitude'' for low-incomestudents.   Few question the value of public service; senators, in fact, havejumped onto the bandwagon with a host of alternatives that haveturned out to be more appealing to members than the Nunn-McCurdybill itself.   Objections to the Nunn-McCurdy plan have ranged from PresidentBush's stand against any incentives for voluntarism to Pentagonmurmurings that the proposal could undermine the volunteer army.Perhaps the most widespread concern was expressed by EducationSecretary Lauro Cavazos when he said the plan raises questions aboutequity.   Liberal Rep. William Ford, D-Mich., writing of the bill in TheChronicle of Higher Education, laid it on the line bluntly: ``Itholds the educational aspirations of the poor hostage to publicservice, while excusing the affluent.''   And conservative Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called it``incredibly unfair to penalize somebody because of an accident ofbirth. Frankly, I don't know what they were thinking of.''   Nunn, D-Ga., introducing his bill last January, said it was timeto ``awaken a new spirit of citizenship and obligation in America.''McCurdy, D-Okla., said the idea was to ``appeal to the broad valuesof citizenship rather than the narrow views of self-interest.''   So they proposed that young people spend one to two years ineducation, social, conservation or military service; public safetywork; VISTA or the Peace Corps. In return participants would receive$10,000 to $12,000 a year to be used for college, job training or adown payment on a home. Service would be required to qualify forstudent aid.   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee is planning tocomplete work on a $200 million to $400 million national servicebill before Congress breaks Aug. 4 for its summer recess.   Aides say it will have many components, including one linkingpublic service to student aid that stems in part from theNunn-McCurdy proposal. However, it will not make student financialaid contingent on service or in any way dismantle the existingsystem of grants and loans.   The section is expected to combine elements of Nunn-McCurdy witha part-time, National Guard-type service program proposed by Sens.Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., and Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.   The option of a part-time commitment would mean participantswould not have to postpone college. In addition, the program wouldbe purely voluntary since low-income students could get financialaid without participating.   In the House, the Education and Labor Committee is expected todraft a national service bill this fall, against a backdrop of heavylobbying by labor unions concerned about volunteers usurping theirturf and education groups opposed to linking service to student aid.A high-ranking committee aide said members have universally rejectedthe Nunn-McCurdy approach and may spurn any plan, even a purelyvoluntary one, that links the two.   Nunn and McCurdy profess to be satisfied at this point with theimpact of their proposal on the Senate. ``Our whole purpose was tochallenge and to be somewhat provocative in our approach,'' McCurdysaid in an interview. ``Plus ours was the only one that dealt withthe military.''   Nunn's spokesman, Scott Williams, said Nunn never expected to winacceptance of his sweeping vision on the first try. ``This is onlythe beginning of what we see as a long haul,'' he said.   It could be argued that Bush actually started the nationalservice debate with his ``thousand points of light'' campaign themeand a campaign promise of a $100 million volunteer program.   Last month, with that in mind, Bush announced a Youth Engaged inService Foundation, which would receive $25 million a year infederal money to spur Americans to volunteer for social service.However, he has not sent any legislation to Capitol Hill _frustrating the efforts of committee members in both chambers whowould like to see the president's initiative included in the majornational service bill.   ``As soon as we get something in writing, we'll try to work itin,'' said a Senate aide who spoke on condition of anonymity.   But while lawmakers are generally receptive to Bush's ideas, thefeeling is not mutual. ``Service is its own reward,'' Bush told agroup of 3,000 students last month. He has said he does not supportprograms that offer stipends or payment subsidies, or use studentaid funds to pay for volunteer service.   Several components of the expected Senate bill could lead to aconfrontation with the White House _ among them the Pell-Mikulskisection, expansions of VISTA and volunteer programs under the OlderAmericans Act, and a full-time youth service corps that would payparticipants or give them education benefits.   Based on bills introduced by Sens. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., andDaniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., the corps would be open to highschool graduates and dropouts aged 16-25. Participants would work onpublic lands or at government agencies, hospitals, schools, nursinghomes, law-enforcement agencies or non-profit service organizations.   Bush is reported to favor one element of the projected Senatebill, a student community service plan sponsored by committeechairman Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. The program would involveelementary, secondary and college students and out-of-school youthin tutoring, assisting the elderly, anti-drug abuse efforts, work inday-care centers, homeless shelters and food banks.
