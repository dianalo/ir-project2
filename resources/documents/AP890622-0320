The dollar managed to recover some lost ground after the WhiteHouse denial. Currency dealers said the rumor circulated in foreignexchange markets for 45 minutes to an hour.   But a lack of buying interest in the dollar plus dollar sales bycentral banks to prop up the sagging British pound contributed to agenerally weak day for the dollar, dealers said.   William Mikus, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc., saidthe Bush rumor ``probably pushed the dollar through 140 yen,triggering a lot of stop-loss sales,'' which were aimed at limitinglosses by unloading dollars in case the currency declined further.   Bob Morrissey, a senior trader at the Bank of Boston's New Yorkoffice, said trading was thin and choppy with the market on guardfor possible central bank intervention.   A report by a Washington-based consulting group that Japan, theUnited States and West Germany were determined to bring the dollarlower by selling the American currency has been denied by centralbanks but has left traders extra wary, Morrissey said.   The British pound was hammered during the day by reports of morerailway strikes following Wednesday's 24-hour shutdown of thenational rail network over a pay claim.   The pound recovered a bit in European trading when the Bank ofEngland, Britain's central bank, intervened in the market by buyingpounds to hold up the exchange rate. Late Thursday in London, oneBritish pound cost $1.5525, more expensive for buyers than lateWednesday's $1.54675.   Sterling was weighed down by renewed selling later in New York.The Federal Reserve, possibly acting on behalf of the Bank ofEngland, was believed to have sold dollars and bought pounds,currency dealers said.
