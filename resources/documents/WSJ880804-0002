The department wants to build one plant at its current Savannah River nuclear generating facilities near Aiken, S.C., and another smaller plant at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in Idaho Falls, Idaho. Both would produce tritium, which is used in small amounts to increase the explosive power of nuclear weapons, and would take at least 10 years to build.    The department needs the new reactors to supplant the troubled array of current reactors, most of which are more than 30 years old, the secretary said. Its Hanford Nuclear Site at Richland, Wash., is shut down to fix problems identified after the 1986 accident at the Soviet Union's Chernobyl nuclear plant. Three reactors at Savannah River have been operating at half power for more than a year, and a fourth was shut down after questions were raised about its capacity to handle certain accidents.    &quot;We've gone from five reactors to the equivalent of one and one-half in a matter of three years,&quot; said Troy Wade, a department official in charge of defense programs. &quot;It's not a good situation.&quot;    The plant in South Carolina would use heavy water technology, a traditional production method, and would have the capacity to meet U.S. tritium needs by itself, Mr. Herrington said. The plant in Idaho would use a newer technology, a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor, and eventually would be able to generate half the country's tritium requirements, if it were expanded after testing.    Although the plants aren't expected to face big opposition from lawmakers, some legislators said Congress may not provide the extra funding to expand the Idaho facility. Georgia Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn, a proponent of the facility in neighboring South Carolina, called the Idaho plant a &quot;back-up system.&quot; Idaho Republican Sen. James McClure, however, said he was confident the facility would be expanded to full capacity.    Mr. Harrington said the department also considered putting a new plant at the Hanford facility. But he said political and community opposition in Washington and neighboring Oregon is a &quot;major concern.&quot;    Tritium, plutonium and uranium are the key substances produced by nuclear plants for weapons. The U.S. has stockpiles of the three elements, but tritium decays far more rapidly than the other two.    Mr. Herrington noted that awarding of contracts to build the new plants is at least several months off. </TEXT></DOC>
