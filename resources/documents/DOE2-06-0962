<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-06-0962 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic Gassum Formation is a shallow marineor deltaic sandstone body with intercalated mudstones. The sandstonesare primarily arkoses and subarkoses, but the composition is stronglyinfluenced by diagenesis. Depths of burial vary between ca. 550 m and3350 m, and the diagenetic modifications are strongly dependcant on depth.The diagenetic pattern is also related to primary lithology. At shallowdepth of burial, the most important diagenetic changes are compaction,calcite cementation, formation of kaolinite, and dissolution of feldspar.In deeply buried parts of the formation, the most important diageneticchanges are reduction of primary and secondary porosity by strong cementationby quartz, albitization of partly dissolved feldspar and ankerite cementation.In chlorite-cemented parts, quartz cementation was inhibited, and herepressure solution occurred in deep parts of the formation. The porosityin these deeply buried samples may be reduced to secondary intragranularporosity in partly dissolved feldspar and intercrystalline prosity inclay mineral cements. Other diagenetic minerals are siderite, pyrite,and hydrite, potassium feldspar and illite. The diagenesis evolved throughthe eodiagenesis and the immature and semimature stages of mesodiagenesis,whereas mature stages have not been reached. 50 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
