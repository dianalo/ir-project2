The House and Senate banking committees, after six weeks ofhearings, begin writing their own versions of Sandamp;L legislation thisweek.   Democrats on the House panel are meeting privately Tuesday inpreparation for public drafting sessions beginning two days later.Senators are also gathering behind closed doors this week, beforestarting open meetings April 13.   ``I expect to see (the Bush proposal) adopted without majorsurgery ... (and) on the president's desk by May,'' said consultantWilliam Issac, a former chairman of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp.   Quick movement is nearly unprecedented for a major piece oflegislation dealing with the financial system and the host ofspecial interest groups representing its segments, but this timefear is a driving force.   Sandamp;L depositors are withdrawing their funds in record amounts _$35 billion from November through February _ and members ofCongress are afraid to risk further deterioration.   Sandamp;L regulators at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board say the hugewithdrawals are not abnormal when interest rates rise and mutualfunds and other competitors offer investors a better return.   However, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and the WhiteHouse budget director, Richard Darman, are telling Congress thatdepositors are nervous because the president's plan isn't in place.   Brady used several speeches last week _ in Dallas, New York andWashington _ to press the administration claim that ``we willcontinue to see withdrawals as long as our plan is not enacted intolaw.''   Some in Congress, even those with reservations about the plan,are inclined to give Bush what he wants and try to sidesteppolitical blame if things go wrong. If the plan works, then it wasCongress that passed it. If it doesn't, then it's the Bush plan.   But other members of Congress are looking to put their mark onthe bill. Administration officials fear the most likely target willbe Bush's complex scheme to keep $50 billion in bailout money outof the budget deficit by creating a new government corporation tosell bonds.   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., Senate Banking Committeechairman, and Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., say they can save morethan $4 billion in interest costs by borrowing the $50 billionthrough regular Treasury bonds. They would carry a lower interestrate than the special off-budget bonds, which also would be backedby the Treasury, but in a less direct fashion.   The Riegle-Schumer plan would balloon the budget deficit for thecurrent fiscal year ending Sept. 30, but it would avoid theautomatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law because all ofthe 1989 deficit target deadlines have expired.   Administration officials view this as a thinly disguisedDemocratic attempt to bust Gramm-Rudman, creating a precedent forbig spending increases for other programs and ruining Bush'schances of keeping his no-new-taxes pledge. They argue that theirown, off-budget, evasion of Gramm-Rudman is harder to duplicate.   Another dispute, this one an intra-Republican squabble betweenthe administration and Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the senior GOPmember of the banking panel, had loomed as a potential roadblock.   Garn, whose former top aide, M. Danny Wall, is chairman of theFederal Home Loan Bank Board, has enjoyed great influence at thebank board, an independent agency.   The administration wants to transfer the bank board's depositinsurance fund to the FDIC, which already insures accounts atcommercial banks, and wrap the remainder of the agency into theTreasury Department.   Garn is adamantly opposed to allowing what he calls ``the gnomesof Treasury,'' perceived to be more sympathetic to the interests ofbig banks and Wall Street than to Sandamp;Ls, to get their clutches onthe Sandamp;L agency.   Bush advisers aren't budging. They say that if taxpayers areasked to bail out the industry, then an executive branchdepartment, directly responsible to elected officials, must controlthe regulators.   A potential compromise would put the regulatory functions of thebank board into the Treasury Department, but leave its financingaspects independent. The board's 12 regional banks borrow money onWall Street at low interest rates, funneling it to small andmedium-sized Sandamp;Ls that don't have the clout to get the low rates ontheir own.   Congressional aides predict Garn will take the deal because hedoesn't want to hold up the legislation and he faces severalnot-so-subtle threats if he doesn't go along.   The administration, if it was inclined, could go along with apush by Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the HouseBanking Committee, to force Wall to undergo reconfirmation by theSenate.   The other big battle will be over the administration's proposalto force Sandamp;Ls to meet tougher capital standards, 6 percent insteadof 3 percent, by June 1991.   Capital represents the money an Sandamp;L's owners have invested.Owners required to risk more of their own money before federaldeposit insurance kicks in are likely to manage more carefully.</TEXT></DOC>
