During the phase transition a large portion of theinitial kinetic energy is invested in the latent heat. At late expansionstages we gain back this energy as random thermal motion and not as directedcollective flow. In the framework of a three-dimensional relativisticfluid dynamical model the sensitivity of dN{sub B}/dy, and {l_angle}p{supz}/a {r_angle} on the equation of state are pointed out. 13 refs., 3figs.</TEXT></DOC>
