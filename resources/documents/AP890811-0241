At the same time, the Commerce Department said that retail salesjumped 0.9 percent last month and that consumer spending in May andJune had not been as sluggish as previously thought.   Analysts said the double dose of good economic news showed thatinflationary pressures were easing and that the economy was in nodanger of tumbling into a recession.   Still, the financial markets reacted skittishly: In earlytrading, bond prices soared and the Dow Jones average of 30industrial stocks rose above its 1987 all-time high. But thensentiment turned bearish.   By the end of the day, bonds fell and the Dow Jones industrialaverage was off 28.64 points at 2,683.99, well shy of recordterritory.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the day's reportsshowed the country was on ``a sound economic course.''   ``Unemployment is the lowest in more than a decade; inflation isgoing down; growth is steady,'' Fitzwater said.   Private economists, who have spent much of the year alternatelyworrying about a possible inflationary spiral or an imminentrecession, said Friday's reports showed that both fears wereoverblown.   ``Alan Greenspan (chairman of the Federal Reserve) has pulledoff what most of his critics said couldn't be done,'' said MichaelK. Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm. ``You aren't goingto find any reasonable economist now who will tell you that we areheading into a recession.''   The Federal Reserve has been trying to engineer a so-calledsoft-landing for the economy in which economic growth slows enoughto dampen inflationary pressures without dumping the country into adownturn.   Many analysts said the July increase in retail sales, thestrongest advance since April, coupled with upward revisions in theprevious two months showed renewed confidence in the importantconsumer sector. Last week, the government said healthy job growthhad pushed the civilian unemployment rate down to 5.2 percent inJuly.   ``We have the best of both worlds, no inflation and increasingconsumer spending,'' said Dirk Van Dongen, president of theNational Association of Wholesaler-Distributors.   The 0.4 percent July fall in wholesale prices was the biggestone-month drop since July 1986, when prices eased 0.8 percent. Lastmonth's decline followed a 0.1 percent decline in June and amountedto the first back-to-back declines since four consecutive downturnsfrom January through April of 1986.   The news on inflation was particularly welcome because it cameafter a surge in prices earlier in the year had triggered fearsthat the country could be on the verge of another inflationaryspiral.   Before the consecutive declines, wholesale costs this year wereracing ahead at an annual rate topping 9 percent. With thedeclines, the annual inflation rate is now a more moderate 5.7percent.   Many economists predicted a further easing of price pressures inthe months ahead and said this would give the Federal Reserve moreroom to lower interest rates.   Since early June, the central bank has made three small moves topush interest rates lower after a year-long effort to drive themhigher as part of its anti-inflation campaign.   The two biggest factors pushing prices down in July were a 7.2percent plunge in gasoline costs and a 1.9 percent drop in new carprices.   Labor Department analysts credited the drop in car prices tounusually early end-of-the-model-year price cutting by automakerstrying to clear out large inventories of unsold cars before 1990models appear. That development boosted car sales in the retailsales report as well.   The gasoline price decline, the biggest monthly drop since July1986, helped to mask an increase of 1.5 percent in the cost ofnatural gas and a 0.3 percent rise in home heating oil costs.   Food costs, which had plunged 0.8 percent in June, edged up by0.1 percent in July, reflecting higher beef prices, which rose 2.5percent, and a 1.3 percent rise for fresh fruit prices.   Prices also turned upward for fish, pasta, soft drinks, coffeeand rice.   Partially offsetting the gains was another big drop in vegetableprices, down 9 percent after an 8 percent June decline.   Prices excluding the volatile food and energy categories fell0.2 percent, a good sign that the underlying rate of inflation ismoderating, economists said.   The improvement in July left the Producer Price Index forfinished goods at 114.0, meaning that a hypothetical selection ofgoods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $114.00 last month.</TEXT></DOC>
