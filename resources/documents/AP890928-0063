The protesters arrested Wednesday at the Greyhound-Trailwaysstation were released on their own recognizance, and buses that hadbeen stopped for several hours began rolling again.   About 200 demonstrators surrounded one intercity bus, forcing itto unload passengers on a busy downtown street. More than 18 otherbuses were forced to unload passengers on side streets because ofthe protest.   The protesters parked their wheelchairs in front of the busesand sat inside their luggage compartments. One demonstrator chainedhimself by the neck to the steering wheel of a bus.   Locking their wheelchairs together, they chanted, ``Access is acivil right.''   ``I am trying to hold up Greyhound because they are holding upmy life,'' said Clayton Jones, 41, of Houston, who lost the use ofhis legs in a 1985 accident.   Tom Street, regional manager of Greyhound-Trailways, askedpolice to arrest the protesters.   Police loaded the demonstrators into unmarked buses with lifts.Charges included disorderly conduct, trespassing and failing toclear streets and sidewalks.   Protest leader Michael Auberger said his group, AmericanDisabled for Accessible Public Transportation, targeted the busline because Greyhound-Trailways has refused to add wheelchairlifts because of the cost.   He also said the group was demonstrating against aGreyhound-Trailways policy requiring passengers in wheelchairs tobring someone with them to carry them on and off.   Street said he told the protesters that with 24 hours' notice,Greyhound will help load disabled passengers. He also said majorstations will have mechanical lifts within two years.   Wednesday marked the third day of protests in Atlanta by ADAPT.Its members occupied a federal building on Monday and Tuesday in anattempt to force the government to order wheelchair lifts installedon public buses.   That protest ended when Bush administration officials promisedto urge Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner to meet with theprotesters.</TEXT></DOC>
