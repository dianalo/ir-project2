NAB President William Kolberg said the Corporate Action Agendais the first set of reports and action plans to be released sincePresident Bush met with the nation's governors last week inCharlottesville, Va.   The goal is to provide immediate and direct answers to businesspeople on how they must become involved now to initiate fundamentaleducational change.   Kolberg added that key members of the alliance ``will beinvolved very much'' in helping to set the national performancegoals recommended by Bush and the governors at the summit.   Alliance statistics showed that in 1950, only 57.4 percent ofAmerican students graduated from high school, but those who failedto graduate could still find jobs and lead productive lives. Today,some 75 percent of the students graduate, but many are in noposition to absorb education and training beyond the high schoollevel.   By 1995, it is estimated that some 14 million Americans will beunprepared for the jobs available, the Alliance said.   The Corporate Action Agenda _ endorsed by Education SecretaryLauro Cavazos _ is comprised of four publications and a videotape.   One of the publications, ``A Blueprint for Business onRestructuring Education,'' outlines five major ways of using theexperience of business in restructuring America's schools:school-based management, professionalism of teachers andadministrators, curriculum and instruction, accountability andlinking schools with social services.   The action plans also provide in-depth information on new jointventures and partnerships between businesses and school system, anddetails on establishing community-wide collaborative school-to-worktransition programs.   ``It is clear the business community has a major role to play inhelping right the ship of education,'' said Kolberg, pointing tothe numerous years businesses have been involved in helping schoolswith ``much of this effort focused on tinkering at the margin.''   Kolberg said there are 140,800 education partnershipsnationwide, 57 percent sponsored by businesses or businessorganizations. Yet few of the partnerships have effectedfundamental educational change, he said.   ``Business must do more for our education system than simplypaying for our athletic uniforms, speaking in a classroom,tutoring, offering plant tours or showing up for career days,''said Kolberg.   ``We are ready to work with others to make systemic changes inthe education system, both at the national, state and locallevels,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
