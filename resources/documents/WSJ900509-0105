The choice of Stone Container wasn't expected by manyindustry observers, including Roger Stone, chairman,president and chief executive officer of the Chicago paperproducts concern.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We have somewhat of a reputation as a hard bargainer. I'msurprised,&quot; Mr. Stone said.   The union represents about 30,000 workers at mills inEastern Canada, which is a producer of newsprint, pulp, andother paper products. As a rule, the union negotiates acontract with one company or group of mills and thatsettlement is then adopted by the rest of the industry.   Analysts said the union may have picked Stone Containerbecause the union believes the company isn't prepared toendure a strike. &quot;If that's true they've misjudged thesituation,&quot; Mr. Stone said.   Don Holder, union president, said that &quot;we believe we canget a settlement without a strike.&quot; The union is seeking an8% wage increase in each year of a two-year contract and anautomatic cost-of-living increase. But Mr. Holder concededthat &quot;it would be a little naive to expect to come out with8%.&quot; The base wage rate at the Stone Container mills iscurrently 15.37 Canadian dollars (US$13.22) an hour.Contracts at most Eastern Canadian mills expired April 30.   The contract negotiations will be watched closely bynewsprint buyers. Most major newsprint producers haveannounced a June 1 price increase of US$35 a metric ton toUS$685 a ton on the East Coast, and a similar increase in theWest, where the price scale is slightly different.Transaction prices, the actual prices paid by buyers, aremuch lower with 20% discounts widespread. Industry executivessaid they expect that an increase in the list price wouldlift transaction prices from about US$520 a ton to aboutUS$550.   Initially, many publishers didn't expect the priceincrease to go through, but now opinion is mixed. An extendedstrike at the three Stone mills, one of which producesstandard newsprint, could help producers push through theprice increase. The newsprint market is highly sensitive tominor shifts in supply and demand.   &quot;A strike is probably the only chance&quot; for a price boost,said J. William Cox, senior vice president at the DallasMorning News.   The increase is &quot;a contrived non-market driven farce,&quot;said Homer Taylor, vice president of supply at Knight-RidderInc. in Miami. While a strike could temporarily liftnewsprint prices, once production returned to normal, priceswould fall back to current levels, Mr. Taylor said.</TEXT></DOC>
