Whilechanges are expected in how producers, pipelines, and distributors functionas the industry adapts to more deregulated field markets, the precisenature of these changes is not yet clear and is not likely to be clearfor some time. Good data about the natural gas industry is a necessaryprelude to understanding how the industry functions and how deregulatedfield markets will affect consumers. In 1980 the Professional Audit ReviewTeam criticized EIA for not initiating comprehensive data user surveysto determine the kinds of data that should be collected and disseminated.This critique, together with EIA management's commitment to improvementof its data planning activities, led EIA to request that the NationalResearch Council form a panel to study user needs for natural gas dataand to provide guidelines about cost effective means for determiningwhether or not user needs are being met. This document is the panel'sreport.</TEXT></DOC>
