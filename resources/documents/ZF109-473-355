(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>DCA 10NET Communications recently released its entry into the 10BaseT arena.andO;The 10BASE Twisted-Pair Adapter is an 8-bit ISA card selling for $425.andP;  DCAalso plans to have an MCA card in release by the time you read this.andP;  Itsprojected price will be $475.andP;  The company has had these 10BaseT productsunder development since early this year, less time than many of itscompetitors.andP;  Prior to entering the 10BaseT field, it established a presencein the Ethernet market dating back to 1988.andM;DCA's adapter, like Hewlett-Packard's, uses only a smaller RJ-11 connector onthe adapter card instead of the more flexible RJ-45 and AUI connectors, whichmay limit the expandability of your network.andP;  As a standard feature, the carduses gate-array technology with a built-in transceiver that provides theconnection to the twisted-pair medium.andP;  Two LEDs appear on the rear of thecard: a green light to indicate link status and a red light to monitortransmit functions.andP;  The full-length card is versatile enough to fit intoeither an 8- or 16-bit slot.andM;INSTALLATIONandM;We saw the manual only in its draft stage, but it already had an index andtable of contents, a trouble-shooting guide, and was written in a languagethat would be understandable to nonprogrammers.andP;  It's laid out in such a waythat even a novice in the field of 10BaseT will understand the system afterreading it.andP;  It walks you through installation with diagrams andeasy-to-understand language.andP;  It also includes simple instructions on how toinstall the card, along with the transceiver and hub units.andM;A menu-driven program helps you install the 10NET driver software, listingthe current IRQ setting, the port address, and the size of the shared memorywindow as you go along.andP;  The installation program and driver software come inboth 5.25- and 3.5-inch formats.andM;The DCA 10NET card contains 32K of dual-port RAM and conforms to the IEEE10BaseT standard of a maximum wire length of 100 meters, or 330 feet.andP;  Italso supports such standard systems as 10NET Plus, LAN Manager, NDIS, NetWare286, and NetBIOS networking software drivers.andP;  Currently it does not supportNetWare 386.andP;  There is no boot PROM available at this time, thus eliminatingthe use of a diskless workstation.andM;Nevertheless, 10NET does provide numerous devices for network expansion.andP;  Forexample, it offers a $2,200 10BASE Twisted-Pair Concentrator, which offersexpansion through 11 twisted-pair connections, one fiber-optic connector, andone AUI port.andP;  One of the twisted-pair ports is dedicated to daisy-chainingconnections between hubs to make them part of the same network, while theother ten ports allow PC connections.andP;  In addition to its connector ports, italso features LEDs indicating both jabber and receive, plus LEDs showingtransmit and receive status.andP;  While the price of this hub may seem a littlehigher than usual, its fiber-optic capability gives it the advantage ofconnecting to other hubs over a distance of several kilometers.andM;DCA 10NET also markets a 3-by 4-by 1.25-inch 10BASE twisted-pair transceiver.andO;The transceiver includes such features as a power-on and transmit indicator,a link status and receive indicator, and LEDs that display collision andjabber conditions on the network.andP;  The unit also has a signal quality error(SQE) switch that verifies the link between the AUI port on the hub and thetransceiver.andP;  The connector sells for $195 and transfers data as rapidly as10 megabits per second.andM;Another of the company's 10BaseT products is a 10-megabit fiber-optic cardcalled the 10NET 10-Meg Fiber Optic, which costs $795.andP;  DCA 10NET continuesto sell the standard Ethernet adapter cards and hubs.andP;  It also offers twotypes of bridges: the 10NET Plus LAN Bridge lets you connect a 10BASEtwisted-pair LAN to a variety of different networks, including another10BaseT LAN, a 10NET Bus/ StarLAN with 1-megabit twisted-pair cabling, a 1-or 10-megabit fiber-optic LAN, or a 10NET LAN with standard Ethernet coaxialcable.andP;  The bridge sells for $595.andP;  The second bridge is a NetBIOS-onlybridge that sells for $295.andP;  It allows you to connect a 10NET network to aNetBIOS-compatible third-party network like the IBM Token-Ring or Microsoft'sLAN Manager.andM;WARRANTY AND OTHER PRODUCTSandM;DCA 10NET warrants its cards for one year against defects in materials andworkmanship.andP;  It also provides free unlimited technical support at atoll-free number.andP;  Tech support comes both from the home office in Dayton,Ohio, and through a worldwide dealer network.andM;Perhaps the strongest appeal of the 10BaseT products from DCA 10NET is thatthey are part of a family of products.andP;  The company markets its own operatingsystem, adapters conforming to the federal government's TEMPEST standards foremission security, and other LAN applications such as electronic mail.andM;DCA 10NET can be an economical place for one-stop LAN shopping.andP;  Its pricingis competitive with other 10BaseT manufacturers.andP;  When combined with its10NET PLUS operating system (single-user version, $179; 100-user version,$5,000), DCA 10NET starts to look like the first full-featured 10BaseTcompany.andP;  Even though it is departing from other manufacturers that use RJ-45and AUI connections on their cards, it does offer other features like thee-mail, operating system, and LAN bridges at a more competitive price thanother products we reviewed.andP;  This helps offset the limited direction thecompany originally took in the production of its card.andM;FACT FILEandM;10BASE Twisted-Pair Adapter DCA 10NET Communications, 7887 Washington VillageDr., #200, Dayton, OH 45459;
