SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bolts of lightning strike far more often thanweather records indicate, making electrical storms more dangerousthan previously believed, a weather researcher warns.   The reason is that most records on lightning occurrences arecompiled by observers who listen for thunder, which is produced bylightning.   But new research shows that between 22 percent and 40 percent oflightning flashes occur when no thunder was heard.   ``It is not good news,'' researcher Stanley A. Changnon said ofhis findings, reported in the August edition of the Journal ofGeophysical Research-Atmospheres.   ``Those who have to worry about the risk of lightning damage,for example nuclear power plants, have had to use data based on(thunder records) to develop their risk analyses,'' Changnon saidin a telephone interview.   ``It's very clear that thunder rather dramaticallyunderestimates the frequency of lightning near a given point,'' hesaid.   Changnon, a weather researcher affiliated with the IllinoisState Water Survey who also teaches at the University of Rochesterin Rochester, N.Y., used electromagnetic detectors to record actualcloud-to-ground flashes of lightning.   His report was done in conjunction with his son, David Changnonof Colorado State University, and Richard B. Pyle of the StateUniversity of New York at Albany.   Detailed thunderstorm records go back to the late 1800s,Changnon said, but they have always depended on the reports oftrained observers, who primarily listen for thunder.   In recent years, however, electromagnetic detectors have beeninstalled in many areas to record actual lightning strokes.   The researchers compared the thunder reports of weatherobservers with the lightning records from sensors used by thefederal Bureau of Land Management in Western states and byelectrical utilities along the Eastern seaboard.   ``The degree of relationship is relatively weak,'' Changnonreported. ``It gives one a lot of pause, in many respects, abouthow the atmosphere works, how good our weather records are and howsafe we are.''   In the West, Changnon reported, between 31 percent and 40percent of all lightning strokes were missed by observers listeningfor thunder.   The situation was better in the East, with 22 percent to 26percent of lightning strokes being missed, the report said.   The differences between observations in the East and the Westoccurs, at least in part, because of greater problems in hearingthunder in the West, particularly in mountainous areas, he said.   Lightning killed 86 Americans last year, the highest death tollin this decade but lower than the annual average of 96, accordingto records kept by the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration.   The agency counted 365 lightning-related injuries in 1987, about50 percent higher than the annual average, due largely to a seriesof strikes that hit groups of people.   ``Lightning apparently does not command the respect it deservesas a dangerous killer,'' E. W. Friday, director of the NationalWeather Service, has warned. Friday said only floods compete withlightning in deadliness.   Last year's death toll was the most since 88 people died inlightning strikes in 1978. But that falls far short of severaldeadly years in the 1960s, including 1963 when 210 people werekilled by lightning.   As usual, Florida led the nation with 11 lightning deaths lastyear. Tennessee ranked second with 6, followed by 5 in New Mexicoand 4 each in Alabama, Arkansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Yorkand North Carolina.   Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey,Oklahoma and South Carolina each recorded three fatalities. Therewere two each in Arizona, Kentucky, Missouri, Utah and Virginia.States recording a single lightning death for the year wereWashington, D.C., Kansas, Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania andSouth Dakota.</TEXT></DOC>
