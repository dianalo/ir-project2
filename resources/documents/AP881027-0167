All suggested that foreign debts be renegotiated. Brazil aloneowes $121 billion.   Speaking forcefully and at times with bitterness and anger, thepresidents said in separate speeches that their calls were promptedby economic stagnation at home and rising public discontent.   They said they believe the developed countries, particularly theUnited States, either contribute to their problems or can help insome way they have not so far attempted.   President Alan Garcia of Peru got a standing ovation when hesaid: ``The American people should know that a Latin America that isdisunited is not a good neighbor, that a Latin America that isimpoverished is not a good market.''   Garcia spoke before an inaugural ceremony audience of about 500diplomats and guests at the second meeting of the so-called Group ofEight _ now only seven minus Panama.   Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid declared: ``Budgetadjustments, austerity programs and economic stagnation have madethe 1980s the lost decade (for many Latin American countries).''   The Group of Eight was formed in 1986 to develop common positionson regional problems.   Panama was suspended after Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the realpower behind Panama's elected civilian government, ousted electedPresident Eric Arturo Delvalle last February.   Brazil and Argentina currently are suffering severe bouts ofinflation. Mexico and Venezuela have been hurt economically byfalling world prices for oil. Colombia is engaged in a full-fledgedbattle against cocaine and marijuana traffickers. Peru is battling aguerrilla insurgency. Uruguay, with 3 million inhabitants, has a $6billion foreign, one of the highest per capita debts in LatinAmerica.   The United States and other industrial nations could help, thepresidents said, by renegotiating foreign debts to put a priority oneconomic growth in borrowing countries; by cracking down on users ofillegal drugs; by reducing protectionist legislation that limitsimports, and by helping promote a peaceful solution to conflict inCentral America.   ``It is necessary to put mechanisms in place in our region toreduce (interest) payments as well as procedures to prevent theirre-escalation,'' said President Jose Sarney of Brazil, those countryis the developing world's most indebted nation.   President Virgilio Barco of Colombia said:   ``Since January, 4,559 people involved in this crime (drugtrafficking) have been arrested, 17,326 kilos of cocaine have beenseized ... and 497,000 kilos of marijuana. We also have seizedhundreds of weapons, thousands of kilos of ammunition, hundreds ofvehicles, boats and planes...   ``Meanwhile ... in the capitals of developed nations, drugscirculate with startling ease. The civil liberties of consumerscannot be considered more important than the stability of democracyin nations and the right to life of our judges, reporters, politicalleaders, union members, peasants and office holders.''   A kilogram equals 2.2 pounds.   The seven presidents, seated at a long table on the stage of amunicipal auditorium in this Atlantic resort town, all made shortopening speeches. They then headed to the countryside for atraditional Uruguayan ``asado,'' or barbecue, before going intotheir first round of closed-door meetings.   A joint communique was to be issued on Saturday.   The presidents gave little indication what specific proposalsmight emerge in the communique. No president in his speech calledfor drastic, one-sided action such as withholding debt interestpayments or linking repayments to a fixed figure, such as apercentage of export earnings.   Foreign ministers of the member countries endorsed in April 1987a proposal by President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica that called fordisarming warring factions in Nicaragua and El Salvador and a policyof non-intervention by the United States and the Soviet Union.   Argentine President Raul Alfonsin said he was encouraged by thegroup's progress during the past two years. ``We are a new andnecessary political personality on the world stage,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
