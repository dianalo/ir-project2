XT microcomputer.andP;  Kirschnersaid he created the fields on the database and handed the initial loadingtask to a WAPA employee, which took about 60 hours.andP;  Twice-yearly updates bythe employee take only a few hours.andM;&quot;I'm not sure how many people are using [CHDB], but I've done my best to tryto let [other agencies] know it's out there,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It's kind of limitedin terms of who would want to use it and is primarily people like me, ourlegal people or people in the Washington liaison office.&quot;andM;CHDB contains more than 2,150 records, is backed up daily on three floppydisks and runs on MS-DOS or Apple microcomputers.andM;The program contains 10 fields, including document title; type of activity,such as power marketing or construction and engineering; source; page; fiscalyear; congressional body; subcommittee; member; witness; and hearing date.andM;Once key information from the database is identified, source documents can bereferenced using titles and page numbers in WAPA's three libraries, two ofwhich are located in headquarters, the other in the Washington office.andM;&quot;Right now we don't have full-text search and retrieval, primarily because ofthe cost of having documents scanned into the database,&quot; Kirschner said.andP;  &quot;Ithink the logical next step for CHDB is going to be CD-ROM.andP;  We've got a fewquestions, and we don't have the in-house capability to scan information forCD-ROM.andM;WAPA maintains federal electric power marketing and transmission functions in15 central and western states, covering 1.3 million square miles.andM;The agency operates and maintains more than 16,000 miles of transmissionlines, 228 substations and several auxiliary power facilities.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
