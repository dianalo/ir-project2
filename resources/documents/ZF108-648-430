(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>You are constantly assaulted by information: news, memos, reports,statistics, politicians' financial disclosures, the charts in USA Today, theJournal's Heard on the Street column, the scandal of the day on &quot;A CurrentAffair.&quot; The volume grows more overwhelming as more deals are cut, more lawsare passed, and more books are published.andP;  The information you need is buriedby the information you don't need.andM;The culprit is information overload, a fancy new name for an age-old problem.andO;It's what happens when you try to juggle too many balls at once.andP;  You'rebound to miss something and drop the ball.andM;Because America's economy is increasingly an information economy, the problemis critical.andP;  Information is what we grow, manufacture, buy, and sell.andP;  Thefailure to cope with information overload means failure in today's economy.andO;An attorney has only days to prepare a case based on 100,000 pages ofdocuments.andP;  A stock analyst's job depends on knowing more about securitiesthan other analysts do.andP;  Of the thousands of news stories reported daily, amarketing manager must be able to pinpoint the events that could devastate aproduct's sales.andM;Personal computers haven't been wearing any white hats in this showdown.andP;  Toooften, in fact, they add to the problem.andP;  PCs subtly foster the illusionthat, given enough technology, it is both possible and desirable to knoweverything about anything.andM;&quot;There's a popular belief that computers will solve information overload, infact, create a paperless office.andP;  Instead the PC has allowed people to createan awful lot of data,&quot; says Brad Pelo, executive vice president of FolioCorp., makers of Views, a text retrieval program.andM;PCs dump massive quantities of indiscriminate data on our desks throughonline services, networks, and floppy disks that are passed out like peanutsat a cocktail party.andP;  Because PCs make it easier for those in the informationbusiness to do their jobs, fewer people now produce more information morequickly.andM;But what's success for those who produce information is a challenge to thosefaced with consuming it.andP;  Generally, PCs have been less effective at makingsense of data than at creating it.andM;The Peril of the information ProfessionalandM;Information overload isn't unique to the computer age.andP;  Facts always havehidden in obscure places, and some individuals possessed special skills forfinding them.andP;  A thousand years ago, a monk who could read was the mostimportant person in the countryside.andM;Today we call those with that special skill &quot;information surfers.&quot; They'reprofessionals who dive into the oceans of information created by today'stechnology and emerge with the gem that eludes other searchers.andP;  Likemedieval monks, the information surfers' importance rests not so much on howwell they've developed their talents as on the scarcity of their skill.andO;Society has been better served since literacy became a standard skill amongthe populace, and it will be better served still when the ability to findinformation is common.andM;That's because when only an elite few can invoke a needed technology, we'rein a situation fraught with peril.andP;  That situation exists in thebureaucracies that corporations create around data processing staffs.andM;Consider last year's infamous fiasco at Lockheed, when a  300-million problemdeveloped in the contract to build the P-7 anti-submarine aircraft.andP;  By allaccounts, the firm's executives were skilled and the executive-informationsystem was working exactly as planned.andP;  It simply wasn't relaying a key pieceof data that would have told Lockheed that the project was going awry-theweight of the aircraft.andM;&quot;The Lockheed problem shows why computers miss certain points,&quot; says BillBane, CEO of ManageWare, maker of the multidimensional financial-analysistool Compete.andP;  &quot;The crucial issue is deciding what to measure.andP;  The idea thatyou're going to measure everything is held only by those who are most naiveabout mathematics.andP;  You hear,  Keep your eye on the ball.' Somebody has todecide what the ball is.&quot;andM;Centralized, MIS-built systems take months to develop and even longer toupdate, and they seldom feel like an application developed by someone whounderstands the problem the application is supposed to solve.andP;  The bestcourse is to bring the byte-crunching, personalized power of PCs to bearagainst the problem.andM;&quot;You'll see more and more software applications that help people findinformation and deal with it well,&quot; says Nick Arnett, president of themonthly newsletter MultiMedia Computing and Presentations.andP;  He sees arealistic potential for &quot;smart&quot; software that would watch the things you dowith your PC and analyze the content of your data.andP;  It would use the patternsit finds to filter your mail, select newspaper stories for you, and summarizereports.andM;&quot;I like to call it &quot;Little Brother,' &quot; he says.andP;  &quot;I don't want Big Brotherwatching me, but I do want Little Brother.&quot;andM;No one's figured out yet how to make the personal computer do all the work,how to turn the PC into Little Brother.andP;  But PCs are still our last and besthope for rescue from the bottomless sea of information.andP;  Given the rightsoftware, your PC has the potential to keep great quantities of data afloat,to provide information tailored to your interests and to keep your desk clearof irrelevant details.andP;  Software that can do that without making you hold itshand all the time is just coming into existence, and it may soon be the mostvaluable program on your computer.andM;OK, so personal computers help create information overload.andM;They're also your best solution for digging out of it.andP;  A PC and the rightretrieval software make it a snap to find just the facts you need, when youneed them.andP;  The trick is knowing which package is best suited to yourparticular jumble of information.andP;  Here are some steps toward the bestsolution.andM;STEP 1: Identify the information you needandM;Sort through your paper and electronic files and separate them into threecategories according to the information they contain: information you useregularly, information you use sporadically, and information you never use.andO;(You don't actually need to separate your files into three stacks of paper orthree different subdirectories, but you must examine them systematically sothat you get an accurate picture of how you use information.)andM;To help you sort your information, think about the work you've done duringthe past few months.andP;  What information did you actually use? What informationthat you didn't use may still be helpful in the future? What information willjust accumulate in filing cabinets and disk files and never be touched?andM;Eliminate clutter by getting rid of the information you'll never use.andP;  Thenidentify the sources of information that you use regularly.andP;  If some of itcomes to you on paper-either from publications or from co-workers-see if youcan get it in electronic form.andP;  For files that are already in electronicform, make a note of whether they're stored in ASCII format or in a formatgenerated by an application such as Lotus 1-2-3, WordPerfect, or DBASE.andP;  Someprograms can search through all sorts of files generated by popular softwareapplications, while others work only with ASCII files.andM;Finally, make a list of information you could use but that you're notreceiving on a regular basis.andP;  Find out where you can get it-either fromsomeone on staff or from one of the online database services.andM;If you're setting up a system that must meet the needs of others in yourdepartment or company, your task is more extensive, but the essentials remainthe same.andP;  Find out what information others need, and divide it intocategories depending on whether it's accessed regularly or occasionally.andO;Identify sources of information within your organization and what format thatinformation is in.andP;  Find out whose information needs are not being met andhow they can be accommodated.andM;STEP 2: Determine how you'll use the information A system that handlesfrequent searches of reference files calls for different software than asystem for conducting occasional searches or for searching frequentlychanging files.andP;  Information that only you will use requires a differentretrieval system than information that many people will search.andM;Do the files or documents that make up your information overload havesomething in common that could serve as the basis for organizing them? Lookfor a pattern of client names, dates, topics-anything that regularly appearsin most of the files.andP;  Some programs lend themselves to organizing materialby keywords or fields that can be searched easily.andP;  On the other hand, if noregular pattern emerges, you'll need software that can search every word inyour files.andM;An information system that others will access has its own requirements.andP;  Yourselection of software will be influenced by how familiar others are with theinformation in the system and how they'll access it-from a single PC, througha network, or through an electronic or hard copy publication.andM;STEP 3: Select the right softwareandM;Once you've taken stock of the information you'll be searching, you're readyto select PC software.andM;On pages 77-89, we profile five retrieval programs that can tackle a varietyof information needs.andP;  No matter what program you're considering, check itout for the following features that will help or hinder you as you plowthrough your particular type of information overload.andM;*  INDEXING: A text retrieval index lists the locations of all thewords-except for the most common, such as the and it, in all the filesincluded in the index.andM;The advantage of indexing is that the software doesn't have to churn throughevery file each time you request a search.andP;  Instead, it consults the indexand instantly leads you to locations in each file that contain matches toyour request.andM;Indexing is preferable for software installed on a network.andP;  Without anindex, a search program must pull the entire text of every file through tothe workstation before it can be searched-which adds to the search time andburdens the network.andM;The disadvantage of indexing is that a file must be included in the index forit to be searched at all (although indexes can be updated to include newfiles and delete erased ones).andP;  Another problem is that indexes consume a lotof disk space.andM;Select a retrieval program with indexing if you often search the same set offiles or if you do your searches through a network.andP;  Choose a non-indexingprogram if you tend to search a variety of frequently changing files.andM;*  FIELDS: Though they're more often associated with traditional databases,fields are a boon for searching through files for information that falls intospecific categories.andM;For example, fields might contain the name of the author of a document, thedate it was created, and its title.andP;  Searches on fields are generally fasterthan searches through entire documents.andP;  In most cases, you'll have to defineand fill the fields manually, but it's worth the trouble if you're apt tosearch on those fields.andM;Use field-based software for material such as legal documents and memos thathave the same form and contain common items that are useful for searching,such as legal documents or menus.andM;*  FILE FORMATS: Some search programs can rummage through files stored in thenative format of your word processor, database, or spreadsheet.andP;  Others workonly with ASCII files.andM;Check whether the retrieval program you're looking at can handle files in theformats created by your favorite applications.andP;  Even if your programs canexport ASCII files, doing so is a time-consuming step that you should avoidif possible.andM;* BOOLEAN LOGIC: Boolean operators allow more versatile searches that raiseyour chances of finding the information you're looking for.andM;The most common Boolean conjunctions are and, or, and not For example, thesearch instruction to find &quot;Mary and John&quot; finds all documents that containboth the word &quot;Mary&quot; and the word &quot;John.&quot; The instruction &quot;Mary or John&quot;finds all documents that contain either of the words.andP;  A search for &quot;Mary notJohn&quot; reports on all documents that contain &quot;Mary&quot; unless they also contain&quot;John.&quot; Some programs let you narrow the search further depending on whetherthe search terms are within a specified number of words from each other.andO;Most search programs support the full range of Boolean operators.andP;  Avoidthose few that don't.andM;* FUZZY OR WILDCARD SEARCHES: The ability to do fuzzy or wildcard searchingis helpful when you don't know exactly how to spell a word you're looking foror when you want to search for a group of words with the same root.andM;A fuzzy search for  Schmidt&quot; will also find matches for words that sound likeSchmidt,&quot; such as &quot;Smith.&quot; A wildcard search function, like a DOS wildcard,allows you to search for words that contain specific letter patterns, such asmanage*&quot; to find  manage,&quot; &quot;managed,&quot;  &quot;manager,&quot; and &quot;management.&quot;andM;Programs that use fuzzy searches are less common than those that permitwildcard searches.andM;* HYPERTEXT: The ability to forge hypertext links-that is, links that connectone keyword to other text or a different document that has furtherinformation related to the word-is an advantage when users are unfamiliarwith the information and need to explore a topic.andP;  Most hypertext systemsrequire programming before they can be used effectively.andP;  Few are applicablefor spur-of-the-moment searching.andM;* CUT AND PASTE: In some cases, you'll be satisfied simply to know the namesand locations of the files that contain the information you're searching for.andO;If you're collecting citations for later reference, however, you'll want apackage that can define blocks of text from a variety of sources and pastethem into a master document.andM;* SECURITY: Not all information, particularly that generated internally, isfor everyone's eyes.andP;  If your information base will include sensitive data,the software that accesses it should have password-guarded access to lock outselected portions.andM;If the otherwise ideal program lacks security features, you can improvise bycreating two information bases, one with unprivileged information and theother with sensitive data.andP;  Put the private information in a separatedirectory and restrict access to it with a program such as Watchdog, fromFischer International Systems (800-237-4510), which password-protects drives,or by using the security features built into your local area network.andM;An information system designed for use by many people should take theircomputer experience into account.andP;  If you're developing a system forinexperienced users, select software that is menu-driven, lets you set upyour own menus, or provides other hand-holding.andM;Most of your information is text and will not be accessed on a network.andO;While using one of your main application programs, you sometimes unexpectedlyneed to find information from among a medium-size collection of text filesthat could be in any directory.andM;We recommend GOfer 2,0, a RAM-resident utility that searches through anyfiles for any specified text strings.andP;  You can paste the findings it displaysinto applications or other files.andM;Case Study:andM;Bob Schwabach, a syndicated computer columnist who lives near Chicago, islike many successful journalists: Prolific, disorganized, and addicted toresearch.andP;  During the past six years of writing about technology fornewspapers across the country, he has seen his hard disk become host to alibrary of articles on computer-related topics, most of which he wrote, plusassorted notes and reference files.andM;&quot;I do 52 columns a year, plus a dozen or so other articles for magazines.andO;And I probably write about 150 letters,&quot; he says.andM;Files such as these can be a tremendous resource, often containing nuggets ofinformation Schwabach can incorporate into new columns.andM;&quot;But I'm also a sloppy organizer,&quot; he admits.andP;  He has a stockpile oflong-forgotten documents with enigmatic filenames such as JUNE12.andP;  As asoftware reviewer, Schwabach also wrote articles using a variety of wordprocessors.andP;  To make his past articles worth saving, he needs to be able toextract information from them conveniently.andP;  He uses GOfer because it doesprecisely that with no hassles.andM;GOfer is the only search program I have on my disk-and I see them all,&quot; hesays.andM;Schwabach appreciates GOfer's speed-it goes through his 20MB of data in a fewminutes-and its support for Boolean search expressions.andP;  He also appreciatesits utter simplicity.andP;  &quot;When you call it, a very simple screen appears.andP;  Idon't have to remember a lot of commands.&quot;andM;The last time Schwabach used GOfer, he was working on a column about amathematical software package and wanted to include a roundup ofmath-education software programs.andP;  (&quot;I knew I'd written about them before,but who remembers when?&quot;) He simply popped up GOfer's search screen and toldit to explore his disk for all files containing the words &quot;math&quot; and&quot;education.&quot;andM;&quot;It pulled them all up in a minute or so,&quot; he says.andM;Other text-search programs may have fancier user interfaces or morefile-management features, he acknowledges, but those simply don't suit hispurpose.andP;  &quot;I want only one thing from a search program,&quot; he says, &quot;and that'sto find the damn document.&quot;andM;How to Use GOfer:.andM;Once GOfer is loaded into memory, press Alt-G (or any key combination youspecify) to pop up GOfer's &quot;Enter Text to Go For&quot; screen.andP;  Tell GOfer whichdirectory paths to search, and fill in one or more blank fields to indicatethe text you're looking for.andP;  You can alter extra settings to narrow thesearch-for instance, only occurrences of the word &quot;DOS&quot; that are within fivelines of the phrase &quot;OS/2.&quot; View search results as soon as GOfer finds each hit,&quot; or tell GOfer to write the results of the search to a separate file forreview when the search ends.andP;  In either case, you can define sections of textthat GOfer finds and paste them into an application in the foreground.andM;Pros: Requires no pre-indexing or formatting of files, and yet remains fast(searching 8MB per minute on a 386-based machine).andP;  Supports wildcardsearching-for instance, the search expression &quot;compa*&quot; will find referencesto Compaq&quot; and &quot;compatibles.&quot; Pastes chunks of retrieved text easily intoapplications.andP;  Memory requirement adjusts to suit system availability; whilethe full-scale RAM-resident version requires 128K, a limited-function versioncalled Tiny GOfer needs 68K; the smallest version keeps only GOfer's hotkeycommands in RAM, using 8K and loading the full program from disk or expandedmemory each time.andP;  Supports Boolean search expressions.andM;Cons: GOfer can access only directories in the same path.andP;  To look withinunconnected directories, it has to search the entire hard disk.andP;  Lack ofindexing makes it slow in searching large banks of data.andP;  The Bottom Line:GOfer is excellent for ad hoc searches of unformatted data with a minimuminterruption of the job at hand.andM;-Don SteinbergandM;Much of your information is in paper form.andP;  You manage large amounts ofinformation in both paper and electronic formats.andP;  Much of the informationfalls into predefined categories that are essential to organizing yourinformation base, but you also need the ability to search free-form text thatcan't be contained in specific categories.andM;We recommend askSam.andP;  The flatfile database askSam lets you create searchablefields without specifying a held length.andP;  It also allows you to searchpassages of text and to take advantage of hypertext links.andM;Case Study:andM;To prepare complex legal cases, lawyers at the medium-size law firm Curtis,Mallet-Prevost, Colt andamp; Mosle, in New York City, face sifting through tens ofthousands of pages of testimony, memos, and other case-related documents.andO;The full text of important documents is often available in ASCII-text formaton floppy disks, but the rest of the documents are on paper only.andM;The firm's litigation support staff once used a full-text searching programfor locating data on disk.andP;  But abstracts of paper documents were enteredinto a separate database program.andP;  Using two separate programs increased thelearning curve for staffers and limited the use of thecomputerized-document-management system.andP;  Research was taking longer than itshould have.andM;Litigation support manager Thomas Bollhofer replaced both programs withaskSam because of its ability to perform both full-text searches of ASCIIfiles and fixed-field searches for abstracted information stored in the samedatabase.andP;  To further simplify the search process, Bollhofer used askSam'shypertext features to create a simple menu-driven search system.andP;  Because thesystem is now easier to use, it has increased the use of the database,Bollhofer says.andM;Using askSam has cut the firm's case preparation time and cost.andP;  Forinstance, an eight-hour manual information search conducted by a paralegalcosting $100 an hour is done in about one hour using the PC-based system.andM;How to Use askSam:andM;Use askSam's menus to navigate through the program and create a database, aform for entering data, or new records.andP;  In the fields you create, storeinformation that is common to many of the documents you include in thedatabase and that you're likely to search for-names, dates, or projects, forexample.andP;  Index the fields only to speed searches in their categories.andO;Include lengthy, free-form text in its own field for ad hoe searches on anywork in the text.andM;Create abstracts of paper documents and store them in searchable fixed fieldsin the same database in which you store electronic data.andP;  An abstract maycontain, for example, the document's title, its file code and location, and adescription.andM;Perform searches using Boolean operators and wild cards, such as asterisksand question marks.andP;  Narrow searches by specifying how close two words in aBoolean search must be, such as  Compaq&quot; within the same sentence as &quot;harddrive.&quot;andM;Use askSam's hypertext feature to create a menu-driven application thatallows less experienced computer users to search for data.andP;  Or use itshypertext ability to change directions in midsearch.andP;  For example, if youbegin searching for &quot;PCs&quot; and encounter the word  Compaq&quot; while reading adocument, highlight the word and the program will search for it.andM;Pros:andM;Easy to use for searching both structured and unstructured fields andfree-form text files.andP;  Includes hypertext capabilities for creating menus andfacilitating searches.andP;  Easy-to-use, full-screen text editor with wordprocessing features lets you create memos and other documents, print them,and store them as database records.andP;  Includes an automatic dialer for phonenumbers stored in the database.andM;Cons:andM;Cryptic command language often involves odd characters such as colons,brackets, and curly brackets.andP;  Manual often lacks explanations to clear upcommand language confusion.andP;  Not a relational database.andM;The Bottom Line:andM;Ideal for searching, storing, and managing combinations of paper documents,structured data files and free-form text.andP;  Easy to use for basic queries, butthe command language is a pain.andP;  A proficient user can create a menuingsystem that protects the non-computer literate from the product's underlyingcomplexities.andP;  Randy RossandM;Much of your information is in formats other than ASCII on a standalone PC,You regularly create files using a variety of applications-word processor,spreadsheet, database-and you frequently need to find information containedin the files formatted by those programs.andM;We recommend Lotus Magellan 290,r a disk manager that includes the ability tosearch and view files in the formats of more than 40 programs.andP;  Once you havelocated a file that contains the information you want, Magellan lets you runthe application that created the file and load the file into the applicationsimultaneously.andP;  It does similar programs one better by including viewersthat can undelete files, edit text files, and look inside archived filescreated with ARC and PkZip utilities.andM;Case Study:andM;When Joe Salemi took over the position of project manager on contract to theNational Cancer Institute, in Rockville, Maryland, he discovered hispredecessor had left virtually all of his previous work-hundreds of computerfiles created with several different programs-uncataloged and in apparentdisarray.andM;To get a handle on his job-setting up a local area network to connect 1,200to 1,500 nodes throughout the institute-Salemi turned to Magellan.andP;  Itallowed him to work through &quot;a ton of documentation-maybe 200 to 300 Lotusspreadsheets and WordPerfect documents that were critical to us.&quot;andM;Salemi uses Magellan because he can see the item that he is searching for incontext.andM;&quot;There have been times when I have been able to find some things that Ididn't realize were on the disk because of Magellan,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;Magellanmakes my life as a project manager easier because I can find informationfaster than I could with any kind of manual method.&quot;andM;As a system operator on CompuServe, Salemi also finds Magellan helpful infielding questions from novice computer users curious about a wide variety oftopics.andP;  With Magellan, Salemi can search for answers that are stored on hisPC.andM;&quot;If someone asks a question, I can do a quick search on all of the savedmessages that I have,&quot; he says.andM;How to Use Magellan:andM;Use either indexed or unindexed searches.andP;  If you choose to index, beprepared to sacrifice some real estate on your hard disk to the index file.andO;Magellan creates an index that occupies about 5 to 7 percent of the totalnumber of files covered by the index.andP;  Also, the first time you index a largedrive, the process is time-consuming-a little over Eve minutes to index 5MBon an IBM PS/2 Model 80, using a drive with a 35-millisecond access time.andO;Subsequent updates that add new files to the index are quicker.andM;In return for indexing, Magellan gives you lightning-quick searches-responsetimes under two seconds are common.andP;  If you choose not to index, you don'tgive up any disk space for the index files, but the trade-off is slowersearches.andM;Magellan applies fuzzy searching by also spotting files that contain phrasessimilar to the one you told it to search for, and it displays the filenameswith a percentage that indicates the probability of a match.andM;Once Magellan has found a file that contains the information you're lookingfor, it recognizes the format of the file and automatically uses theappropriate viewer to display the file in the native screen format of theapplication that created it.andP;  Magellan includes viewers for most popularapplications, including WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, Lotus 1-2-3, MicrosoftExcel, IBM DisplayWrite, Quattro, and DBASE.andM;Pros:andM;Ability to view files found during a search and to run automatically theapplications that created them.andP;  Additional functions to undelete files, edittext files, and look inside archived files.andM;Cons:andM;Initial indexing is slow and must be performed on a regular basis forMagellan to be effective.andP;  Index eats up disk space equal to 5 to 7 percentof the files indexed.andM;The Bottom Line:andM;With its wide variety of file viewers and its file manipulation features,Lotus Magellan could become the only disk utility you need for managing thatmountain of information on your hard disk.andP;  Dale LewallenandM;Most of your information is in ASCII and word processing files and needs tobe accessed on a network, You have a large number of text files that isgrowing daily.andP;  Information in the files is in no particular form and coversa wide range of topics.andP;  You need to search the files frequently and quicklyfor any combination of topics.andM;We recommend ZyIndex, a powerful yet simple-to-use retrieval program thathelps you find information hidden deep in word-processor, straight ASCIItext.andM;Case Study:andM;Varied Directions Inc., a film production company in Camden, Maine, usesZyIndex to keep track of an entire decade.andP;  Since last summer, editors haveused ZyIndex to find film material and interviews appropriate for thesix-part PBS series &quot;Making Sense of the Sixties,&quot; a documentary coproducedwith WETA, in Washington, D.C., that is scheduled for broadcast in 1991.andM;According to Joanna M. Allen, director of media research, the companypossesses more than 1,000 films spanning those ten turbulent years.andP;  Sourcesinclude news shows, archives, historical societies, home movies, and featurefilms, as well as interviews to support the material on film.andM;&quot;You name it, it's in there,&quot; says Allen.andP;  &quot;The only way to keep track of itis through a database.&quot;andM;The database she uses contains a log of a film's title, maker, and subject,such as two minutes of Abbie Hoffman in Chicago.&quot; In the past, the companyused paper logs and relied on employees to remember where to find appropriatefootage.andP;  But one's memory tends to get foggy with more than 100 films tokeep track of, says Allen.andM;With ZyIndex, the editor of each one-hour segment of the series can searchthe massive sixties database for specific segments with far greater speed andaccuracy.andP;  Topics such as &quot;the American flag&quot; or &quot;demonstrations&quot; areindexed; searches can be as general as &quot;hippies&quot; or as specific as &quot;hippiecarrying a peace sign.&quot;andM;ZyIndex was recommended to Varied Directions by a consultant, who alsoassisted in developing the database.andP;  Allen says the paper logs are now justa memory and that ZyIndex will be used on less complex film projects simplybecause it's much faster.andM;&quot;I don't think I could live without it,&quot; Allen says.andP;  Now to Use XyIndox:ZyIndex requires two easy steps.andP;  First, it indexes the files you designate,which gives it a base for fast searches.andP;  Second, it lets you search indexedfiles for the words, phrases, or numbers you need.andM;You can index from a menu within ZyIndex that lets you view and select up to64 files at a time to add to the index, or you can enter commands directlyfrom the DOS prompt to index one file or multiple directories.andM;ZyIndex conducts fast searches for a particular word or phrase, supportingBoolean operators and wildcards.andP;  It ignores &quot;noise&quot; words, including a baseof common prepositions, pronouns, and conjunctions, and any others that youadd.andP;  A keystroke displays your documents with all search words highlighted;the information can be marked and printed or saved to a file.andP;  TheProfessional and Plus versions include a clean-up option to remove unwantedfiles completely.andM;Pros:andM;Fast ASCII and word-processing file searches, Boolean logic, menu interface,cut-and-paste ability.andM;Cons:andM;Requires files to be indexed before searching.andP;  Spreadsheet and databasefiles must be exported to ASCII.andM;The Bottom Line:andM;To justify the time required to index files, ZyIndex is best for situationsin which a large number of sizable word-processing files are searchedfrequently.andP;  Peggy WallaceandM;Most of your information is in varied formats and needs to be accessed byothers.andP;  You must make a large collection of data files from differentprograms accessible and clear to users who are unfamiliar with the content.andM;We recommend Folio Views 2.0, an information publishing system that createsan indexed, highly structured &quot;infobase&quot; that can be searched for keywordsand can contain links that combine features of hypertext and multimedia.andM;Case Study:andM;At the John Alden Life Insurance Company, a small group health insuranceprovider in Miami, people in separate departments needed to know what washappening elsewhere in the company.andP;  The company used Folio Views to solvewhat was essentially a communications problem.andM;&quot;Previously, we had a company newsletter that nobody read,&quot; says KennethMoore, the divisional network administrator who was assigned the task offinding a communications solution.andP;  He felt that Folio Views was the righttool to solve the problem.andM;Moore used Folio Views to create an infobase that is accessible from acompanywide network.andP;  The infobase has five areas of information: &quot;ComputerCentral,&quot; with instructions on how to use programs on the network; &quot;CorporateInformation,&quot; containing financial data, meeting minutes, and schedules;&quot;Personal Interests&quot; for those interested in running, aerobics, and the like;&quot;????,&quot; an area devoted to odds and ends; and &quot;New Information&quot; for newsevents.andM;A major benefit of Folio is that virtually no training is needed to use theinfobases successfully.andP;  People choose from a hierarchical menu system.andO;Folio's links allow them to press a key and, boom, they're reading thematerial that they've chosen.andP;  This setup is particularly useful when peopleneed to jump through information quickly, such as in the company's e-mailmanual.andM;Folio's search capability also lets the workers at Alden Life locateinformation from the entire infobase on a subject without using the menusystem.andP;  For example, Moore had been trying to persuade the company'sdie-hard Lotus 1-2-3 users to switch to Quattro Pro.andP;  After doing a search onQuattro Pro in the meeting minutes, he discovered that someone he thought wasbacking the switch was not.andM;The experience with Folio Views for internal communications has led thecompany to consider it for converting the sales procedures manual into aninfobase.andP;  &quot;It's been such a success that our use of it is going to grow,&quot;Moore says.andM;How to Use Views:andM;Because Views does not search the original files, you must first transformthe files into what Views calls an infobase.andP;  A separate program providedwith Views automatically recognizes the formats of several popular wordprocessors and ASCII files.andP;  You tell the program how to divide the files-byparagraph, page, document, or a division of your own making-into  folios,&quot;which Views uses to break the infobase into manageable blocks.andP;  If you chooseto have hypertext-like links, you must mark individual words manually or tellthe conversion program to mark words that are boldfaced, underlined, orsimilarly formatted in the original files.andM;Once you've created the infobase, use Views to search it by supplyingkeywords.andP;  If you join keywords in Boolean combinations, Views instantlytells you how many matches are in the infobase.andP;  Press the Tab key to jumpfrom one folio to another that contains a match.andP;  Overlapping windows displayseveral folios at once.andP;  You can add new files to an infobase, join twoinfobases, or, using the results of a search, create a new infobase that is asubset of a larger infobase.andM;You can create a menu that makes the infobase easier for others to use bytyping a text file that includes the menu items.andP;  Mark each menu item as alink, and the user simply tabs among the links to select topics in theinfobase.andP;  The links are not limited to text information.andP;  An infobase cancreate multimedia effects by linking to other programs that display graphicsor animation or play music.andP;  Ties to other programs are so smooth that theuser is unlikely to notice the transitions from Views and back again.andM;If you need to distribute your infobase to many users, use the PublisherViews version of the program to create infobases that have their own runtimemodule.andP;  There is no limit to the number of runtime versions you candistribute, but each runtime module reads only the infobase it was createdfor.andP;  If users need to search several different infobases, a read-onlyversion of the program, Previews, gives them access to an unlimited number ofinfobases.andM;Pros:andM;Versatile links can incorporate other programs to display a graphic or playmusic related to information found in text.andP;  Searches are fast and aided bymaps of complex Boolean combinations.andP;  Multiple matches are displayed inoverlapping windows.andP;  Runtime modules allow inexpensive distribution ofinfobases.andM;Cons:andM;Converting files to infobases requires extra effort.andP;  Multimedia andhypertext links must be created manually if they are to be effective.andO;Because Views does not use original files after it creates an infobase,original files should be deleted or archived to floppies to conserve harddrive space.andM;The Bottom Line:andM;Publishing and runtime features make Views ideal for low-cost distribution ofelectronic manuals and catalogs.andP;  Linking leads users to facts they might nothave realized were crucial to their searches.andM;-Ron White and Kathleen RichardsandM;Before You StartandM;Making the most of search software means changing your work habits.andM;Because search programs usually don't work across multiple directories, storerelated files in the same subdirectories.andM;If you choose a program that requires files to be indexed, work that choreinto your doily routine with batch instructions in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.andM;Be prepared to spend the time needed to feed old data into a program thatuses fields for keywords, and train yourself to fill in the fields for newdocuments.andM;If you set up an information system that others use, check to make sure thatthey're getting the information they need, that they can follow menus, andthat they're providing their share to the information base.andM;What if I don't want to do it?andM;Sometimes the easiest way to do a job is to pay someone else to do it.andP;  Ifthe job is staying on top of information, the person to hire is aninformation broker.andM;When Corning Inc., a Fortune 500 company, realized it had lost sales tocompetitors because of poor internal communications, the firm turned toStrategic Intelligence Systems.andM;SIS publishes databases of information related to specific industries andhelps companies such as Citibank, General Foods, and Eli Lilly withinformation overloads by creating custom databases and writing abstracts ofarticles and news that relate to their clients' businesses.andM;Ruth Stanat, president of SIS, used an information audit to find whyemployees weren't getting the information they needed to make Corningcompetitive.andM;&quot;We discovered that half the information we needed already existed atCorning,&quot; says Gary Roush, Corning's manager of business information.andM;A network and search software now provides all the departments within Corningimmediate access to the same store of information.andM;Information Strategists, of Manchester, New Hampshire, another broker, actsas librarian for businesses with $10 million to $30 million in revenue.andM;&quot;Companies need to go outside for information about 10 percent of the time,&quot;says Beth Duston, the company's president.andP;  She's found that people turn toinformation specialists because of the extreme cost of fumbling around inexpensive databases themselves.andP;  &quot;A cash register starts going the minute youlog on-that's what keeps people from doing their own searches,&quot; she says.andM;Duston offers this advice to those looking for an information broker: Makesure the broker has a solid background in the area you want searched.andP;  Takeheed of the adage, &quot;A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.&quot;andP;
