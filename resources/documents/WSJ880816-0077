Chipello (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FSBK </CO><IN> ERN TNM </IN><TEXT>   First Service Bank for Savings reported a huge $41.5 million second-quarter loss, and said it is suing its former president and former senior lending officer for fraud.    Eugene L. Sorbo, chairman of the Leominster, Mass.-based bank, said management is looking for ways to bolster the bank's dwindling capital, including a possible merger or sale. But the bank added: &quot;There are no negotiations in progress with any party for such a transaction.&quot;    As previously reported, C. William Wester, former chairman, president and chief executive officer, and Robert F. Fredo Jr., former senior vice president and senior lending officer, were forced to resign in June after federal and state banking authorities uncovered problems with the bank's real-estate development loans.    In its complaint, filed in a Worcester County court, First Service alleges that Messrs. Wester and Fredo &quot;engaged in massive fraud, negligence, violations of banking law and other breaches of duties and obligations to the bank.&quot; The suit calls for recovery of damages, which the bank currently estimates at more than $25 million, from the alleged misconduct.    Stephen R. Delinsky, an attorney for Mr. Wester, said: &quot;We strenuously deny the allegations.&quot; None of the loans in question are in default, according to Mr. Delinsky. The bank's board, he said, appears to be &quot;trying to scapegoat Mr. Wester and Mr. Fredo for problems&quot; that the directors had a hand in creating.    Mr. Fredo couldn't be reached for comment.    The second-quarter loss compared with a profit of $1.4 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. The loss included a provision for possible loan losses of $41.7 million and a write-down of real estate held for development and joint ventures totaling about $3 million.    Actual loan charge-offs for the quarter were $11.1 million, leaving $32.8 million in loan-loss reserves. The bank said additional charge-offs of as much as $14 million may be applied against the reserves upon completion of its review of problem loans identified to date.    A spokesman said that, while regulatory examinations are continuing, the bank's management believes that regulators &quot;may conclude that the bank's capital is below normally required minimums.&quot;    Yesterday, in national over-the-counter trading, First Service stock plunged to $5.50 from $6.38.    For the first six months, First Service reported a loss of $40.1 million, compared with earnings of $2.8 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
