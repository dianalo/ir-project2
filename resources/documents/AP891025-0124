Harold T. Duryee, head of FEMA's Federal InsuranceAdministration, said the agency is setting a Dec. 15, 1990,deadline for initial applications from communities seeking toqualify for premium adjustments under the program, called theCommunity Rating System.   The first flood insurance rate cuts will take effect Oct. 1,1991, in communities that qualify for them, he said.   Duryee said the agency also is trying to simplify proceduresinvolved with the flood insurance program, noting criticism in somecommunities that ``the program was so complex that people didn'twant to fuss with all that was necessary to get coverage.''   Frank Reilly, the FIA's deputy administrator, said about 2,000out of the nearly 18,000 communities now participating in theNational Flood Insurance Program will apply for premium reductionsunder the new rating system.   Currently, there are more than 2.1 million federal floodinsurance policies in force. Over the last 10 years, 350,000insurance losses have been paid out for a total of $2.5 billion.   An FIA summary of the Community Rating System said its goals areto ``are to encourage, by the use of flood insurance premiumadjustments, community and state activities beyond those requiredby the National Flood Insurance Program to reduce flood losses,facilitate accurate insurance rating and promote the awareness offlood insurance.''   ``Not only does such a system properly reward those communitiesthat are doing more than the minimum to protect their residentsfrom flood losses, it will will encourage communities to initiatenew flood protection activities,'' the paper said.</TEXT></DOC>
