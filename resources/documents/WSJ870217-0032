Sen. William Proxmire, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has begun an inquiry into whether investment bankers promote takeover activity primarily to enrich themselves with multimillion-dollar advisory fees. At the same time, his staff is drafting legislation to slow the pace of takeovers, curtail what he calls &quot;manipulative and deceptive practices,&quot; and make corporate raids more difficult and more costly.    One provision in the Wisconsin Democrat's bill would require raiders to line up 100% of their financing before they make a tender offer. It is designed to deter takeover bids launched on the strength of an investment banking firm's &quot;highly confident&quot; letter that financing can be raised, usually through the issuance of so-called junk bonds.    Another main provision would require all arbitragers, who speculate in takeover stocks, to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission and would bring risk arbitrage under tighter supervision, according to a Proxmire aide.    The insider-trading case involving Martin A. Siegel, one of Wall Street's leading investment bankers, and last week's arrests of three high-ranking arbitragers from Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. has strengthened the political hand of Mr. Proxmire and Michigan Democratic Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who is also preparing a package of takeover and insider-trading measures.    &quot;When you have firms of that caliber implicated, it begins to look like a cultural defect (in Wall Street), rather than aberrational behavior,&quot; said former SEC Commissioner A.A. Sommer Jr.    In coming months, the political pressure on the securities industry will be relentless as several securities and antitrust subcommittees scrutinize the business methods and mores of Wall Street. The round of hearings could take on the scope of the famous Pecora hearings, conducted by congressional staffer Ferdinand Pecora in the early 1930s after the stock market crash of 1929. &quot;It really could open Pandora's box,&quot; said Mr. Sommer.    Stanley Sporkin, former SEC enforcement chief and now a federal judge, recently called for a comprehensive examination of all the financial markets, patterned after the influential Cohen Commission study in the early 1960s in the wake of stock-manipulation scandals.    The latest arrests, Mr. Sporkin said yesterday, show that the need for another study of market trends and practices is &quot;greater than ever.&quot; Among other things, he said, the role of risk arbitrage should be scrutinized, particularly &quot;in view of the market game 'du jour', which I call Greed Gate.&quot;    Aides to Sen. Proxmire wouldn't elaborate on the arbitrage regulations under consideration. Richard Ketchum, the SEC's director of market regulation, said that registration of all arbitragers wouldn't be &quot;an unreasonable proposal.&quot; But he pointed out that many already are registered.    Both Sen. Proxmire and Rep. Dingell intend to shorten the 10-day period before investors must disclose stock holdings of 5% or more to the SEC. That &quot;10-day window&quot; often allows raiders to make so-called sneak attacks, and it allows unfounded rumors about hostile bids to build. Last year, the SEC recommended shortening the period to two days.    &quot;I'd make it 15 minutes,&quot; the senator said recently. &quot;There's no reason why people shouldn't know immediately.&quot; He would also lower the reporting threshold to a 1% stock holding.    Mr. Proxmire also plans to tighten regulations on investor groups that evade the reporting rule by limiting individuals' holdings to less than 5% when they are really acting in concert.    He has several measures in mind to slow the tender offer process and curb the manipulative practice of putting companies into play and cashing in on the resulting stock price rise, according to aides. They include requiring a bidder to have a firm commitment for 100% financing, imposing stricter margin requirements to reduce the bidder's leverage, and extending the tender offer period, conceivably to two or three months from the current 20 business days.    Such a stretch-out would give shareholders more time to weigh the bid and management more time to erect takeover defenses or find a friendly suitor to rescue the company from a raider.    The full-financing requirement appears aimed at the &quot;fully confident&quot; letter that Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has used so successfully in highly leveraged takeovers. Mr. Ketchum said the requirement would make it harder for a small company to swallow a larger concern.    Mr. Proxmire's bill would stop the so-called creeping takeover, requiring a formal tender offer for any purchase of a company's stock after accumulating a 15% stake in that company. It would also impose a two-week cooling-off period, during which a bidder who has terminated a tender offer would be unable to buy or sell any of the target company's stock.    The objective is to stop a hostile bidder from buying stock on the open market without honoring the investor-protection provisions of the Williams Act, which governs tender offers.    In scrutinizing the role of investment bankers, Mr. Proxmire has asked the SEC for summaries of all enforcement actions against the 10 Wall Street firms that are most active in mergers and acquisitions, and of all enforcement actions against their employees in the past five years. He has also asked the Congressional Research Service to find how much investment bankers earned from hostile takeovers in the past two years and what percentage of their firms' profits comes from advising raiders.    The latest cases aren't likely to spur the five-member SEC into any major rule-making initiatives. The commissioners, all Reagan appointees who generally share a free-market philosophy, appear inclined to await the results of the government's huge Wall Street investigation before adopting any new takeover rules.    Many lawmakers and lobbyists, meanwhile, believe that the current focus on takeover abuses and insider trading will expand into a broad review of corporate governance and business ethics. Some said the fallout from Wall Street will slow financial deregulation and may even lead to reregulation.    &quot;This whole syndrome,&quot; said conservative political theorist Kevin Phillips, &quot;calls into question economic Darwinism.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
