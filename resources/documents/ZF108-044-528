(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Competition heats up in database serversandM;System integrators are currently focusing on the database server, aclient-server system.andP;  This system divides the traditional PC database intotwo parts: a front end, or client application seen by the user, and aback-end database engine, or server, that performs the computation- anddisk-intensive data-management tasks.andM;Where a file-server system sends out to PCs not only copies of programs butalso whole data files, a database server lessens network load by centralizingrecord manipulation at the server.andP;  The database server sends only the dataneeded by a client application.andM;In such a system, the processing is cooperative: The work once done by asingle process on a single CPU is now divided into multiple processes onmultiple CPUs collectively called a multi-tasking database server.andP;  Thisserver responds to requests from many client programs, with each PCmanipulating the data in its own way.andM;In most of these systems the link between the human at the PC and thedatabase manager on the server is some version of the structured querylanguage (SQL).andP;  The front-end program sends SQL queries to the databaseengine on the server, where they are parsed and executed and the requesteddata sent back to the PC.andM;Client-server database management systems (DBMS) are modular systems thatwill accept different front ends.andP;  In fact, with a friendly enough front end,the user doesn't have to know anything about SQL or where or how theinformation is stored.andM;The specifics of client-server database architectures vary, but the commonelements include:andM;* The database server or engine, residing on a dedicated computer or thenetwork file server;andM;* The client program, an application or development tool, running on a PC;andM;* A layer of communication software that talks to the network software oneach end of the process.andP;  On the client end iths called a requester,redirector or router and is generally loaded separately so it can handlequeries from different front ends.andM;The remainder of the design depends upon the capacities of the hardware, theoperating system (MS-DOS or OS/2) and the LAN software (NetBIOS-, IPX- ornamed-pipes-based).andM;Real-world issuesandM;John Semmer, president of Technology Exchange Inc., spent the early part ofhis career with mainframes.andP;  But Semmer sees that in the PC worldclient-server databases represent &quot;a 180-degree change from the way we'vedone things in the past.andP;  We've thought of data as being connected toprograms, but the SQL concept separates data from the front-end application.&quot;andM;Meanwhile, Semmer's company has been evaluating the SQL Server jointly fromMicrosoft Corp., Sybase Inc. and Ashton-Tate Corp.andP;  And while his companywill probably install its first system within six months, Semmer thinks thatit will be years before the database server is a &quot;vanilla concept&quot; in the PCenvironment--perhaps after an 80386-specific version of OS/2 is available.andM;Tim Christian, senior network consultant at Connect Computer, feels that thetrade-off between data access and security is more important thanperformance.andM;On mainframe systems, administrators are able to enforce policies regardingaccess and integrity and to make sure MIS programmers build appropriatesafeguards into their applications.andP;  Such discipline is nearly impossible toimpose on a heterogeneous, independent group of programmers and users on aPC-based LAN.andM;A LAN multiuser database requires not only access rules but also controlsover data at record and field levels, as well as transaction tracking.andP;  Thetracking allows the data to be restored to a known state following a systemfailure.andP;  These features ought to be an integral and automatic part of thedatabase server, not something that must be invoked by the client program.andO;This is possible when the operating system &quot;owns&quot; the hardware and othersystem resources, as in the case of OS/2.andM;Database server products are available in three categories:andM;* The servers proper;andM;* Front-end products divided into development tools for building applicationsfor PC or mainframe environments and office-automation applications for theend-user;andM;* Connectivity products to address server-client communication, within orbetween LANs or through gateways to midrange and mainframe machines.andM;Perhaps becuase the field is still unsettled, end-user &quot;shrink-wrap&quot;applications have been slow to appear, though prominent database andspreadsheet companies have announced SQL versions of familiar programs.andM;One of the most ambitious enterprises is represented by the SQL Serveralliance.andP;  Sybase's core technology for mainframe and midrange computers hasbeen adapted by Microsoft for PC-class servers running OS/2 and LAN Manager.andO;This technology is being marketed by Ashton-Tate on its own and as the enginefor an SQL version of dBase IV.andM;For Microsoft this is a strategic product: an integratedoperating-system/core-application platform intended to capture the future ofhigh-end, PC-based networked computing.andP;  (The LAN products of two other majorvendors promise interoperatibility with OS/2-LAN Manager technology: IBMCorp.'s LAN Server and 3Com Corp.'s 3+Open LAN Manager.)andM;According to Microsoft, a key advantage of its sysem is that the LAN Managerruns as an application under OS/2 on the server and PC and provides:andM;* Cosinstency and efficiency across the network--the same ApplicationProgramming Interfaces (APIs) and communication facilities;andM;* Multitasking, multithreaded processes on both server and PCs;andM;* Distributed-processing application support where client and servercommunicate via interprocess features (for example, named pipes);andM;* A variety of standard network transport protocols (TCP/IP, Open SystemsInterconnection--OSI, NetBIOS) without needing gateways.andM;SQL Server communicates with OS/2 at the hardware level and runs as a single,multithreaded process.andP;  It employs &quot;stored procedures,&quot; which are precompiledSQL queries that increase performance and allow central enforcement ofdata-integrity rules.andM;Up and runningandM;System One Corp., a division of Texas Air, produced what probably is thefirst large-scale application using the Microsoft line.andP;  Its Fare Assurancesystem was developed using OS/2 and Microsoft's LAN Manager and a prereleaseversion of SQL Server.andM;System One chose SQL Server because:andM;* It needed mini-like performance and structure for database management and ahost-based system to hook into the standard travel-agency situation(terminals hooked to a mainframe with booking data queued to variousdepartments).andM;* It had two existing DOS applications (Air Planner and Air Auditor), Cprogramming experience and a familiar set of development tools.andM;Last spring, the Fare Assurance system started with two &quot;server&quot; and two&quot;client machines,&quot; although that distinction is less defined in this casethan it is in the more familiar NetBIOS-based LANs.andP;  The machines chosen werethe IBM PS/2 Model 80s and IBM PS/2 Model 70s.andM;By fall, the two &quot;servers&quot; were connected to 10 &quot;clients.&quot;andP;  These machinescommunicate with the company's Computer Reservation System's IBM 3090mainframes in Miami via a 9.6K-baud dedicated phone line used for booking,scheduling and fare information.andM;Two smaller companies have for several years of offered full lines ofproducts.andM;Gupta Technologies Inc. and XDB Systems designed modular systems with fullsets of development tools that are able to run in standalone or multiuserenvironments.andP;  Both companies are staying in the SQL DBMS race by continuingto adapt their products for new operating environments and signing upthird-party companies to provide front ends for their servers.andM;Gupta's SQLBase Multi-User Database Server runs under MS-DOS or OS/2, orUNIX- and NetBIOS-compatible LANs (an OS/2-LAN Manager version with namedpipes support is in development).andP;  The Gupta's SQL/API developer toolsinclude APIs and libraries for C, COBOL, Windows and Presentation Manager.andM;Also, WorldTech System Inc.'s Clipper dBase compiler is available now andwill support Lotus Development Corp. DataLens drivers and Microsoft Excel.andO;The Gupta connectivity product, SQLNetwork, provides access to data onmainframes through a PC gateway.andM;In its DOS-NetbIOS version, SQLBase should run on a dedicated server ratherthan on the file server.andP;  The SQL Network gateway, which requires IBM'sAdvanced Program-to-Program Communications for PCs (APPC/PC) software, alsois placed on a separate station, a &quot;session server.&quot;andM;Scheduler allows sharingandM;SQLBase even works around one of DOS' limitations by means of a scheduler.andO;Gupta spokesman Ron Zimmerman explains: &quot;The scheduler allows many users toshare SQLBase simultaneously, even under MS-DOS, which is a single-user,single-task operating system.andM;The SQLNetwork allows SQLBase applications to access data on mainframe hosts,currently DB2 data on IBM 370-compatibles, with Oracle Corp. support indevelopment.andP;  And the SQL Network Gateway is the PC (or &quot;session server&quot;) endof the system, a memory-resident program that routes SQL transactions toremote databases.andP;  An SQL host, installed on the mainframe, receives andtranslates SQL queries from clients, passes them to the mainframe DBMS andreturns the results to the appropriate client.andP;  The current release requiresa token-ring or SDLC connection to the mainframe and IBM's APPC/PC softwareon the Gateway machine.andM;Connecting products from different vendors has become an important issue.andP;  Inthe past, the solution has been to port to all the different platforms; inthe future, the solution will be connectability rather than portability.andM;Another important product for Gupta is SQLWindows, a Windowsapplication-development environment that generates the necessary code forboth screens and data manipulation.andP;  Zimmerman says, &quot;SQLWindows is anopen-architecture product.andP;  Today it works with our own SQLBase Server onDOS, OS/2 and soon [with] UNIX and NetWare 386.andP;  We have gateways underdevelopment that will simultaneously connect SQLWindows to any version ofOracle and OS/2 Extended Edition Data Manager.&quot;andM;A related product under development is Express SQL.andP;  According to DanBerkowitz, Gupta's marketing communication manager, it is &quot;a collection oftools that will allow users to manage and examine data on screen and togenerate reports, without knowing SQL.andM;XDB also offers developers a full line of products for standalone andclient-server systems.andP;  In addition to the XDB-Server, there are librariesand preprocessors for C and COBOL, tools for developing input and query formsand tools for producing reports and graphs directly from the database.andM;The XDB-Server for NetBIO LAN's (OS/2 version in development) runs on one ormore dedicated machines.andP;  On the client end of the system, the XDB SQLrequest redirector connects development tools and applications to the XDB SQLEngine at the server.andP;  The Engine is a memory-resident application, loadableinto extended memory on an 80286- or 80386-based machine with XDB-XM to saveconventional DOS memory.andP;  It can run on a stand-alone computer.andM;The Engine is also compatible with IBM's DB2 DBMS so that, with the XDB-DB2Workbench and the appropriate COBOL compiler, mini and mainframe applicationscan be developed and maintained on a PC-class computer.andM;Oracle has ported the Oracle Server to OS/2.andP;  It has also developed productsto provide a transparent link between the Oracle Server DBMS and the user'sfront-end program.andM;According to Network Prodcuts Division director of marketing, Gene Shklar,the goal is for the remote database to be invisible to the client program.andO;Probably more interesting for PC users are two of Oracle's connectivityproducts.andM;* SQL*Net is a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) program that resides on bothclient and server machines.andP;  It provides the necessary network andcommunication links between the application and the database server and amongmultiple Oracle servers via the network transport layer.andM;* SQL*Connect is a &quot;database gateway&quot; that lets Oracle systems talk to othervendors' servers.andP;  It functions primarily as a translator of SQL requests anderror codes.andM;Btrieve record-management systemandM;Novell Inc.'s SQL products emphasize development tools for either single userof multiuser environments.andP;  Announced third-party front ends include Clipper,Randamp;R Report Writer, DataLens and Paradox.andP;  Fox Software is also planning itsown SQL database server, Fox Server, as a superset add-on for NetWare SQL.andO;The Fox Server will support all the fron ends designed for Novell, as well asFox's own FoxPro DBMS.andM;A typical multiuser database system includes NetWare SQL and Btrieve (aphysical record-management system), running on the LAN server andapplications and the SQL Requester on PCs.andP;  The NetWare SQL multiuserrelational database engine operates as a NetWare value-added process (VAP) onthe file server, parsing queries and maintaining the data dictionary.andM;On the client end, the XQL development language has two layers--relationalprimitives and SQL--and can build either standalone (with Btrieve) orfront-end applications.andM;In the multiuser SQL mode, NetWare SQL Requester software passes applicationqueries to the network and thence to the database manager.andP;  Novell suppliesXQL interfaces for popular versions of BASIC, C, COBOL and Pascal.andM;Xtrieve Plus is a menu-driven data-management tools that allows either ad hocor repeatable queries, reports, analyses and updates.andP;  It uses the samedata-dictionary structure as XQL, allowing the views created by XQLapplications to be used by Xtrieve.andP;  The import and export of DIF and SDFfiles are supported, and data may be directly imported into Lotusspreadsheets.andM;A Novell SQL system block diagram resembles those of other server systemsuntil it comes to handling physical records.andP;  After the NetWare SQL serverhas processed an incoming query, it issues commands to Btrieve to fetch thephysical data.andP;  This data is then passed back across the network to therequester and application.andM;Since Btrieve is a separate process with its own commands and languagesupport, it can act as a non-SQL server process by itself.andP;  In this case, theapplication program passes Btrieve calls through a Btrieve requester to therecord manager on the file server.andM;Record-oriented vs.andP;  set-orientedandM;Ashton-Tate's well-publicized problems with the SQL portions of dBase IV haveled some skeptics to wonder whether the record-oriented dBase world can adaptto the set-orientation of SQL without unacceptable losses of performance.andO;The skeptics include dBase inventor Wayne Ratliff who is president of RatliffSoftware Production Inc. (See &quot;Life without SQL&quot;).andM;Ratliff's own product, Emerald Bay, is a record-and pointer-orientedmulti-asking, multiuser system that runs under MS-DOS ad NetBIOS or IPXnetwork software.andP;  Ratliff says: &quot;SQL is not the end-all.andP;  While it is a goodway to access mainframe databases--it is relatively common and almost (butnot quite) standardized--its batch-like processing and set-orientation is notwell-suited to the way PC users are accustomed to accessing and manipulatingdata.&quot;andP;  He thinks a UNIX version would offer a better prospect right now.andO;Still, Ratliff has an SQL component under development.andP;  And should OS/2 catchon, the Ratliff team will port Emerald Bay to it.andM;In any case, several dBase clones are already available--Oracle versions ofWordTech's dBXL and Quicksilver, with a FoxPro version soon to come.andM;Meanwhile, Ken einstein of Borland International Inc. emphasizes thedesirability of &quot;congruence&quot; between front-end and back-end architectures.andO;He points out that Paradox is already relational, making it a close fit toSQL Server.andP;  The SQL version of Paradox will run with SQL Server--IBM'sExtended Edition Database Manager--and the Oracle Server in its PC andmainframe incarnations.andM;The familiar Paradox interface will conceal from the user the machinery ofdata access.andP;  The Query by Example (QBE) process will be translated into SQLqueries and then sent to the server.andP;  All returning data is put into aParadox answer table.andP;  SQL queries included in Paradox Application Language(PAL) programs will likewise be handled automatically by Paradox.andM;Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3 will communicate with SQL databases through theDataLens API that Lotus has made available to server developers.andP;  Majordevelopers will supply finished DataLens drivers for installation on the PCend of their systems.andM;To communicate with the database server, the user will install the driverfrom inside the Lotus program; thereafter, standard Lotus commands can beused to access the server's data.andP;  Supported servers will include those fromcompanies like Gupta, IBM, Microsoft/Sybase and Novell.andM;Delivers on promiseandM;Micro Decisionware's PC/SQL-link delivers to users of PC decision-supportsoftware much of what has been promised by network-based client-serverDBMSes--the ability to send SQL queries to a central database and to get theresults into their PC software.andP;  PC/SQL-link works with a mainframe orminicomputer but not with a PC-class server.andM;Like its entirely PC-based cousins, the PC/SQL-link has a back-end segmentthat is installed on the host and remains invisible to the user on the PCend.andP;  The mainframe MIS staff can determine which databases will beaccessible, set passwords and other security matters, and establish andmaintain a host library of standard SQL requests.andP;  Supported host databasesinclude IBM DB2 and SQL/DS, Tandem Computers Inc. Nonstop SQL, Bull PDQ andRDBC, Teradata DBC/1012 and ShareBase.andP;  Supported communications linksinclude 3270 emulators, APPC/PC, asynchronous modem and various LAN gateways.andM;According to Jim Erickson, a Minneapolis-area field-support representativefor Micro Decisionware, the PC/SQL-link program is for PC users ofspreadsheats and databases who need regular access to mainframe data.andM;As PC of LAN users, they are not accustomed to asking MIS people to writespecial data-retrieval programs.andP;  Instead, they have relatively free accessto data and use different standard applications to deal with it.andM;With the PC/SQL-link, users can choose from a library or requests or fram newones by stepping through a series of menus.andP;  Experienced SQL users can writenew requests in &quot;free form.&quot;andP;  In addition, the USE statement will call arequest from a host-based library.andP;  The PC/SQL-link maintains at the PC adata dictionary or &quot;local catalog&quot; containing information about the tablesand columns in the host database.andM;Russell Letson is owner of Microcomputer Consulting, a company that providessoftware and hardware documentation services.andP;  He is frequent magazinecontributor.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
