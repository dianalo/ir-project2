The 9-0 decision is a big victory for federal regulatorswho are overseeing the savings-and-loan cleanup. If theSupreme Court had said that federal law allows such lawsuits,there could have been hundreds of cases filed against theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution TrustCorp., which have superseded the Federal Home Loan Bank Boardand the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. in trying tostraighten out the thrift industry.</LP><TEXT>   In an opinion written by Justice Byron White, the highcourt reversed the October 1989 decision of a federal appealscourt in New Orleans. The appeals court had said a $25million lawsuit could proceed against federal regulators fortheir management in 1986 and 1987 of Independent AmericanSavings Association of Irving, Texas.   Also yesterday, in an unrelated Sandamp;L case, the appellatecourt for the third time this month affirmed the right ofthrift regulators to seize insolvent thrifts, even if thetakeover violates a previous agreement between the thrift andgovernment regulators.   In the case before the Supreme Court, the lawsuit wasfiled in 1987 by Thomas Gaubert, a former Democraticfund-raiser and onetime chairman of Independent American. Mr.Gaubert claimed that he lost $25 million in property thatbank regulators required him to pledge to shore up the networth of the thrift. He also asked for $75 million in damagesfor the lost value of his shares in the thrift, of which hewas majority shareholder.   The pledge of property was part of an agreement in whichMr. Gaubert gave up control of the Texas thrift in exchangefor regulators agreeing to drop an inquiry into his role inan Iowa thrift. While under the control of federalregulators, the Texas thrift's value dropped from $75 millionto a $400 million deficit, wiping out the value of Mr.Gaubert's property.   Mr. Gaubert sued under the Federal Tort Claims Act, whichallows some lawsuits for damages against the government. Butthe Tort Claims Act includes a major exception, barringliability if government employees were performing&quot;discretionary&quot; functions.   The New Orleans appeals court ruled that this legalexception for discretionary actions applies only to policydecisions, not to day-to-day management. The appeals courtbarred Mr. Gaubert from pursuing his $75 million claim forthe lost value of his shares but allowed him to proceed withhis lawsuit for $25 million in lost property.   In appealing to the Supreme Court, federal officialswarned that the appeals court decision would expose theTreasury to &quot;potentially massive liability.&quot;   The high court reversed the appeals court decision andruled that the regulators' actions were covered by theexception and can't serve as the basis for a lawsuit.&quot;Day-to-day management of banking affairs, like themanagement of other businesses, regularly require judgment asto which of a range of permissible courses is the wisest,&quot;Justice White wrote. &quot;Discretionary conduct is not confinedto the policy or planning level.&quot;   Lawyers for other former owners of defunct banks andthrifts said they weren't surprised by the ruling, given thelow success rate of suits that seek to hold the governmentliable for discretionary actions.   And because a Supreme Court reversal was widely expected,few lawyers had embraced the New Orleans court's decisionthat allowed Mr. Gaubert to press his claim.   Nevertheless, the case was closely watched. &quot;If the NewOrleans court had been affirmed, there would have been a lotmore litigation,&quot; said Charles Cooper, a Washington lawyerwho represents failed thrifts in suits against thegovernment.   Mr. Gaubert's lawyer, Abbe David Lowell of Washington,said in a statement that he will continue to press Mr.Gaubert's claims related to the failure of IndependentAmerican Savings in other courts. &quot;We have not lost the war,&quot;he said.   Mr. Gaubert, meanwhile, has been a target of federalprosecutors, despite his acquittal in 1988 on charges relatedto loans from a now-defunct Iowa thrift. (U.S. vs. Gaubert)   Separately, in the appeals court case, the federal appealscourt in Atlanta reversed a lower court decision that barredregulators from seizing Guaranty Financial Services Inc.,Warner Robins, Ga.   Thrift regulators had allowed Guaranty and other thriftsto account for certain non-cash items as capital, a practicethat often masked their increasing losses. Thesavings-and-loan bailout law, however, toughened accountingrules and disallowed accounting for those items as capital.The appellate court ruled that the regulators were withintheir authority to abandon the old agreement and enforce thenew law.   Last week, the U.S. Claims Court ruled against AmericanContinental Corp., the Irvine, Calif., parent company ofLincoln Savings andamp; Loan, which was seized by regulators in1989. American Continental had argued that the property wasunlawfully taken by the government without compensation.Lincoln's failure is expected to cost taxpayers $2.5 billion.   Federal regulators said that they were gratified thecourts emphasized the discretion that the government has inthrift takeovers.</TEXT></DOC>
