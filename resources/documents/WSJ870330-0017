Popejoy looks the part of a chief executive officer. Indeed, a competitor once decribed Mr. Popejoy, chairman of Financial Corp. of America, parent of the nation's largest thrift, as &quot;the CEO from Central Casting.&quot;    The 49-year-old Mr. Popejoy's image as a conservative, clean-cut thrift industry veteran was one of his major selling points when federal regulators suggested him to replace the flamboyant Charles Knapp in August 1984 after Financial Corp. nearly collapsed because of a $6.8 billion run.    Partly by appearing in television commercials for American Savings andamp; Loan Association, the company's major unit, Mr. Popejoy was able to stanch the flow of deposits. To the relief of competing thrifts, he promised to shrink Financial Corp. and reduce its proportion of fixed-rate mortgages.    But in the past six months, Mr. Popejoy has drawn a storm of industry criticism -- most of it anonymous -- for apparently not sticking to his script. He increased Financial Corp.'s loans and other assets during 1986 by 24% to $33.95 billion and continued to make mostly fixed-rate loans -- both potentially risky moves if the economy should sour, hurting borrowers' ability to repay, or if interest rates soar again, depressing the value of fixed-rate assets.    Mr. Popejoy contends that Financial Corp. had to grow to earn enough interest income to cover operating expenses and the cost of carrying about $2.5 billion of nonperforming loans and real estate. &quot;If we would have continued to shrink, we would have failed, and fallen right on top of FSLIC,&quot; he says, referring to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.    Meanwhile, Edwin J. Gray, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, has been seeking a buyer for Financial Corp. Friends of Mr. Popejoy say this has infuriated him, because Mr. Gray pledged in a January letter that he wouldn't take any action against Financial Corp., based on the thrift unit's failure to meet minimum capital requirements, for more than a year. Mr. Popejoy and Mr. Gray decline to comment directly on the issue.    Since the 1984 run, Financial Corp. has submitted quarterly business plans for the Bank Board's approval.    Mr. Popejoy has worked -- and played -- hard all of his life, but he came to the thrift business by a circuitous route.    During his senior year in high school in Sacramento, Calif., Mr. Popejoy managed three gas stations, played football and ran track. At 19, he married his high-school sweetheart, a straight-A student and head cheerleader whom he had known since grammar school. He worked his way through college on the swing shift at an aerospace plant, and had to give up football until his senior year.    Mr. Popejoy sprinkles his conversation with sports metaphors, speaks frequently of teamwork, and says he once wanted to be a football coach. &quot;I was a lackluster student in high school,&quot; he says. &quot;I was interested in sports, cars and girls.&quot; During his nine years at the aerospace plant he became labor-relations manager, partly because he worked well with people.    At 29, Mr. Popejoy moved to Beverly Hills to work for a real estate firm. A colleague later took him to Washington for a job with the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., an arm of the Bank Board.    In 1974, he became president of American Savings, then controlled by Mark Taper, a wealthy and autocratic British-born entrepreneur who later sold the Sandamp;L to Financial Corp. Chafing under Mr. Taper, Mr. Popejoy left in 1980 to run two other thrifts in quick succession. The second, Financial Federation Inc., was sold in 1983. Mr. Popejoy was paid about $3 million in the transaction and retired at age 45.    When Mr. Popejoy got a call from Mr. Knapp a year later asking if he was interested in running Financial Corp., Mr. Popejoy quickly said yes. The executive acknowledges that a major disappointment in his life has been that he had &quot;failed to get Mr. Taper's complete confidence,&quot; and that he took the Financial Corp. job &quot;to show Mr. Taper I could do it.&quot;    Contrasting himself with Mr. Taper, whom he describes as &quot;a genius,&quot; Mr. Popejoy says, &quot;I'm not. I'm a guy who has to work hard to get things done.&quot;    While many analysts and competitors are negative about Mr. Popejoy's strategy for putting American Savings on firm footing, those who have worked with Mr. Popejoy are more positive. &quot;I think he has done an outstanding job with a situation that I believe is impossible to solve,&quot; says Ernest M. Fleischer, chairman of a large Kansas thrift who served as a Financial Corp. consultant. &quot;He has extremely good people skills and a good understanding of the problems&quot; at Financial Corp.    Almost without exception, Mr. Popejoy is described as likable. This storehouse of good will has helped get him through difficult times. &quot;He's been a very good friend of all of us for years,&quot; says one chief executive of a large California thrift who otherwise is sharply critical of Mr. Popejoy's strategies. &quot;It's clearly important for Financial Corp. that he's a nice guy.&quot;    Largely because of the time spent dealing with regulators and the 700 lawsuits pending against the company, Mr. Popejoy delegates much authority to a handful of top managers.    Mr. Popejoy has slashed costs, including his own salary, and shifted the corporate offices to less-expensive space. His corner office is modest -- the furniture once belonged to American Savings' Orange County loan manager -- but has a sweeping view of the Saddleback Mountains.    He is philosophical about the future. The Bank Board no longer has the power to fire him, he says, adding: &quot;If they called and said, 'Bill, we think you should leave,' I probably would.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
