WIELAND</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CORSICANA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When towering thunderstorms threaten,Lloyd Huffman fires up the Doppler radar he built from militarysurplus parts.   Unlike conventional radar, Doppler can detect the speed anddirection of raindrops within a storm, allowing Huffman to spotrotation that could indicate the formation of a tornado and warnthe weather service and local authorities.   ``It just kind of grew over the years,'' Huffman said of theradar he's been tuning up in anticipation of the April-through-Junetornado season.   With a few differences _ cost being a big one _ Huffman's S-bandDoppler is like the NEXRAD system being tested at the NationalSevere Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla., and planned fornationwide installation in the coming decade.   Huffman asked the laboratory for the plans to build his Doppler.``After they believed us, they gave us the information we needed,''he said.   Huffman built his first radar station in 1976, using World WarII surplus Army and Navy equipment and putting the antenna on thelocal hospital. He began working in 1979 on the present station,which became Doppler-capable in 1985.   ``I'm very interested in thunderstorm structure,'' he said.   Huffman, 42, has a degree in physics from North Texas StateUniversity. After working as a communications systems designer forMotorola in Dallas, he returned to his hometown in 1974 and startedhis own communications business.   Huffman and his crew staff the station whenever severe weatheris possible. He's in microwave link with WFAA-TV in Dallas andtalks by radio with National Weather Service meteorologists in FortWorth.   The radar can detect rain intensity for several hundred miles,but can only process Doppler information for about 150 miles. Theradar pulses about 1,000 times a second, sending a beam about 1{degrees wide. The reflected data is sorted into ``range bins'' each150 meters deep.   A computer remembers and compares the location of raindrops,allowing it to determine the speed and direction. ``The speed ofrotation is the rate of change of phase angle _ that's thevelocity,'' Huffman explained.   The computer assigns a color to each velocity _ red indicatesmovement toward the station, green is away _ painting a picture ofthe storm. The right combination of colors on the southwest cornerof a thunderstorm provides a ``meso-cyclone vortex signature,''indicating rotation.   After several minutes of observation and tilting the radar beamup and down, Huffman might spot elongation into a cylinder thatcould mean a tornado. He then makes sure the National WeatherService knows and uses police-band radios to notify authorities insurrounding counties.   Huffman has the money to upgrade his system by speeding up thecomputer and adding memory but said ``it takes a lot of time. It'sa mechanical, electrical, electronic and computer project _ alittle of everything involved in in it.''   He calls the project ``a good community thing to do.''   It is funded by the Navarro Community Foundation, money fromwealthy families that profited from two oil booms. Operatingexpenses are covered by WFAA-TV in Dallas, which shows the radarduring weathercasts. The station sits on an acre provided by theCorsicana Independent School District. A donated 80-foot oilderrick supports a 25-foot-diameter Fiberglas dome containing the16{ foot dish antenna. At the base of the derrick is a buildinghousing the radar and the computer equipment that makes itdifferent from conventional systems.   NEXRAD _ costing millions as opposed to Huffman's $50,000 since1976 _ will differ by having built-in computer programs to comparedata with regional models and issue an automatic warning of tornadolikelihood.   But Huffman enjoys being able to interpret his data by himself.   ``They'll never completely replace the man in front of the radarscreen,'' agrees Weather Service severe storms specialist Al Mollerin Fort Worth. ``We have to strike a balance in technology,research and training of people responsible for issuing watches andwarnings.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for April 6</NOTE></DOC>
