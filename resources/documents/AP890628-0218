(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   ``That's one small step for a man,one giant leap for mankind.''   Twenty years have passed, nearly a generation, since NeilArmstrong called those momentous words down from the moon.   Two decades since Earthlings watched those flickering televisionimages, saw that tentative first step on the dusty surface andlooked on in wonder as two Americans hopped about in weak gravity,planted and saluted their flag, picked up bits of lunar treasure andspoke with their president a quarter million miles away.   Most people living then can tell you today where they were whenastronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took those first steps onthe moon Sunday, July 20, 1969.   They were realizing a goal that John F. Kennedy had set infrustration and desperation.   Kennedy came to office in January 1961 with a pledge to ``getthis country moving again.'' The economy was sluggish, Fidel Castrohad taken over Cuba, and the United States trailed the Soviets inthe highly visible arena of space.   The space chasm widened April 12, 1961, when Soviet cosmonautYuri A. Gagarin blasted into orbit, the first man to fly in space.   American prestige was rocked again five days later. On April 17,a brigade of Cuban exiles, sponsored by the Central IntelligenceAgency, stormed the beach at Cuba's Bay of Pigs in an effort tooverthrow Castro. His forces routed the ill-equipped exiles, leavingthe United States and its young president in shame and disarray.   Kennedy accepted the blame and decided bold action was needed torestore America's honor. Space was the answer, he concluded, and hegave Vice President Lyndon Johnson the task of determining whatcould be done.   On April 28, the National Aeronautics and Space Council, whichJohnson chaired, submitted a preliminary report to the president.``The moon is a good target for us,'' it said.   Even as the president and his advisers were discussing moontrips, some in the administration were concerned about the firstU.S. man-in-space flight, now set for May 2. With everything goingwrong for the nation, the impact of a failure could be devastating.   But Kennedy let the launch date stand, and, on May 5, after athree-day weather delay, astronaut Alan Shepard rode a slenderRedstone rocket and a cramped Mercury capsule 115 miles up and 302miles down the Atlantic tracking range on a 15-minute suborbitalflight.   America heaved a sigh of relief. The Soviets were still ahead,but the United States was on the move.   On May 25, four months after taking office, Kennedy delivered aspecial State of the Union message on urgent national needs. Itcovered many subjects, from the economy to disarmament. It alsodealt with space.   ``I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving thegoal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the moon andreturning him safely to Earth. No single space project in thisperiod will be more impressive to mankind, or more important to thelong-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult orexpensive to accomplish.''   The project was called Apollo _ after the Greek archer-god, thegod of light and truth, bright-shining, far-shooting.   Christopher C. Kraft Jr., who would become flight operationsdirector for Apollo, was a NASA engineer working on the Mercuryproject.   ``I thought he had lost his mind,'' Kraft said of Kennedy and hisbold commitment. ``We had a total of 15 minutes of mannedspaceflight experience, we hadn't flown Mercury in orbit yet, andhere's a guy telling me we're going to fly to the moon. ... Doing itwas one thing, but doing it in this decade was to me too risky.''   Despite the doubts of Kraft and others within NASA, America'sbiggest, costliest and most ambitious technological effort beganwith virtually no dissent. Before it was achieved, more than 20,000industrial contractors and 420,000 technicians, engineers and otherskilled persons would be involved.   While the hardware of Apollo was being developed and tested,Americans and Russians were learning to live and work in space andto perfect the rockets, spaceships and techniques for going to themoon.   To a watching world, it was like a relay race in space. TheRussians, with their larger booster rockets and larger mannedspacecraft, held the early lead.   John Glenn in 1962 was hailed as America's first orbitalchampion. Three more Mercury orbital flights proved man couldsurvive and function for at least a short time in weightless space.   NASA moved on in 1965 to the two-man Gemini program, and 10exciting flights in 20 months tested and proved all the rendezvousand docking and space walking procedures needed to travel to themoon.   The Russians, too, were perfecting these techniques. But by early1967, as the United States was ready to move into manned Apolloflights, America seemed to have a slight lead, based on superiorcomputer and other technologies.   Then, tragedy.   In a countdown test on Jan. 27, 1967, a month before the plannedlaunch, faulty wiring released a spark that touched off an infernoinside the Apollo 1 cabin. The flames, intensified by the 100percent oxygen environment, incinerated the three-man crew, GusGrissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee.   Three months after the Apollo fire, cosmonaut Vladimir Komarovrode into orbit in a new spacecraft named Soyuz, believed to be atest model for a lunar command ship. After a day in orbit, as hereturned to Earth, Soyuz 1 tumbled, became tangled in its parachutestraps and crashed. Komarov became the world's first in-flight spacecasualty.   In both countries, critics brought their guns to bear on bothspace programs. Each was halted for nearly two years while repairswere made.   Apollo was reexamined, rewired, redesigned and finally flew.Apollo 7 orbited the Earth for 11 days in October 1968, and then, ina bold move, NASA officials decided to fly the three-man Apollo 8crew into orbit about the moon on Christmas Eve 1968.   They reasoned the flight would provide vital information aboutnavigating to and around the moon, buy time while the lagging lunarlanding module was readied, and rob the Soviets of any glory theymight reap by looping one man once around the backside of the moonon a translunar trajectory; there was a widely reported rumor thatthe Soviets were ready to do just that.   The mission was a huge, uplifting success, and two more flights,one in which two astronauts swooped to within 10 miles of the lunarsurface, set the stage for the main event, Apollo 11.   More than 1 million people _ tourists, congressmen, diplomats,business people, reporters and movie stars _ came to watch thelaunch at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969. All eyes staredat the sheet of flame as the mighty Saturn 5 rose ponderously fromLaunch Pad 39A, precisely on schedule at 9:32 a.m., and sent athunderclap across the scrubland.   In the spaceship on the tip of the rocket were Neil AldenArmstrong, 38, a civilian, the commander; Air Force Col. EdwinEugene Aldrin Jr., 39, the lunar module pilot, and Air Force Lt.Col. Michael Collins, 38, the command module pilot _ ambassadorsfrom planet Earth headed for a target 250,801 miles away.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
