The 1986 Tax Reform Act requires companies next year to start proving that health and insurance programs offered executives aren't any more generous than the benefits given other workers. Every variation of a company's benefit package will have to be tested, says Deborah Aiken of CPAs Deloitte Haskins andamp; Sells. For large companies, that could mean 1,500 plans. And the IRS isn't making the task any easier: It has yet to rule how the tests should be made.    The tests will cost &quot;an awful lot of money,&quot; contends Samuel Murray of CPAs Arthur Andersen. Most employers don't have the systems or data for making the assessment, agrees Richard Johnson of consultant Mercer-Meidinger-Hansen. &quot;A surprising number of employers are not going to pass,&quot; he adds. Failing would require executives to pay income tax on the value of the extra benefits received.    Faced with the tests, companies &quot;will cut back on benefits,&quot; Mercer Meidinger's Henry Eickelberg predicts.    EXECUTIVES INSTALL high-tech equipment in houses to ease take-home chores.    Bert Roberts Jr., president of MCI Communications Corp., has two computers, three telephone lines and a copying machine to handle the work he brings home at night and on weekends. The modem-equipped PCs provide &quot;a convenient way to stay in touch with management and get into data bases,&quot; he explains. Steven Cook, executive vice president, finance, of American Capital Corp., has four PCs. Now he's thinking of putting in a facsimile machine.    Barry Wessler, president of DHL World Wide Express's NetExpress unit, says his home computer enables him to send messages to Japan at night and have answers waiting for him when he gets to work in the morning. But Robert Price, chief executive of Price Communications Corp., settles for a dictating machine that produces a tape he can carry to the office. Peter Carney, a Harris Corp. vice president, is content with a pencil and pad.    ECONOMIC SHIFTS will bring broad changes in the way we work.    But it's up to us whether we'll welcome what evolves, says a report from the Office of Technology Assessment, a congressional arm. The study says distinctions are fuzzing between manufacturing and service. What's coming instead are organizations built on tight networks of activities combining the old regimes. And therein lies the choice, says Henry Kelly, the project director.    Will companies assume, as some do now, that most workers can fill only narrowly defined roles? If so, he says, we're facing a stagnant economy where only trained elite will benefit while other workers will be used as needed and then displaced. A far brighter scenario comes, he says, when business plans on responsive workers and pushes the training required for continuous learning and growth.    Asks the report: Will change come at the expense of workers or will workers themselves be encouraged to change?    MERIT RAISES for senior executives are averaging 5.2% this year, up from 5% in 1987, consultant Towers Perrin figures. But increases for other salaried employees are holding steady at 4.9%. Workers covered by federal wage-and-hour legislation are getting 4.8% boosts, up from 4.7% last year.    WORKER COMPLAINTS: Lawsuits under statutes protecting employment rights now account for the largest single group of civil filings in federal courts, Research Institute of America says.    UNION MEMBERSHIP in manufacturing industries slipped 2.7% last year from 1986, while total manufacturing employment was little changed, according to a survey by CPAs Grant Thornton. In 1987, 25.8% of all manufacturing workers were unionized, off from 26.3% in 1986 and 28.9% in 1983.    TOILERS ALL are we. Most chief financial officers interviewed by Heidrick andamp; Struggles, a search firm, believe hard work got them where they are, more than leadership, people skills or intelligence. Timing, luck and educational credentials ranked far down on the list.    EVEN MANAGERS occasionally consider chucking it all.    Phillip Vitali, executive vice president of MGI Properties, says that &quot;boredom with the routines of life&quot; sometimes prompts him to dream of a trip to Europe or buying a Key West hotel. Phyllis Swersky, executive vice president of AICorp., says she was ready to call a halt six weeks ago when day-care arrangements for her three children suddenly collapsed. Steven Fingerhood, an investment banker, fantasizes about becoming a Zen master in Hawaii to get to &quot;the real meaning of life.&quot;    Peter Scott did call it quits 25 years ago. He left a promising career at Dresser Industries and sold most of his possessions to spend two years aboard a boat with his family in the Florida Keys. &quot;It's hard to explain how good it was,&quot; he recalls. Now he's chief executive of Emhart Corp.    Because of his break, Mr. Scott says he isn't afraid of retiring from his current job a couple of years from now.    THE CHECKOFF: Who cares about pay? CarnegieMellon's M.B.A. graduates list salary as ninth in their list of job demands, behind such factors as &quot;comfort&quot; and a good location. . . . But almost 200 grads of Duke's Fuqua School of Business expect to earn enough over the next three years to give $500 to their school. </TEXT></DOC>
