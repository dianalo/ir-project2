His only formal training remotely related to show businesswas clarinet lessons in the fourth grade. Though he did placesecond in the Latrobe, Pa., Lions Club talent show forsinging &quot;Just Friends,&quot; a song he wrote a few years back, healways figured he would make his living as a carpenter.</LP><TEXT>   Now, at 26, he is a star -- in a very minor galaxy.   People stop him in stores and ask, &quot;Aren't you SheriffJackson?&quot; Why yes, he is. He is the guy who several times aday, six days a week, gets shot in the rear end, yelps andthen chases down the bad guy in a regular Wild West skit atIdlewild Park in Ligonier, Pa. Between gunfights, he croons&quot;Rocky Top&quot; and strums his guitar.   &quot;I'm hanging around Idlewild, hoping someone will discoverme,&quot; says Mr. Shirey, who has been the sheriff at Idlewild'sHootin' Holler for eight years.   There are a passel of talented young people, with similardreams, all over the country. They spend their summers inplaces such as Indiana's Santa Claus Land, belting out songson stages no bigger than a baseball dugout, for audiencesthat didn't come to see them but to ride the roller coaster.For performers, it is theatrical experience, a foot in thedoor. Many hope to end up on Broadway, in Hollywood, or atleast in Anaheim, Calif. Disneyland is a plum job.   The competition is fierce. Representatives of amusementparks, theme parks and the Norwegian Cruise Lines for thepast month or so have been hopping from Muncie, Ind., toTulsa, Okla., and even to New York City, auditioningpotential Berenstain Bears and Lusty Lils for the comingsummer. More than 500 hopefuls show up at the typicalaudition. Disney tends to draw crew-neck sweaters, ponytailsand more dimples than in a mile of cellulite. Nashville'sOpryland attracts big hair. Cruise ships draw red lips.   Most who turn out are college students majoring in theateror dance, who arrive with portfolios of publicity stillsunder their arms. Other aspirants are straight out of thechurch choir or have appeared locally somewhere in &quot;SouthPacific.&quot;   &quot;For some, an amusement park is the equivalent of hittingBroadway,&quot; says Charles Stephens, chairman of the musicdepartment at St. Clair County Community College, whichplayed host to auditions in tiny Port Huron, Mich., for CedarPoint Park in Sandusky, Ohio.   Being an amusement-park entertainer is like being vicepresident; people are more interested in the main attraction-- like being dropped 200 feet in three seconds and eatingfried dough. Patrons will stop in for a little song and dancebecause the theater is air-conditioned or the pool is closed,or because the line for the Blue Streak is too long.   &quot;This is not Shakespeare Theater where people sit quietlyand applaud. You need to reach out to them,&quot; says MarjeCronenewett, manager of park attractions for Cedar Point.Singers at Kennywood Park in Pittsburgh had to outsing thescreams from a black octopus ride named the MonongahelaMonster, which flailed above the outdoor stage. This year thepark decided to drop its &quot;Raz Ma Taz&quot; song show, and replaceit with the Rocket Car: A stunt man rides a little car down achute, flips in the air and comes down on a landing pad, or(occasionally) in the nearby lagoon. Another fellow swallowsswords and fire four times a day. That, too, requires talent.   But for 22-year-old Kristi Smith, the years of voicelessons and braces on her teeth were worth it, just for a gigat Geauga Lake Park in Aurora, Ohio. There, she got to singand dance in a grueling 30-minute show, repeated 36 times aweek and requiring six costume changes, made possible byVelcro. The stuff, she adds, loses zip after 250performances. Once her dress popped open and she had to backoff stage.   Ms. Smith's parents had wanted her to play the oboe, buther woodwind career got sidetracked in the eighth grade, whenshe was picked to make a TV appearance with Pearl Bailey. Hertwo-minute, three-line debut earned her $2,000. &quot;I thought`Wow, this is it.' I don't want to be sitting in an orchestrain 20 years playing an oboe. I want to be on stage.&quot; So shetook her two grand to the orthodontist and got her teethstraightened. &quot;I'm glad I did it. People say I have lovelyteeth,&quot; she says. This summer, she is going to Opryland tosing George M. Cohan songs.   Opryland, like Disneyland and Walt Disney World, isconsidered a great job. They pay twice what some smallerparks pay -- as much as $500 a week. And the big parks havethe most lavish shows. One of them, Kings Island, inCincinnati, has an underwater scene with twinklingfiber-optic lights and mermaids who dress like Cher. The bigparks, like Disney's, often lip sync voices, so the performerwho moves like a swan but sings like a duck can still be astar.   At smaller parks, performers have to sing, dance and mendcostumes. (Mr. Shirey's mother mends his sheriff's uniform.)&quot;We're small potatoes,&quot; says Annie Hughes, whose 70-year-oldhusband, Carl, runs Kennywood and Idlewild and books all theentertainment, including a bird comedy routine called AlphieCockatoo and the Comedy MaCaws. There aren't many LasVegas-type, multisequined reviews at smaller parks.   But small parks can be stepping-stones to bigger things.One Cedar Point performer went to Broadway with &quot;Annie,&quot;another is touring with Natalie Cole. Debbie Damp, ofLatrobe, Pa., who played Royal Wife No. 7 in &quot;The King and I&quot;in summer stock and spent three summers at Idlewild, was aDisney finalist this year.   Ms. Damp has been dreaming of working for Disney eversince the third grade, when one of the Seven Dwarfs in theCrickett Theater's production of Snow White got chicken pox.Overnight, she was elevated from a lowly tree to Doc. MissJones, her teacher, told the audience little Debbie had savedthe show.   Smitten, she took tap-dancing and starred in high-schoolplays. But her big break was with Idlewild in 1988. Sheplayed Ma McCoy, and got hit in the face with cream pies. Herparents turned out every Sunday to see the show.   Now, she hopes, her career is taking off. Aside from beinga Disney finalist who didn't make the final cut, she landed aTV commercial for Arthur Treacher's Fish andamp; Chips and a radiocommercial for Highway Pizza, in State College, Pa. Next: thebig screen? Ms. Damp may soon be telling Cinema World theateraudiences: &quot;No smoking, no big hats.&quot;   While amusement-park performers may be aiming for theGreat White Way or the Hollywood Walk of Fame, most willnever get much further than singing &quot;Bile Them Cabbage Down&quot;next to a cotton candy stand. &quot;This will be the pinnacle,&quot;says Joseph McGoldrick, assistant performing arts director atPoint Park College in Pittsburgh, where amusement parks dosome of their hiring.   Mr. Shirey, alias Sheriff Jackson, now works winters as asecurity guard at Idlewild, and between summer shows hasoperated the Rollocoaster and Spider rides. But he lives forthe stage.   Last summer, Mr. Shirey decided that, after eight years,he needed to jazz up his routine. He stood in the wings untilthe other performers were on stage, ran out, jumped in theair and touched his toes, like a member of the Bolshoi.Dazzled by his agility, the audience gave him a standingovation, which a friend of his captured on videotape.   &quot;It was my moment in the spotlight,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
