Swimming never has been allowed at Anderson.;    Parks and recreationofficials had estimated in May, when Anderson was opened for water sports,that there would be enough water for boating, water-skiing and windsurfingthrough August.;    The Santa Clara Valley Water District leases the lake tothe county for recreation, but releases water regularly as part of its primarymission -- groundwater recharge.;    &quot;They knew what our (water) releaseschedule called for. We have to put water into the ground basin,&quot; waterdistrict spokeswoman Teddy Morse said.;    As of Thursday, there were 21,748acre-feet of water in Anderson. After the unexpectedly heavy rains in March,the reservoir, which has a capacity of almost 90,000 acre-feet, held 26,500acre-feet.;    An acre-foot is the amount of water a family of five uses inone year.;    With the closing of Anderson, power-boat owners and water-skiersare limited to Calero Reservoir, located off McKean Road south of San Jose.Non-power boats are allowed on Uvas, Chesbro, Lexington and Stevens Creekreservoirs and Vasona Lake.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DALE RODEBAUGH, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  South County  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910802  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  318  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday August 2, 199100215246,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
