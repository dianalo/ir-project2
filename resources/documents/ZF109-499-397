they only phone when something I ordered has arrived;they deliver; and they take personal checks without looking at my driver'slicense or demanding my social security number.andM;Of course as a non-computerized store they don't take credit cards, but theywill open a credit line in about ten seconds if they already know you, so Ido business with them in preference to any other store of any size, even whenit is slightly less convenient to do so.andM;It just goes to show what personal service can still do, and their pricesaren't that different from big impersonal stores in large cities because whatpersonal service costs them in time is more than compensated for by theirmuch lower overhead.andM;Small-town life has many good points to make up for the lack of a movietheatre and the fact that the closest library is mostly known as the home ofa weather-forecasting rodent known worldwide as Punxsutawney Phil.andP;  Thislibrary once had an IBM-PCjr available for patron's use, but even that awfulsystem has finally disappeared.andM;It is possible to strike a balance between too much computerization whichseems to inevitably lead to poor customer service in the retail industry(although it is vital to good customer service elsewhere - as in theinsurance and banking fields), and too little as found in the library where acrippled computer plays second fiddle to a rodent.andM;I would like to encourage Rainey's to add a computer system to handle theiraccounting because I think it would be a big help to them but am afraid to doso because once they get it they might catch the information hunger diseasethat has all Radio Shack stores asking for your phone number when you try tobuy a 30-cent connector.andM;You would think that since Radio Shack is highly computerized it would beeasy to order something that isn't in stock, while getting odd items from arural general store would be a real problem, but just the opposite is thecase.andP;  It is a waste of time to ask for something that you don't see on theshelf at the local Radio Shack.andM;First, the clerk won't know what you are talking about and have to get themanager, who isn't even familiar with the contents of his store's owncatalog.andP;  Next comes a trip back to the same place you have already lookedfor the item and then he will tell you how he once heard about something likethat but doesn't have one and can't get one.andP;  If you point out that youbought one in his store last week, he will usually say that they don't makeit any more.andP;  Sometimes the clerk or manager uses a computer but only tocheck current inventory, not to place an order.andM;Contrast that with the non-computerized General Store.andP;  I usually look aroundfor what I need, and although parts of the store are pretty dark unless theyhave thought to turn on the lights in the paint department that day, I oftenfind what I need.andP;  Failing in that search, I ask an owner or clerk and theycan almost always tell me immediately if they have such a thing, even withoutlooking.andM;Although Rainey's does a great job without it, it is possible to balancetechnology.andP;  In our home office we try to answer our phone quickly andwithout resorting to the answering machine during business hours (althoughhome and business lines are necessarily on the answering machine all the restof the time); we use two large dogs for most security rather than invest inthe latest security devices (although we do use TV cameras); we put stamps onenvelopes rather than use a mail meter; and we seldom resort to the excusethat &quot;the computer ate our work&quot; (even though it occasionally does).andM;We even hid our satellite dish up in a large tree which is branching outnicely to hide the dish and we don't own a microwave oven, although we do ownthousands of books.andP;  We try to balance our technologically advanced businesswith the fact that we chop firewood with an axe rather than buy a logsplitter and hope that others don't get caught up in the idea that, justbecause computers can do some things exceptionally well, they should rule ourentire lives.andM;Our summer worker started to tell me one day that it would be much easier tocut down some trees with a chainsaw than the axe I had handed him but quicklychanged his tune when I pointed out that If I bought a $300 tool to cut treesI could do it myself and he would be out of a job.andM;I could also invest in gadgets that would eliminate much of the paperwork westill do here and could use optical character recognition rather than hire alocal typist, but the work wouldn't get done any better or cheaper; I wouldjust take the work from a person who needs the money and give it to amachine.andM;When deciding to computerize any activity it is important to make certainthat the jump to technology is really cost-effective in the long run.andP;  Oftenit is, but not always.andM;(John McCormick/19900829)</TEXT></DOC>
