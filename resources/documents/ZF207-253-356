(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Micro Network Operating SystemsandM;Today's market makes it possible and sometimes even advisable to mix localarea network adapter cards and operating systems from different vendors.andP;  Thesecret of your success lies in making sure both products meet networkprotocol standards exactly.andM;Although many vendors supply network cards and accompanying operating systemsoftware, only a few sell their operating systems unbundled from the hardwareor sell software only.andM;One traditionally popular combination has been Novell Inc. NetWare with someother vendor's adapter cards.andP;  This came about because network usersconsidered Novell's network operating software superior.andP;  Novell also sellscomplete LAN systems.andM;Other vendors have begun offering network operating software tht runs withany standard adapter card.andP;  If both parts are designed for a definiteprotocol standard, users should encounter little difficulty.andM;However, one problem may arise with unbundled network software.andP;  Manycompanies that claim to sell unbundled, hardware-independent networkoperating software are in fact reselling someone else's product, most likelyNovell's NetWare or Advanced NetWare.andM;Anyone who buys NetWare from a third-party vendor should make sure thatsignificant value has been added for the extra markup.andP;  The software aloneusually is cheaper if purchased directly from Novell.andM;Of course, there is much more to defining LAN software requirements thansimply selecting an operating system vendor who makes an implementation ofEthernet.andM;Most stand-alone operating systems have other features, such as advancedsecurity, electronic mail, interconnectability with other LAN operatingenvironments or bridging to wide area networks (WANs) and gateways.andP;  It isthese extras that make a particular network software package attractive.andM;Niche SoftwareandM;While most suppliers of unbundled, hardware-independent LAN operating systemsalso make network adapter cards, the software usually functions in aparticular niche.andM;For example, DSC Communications Corp., Campbell, Calif., makes a number ofhardware and software solutions for Ethernet, token-ring and Arcnet networks.andO;DSC's NEXOS network operating software sports several additions forlargescale database work or remote LAN connections.andM;It includes an integrated database engine that works with the DataFlexdatabase to provide database server capability.andP;  That makes it possible fornetwork database functions to take place at the server under instructionsfrom the workstation, improving efficiency.andM;Another enhancement of the NEXOS software is remote interconnection with IBMCorp.'s Systems Network Architecture, 5250 protocol, X.25, TCP/IP orasynchronous communications.andP;  Although other add-in products are required totake advantage of these features, the common operating system does ensuresoftware compatibility and greatly simplifies interconnection.andM;Waterloo Microsystems, Norcross, Ga., took another approach to adding valuewith its recently announced Port Lite entry-level peer-to-peer network.andO;Designed to support ARCnet or token-ring hardware, Port Lite is limited tofive workstations and can address up to 15 printers.andP;  Each workstation canshare the printers or fixed drives.andM;Port Lite supports internetworking with other Port networks, E-mail andremote workstations.andP;  Its uniqueness lies in its icon interface, whichsimplifies operation for novice users.andM;Each user has an &quot;office&quot; with icons representing that user's programs orapplications.andP;  The user simply tabs to the appropriate icon and pressesEnter.andP;  The application runs, returning to the office when the session isfinished.andP;  Help screens can be added to user icons.andM;A similar interface is presented on Tapestry II LAN Manager from TorusSystems Inc., Redwood City, Calif.andP;  The Torus icons use a metaphor of filecabinets instead of offices.andP;  Users access their applications and files byopening drawers in the appropriate file cabinet.andP;  Tapestry must run in OS/2under Microsoft Corp.'s LAN Manager and actually is a custom front end forLAN Manager.andM;Excelan Inc., a San Jose, Calif., supplier of both bundled and unbundlednetwork products, calls its series of operating systems and drivers LANWorkPlace for PC-DOS.andP;  Although Excelan software runs in an Ethernetenvironment, drivers are available to interface to Novell's NetWare 2.1workstations, servers and internetwork bridges.andP;  Excelen also makes softwareproducts for connection to dissimilar networks and TCP/IP, the DefenseDepartment standard communications protocol.andM;Recently, D-Link Systems (formally Localnet Communications) of Costa Mesa,Calif., introduced the ARCnet-compatible LANsmart Release 2.0.andP;  LANsmartboasts several entry-level features including disk caching, five levels ofsecurity, print-queue management and chat functions.andP;  The new productoptionally provides remote booting for diskless workstations, an asynchronouscommunications server, software bridge and E-mail.andM;One of LANsmart's most useful features for large, memory-hungry applicationsis its ability to load as a terminate-and-stay-resident program occupying aslittle as 10K of RAM.andP;  It does so by removing part of itself from memory whennecessary and reconnecting on demand, after the large application hasfinished running.andM;Database ServersandM;A favorite buzz phrase today is &quot;database server,&quot; which refers to a networkserver containing both databases and the engine to run a networked databaseapplication.andP;  Although the application runs at the workstation, datamanipulation takes place back at the file server under direction from theworkstation application.andM;Univation Inc., the Milpitas, Calif., supplier of the LifeNet networkoperating system, adds value to its software by joining forces with suchdatabase developers as WordTech Systems Inc., Orinda, Calif., and DataAccessCorp., Miami, which sells DataFlex.andP;  These joint efforts have resulted indatabase server versions of DataFlex and the dBase compiler, Quicksilver.andM;Univation has said that execution times are significantly faster fordatabases running with the LifeNet database server versions than without.andO;Also, Univation has claimed that data integrity improves significantly withthe database server versions.andM;Several LAN suppliers offer a smorgasbord of connectivity solutions,including LAN software and hardware, communications products, internetworkingproducts, bridges and gateways.andM;Among the most successful are the communications company DigitalCommunications Associates Inc., Alpharetta, Ga., and its networkingsubsidiary, 10Net Communications, Dayton, Ohio.andP;  The two companies covervirtually all local and wide area networking issues with industry-standardsoftware and hardware.andM;Although 10Net Plus LAN software traditionally has been used with thecompany's hardware, it announced last year that it was unbundling thepeer-to-peer operating system for IBM Token-Ring and PC Network cards.andO;Because 10Net Plus adheres closely to the NetBIOS standard, it meets thecriteria of being both unbundled and hardware-independent.andM;10Net recently announced a version for Ethernet LANs.andP;  According to a companyrepresentative, interconnection now is possible to dissimilar LANs,mainframes, wide area networks, UNIX (using TCP/IP) and AppleTalk.andM;Still another approach was taken by network giants 3Com Corp. and Novell.andO;Without providing a complete set of network drivers and interfaces for variedenvironments, both companies nevertheless make a strong set of bridges.andP;  Theycan achieve the same level of connectivity, but often need extra productsfrom other vendors.andM;However, the entry of 3Com and Novell into the OS/3 LAN Manager arena maychange all that.andP;  Officials of both companies have said they expect to makecomplete solutions available within the context of LAN Manager.andM;Novell Needs InterfacesandM;While 3Com of Santa Clara, Calif., has implemented its LAN Manager strategyunder OS/2, Novell cannot simply interconnect with MS-DOS or OS/2 NetBIOSsystems because it uses its own network operating system.andP;  The company hashad to build interfaces to support the IBM standard.andP;  For users of OS/2, theproduct is called the NetWare Requester for OS/2.andM;For OS/2 server-based internal applications, Novell offers a non-dedicatedNetWare.andP;  Additional power can by supplied by the application coprocessorboard.andP;  External applications simply run on an applications server on thenetwork.andP;  DOS and OS/2 workstations can be mixed, as with most OS/2 networks.andM;To understand the potential impact of Microsoft's LAN Manager, it is helpfulto review some basics of network operating system architecture.andM;A standard network and server installation is composed of servers andworkstations known as clients.andP;  The server manages the files that clients useand acts as a network traffic cop, communicating between clients and theserver, clients and other clients, and clients and other servers.andM;The workstations can be dumb terminals, diskless PCs, PCs, XTs, ATs or PS/2s.andO;A special network adapter card must reside in client computers forcommunication with the network.andM;Software running on the servers and workstations has several purposes.andP;  Theoperating system software, such as MS-DOS, PC-DOS or OS/2, is the same as ifeach computer were dedicated to a single user.andP;  However, the network softwaremust perform special tasks associated with the LAN.andM;Some of those tasks include communicating between user and network,identifying the user to the network, accessing network services, accessingprinters and network drives or other servers, and accessing outside servicessuch as gateways and bridges.andM;The standard network definition divides those tasks and the means by whichthey are accomplished into broad categories called layers.andP;  The layers accessvarious areas of the network operating software through predefined hooks.andO;Each layer's purpose is defined carefully, as is the nature of any externalaccess to that layer.andM;For each layer that permits external access, the standard definitionprescribes exactly how external programs must communicate.andP;  When a clientworkstation, for example, wants to communicate with another client on thenetwork, the network software residing at the workstation encodes thatrequest into an application protocol.andM;There are several of these protocols, depending on the network software, butthe one used by LAN Manager is known as the server message block (SMB).andP;  SMBsare specially constructed communications messages containing a request andits routing instructions.andM;Once an SMB is created at the application layer, it needs to be sent.andP;  It istransferred to the transport layer, where connection between the two clientsis established according to the encoded instructions.andM;However, in basic operating systems like MS-DOS, ones that were not designedspecifically for networking and multitasking, the resources available may belimited.andP;  Network performance can degrade with big applications or largenumbers of users.andM;LAN Manager was designed in an attempt to foresee the kinds of networkingenvironments that will evolve.andP;  Although it does not require OS/2, LANManager is a superior engine for controlling and enhancing networkperformance at both the server and the workstation.andM;It makes it greatest performance gains under OS/2.andM;Several developers of network software have decided that their own frontends, combined with the LAN Manager engine, make viable network operatingsoftware products.andP;  Some of this interest in LAN Manager comes from theperceived benefits of OS/2.andP;  The most dramatic is LAN Manager's multitaskingcapability.andM;Based on the OS/2 concept of named pipes, LAN Manager allows concurrentread-write operations so that several client requests can be processedsimultaneously.andM;A second major benefits is OS/2's memory management ability.andP;  Not only willit support up to 16M of physical memory, it also will support a large virtualmemory for memory-sharing so that multiple applications can runsimultaneously.andM;One of the most important benefits for potential LAN Manager users, however,remains relatively hidden.andP;  LAN Manager has a standard application programinterface (API), which provides a consistent basis for network applicationdevelopment.andP;  Because the API extends across the network, developers cancreate true distirbuted applications to take advantage of the processingpower at the servers.andM;Lightening the LoadandM;Like many distributed database applications, LAN Manager applications candivide the work between clients and servers, lightening the load on thenetwork and reducing performance bottlenecks.andM;LAN Manager network software consists of server software and workstationsoftware.andP;  The server generally runs under OS/2 and the network managementsoftware consists of a suite of applications and drivers that address theapplications level of OS/2.andP;  The workstation may run either OS/2 or MS-DOS,although performance under the latter will be less efficient.andM;When it becomes necessary for one network to communicate with another,dissimilar protocols often present difficulties.andP;  If an Ethernet LAN, forexample, needs to communicate with a token-ring LAN, there are a number ofways to do it, ranging from network bridges to communicatins gateways.andM;These gateways and bridges are physical devices, usually consisting ofdedicated hardware and software.andP;  The software acts as a translator betweenthe two dissimilar network protocols while the hardware provides a platformfor interconnecting the two networks.andM;One of LAN Manager's major benefits is its ability to dispense with thesephysical interfaces, translating dynamically between the transport protocols.andO;That saves money on network devices and bridges and frees up networkresources.andM;Even when a gateway or bridge is necessary, such as a TCP/IP gateway betweenan Ethernet LAN and a UNIX network, LAN Manager can switch between protocolsefficiently.andM;LAN Manager has gained rapid acceptance among network vendors, with some 29different suppliers having announced plans to license LAN Manager for theirproducts.andM;The advent of LAN Manager also has opened doors for real connectivity betweendifferent hardware and software platforms in networks of micros, minis andmainframes running MS-DOS, OS/2, Macintosh, UNIX, VMS, VM or other operatingsystems.andM;Internetworking NeededandM;Application software vendors have begun to recognize the potential forconnectivity among these diverse computing environments and are developingversions of their products to run on different operating systems andplatforms.andP;  All that remains to be developed is a method of internetworkingthat can exploit this new breed of application software.andM;Network software has been advancing more dramatically than hardware, and itdoes appear that most of those advances will be built around LAN Manager.andO;While companies such as 10Net concentrate on total connectivity by expandingtheir existing line of LAN, WAN and connectivity offerings, other vendorslike 3Com Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. are establishing strategic alliancesfor direct connection to other platforms through LAN Manager.andM;Using 3Com's 3+Open implementation of LAN Manager, the two companies havedevised a connectivity blueprint for an organizationwide network consistingof MS-DOS PCs, OS/2 PCs, Macintoshes, UNIX workstations, IBM MVS mainframes,Digital Equipment Corp. VAX minicomputers, Hewlett-Packard 3000 and 9000comuters and 3Com 3+Open servers.andM;Some companies are carving out niches within the broader scope ofinternetwork connectivity.andP;  These smaller companies concentrate on gateways,bridges, sub-LANs and connectivity to optical storage devices.andM;A few companies such as Novell, which can build on its strong marketpresence, continue developing solutions based on proprietary networkoperating systems.andP;  Sometimes that is more difficult, but a large existinguser base is a powerful incentive to take the extra trouble to providecompatibility across dissimilar and non-standard architectures.andM;Users who want to plan for internetworking should adhere to standards,especially in their network operating software.andP;  Taking care of this areaalmost always results in smoother installation and operation.andP;  Staying closeto a single vendor, where possible, helps ensure adherence to standards withconsistency across a variety of connectivity products.andM;If software will come from a vendor other than the one that sold thehardware, the software definitely shold be hardware-independent in additionto adhering to standards.andP;  If operating software has been unbundled fromadapter cards, it may not run with any other vendor's boards.andP;  Buyers shouldavoid exotic solutions to simple problems; straightforward interconnectionproducts usually are available.andM;Although mixing software and hardware vendors certainly is possible, the bestway to avoid being trapped by non-standard software is to choose a vendorthat can supply both the hardware and the software.andP;  Most software vendorsand virtually all hardware vendors can supply both.andM;Most of the other issues surrounding the establishment or expansion of alocal area network come back to the selection of the network operatingsystem.andP;  If requirements are examined and solutions evaluated before thevendor is selected, the buyer can avoid most of the tribulations that lurkbehind every network installation.andM;Connectivity finally has begun to come into its own.andP;  The most dramatic proofis the proliferation of innovative answers to the stubborn problem of sharinginformation regardless of where it resides.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
