Among those named in the suit is Donald Coleman, a formerchief financial officer for Washington Bancorp. who is nowvice president in charge of the loan-servicing division forthe Student Loan Marketing Association.

Thomas Fleming III, formerpresident of National Bank of Washington, WashingtonBancorp.'s now-defunct banking subsidiary; and ThelmaElizabeth Pollard, a former commercial paper salesman forWashington Bancorp. Without admitting any wrongdoing, Ms.Pollard also agreed not to violate securities laws in thefuture.   An attorney for Mr. Fleming said his client wasn'tinvolved in Washington Bancorp.'s commercial paper programand said Mr. Fleming intends to fight the SEC charges.   The SEC said Washington Bancorp. continued to issuecommercial paper, or short-term IOUs, in early 1990, eventhough the company didn't have enough capital or borrowingability to repay the obligations. In May 1990, WashingtonBancorp. announced that it wouldn't be able to repay about$36.7 million of unsecured commercial paper obligationsbecause some of its credit lines had been cut off.   The SEC alleged that Messrs. Coleman and Fleming violatedsecurities laws by failing to disclose in WashingtonBancorp.'s financial statements that the company couldn'trepay its commercial paper obligations. In addition, the SECsaid, Mr. Coleman assisted in preparing Washington Bancorp.'s1989 year-end filing, which falsely stated that the companyhad $35 million in backup lines of credit to support thecommercial paper.   The SEC said Ms. Pollard &quot;broke,&quot; or matured prematurely,bank customers' time deposits, including insured certificatesof deposit, and invested the money in the commercial paperwithout the customers' permission.   In conjunction with the SEC action, the Federal ReserveBoard filed a consent decree against Mr. Coleman thatrequires him to notify the Fed before accepting any positionwith a bank or other federally insured depositoryinstitution.   Edward Leahy, an attorney for Mr. Coleman, said theactions by the SEC and Federal Reserve Board decree won'taffect Mr. Coleman's position at Sallie Mae. He said Mr.Coleman &quot;decided to put this entire matter behind him and geton with his professional career.&quot;   An attorney for Ms. Pollard said she settled the SECaction &quot;to try to resolve this matter and get it behind her.&quot;   Washington Bancorp.'s commercial paper default prompted araft of lawsuits from depositors, including one filed byNational Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. The company filedfor protection from its creditors under federal bankruptcylaw in August 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
