The government had initially put the drop at 1.7 percent, butrevised it downward after deciding that the nation's economicoutput in the April-June period had been greater than previouslyestimated.   In another report, the Commerce Department said constructionspending jumped 1.2 percent in July as strength in governmentbuilding projects and offices and apartments offset declines insingle-family housing, factories and shopping centers.   Productivity is a measure of the number of hours of laborrequired to achieve a certain output of goods and services. In theperiod, employees' hours rose 6.6 percent, greater than the 5.2percent increase in output.   Analysts said the increase in hours and conseqent decrease inproductivity reflects a hiring boom in which employers are havingto compete for less-skilled workers because of decade-lowunemployment.   Measured in dollars, U.S. factories have outperformed the restof the world in the past year in reducing labor costs, partlythrough the smallest wage increases of any industrial country lastyear.   On Wednesday, the Census Bureau said the proportion of blackAmericans living in poverty rose last year to nearly a third. Itsaid the overall poverty rate was fairly steady.   The report Wednesday said a survey based on a sample of 60,000families found that in the nation as a whole, incomes rose 1percent and the poverty rate edged down. The changes were notconsidered statistically significant because they fell within thesurvey's margin of possible error.   The poverty rate for blacks increased to 33.1 percent from 31.1percent in 1986, the study said, meaning the number of blacksliving in poverty rose from 8.9 million to 9.7 million.   ``The economic recovery is leaving many poor Americans behind,''said Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and PolicyPriorities, a private research group.   In the financial markets Wednesday, the stock market postedscattered losses. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finishedwith a 6.58-point loss at 2,031.65.   The dollar rose strongly, especially against the Japanese yen,while interest rates dipped in the bond market.   According to the Census Bureau report, median family income forblacks fell to $18,098 from $18,247, while the median income forwhite families rose to $32,274 from $31,935.   The poverty rate for whites dipped to 10.5 percent from 11percent. For Hispanics the poverty rate rose to 28.2 percent from27.3 percent.   The government defined the poverty income level as $11,611 for afamily of four in 1987, up from $11,203 the previous year.   William P. Butz, the Census Bureau's associate director fordemographic programs, said the nation's ``economic performance, interms of income and poverty, has been mixed'' as usual.   The number of Americans living in poverty last year totaled 32.5million, slightly higher than the 32.4 million reported for 1986.The poverty rate was 13.5 percent, down from 13.6 percent.   It is possible for the poverty rate to decline even when morepeople are poor because the size of the population is growingfaster than the number of people living in poverty.   The study found women's incomes continue to trail those of men.It said women receive about 65 percent of males' take-home pay, apercentage that has remained unchanged since 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
