The pesticide, if eventually approved, would be used against theEuropean corn borer.   Crop Genetics Inc. of Hanover, Md., applied to both EPA and theAgriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Serviceto test the new substance on its farm near Ingleside, Md., and atthe Agriculture Department's research station at Beltsville, Md.   The report by microbiologists and plant pathologists from thehazard evaluation divison of EPA's pesticides office said theproperties of the engineered organism and results of lab tests onmice ``indicate that there are no human health risks.''   The report said it is difficult to transfer the organism fromone plant to another except on the blades of cutting tools, and theengineered organism eventually should die out in competition withthe natural strain.   ``For this small-scale field test, providing all thecontainment, monitoring and contingency procedures are adhered to,we can foresee no risk to non-target insects and no effect onendangered species,'' and the organism may be used, the group said.   The report will be considered at a public meeting April 18 of asubcommittee of EPA's pesticide scientific advisory panel. Thepanel's report is expected in time for a decision on the permits inMay.</TEXT></DOC>
