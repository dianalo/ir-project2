<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-48-1111 </DOCNO><TEXT>Published experimental data on the temperature dependence of the magneticpenetration depth {lambda}(T) in YBa/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 9-/ /sub {delta}/by means of muon-spin-relaxation ({mu}SR) measurements are analysed interms of conventional (s-wave) weak- and strong-coupling theory. Thedata are consistent with very strong electron-phonon coupling. It isemphasized that the often used empirical formula [{lambda}(0)/{lambda}(T)]/sup2/=[1-(T/T/sub c/)/sup 4/] does not represent the weak-coupling magneticpenetration depth.</TEXT></DOC>
