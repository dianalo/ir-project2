Mr. Gorbachev is the first Sovietleader ever to visit Japan. The two countries are oldenemies. The start of friendly relations between them wouldmake history in the Far East and add a new unpredictable spinto the question of who will police the Asian Pacific. Becauseof a territorial dispute over four islands claimed by Japanbut occupied since 1945 by the Soviets, Moscow and Tokyo havenever signed a World War II peace treaty.   The big guessing game leading up to this week's talks hascentered on whether Mr. Gorbachev might chuck an island, ortwo, or four, in Japan's direction -- and just how much moneyJapan might agree to sink into the Soviet Union in return.The bigger the deal, the more likely it is to be hailed as asign of budding fraternity in the Far East. Japan's leadersare also still smarting over criticism that they didn'tmeasure up in the Gulf War. Hosting Mr. Gorbachev offers achance to impress Western critics with fancy diplomaticfootwork.</LP><TEXT>   What shines best at the circus, however, doesn't alwayswork out for the best in geopolitics. There is no good reasonnow for Japan to leap toward the Soviet Union. Mr. Gorbachevcomes to Tokyo as the leader of a flailing communistgovernment that is trying to straddle a fragmenting empire.Prime Minister Kaifu's wisest course would be listen towhatever Mr. Gorbachev has to say, perhaps nod sagely, andlet the world -- including Mr. Gorbachev -- wait awhile foran answer.   That may also be the easiest course. Neither PresidentGorbachev nor Prime Minister Kaifu is in a position to easilycut a deal on the islands, or on anything else of majorimportance -- such as new Soviet plans for Pacific trade ordefense.   Mr. Gorbachev's Soviet government is jostling at home withanother claimant to the islands -- the Russian Republic.Boris Yeltsin's administration maintains that the islands areRussian territories, not Soviet. It's a further sign of howunsteady the ground is under Mr. Gorbachev that the mavericklocal government of the Soviet Union's Sakhalin island hasalso demanded a say in the fate of the disputed islands. Instriking any deal with the Soviets, the Japanese would dowell to take into account the probable half-life of Mr.Gorbachev's ability, or inclination, to honor any promises hemakes.   The larger danger here has little to do with the disputedislands, but rather with the source of the antagonism theyrepresent. Japan, taking its cue from the U.S., might tooquickly abandon its wariness of the Soviets. The SovietPacific fleet at the moment looks like a lot of brawn withnot much guiding brain. But from the home port ofVladivostok, close to Japan, the Soviets through all Mr.Gorbachev's years of glasnost have continued to upgrade theirnaval power in the Pacific. They have made noises and somemotions toward decamping from the military bases at Vietnam'sDa Nang airfield and Cam Ranh Bay, and have damped theirrelations with the nut-case communist regime of North Korea.But so far there has been no movement that could not bereversed rapidly should a sudden change in the Sovietleadership produce a government again interested inadventures abroad.   On the Japanese side, it's also difficult -- though farless important -- to know who has the authority to deliverthe last word. Prime Minister Kaifu is by parliamentary voteof the Diet the elected leader. But Japan's ruling LiberalDemocratic Party has been traveling a bumpy passage towardtruly modern democracy in recent years, with politiciansstill ceding much power to the state bureaucracy butincurring the disapproval of voters in the process. Mr.Kaifu's efforts to seize the initiative by proposing indirectmilitary cooperation in the Gulf ended in embarrassingdefeat. And LDP high-level missions to Moscow certainly didnot impress Japanese voters enough to earn victory for theparty's candidate in Tokyo's April 7 gubernatorial election.Instead, the leader of those missions, Ichiro Ozawa, ended upresigning as LDP secretary-general -- taking responsibilityfor the election defeat. There is at the moment no workingmachinery in Tokyo for agile deal-making with Mr. Gorbachev.   So with Japan today at center stage, Mr. Kaifu couldprobably best take charge by being nothing much more thanpolite. Despite America's embrace of Mr. Gorbachev, this is amoment when Japan's greatest contribution to the new worldorder could be to take the old Asian tack of patience.</TEXT></DOC>
