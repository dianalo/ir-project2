In 1986, the Navy decided to develop a model blimp that could beused for radar surveillance, sparking feverish competition betweenthe Goodyear Aerospace Corp., a unit of the Goodyear Tire andRubber Co., and a joint venture of the Westinghouse Electric Corp.and Airship Industries, a British blimp maker.   The two military contractors envisioned a potential $5 billionproject involving 48 airships, the Times said.   The competition is now a subject of the FBI inquiry into allegedPentagon bribery and fraud in awarding military contracts,according to present and former executives of the companies,federal investigators and others familiar with the case.   It also is being examined by a separate SEC investigationlooking at whether information leaks from the Navy affected tradingin the stock of Airship Industries, the executives andinvestigators told the Times.   The $168.9 million airship prototype contract was awarded toWestinghouse-Airship in June 1987.   Information suggests the FBI is looking at the airshipconsultants used by the Loral Corp., which acquired GoodyearAerospace during the competition, the Times said. The informationalso suggests the SEC is looking at whether Navy leaks affectedtrading in Airship stock before the winning bid was announced, itsaid.   The price of Airship stock, which trades over the counter in theUnited States, soared to $31 from $16 in the weeks before thecontract award was announced, the report said.   The stock is currently trading near $4, reflecting financingtroubles for the airship after the Navy terminated the projectearlier this year and passed it on to another Pentagon branch.   Goodyear Aerospace retained at least two Washington-areaconsultants who have figured in the Pentagon fraud inquiry, WilliamM. Galvin and William Parkin, aerospace executives familiar withthe program told the Times.   Federal investigators searched Loral's Akron, Ohio, offices inJune, focusing on company consultants used for the airshipcompetition, according to Thomas M. Seese, president of the UnitedAuto Workers local which represents about 1,400 workers at Loral'sAkron plant.   A Loral spokeswoman, Elizabeth Allen, said the company felt itwas inappropriate to comment on the investigation, but said Loralwas cooperating with investigators and believed the its activitieswere within ``the letter and the spirit of the law.''   The Westinghouse-Airship team retained for its liaison with theNavy a Washington lawyer who was a friend of then-Navy SecretaryJohn F. Lehman Jr., according to Airship officials.   There is no indication that activities of the lawyer or Lehmanare under investigation in the blimp matter, the Times said. Lehmandid not return telephone calls; the lawyer declined to comment.   A Westinghouse spokesman, Dick King, declined to comment on theuse of consultants in the airship competition, but said the companywas cooperating with an SEC inquiry into the trading of Airshipstock.   Officials of both agencies declined to discuss their inquiries.No one has been charged with wrongdoing. Navy officials declined tosay why Westinghouse got the contract, the Times said.</TEXT></DOC>
