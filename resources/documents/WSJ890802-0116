Whether Senator Heflin represents the Old South or the New South we are not entirely sure, but the Alabamian joined northern liberals to send a clear message to the William Lucases of the world: Blacks must hew to the party line or be destroyed. Know thy place.    Strom Thurmond of South Carolina understood the significance of the 7-7 Judiciary Committee vote refusing to &quot;give this black man a chance&quot; by not sending his name to the full Senate to be civil-rights chief at the Justice Department. &quot;He's a minority, of course. Years ago minorities didn't have a chance,&quot; he said, recalling Jim Crow. &quot;I know.&quot;    Joe Biden said Senator Thurmond's accusation of liberal Democrat racism against a black Republican was &quot;a cynical setup.&quot; But Mr. Biden, the 76th-place finisher in his law class of 85, made a pure plantation argument why Mr. Lucas must be kept down. Senator Biden said he had &quot;failed miserably to prove that he has some knowledge to compensate for his lack of experience.&quot; Teddy Kennedy, whose brother decided Bobby was fully qualified to be attorney general despite no experience at all, declared that Mr. Lucas is &quot;the wrong man for this very important job.&quot; No white nominee has ever been rejected for agreeing with the President or saying he'd enforce Supreme Court rulings.    This party-line vote (with Democrat Dennis DeConcini backing Mr. Lucas) against a moderate black with a long history of public service and law enforcement raises the political stakes. Mr. Lucas got smeared partly because he dared to leave the Democratic Party. He's hardly alone. The black police chief of Washington, D.C., just became a Republican. Charles Evers, Mayor of Fayette, Mississippi, and brother of slain civilrights worker Medgar, switched in May because the Democratic Party &quot;is now a party of liberal ideas and special interest groups.&quot;    Attorney General Thornburgh was right to call yesterday's vote &quot;raw politics.&quot; But surely this vote goes beyond partisan politics to a broad philosophical confrontation. Mr. Lucas is part of a generation of blacks desperately worried about the deepest issues of civil rights. Crime, drugs and welfare pathologies are all encouraged by misguided government policies that remain liberal icons. Democrats swear fealty to the faith that civil rights is narrower, synonymous with quotas, set-asides and class-action lawsuits. This same dead religion, incidentally, is behind the Democrats' invocation of class warfare to oppose a capital-gains tax cut.    The White House is not powerless. Sources say that the administration is considering Bob Dole's suggestion that Mr. Lucas be made a recess appointment. This would be good for civil-rights enforcement because otherwise the job would be vacant for months given the Senate's snail pace for confirmations. Mr. Lucas would fill the slot through January 1991, when the next Congress begins. This would be an excellent recess-appointment precedent since Mr. Lucas never got to make his case to the full Senate as the Constitution requires.    Most importantly, this would show that President Bush is willing to use his constitutional powers. The Senate has made a mockery of its advice-and-consent power. Senator Heflin earlier distinguished himself as a yahoo when he decided to vote against Robert Bork, because he &quot;had a strange lifestyle&quot; and &quot;I was further disturbed by his refusal to discuss his belief in God -- or the lack thereof.&quot;    The administration could also consider other alternatives. Mr. Lucas would make an excellent deputy attorney general. The Democrats have said that it's just this job that Mr. Lucas shouldn't have, that he'd be fine for a job requiring his considerable managerial skills. Whichever route the administration chooses, the important thing is to nip this liberal plantation mentality in the bud.    There is a core civil-rights issue now at stake. If the Bush administration rolls over on the trashing of Bill Lucas, it will send a truly ugly message to America's blacks -- one political party insists that they stay on the plantation, and the other party won't fight to liberate them. This would be an ironic disenfranchisement of blacks, whose most basic civil right is the freedom to follow their own political beliefs. </TEXT></DOC>
