The dollar came under pressure in early New York trading following a report that new factory orders for durable goods in the U.S. fell a seasonally adjusted 7.5% in January from December.    That report nudged the dollar down to its intraday low of 1.8130 West German marks before it recovered to 1.8225 marks late in the day. That was still off from 1.8273 marks Wednesday, but traders said the dollar would have fallen farther if it hadn't been for the expectation that central banks would move to support the currency.    &quot;Ninety percent of traders are bearish toward the dollar. There's no reason fundamentally to buy the dollar. The only thing protecting it is the fear of central banks,&quot; said John W. Baker, chief foreign-exchange trader at Bank Julius Baer andamp; Co., New York. He called the durable goods report &quot;very, very bearish&quot; for the U.S. unit.    Many traders believe the weeklong stretch of relative stability in exchange rates may snap today if the scheduled release of a report on January merchandise trade shows a U.S. deficit larger than the $14 billion gap generally expected. &quot;This is the one figure that we've been waiting for all week,&quot; Mr. Baker said.    Yesterday's release of the Tower Commission report, which was critical of the White House's dealings with Iran and the Nicaraguan rebels, didn't have any immediate effect on the dollar.    However, traders said the dollar has been under pressure all week as a result of leaked details on the report's contents, so the impact of its release was already partially reflected in exchange rates.    Market participants didn't cite Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker's comments to Congress as a factor in yesterday's trading. Mr. Volcker told a House Banking subcommittee that a further sharp decline by the dollar would be &quot;dangerous&quot; and warned that such a drop could lead to a U.S. recession. The Fed chief said it remains to be seen whether the dollar needs to fall over the long-term, as some economists believe.    Concern that the central banks of the U.S. and its major allies will buy dollars in the interbank market to oppose a sharp drop in the currency's value has damped trading since an agreement was announced Sunday following a meeting of finance ministers in Paris. That joint statement by officials representing the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada said the dollar's two-year drop had gone far enough, and called for exchange-rate stability. Participants said they also agreed to intervene in currency markets to enforce their decree.    &quot;This wasn't a phony challenge that they issued. Traders are understandably cautious,&quot; said Lawrence L. Kreicher, vice president and economist at Irving Trust Co., New York. &quot;These central bankers and finance ministers are playing a psychological game, and the market is vulnerable to that,&quot; he added.    The dollar eased to 152.98 Japanese yen yesterday from 153.41, and the British pound firmed to $1.5408 from $1.5393.    In early Tokyo trading Friday, the dollar rebounded to 153.05 yen.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery climbed $3.40 an ounce, to $406.50 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was three million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $406.55 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                       CURRENCY RATES                          New York    Home Mkt.
