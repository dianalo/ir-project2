The article mentions that a major Air Force base is one of the area's largest industries. Perhaps the entire payroll of the base was included in local income, but the military personnel were not counted as part of the local population, inasmuch as their permanent residences are elsewhere.    This would be analogous to the periodic surveys that show that Washington, D.C., leads the nation in per-capita liquor consumption. The numbers tend to be distorted by the large number of government and diplomatic personnel, as well as tourists, who are legal residents of other places, but are doing their best to support the local beverage purveyors while in Washington.
