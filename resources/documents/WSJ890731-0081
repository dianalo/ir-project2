Orders for U.S.-made machine tools in June dropped 38% from an unusually strong 1988 month, mainly because of order postponements by the auto industry, according to machine tool executives. Other manufacturers continue to order machine tools at a fairly good rate, industry executives say.    June orders for the complex machines that shape metal parts dropped to $238 million from $382.8 million a year earlier, but were up 16% from May's $205.3 million, according to the NMTBA -- The Association for Manufacturing Technology, a trade group based in McLean, Va.    &quot;Our automotive orders dropped off sharply about six weeks ago,&quot; says Neil P. Coughlin, vice president, sales and marketing, for Kingsbury Machine Tool Corp., Keene, N.H. He says auto companies are postponing orders for equipment to make engines, transmissions and other power train parts while they reassess production plans.    At some other machine tool builders, the drop in orders from auto and auto parts concerns occurred even earlier, pushing machine tool orders for the second quarter down 29% from a year earlier, according to NMTBA figures. Auto power train parts provided the machine tool industry's best market in 1988 and early 1989.    Members of the American Machine Tool Distributors' Association, Rockville, Md., said their June sales were up 1.1% from a year earlier, but have declined each month since a March peak. The distributors, who handle foreign as well as U.S.-made machines, are less dependent on autos because the auto makers buy most of their equipment directly from manufacturers.    Orders at U.S. plants for lathes, machining centers, milling machines, grinders, boring mills and other machines to shape metal by cutting fell to $156.2 million in June, down 35% from a year earlier's $238.4 million, NMTBA said.    June orders for metal-forming presses and other machines to shape metal with pressure were $81.9 million, 15% higher than the average of the previous 12 months but down 43% from a spectacular $144.5 million in June 1988.    Machine tool industry executives aren't terribly upset so far. &quot;We're pretty optimistic about the outlook for the remainder of the year, despite the mixed signals on the economy,&quot; says Daniel J. Meyer, president, Cincinnati Milacron Inc., the industry's largest producer. &quot;In the past month, business has been looking better than it did earlier this year,&quot; he says. &quot;Aerospace, heavy machinery and general manufacturing all are ordering.&quot;    Cross andamp; Trecker Corp.'s orders continue to run ahead of a year earlier, says Walter J. Aspatore, president of the Bloomfield Hills, Mich., concern. &quot;We have had good orders for machining centers, lathes, flexible manufacturing systems and measuring equipment.&quot;    So far, few auto plant equipment programs have been canceled. And machine tool builders figure U.S. auto companies have no choice but to buy equipment to increase productivity and make their cars more competitive. But orders could be postponed into 1990 or later.    The economic slowdown engineered by the Federal Reserve Board to curb inflation has had a greater impact on the auto industry than on most of the rest of the economy; sales for the year to date are down 6.5% from a year earlier in spite of expensive sales promotions. Many auto executives expect even softer sales in the 1989 second half.    And the auto industry's lower sales, profits and cash flow are only part of the problem, machine tool executives say. Auto makers also are re-examining plans for 1992 engines and transmissions because it appears that federal fuel economy regulations will be tighter than auto executives expected. Some muscle cars may have to be deferred or eliminated from the lineup, replaced by less exciting vehicles that deliver better mileage.    In addition, it is becoming increasingly clear that there's excess capacity in the U.S. auto industry. Japanese producers are rapidly expanding U.S. production capacity, and U.S. auto demand isn't likely to rise rapidly enough to absorb the output of those factories on top of Big Three production. The likely result: General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. will have to scale back production in the early 1990s.    Kingsbury's Mr. Coughlin is hopeful that the auto makers' uncertainty about what models will be needed in 1992 will result in higher orders for flexible production systems that his company offers.    Meanwhile, machine tool production continues unabated, as producers work off sizable backlogs. Shipments in June totaled $327.6 million, NMTBA said, up 53% from $214.1 million a year earlier. Shipments for the first half rose 41% to $1.51 billion, leaving June 30 backlogs at $2.17 billion.    ---@ Comparative new orders for metal-cutting machines: @ Jun. 1989 May 1989 Jun. 1988 @ Domestic ...... $120,350,000 $138,100,000 $210,650,000 @ Foreign ......... 35,800,000 9,800,000 27,700,000 @ Total .......... 156,150,000 147,900,000 238,350,000 @ Six month total for 1989: $1,059,400,000; for 1988: $1,342,750,000. @ Metal-forming machine orders: @ Domestic ....... $72,850,000 $49,850,000 $134,600,000 @ Foreign .......... 9,000,000 7,500,000 9,850,000 @ Total ........... 81,850,000 57,350,000 144,450,000 @ Six month total for 1989: $429,700,000; for 1988: $467,750,000. @ Comparative shipment of metal-cutting machines: @ Domestic ...... $199,850,000 $145,400,000 $116,000,000 @ Foreign ........ 35,900,000 13,000,000 16,800,000 @ Total .......... 235,750,000 158,400,000 132,800,000 @ Six month total for 1989: $1,059,750,000; for 1988: $657,200,000. @ Metal-forming machine shipments: @ Domestic ....... $70,100,000 $74,100,000 $69,250,000 @ Foreign ......... 21,750,000 8,250,000 12,000,000 @ Total ........... 91,850,000 82,350,000 81,250,000 @ Six month total for 1989: $445,800,000; for 1988: $410,450,000. </TEXT></DOC>
