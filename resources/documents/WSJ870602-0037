Although the dollar fell back from its intraday highs in U.S. trading, dealers said it continued to be supported by technical factors, some position-squaring and Friday's disclosure of the magnitude of central bank intervention in support of the U.S. currency.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 145.05 Japanese yen, a 0.8% rise from 143.83 Friday but below its intraday high of 145.85 yen.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar stood at 144.92 yen.    The currency also climbed to 1.8403 West German marks before settling back to 1.8278, or 0.4% above its late Friday level of 1.8205 marks.    The dollar got off to a bullish start in Tokyo and picked up further momentum as traders bid its value up past one psychological barrier after another. The rally was partly attributed to technical factors that strongly favored the currency, based on analysis of recent trading patterns.    A political propellant was also injected by the deputy president of the West German Bundesbank, Helmut Schlesinger. At a news conference to announce the opening of the central bank's Tokyo office, Mr. Schlesinger said he was satisfied with the dollar's recent upward trend and that a further decline in its value is &quot;unnecessary.&quot;    He also said current exchange rates are consistent with the agreement on exchange-rate stability that was reached in Paris in February by the U.S., West Germany, Japan, France, Britain and Canada.    The dollar also benefited from traders' caution ahead of next week's Venice economic summit involving those six nations and Italy. Robert Paul, vice president and foreign exchange manager at Bank of Boston, said the likelihood of a reaffirmation of the Paris agreement in Venice prompted some traders to correct any oversold dollar positions.    The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said Friday it intervened in foreign exchange trading by buying more than $4 billion to support the U.S. currency in the three months ended April 30. It was also reported yesterday that other major central banks purchased nearly $40 billion in the currency markets in the same period.    &quot;The numbers create an impression in the market that the Fed intervened to a greater extent than people thought,&quot; James T. McGroarty, vice president, foreign exchange, at Discount Corp. of New York, said. &quot;That suggests that the dollar shouldn't fall much further.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $4 an ounce to $446.20 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $445.15 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                  LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Monday, June 1, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
