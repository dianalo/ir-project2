The regulations signed by Mr. Meese establish specific procedures and timetables for preliminary Justice Department investigations of alleged criminal activity by lawmakers, and for the subsequent appointment of independent prosecutors, if warranted.    During his last press conference as the nation's top law-enforcement official, Mr. Meese said the move was necessary to end the &quot;undesirable disparity between the way that members of the executive branch and members of the legislative branch {are} treated when it comes to allegations of criminal wrongdoing.&quot;    The order calls for prosecutors to be appointed by the attorney general, rather than by a special federal appeals court panel here, which has jurisdiction over certain criminal investigations of high-ranking executive branch officials. Prosecutors would operate independently of the attorney general, and could be removed only for &quot;extraordinary improprieties.&quot;    Mr. Meese, who has been investigated by two separate, court-appointed prosecutors since he came to Washington in 1981, said in the order that he wants to &quot;demonstrate to the public that neither political hostility nor political favoritism&quot; will affect criminal investigations of lawmakers.    Current criminal investigations that touch on legislators, including the nationwide Pentagon fraud and influence-peddling inquiry, are exempt from the final regulations.    Mr. Meese's announcement, which wasn't discussed beforehand with any lawmakers and surprised even some of his top aides, came barely two hours before Richard Thornburgh was sworn in as his successor. Agency officials said the matter was discussed briefly with Mr. Thornburgh, but the new head of the Justice Department isn't bound by the decision.    The attorney general already has the power to pursue wrongdoing by members of Congress, either directly or by relying on U.S. attorneys. However, aides to Mr. Meese said the new policy is intended to clarify such authority and limit the discretion of future attorneys general in handling politically sensitive cases involving senators or representatives.    The Reagan administration unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of court-appointed independent counsels. And on the campaign trail, Vice President George Bush has criticized Congress for rejecting administration proposals to extend the law to cover lawmakers, rather than just high executive-branch officials.    Under Mr. Meese's order, if the Justice Department receives &quot;specific and credible&quot; evidence of potential criminal violations by a lawmaker, the attorney general must launch a preliminary investigation lasting no more than 90 days. After that, he can close the case, or appoint an independent prosecutor to conduct a full-fledged investigation. The details of the allegations could become public after such an appointment is made, if the attorney general determines that disclosure &quot;would be in the best interests of justice.&quot;    But, according to Mr. Meese, the prosecutors he envisions wouldn't disclose their findings if they decide against seeking criminal charges. Mr. Meese expressed anger last month when independent counsel James McKay, after deciding against prosecuting Mr. Meese, nevertheless released a report accusing him of probable violations of the law.    Some lawmakers criticized the order as unnecessary and misguided. And Rudolph Giuliani, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, told reporters that he didn't consider it a good idea. U.S. attorneys have demonstrated &quot;an excellent record of handling those cases fairly, effectively {and} independently,&quot; Mr. Giuliani asserted. &quot;So I don't believe there's a need for it.&quot;    On other topics related to his three-and-a-half-year stewardship of the Justice Department, Mr. Meese remained combative and blamed the press for many of his problems. He continued to defend San Francisco attorney Robert Wallach, his longtime friend and confidant, who is under federal indictment on racketeering and other charges stemming from the Wedtech Corp. scandal. Mr. Wallach never asked &quot;me to do anything that was improper, illegal or in any way inappropriate,&quot; Mr. Meese said. </TEXT></DOC>
