VERNACI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Winning the New Hampshire primary gave littlemore than bragging rights to Vice President George Bush andDemocrat Michael Dukakis, as each came away with just a handful ofnational convention delegates.   Bush, who picked up 38 percent of the Republican vote in theprimary, gained 11 of New Hampshire's 23 delegates to the GOPnational convention. In all, Bush now has 61 delegates.   Dukakis, who got 36 percent of the Democratic vote in theTuesday primary, won nine of the state's 18 pledged delegates tothe national convention. The Massachusetts governor has 44.5delegates.   The lift from the early primaries and caucuses is morepsychological than tangible as the candidates pursue the 1,139delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination orthe 2,082 delegates for the Democratic nomination.   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas gained sevendelegates in New Hampshire Tuesday to bring his national total to42, while Rep. Jack Kemp of New York won three delegates to raisehis total to 35.   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the winner of last week'sIowa Democratic caucuses, gained six national convention delegatesfor his second-place showing in New Hampshire, and Sen. Paul Simonof Illinois followed with three delegates. In the popular vote inNew Hampshire, Gephardt won 20 percent while Simon had 17 percent.   Gephardt now has 39 delegates, while Simon has 33.   Under Democratic Party rules, the national convention delegateswere awarded proportionally to candidates who receive at least 15percent of the vote. In effect, that disqualified Jesse Jackson,Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, former Arizona Gov. BruceBabbitt and former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart from receiving anydelegates from New Hampshire.   Jackson won 8 percent of the vote, Gore 7 percent, Babbitt 5percent and Hart 4 percent.   New Hampshire Republicans have a similar rule, but the thresholdis 10 percent. That meant former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, whohad 10 percent, picked up two delegates, but former televisionevangelist Pat Robertson, who was within 1,100 votes of du Pont,received no delegates because he had just 9.5 percent of the vote.   Robertson already had eight delegates, while du Pont had nonebefore Tuesday's primary.   Among the Democrats, Gore already had 10.55 delegates, Jacksonhad 9.8 and Babbitt had four.   The delegate totals for the Republicans include results fromMichigan, Kansas, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Guam. AlthoughIowa and Hawaii both have held GOP caucuses, precise delegatefigures cannot be calculated until later because of the way theselection process is structured.   The Democratic totals include results from Iowa and NewHampshire, as well as an Associated Press survey of Democraticgovernors and Democratic National Committee members who will serveautomatically as delegates to their party's convention. Some of theDemocratic delegates cast fractions of votes at the convention.</TEXT></DOC>
