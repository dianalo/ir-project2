Bankruptcy judges, more accustomed to narrower economicmatters, are increasingly confronting this profound legal andreligious question in cases involving bankrupt individualswho seek to continue donating a portion of their income to areligious organization.</LP><TEXT>   Since a debtor's money essentially belongs to his or hercreditors until the debts are repaid, creditors argue thattithing (typically paying 10% of income to a religious group)is a form of robbing Peter to pay Paul. They claim that suchpayments are unfair, as well as unconstitutional, becausethey entwine the court in religious matters and favorreligions that require tithing over ones that don't.   But debtors contend that religious tithing is one of theirbasic needs, which -- like food and clothing -- they must bepermitted to provide for while in bankruptcy. The debtorsalso argue that their First Amendment right to practice theirreligion free from government interference includes the rightto donate a portion of their income to the church.   There have been at least 20 such cases this year alone,possibly reflecting an overall rise in personal bankruptcies,which have more than doubled to more than 660,000 a yearsince 1985. Faced with strong arguments on both sides, judgeshave been reaching widely inconsistent results: &quot;The casesare pretty well split,&quot; says Judge Laurence Howard, a federalbankruptcy judge in Grand Rapids, Mich., who in a 1987 casewrote the first published opinion on the First Amendment andtithing.   One judicial approach, it seems, is to aim for theSolomonic. In a case decided last May, federal bankruptcyJudge Nancy C. Dreher in Minneapolis ruled that a monthlytithe of $540 to a Lutheran church was excessive whencreditors were to receive $600 monthly under the plan. JudgeDreher acknowledged a First Amendment right to make donationsbut said judges could still demand that a debtor reduce theamount of the donation before approving the plan. She sentthe debtor back to come up with a more acceptable figure.   However, in a decision handed down in April, Judge Glen E.Clark, a federal bankruptcy judge in Salt Lake City, took adifferent tack, rejecting the debtors' monthly payment of$217 to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints onthe ground that the payment wasn't a necessary expense underbankruptcy law.   Under Mormon doctrine, a failure to tithe may result indenial of a &quot;temple recommend,&quot; which means, according to aspokesman for the Mormon church, that the debtor would not beallowed to enter the temple, a separate building where sacredceremonies such as marriages are performed. Some say thatkind of religious tenet presents the strongest argument forapproving tithing.   But Judge Clark said the purpose of Chapter 13 of thefederal Bankruptcy Code, which covers personal bankruptciesinvolving debts of $100,000 or less, is to provide thegreatest recovery to creditors and that denial of &quot;a templerecommend&quot; didn't make the tithe a necessary expense.   While Judge Clark didn't question whether the debtor'sreligious beliefs were sincere, such considerations oftenenter into these cases. For example, in cases where a judgeconcludes that a debtor has conveniently undergone areligious conversion in order to divert funds from creditors,judges have denied the repayment plan for lack of good faith.   Conversely, Judge Howard of Grand Rapids noted in the 1987opinion that a husband and wife seeking to tithe had appearedextremely devout. Thus, he approved their three-yearrepayment plan that reserved $140 monthly payments to theirPentecostal church but only $96.33 a month to theircreditors.   &quot;To deny confirmation of this plan solely because {thedebtor} tithes would be to deny her {referring to the wife inthe case} the benefits of the Bankruptcy Code because ofconduct mandated by her religious beliefs,&quot; he wrote in hisopinion. &quot;To condition confirmation upon her ceasing to tithewould be to put pressure on {her} to violate her beliefs.&quot;   Because the debtors also were paying back a state studentloan, the case had an added twist: The state argued that ifthe debtors gave money to the church instead of to the state,in effect the state would be subsidizing the church. That,argued James D. Clarke, an assistant Michigan attorneygeneral, would violate the First Amendment's prohibitionagainst entangling the state with a religion.   Judge Howard was unpersuaded. He ruled that there wouldn'tbe a transfer of government funds to the church and,therefore, not enough to &quot;confer the imprimatur of stateapproval&quot; on the religion. Judge Howard adds that the debtorsin this case eventually rendered unto Caesar all that wasCaesar's.   Given all the confusion in the law, Baruch Cohen, a rabbiand recent law school graduate, suggests that judges couldfind a more principled way to decide these cases if theyexamined whether the debtor's own religion condones tithingwith other people's money.   Mr. Cohen says that for more than 2,000 years, Jewish lawhas recognized that debtors' money belongs to creditors andthat debtors can't do what they please with it. Jewish lawshields food, shelter and books from creditors but doesn'texempt tithing, he says.   Mr. Cohen argues that bankruptcy judges should base theirdecisions on testimony from clergy concerning the law of therelevant religion. &quot;It doesn't have to be a First Amendmentissue,&quot; says Mr. Cohen. While agreeing that expert testimonyby clergy would be useful, bankruptcy-law specialist DavidGray Carlson notes that debtors deserve some considerationfor having entered Chapter 13 bankruptcy voluntarily to helprepay creditors. &quot;These creditors are already better off,&quot;says Mr. Carlson, a professor at Yeshiva University'sBenjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. &quot;By cutting off {debtors'}religious donations, that strikes me as overreaching.&quot;   ---   PATIENT'S DECISION on mental illness treatment must behonored, judge rules.   The decision by state Justice Leland DeGrasse in New Yorkis believed to be among the first to extend the same kind of&quot;living will&quot; protection usually afforded the terminally illto the mentally ill.   The decision arises out of a dispute over whether doctorsat a New York state mental hospital could applyelectroconvulsive therapy, commonly known as electroshocktreatment, to a woman identified as Rosa M. The attorneysacting on her behalf objected to the treatment, arguing thatMs. M. had refused such therapy when she was mentallycompetent and that her wishes must still be respected. She isnow considered mentally incompetent and is an involuntarypatient at Manhattan Psychiatric Center on Ward's Island.   In his decision, Justice DeGrasse, who sits on the statetrial court, ruled that Ms. M., while still mentallycompetent, had written an &quot;unambiguous&quot; statement of herwishes not to have electroshock therapy. He added that caselaw, which holds that &quot;a patient's knowing and informedrejection of certain medical treatments must be respectedeven when the patient becomes incompetent,&quot; extends to thementally ill.   Medical ethicists said they were unaware of similarrulings but that the decision extending &quot;living will&quot; typeprotection to the mentally ill made sense. &quot;A lot ofliving-will statutes are too narrow. People often can beincapacitated when not terminally ill,&quot; said Susan M. Wolf,an associate for law at the Hastings Center, a medical ethicsthink-tank in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. (Matter of Rosa M.,State Supreme Court, Part 25, New York City.)   ---   WESTINGHOUSE SUIT against three law firms is dismissed byfederal judge.   Named in the lawsuit by Westinghouse Electric Corp. wereChase, Rotchford, Drukker andamp; Bogust Law Corp., of Los Angeles,and Newman andamp; Holtzinger and Shaw, Pittman, Potts andamp;Trowbridge, both of Washington, D.C.   The suit, which was dismissed by U.S. District JudgeConsuelo B. Marshall of Los Angeles on procedural matters,claimed the law firms misused confidential documents toencourage utility companies to sue Westinghouse. ThePittsburgh company said it will appeal the decision to theNinth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.   Gerald Charnoff of Shaw Pittman said the dismissalindicates the Westinghouse suit &quot;was patently without merit.&quot;(Westinghouse Electric Corp. vs. Newman andamp; Holtzinger et al.,U.S. District Court, Los Angeles, CV 91-4952)   ---   NOTED: The European Court of Human Rights ruled that theBritish government violated the rights of three Britishnewspapers by forbidding them to print extracts of&quot;Spycatcher,&quot; the memoirs of former intelligence agent PeterWright, the Associated Press reported. The court ordered thegovernment to pay about $180,000 each to the Guardian, theObserver and the Sunday Times to cover legal costs. Judgmentsby the court oblige signatories of the European Convention ofHuman Rights, including Britain, to ensure their nationallaws are consistent with its rulings.   ---   Jonathan M.
