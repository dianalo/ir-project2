Why the trip to Damascus in the first place? As far as weknow, there is a &quot;government&quot; in Lebanon (albeit under thethumb of Syria) that is fully supported by the U.S.administration, a functioning U.S. Embassy in Beirut and anairport that has been open for some time.</LP><TEXT>   Are we trying to reward the murderous Syrian regime, whichhas been implicated in the destruction of the U.S. Embassy inBeirut in April 1983, the slaughter of U.S. Marines in theirbarracks in October 1983, the downing of Pan Am Flight 103 atLockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988 with the loss of 270innocent lives, and countless other heinous crimes?   How can the White House brush off Syria's previouslysuspected involvement in the Lockerbie massacre and declarethat the Syrians were given a &quot;bum rap&quot; -- how cruel thatstatement is to the relatives of the victims who feel thereis an attempt at political cover-up of the nefarious rolesplayed by both Syria and Iran.   I hope the door to the investigation will not be summarilyclosed now that two putative Libyan individuals have beenindicted in this monstrous outrage.   Charles R. Farra, M.D.   Riverside, Ill.   ---   I am surprised that the bestial treatment of the hostageshasn't provoked harsh criticism from Muslim religiousleaders.   To chain men to a wall, isolated in a room for all but 10or 20 minutes a day, and to continue this day after day foryears] How can anyone believe this has the blessing of God?   Condemnation should not come only from the West. Moralleaders in the Arab world ought to come forward. Where is themullah to speak against this shame on sponsors Syria andIran? This is simply the indulgence of power, the power tosubjugate for the sick thrill of it.   What an insult to say this was done in the name of Allah.   Martin Gal   Kalamazoo, Mich.</TEXT></DOC>
