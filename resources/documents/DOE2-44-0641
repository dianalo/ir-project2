The pulses overvoltaged supply mode ofa microchannel plate has brought about amplification necessary for inputinto plateau of the counting characteristics and photoacceptor strobingin the nanosecond (140 ns) range. Device noises are practically completelydetermined by noises in luminescence amplifier photocathode. the abovemultichannel counter has a durable stability of parameters, electronicsystem simplicity and small dimensions of the photoacceptor.</TEXT></DOC>
