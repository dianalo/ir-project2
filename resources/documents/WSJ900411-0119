The development, to be announced today at an opticalcomputing conference in Kobe, Japan, shows that ATandamp;Tcontinues to make important progress in its drive towardsuperfast data processing based on light rather thanelectricity.</LP><TEXT>   ATandamp;T said it will unveil an experimental device thatcombines the world's smallest lasers with a network of tinylenses and mirrors -- all on a quartz glass disk about oneinch in diameter and an eighth of an inch thick. Readilymade, the new device can be used to connect conventionalcomputer chips. Since it uses light, the resultingconnections carry more information and are faster thanordinary electronic connections, said Tod Sizer, a Bell Labsscientist.   It has been known for some time that communicating withlight makes sense over long distances -- that's why telephonecompanies use fiber-optic cables to transmit phone calls, forexample.   But ATandamp;T has faced skepticism about its claims that lightis a practical way to communicate between computer chips atdistances as short as a few millimeters. And the company hasfaced downright disbelief about its determination to developan all-optical computer -- one that would use light not justto communicate, but to do calculations.   The new device should quiet such criticism, Mr. Sizersaid. The device uses ATandamp;T's advanced &quot;microlaser&quot; technologyand a technique called diffractive optics, in whichmicroscopic lines that act as lenses and mirrors are etchedon quartz. This technology, which Mr. Sizer said is far morestable and manufacturable than previous methods, will likelyplay a large role in the company's optical computer.   Indeed, sources said ATandamp;T is close to developing anall-light computer processor -- one with very limitedabilities -- that fits on a piece of quartz the size of anindex card.   That compares favorably with its last experimental set-up,unveiled at the end of January: Hailed as a breakthrough, itconnected components on a lab bench using an unwieldycollection of precision-mounted lasers, lenses, prisms andmirrors.   The advance evokes visions of a futuristic computer thatdoes its calculations by firing laser beams through aspecially manufactured block of quartz -- an image thatATandamp;T's optical computer guru, Alan Huang, has said won't befar from the truth.   For the moment, however, Mr. Sizer said the technologywill likely be used to boost the performance of electroniccomputers, especially supercomputers.   ATandamp;T also said it will demonstrate the nascenttechnology's first application to its core telecommunicationsbusiness -- a device that uses light to switch voice, dataand video signals -- next week in Atlanta.</TEXT></DOC>
