The UH-1 Huey fell about 200 feet and then crashed into amountain stream and exploded at about 9:45 p.m. Wednesday nearRougon, a village 60 miles northwest of Nice.   The craft was from the amphibious assault ship Guadalcanal, inport in Toulon, and was assigned to Marine Medium HelicopterSquadron 162 based at the New River, N.C., Marine Corps Air Station.   In Washington, the Marine Corps identified four of the victimsas: Maj. Bruce A. Boulton, 37, a helicopter pilot from BrowardCounty, Fla.; 1st Lt. Michael P. Wilkes, 26, a helicopter pilotfrom Akron, Ohio; Cpl. Terry A. Miles, 22, a helicopter mechanicfrom Ashland, Ky.; and Lance Cpl. Matthew F. Rossell, 21, ahelicopter mechanic from Des Moines, Iowa.   The fifth victim was identified by his father as Cpl. Lansden R.Good III, 24, of Paducah, Ky.   The pilots were using night-vision goggles, but militaryofficials said there was no reason to suspect the goggles played arole in the crash.   A Marine official in Washington, however, said the goggles donot permit pilots to see power lines.   The Army recently ordered a safety inspection of itsnight-vision goggles after several crashes.   Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., who favors a temporary suspensionof the goggles, called Thursday for a coordinated Pentagoninvestigation and a review of the military use of the goggles.   McCloskey said he spoke recently with a retired Army generalunder whose command a fatal night training crash occurred.   ``This individual is emphatic that the goggles are not safe forflight use. To continue using the devices when even upper echelonofficers are recommending against it simply makes no sense,''McCloskey said. He did not identify the Army general.   Authorities in Digne ordered an investigation into the accident.   The Marine Corps said the Huey was the lead helicopter of twoaircraft conducting a navigation training exercise. The otherhelicopter was not involved in the accident.   The helicopter was one of 13 taking part in France-U.S. trainingexercises in southern France from April 29 to May 19, said PeterAntico, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Paris.</TEXT></DOC>
