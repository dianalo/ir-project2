Les Aspin (D., Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. His comment came during hearings by that panel.    About 85 defense contracts are touched by the nationwide investigation, which focuses on allegations of bribery and bid-rigging inside the Pentagon. &quot;We will revisit every contract involved here,&quot; said Kathleen Buck, the Defense Department's general counsel.    Among other projects, the investigation focuses on the electronic-systems integration work for the Aegis cruiser, the development of the Navy's advanced tactical aircraft, and the engine for the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft.    The Pentagon commitment to revisit the contracts doesn't mean the work will be switched to other arms makers. In the past, when contractors have been convicted of procurement fraud, the Pentagon has suspended them from new jobs for several months. Ms. Buck also noted that some individuals involved in wrongdoing have been barred permanently from defense work.    The Pentagon would prefer to take such steps rather than reopen defense jobs to new bids. However, the current scandal differs from past problems, which usually involved some type of overcharging by the contractor. In this case, it's alleged that contractors won armament jobs in the first place by bribing government officials or buying proprietary information.    Moreover, there are contractors who may have lost defense work as a result of questionable practices by the competitors. For example, workers for General Electric Co. have been laid off because of engine work awarded to United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitney unit. Union officials already have suggested that the General Electric workers consider demanding some form of redress if it is shown that Pratt andamp; Whitney won the contract because it had access to proprietary information.    While the Pratt andamp; Whitney contract is one of those being investigated, nobody has charged the United Technologies unit with having improperly obtained information involving the bidding.    If companies are allowed to keep tainted contracts, Mr. Aspin said, &quot;You're going to be rewarding malfeasance.&quot; But, he acknowledged, reopening the contracts would involve &quot;enormous delays&quot; in defense programs.    Rep. Nicholas Mavroules (D., Mass.) said that if contracts can't be withdrawn from companies that won them illegally, &quot;I've got to conclude that existing statutes can't be enforced.&quot;    Robert Costello, defense undersecretary for acquisition, acknowledged the difficulty. &quot;It's a tough, tough issue,&quot; he said.    Throughout the day-long hearing, Pentagon officials avoided any discussion of the investigation itself, but defended the integrity of the overall weapons-procurement system. Mr. Costello attributed the alleged wrongdoing to &quot;greed,&quot; and insisted that the procurement system fucntions better today than it did in 1980.    This defense, coupled with the lack of new information on the investigation itself, exasperated some lawmakers. During a sharp exchange with Mr. Costello, Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D., Colo.) declared: &quot;You drive me crazy.&quot; Later, prefacing a a reply to a question, a Navy official said: &quot;I may drive you crazy, too.&quot;    Meanwhile, law enforcement officials said they increasingly are delving into the activities of retired Navy Adm. James Lyons, who was hired last year as a consultant to McDonnell Douglas Corp. to promote sales of the company's F/A-18 jets to South Korea and Taiwan. Federal agents want to determine what company executives knew about efforts by Adm. Lyons and former Navy Assistant Secretary Melvin Paisley to influence U.S. officials to support such sales.    Taiwan and South Korea are weighing buying either the McDonnell Douglas jet or F-16s produced by General Dynamics Corp.    The name of Adm. Lyons, former commander-in-chief of the Pacific fleet, surfaced in court papers filed by the government earlier this month. But according to one federal investigator, &quot;the full extent of his role and contacts at the Pentagon&quot; haven't yet been disclosed. Investigators said they believe that McDonnell Douglas hired Adm. Lyons on the recommendation of Mr. Paisley, who also served as a consultant to the company.    Adm. Lyons couldn't be reached for comment, and Mr. Paisley's lawyer hasn't commented on this aspect of the investigation.    In another development, a spokesman for Attorney General Edwin Meese said that Mr. Meese earlier this week removed himself from all decisions involving the overall Pentagon fraud investigation. The reason, according to agency officials, is that the law firm representing Mr. Meese in a year-old investigation of the attorney general's activities by independent prosecutor James McKay now also represents two other clients connected to the Pentagon inquiry. Mr. Meese's office didn't identify the clients.    Separately, the Associated Press reported that federal prosecutors have learned of several instances of documents being destroyed by people implicated in the investigation.    The wire service said the disclosure was contained in a brief submitted by the office of Henry Hudson, the U.S. attorney in Alexandria, Va., and chief prosecutor in the Pentagon investigation, to a federal judge in Brooklyn, N.Y. The judge had been asked by Newsday, a Long Island newspaper, to unseal certain documents. Mr. Hudson didn't provide any details about who destroyed documents, how they were destroyed or how they might have been related to the investigation.    ---   Edward T.
