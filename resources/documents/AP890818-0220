Gold prices were mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,gold bullion for current delivery lost 20 cents to finish at $368.10a troy ounce. Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bidlater at $366 an ounce, down 20 cents from Thursday.   Buying interest in the dollar abated following the climbtriggered by Thursday's release of a better-than-expected U.S. tradereport for July, which boosted the U.S. currency to levels not seensince its most recent rally in June.   ``The dollar is right back to where we were before the tradenumber came out,'' said Michael McDonald, a trader with Harris Trustandamp; Savings Bank in Chicago.   A Labor Department report released Friday showed that drops inenergy and clothing prices held the rise in July consumer prices tojust 0.2 percent, a further indication that inflation is restrained.   But traders characterized the report as a non-event since it waslargely within expectations. ``Most people are anticipating the(Federal Reserve) will not be easing interest rates in the next weekor two,'' McDonald said.   With a battery of Japanese government bonds due to mature nextweek, traders were speculating whether any of that money would flowto U.S. securities. But the threat of central bank interventionoverseas during the weekend made them reluctant to bid the dollarhigher.   The dollar held to a narrow range, and trading was active, saidDavid Ogg, a vice president at Credit Suisse.   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 143.52 Japanese yen, upfrom 142.32.
