Foreign Minister Roland Dumas flew to Kuwait Monday for a briefstate visit after a two-day trip to Iran.   The Kuwait News Agency, quoted diplomats traveling with Dumas,said: ``He (Dumas) obtained a promise from responsible officials (inTehran) that a number of Western hostages held in Lebanon will bereleased within a short period.'' The diplomats did not elaborate,the report said.   Iran has influence over the fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party ofGod, which is considered an umbrella for groups holding most of the15 foreign hostages in Lebanon. Iranian officials, however,dissociate themselves from the kidnappers.   The 15 hostages in Lebanon are nine Americans, three Britons, oneBelgian, one Irishman and one Italian. The longest held is TerryAnderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,who was abducted March 16, 1985.   In a statement at Kuwait international airport, Dumas said hisweekend trip to Tehran achieved its objectives and was ``fruitful inmany ways.''   ``I discussed the entire file of French-Iran relations and laiddown a blueprint for a future relationship,'' he said.   Iranian media generally were hostile toward the Dumas visit,pointing out that France was a major arms supplier to Iraq duringthe eight-year Iran-Iraq war halted by an Aug. 20 cease-fire.   In Tehran, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told a newsconference Monday that France and Iran had agreed ``to forget thepast and think of expanding mutual ties in the future.''   But he accused France of not keeping a promise to free AnisNaccache, leader of a pro-Iranian terrorist squad jailed forattempting to assassinate a former Iranian prime minister.   Velayati said France had pledged to free Naccache, a Lebanesenational, in return for an Iranian promise to use its influence withthe Lebanese Shiite factions for the release of French hostagesformerly held in Lebanon.   ``Unfortunately they haven't kept this promise,'' Velayati said,adding, ``We do hope that Mr. Naccache will be released.''   Naccache was convicted of leading a five-man squad in a 1980attempt to kill ex-Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar outside his homein a Paris suburb. Bakhtiar was unhurt, but a French woman and apolice officer were killed and three police officers were wounded.   Last week, Naccache appealed to Iran to insist on his release,implying that a pardon was part of the deal that led to freedom forthe last three French captives in May.   On Sunday, former French Interior Minister Charles Pasquarepeated earlier French denials that a deal was made.   Bakhtiar was the last prime minister to serve under the late ShahReza Pahlavi before the Iranian monarchy was overthrown in 1979.</TEXT></DOC>
