Therefore, these systems cannot easilybe adapted to take into account the technological advancements beingmade with respect to the design of household electrical appliances, unlesscompatibility is built into this type of equipment by the manufacturer.International normatives are being planned which establish acceptabletolerance levels for disturbances. The levels of the main disturbances(variations of tension and harmonics) are dependent upon the short circuitpower which the electric network presents at its different nodes. Oncethe relationship between the system's ability to satisfy network loadsat every point and the corresponding short circuit power is determined,it becomes possible to proportion admissible disturbances based on powerutilized by the user. Models are now being studied to determine the feasibilityof this approach.</TEXT></DOC>
