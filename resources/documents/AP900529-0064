SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Candidates supported by the Solidaritytrade union held a strong lead over the Communists in communitycouncil elections across the nation, according to unofficialreturns reported today.   Preliminary results from the national General ElectionCommission indicated that Solidarity candidates swept 59 of 60seats in the Baltic port of Gdansk, where the union was foundednearly a decade ago.   Candidates backed by the union also were reported to be doingwell in the large cities of Warsaw, Krakow, Katowice andCzestochowa in the first free elections for local councils sinceWorld War II.   There were 52,000 individual races for seats on more than 2,000councils, and the official results were to be announced Wednesday.   During four decades of Communist rule, Poland's ommunitycouncils were largely under the control of the central governmentin Warsaw, but the new ones will be autonomous.   Despite strong campaign efforts, the reformed Communist Partyappeared to have done poorly.   The Social Democrats, as the former Communists call themselves,won two seats in the cities of Kielce and Czestochowa, four inOpole, six in Lodz and 15 out of 341 seats in Warsaw, according tothe unofficial returns.   Voter turnout was only 42 percent, and it appeared many peoplestayed away because of confusion over the large number of partiesrunning candidates.   Nearly 80 new parties have been formed in the last six months,but many have not presented clearly defined programs.   The most organized political force in the country is the localCitizens Committees founded a year ago by Solidarity supporters tocontest elections.   They faced competition in some areas.   A group representing ethnic Byelorussians won a majority of thevote in the town of Bialowieza, and about 25 percent of the vote intwo other towns in the northeastern province of Bialystok, not farfrom the Soviet border.   The Confederation for an Independent Poland, a smallanti-Communist group that has been politically active for a decade,won three council seats in the city of Lublin, one in Katowice and12 in Lodz. But Leszek Moczulski, the leader of the group, lost hisrace in Warsaw.   Residents of Gdansk province also voted on a referendum on theconstruction of a nuclear power plant in Zarnowiec, the PAP newsagency reported today. It said 80 percent of the voters wereagainst the project.</TEXT></DOC>
