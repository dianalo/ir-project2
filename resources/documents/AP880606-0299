DRISCOLL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   The hot, dry weather scorching the Midwest sent grain and soybeanfutures prices surging Monday by the maximum amount permitted for asingle day on the Chicago Board of Trade.   Soybeans advanced by the daily limit of 30 cents a bushel for thesecond consecutive session, bringing the July contract to $8.79, thehighest level in four years.   All six major agricultural futures on the Board of Trade were upthe limit for the first time in a decade or more, the exchange said.   On other markets, live cattle and pork futures moved sharplyhigher, cotton was up the limit, coffee advanced and energy futuresdeclined.   With the continuing lack of moisture in the Midwest, soybeanshave gained $1.11 a bushel in the past week.   ``It's a ferocious weather market,'' said trader VictorLespinasse with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.   And not much improvement is in sight. After the close of tradingMonday, the National Weather Service released its 6- to 10-dayforecast, predicting continued warm and dry conditions.   Lespinasse said tens of thousands of buy orders languished at theBoard of Trade, with only few sellers surfacing. The expectationswere for sharp price advances again on Tuesday.   Because of two consecutive sessions with limit gains, dailytrading limits are expanded on Tuesday to 45 cents a bushel forbeans, 15 cents a bushel for corn and oats and $15 a ton for meal.   Wheat settled 20 cents higher with the contract for delivery inJuly at $3.82} a bushel; corn was 10 cents higher with July at$2.44{ a bushel; oats were 10 cents higher with July at $2.06{ abushel; and soybeans were 30 cents higher with July at $8.79 cents abushel.   The sharp rise in grains and beans was felt in other markets, aswell. Live cattle and pork futures posted sharp gains at the ChicagoMercantile Exchange, while most cotton contracts were up the limitat the Cotton Exchange in New York.   ``The limit up grain prices had a lot to do with supporting thedistant deliveries (of cattle),'' said Philip Stanley, an analystwith Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.   He said the hot weather gave a direct boost to the nearbycontracts of cattle and hogs because of a reluctance to move theanimals to market in the heat.   ``And there may be some liquidation of the (cattle) breeding herdand of sows,'' he said. Higher grain prices mean more expensive feedand lower profits.   Live cattle were .57 cent to the limit 1.50 cents higher with theJune contract at 73.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .80 centlower to .15 cent higher with August at 75.17 cents a pound; livehogs were .50 cent to the limit 1.50 cents higher with June at 52.95cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .57 cent to 1.85 centshigher with July at 56.12 cents a pound.   Cotton futures prices rose the limit, continuing a trend of thatcommodity following soybean prices, said Ernest Simon, cottonspecialist with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   ``It doesn't make any sense since we have absolutely no problemwith cotton. There's no (weather) stress; it's too early,'' he said.   Cotton settled 1.96 to the limit 2 cents higher with July at68.34 cents a pound.   A light frost in Brazilian coffee growing regions sent futureshigher on the Coffee Exchange in New York.   ``The uncertainty of how much damage was done, if any, keptprices firm much of the day,'' said Sandra Kaul, an analyst in NewYork with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   The buds on the 1989-90 crop are beginning to develop and a frostcan make them drop off, she said, adding however, that most budswon't form until after mid-June.   Coffee settled 1.32 cents to 2.57 cents higher with July at137.47 cents a pound.   Energy futures tumbled on the New York Mercantile Exchange, ledby sharp losses in gasoline and heating oil.   Most of the weakness was due to technical market factors, saidPeter Beutel, an analyst in New York with Elders Futures Inc.   Also, he said, there not much expectation that OPEC willaccomplish anything constructive at its ministerial meeting Saturdayin Vienna.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 24 cents to 39 centslower with July at $17.26 a barrel; heating oil was 1.03 cents to1.29 cents lower with July at 45.84 cents a gallon; and unleadedgasoline was 1.04 cents to 1.16 cents lower with July at 49.73 centsa gallon.   Precious metals futures were mixed on the Commodity Exchange inNew York.   Gold settled $1.00 to $1.90 lower with the June contract at$462.90 a troy ounce; and silver was 4.4 cents to 4.5 cents higherwith June at $7.27 a troy ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
