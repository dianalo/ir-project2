The plan is expected to claim savings of $30 billion or less in fiscal 1988, which began Oct. 1, and as much as $45 billion the following year. It would raise taxes by $9 billion in fiscal 1988, or $1 billion less than had been previously discussed, and by a somewhat larger amount in fiscal 1989. The plan wouldn't touch cost-of-living increases for federal pension programs, including Social Security.    Faced with a quickly approaching Friday deadline for automatic, across-the-board cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law, the negotiators scraped together whatever odds and ends they could find, in order to meet the deficit-cutting targets. The turbulent financial markets were watching the approach of the deadline with increasing impatience.    The participants had to choose &quot;between doing a bold package of deficit reduction or simply avoiding sequestration,&quot; which is the technical term for the automatic cuts, said Rep. Leon Panetta (D., Calif.). &quot;And we're in the avoid-sequestration mode.&quot;    &quot;It's not a terribly hard package,&quot; said Rep. Pat Williams (D., Mont.). &quot;There's not a significant amount of pain in it.&quot;    The talks between White House and congressional negotiators were begun more than three weeks ago to devise a package of deficit reductions that would avert the $23 billion in automatic cuts that are to go into effect Friday.    &quot;It's everybody's sense that after 3 1/2 weeks, we should be at the bottom line,&quot; Rep. Panetta said. &quot;We don't frankly have the convenience of additional time, we're at the wall.&quot;    In the meantime, lawmakers began to prepare for an effort to postpone the automatic Gramm-Rudman cuts. They said there isn't enough time to piece together the substantive legislation to enact the agreement before the Friday deadline.    The package being discussed now would produce about $25 billion in savings that could be counted for the purposes of the Gramm-Rudman law, which would be just enough to avert the automatic reductions. Additional savings of about $5 billion would be claimed from a refinancing of loans by the Rural Electrification Administration, but it is a one-time savings that would produce a loss to the government in the longer term.    Hopes of achieving $5 billion in savings from entitlement programs ended when the participants agreed -- with apparent finality -- not to tamper with cost-of-living adjustments for a variety of programs, the largest of which is Social Security.    The negotiators are now trying for closer to $4 billion in cuts in entitlement programs, which provide benefits under requirements established by law, but still hadn't reached that lower goal when talks ended last night. They have tentatively agreed to savings in student-loan programs, and to restrict pay raises for federal workers to 2%. That money would come out of federal agencies' existing funds.    Today, the budget negotiators are to begin drafting a statement of principles to deal with some issues outstanding. One is a method for ensuring that the proposed savings are actually reached through substantive changes in law, and another is to ensure that they are achieved both in the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, and next year.    The plan would hold down annually appropriated accounts for both fiscal years. Savings from military programs would be about $4.9 billion from projected levels in the current fiscal year. Savings in nonmilitary programs would total about $2.6 billion, including about $600 million from foreign aid.    Additional savings are expected to come from such areas as user fees, and changes in loan programs.    Top tax writers in Congress still must decide how to proceed with the tax legislation. The two chairmen of the tax-writing panels could possibly meet with Treasury Secretary James Baker to resolve that thorny issue. The increases aren't likely to include income-tax changes or a gasoline tax.    Besides moving toward agreement on the outlines of a package, budget negotiators also began focusing on the need to postpone the automatic spending cuts. They acknowledged that even with an agreement, there isn't enough time to enact those budget savings and tax increases by the Friday deadline.    The result is a consensus that congressional leaders will ask both chambers to postpone the automatic cuts until after Thanksgiving, if the negotiators reach an accord in the next couple of days. &quot;If we get an agreement in principle, we then might have to ask for a delay for a few days,&quot; said House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas).    The automatic cuts could be postponed if both chambers vote an extension and the president signs it before the end of the day Friday. Lawmakers agreed that such a delay depends on the negotiators adopting the outlines of a budget compromise.    But some conservatives said they might decide not to delay the Gramm-Rudman cuts, given the shape of the accord that the negotiators are now working to complete. They said they worry that the package might not contain enough spending cuts in nonmilitary programs, and they said they need assurances that the plan's cuts will be realized.    &quot;If it's just papers and cosmetics, I don't think an extension will occur,&quot; said Sen. Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.). He and other conservatives said they might vote instead for a proposal by Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R., Kan.) to freeze spending across the board for one year.    Mr. Baker gave an impassioned pitch to Senate Republicans yesterday to stand behind any deal that would prevent the Gramm-Rudman cuts. But a faction of conservatives, which is particularly strong in the House, is beginning to talk openly about preferring the automatic cuts over any negotiated package.    &quot;Maybe we should have&quot; the automatic cuts, said House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois. &quot;It would wake some people up. It's a jolt and a jar.&quot; Rep. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the second-ranking Republican in the House, added that the Gramm-Rudman cuts with some tax increases are &quot;looking better every day.&quot;    The Friday deadline is, in fact, not as critical as it appears. Administration budget officials said the across-the-board cuts don't become final until Congress has enacted appropriations for the remainder of the current fiscal year. That enactment isn't expected until later next month. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater hinted at some flexibility yesterday, when he told reporters that the deadline isn't &quot;legally imposed.&quot;    But whatever the technical details, a failure to reach agreement by Friday could seriously affect the financial markets. The high-level talks began three weeks ago in response to the stock-market crash. And negotiators, who are trying to reassure investors that politicians here can put aside their differences and govern effectively, remain under pressure to reach an agreement.    Markets in the U.S. and abroad sagged yesterday under the weight of uncertainty about deficit-cutting prospects. The dollar fell 1.4% against the West German mark and 1.2% against the Japanese yen, erasing the gains it had made Monday on a rally that had been fueled by promising news on the deficit-cutting front.    Stocks and bonds also fell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed more than 50 points early in the session and remained at that level until the final hour when bargain hunters trimmed the loss to 26.85 points, for a close of 1922.25. Bond prices drifted slightly lower yesterday in dull trading. </TEXT></DOC>
