 In the coming years, what appear to be pitched battles nowmay seem like mere skirmishes, for as the popularity of the graphics programsand graphical user interfaces grows, PC users' appetite for mice can onlyincrease.andM;Five years ago the situation was quite different.andP;  Mouse marketers wereforced to play a missionary--rather than a military--role, since mice had tocompete against tablets, trackballs, touch screens, and light pens forcontrol over a paltry number of graphics-based programs on the personalcomputer.andM;Although all of these alternate-input devices still have their devotees, themouse is now clearly supported by the largest and widest variety ofapplications.andP;  This evolution can be traced to three factors: the AppleMacintosh; the rising popularity and usability of graphics programs such asthose for desktop publishing, CAD, drawing, and painting; and the fact thatmost graphics and graphical user interface vendors have opted to support themouse.andM;Despite this growing acceptance of the mouse's usefulness, of the 32 millionPCs at work today, only 7 million are equipped with mice.andP;  Richard Able,market manager for Microsoft's mouse, attributes today's low numbers to thelarge base of 8088 systems: &quot;Graphics interfaces are too slow on the 8088.andO;As buyers move to 286- and 386-based systems to run the new software, they'llfind they need a mouse.&quot;andP;  IBM's official blessing of the mouse, giving it aport on the PS/2, can only make it grow more popular.andM;WORD OF MOUSEandM;All of this excitement centers on a simple device that translates hand motioninto cursor motion.andP;  There are four ways to make this translation:andM;* Most mice use a rolling ball to create and track motion.andP;  Inside thesemechanical mice the ball turns two rollers at right angles--one for verticalmotion, the other for horizontal.andP;  The rollers drive mechanical encoders thatsend signals to the PC, where software translates those signals into cursormotion.andM;* Optomechanical mice work on the same principle as mechanical mice, but therollers are connected to optical encoders that use light instead ofmechanical contacts to send signals.andM;* Wheel mice sidestep the rolling ball completely by using plastic wheels,placed at right angles, to drive the encoders directly.andM;* Optical mice work with a special pad containing a reflective grid of blackand blue lines.andP;  As the mouse moves over the pad, photosensors inside it readthe blue-and-black pattern and send that pattern to the PC to move thecursor.andM;Mouse mechanics don't make much difference anymore, though they once did.andP;  Asa result, marketers are now trying to set themselves apart by focusingattention on mouse resolution.andM;A mouse's resolution is based on the sensitivity of its tracking system.andO;Whenever the mouse detects any change in motion, it sends signals to thecomputer, where they are onverted into screen motion.andP;  The resolution isbased on the smallest change in motion the mouse can detect and is expressedin dots per inch (dpi).andP;  A 200-dpi mouse can detect changes in motion assmall as 1/200th of an inch, so for each inch that you move the mouse, thecursor moves 200 dots (pixels) on the screen.andP;  You can cover most of an EGAscreen (640 by 350 pixels) in a 3- by 2-inch area with a 200-dpi-resolutionmouse.andP;  Logitech's HiRez Mouse, at 320 dpi, reduces this area to 2 by 1inches.andM;However, because of the 1:1 motion-sensing to pixel-movement relationship,the higher the resolution of your monitor, the more you have to move yourmouse.andP;  A 200-dpi mouse needs an area 6 by 4 inches to cover a 1,200 by800-pixel resolution monitor.andP;  That's major real estate on most desks, somouse manufacturers developed &quot;dynamic tracking&quot; (sometimes called &quot;ballistictracking&quot;) to cover the screen in a smaller area.andM;Dynamic tracking lets you increase the number of pixels you move for eachincrement of mouse motion.andP;  Triggered by sudden mouse movements, dynamictracking increases the cursor movement ratio, usually to a value set by theuser.andP;  For example, if you select a 1:5 dynamic ratio, the screen cursormoves five times the distance the mouse moves.andP;  With a 200-dpi mouse and 1:5dynamic tracking, 1 square inch of mouse motion covers 1,000 pixels.andP;  Mousevendors let you change tracking ratios in different ways--some only to fixedratio values, others to ratio values that you set using the command line or abatch file.andM;BUTTONS AND CASESandM;In our last comprehensive mouse survey (&quot;Mice for Mainstream Applications,&quot;PC Magazine, August 1987) 11 of the 15 mice had three buttons.andP;  This year 8of the 17 mice reviewed have two buttons.andP;  The tide seems to be shifting; itseems that-- following the Microsoft Windows lead--the bulk of mouse-drivenapplications just don't require users to make more than three choices withtheir mice.andM;The other major trend is case design.andP;  Microsoft's new mouse raised ergonomicarguments to new heights and set a standard that others try to follow.andP;  Someof the mice we reviewed look as if they were designed in wind tunnels, but inpractical tests only a few shapes stood out as favorites.andP;  Case design fallsinto that &quot;heart and mind&quot; category: you're certain to develop your ownpreferences.andM;We have reviewed 17 mice marketed by 11 vendors, including DexxaInternational, IBM, IMSI, Key Tronic, KYE International, Logitech, Microsoft,Mitsubishi, MSC Technologies (formerly Mouse Systems), Numonics, and Z-Nix.andO;Microsoft remains the leader and trendsetter in the competition, with over 40percent of total mouse sales.andP;  But Key Tronic, Logitech, and MSC Technologiesare significant contenders, and new players are queuing up in noteworthystyle for a share of this lucrative market.andM;A NEW LOOK FOR THE LOGITECH MOUSEandM;Finally, the company known for having the best price/performance ratio hasembraced ergonomics.andP;  Though Logitech's rationale was that cosmetics are nomatch for superior technology, let's face it: besides being unattractive,Logitech's flat wedge case was never very comfortable.andP;  But the $ 129 mousethat the company plans to introduce this month should push it to the front ofthe pack.andP;  In addition to a newly designed, comfortable case, the betaversion of this new mouse features high resolution and dynamic trackingcapabilities.andM;Logitech could have gotten by with the new case design and just left it atthat, but it didn't.andP;  The company's new mouse has ergonomics and technology.andO;The case design is a smooth arc 1-inch high, with three flush-mounted buttonsspaced evenly across the forward surface.andP;  The buttons have feather-touchresponse, and there's a slight depression on the center button for tactilefeedback.andP;  Logitech also moved the tracking ball forward to improvepositioning control.andM;The relationship between the case design and resolution are worth noting.andO;With the arc case design your fingers drape naturally over the mouse, so youtend to control it with your fingers rather than with your palm.andP;  This fingercontrol is enhanced by a respectable 320-dot-per-inch resolution andon-the-fly dynamic tracking.andM;COMFORTABLE CONTROLandM;You can work in a generous area of the screen with little hand motion,traversing its length with a flick of the wrist.andP;  I found the Logitech Mouseone of the most comfortable to use for extended periods.andP;  It performed wellin EGA or VGA mode and really showed off on high-resolution monitors like theWyse WY-700.andP;  Throughout testing, the mouse's control and positioningaccuracy were exceptional, and its button response was sharp and solid.andM;Logitech may have given in to ergonomics, but the company is maintaining itsturf with distinctive, and often desirable, features.andP;  Other mousemanufacturers shun the three-button design; Logitech embraces it.andO;Menu-generating software is optional with many mice; Logitech includes it.andO;Other mice require PS/2 interfaces; Logitech is plug compatible.andP;  And so on.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
