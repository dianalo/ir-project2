But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``generallyspeaking, we have not found sanctions productive and have viewedadditional sanctions as being counter-productive.''   Fitzwater also confirmed reports that F.W. de Klerk, the leaderof South Africa's National Party who is expected to becomepresident later this year, would visit the United States. He willmeet with Secretary of State James Baker, but not with Bush,Fitzwater said. De Klerk would be the first major South Africanofficial to visit here in about 30 years.   Also, administration officials said veteran diplomat WilliamSwing is expected to be named ambassador to South Africa. Swing,54, has previously served as ambassador to the Congo and Liberia.   The White House said Bush had managed to surmount schedulingproblems and would meet with the South African anti-apartheiddelegation early Thursday.   The group had asked for the meeting one month ago, but untilWednesday afternoon the White House said it was having troublefinding time. Nobel Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu warnedthat ``a non-meeting would be a very significant signal'' againstthe anti-apartheid movement. Senators Edward Kennedy and Paul Simonboth urged Bush Wednesday to meet with the group.   Tutu said he had met with Baker recently and felt the new U.S.administration was ``less doctrinaire'' in its approach towardSouth Africa than the previous one.   Tutu met with former President Reagan in 1984 but he latercalled him a ``racist pure and simple'' over the former president'sdecision to veto an economic sanctions bill passed by Congress in1986. Congress overrode the veto but the Reagan administrationimplemented the sanctions reluctantly and incompletely.   Tutu, along with The Reverends Allan Boesak and Beyers Naude,came to the United States to launch a campaign for reviving thestalled attempts to legislate additional punitive trade sanctionson South Africa. They attended a forum with some 80 lawmakers,governors, academics and businessmen in the ornate Senate CaucusRoom to discuss their plans.   Simon conceded the new sanctions bill would face a tough fightin the Senate, where Republicans have threatened to block themeasure with a fillibuster, but pledged to push on with hisefforts. He called Bush's agreement to meet with the group anencouraging sign.   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, one of several Republicans whoattended the forum, urged Bush to ``make a show of good faithpublicly'' in committing his administration to a campaign to endapartheid.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he wasencouraged by the openness of the Bush administration as signaledby the presence of Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen at thegathering. Mitchell said Congress and the administration ``agreeupon the end _ abolition of apartheid. We must now reach agreementon the means.''   Kennedy, saying the fight against apartheid has become ``thegreatest human rights struggle of our time,'' urged the Bushadministration to work together with Congress on a new strategytoward South Africa.   The South African group argued that without sanctions, theirgovernment would not have any incentive to negotiate with thecountry's 28 million blacks who make up 85 percent of thepopulation. They contended that it was the country's economicstraits _ including inflation, unemployment and a heavy foreigndebt _ that caused the government to agree last year to grantindependence to Namibia and end its occupation of the territory.   Specifically, the group suggested targeting the coal, oil anddiamond mining industries for punitive measures as a way oftightening the screws on South Africa. It also urged the UnitedStates to lead an international sanctions campaign against SouthAfrica.</TEXT></DOC>
