This rule amends a number of List entries in the categoriesof metal-working machinery; electrical and power-generating equipment;general industrial equipment; transportation equipment; metals, mineralsand their manufactures; chemicals, metalloids, petroleum products and relatedmaterials; and rubber and rubber products. In addition, export controlson software related to certain of these commodities are added to Part 379,the technical data portion of the Export Administration Regulations.Amendments to the multilaterally controlled entries on the CCL (specifically,those Export Control Commodity Numbers (ECCNs) that end with ``A'') havedirectly resulted from a review of strategic controls maintained by theU.S. and certain allied countries through the Coordinating Committee (COCOM).ECCN 4460B is being removed by this rule since the aero-engines describedtherein are covered by 1460A, and parts and accessories thereof that areof national security concern are covered by ECCNs 1460A, 1746A, 1749A and1763A. Such multilateral controls restrict the availability of strategicitems to controlled countries. With the concurrence of the Department ofDefense, the Department of Commerce has determined that these revisionsto the CCL are necessary to protect U.S. National security interests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>September 14, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>For questions of a technical natureon equipment for the manufacture or testing of electronic components andmaterials (ECCN 1355A), call Robert Anstead, Electronic Components TechnologyCenter, Bureau of Export Administration, Telephone: (202) 377-11641.For questions of a technical nature on general industrial equipment, callSurendra Dhir, Capital Goods, Technology Center, Bureau of Export Administration,Telephone: (202) 377-8550.For questions of a technical nature on transportation equipment, call BruceWebb, Capital Goods Technology Center, Bureau of Export Administration,Telephone: (202) 377-3806.For questions of a technical nature on chemicals and materials, call JeffreyTripp, Capital Goods Technology Center, Bureau of Export Administration,Telephone: (202) 377-5695.For questions of a technical nature on synthetic rubber (ECCN 1801), callJim Seevaratnam, Capital Goods Technology Center, Bureau of Export Administration,Telephone: (202) 377-5695.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>.<ITAG tagnum="84">Saving Clause</ITAG>Shipments of items removed from general license authorizations as a resultof this regulation that were on dock for lading, on lighter, laden aboardan exporting carrier, or en route aboard a carrier to a port of exportpursuant to actual orders for export before September 28, 1988 may be exportedunder the general license provisions up to and including October 12, 1988.Any such items not actually exported before midnight October 12, 1988 requirea validated export license.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements.</ITAG>1. Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared.2. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule also is exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EEA does notrequire that this rule be published in proposed form because this ruleimplements regulatory changes based on COCOM review. Further, no otherlaw requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity forpublic comment be given for this rule.3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.4. This rule mentions collections of information subject to the requirementsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). These collections have been approved by the Office ofManagement and Budget under control numbers 0625-001 and 0625-0140.5. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.Accordingly, it is being issued in final form. However, as with other Departmentof Commerce rules, comments from the public are always welcome.
