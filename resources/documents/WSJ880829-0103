The 12% debentures due in 1995 are part of a $75 million financing that also includes $60 million of senior debt placed through Bankers Trust Co. to be used to pay existing debt. The Pennzoil funds will be used to hasten conversion of some of the 1,500 independent quick-lube operations using Pennzoil products to Jiffy Lube outlets. The financing is the latest of arrangements tying cash-short Jiffy Lube to cash-rich Pennzoil. Jiffy Lube's chairman and chief executive officer, W.J. Hindman, said the Pennzoil alliance &quot;is the most significant event in this company's history. It strongly positions us for continued growth.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
