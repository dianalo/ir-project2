WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government ismired in the biggest controversy of his six-year leadership overallegations that West German companies helped Libya build a chemicalplant that can produce poison gas.   Even members of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union say privatelyhe has bungled the issue and threatened the party's popularity bydodging the question of whether he or his Cabinet members ignoredearly reports of a German hand in the Libyan project.   Kohl's chief aide is to appear before Parliament on Wednesday todisclose new information about U.S. accusations that West Germanfirms took part in the Libyan project by selling materials inviolation of export controls.   West Germany's opposition Social Democratic Party, demanding the``whole truth'' be told, accused Kohl of inflicting lasting damageto the nation's image and to relations with the United States. Theleft-wing Greens Party called on the chancellor to resign.   ``We're making complete fools of ourselves,'' commented agovernment official from the Christian Democrats, speaking oncondition of anonymity. ``The chancellor must extricate thegovernment from this controversy before the damage becomesirreparable.''   Kohl has been silent on the subject since Thursday, when heacknowledged during a TV interview there were ``growingindications'' of West German involvement in the Libyan affair.   After several denials of government involvement, Kohl'sspokesman, Friedhelm Ost, refused to say Tuesday whether Bonn nowaccepts U.S. claims that the plant near Tripoli is capable ofproducing chemical weapons.   ``We have no new information on this,'' Ost told reporters.   But on Monday, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg toldreporters the government now has ``concrete indications'' andintelligence reports that make clear the plant in Rabta, southeastof the Libyan capital, can produce chemical weapons.   ``We must assume that the factory is a facility in which poisongas can be produced,'' Stoltenberg said at a news conference.   Finance Ministry spokesman Karl-Heinz von den Driesch, sittingthree seats away from Ost at the conference, said Stoltenberg hadinformation from a trip to the United States last week that had notbeen seen by officials in Bonn.   Ost said the government's position would be explained onWednesday, when the chancellor's chief of staff, Wolfgang Schaeuble,informs the Bundestag about what it knows of West German involvement.   Opposition parties have and pressed the chancellor to clarify towhat degree West German firms have been involved, including onecompany owned by the federal government.   National newspapers have been critical of Kohl's handling of theaffair, describing the government as defensive in its stubbornrefrain that it has collected no evidence that would justifycriminal charges against any German companies.   Munich's Sueddeutsche Zeitung commented Tuesday that Kohl hadlost political control of the affair by evading action and suggestedthe government at least ask federal prosecutors to decide if chargesare in order.   Social Democratic Party leader Hans-Jochen Vogel accused Kohl ofpersonal responsibility for a situation in which ``the German peopleand the world public have long been decieved, that German-Americanrelations have been seriously hampered and that West Germany hasbeen exposed to worldwide suspicion of calling publicly for a ban onchemical weapons while secretly fostering their production.''   Petra Kelly, leader of the Greens party's parliamentarydelegation, demanded that Kohl resign over the government'smishandling of the issue.   Ost told reporters in early January that the government learnedof U.S. claims that West German firms helped build the Libyan plantduring Kohl's Nov. 15 visit to Washington.   Eight days later, after West German media claimed intelligencesources had informed the chancellor's office as long ago as 1986 ofapparent complicity, Ost corrected himself to say the first wordKohl got of the affair came in mid-October.   Stoltenberg said Monday that his office learned of ``vague''indications in August, and Ost confirmed Tuesday that anintelligence report had been made to the government on Aug. 2.   What is seen by Americans as foot-dragging by Bonn poses apotential threat to the strong position Kohl's party has in WestGerman politics.   If West German firms are found to have broken the law Kohl'sgovernment could appear to have tried to cover up for the companies,or been slow to follow up on the American intelligence reports.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Carol J.
