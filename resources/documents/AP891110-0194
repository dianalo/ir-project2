Britain's independent nuclear deterrent could not be submittedas a bargaining factor at East-West disarmament talks ``for theforeseeable future,'' he said in the interview with the domesticBritish news agency Press Association.   Repeating what Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has said onprevious occasions, King stressed that Britain and NATO needed tomaintain their guard against Soviet-led Warsaw Pact forces and saidhe believed the British public would understand this, PA reported.   It said he also pointed to difficulties being faced at East-Westtalks on conventional arms reductions in Vienna and warned therewas a considerable way to go in this area.   Britain and France are the only two West European nations whohave their own nuclear forces independent of the the North AtlanticTreaty Organization's nuclear arsenal.   Britain plans to update its ageing submarine-borne Polarisnuclear missiles by the mid-1990s with a more powerful Tridentsystem bought from the United States.   PA quoted King as saying: ``It is true the present tremendouschanges might make some people think we don't need defense anymore. But it is a very human emotion to see your own countryproperly defended.''   He said events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union werehappening fast and it was impossible to predict how they would turnout, PA reported.   It quoted him as saying progress had been achieved bymaintaining strong defenses to ensure that freedom in the West wasnot overwhelmed by communist pressures and intimidation.   ``By being prepared to maintain strong defenses, we have seenthis opportunity for improvement. The one thing which would belunacy and almost criminal would be just at this moment to changeour approach which could damage this process of reform,'' PAreported him as saying.   ``We must keep our defenses strong but respond in a positive andconstructive way to the approaches from the Soviet Union and theWarsaw Pact.''   PA said the interview by its defense correspondent CharlesMiller was conducted in London Thursday.   Britain's opposition Labor Party this year shed its vote-losingpolicy of unilateral nuclear disarmament in favor of amultilateralist stance. Under this, a Labor government would onlyscrap Britain's independent nuclear force in a negotiated armscontrol deal.   Political analysts say Labor's defense policy change is a mainreason for the current surge in the party's fortunes. Labor haslost three successive elections to Mrs. Thatcher's governingConservative Party since 1979 but now leads the Conservatives by upto 12 points in opinion polls.   Mrs. Thatcher said Labor's new defense policy was merely a formof words to see the party through the next general election, due bymid-1992.</TEXT></DOC>
