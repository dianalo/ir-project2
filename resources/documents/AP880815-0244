Thepotential seems enormous. So, to some at least, is the risk ofunexpected consequences. That's what a determined crusader hasfocused on, to much controversy.</TEXT><BYLINE>By NANCY SHULINS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A scientist sprays genetically alteredbacteria onto a strawberry patch. A mouse with a man-madepredisposition to breast cancer scurries about a university lab. Apig with a human growth hormone gene grows bigger and faster thanits brother. Many cheer. Others worry.   For some, genetic manipulation threatens deeply held religiousbeliefs. For others, it's the thought of mutant organisms run amok.For still others, fresh images of disaster _ the orange flames ofChernobyl, the forked tongue of smoke from the Challenger _ cloudthe promise of bright technological frontiers.   In courtrooms and congressional hearings, in the media and oncollege campuses, the man who speaks most fervently to suchuneasiness is Jeremy Rifkin, biotechnology's leading gadfly. He isnot widely revered among scientists.   ``In the Industrial Age, our parents didn't ask questions. Itwas the age of progress and efficiency, and there were no limits,''Rifkin says. ``Scientists said `trust us.' Industrialists werehellbent on change, i.e. profits. Policy leaders were wildlyenthused. There was a utopian mentality.   ``A child believes there are no consequences for his acts. We'vehad a childlike consciousness. Now, with the new scientifictechnology, the changes are so impactful we can't afford thatchildlike mentality. It's time to raise fundamental questions.''   He speaks quickly, a rush of words barely audible over the droneof a copier, the lone concession to electronics in the otherwiseresolutely low-tech office of the Foundation on Economic Trends.   The outer room, crammed with young interns and old chairs,resembles the headquarters for an embattled political campaign. Ina sense, it is.   From this modest command post, a handful of lawyers, policyresearchers and interns fire shots sometimes heard round thenation. They aim at all manner of targets: Genetic engineering.Animal patenting. Commercialized childbearing. Bovine growthhormone. Biological warfare.   Rifkin, the foundation's president, is 43, a small man trim fromyears of swimming a mile every night at the Y. His brown eyesradiate warmth and good humor; the vision of a civilization bent onengineering its own demise is a burden that rests on him lightly,at least outwardly.   He has no shortage of critics among scientists, who dismiss hisarguments as unscientific and his writing as anti-intellectual.Opponents stress Rifkin's lack of credentials _ he's had no formalscience training _ and describe him as a nuisance. But a fewconcede that, along with their blood pressure, he also raises someimportant points.   His talent lies in bringing prominent people together inalliances such as the National Coalition Against Surrogacy,composed of feminists, lawyers and 17 former surrogates includingMary Beth Whitehead-Gould, to hold news conferences, testify beforeCongress, and generally stir up the public.   Other foundation staffers specialize in lawsuits such as the1984 action that has delayed construction of a Department ofDefense germ warfare laboratory at the Dugway Proving Ground inUtah. The Army's considering scaling down the proposed facility orputting it elsewhere, among other choices.   They also circulate petitions, such as the June 13 request toPostmaster General Anthony Frank to halt the Army's longstandingpractice of shipping deadly experimental viruses through the mail.Frank concurred.   A 1983 lawsuit by Rifkin's organization stalled tests of afrost-inhibiting microbe on the West Coast for four years before astate court of appeals judge finally gave the go-ahead.   Another suit prompted the federal Environmental ProtectionAgency to deny a permit to Monsanto for a test of a gene-alteredmicrobial corn pesticide. Monsanto eventually abandoned the project.   Last May, the Defense Department agreed to curtail testing atelectromagnetic pulse simulator facilities in Virginia, Alabama andNew Mexico until environmental, health and safety matters can bedocumented. EMPs are electromagnetic pulses that travel at speedsof light to simulate those generated by high-altitude nuclearexplosions. The agreement came in response to another Rifkin suitcharging potential environmental and human health risks.   Rifkin's foundation was also instrumental in exposing twobiotech cases involving violations. One concerned a Californiacompany that conducted outdoor tests of a genetically engineeredchemical before receiving a permit. The EPA accused the company,Advanced Genetic Sciences, of falsifying the data to indicate thetests had taken place indoors.   In the other, the Department of Agriculture's Animal and PlantHealth Inspection Service, without first consulting otherregulatory agencies, allowed Biologics Corp. of Omaha, Neb., totest and market a genetically altered vaccine for pigs. The NewYork Times in an editorial called the foundation ``an unrelentingwatchdog of genetic engineering'' that ``deserves credit forbringing to light these two cases and what they show about theragged federal system for regulating the new technology.''   Not all Rifkin campaigns succeed. Two recent suits challenginggovernment regulation of genetic engineering were dismissed by aU.S. District judge who ruled it had no legal standing to sue.   A genetically engineered mouse can still be patented the same asa mousetrap, although legislation has been introduced in Congresscalling for moratoriums on animal patenting.   Deliberate environmental releases of various geneticallyengineered viruses and bacteria are planned over the next severalyears.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
