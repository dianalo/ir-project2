<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-46-0265 </DOCNO><TEXT>The ECHO-6 sounding rocket was launched from the Poke Flat Research Range,Alaska on 30 March 1983. A Terrier-Black Brant launch vehicle carriedthe payload on a northward trajectory over an auroral arc and to an apogeeof 216 kilometers. The primary objective of the ECHO-6 experiment wasto evaluate electric fields, magnetic fields, and plasma processes inthe distant magnetosphere by injecting electron beams in the ionosphereand observing conjugate echoes. The experiment succeeded in injection10-36 keV beams during the existence of a moderate growth-phase aurora,an easterly electrojet system, and a pre-midnight inflation conditionof the magnetosphere. The ECHO-6 payload system consisted of an acceleratorMAIN payload, a free-flying Plasma Diagnostics Package (PDP), and fourrocket-propelled Throw Away Detectors (TADs). The PDP was ejected fromthe MAIN payload to analyze electric fields, plasma particles, energeticelectrons, and photometric effects produced by beam injections. The TADswere ejected from the MAIN payload in a pattern to detect echoes in theconjugate echo region south of the beam-emitting MAIN payload. The TADsreached distances exceeding 3 kilometers from the MAIN payload and mademeasurements of the ambient electrons by means of solid-state detectorsand electrostatic analyzers.</TEXT></DOC>
