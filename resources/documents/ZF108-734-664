 The starter kit withEthernet hardware sells for $725.andP;  The Adapter Independent NOS sells for$495.andM;Description: LANtastic is a peer-to-peer network that allows all computers torun as either servers or workstations sharing serial and parallel devices aswell as files.andP;  Security includes user passwords and access privileges.andO;Electronic mail, on-line chat, and print spooling provided.andP;  The NOS usesabout 20KB for workstations and 50KB for servers.andP;  With Artisoft Ethernetadapters rather than their proprietary adapters, about 10KB of additionalmemory is used.andM;Requirements: Supports PC, XT, AT, PS/2, and 386 compatibles.andP;  To act as aserver, computers must have at least 512KB of RAM.andP;  DOS 3.1 and above aresupported.andM;LANtastic Voice AdapterandM;ArtisoftandM;Price: Adapter card with handset sells for $149.andM;Description: In conjunction with the LANtastic NOS, the voice adapter cardallows you to send verbal electronic mail to other network users or initiatea verbal chat via the network with one other network user.andM;Requirements: PC, XT, AT, and 386-based computers are supported.andP;  Aneight-bit expansion slot is required.andP;  Also supports RCA-type audio jacksfound on some speakers.andM;What You Need to KnowandM;LANtastic NOSandM;ArtisoftandM;Installation: The proprietary adapter cards are simple to install--justselect the I/O address and put them in the computer.andP;  Other options areautomatically selected by the software.andP;  Installing the software is equallyeasy--the installation script prompts for destination drive and directory andoffers to set up the system with default values.andM;Documentation: I found it odd that the startup kit would come with twoadapters but only one manual.andP;  Aside from this oversight, the documentationgoes to great effort to be thorough, but falls short in some areas and has apoor index.andM;Ease of use: The system offers a menu interface that is easy to learn.andP;  Theability to copy network user information from one system to another wouldmake maintaining the network easier for systems with multiple servers.andP;  Theability to run all network management functions directly from the server orworkstations simplifies maintenance.andP;  &quot;Indirect files&quot; can be used to makethe network all but transparent to users.andM;LANtastic Voice AdapterandM;ArtisoftandM;Installation: The hardware plugs in without requiring any configurationunless one of the DMA channels it will use is unavailable.andP;  The software isstandard with LANtastic so requires no additional installation orconfiguration steps.andM;Documentation: Brief.andP;  Only hardware specific documentation is included withthe board itself; the application documentation is part of the LANtasticmanual.andM;Ease of use: Easier to use than some telephone systems.andM;What You Really Want to KnowandM;LANtastic NOSandM;ArtisoftandM;Robustness/compatibility: No apparent problems with the applications testedunder than Procomm Plus.andP;  Communications programs like Procomm must notaccess hardware directly or attempt to reserve the IRQ associated with agiven port, otherwise they will be incompatible.andM;Usefulness: A network is always more useful than no network for any locationwith multiple computers.andP;  As a peer-to-peer network with good security,LANtastic offers flexibility so users can configure a network specifically totheir needs.andM;LANtastic Voice AdapterandM;ArtisoftandM;Robustness/compatibility: No problems with the LANtastic applications, butnot compatible with voice messages from other systems.andP;  Compatibility oftelephone handset replacements depends on power requirements of replacement.andM;Usefulness: Current implementation has limited use, but as applicationsbecome available, you'll wonder why you ever thought you could do without it.andM;What do you get when you cross a network with voice mail?andP;  No, not ISDN, butthe LANtastic Network Operating System (NOS) with voice adapter support.andP;  TheNOS itself is well rounded, offering both peer-to-peer and, of course,dedicated server setups, e-mail, user-to-user chat, the standard disk andprinter sharing along with modem sharing, and security features for definingaccesses to any network resource.andP;  Adding a voice adapter, you can send voiceas well as textual e-mail, and chats can be conducted both through voice andtext.andM;Good ConnectionsandM;Peer-to-peer networks offer companies the option of having all computers actas servers.andP;  This often requires more sophisticated users than networks withdedicated servers require, but peer-to-peer networks are more flexible.andP;  If auser needs more frequent access to a resource but others may eventually needto use it as well, peer-to-peer networks allow the resource to reside withthe user most likely to be accessing it.andP;  Thus, networks without a dedicatedserver offer a bit more of the autonomy that caused users to originallyclamor for PCs.andP;  With a network like LANtastic, you can choose which fits agiven company, the autonomous, everyone's-a-server approach, or the approachthat leaves everyone subject to the same rules and restrictions of adedicated server.andM;To simplify matters for users on peer-to-peer networks (and for the systemadministrator of a dedicated server, for that matter) Artisoft offers an easyinstallation.andP;  The 2MB network adapter card driver has a /AUTO switch thatforces the software to configure itself according to the boards' DIP switchsettings and the IRQ and DMA channel the driver finds available in thesystem.andP;  The Ethernet adapter does not offer this option, but it has theadvantage of being NetWare compatible.andP;  With the Artisoft Ethernet boards,users who foresee their networks growing to a size that makes NetWare moreeffective can plan to upgrade to NetWare without worrying about new hardwareor cabling.andM;The software installation is equally easy.andP;  The installation program includesprompts with such through onscreen explanation, you won't need to look at thedocumentation.andM;The system's online help also offers a good amount of information and reducesthe need to rely on the documentation.andP;  I found myself turning to the onlinehelp when I couldn't locate the information I needed in the documentation.andO;Since the manual's index pointed me, in some cases, to pages that didn'tdiscuss the topic I was looking for (and since I couldn't find some topics atall), I looked for online help instead.andP;  During the installation, you havethe option to set up a default user with no password and configure the systemto share LPT1 and all disks.andP;  This is a good place to start.andP;  When I set upboth Compaq computers as servers, I specified the use of the defaultconfiguration.andP;  This familiarized me with the system before trying tocustomize it.andM;With NET_MGR, the network administrator (whether it be every user on thenetwork, a select group, or an individual) selects what resources each serverwill make available to the network.andP;  Printers, modems, or any serial orparallel device attached to LPT1-3 or COM1-2 can be shared with other networkusers.andP;  Since some applications write directly to hardware, they may notaccept the redirected services, but at least you can try.andP;  Using Procomm Plus1.1B--I did not manage to share modems--it always went to a local COM portand wreaked havoc on the network cards that were apparently trying to use thesame IRQ as the COM assigned to the network modem.andM;Any user that wishes to access a shared resource can configure his server orworkstation to replace a PRN, LPT, or COM device with a network device.andP;  Itdoesn't matter what device you choose to replace since the system does notcheck to make sure serial printers or even modems are not mapped to paralleldevices.andP;  This provides the user with added flexibility--at least fivedifferent serial printers could be accessed from any station on the network.andM;Disks, directories, even individual files may be shared as well.andP;  These canbe accessed through any drive lable not in use locally.andP;  For example, Iinstalled the Canon, which had only A: and B: floppy drives, so it wouldaccess a network drive whenever I specified C:.andP;  In addition to hard drives,I found specifying directories useful.andP;  That way, I provided a home directoryto users.andP;  Home directories offer a location on the server's hard drive inwhich users can access subdirectories but which does not provide a path todirectories a level above the user's home.andM;LANtastic's security measures include the ability to specify what level ofaccess users have to network functions such as the NET_MGR command and alsothe level of access to shared resources.andP;  For users' home directories, Iprovided complete access only to the individual whose home it was.andP;  Otherdirectories were available as common areas for everyone to share.andP;  Stillother directories were only available to the server's local user or thenetwork supervisor.andM;LANtastic does not offer support for groups; instead, it supports wildcards.andO;To set up privileges for all users, you may &quot;*&quot; rather than entering eachindividual user name.andP;  Like the DOS wildcard, it evaluates any string thatmay occur; &quot;*&quot; results in all users and &quot;B*&quot; results in all user namesbeginning with B.andP;  This allows you to set up user names with the samebeginning to indicate each group.andP;  Access levels may then be set by groups.andM;The managers of two groups could have user names beginning with &quot;A.&quot;andO;Managers can then be given the same access rights to resources through &quot;A*&quot;and access to the same resources as their groups by specifying &quot;A1*&quot; and&quot;A2*&quot; along with the &quot;1*&quot; and &quot;2*&quot; specifications for their employees.andO;Employee names would begin with a &quot;1&quot; or a &quot;2,&quot; depending on which group theywork in.andM;These wildcards can also be used for sending mail to groups.andP;  As withspecifying access levels, you need only enter the appropriate wildcard ratherthan a full user name to broadcast mail.andM;Given the obscure nature of user names when groups are employed as described,updating user lists on multiple servers can be tedious and unreliable.andP;  Witha peer-to-peer network like LANtastic, users are likely to have multipleservers and shouldn't have to run NET__MGR on each when adding a new employeeto the user lists.andP;  A method of updating this list on all or selected serversacross the network would be a welcome feature.andM;Working the SystemandM;LANtastic provides both a menu-driven interface for accessing network optionsand a command-line option.andP;  It also provides a pop-up terminate-stay-residentprogram with an abbreviated set of network functions.andP;  By calling the NETcommand without parameters, you can access the menu system.andP;  By calling thecommand with parameters, you can access a single function, such as logging into the network, attaching to particular network devices, and accessing themail and chat functions.andM;The NET command with parameters can be used in batch files so workstations orservers automatically access specific resources and bypass others.andP;  Withoutthe ability to automatically attach to network resources, users must specifyeach individual resource request after they log in to redirect printers anddrives.andP;  The NET command line is also useful for creating a generic networkstartup batch file that prompts for user name and password before connectingto the network.andP;  With a good batch file, you can even finagle the system intoattaching to network resources depending on what user is logging in.andM;Another useful NET command-line option allows users to create an indirectfile, which merely points to another file elsewhere on the network.andP;  It isthe equivalent of the Unix symbolic link.andP;  If users will access a specificfile very often, you may want to place indirect files in their homedirectories.andP;  Batch files, for example, can reside in a single directory foreasy maintenance, but each user can execute them from his home directorythrough indirect files.andP;  If the system is set up so all users access theirhome directories through H:, a single batch file can return all users totheir home directories after execution.andM;With all indirect files placed in users' home directories throughout thenetwork, a user can access the file with the same set of keystrokes no matterwhat computer he happens to use.andP;  This way, users can easily help each otherby demonstrating how to access a program or data file no matter who is loggedin.andP;  This also helps make the network transparent to users because they neverhave to think about which drive stores their most-used data.andM;LANtastic accomplishes file and record locking through DOS SHARE.andP;  When twonetwork users attempted to open Procomm Plus in my tests, the second userreceived a sharing violation error keeping multiple users from trying toaccess a single-user application.andP;  When two users--one running Word 4.0, theother running Word 5.0--attempted to access the same document, the seconduser received a file locked error.andP;  This lock ensures that users will notwrite over one anothers' data.andP;  These errors depend on how the applicationsupports NETBIOS networks and DOS SHARE.andM;Straight TalkandM;An interesting option that sets LANtastic apart from other low-cost networksis the fact that it supports voice input and output for e-mail and networkchatting.andP;  This option can be used as a substitute for voice mail within acompany, but it cannot handle voice messages from outside the network sincethere is no e-mail gateway through which outside users can leave messages.andO;The voice adapter support does make for some fun and has a few practical usesthat have yet to fully mature.andM;With the voice chat feature, you can put your phone on do-not-disturb andshut yourself away from phone calls from the outside world while stillleaving yourself available for other network users.andP;  When a user attempts toaccess you through the NET CHAT function, a message pops up on your screenuntil you press the escape key to abort the message.andP;  You can enter NET CHATto exchange messages with the user or pick up the handest that comes with thevoice adapter card to communicate verbally.andP;  This is especially useful ifchat has been initiated, but the topic has become too cumbersome to expressby typing.andM;Those who are uncertain of their typing or writing expense may be fond of thevoice option in LANtastic's e-mail.andP;  I once worked for a man who said thateveryone was afraid to send me e-mail for fear I would correct their grammar.andO;I'm sure he would love to send voice messages with the same ease as e-mailmessages.andM;With the 6KB LANVOICE driver loaded into memory, users who access the NETMAIL function have options for recording and listening to e-mail.andP;  Input andoutput can also come from standard RCA devices such as tape players andheadphones.andP;  Up to four minutes may be recorded and saved to a file of about2MB without any compression.andP;  With compression, the sound quality lessensslightly, but the file requires about half as much disk space.andP;  When a usersends either voice or textual messages, he must specify a server beforespecifying a user.andP;  The message is then stored to a file on the specifiedserver, and the user is notified of incoming mail.andM;A listener may scroll through voice messages just as he would a text messageto skip through the boring parts and find the important information.andP;  I'veoften wanted to scroll through a voice-mail message on my phone system to getto a phone number or playback a name without having to play the wholemessage.andM;When a user records voice messages, he can pause the recording to collect histhoughts or record over the first attempt if he changes his mind about whathe wants to say.andP;  He can't scroll through the message, but the ability toabort and record from the start allows him to control the content of themessage almost as easily as he controls the contents of textual e-mail.andO;Voice messages through e-mail can therefore be better thought out thantelephone system voice mail allows.andM;Voice messages can even be sent to groups.andP;  That means that bosses who findthat they don't have time to talk to employees in person can send voicee-mail to inform everyone of upcoming meetings.andP;  Hearing the voice will havea more personal feel than reading text.andP;  Yet, anything as important as ameeting schedule should be accompanied by textual e-mail since users may wantto print out a copy to post on the wall by their desks for future reference.andM;You cannot combine voice and text in a single message, though.andP;  This may be agood thing since one can distract from the other--few people can concentrateboth on what they are reading and what they are hearing at the same time.andP;  Itwould be nice, however, to be able to attach text to voice e-mail and viceversa so the recipient can easily access two related items in sequence.andP;  Forexample, if you need to send everyone a copy of a meeting schedule, it wouldbe nice to send a voice message saying simply, &quot;Here's this week's schedule,&quot;and attach the file containing the schedule.andP;  With such a message, recipientshave only one entry in their incoming mail.andM;Another nice feature would be one allowing recipients to access the voicee-mail in conjunction with an ASCII text editor.andP;  This would let users entertheir own notes as they listen to their e-mail.andP;  Editing text while listeningto e-mail would make the system infinitely more useful--you could even senddictation with it, and your assistant could transcribe directly into a wordprocessor.andP;  With the right equipment, voice messages could even be a usefultool for visually impaired people.andM;The exciting capabilities of voice on computers will come in the near future.andO;Online help and computerized tutorials are ideal applications for voiceadapters.andP;  Tutorials would especially benefit from voice.andP;  Users couldreceive a friendly human voice encouraging them to continue with thecomputerized lesson, instead of hearing frustrating beeps and reading screensfull of text.andM;As all of this development gets under way, I hope companies will get togetherand standardize voice files, or at least write translation programs from onesystem to another.andP;  When I used one of the Canon Navigator's voice files (Imentioned it has a built-in phone; it also has a software answering machine)with the LANtastic option for mailing voice files, the LANtastic relayedpainfully loud static.andP;  If developers don't standardize or translate, atleast they could write in the ability to recognize an invalid file and notattempt to play it.andP;  I hope that eventually the Navigator and other voicemessages can be mailed out to users on a LANtastic network.andP;  That way smalloffices that can't afford networks and a voice-mail telephone system can atleast partially automate with a computerized answering machine and thecapability to receive that system's messages in voice format anywhere on thenetwork.andM;Happy TalkandM;LANtastic is a good networking system, easily customized to meet the needs ofalmost any company.andP;  This operating system is also affordable for companiesthat have limited resources and easily installed and maintained for those whodon't want to hire a specially trained network administrator.andP;  The fact thatit also supports voice messaging is a bonus that may help ease the fear ofnetworks where new technology is not easily accepted.andP;  They could even makenetworks fun.andP;  Think of how much better it will be to send voice messagesinstead of text when you've got a great joke to share.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
