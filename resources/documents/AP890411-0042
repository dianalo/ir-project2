Just off Kodiak's coast is a gloppy mess that could end a way oflife in Kodiak, which last year handled fish harvests worth morethan $166 million. The black ooze that smothered much of PrinceWilliam Sound headed this way.   And the fishermen here are not happy with Exxon's response tothe spill that left them with a 10-million-gallon nightmare.   They are holding their breath as tentacles of oil reach intofertile cod and halibut fishing grounds nearby.   ``Hellfire, man, what did they do? They didn't have anyequipment to do anything with anyway. This ought to wake somebodyup,'' Peterson said as he puffed his cigarette down to the filter.   ``They have to pass some laws to have certain things and havesomebody to ride herd on them.''   Peterson, his face weather-lined and his hands dark andwork-hardened, has depended on the sea for a living for 20 years.In his 52-foot boat, the Markayla Dawn, he harvests crab, salmonand halibut.   ``Yeah, I worry about the long-term effects. We all do. I wonderwhat will happen.''   Another one worrying is Jack Hill, part-owner of two vessels nowat sea fishing for black cod. ``It's just a tragedy,'' he said. ``Alot of the oil is on the halibut grounds and on the black codgrounds.   ``Our problem is we have a big halibut season in a month. It's a24-hour opening. If we lay the gear and have to pull it six, eightor 10 hours later because of oil, it will cost.   ``And if we have one fish that's tainted ... you can't have onebad fish in your load,'' said Hill, who has been a commercialfisherman 26 years.   ``Everybody is worried what the long-term effect is. Dependingon the long-term effects, it can mean your way of life is gone as afisherman.   ``It could be bad. It really could. Then, it might not be. Itcould affect everybody here. This is a fishing village andeverything is tied to that.''   Bill Eoff said he thinks cleanup officials should attack the oilbefore its coats Kodiak's rocky coastline.   ``I feel they better do everything they can, including hiringlocal boats and people, and get them out there.''   But he said that may not be enough.   ``In the long term, who knows? It could be years, and years andyears and years of dead areas.''</TEXT></DOC>
