In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman saidall or almost all the Nicaraguan forces have returned to theirhomeland.   Nicaragua, which announced today it was suspending militaryoperations against the U.S.-backed Contra rebels during cease-firetalks, has denied Sandinista forces entered Honduras in pursuit ofthe Contras.   Defense Minister Gen. Humberto Ortega, leader of the Nicaraguandelegation in the cease-fire talks, also urged the Contras to halttheir military activities during the three days of discussions.   Bosco Matamoros, spokesman for the Contra delegation, laterannounced a suspension of the Contras' offensive militaryoperations in Nicaragua as an ``expression of our good will.''   Redman told reporters in Washington all or nearly all theNicaraguans had left Honduras and there has been a substantialSandinista deployment on the Nicaraguan side of the border.   ``I don't have any way to confirm that it's a 100 per centwithdrawal but I think the evidence is that it has been a generalwithdrawal back across the river,'' he said.   Asked whether the American ground forces sent to Honduras lastweek can be withdrawn, Redman said it was difficult to know whatthe Sandinistas will do next.   ``One can hope that they've learned a lesson this time,'' hesaid.   On Saturday, Honduras launched an air raid aimed at driving outabout 600 Sandinistas that officials said were leaving Honduras tooslowly. The government said two U.S.-made F-5 fighter jets firedrockets at the Sandinista troops.   Honduras said the air raid was eight miles inside its borders,but Nicaragua said it was five miles within its territory.   Nicaragua formally protested the air raid as an unwarranted actof aggression. It said the Honduran planes dropped bombs in theBocay area of Nicaragua, 170 miles northeast of Managua.   ``Things are getting back to normal,'' Azcona said Sunday. ``Ifthere are no more incidents, the American will leave,'' He did notsay when the U.S. troops, which began arriving Thursday, woulddepart nor did he further describe the Sandinista withdrawal.   A high-ranking Honduran military official said Sunday thatHonduras planned to position troops all along the 500-mile-longborder with Nicaragua to guard against future incursions.   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not saywhen the troops would be in place or if this would be a permanentoperation.   President Reagan ordered the U.S. troops in after he andHonduras said 2,000 Sandinistas had crossed the border.   Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss., a member of a congressionaldelegation that ended a fact-finding mission to Honduras on Sunday,said he expects the U.S. military personnel to pull out in about aweek.   ``I think it'll all be over by then,'' Montgomery, a member ofthe House Armed Services Committee, said at a news conference atPalmerola, headquarters for the American military operation inHonduras.   The U.S. national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, alsosaid the fighting was essentially over. Appearing on ABC-TV's``This Week With David Brinkley,'' Powell said the troops willreturn to the United States soon.   Peace talks between Contra rebel leaders and officials of theSandinista government began today in the southern border post ofSapoa, Nicaragua, 90 miles south of Managua near the Costa Ricanborder.   Victor Hugo Tinoco, deputy foreign minister in Nicaragua, saidthe talks will center on finding a way for the Contras to lay downtheir arms. The Contras say the talks should include politicalissues.   The new $48 million proposal for U.S. aid to the Contras wouldinclude delivery of up to $2.5 million in previously authorizedmilitary assistance.   On Sunday, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said inWashington that the package should go forward, although he said itwas ``a little low on money.''   But some in Congress say the Reagan administration, if itchooses to back a new Contra aid request, must confront doubtsabout the seriousness of the border clash.   ``There is ... a very serious lack of full trust here,'' saidHouse Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash.   Foley said he hoped the latest round of fighting has notdestroyed chances for progress in the Nicaraguan peace talks.</TEXT></DOC>
