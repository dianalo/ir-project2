Theresult shows that the deeper the wound, the higher the /sup 144/Ce indifferent viscera. During the period of examination (up to 128 days)the deposition of /sup 144/Ce in viscera can be fitted to certain parabolicregression equations. For treating contaminated wound, the local injectionof chelating agents such as DTPA is an excellent treatment with the exceptionof surgical excision.</TEXT></DOC>
