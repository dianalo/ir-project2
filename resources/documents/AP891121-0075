Hakim, who helped broker the sale of U.S. arms to his nativeIran as part of then-President Reagan's efforts to free Americanhostages in the Middle East, is scheduled to enter the plea infederal court, said the sources, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   But the sources stressed that the deal was not final until Hakimactually appeared in court and entered the plea before U.S.District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell. A previous court appearance wasabruptly canceled recently when Hakim backed out, the sources said.   The exact terms of the plea agreement could not be obtained butsources said Hakim had agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor.   Mary Belcher, a spokeswoman for independent counsel Lawrence E.Walsh, declined to comment.   Lawyers for Reagan, meanwhile, filed court papers todayindicating they were studying the possibility of resisting asubpoena for the former president to produce documents and testifyat the Iran-Contra trial of former national security adviser JohnM. Poindexter.   The subpoena ``raises novel and complex constitutional issues,''the former president's lawyers said in seeking a two-week delay inproducing notes and papers sought by the subpoena.   ``These issues relate to the scope of the executive privilege,the power of the court to compel a former president to testify inopen court, and the threshold requirements necessary to support asubpoena... against a former president,'' said Reagan's attorney,Theodore Olson.   In the Hakim case, it was expected that Walsh would drop majorcharges of conspiracy, theft and wire fraud stemming from the armsdealer's involvement in the diversion of weapons-sale profits tothe Nicaraguan Contras.   Those charges were dropped against Hakim's other co-defendantsafter the government refused to release classified informationnecessary for trying those counts in open court.   Hakim also was charged with conspiracy and offering an illegalgratuity to former White House aide Oliver L. North. The chargesstem from a $200,000 Swiss bank account that Hakim and his formerbusiness partner, Richard V. Secord, allegedly set up for North'sfamily.   North, a former National Security Council aide and retiredMarine officer, was ordered to perform 1,200 hours of communityservice for his Iran-Contra convictions.   Secord, a retired Air Force major general, pleaded guilty Nov. 9to one count of lying to Congress during the televised hearingsabout the Iran-Contra affair.   The Justice Department also has asked for more time to complywith subpoenas for Reagan documents in the National Archives andRecords Administration.   The government's pleadings indicated misgivings about thesubpoenas seeking Reagan's papers and testimony at Poindexter'sIran-Contra trial. Poindexter is accused of lying to Congress toobstruct its inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair.   The Justice Department asked the court to delay until Dec. 6 thedeadline to comply with subpoenas for records at the archives. Thesubpoenas are returnable on Wednesday.   The department said it also sought a delay in the subpoenapersonally served on the former president, noting that Reagan'sattorney would be filing a similar request.   Justice Department spokesman Daniel Eramian said the archivesneeded more time to review more than 100,000 pages of documents.   The Justice Department also noted that ``depending upon theirnature, the United States may wish to assert that certain requesteddocuments must be protected from disclosure because of theirprivileged nature.''   ``However, even if some material is so privileged the UnitedStates may choose to make a discretionary release in any event ifgiven time to consider the overall ramifications,'' the departmentsaid.   The department noted that following the review of the documents,``both the United States and President Reagan must consider what ifany position each is required to take considering the fact andscope of the live trial testimony sought of the former president.''</TEXT></DOC>
