The court's four liberal justices, who have combinedexperience of 91 years on the high court, wrote only ahandful of important majority opinions. And many of thoseeither preserved current law or were on subjects, such asbusiness and regulatory issues, in which the court's deepideological division didn't play a role.</LP><TEXT>   In this regard, though the composition of the courtremained unchanged, the latest term differed from theprevious one. The court clearly became more conservative inthe 1988-89 term, but the liberals were in the fight. Theywere able to eke out an occasional victory and write somesignificant opinions.   This term, says Walter Dellinger, a professor at DukeUniversity Law School, with the possible exception of theaffirmative-action ruling, &quot;There is not a single significantcase decided or written by the liberal justices in whichmajor new ground was broken.   &quot;In nearly every case that divides the courtideologically, there are now five justices for a conservativeresult,&quot; Mr. Dellinger adds. In case after case, the onlysuspense was whether the sometimes disparate views of thefive conservatives would coalesce around a single rationale.   For the liberals, who are among the court's most seniormembers, this unusually passive role is a distinct change anda frustrating one, according to court insiders. The liberalwing consists of Justices William Brennan, 84 years old,Thurgood Marshall, 81, Harry Blackmun, 81, and John Stevens,70.   Even some liberal victories this term were written byothers. It isn't uncommon, especially in closely divided 5-4decisions, to assign the majority opinion to the justice whois the least committed to the position, figuring that willproduce a narrow product acceptable to all five justices.   That apparently was the strategy followed by JusticeBrennan in the important 5-4 ruling upholding the authorityof federal judges to require school districts to raise taxesto pay for school desegregation. With Chief Justice WilliamRehnquist in dissent, it fell to Justice Brennan as thesenior justice in the majority to decide who would write theopinion. The assignment went to the usually conservativeJustice Byron White, who probably wrote a narrower opinionthan any of the liberals would have.   The decision was one of the most important liberalvictories of the term. But it was a reaffirmation of federalcourt power to correct civil rights violations, not a new orexpanded principle. Moreover, it wasn't written by theliberals.   To be sure, there were other liberal victories, but nonethat recognized new constitutional rights and only a few thatexpanded rights. Justice Brennan's opinion yesterday,upholding two Federal Communications Commission preferenceprograms to aid minorities and women in obtaining broadcastlicenses, was a broad endorsement of federal affirmativeaction. But the ruling, while unexpected, is an extension ofa 1980 Supreme Court decision.   Similarly, Justice Marshall's opinion striking down NorthCarolina's death penalty law was foreshadowed by an earlierruling. And Justice Brennan's decision striking down thefederal flag desecration law was based almost entirely on theruling a year ago invalidating the Texas flag law.   The abortion issue provides a long-term illustration ofthe pattern. Through most of the 1980s, a bare liberalmajority held back state efforts to restrict the right toabortion. Now, for the second consecutive year, the liberalwing had to content itself with rulings that upheld new staterestrictions, though the most severe aspects were struckdown.   ---             Voting Blocs in the Supreme Court                                                                                                          This chart shows the different voting blocs of fivejustices and how often they voted together in the SupremeCourt's 5-4 decisions.
