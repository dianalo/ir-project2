 Immediate benefits car include increased productivity, agenerally higher-quality product, a decrease in physical storage space neededand more secure data.andM;Already, imaging is a well-established technology in sophisticated graphicsapplications.andP;  For instance, it is widely used to clarify, modify and managesatellite photographs, medical photographs and images connected withincreasingly automated manufacturing processes.andM;But document image processing in office applications is where the typicalbusiness can find the greatest payback.andP;  This technology can help companiesand governments manage the massive paper flow that computers generate.andM;In a document image processing system, paperbased sources ofinformation--letters, reports and other documents--are fed into scanners thatdigitize the information and store it on high-capacity Winchester or opticaldisk drives.andP;  The stored documents are transferred electronically to theappropriate departments where they are processed on-line.andM;For output, the documents can be reproduced on laser printers.andM;Basic costs for document image processing systems include hardware, software,implementation, conversion of existing documents to image files and, ofcourse, on-going maintenance charges.andM;A document imaging system can range from a $22,000 setup with a single PC, alaser printer, a scanner and a 3-1/2-inch optical drive to amultimillion-dollar network involving many workstations, large disklibraries, several high-end scanners, a dedicated server and costly systemintegration.andM;System and application software costs vary widely accordingly to applicationand image sysem size, and whether off-the-shelf applications or thosedeveloped in-house are implemented.andM;However, across all types of applications, the average 40-person site willlikely incur a per-seat cost of about $40,000 for hardware.andP;  Such a site canalso spend several hundred thousand dollars on software, consulting andproject management.andM;Although the expenses may be high, so are the potential rewards: A carefullyimplemented imaging system can increase productivity substantial and reducecosts over a wide range of business activities.andM;A survey conducted earlier this year by International Data Corp./AvantTechnology of Framingham, Mass., indicated that 107 business sitesrepresenting a wide variety of applications improved productivity an averageof 25 percent when they added document image processing systems.andM;And according to a recent study by Bis Cap International, a market researchcompany in Norwell, Mass., companies that use imaging technology in general,encompassing both graphics and document image processing, average a 50percent increase in office transaction volume.andP;  On average, they also log a30 percent decrease in staff, a 50 percent reduction in space and a 50percent reduction in transaction processing time.andP;  (See &quot;Typical DocumentImage Processing Benefits,&quot; page 49.)andM;Return on investment is highest at work-flow-intensive sites where documentsare passed around or frequently modified, at sites with a highdocument-retrieval rate and at sites with a high penalty for losingdocuments.andM;In general, the larger the site, the better the potential for cost savings.andO;Frequency of use, however, is also a crucial factors in opting for documentimage processing technology.andP;  For example, at large sites where the number ofrecords is enormous, but the retrieval rate is low, the costs of implementingan imaging system may not be justified.andM;On the other hand, an organization requiring frequent, rapid access to manydocuments can reap steady benefits.andP;  For example, an insurance company couldreduce turnaround time on policy inquiries, thus cutting back on the size ofthe staff that is required to handle them.andM;According to a report by Bis Cap International, some companies were able toreduce staff by 80 percent by implementing a document imaging system.andM;To be sure, a system that can realize such productivity gains on ahigh-volume load is not cheap.andP;  But implementing an imaging system could helpa company slash data-retrieval time.andM;For example, at one insurance company's policy inquiry desk, the timerequired to retrieve paper-based information ranged as high as 90 minutes perinjuiry.andP;  A document image processing system cut that to a maximum of 10minutes, according to the report.andM;Such gains provide quantitative cost-justification, but an imaging systemalso pays for itself in valuable good will among customers seeking fastservice.andM;SPACE IS MONEYandM;Another major cost savings, especially for a business in a high-rent districtsuch as New York, is space.andM;According to research by Image Consulting Group, a New York consultingcompany, 1 million pages of documents require about 570 square feet of filecabinets.andP;  At a rental fee of $60 per square foot annually, the cost of thatspace would total about $34,200.andM;By using a document image system, the same amount of information can bestored on optical disks in about 5.5 square feet at a space cost of $330.andP;  Inthis example, the cost savings is $33,870, or a whopping 99 percent!andM;Further cost benefits entail telephone and postal savings.andP;  A service-basedcompany with an imaging system will find that not only does it mean fewerreturn calls to customers because information is more readily accessible, butoften the information can be conveyed to the customer during his call,perhaps on his dime.andM;For on-line applications within a business, a company can realize savings onpostal and overnight mail services.andM;In these cases, time savings naturally result.andP;  Improvement in the quality ofwork is also very possible because of the ease with which employees canexchange documents or pictures across a network.andM;However, the major drawback of a document imaging system is the incredibleamount of band-width a digitized document can absorb when it is transmittedon a network.andP;  A single image file can be 300MB.andM;To avoid this bandwidth problem, a company could compress or decompressimages using algorithms including the CCITT's Group 3 and Group 4 facsimilestandards.andM;Although this may ease the network's burden, it also adds to the processingoverhead necessary to transmit image-based documents.andM;One trick when creating a cost-effective imaging system is to alter thecompany's work flow to process portions of the documents in parallel.andO;Because an imaging system enables a company to process documents in parallelrather than linearly, a canny MIS manager can work with users to streamlinethe flow of documents through an organization.andM;A good document image processing implementation often results in asubstantial change in the eddies and currents of an organization's paperwork.andO;Installing a system gives management an opportunity to think about the mostproductive and cost-effective ways for work flow to move through theorganization.andP;  Planning out the system fully before it is implemented is keyto cost savings.andM;If a business does not map out the optimal route for work based on theadvantages of the imaging system, potential productivity improvements will belost.andP;  For example, an imaged mortgage application in a property implementedsystem could be worked on simultaneously by all the different groups whoseinput is required for approval.andM;However, if the old, linear style of managing mortgage applications isretained in a bank's document image processing implementation, requiringpapers to be shuffled from one department to another as each set is finishedand approved, the bank stands very little chance of reaping the full benefitsof its imaging system.andM;Another reason to plan carefully for a particular application before it isimplemented is the nature of the document imaging system itself.andP;  Imagingsoftware, regardless of the application, tends to be tuned in one of twogeneral ways.andP;  Some programs are faster for shipping and making changes todocuments.andP;  Other software is better suited to systems with large volumes ofinformation, such as databases, that are often accessed but seldom changed.andM;The key to work-flow-intensive programs, often used for applications likeinsurance underwriting, is a scripting language that gives programmers ashortcut to applications development.andP;  For example, a programmer who wants adocument indexed and shipped to three specific terminals can use thescripting language instead of coding individual calls to index and ship toeach one.andM;IMAGES OF SAVINGSandM;Users need to keep in mind when implementing an imaging system, be itwork-flow-intensive or not, that the largest productivity savings will not berealized for several years, when all aspects of a business are aligned viaimaging.andM;As with any large project, the best course is to start small, with a pilotimaging program covering one visible, high-return function of abusiness--billing, for example.andP;  If the system works well in the pilotprogram, it can be expanded to include other aspects of the company'sbusiness.andM;Because imaging often involves high overhead for image processing anddocument exchange between work sites, system managers must plan the networkimplementation carefully, bearing in mind that a pilot imaging system will belikely to slow down other applications on the network.andM;In implementing a document imaging system, an organization must determine themost cost-effective approach of transferring existing documents into thesystem.andP;  Depending on a particular company's requirements, one of threegeneral approaches can be chosen.andM;The most costly is to transfer all documents to the imaging systemimmediatley.andP;  The second, more moderate approach is to transfer documents asthey are used, leaving behind information that is no longer needed.andM;The third option is to begin anew on the imaging system, thus eliminating thecosts of paper-to-computer transfer while continuing to support the oldmanual system, perhaps for years, until all information has been updated oris no longer needed.andM;The cost of transferring documents depends on the number of documents and theprocessing speed required.andM;The cheapest means of transfer are scanners that connects to PCs and processbetween 2 and 4 pages per minute (ppm).andP;  Ranging in cost from $1,500 to$3,000, they are used primarily to transfer documents into image filecabinets for very small systems.andM;Midrange scanners, which connect to PCs or workstations, scan between 15 ppmand 20 ppm, and range in cost from $12,000 to $16,000, including controlledand software.andM;High-end scanners that input from 30 ppm to 60 ppm require a dedicated serverand are priced from $50,000 to $100,000.andM;At the very high end, high-resolution scanners used mainly by banks arepriced from $250,000 to several million dollars, and can scan several hundredpages a minute.andM;DASHING DOTSandM;Scanners generally operate at between 200 dots per inch (dpi) and 600 dpi,though 300 dpi provides good enough quality for most pictures.andP;  However, mostscanners slow down substantially when scanning graphics rather than text.andM;As a rule, as the number of dots per inch increases, pricing is notnecessarily concomitant.andP;  However, there is the penalty of slower input speedas the dot-per-inch number increases.andM;The cost of the transfer is not limited to the scanner because documents aremost often input in a two-step process.andP;  The first step scans the documentimage into digital form for storage on the computer.andP;  The second step assignsthe document to an index field by which the document can be tracked on thesystem.andM;Because a document is worthless unless it can be accessed, the cost ofindexing must be included in the cost of transfer.andP;  Indexing usually requiresmanual labor.andM;Optical character recognition (OCR) technology can be used to automate sometypes of indexing, but in the case of a full-text imaging system, where everyword is used as a document index and must be exactly correct, human input isrequired.andM;After the OCR device converts a scanned image into an ASCII file, a personchecks each word and makes corrections.andP;  Although OCR can be performed viahardware or software, the cost of either method is several thousand dollars.andM;As a result, the total input cost per page ranges from 25 cents per page fora basic system to $1 per page when several fields of information requireindexing, to $4 per page for full-text indexing.andP;  (See &quot;Typical DocumentConversion Indexing Costs,&quot; page 52.)andM;Many businesses decide to use outside services to convert existing files viadocument imaging, or to perform data entry on a regular basis.andM;At sites requiring the most sophisticated imaging systems--for example, wheremany high-quality documents are to be converted, or where custom equipment isinvolved--several years may elapse before the savings from the system catchup with its cost.andM;A large bank can spend millions of dollars on an imaging system.andP;  A typicalcheck sorter/reader alone will cost $2 million.andM;Add to this a mainframe server at $1 million, 200 workstations at $10,000each to access the imaged data for $2 million more, a scanner, several laserprinters, system and job-allocation software, and maintenance.andP;  The totalprice can easily reach $10 million.andM;But if the company realizes the average 25 percent gain in productivity peryear, this initial expense can be paid for within three to five years.andM;THE WELL-TUNED CPUandM;A potential pitfall in document image processing implementation is an imagingscheme that uses an existing CPU for imaging server overhead.andM;Mainframes are tuned for different applications, with bandwidth and I/Ospecifications set up for specific levels of traffic.andP;  Since document imageprocessing is very movement-intensive, it can quickly eat up CPU power on aserver not specifically tuned for imaging.andM;Unless a site has a great deal of spare CPU power, preferably on a CPU thatcan be tuned for imaging-type applications, the best bet is to buy a serverdedicated to the imaging application.andM;In the final analysis, an imaging system can give a wide range of businessesan edge over competitors in both speed and presentation.andP;  But implementing animaging system is expensive and must be carefully undertaken for a company torealize full cost savings.andM;Implemented correctly, an image processing system gives users faster accessto information and raises their productivity.andP;  In such a scenario, highercompany revenues naturally follow.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
