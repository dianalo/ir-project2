President Reagan should make it official by issuing some pardons and sending Mr. Walsh packing.    Despite two years of pounding headlines about the Iran-Contra &quot;scandal,&quot; this issue fell off the radar screens in the election campaign. Michael Dukakis tried to generate some interest by agitating for harsh criminal penalties even before any trial had begun, but in the end the administration that Lt. Col. North worked for won the election. Among the big reasons the voters decided to keep Mr. Dukakis in Massachusetts was his weak positions on foreign policy. In this respect, the voters and Ollie North agree: The world is a dangerous place.    Congress huffed and puffed, but didn't pass a single piece of legislation it had threatened in the wake of Iran-Contra. A plan to make the national security adviser subject to Senate approval went nowhere. A proposal that Presidents must tell Congress about all covert operations within 48 hours died after Speaker Jim Wright did some leaking of his own, posing a threat to jailed dissidents in Nicaragua.    Meanwhile, Mr. Walsh and his phalanx of lawyers, FBI agents, IRS inspectors and others by the end of September had spent some $10.8 million of taxpayer money to bring a criminal case a county prosecutor would be too embarrassed even to consider. As Gordon Crovitz shows nearby, the core of Mr. Walsh's case so misstates the executive-branch view of the law that the Justice Department on Friday will file a brief against him. How strange this filing will be. Mr. Walsh is the U.S. in U.S. v. North, yet to make his case he felt he had to take positions that the U.S. government never takes. Among these is the incredible claim that people can go to jail for violating a law that Congress might have passed, but didn't.    Mr. Walsh may be playing to the Congressmen who created independent counsel to sic on executive-branch officials, but there is no reason for the executive to put up with this nonsense. In its request to Judge Gerhard Gesell seeking permission to file against Mr. Walsh, the Justice Department said such a brief would be the &quot;most practical way for the court to ascertain the legal positions that have been adopted by the executive branch.&quot; This is not the only step President Reagan can take.    In upholding independent counsel in Morrison v. Olson, the Supreme Court emphasized that &quot;the attorney general may remove an independent counsel for 'misconduct.'&quot; It's hard to imagine any greater abuse by a prosecutor than taking positions so at odds with the Constitution, common law and established Justice policies merely to crucify his targets. President Reagan should exercise his legitimate authority and fire Mr. Walsh rather than permit the prosecutor to wander even further from his original charge. Mr. Walsh's latest arguments show that there is no legal case against the Iran-Contra defendants.    There is yet another reason for presidential pardons. It is that separation of powers has become one of the chief political issues of the day. Congress has been usurping traditional executive-branch functions, from independent counsel to veto-proof omnibus appropriations to the War Powers Resolution to who interprets treaties. This institutional battle is now also partisan, with Democrats eager to pummel an office they see no hope of capturing while at the same time expanding the powers of the branch they control.    Democrats in Congress have already thrown down the gauntlet to George Bush. He has no mandate, they say, and he'll have to take his marching orders from them. President Reagan can put his successor on firmer ground with pardons that will tell Congress that the executive branch won't sanction any more criminalizing of policy differences.    President Reagan has an obligation to future Presidents to leave the office with its constitutional powers and position intact. Sometimes this means running the risk of political heat, though in the case of Iran-Contra pardons this risk is small. The dangers of failing to do the right thing may be greater. On this, President Reagan might want to consult the biblical scholar, Hillel:   &quot;If I am not for myself, who will be? And if I am for myself only, what am I? And if not now, when?&quot;    (See related story: &quot;The U.S. vs. U.S. v. North&quot; -- WSJ November 16, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
