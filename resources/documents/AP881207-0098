Gorbachev would continue their ``quest forhuman rights and personal freedom'' when they hold lunchtime talksthis afternoon on Governors Island.   The 2{-hour meeting is concluding a relationship between the twosuperpower leaders that has mellowed since their first summit threeyears ago.   President-elect George Bush is joining the pair at the luncheontable.   ``Although our time together will be brief, I welcome thisopportunity for a final meeting between myself, President Gorbachevand Vice President Bush that will demonstrate the continuity of theprocess that we first put in place in Geneva in 1985,'' Reagan toldreporters as he prepared to leave for Governors Island and his fifthand final summit with the Kremlin leader.   He said, ``The quest for human rights and personal freedom isvery much a part of the agenda of the American-Soviet relations.''   Today's meeting was one that Reagan did not anticipate when hevisited Moscow last summer and withdrew ``evil empire'' from hispolitical vocabulary.   For Reagan, in the twilight of his presidency, the trip to NewYork could be the sentimental culmination to a relationship thatovercame his distrust of most things Soviet.   The relationship reached a high point last summer on the streetsof Moscow, where Gorbachev introduced his American guest to startledRussians. At one point, he gathered a small boy into his arms andsaid, ``Shake hands with grandfather Reagan.''   Reagan, reminded that he had described the Soviet Union as an``evil empire'' that was not to be trusted, dismissed that as acomment ``about another time, another era.''   Today's meeting also gave Reagan's wife Nancy a chance to patchthings up with Raisa Gorbachev _ a rival with whom, Mrs. Reagan hasacknowledged, she was not in sync. The two ladies were to have afinal lunch together as their husbands met.   Before flying to New York on Tuesday, Mrs. Reagan contended thatthe Nancy-Raisa feud was a reporters' invention, or at least anexaggeration.   ``You all keep saying that there's ... fussing and feuding, butthere really isn't,'' she said. ``I think there's been too muchattention paid to it.''   Reagan planned to return to Washington this evening and addressthe American Enterprise Institute, probably using that forum to sumup his talk with Gorbachev.   Reagan also scheduled a news conference for prime time Thursdayevening _ probably his last such meeting with the White House presscorps.   Mrs. Reagan, talking with reporters as she accepted delivery ofthe White House Christmas tree, admonished them, ``Be nice. It's hislast one.''   Reagan leaves office Jan. 20, relinquishing the White House toBush, who was traveling separately to New York for the meeting withGorbachev.   Reagan and Gorbachev first met in Geneva in 1985 and made someprogress toward agreement on arms control.   They conferred again at Reykjavik, Iceland, in October 1986, at ameeting that was initially billed as ``not a summit'' but turnedinto an extended bargaining session over a Gorbachev proposal for adramatic slash of 30 to 50 percent in each of the superpowers'arsenals of strategic arms. Last-minute disagreement over Reagan'sStar Wars program blocked any agreement and left American officialsdejected.   An arms control agreement was reached at the nextReagan-Gorbachev meeting, in Washington in December, 1987. Itprovided for the actual destruction of nuclear weapons with eachnation observing that unprecedented act.   Further arms control agreements eluded the two leaders in Moscowlast June, but they cemented their personal relationship and Reaganused the Kremlin as a pulpit for preaching the virtues of democracyand freedom.</TEXT></DOC>
