Proposes $1.15 Million In Fines For Explosion That KilledThree</HEAD><BYLINE>By JOHN SOLOMON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The U.S. Labor Department today cited twocontractors for safety and health violations and proposed $1.15million in fines for a methane gas explosion that killed threeworkers in a sewer tunnel project.   S.A. Healy of McCook, Ill., the main contractor for the project,was cited for 68 willful violations carrying fines of $680,000 inconnection with last November's fatal blast. CH2M Hill, ofCorvallis, Ore., hired to supervise the project, was cited for 47willful violations carrying penalties of $470,000.   Both companies have 15 days to appeal the citations andpenalties to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,said Mike Connors, regional administrator of OSHA's Chicago office.   The proposed fine of $10,000 per willful violation was themaximum allowed, Connors said.   Willful violations are the most serious issued by OSHA and arebased on a finding that the contractors knew that a dangerouscondition violated safety standards and made no effort to correctit, Connors said.   ``These penalties are one of the largest I am aware of for theregion and certainly the largest that I am aware of for a tunnelproject,'' he said.   OSHA investigators believe they have located the exact cause ofthe Nov. 10 explosion but Connors declined to release thatinformation, citing concerns about future litigation.   Criminal negligence charges could also be filed against thecontractors, he said.   The citations accused the two contractors of failing to trainworkers about the proper response when methane is detected in atunnel, using inappropriate electrical equipment and wiring methodsfor a ``gassy'' tunnel, failing to have adequate ventilation forthe tunnel, and keeping inadeqauate records of air monitoring inthe tunnel.   OSHA's investigation concluded that the two contractors weredirectly responsible for the deaths of the three workers, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
