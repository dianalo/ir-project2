The advent of the Professional Extension pushedit to a level of features and composition quality that could compete withmany of the prominent pubfishing systems being sold into the professionalmarket.andP;  However, a key distinction remained: Ventura Publisher's roots arein the single-user MS-DOS world, while professional-level systems are almostall multiuser products.andM;With the arrival of the Network Server, Ventura has now become the first ofthe desktop publishing vendors to offer a .multiuser publishing product.andO;This is a significant step, since most serious publishing enterprises arebased on groups of writers, editors, artists and so forth.andP;  Ventura is nowclearly playing in the big leagues, But being in the same league is not thesame as winning.andP;  As we shall see, Ventura has not quite solved thefile-collision problems that a multiuser environment poses.andM;In this article, we will not rehash our earlier reviews of Ventura Publisher(Vol.1, No.andP;  7) and the Professional Extension (Vol.andP;  ,2 No.andP;  12).andP;  TheNetwork Server changes very little of Ventura's functionality and performancein the areas of editing, composition, pagination and graphics, rather, wewill focus on the new issues that are raised in a networked environment:memory requirements, remote printer support, user licensing and filemanagement.andM;Network supportandM;Ventura currendy provides direct support for three of the most popular PCnetwork operating systems: Novell, 3Com, and PC Net.andP;  Tops is not supported.andO;Although the outward appearance of the program is largely unchanged, severalaspects of its operation are modified for the network environment.andP;  The mostobvious change, of course, is that no matter how many users you have, thereis only a single copy of each program, font, printer and screen driver file,and all users load these common files when they begin a Ventura session.andO;Thus, a workstation need not have its own hard disk.andM;We tested die Network Server extensively on our Novel network andexperimented with it on our 3Com net.andP;  We do not have PC Net installed.andM;Configurations.andP;  It is likely that there will be several differentcombinations of displays and mouse types on the various PCs across thenetwork.andP;  To accommodate all the variations in hardware, Ventura stores eachuser's setup information in that user's personal network directory.andP;  So eachuser must have a separate, unique personal directory.andM;There are several configuration files; Ventura uses them toandM;' record each user's preference settings, printer selection and width tables,and so on.andP;  One way to create them is to run the installation program(VPPREP) separately for each user (You would also then run the installationeach time the user modified his hardware setup.) Alternatively, you cansimply copy the batch file that stars Ventura running from the home directoryof the first user you install into each additional user's personal directory,then modify it with a text editor to reflect hardware configuration.andP;  Venturawill create the configuration files the first time that user runs it.andP;  ThisinstaUation should be done by a network administrator, or at least someonewho is very famliar with MS-DOS and the particulars of the networkinstallation.andP;  We are advised that when you update a user's configuration byediting the batch file, you should erase the configuration files (those withan .INF suffix) because if they contain information that contradicts the newsetup, Ventura may crash.andM;Paths.andP;  Ventura puts specific disk-drive letters (e.g., F:) into the path andMe names in the chapter files.andP;  (As you may recall, the chapter file containsno text, just the names of other files from which the text can be loaded.)andO;While this is no problem on a single-server Novell net, it is verysignificant on a 3Com network or on a multiple-server Novell net.andP;  For thisreason, Ventura instructs the installer that all users must assign the samedrive letter to each network partition.andP;  This is probably a good idea  in anycase, because it makes user training and network administration easier.andP;  Butpersuading experienced users of an estabfished network to change their habitsso Ventura can be installed may take some doing.andM;Memory management.andP;  Most PC networks gobble up considerable amounts ofworkstation memory for device drivers, protocol and session managers,redirectors and so on.andP;  Novell, which consumes about 60K, is better in thisrespect than 3Com, which takes about IIOK But even Novell's memoryconsumption is too much for the standalone base -level Ventura Publisher,which must have 560K of available memory.andP;  Considering that DOS takes 60-80K(depending on which version you run-DOS 3.3 takes more than 3.1) out of theavailable 640K, the difficulty is obvious.andP;  The Network Server versioncompensates by supporting EMS memory on both the base-level program and dieProfessional Extension.andP;  It also maintains a temporary memoryoverflow file inthe user's personal directory.andM;Ventura's instaUation guide lists a number of ways you can free up memory forVentura.andP;  First and foremost, of course, is to add EMS memory.andP;  Some networkcards, such as 3Com's Etherlink Plus, have on-board memory where much of thenetworking software can reside, reducing the toll on main memory.andP;  PCs with'386 processors can run a memory-management program like Qualitas's 386MAX,while '286-based machines can use Microsoft's HIMEM.SYS.andP;  Finally, you caninstruct Ventura to use less memory for its internal buffers; performancewill deteriorate because more data will have to be kept on disk, but reducedperformance is better than none.andM;Ultimately, the only cure to memory management problems will be to switchover to OS/2 and buy lots of memory for each PC.andP;  Ventura previewed an OS/2version of Ventura Publisher at Comdex/Spring and expects to ship it thisfall.andM;Printer support.andP;  AU three networks that Vcntura supports provide ways toredirect printing to a network spooler.andP;  (SPOOL was originally an acronym forSimultaneous Peripheral Output On Line.) Your workstation may think it issending data to its LPT port, but the network software actually reroutes itto the file server and thence to a network printer Ventura's Network Serversoftware helps this process along by providing explicit, network-specificend-of-job commands so the spooler program can know when to dose the spoolfile and print the job.andM;(In a standalone environment, where the printer is directly connected to thecomputer, there is no problem.andP;  Ike printer prints each page as it gets it;when the printer cannot accept further data, it sends a pause command back tothe computer, and when there is no morc data to print, the printer stops.andP;  Ina network enviromnent, though, several users may simultaneously try to accessthe same printer It would be awkward if thc pages of different users gotintermixed.andP;  The network opcrating system copes by stacking up the printrequests in disk files, actually printing the jobs only when they seem to becomplete.andP;  A simple time-out mechanism that closes thc print file after aperiod of inactivity is usually provided.andP;  However, a time-out can fail byclosing the file prematurely; this is particularly likely to happen withcomplex pages.)andM;One problem that crops up when printing through a spooler is that the spoolermay run out of disk space for its temporary files.andP;  Depending on whichnetwork you have, this may result in mysterious file server crashes, but itis sure to result in the loss of some pages.andP;  The problem is particularlyacute when printing graphics on a PostScript printer; thc spool files cangrow quite large.andP;  (One of our PostScript test files, which has only onehigh-resolution scanned image, is more than 5 MB long.) Ventura has severalfeatures to minimize the problem.andM;When printing a multiple- chapter document, Ventura sends an end-of-jobcommand after each chapter This allows the printer to remove files from thespool queue more often, reducing the risk of spooler overflow and minimizingthe damage if overflow does occur.andP;  It also adds some risk that you will haveto remove other users' jobs that get interleaved between your chapters, butthe interleaving can only occur at chapter boundaries and the alternativewould be to stop all other users from printing.andM;Network Server allows you to pre-download the PCL or PostScript fonts you aregoing to use.andP;  The standalone versions of Ventura download a font at eachpoint in the file where it is requested; if there are very many calls to sucha font, the file size could mushroom and clog up a spooler in no time flat.andM;A user-settable option, provided in the POSTSCPT.CNF file, tells Ventura toreduce the size of image files at the expense of somewhat longer printingtime.andP;  Named printers.andP;  Ventura also gives additional support to Novell andPC Net printing by allowing the user to assign symbolic names to networkprinters and to refer to those names in thc print setup dialog.andP;  (3Comhandles this at the operating system level with its &quot;sharename&quot; approach andthe 3P LINK command.) For example, one might have several LaserWritersscattered around the building, each with a different name; the user coulddecide which one to send a job to at the moment die job is to be printed,Most important,' users can each set up their own printer-naming files (whichcan be edited by any word processor) so the names will be meaningful to them.andO;We think this is a nice touch.andM;Alas, the programming technique used to implement symbolic names conflictswith the way Novell handles LocalTalk printers; it only works if the printeris directly tied to a server parallel or serial port.andP;  We suspect that thisis something NoveU will have to fix in a future release.andM;Corollary choices.andP;  There are a number of aspects of a professional-calibermultiuser publishing system that Ventura does not address.andP;  We bring this up,not in criticism of Venturi, but to alert readers that decisions they make inother areas will affect how Vcntura performs.andP;  One such area is logonsecurity.andP;  In many sensitive information.andP;  It can also be important thatsystem information (hyphenation dictionaries, style sheets and the like) bechanged only by people who know what they are doing.andP;  A PC applicationprogram like Ventura could offer its own logon security checking, but webelieve that this responsibility is best addressed by the network operatingsystem.andM;Novell offers the best security scheme that we have seen on a local areanetwork.andP;  It is comprehensive and flexible, allowing separate privilegelevels for each directory and subdirectory, although not for each file.andO;Passwords may be required at any level.andP;  Privileges to read, write, createand delete file, view directories and so forth are assigned to individualsand to groups; a user's rights to any directory are a combination of hisindividual rights and those of any groups he belongs to.andM;The 3Com operating system lets you put passwords on sharenames (symbolicnames that map server directories as virtual disk drives) but once you havegained access to a sharename, you have full access to all its subdirectories.andO;PC Net is even weaker; it essentially offers the same services as MS-DOS.andM;User licensingandM;Ventura Publisher has never been copy-protected in the sense of preventingthe user from reproducing the disks.andP;  Business users in today's market simplywon't buy software that they can't back up or that is inconvenient to use.andO;But with the advent of a product specifically aimed at networked users,Ventura and Xerox decided that they could not allow users to reap unlimitedbenefits.andP;  The Network Server limits the number of simultaneous Venturasessions by a process of registering serial numbers.andM;The Network Server, by itsel, f lets any single user on the net run one copyof the Vcntura Publisher base-level program.andP;  However, it will preventadditional simultaneous users unless you register additional copies ofVentura Publisher In our opinion, this is eminently reasonable and imposesonly a small inconvenience (see Lost tokens, below) on the ordinary user.andO;The extra work for the installer or network administrator is also minimal.andM;Installation.andP;  Disk #2 in each Ventura Publisher or Professional Extensionpackage bears a unique serial number As part of the installation process, youmust insert each of your #2 disks so thc installer program can read theserial number and verify that it is unique.andP;  (We believe that the serialnumbers are encoded with check-digits, so that a random alteration of thedigits would probably not succeed.) The installation routine then writes intothe Ventura directory an encrypted file named VP.SER that records how manybase-level Venturas and how many Professional Extensions have beenregistered.andM;Note that there is nothing to prevent you from working with backup floppies.andO;They have the same serial numbers as their originals, so they can easily beused, but they will not increase the number of registrations.andM;As each user fires up a Ventura session, the program &quot;checks out&quot; a tokenfrom VP.SER.andP;  When a user quits Ventura, the token is returned.andP;  An attemptto run more sessions than there are tokens results in a message advising theuser to wait till someone else quits.andP;  The program does not care who uses itor what computer it runs on, just how many simultaneous sessions are running.andO;There are separate limits for the base program and for the ProfessionalExtension.andM;True extension.andP;  The Network Server registers four classes of tokens: baseprogram, Professional Extension, disabled base program and disabledProfessional Extension.andP;  Registering a basc program increments thebase-program counter.andP;  Registering a Professional Extension increments the PEcounter, but it also disables one base program-it decrements the base-programcounter and increments the disabled-base-program counter.andP;  If you installmore PEs than you have base programs, the extras are held in the disabled-PEcounter untU you register more base programs.andM;Thus, the Network Server treats the Professional Extension as a trueextension product, requiring you to have at least one base for eachextension.andM;Lost tokens.andP;  One of the dangers of checking out tokens is that the user'sworkstation may crash during the session.andP;  (In our experience, this isparticularly likely 'when making changes to the hardware.andP;  We had onecomputer lock up when we instaUed the wrong mouse driver; another keptglitching after we added memory until we got the settings for 386&quot; workedout.) Since he never executes the code to quit from Ventura, his token is notreturned.andP;  If he immediately fires up Ventura again, the overaB token countis reduced; if he crashes too many times (which might happen during hardwareinstaUation) he can find himself unable to run Ventura at all.andP;  In the eventof a power failure, all your users may find they are locked out when powerreturns.andM;To defend against lost tokens, we learned to keep a backup copy of VP.SERfrom which we could restore the original token count.andP;  We also learned thatlost tokens will usually wander home on their own in five minutes or so.andO;(This may be small co to deadline-frantic users.) It should hardly ever bctsneccessary to rerun the registration process to restore the tokens.andM;Upgrading.andP;  You might want to add more users at a later time.andP;  While this isnot particularly hard, the Network Server manual gives incorrect instructionsfor the process.andP;  The steps are:andM;* Have all Ventura users on die network quit, then erase VP.SER from thenetwork's Ventura directory.andP;  If VP.SER is present, the registration programwon't run and wiU give a misleading error message.andM;* Gather all the #2 disks, both new and old.andP;  The registration program needsto verify that all numbers are unique.andM;* Run the SERNSTAL program, ignoring instructions in the manual.andP;  You mustregister all your disks, not just the new ones.andP;  Don't forget that theNetwork Server itself counts as one base program.andM;Although this is not a particularly onerous process, if you have a largeinstallation it can be rather boring to feed disk after disk to a computer.andO;As with all network administration tasks, it helps to plan your requirementsahead of time and to segment your network into smaller subnets that can betreated separately.andM;File managementandM;One of the most important functions of any multiuser computing system is tohelp manage the complexity that is inherent when groups of people interact indiverse ways.andP;  For a publishing operation, the system can and should help by:1) Treating a publication as a collection of component parts,andM;allowing specialists-writers, editors, proofreaders, artists, designers andso on-to contribute their separate strengths; 2) Keeping these specialistsfrom getting in each other's way; 3) Providing team members and managers withan overviewandM;of the current state of the publication and of each of its components.andM;Ventura Publisher handles item 1 pretty well; it has from the beginningtreated text files, graphics, styles and layouts as components to beassembled and polished.andP;  Any text editing done within Ventura is written backto the original file from which the text came in the original word-processorformat.andP;  (You can also choose to save it with a different format.) Stylesheets can be edited and saved for later reuse, and thc entire appearance ofa document can be overhauled by simply loading a new style sheet.andP;  Venturacan archive a chapter or multiple chapters together with all of theircomponents through a very simple and convenient  process.andM;Ventura's official policy for handling requirement 3 is that this is bestleft to third parties, since there are several mutually contradictory ways oftracking revisions and displaying management information.andP;  Thc Network Serverprovides a programming &quot;hook&quot; that third parties can tie into, in the form ofa chapter information file, Ventura uses the first record of this file forits own purposes and provides a protocol for the use of additional records.andO;There is a thriving industry of third-party companies adding value to VenturaPublisher, and we describe one such product on page 9.andP;  But as far as weknow, no one is offering network- aware versions yet.andM;However, when it comes to item 2, Ventura falls down on the job.andM;No file locking? Keeping multiple users out of each others's hair, incomputer terms, calls for file locking.andP;  When one user has a file open forediting, no other user should be able to edit that file.andP;  Any user whoattempts to edit an open file should be told that it is already being editedsomewhere else.andP;  He should then be able to view that file in read-only mode,to make copies of it, to find out who is editing it, and to send that user amessage.andM;Ventura's Network Server does indeed lock chapters, and it does allowread-only access to a chapter that is locked.andP;  But it fails to lock theeditable components of a chapter-thc text files and style sheets-with theresult that users can inadvertently corrupt each other's work.andM;Scenario for distress.andP;  To see how this can happen, suppose that there aretwo different chapter files which have a text file in common.andP;  (This isperfectly legal, and in fact it is a feature of Ventura Publisher.) User 1opens one document, and the Ventura program reads the text into memory.andP;  Atsome point while user 1 is working, user 2 opens the other document.andP;  TheVentura program reads in the same file that user 1 is working on, and user 2begins editing.andM;At some point, one of our two users will save his work.andP;  Ventura will notgive him any warning that another copy of his file has been opened forediting, so he assumes that all is safe.andP;  Later, the other user decides tosave her work.andP;  Ventura notices that the timestamp on the source file haschanged since it last looked, warns the user that someone else has modifiedthe file behind her back, and gives her the opportunity to cancel the save(skipping just that file) or to overwrite the other user's edits.andM;If she elects to overwrite, she will clobber someone else's work.andP;  In mostshops, that could lead to ill feeling amongst colleagues, to say the least.andO;The safest course is to cancel the save operation, then save the text under anew name.andP;  However, that means that there are now two versions of the text,which must be reconciled somehow.andM;Worse yet, the current version of Network Server has a bug: if our seconduser is saving as part of quitting the program, she will not even get theopportunity to save her file under a new name, because Ventura will exit toDOS immediately after it has saved the other components.andP;  She now has a truedilemma: clobber her own work or clobber someone else's.andM;Scenario for disaster.andP;  It gets worse.andP;  Suppose user 2 opens a text file withher word processing program while user 1 is working on the chapter thatcontains that text file.andP;  (Ventura says that allowing this to happen is aproductivity feature of the program, because one user can be designing thepages and styles while the other prepares die text.) If user 2 saves thechanges she makes with her word processor, Ventura will notice that thetimestamp on the text file has been altered, and give user 1 the chance tosave the text with a different name.andP;  But suppose it goes the other way: user1 saves first and quits, and then user 2 saves her work.andP;  The word processorhas no clue that someone else was working on the file-most MS-DOS wordprocessing programs are network-blind-so it just goes ahead and clobbers thefirst user's work.andP;  Neither user knows that this has happened, and they maynot find out until much later By that time, even the daily backup tape mayhave been overwritten.andM;Whose fault? Tempting as it may be to blast Ventura for these problems, thereisn't really much that Ventura can do to improve the situation, given thestrategic decision it has made to provide identical funtionality on Novell,PC Net and 3Com networks.andP;  The root of the file-locking problem is that theeasiest way to lock a file is to leave it open at all times, and on PC Net,that's the only way.andP;  But the memory constraints of DOS only allow aworkstation to have 20 or so files open at one time, while Ventura Publishercan include up to 128 files in one chapter Novell and 3Com provide anadditional mechanism: an application program can simply give the networkoperating system a list of files to keep locked until further notice.andP;  But PCNet, we were told, has no such facility.andM;Ventura is thus in the position of either providing inadequate userprotections or having to make network-specific versions of the program.andP;  Thelatter option would be tough for the distributors and retailers and hell onthe tech-support people at Xerox, who have enough trouble keeping up with thephone calls as it is.andM;More in sorrow than in anger, we conclude that Network Server users shouldtake what measures they can to defend themselves and hope that they don't gethurt too often.andM;Browsing.andP;  Venwra does allow you to open a chapter for readonly access.andP;  AllVentura operations work normany, except that you cannot save your work.andP;  Youcan edit the text, modify the styles, print the pages and so forth.andM;In this case, it seems that Ventura has gone a bit overboard in implementingread-only access.andP;  You cannot even save your changes under a difFerent name.andO;The SAVE, SAVE AS, and SAVE AS DIFF STYLE menus are all disabled.andP;  You askedfor read-only access, and that's all you are going to get.andP;  (In our opinion,while it is useful to be able to print a read-only file, you should not beable to edit it at all until you have saved it under a new name.)andM;Read-only styles.andP;  In some organizations, it is desirable to distribute amaster version of the corporate style sheet that cannot be modified except byauthorized personnel.andP;  The Network Server recognizes style sheets that havebeen marked for readonly access by the DOS ATTRIB command or the Novell FLAGcommand and treats them correctly.andM;First, it displays the style sheet's read-only status in the title bar at thetop of the Venwra window, right next to the name of the style sheet.andP;  Second,whenever you modify a style tag, you get a dialog warning you that you willnot be able to save your changes unless you save to a different style name.andM;This is a good approach, and one that we wish were the model for chapterbrowsing as well.andP;  It may be tedious to keep getting warnings, but better tobe safe than sorry.andP;  Besides, as soon as you save your modified style with adifferent name, you stop getting warnings.andM;However, we note that this may still not be foolproof.andP;  On a 3Com network, ifa user executes a SAVE AS DIFF STYLE command and (accidentally orintentionally) picks the name of the current read-only file, that file willbe overwritten.andP;  The newly written file will no longer have the read-onlyattribute.andP;  On a Novell network, the system will behave as though it iswriting the file, but it will not really do so.andP;  This is a lesser evil, inthat the user and the system are still protected from each other, butandM;Managing the publication processandM;Aside from archiving all the components of a publication in an orderly way,Ventura does little to help the user manage the publication process.andP;  Forthat maner, no desktop publishing program in today's market does very much.andO;We believe that this is an area in which the next generation of products willbe able to differentiate themselves from the herd.andM;There are several aspects to managing the production of a publication.andM;* job tracking.andP;  The publication manager needs to know where each part of thedocument is: In whose care is it? How nearly complete is it, and what stillneeds to be done with it? Where does it need to go next?andM;* Revision control.Is this the most up-to-date version of this file? Have thechanges been properly authorized, proofread, and communicated to all theconcerned parties?andM;* Layout planning.andP;  How much space on the page will each file take?andM;There are products in the desktop market that address each of these issues,but no product that we know of takes on aB three.andM;Desktop Manager.andP;  New Riders Publishing Company takes advantage of Ventura'schapter information files to track publication revisions and schedules withits Desktop Manager product.andP;  Desktop Manager behaves as a desk accessorywithin Ventura Publisher (it consumes only 8K of memory) and can be called tothe screen by a single keypress.andM;Desktop Manager offers several functions: * File handling, such as copying,deleting and renaming files.andP;  * Document control, including scheduling,revision history and staff assigmnents.andM;* Chapter description, including fists of the components of a chapter, alongwith their pathnames, timestamps and file sizes.andP;  You can place a144-character chapter description in the chapter information file and assignthe chapter to a category.andP;  You can quickly scan a fist of aU your style tagsand their properties.andM;* Printed reports (sent directly to the printer or formatted as a Venturadocument on disk) can be generated on aU this information.andM;* Timed backups assure that you don't forget to save your work in progress.andM;Alas, Desktop Manager does not work on a network.andP;  The current product makesassumptions about root directories and paths that don't hold up on a net.andP;  Wegot it to run after some finagling, but it still displayed severalnet-related bugs.andP;  New Riders says that several network-specific versions arebeing developed and should be ava il able before the end of the year.andM;Contact New Riders Publishing at P.O.andP;  Box 4846, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 orphone (818) 991-5392.andM;ODMS.andP;  Odesta Document Management System was introduced last fall at theSeybold Desktop Publishing Conference (see Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  ,3 page 30).andO;Although the initial vcrsion only runs on a Macintosh, there is no reason theprinciples could not be appled to an OS/2, Unix or maindrame product.andM;The best way to look at ODMS is to think of it as a layer of software betweenthe operating system and an application program.andP;  ODMS intercepts allre-opening and save commands, and thus it can maintain a database of thestate of each document in the system: who has it, the due data, who hasapproved it and so forth.andP;  In addition, the database contains aU the text andgraphics files themselves.andP;  Because the database is constantly andtransparently updated whenever users work on projects, ODMS can giveup-to-the-minute reports of management information, audit trails and securitychecks.andP;  (File locking is almost a trivial application of such a system.) Itcan also replace many paper-based job-traking schemes-job jackets, signoffsheets and so on.andM;ODMS is stiff undergoing development and refinement for high-end publishingapplications.andP;  It may be some time before it is marketed as a desktopproduct.andP;  Nonetheless, it is a very promising approach to the problems ofcorrdinating a wide variety of application programs (including those that arenetwork-blind) in a heterogeneous computing environment.andM;Bestinfo.andP;  Designed as a professional-quality multiuser publishing system,Bestinfo's Wave4 program provides many of the file management features wewant.andP;  (For a review of Wave4, see The Seybold Report on Publishling System,VoL 18, No.andP;  11.) The system has several components:andM;* PageWright is a pagination program that, like Ventura Publisher, is basedon sames and style tags.andP;  (However, it is very different in overall look andfeel; in particular, it is far too slow to resemble Ventura.) A keydifference is that each frame in PageWright has a name that other Bestinfoprograms can use to obtain column width and depth.andM;* WordWright is essentially XyWrite III+ running under a &quot;shell&quot; program.andO;The shell provides file locking, copy flow and routing; it guarantees thatrenames will be unique across multiple directories; and it maintains a &quot;jobticket&quot; file with revision-control information.andP;  It also allows you to handamp;j aXyWrite file to exactly the same parameters that PageWright will use,provided you assign the correct style sheet and tell it which frame tocompose for.andP;  The depth informattion is recorded in the job ticket.andP;  Thuswriters can fit their stories exactly into assigned spaces, and a page editorcan tell exactly how much space a given story will need.andM;* Utility programs are available to generate reports based on job ticketinformation, even across multiple network directories, as weU as to archiveentire publications and so forth.andM;Because Bestinfo provides all these components itself, does not allow&quot;foreign&quot; word processors, and specifies Novel Netware as the mandatorynetwork operating system, it is able to provide system security and filemanagement with a high level of fimctionality, even on an AT-class computerrunning MS-DOS.andP;  It also commands a goodly price; a single PageWright licensecosts about $13,000.andM;FuturesandM;Ventura Software previewed an OS/2 version of Ventura Pubfisher atComdex/Spring and expects to ship it this fall.andP;  Some of the new features itwill offer come &quot;for free&quot; as a result of running in the multitasking OS/2environment; for example, multiple execution threads will make the programseem faster, because printing and off-screen updating can be done asbackground tasks.andM;The OS/2 version will allow users to cut and paste text between Ventura andother applications, using the system clipboard.andP;  You will be able to havemultiple Ventura sessions in separate windows, and in addition to moving textbetween diem, you will be able to copy and paste groups of style tags.andM;And, of course, we expect that the re-locking problem will be alleviated.andO;For one thing, the removal of MS-DOS's memory constraints will allowVentura's prograrnmers to take the steps that need to be taken to preventfile collisions.andP;  For another, we expect that nearly all OS/2 programs willbe written to be network-aware.andM;ConclusionandM;Ventura's Network Server is a major step in the maturation of the desktoppublishing industry.andP;  Heretofore, desktop publishing has invariably meantsingle-user systems, perhaps augmented by local area networks as filerepositories, But because serious publishers require a team approach togetting jobs out on time, a product oriented toward networked, multiuserproduction is welcome indeed.andM;Alas, the Network Server is flawed by imperfect file integrity.andP;  Without aueand complete file locking, users can inadvertently trash each other's work.andO;Of course, most users will rarely fall afoul of the scenarios we describedabove.andP;  But we suspect they will be mightily annoyed when (not if) thcy do.andM;In other words, the Network Server is network- aware, but not fullynetwork-friendly.andP;  This is better than the earlier, network-blind versions ofVentura Publisher, but it is not sufficient.andM;We acknowledge that Ventura could hardly have done much better under theconstraints of the current product.andP;  To run under MS-DOS (in thc company ofother MS-DOS programs that are network-blind) and to present thc samefunctionality on each of the three networks, Ventura had to take aleast-coffimon-denominator approach.andP;  Unfortunately, that isn't good enoughfor users whose liverhoods depend upon the reliability of their publishingsystcm.andM;Our conclusion, therefore, must be that MS-DOS itself is simply not anadequate platform upon which to base a multiuser product of Ventura's scope.andO;Ventura's programmer, may find ways to minimize the problems, but we don'tthink that they can do away with them without giving up some other objective,such as network independence.andM;Network Server is a taste of what may soon arrive in the OS/2 world, but itis not yet an industrial-strength solution to the problems of seriouspublishers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
