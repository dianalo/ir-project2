The nomination of Bjoern Engholm ended a week-long search for anew leader to renew the party, which has been dealt threesuccessive electoral defeats at the hands of Chancellor HelmutKohl's Christian Democrats.   Both chancellor candidate Oskar Lafontaine and current partychief Hans-Jochen Vogel had declined to lead the Social Democratsafter the defeat in the Dec. 2 parliamentary vote.   The Social Democrats are the country's second largest politicalforce and the oldest political party in Germany.   But with Lafontaine as chancellor candidate and Vogel at thehead of the party, they won just 33.5 percent of the votenationwide in the first free elections in united Germany in 58years.   The left-leaning party fared poorly, winning about 23 percent,in the five new eastern states that were carved out of East Germanyfollowing unity on Oct. 3.   The cautious, 51-year-old Engholm, dubbed ``the beautifulBjoern'' for his dapper dressing, is a study in contrast with theharsh, outspoken Lafontaine.   As Kohl's push for speedy German unity accelerated this year,Lafontaine alienated voters by issuing negative statements aboutunity. Engholm said he found Lafontaine's style off-putting.   Engholm told ZDF television his task would be to bring theSocial Democrats back to the center of society. He said that hewould consult with leading artists and intellectuals on the party'sfuture course.   Engholm indicated he would retain his elected office as premierof Germany's northernmost state, largely rural Schleswig-Holstein.   Vogel said the party leadership had unanimously agreed onEngholm's nomination as chairman. The candidacy must be formallyapproved at a party congress scheduled for May. Lafontaine hasremained out of view since losing the election.   Engholm said he wanted to bring a new generation of SocialDemocratic politicians to the forefront in time for 1994parliamentary elections.   An education minister under the former West German government ofHelmut Schmidt, he has already proven his own electoral resilience.   In 1987, Engholm was the victim of a smear campaign whilerunning for premier of Schleswig-Holstein.   Christian Democrat Uwe Barschel won the vote but resigned 12days later after an aide revealed he was ordered to leak claimsthat Engholm cheated on his taxes and was bisexual.   A day before Barschel was to have appeared before aninvestigatory panel, he was found dead in a Geneva hotel, anapparent suicide.   Engholm was elected state premier in new elections on May 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
