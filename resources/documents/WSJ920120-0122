I am the executive director of the Y-ME NationalOrganization for Breast Cancer Information and Support -- thelargest breast-cancer support program in the country. Formore than 10 years, Y-ME has been offering peer counseling tothousands of women concerned about breast-related problems.</LP><TEXT>   The majority of women who opt to have breastreconstruction or augmentation do not make this decisionlightly. Thousands of women have called the Y-ME nationalhotline during the past year asking questions about siliconebreast implants.   Who are these women and why have so many of them rebuilttheir bodies? As can be expected, many of our callers arebreast cancer survivors. They have faced breast loss, a yearor two of chemotherapy, and some have had their chestsradiated. They face each day hoping that they have overcomecancer. Many no longer want to be reminded every morning andnight of the cancer that played havoc with their bodies.   It is estimated that one-third of current breast cancerpatients are having reconstruction, most often with siliconeimplants. Saline implants can be an alternative, but they arenot as aesthetically pleasing. An estimated 20% of implantsare performed to reconstruct the breast; the rest, foraugmentation. Y-ME's most recent survey (October 1991) of itsown Hotline counselors -- all breast cancer survivors --showed that among the respondents who had implants, theoverwhelming majority were satisfied with their implants and87% believed the devices helped their emotional recovery.   Y-ME Hotline counselors also indicated that, of thehundreds of women they have talked to with implants, 71% arevery satisfied, 28% are moderately satisfied and only 1%dissatisfied with these products. In addition, 89% of therespondents believe that silicone implants should remain aviable option for any woman who wants them, as long as thewoman is informed of the risks and benefits.   But what about the healthy woman who wants her breastsaugmented? These women, too, have begun to call our hotlinebecause they have no place else to voice their frustrationover the current controversy over whether silicone breastimplants are safe. I have talked to many of these women.Their stories are varied, most deal with self-image andself-confidence, and their experiences clearly show thatimplants made a positive difference in their lives. Theircomments have made me and the counselors at Y-ME realize thatbreast implants are a concern not only for cancer patientsbut for all women.   I believe women and their emotions are being held hostageby the current circus surrounding the review process. Womenhave waited more than a year for the Food and DrugAdministration to make a final ruling on the safety andeffectiveness of these devices. The FDA advisory panel'srecommendations made last November tying implant availabilityto further research gave FDA Commissioner David Kessler astrong mandate to get answers to lingering questions and tobreak new ground with an official registry and an enforcedinformed-consent process.   Instead, Dr. Kessler issued a voluntary moratorium onsilicone implants and will be reconvening a panel that hasalready been compromised by conflicting internal memorandumsand innuendo. His reason for this action was new evidence,still unreleased, that he claims questions the safety ofthese products.   Once again, women and their doctors have been left in thedark as a government bureaucracy and a politically ambivalentadministrator refuse to make a firm decision after more thana year of reviewing the evidence.   Y-ME's position is clear and simple. If silicone breastimplants can be scientifically proved dangerous, then thisinformation should be made available to women. If the dataare inconclusive, we demand full disclosure of allinformation so women can make decisions based on fact and noton unscientific claims and anecdotes. We also understand thatno medical device can be guaranteed 100% safe and that somepeople are willing to take greater risks to improve thequality of their lives. However, it should be a personalchoice based on all the medically verified evidence as it isknown today.   Millions of women have chosen oral contraceptives toprevent unwanted pregnancies. They choose them well awarethat the known risks for these pills include blood clots,heart attacks and strokes, gallbladder disease, liver tumors,water retention, mood changes, dizziness and nausea (from theFDA booklet Current Issues in Women's Health).   To ban or severely limit silicone breast implants based oninconclusive data would be one more insult to women by takingaway their right to make informed decisions regarding theirown bodies. For others to deny the right of a woman toimplants because they fundamentally believe implants areunnecessary is arrogance in its ugliest form.   ---   Ms. Green is executive director of Y-ME NationalOrganization for Breast Cancer Information and Support, inHomewood, Ill.</TEXT></DOC>
