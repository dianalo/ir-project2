Miguel d'Escoto met reporters after talking to Secretary-GeneralJavier Perez de Cuellar about a proposed international militaryobserver force to police the Central American peace plan.   D'Escoto is leading a meeting Wednesday and Thursday of foreignministers of Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, Guatemala and ElSalvador, which signed the 1987 peace plan.   ``We will be proposing an agreement between the Central Americanrepublics and the United States on the elimination of illegal drugtrafficking,'' said d'Escoto.   ``This is a scourge on the world; we were very, very happy to seethe priority that President Bush gave to this issue in his inauguraladdress,'' he said.   The United States backs the rebels seeking to overthrow theleftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. But the Nicaraguangovernment has spoken in favor of improving relations with theUnited States since the change in U.S. administrations last month.   D'Escoto said Nicaragua is volunteering to draft an agreementthat would be submitted to the other Central American countries andthe United States, followed by a meeting of those involved inManagua.   D'Escoto would not provide other details of the proposal anddeclined to say whether Nicaragua would be prepared to shareintelligence data or coast guard duties with the United States.   ``We would be proposing to go as far as we should go in order toreally stamp out this diabolical sourge to humanity,'' he said.   Panama, which is ruled by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noreiga, isconsidered part of South America, not Central America.   Noreiga has been charged with drug trafficking in U.S. federalcourts, but says the charges are false and are an attempt to lay thegroundwork for abrogating the treaty under which control of thePanama Canal will pass from the United States to Panama.   Nicaragua has defended Noriega, saying he is a victim of U.S.persecution intended to undermine Panama's sovereignty.   The Central American foreign ministers are meeting in New York toset the agenda for a summit meeting of their five presidents Feb.13-14 in El Salvador to try to revive the peace plan.   The peace initiative, which calls for democratic reforms inCentral American countries, has stalled over the lack of fullcompliance by its signers.</TEXT></DOC>
