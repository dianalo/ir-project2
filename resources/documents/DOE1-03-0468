The study on the heterogeneouschemical interactions between the air pollutants and the gaseous substancesis behind those studies. The problem of acid rain arose around northEurope in the late 1960's. it was found that the acid rain was causedby the contribution of water drops and solid particles to the oxydationof SO{sub 2} in the atmosphere. The important roles of heterogeneouschemical reactions between the gaseous pollutants and the water dropssuch as cloud, fog and rain drops taking place in the troposphere havebeen reviewed. They include oxydation of SO{sub 2}, conversion of nitrogenoxides, and conversion and decomposition of organic compounds. (20 figs,11 tabs, 110 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
