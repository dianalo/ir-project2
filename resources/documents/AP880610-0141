(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former sheriff has been sentenced tothree years in prison and ordered to pay $3,000 in restitutionfollowing his guilty to plea to taking payoffs from two gamblingcompanies.   Roy Sandefer, 53, who pleaded guilty Jan. 5 to accepting thepayoffs and failing to report the income on his 1986 tax return,was ordered Thursday to report to federal authorities July 11 tobegin his term.   Sandefer's sentence included a three-year term for the briberycharge and a one-year, concurrent term for the tax evasion charge.   Sandefer's plea bargain with federal prosecutors didn't includea condition that he not seek office when his sentence is completed,Assistant U.S. Attorney John Hailman said.   ``But as a practical matter, having been convicted of bribery,he probably could not get elected again,'' Hailman said.   The sheriff had served one term, which ended in January.   Sandefer had faced a maximum 13 years in prison and $350,000 infines.   According to authorities, the former sheriff received $500monthly payoffs for allowing two amusement companies to install andoperate gambling machines in Lee County.   He was indicted on charges of bribery, extortion, conspiracy toobstruct law enforcement, aiding an illegal gambling operation andfiling false tax returns.   Federal prosecutors dropped all charges but two in making theagreement under which Sandefer pleaded guilty. He also agreed tocooperate with federal authorities.   Before his sentence was announced, Sandefer told U.S. DistrictJudge L.T. Senter Jr.: ``I never told them they owed me a dime. Ido admit I took their gratuities.''</TEXT></DOC>
