The U.S. publication of Salman Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses'' _a novel some consider blasphemous _ is to many of the nation'sestimated 3.5 million Moslems only the latest example of howacceptable anti-Moslem prejudice has become in America.   ``The eight years they lived under Reagan were not easy years.The enemy moved from being the `evil empire' of the Soviet Union toIslam,'' said Yvonne Haddad, a professor of Islamic history at theUniversity of Massachusetts at Amherst. ``I've seen the prejudice.It's almost American to bash Islam.''   Nor has their exclusion from the American religious landscapeended with Reagan's departure, according to Moslem leaders. Therewere neither Moslem participants nor any mention of Islam at aninterfaith National Prayer Service after President Bush'sinauguration.   ``We felt a bit insulted but blamed it on their ignorance ratherthan discourtesies,'' said Mohammed Mehdi, a co-chairman of theNorth American Interfaith Network and secretary general of theNational Council on Islamic Affairs. The service was organized by aNational Day of Prayer and Thanksgiving committee.   Ever since interfaith support was drummed up for World War I,with Protestant, Catholic and Jewish leaders showing unprecedentedcooperation, the portrait of the nation as consisting of three basicfaiths has been implanted in the public mind.   Moslems have settled in America since the 19th century, buttremendous growth did not take place until the 1960s and 1970s whenrelaxed immigration rules and a jump in Islamic students related tothe oil boom coincided with a movement by blacks to Islam.   No one knows how many Moslems there are in the U.S. _ estimatesrange from 2 million to 10 million _ but many scholars and religiousleaders say Haddad's estimate of between 3 million and 4 million isthe most reliable.   If that estimate is correct, there are more Moslems in the UnitedStates than two of the nation's most influential denominations, the3 million-member Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and the 2.5million-member Episcopal Church.   Because of higher rates of immigration, births and conversionsamong Moslems, there also is substantial agreement with Haddad'sassessment that if current demographic trends continue the nation'sMoslem population will be larger than the Jewish population``possibly by 2000, definitely by 2015.'' The nation's Jewishpopulation is estimated at 5.9 million.   But growing numbers have not meant growing respect for Moslems,who still must contend with public perceptions of them ranging from``camel jockeys'' to more dangerous stereotypes fostered by Americananger over Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Iran.   ``The amazing thing about it is that they persist soperversely,'' said Marston Speight, director of the Office ofChristian-Moslem Relations for the National Council of Churches.``Everywhere I go, no matter what I say, people always come up withthe stereotype of Islam being a fanatically aggressive type ofreligion.''   Speight said the ethical principles of peace and mercy in theKoran, the sacred book of Moslems, ``simply belie the negative,militant, violent image.'' He said violent acts committed in thename of Islam have parallels in Christian history, but ``morally andethically, Islam and Christianity and Judaism are on common ground.''   Many religious groups have made improved relations with Moslems apriority.   John Borrelli, executive secretary of the Office forInterreligious Relations of the U.S. Catholic Conference, saidCatholic-Moslem dialogue is going on in cities such as Los Angelesand New York and he expects more meetings and discussions nationally.   Rabbi James Rudin of the American Jewish Committee said the ``thetest of American religion in the 21st century'' will be its abilityto integrate other religious groups such as Moslems.   ``If we fail, if we cannot have a mutually respectful society,then we can end up with religious, sectarian strife, and Godforbid,'' he said, adding that his organization has increasedefforts to have contacts with Moslems.   Mehdi said that with the exception of unofficial, isolatedletters from Christian fundamentalists who label Moslems``heathens,'' the ``overwhelming number of established religionshave been supportive.''   But discrimination persists, he and others contend.   Haddad said since 1985, mosques have been bombed in Philadelphiaand Indianapolis, and others have been desecrated.   The publication of ``The Satanic Verses'' ``showed Moslems arenot perceived as being part and parcel of American society, and aremisunderstood,'' said Brother Ihsan Babgy, education director forthe Islamic Society of North America in Plainfield, Ind.   Rushdie has said the book is a work of fiction that was notintended to offend anyone. Viking Penguin, the book's U.S.publisher, has said its position is ``freedom of speech, freedom topublish and freedom to read must be guaranteed internationally.''   But the turmoil caused by the book may have long-term benefitsfor American Moslems, according to officials here.   ``The atmosphere has changed remarkably in recent times. Thiswhole issue of `Satanic Verses' is pushing us together more,'' Babgysaid. ``I think there is a clear and dramatic unification of Moslemsin this country.''   Since the controversy developed, Mehdi said, his office hasreceived about 20 calls from people who used obscene language toexpress their point of view, and four times as many calls frompeople wanting to find out more about Islam.</TEXT></DOC>
