Iown it free and clear, but it is too much work for me to maintain. I have anice income and good investments so I don't need cash from the sale. Itoccurred to me that I can sell my home for a 10 to 20 percent down payment andthen carry back a mortgage for the balance for 10 years or so. What do youthink of this idea? If you like it, how much interest should I charge?;    AAn installment sale will be ideal for your situation. It can increase yourretirement income. Additional benefits include being able to make a quick,easy sale for top dollar.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Home  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  INSTALLMENT HOME SALE SUGGESTED  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Real EstateRobert J. Bruss is a real estate attorney in San Francisco.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Home sellers who can finance their sale usually have no trouble sellingtheir property.;    Since I presume you are 55 or older and qualify for the&quot;over 55 rule&quot; $125,000 home sale tax exemption, up to $125,000 of your saleprofits will be tax-free.;    However, the interest income is taxable asordinary income. In today's market you should be able to get 9 to 10 percentinterest on your mortgage.;    That makes a nice safe investment for you at ahigher yield than you can probably earn elsewhere with equal safety. Forfurther details, please consult your tax adviser.;    Q When my job wasrecently transferred, we had to sell our old home and buy a new one. Sellingthe old home was no problem, thankfully, because my employer's corporaterelocation company bought it. But we looked at dozens of homes before findingone we both liked.;    When it can time to write up our purchase offer bid,the real estate agent wrote: &quot;All cash to seller, buyer to obtain maximummortgage available.&quot;;    But my wife insisted on spelling out the details ofthe mortgage we wanted, such as the amount, interest rate, fees, term andevery little detail. That almost caused us to lose the house because theseller felt we might not be able to get that mortgage. But everything turnedout well and we are now moved into our new home. Do you think it was a mistaketo include the finance details in our purchase offer?;    A No. Your wife wasabsolutely correct to insist on including a detailed mortgage finance clausein your purchase offer.;    If she had accepted the one suggested by the realestate agent then you would have been obligated to buy even if you had notbeen able to obtain the mortgage you wanted. Congratulations to your wife.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Robert J.
