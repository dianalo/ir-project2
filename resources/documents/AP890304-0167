The relentless development of new shopping sites probably willease as the baby-boom bulge of the U.S. population grows older, butit still continues.   Too many of the stores springing up are the same, lacking theflare they'd need to stand out in an overpopulated retail landscape,analysts say. And not enough stores that supply do-it-yourselfhousehold gear or cater to the needs of older people are beingbuilt, contrary to what demographic trends indicate are needed, theynote.   Karen Sack, a retailing analyst with Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.,says the nation's big retailers went on an expansion binge in the1960s and '70s, boosting growth by opening more and more stores.   ``Growth no longer works'' as a way of winning market share, saysSack, who came up with the U.S. per capita estimate of retail spaceusing figures from the International Council of Shopping Centers.   Price is the highest priority for many consumers when choosingwhere to shop. Service also is important, but probably less so.   The success of discounters that are threatening to topple Sears,Roebuck and Co. from the head of the retail league table, such as KMart Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., illustrates the significanceconsumers attach to finding what they feel are fair prices.   Periodic markdowns, even drastic ones, aren't a guarantee ofgaining a faithful customer following, either.   ``Sales don't work anymore,'' Sack says. ``Nobody pays full pricefor things anymore and a lot of stores have lost credibility byannouncing sales and then not having the goods available, so theyhave to give rain checks.''   Promising a ``sale that never ends,'' Sears opened its doors on anew low-price policy this past week.   Advertising on television, radio and in newspapers dramatized theunprecedented shift in strategy by the retailer, which now is in itssecond century of operation.   The retailing giant shut down all of its stores across thecountry for 42 hours to mobilize thousands of workers to slash pricetags on 50,000 items.   When the more than 800 Sears, Roebuck stores across the countryreopened at noon Wednesday, customers flocked in to see forthemselves what the hoopla was about. As human nature would have it,some were thrilled by the bargains, others weren't.   Sears hopes to keep them coming back by pursuing an ``everydaylow prices'' policy. It has vowed to meet competitors' prices; ifcustomers bring in another store's advertisement with a lower pricethan Sears has on an identical item, Sears will match it.Supervisors have been ordered to shop at rival retailers todetermine what they are charging.   It won't be clear for months whether Sears' ideas for maintainingits pre-eminent position in the retail industry is working.Shoppers, even more cost-conscious now that interest rates are onthe rise, will cast the deciding vote.   ``The consumer is very smart,'' says Sack. ``They'll decidewhether they really feel if they're getting good value.''   In other business this past week:   _Morton Thiokol Inc., manufacturer of the solid rocket motors forthe Challenger space shuttle, which exploded after liftoff Jan. 28,1986 killing seven astronauts, announced a major realignment. Itsthriving specialty chemicals business, including the Morton saltbusiness, will be spun off from its troubled aerospace operation.   _ RJR Nabisco Inc. snuffed out its ``smokeless'' cigarette afterspending millions of dollars during almost a decade of research. Thecompany said it was pulling the controversial cigarette off storeshelves, ending five-month trials in test markets. The Premier brandwas condemned to death partly because smokers said it tastedterrible.   _A series of reports suggested the economy remains strong butrising interest rates may be affecting consumer spending. TheCommerce Department said the Index of Leading Economic Indicators,the government's chief gauge of future economic activity, went up ahealthy 0.6 percent in January. Another department report saidpersonal income gained 1.8 percent in January, while growth inpersonal consumption expenditures slowed to 0.1 percent.</TEXT><NOTE>End Advance for Weekend Editions</NOTE></DOC>
