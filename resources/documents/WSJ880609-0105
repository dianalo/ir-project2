Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   It ought to be a close election between Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis, The Wall Street Journal's panel of four political sages agrees.    But there's one thing that could change that -- Mr. Bush.    &quot;It's Bush's, to win or to lose,&quot; says Republican strategist John Sears. &quot;He can win it if he comes forward and tells the voters what he wants to do and where he wants to lead the country.&quot;    But, says Kevin Phillips, the panel's other Republican sage, the vice president may not be able to do that. &quot;He has shown this inability to get through a week without saying something like a 16-year-old at Andover. It's a joke.&quot; Andover is Mr. Bush's old prep school.    &quot;Conservative presidents,&quot; says Alan Baron, a Democratic analyst, &quot;usually come from the lower middle class. Bush is upper class and conservative. I think it's dangerous.&quot;    Pollster Peter Hart, the other Democratic sage, says Mr. Bush &quot;doesn't seem to connect to the average person. He keeps saying he wants to be the education president, which is a little like Joan Collins saying she wants to be a serious actress.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis clinched the Democratic nomination Tuesday by winning primaries in California, New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico. Mr. Bush nailed down his party's nomination back on March 8, Super Tuesday.    The four sages joined Wall Street Journal reporters and editors for the third in an occasional series of lunch meetings this year to discuss how the presidential campaign is going.    They generally agree that Mr. Dukakis has emerged from his party's nominating struggle in better shape than most people had expected, but that most voters still don't know very much about him.    He was &quot;lucky,&quot; says Mr. Phillips, because he defeated the Rev. Jesse Jackson, widely perceived as someone who is, or was, a radical. It tends to make Mr. Dukakis look moderate, helping him with white ethnics who voted for Ronald Reagan four years ago.    By any objective consideration, the experts agree, Mr. Bush should win the election handily. The nation is at peace and the economy remains reasonably healthy.    But there are undercurrents. &quot;When we ask people if the country is moving in the right direction or if it's off on the wrong track, by a margin of five to three they say the wrong track,&quot; Mr. Hart points out. &quot;They're not confident things are going to be better for their children,&quot; adds Mr. Phillips.    Mr. Bush, says Mr. Sears, should be talking about the future, working on the basis that &quot;the country is relatively satisfied.&quot; Instead, says Mr. Phillips, &quot;the Bush campaign looks at politics through a rear-view mirror,&quot; by summoning up George McGovern and Jimmy Carter as &quot;ghosts of the past.&quot; The Bush strategy is simply &quot;to take the other fellow (Mr. Dukakis) apart,&quot; he says.    There are charges to be brought against Mr. Dukakis, says Mr. Sears, but he says the vice president doesn't have the credibility to make them, until he makes the case for himself.    Meanwhile, the national debate surges around drugs, the deficit and corruption, serious problems but perhaps not so compelling as war or economic disaster. If those are going to be the issues upon which the election is decided, predicts Mr. Sears, the Republicans likely will lose.    The panelists agree that one of the surprises in the campaign, so far, is that Mr. Dukakis has come across as more competent than Mr. Bush. This, says Mr. Baron, is a turnaround, for Republicans, win or lose, almost always are perceived as better managers than Democrats.    In 1952, Mr. Baron says, Dwight Eisenhower's subtle message was not that he was going to dismantle the New Deal but that he would manage it better than the Democrats. Similarly, he suggests, Mr. Dukakis may convey the impression this year that he can manage the Reagan &quot;revolution&quot; better than Vice President Bush.    Another surprise: The panelists agree that so far Mr. Dukakis comes across as tougher than Mr. Bush. &quot;Dukakis seems comfortable with himself and who he is,&quot; says Mr. Hart. &quot;There's a certain toughness there. It's the opposite with George Bush. He always undoes himself. 'That was Tension City,' he says, after the TV showdown with Dan Rather. You're always afraid there's going to be a meltdown.&quot;    But, the panelists agree, Mr. Dukakis has some potential problems of his own.    Mr. Baron cautions that the Democrats &quot;need a massive shift of votes&quot; to win the election. They've been picking up only a little more than 40% of the vote in the last two presidential elections. Thus they need almost 10 more points to win the two-way race, no simple challenge; historically, such a shift from one election to the next has seldom occurred.    Mr. Dukakis, they also note, hasn't been fully tested so far in a national setting. But, they agree, he does seem to be more error-free than most candidates.    A big chink in Mr. Dukakis's armor may be foreign policy. &quot;It's a middling Achilles heel,&quot; says Mr. Phillips. Mr. Jackson, he thinks, may push him too far in an area in which he doesn't have much expertise.    Mr. Bush ought to run with that, for his foreign-policy resume is extensive, says Mr. Sears. &quot;Relations with Russia are not like the way they used to be. What does this mean? The Democrats, on trade issues, are moving to protectionism. Should people worry about that?    &quot;It would be so refreshing if George Bush would just stand up and say, 'I think,' and then fill in the blanks,&quot; Mr. Sears says.    The sages aren't convinced that the running mates to be chosen by the two candidates will make a big difference. But they have some thoughts about it.    Mr. Phillips says the Democrats ought to pick Ohio Sen. John Glenn and aim their campaign at northern and border states. Mr. Sears recommends Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey. Mr. Baron proposes Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen because &quot;he would drive George Bush bananas.&quot; (Sen. Bentsen defeated Mr. Bush in the 1970 Senate race in Texas.)    As for Republican running mates, Mr. Hart and Mr. Baron, the two Democrats, recommend former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander as Mr. Bush's running mate, a notion that elicits groans from the two Republican sages. They both agree a woman would help the GOP ticket but they can't think of anyone with political credentials convincing enough to overcome suspicions that she was chosen simply because she is a woman. </TEXT></DOC>
