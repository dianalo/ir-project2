All over the country, regional Bell companies are beefing up their directory campaigns as Donnelley Directories and other rivals make more inroads. In some of the biggest markets, including Chicago and Washington, the Bells even fight each other for dominance.    Survey Sampling Inc. says its latest polls indicate that 20 of the 80 largest urban markets have become yellow pages battlegrounds. In these cities, consumers consult rival telephone directories at least 20% of the time. One of the hottest contests is in Orlando, Fla., where a joint venture of Dun andamp; Bradstreet's Donnelley Directory unit and United Telecommunications Inc. is running neck and neck with BellSouth Corp.    Initially, the catalyst for competition was the decree that broke up the Bell System in 1984. Among other things, it allowed the regional companies to publish a wide variety of printed directories and even to invade each other's publishing territories. These businesses were reclassified as &quot;unregulated,&quot; meaning that government couldn't impose ceilings on their profits.    But that same decree also prohibited the Bells from entering such adjacent businesses as electronic listings and so-called talking yellow pages. Now non-Bell rivals in New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and elsewhere are moving aggressively to exploit the ban.    What's more, the stakes have risen and the battle's intensity has escalated in recent months. The Bells and their rivals are realizing that the potential rewards, as measured by revenue and profit growth, are greater than they once imagined. Grabbing for bigger pieces of that growth, many are hurriedly dropping old partners and forging new alliances.    &quot;The whole industry is in a state of turmoil,&quot; says Sydney Gross, director of corporate planning for BellSouth's L.M. Berry andamp; Co. unit, which sells ads for directory publishers. &quot;This used to be a quiet business, one in which you almost didn't worry about competition.&quot;    At Chicago-based Ameritech, revenue derived from directory publishing rose 13% in 1987, compared with overall revenue growth for the company of less than 2%. Ameritech's enterprise group, of which directory publishing is a major part, contributed more than half of the parent company's $50 million profit increase last year. For St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell Corp., the directories business contributed about $92 million of net earnings in 1987, about 12.5% of total profit.    Eventually, consumers stand to benefit from the better phonebook designs and the more-innovative marketing approaches. But so far, the results have been mostly bewildering. As directories proliferate, so do their slogans: The Smart Yellow Pages. The Real Yellow Pages. The Yellow Pages and Much, Much More. Indeed, the heightened competition has brought major shifts in alliances between publishers and their marketing agents.    For example, BellSouth's Berry unit recently was dropped as the exclusive marketing agent for longtime customer Rochester Telephone Corp. BellSouth blames its inability to offer electronic services to its unaffiliated customers. The unit's Mr. Gross describes the lost relationship as &quot;an emotional hit.&quot;    Advertisers also feel torn. &quot;It's like buying jewelry. It's hard to tell what you're getting,&quot; says Steven E. Permut, head of Marketing Sciences Inc., a New Haven, Conn., market research firm. &quot;With the yellow pages, an advertiser has to make a decision that lasts for a year. Most decide it is better to over-advertise than under-advertise.&quot;    Directory publishers, meanwhile, continue to shop for profitable niches. Some churn out neighborhood directories, while others print separate phonebooks for women, blacks, Hispanics and Asians. At least one provides a directory for coin collectors. Nynex Corp. offers a series of boaters' guides packaged in zippered plastic bags.    In all, more than 6,000 directories are published by about 200 publishers. Advertising revenues, estimated at $7.3 billion a year, are collected mostly by the Bells, Donnelley, GTE Corp.'s directory unit and United Telecommunications.    Electronic yellow pages could trigger an explosion of the industry. But the Bells are barred from providing such listings, and few see that segment of the industry taking off without them.    For now, &quot;talking&quot; yellow pages are considered the cutting edge. Gary Reeves, senior vice president and general manager of Donnelley's mid-Atlantic region, says the audiotex service is popular among advertisers in Philadelphia and Central Florida, and the company plans to expand its use. Consumers dial a number along with a special code to receive a recorded message that could include information on an advertiser's latest sale or new business hours.    &quot;It's a way to update an ad that otherwise would remain unchanged for a full year,&quot; says Fred E. Smykla, executive director emeritus of the Yellow Pages Publishers Association, formed in May when two industry associations merged. Recorded messages, says Mr. Smykla, can help the industry compete with newspaper, radio and other advertising vehicles.    Such offerings also provide a way for a directory company to differentiate its book from others. Donnelley is trying to do just that in Philadelphia, where it had been Bell of Pennsylvania's exclusive sales agent until 1986.    When contract talks with the Bell Atlantic Corp. unit broke off over differences in strategy, Donnelley decided to publish a competing directory. Similarly, Donnelley's arrangement with Bell Atlantic Corp.'s Chesapeake andamp; Potomac unit collapsed as Candamp;P teamed up with GTE. Last month, Donnelley and Southwestern Bell announced plans for a joint venture to publish directories in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore.    The new directories, called The One Book, will succeed Southwestern Bell's Metropolitan Yellow Pages. The strategy is to publish one regional directory for each market in competition with Candamp;P, which puts out several books for the cities and their suburbs.    Donnelley's Mr. Reeves says his organization has &quot;an excellent customer base with the local advertising community, and had intended to publish a competing directory&quot; until the Southwestern Bell venture was arranged.    Bell Atlantic, meanwhile, has formed a partnership with GTE Directory Sales Corp., a GTE unit, to sell ads. And to give its books a twist, Bell Atlantic is testing an audiotex service provided by BDR Audiotex Inc. of Ontario, Canada. Many of the Bell Atlantic directories will include a phone number that can be used to obtain such information as sports scores, local events, weather and stock market reports. The Bells are barred from providing the content of such information services themselves, but they can transmit the data for others.    Southwestern Bell, which publishes directories in 44 states and has several foreign publishing ventures, appears to be regrouping after it scrapped its Silver Pages this spring. The Silver Pages targeted older persons in nearly 100 markets, but flopped because older people and advertisers found no need for special listings of &quot;senior citizen&quot; discounts.    The Silver Pages isn't the first example of overkill. In Orange County, Calif., for instance, some residents find as many as 15 directories on the doorstep.    To make sure their directories aren't tossed out with the trash, publishers are trying to make their books more appealing. Nynex, for instance, hopes free samples will catch the fancy of advertisers and consumers.    The company's Information Resources unit is going after national and regional firms that traditionally shun the yellow pages, using a direct-marketing program that allows advertisers to distribute product samples, coupons, brochures and other promotional materials with Nynex yellow pages. It will begin testing the program from Nashville-based Directa Inc. next year.    Pacific Telesis Group's Pacific Bell unit, facing a steady 3% decline in use of its yellow pages and a troubling competitive situation, hired graphic designer Richard Saul Wurman to develop &quot;Smart Yellow Pages.&quot; The books contain detailed community information on such topics as what to do in an earthquake, along with clearer indexing and bolder headings.    The redesign cost about 7.5 cents a book. That's about $2.4 million for the 32 million directories Pacific Bell distributes each year. Before the redesign, Pacific Bell printed a total of about 31 billion pages a year. It's now up to 39 billion.    The company even scrapped the walking fingers -- a logotype that was never registered by American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and now is used on many Bell and non-Bell directories. Instead, Pacific Bell has adopted a logo of running fingers and the message: &quot;Let your fingers do the running.&quot;    Explains John Gaulding, who initiated the project shortly after taking over Pacific Bell Directory in 1986: &quot;We've copyrighted that -- aggressively.&quot;    ---         Estimated 1987 Directory Publishing Revenue     BellSouth                       $ 1.0 billion     GTE                               860 million     Nynex                             800 million     Bell Atlantic                     750 million     Donnelley                         765 million     Ameritech                         750 million     Pacific Telesis                   750 million     Southwestern Bell                 733 million     U S West                          672 million     United Telecom                    158 million</TEXT></DOC>
