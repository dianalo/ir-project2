Exact terms weren't disclosed.    The contract is the first to result from MCI's recently formed cooperative marketing agreement with International Business Machines Corp. It is also another step toward MCI's goal of luring large corporate customers.    Under terms of the multiyear agreement, MCI will transmit all of United Airlines' internal voice traffic through MCI's Vnet private network service. IBM will provide the services of its Netview PC, which will allow United, a unit of Chicago-based Allegis Corp., to use a single management system to monitor telephone and computer systems.    A spokeswoman for United said price was the reason the airline chose MCI. Other bidders included American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and U.S. Sprint Communications Co., a joint venture of United Telecommunications Inc. and GTE Corp. United's previous phone system was a hybrid of ATandamp;T and MCI.    As previously reported, MCI expects large corporate accounts by 1990 to generate 50% of revenue. Currently, the accounts generate 15% to 20% of revenue. </TEXT></DOC>
