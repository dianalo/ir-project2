The court ruled that a plaintiff must be allowed to provethat companies not directly responsible for a particularaccident nonetheless helped create the safety hazard byfighting government regulations or conspiring to minimizepublic awareness of the dangers. If the plaintiff can provesuch a role, any company that manufactured an identicalproduct could be compelled to pay a share of damages in suitsresulting from product defects.</LP><TEXT>   Defense lawyers said the decision, which appears to be thefirst of its kind nationally, expands the boundaries ofcorporate liability and could have broad implications formakers of tobacco, asbestos and other products about whichsafety or health concerns have been raised.   However, because the ruling is a single decision by anintermediate state appeals court, its long-term effect isuncertain. The ruling is binding only in New York, and eventhere it still must survive a likely appeal to the state'shighest court, the New York Court of Appeals.   The case involves a wrongful-death action brought byFrancene Rastelli, the fiancee of a man who was killed wheninflating a tire on a dump truck; the truck's multipiece tirerim exploded, striking him on the head.   Ms. Rastelli filed the suit against Goodyear Tire andamp; RubberCo., Firestone Tire andamp; Rubber Co., Budd Co., and Kelsey-HayesCo., which make almost all the multipiece tire rims in theU.S.; Goodyear and Budd asked the court to dismiss the caseagainst them, arguing the evidence conclusively demonstratedthat their products had not been involved in the fatalaccident.   While agreeing that Goodyear and Budd weren't themanufacturers, the court nevertheless kept them in the case.The court ruled that the plaintiffs could introduce evidencethat the companies acted in concert through &quot;an expressagreement or tacit understanding&quot; to prevent public awarenessof the alleged propensity of multipiece tire rims to explodeand to block governmental action that would have required themanufacturers to recall the products.   All the companies that make the rims have repeatedly saidthat the product is safe when used properly. Joseph Farrell,a New York lawyer for Budd, said the case &quot;opens a terriblePandora's box.&quot; He said that Ms. Rastelli's claim that aconspiracy exists among tire-rim manufacturers is unfounded.A lawyer for Goodyear said he couldn't comment because thecase is pending but that the company is seeking to appeal thedecision.   &quot;What's next? The decision means Ford could be liable fora Toyota accident. It creates liability out of meremembership in an industry,&quot; says Jay P. Mayesh, a New Yorkproduct liability defense lawyer not involved in the case.   In recent years, a number of courts have imposedcollective liability on manufacturers when plaintiffs havebeen unable to identify which company sold the particularproduct that injured them. In cases involving the pregnancydrug DES, several courts have held all DES manufacturersliable for alleged injuries, based on their share of thenational market. But the Rastelli case goes a step furtherbecause the plaintiff knows which companies weren't involvedin manufacturing the allegedly defective tire rim.   ---   PUNITIVE DAMAGES against airlines in international travelare barred by court.   Resolving a dispute between two U.S. district courts, thefederal appeals court in Manhattan said that a 1929 treaty onair travel prohibits airlines from being sued for punitivedamages, even in cases of alleged wrongdoing.   The decision by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appealsupholds a lower-court ruling that Pan Am Corp. can't be suedfor punitive damages for alleged security lapses in the 1988terrorist bombing of Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. Atthe same time, the appeals-court panel reversed a decisionallowing such damages in a case involving the 1986 hijackingof a Pan Am plane in Karachi, Pakistan.   The appeals court said allowing lawsuits for punitivedamages would defeat the purpose of the 1929 treaty, known asthe Warsaw Convention. The appeals court said &quot;clearly theoverriding purpose&quot; of the Warsaw Convention was &quot;to limitair carriers' potential liability in the event of accidents.&quot;   Punitive damages are meant primarily to deter wrongdoingand can greatly exceed any amount intended to compensatevictims for their actual losses. Because punitive damages areunpredictable and are treated differently in differentnations' courts, allowing such damages would undercut theuniformity that the treaty was meant to bring to the airlineindustry, the court said.   &quot;Interpreting the convention to allow such recovery wouldseverely hobble most of the aims the convention sought toaccomplish,&quot; the appeals court said.   Lee S. Kreindler, an attorney for the victims in the PanAm lawsuits, said the plaintiffs are studying the opinion andare likely to request a full appeals court review of thethree-judge panel's decision. If that request is denied, theplaintiffs' attorneys will ask the U.S. Supreme Court toconsider the issue.   &quot;The decision simply doesn't follow the plain and simplelanguage of the treaty,&quot; Mr. Kreindler said. The plaintiffs'attorneys argue that the treaty allows damages to bedetermined by the laws of nation where the litigation isfiled.   Under changes adopted in 1966, the treaty requiresairlines to pay no more than $75,000 in compensatory damagesfor each passenger killed or injured while traveling on aninternational flight. If willful misconduct is proved,additional compensatory damages may be sought, the appealscourt said, but punitive damages are barred.   ---   CAMPUS CRIME decision won't be appealed by SouthwestMissouri State University. University regents agreed to abideby a federal judge's March 13 ruling that university policerecords aren't covered by federal privacy statutes thatprotect other educational records. The regents also agreed topay legal costs incurred by student newspaper editor TraciBauer, who initiated the lawsuit to make public campus crimereports.</TEXT></DOC>
