The initial reserve requirements imposedunder section 19(b)(2) were set at three percent for each depository institution'stotal transaction accounts of $25 million or less and at 12 percent ontotal transaction accounts above $25 million. Section 19(b)(2) furtherprovides that, before December 31 of each year, the Board shall issue aregulation adjusting for the next calendar year the total dollar amountof the transaction account tranche against which reserves must be maintainedat a ratio of three percent. The adjustment in the tranche is to be 80percent of the percentage change in total transaction accounts for alldepository institutions determined as of June 30 of each year. Currently, the amount of the low reserve tranche on transaction accountsis $40.5 million. The growth in the total net transaction accounts of alldepository institutions from June 30, 1987, to June 30, 1988, was 3.0 percent(from $586.6 billion to $604.1 billion). In accordance with section 19(b)(2),the Board is amending Regulation D to increase the amount of the low reservetranche for transaction accounts for 1986 by $1.0 million to $41.5 million.Section 19(b)(11)(A) of the Federal Reserve Act provides that $2 millionof reservable liabilities\1\<NOTE/> of each depository institution shall be subject to a zeropercent reserve requirement. Section 19(b)(11)(A) permits each depositoryinstitution, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Board,to designate the reservable liabilities to which this reserve requirementexemption is to apply. However, if transaction accounts are designated,only those that would otherwise be subject to a three percent reserve requirement(<T3>i.e.,</T3> transaction accounts within the low reserve requirementtranche) may be so designated. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\Reservable liabilities include transaction accounts, nonpersonaltime deposits, and Eurocurrency liabilities as defined in section 19(b)(5)of the Federal Reserve Act. Section 19(b)(11)(B) of the Federal Reserve Act provides that, before December31 of each year, the Board shall issue a regulation adjusting for the nextcalendar year the dollar amount of reservable liabilities exempt from reserverequirements. The change in the amount is to be made only if the totalreservable liabilities held at all depository institutions increases fromone year to the next. The percentage increase in the exemption is to be80 percent of the percentage increase in total reservable liabilities ofall depository institutions determined as of June 30 each year. The growthin total reservable liabilities of all depository institutions from June30, 1987, to June 30, 1988, was 6.5 percent (from $1,184.6 billion to $1,261.7billion). In accordance with section 19(b)(11), the Board is amending RegulationD to increase the amount of the reserve requirement exemption from 1989by $0.2 million to $3.4 million. As a result, the effect of these amendments is to raise the low reservetranche to $41.5 million and to apply a zero percent reserve requirementon the first $3.4 million of transaction accounts and a three percent reserverequirement on the remainder of the low reserve tranche. Any amount ofthis zero percent reserve requirement tranche remaining after applyingit to transaction accounts will then be applied to nonpersonal time depositswith maturities of less than 1\1/2\ years or to Eurocurrency liabilities,both of which are subject to a reserve requirement ratio of three percent.The tranche adjustment and the reservable liabilities exemption adjustmentfor weekly reporting institutions will be effective starting with the reservecomputation period beginning on Tuesday, December 27, 1988, and with thecorresponding reserve maintenance periods beginning Thursday, December29, 1988, for net transaction accounts, and on Thursday, January 26, 1989,for other reservable liabilities. For institutions that report quarterly,the tranche adjustment and the exemption will be effective with the computationperiod beginning on Tuesday, December 20, 1988, and with the reserve maintenanceperiod beginning Thursday, January 19, 1989. In addition, all entitiescurrently submitting Form FR 2900 will continue to submit reports to theFederal Reserve under current reporting procedures. In order to reduce the reporting burden for small institutions, the Boardin 1981 established a deposit reporting cutoff level of $25 million todetermine deposit reporting frequency. Institutions are screened duringthe second quarter of each year to determine reporting frequency beginningthe following September. In March of 1985, the Board decided to index thisreporting cutoff level equal to 80 percent of the annual rate of increaseof total deposits.\2\<NOTE/> In July of 1988, in conjunction with approval of the extensionof the deposit reporting system, the Board increased the cutoff to $40million, effective in September 1988, from the $30 million cutoff thatwould have become effective in September 1988. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ In November of 1985, the Board amended the definitionof ``total deposits'' as used in determining the cutoff level to includenot only gross transaction deposits, savings accounts, and time depositsbut also reservable obligations of affiliates, ineligible acceptance liabilities,and net Eurocurrency liabilities. From June 30, 1987, to June 30, 1988, total deposits grew 6.5 percent,from $3,296.9 billion to $3,511.4 billion. This results in an increaseof $2.1 million in the deposit cutoff level which determines frequencyof reporting from the current $40.0 million to $42.1 million. Based onthe indexation of the reserve requirement exemption, the cutoff level fortotal deposits above which reports of deposits must be filed rises $0.2million to $3.4 million. Institutions with total deposits below $3.4 millionare excused from reporting if their deposits can be estimated from othersources. The $42.1 million cutoff level for weekly versus quarterly FR2900 reporting and for quarterly FR 2910q versus annual FR 2910a reporting,and the $3.4 million level threshold for reporting will be used in thesecond quarter 1989 deposits report screening process, and the adjustmentswill be made when the new deposit reporting panels are implemented in September1989. All U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks and all Edge and AgreementCorporations, regardless of size, and all other institutions with reservableliabilities in excess of the exemption level amount prescribed by section19(b)(11) of the Federal Reserve Act (known as ``nonexempt institutions'')and with total deposits at least equal to the deposit cutoff level arerequired to file weekly the Report of Transaction Accounts, Other Depositsand Vault Cash (FR 2900). Depository institutions with reservable liabilitiesin excess of the exemption level amount but with total deposits less thanthe deposit cutoff level may file the FR 2900 quarterly effective eachSeptember. Institutions that obtain funds from non-U.S. sources or thathave foreign branches or international banking facilities are requiredto file the Report of Certain Eurocurrency Transactions (FR 2950/2951)on the same frequency as they file the FR 2900. The deposit cutoff is alsoused to determine whether an institution with reservable liabilities ator below the exemption level amount (known as an ``exempt institution'')must file one of two reduced deposits reports_the Quarterly Report of SelectedDeposits, Vault Cash, and Reservable Liabilities (FR 2910q) or the AnnualReport of Total Deposits and Reservable Liabilities (FR 2910a). Exemptinstitutions (that is, institutions with total deposits less than the exemptionamount) are not required to file a deposits report if their deposits canbe estimated from other sources. Finally, the Board may require a depository institution to report on aweekly basis, regardless of the cutoff level, if the institution manipulatesits total deposits and other reservable liabilities in order to qualifyfor quarterly reporting. Similarly, any depository institution that reportsquarterly may be required to report weekly and to maintain appropriatereserve balances with its Reserve Bank if, during its computation period,it understates its usual reservable liabilities or it overstates the deductionsallowed in computing required reserve balances. <ITAG tagnum="84">Notice and Public Participation </ITAG>The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(b) relating to notice and public participationhave not been followed in connection with the adoption of these amendmentsbecause the amendments involve adjustments prescribed by statute and aninterpretative statement reaffirming the Board's policy concerning reportingpractices. The amendments also reduce regulatory burdens on depositoryinstitutions. Accordingly, the Board believes that notice and public participationis unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis </ITAG>Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. No.96-354, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Board certifies that the proposed amendments willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. The proposed amendments reduce certain regulatory burdens forall depository institutions, reduce certain burdens for small depositoryinstitutions, and have no particular effect on other small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 204 </ITAG>Banks, banking, Currency, Federal Reserve System, Penalties and reportingrequirements.
