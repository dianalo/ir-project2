Also Saturday, a German newspaper reported that a West Germanman who disappeared in Lebanon on May 4 had signed a letter sayinghe was abducted in connection with the case of TWA hijackerMohammed Ali Hamadi.   There has been no claim of responsibility for the West German,Markus Quint. The Bild am Sonntag newspaper said West Germansecurity officials believe Quint was kidnapped by Hamadi associates.   A Foreign Ministry official in Bonn said ``it would not be inthe interest of solving the case'' to comment on the newspaperreport.   The missing Briton is 83-year-old Jack Mann, who disappeared inBeirut on Friday.   A previously unheard of group, The Cells of Armed Struggle, senta statement to a Western news agency a few hours after Mann waslast seen, claiming responsibility for an abduction but notidentifying the victim.   In its Arabic statement, the group said: ``We declare ourreadiness to immediately release the captive if the Britishgovernment announces the beginning of a fair trial for our comrades.   ``We ask the British government to release our comrades detainedwithout evidence on charge of assassinating comrade Naji Al-Ali.''   The Palestinian political cartoonist died Aug. 30, 1987, afterbeing shot outside the London offices of the Kuwaiti newspaperAl-Qabas.   The Cells of Armed Struggle claimed he ``died at the hands ofthe (Israeli secret service) Mossad in cooperation with the Britishintelligence to drive a wedge and deepen differences withinPalestinian ranks.''   In London, Scotland Yard said no one has ever been arrested orcharged for the cartoonist's death and the murder remains unsolved.The British Foreign Office said the Arabic statement is ``the onlyindication we have so far that Mann may have been kidnapped.''   Britain warned all its nationals out of Beirut after a string ofkidnappings, but the Manns said in a recent interview that after 40years in the city they were too old to move and of little value ashostages.   Police said Mann was an air force pilot during World War II andthen worked as a pilot for Middle East Airlines, Lebanon's nationalcarrier. He also worked as a bartender at west Beirut's PickwickPub after retiring from the airline, they said.   Not counting Mann and Quint, there are 15 foreigners heldhostage in Lebanon, including nine Americans. The hostage heldlongest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press. He was seized March 16, 1985.   Mann's wife, Sunny Mann, said her husband left their apartmentin the seaside Raouche area at 11 a.m. Friday to go to the BritishBank of the Middle East, a little over a mile away.   An employee at the British Bank of the Middle East said Mann didnot enter the bank Friday.   Sue Tucknott, vice consul at the British Embassy in east Beirut,said the embassy had no information other than Mrs. Mann's reportthat her husband had disappeared.   Quint disappeared May 4 along with two other West German reliefworkers in south Lebanon. The other two reappeared safely.   Palestinian guerrilla leaders said unidentified kidnappers wereholding Quint in connection with the Hamadi case.   Bild am Sonntag said the West German embassy in Lebanon receiveda letter written in English and signed by Quint. It said a secondletter not signed by Quint was sent to West German Foreign MinisterHans-Dietrich Genscher.   ``In both letters it is indicated that the kidnapping isconnected to the trial of Hamadi,'' it said. ``The kidnappers aredemanding a mild sentence for Hamadi.''   Hamadi faces life in prison if convicted of murder and airpiracy in the June 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner and the slayingof an American sailor on board. He confessed to the hijacking butdenies taking part in the murder.   He is on trial in Frankfurt, West Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
