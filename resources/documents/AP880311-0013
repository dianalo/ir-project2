This iswhat commentators abroad had to say about Jackson and Bush:</TEXT><HEAD>JESSE JACKSON:</HEAD><HEAD>Switzerland</HEAD><TEXT>   _Basler Zeitung of Basel (independent): ``There is only onecharismatic personality among the candidates and his triumph willresound longest after this Super Tuesday: Jesse Jackson has pushedopen doors in the `Deep South' that can never be closed again. Evenif _ as is expected _ he will be neither nominated nor become acandidate for vice president, he has changed fundamentally thepolitical world for America's blacks.''</TEXT><HEAD>Mainland China</HEAD><TEXT>   _XINHUA News Agency (government): ``Jackson, the only blackcandidate, has the least campaign funds. His influence, however,has increased greatly compared with his campaign in 1984, when hewon only one state in the South. This time he got five Southernstates on Tuesday. ... It is obvious that the American people arenot as open-minded as to select a black to be their president. Itis also impossible for the Democratic Party to nominate a black asits candidate for the presidency.''</TEXT><HEAD>Britain</HEAD><TEXT>   _The Independent of London (independent): ``The rejection of theRev. Pat Robertson as a serious presidential candidate in Tuesday'sRepublican primaries was cheering news, while the relative successof the Rev. Jesse Jackson in the Democratic race engenders a moreambiguous mood. Neither man's foreign policy inspires confidence.But their styles, in a campaign which is being fought almostentirely on domestic issues, are very different. Mr. Robertsonlooks inward while Mr. Jackson, for all his faults, reaches out. ... Mr. Jackson ... is a serious figure in a way that Mr. Robertsonis not.''   _The Financial Times of London (independent): The ...assumption, on the Democratic side, is that the Rev. Jesse Jacksonremains a containable political force. ... In policy terms, Mr.Jackson is of the left of the Democratic Party, and on SuperTuesday better aggregate, if not individual, results were achievedby Gov. Michael Dukakis and Sen. Albert Gore, very much men of themiddle.''</TEXT><HEAD>GEORGE BUSH:</HEAD><HEAD>Denmark</HEAD><TEXT>   _Politiken of Copenhagen (liberal): ``Like a second Muhammad Alibefore a title fight the otherwise colorless George Bush hasdeclared himself as the next President of the United States. ... Heis a conservative pragmatist _ some would say, an opportunist _without strong views.   ``As far as foreign policy goes he is clearly the mostexperienced of all the candidates. If he becomes president, one canexpect a continuation of recent years' improvement inAmerican-Soviet relations as well as foreign trade policies of amore liberal sort that certain young turks among the Democrats haveavowed.''</TEXT><HEAD>Britain</HEAD><TEXT>   _The Guardian (liberal): ``Bush ... has the money and themachine to cover the country. In some parts of America _ like theSouth _ they like the continuity with Ronald Reagan that the vicepresident seems to offer. Better the devil you've seen around alot. ... But no one, examining the attitude and exit polls from theSouth, should too blithely assume that old George has roses all theway to next November's real vote. He still isn't seen as much of aleader by four-fifths of those who chose him. His views areregarded as fuzzy; his trustiness is much in question.''   _The Daily Telegraph of London (conservative): ``At this earlystage in the process by which America selects a president, VicePresident George Bush looks the most likely Republican contender. ... The prospect of Mr. Bush securing the final nomination is heldin some quarters to be good news for the Democrats; he carrieshandicaps as well as the aura of the vice presidency.</TEXT><HEAD>Switzerland</HEAD><TEXT>   _Der Bund of Bern (right of center): ``Bush takes the floor asthe administrator of the estate left by Reagan whose economicpolicy appears to be successful to many Americans despite theenormous increase of the debt burden. The whole thing recalls thewell-orchestrated campaign by Mondale in 1984 who won thenomination without new ideas, without emotional appeal to thevoters, only to be badly beaten by Reagan.''</TEXT><TEXT>   _La Suisse of Geneva (independent): ``From now on, thepossibility of George Bush becoming president must be regarded as aserious possibility. Against a Democratic Party from which genuinecontenders _ if there are any _ have not yet emerged, the raceseems almost easy for the vice president. The `Super Tuesday'mountain has given birth to a mouse, and that one is feared to berather mousy.''</TEXT></DOC>
