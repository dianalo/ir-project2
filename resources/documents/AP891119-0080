The report said the People's Bank of China and the Industrialand Commercial Bank have provided large loans to enable thegovernment to buy stockpiled Volkswagens, Chrysler Corp. Jeeps andPeugeots produced in China.   The loans to rescue the high-profile joint ventures are thelatest crack in the government's year-old austerity program, whichwas designed to cool off the overheated economy by sharply reducingcredit and slashing public spending.   With industrial output value falling in October in the firstdecline in a decade and fears of a recession growing, thegovernment has begun to pour huge amounts of money into failingstate enterprises. It also has had to provide large loans to localbanks lacking funds to pay for this year's grain harvest.   The daily, quoting Xu Bingjin, an official in charge of autoventures in the State Planning Commission, said so far thegovernment had bought 1,500 Santanas produced in Volkswagen'sShanghai plant, 500 Jeep Cherokees from the Beijing Jeep Corp and800 Peugeots from the French company's joint venture in Canton.   The government said it will later sell the cars to domesticbuyers, mainly public offices, deemed to be in urgent need ofvehicles.   The Santana, Jeep and Peugeot models, together with VolkswagenAudis produced in the northeastern city of Changchun, are the onlypassenger vehicles made in China.   All have been hit by the austerity program that has imposedstiff luxury taxes on vehicles, banned most public institutes frombuying new cars and made it more difficult to import parts neededfor assembly plants.   Volkswagen, which will produce about 15,000 Santanas this year,almost all for the domestic Chinese market, reportedly has astockpile of 3,000 vehicles and is operating at only 50 percentcapacity.   The government apparently is helping the automakers out ofconcern that their troubles would add to the negative image ofChina's investment climate, which has suffered since the bloodymilitary suppression of pro-democracy dissent in June.   Xu said the government loosened controls on car consumption lastmonth to ease the burden on the joint ventures.   ``China's tight budget and control of luxury consumption doesnot mean (China will) close its door to the outside world,'' hesaid, adding that China wants ``to create a better environment forforeign investors.''   The government in 1986 came to the rescue of Beijing Jeep, thena partnership that included the former American Motors Corp., afterthe celebrated Sino-U.S. joint venture was forced to shut downbecause it lacked the foreign currency to import needed parts.   Xu also criticized the French government for withholding loansfor a new joint venture agreed upon in August between the No. 2Automobile Factory in Hubei province and France's Citroen.   France's failure to provide the loan has brought heavy losses toChina, Xu said.   ``If the French government continues to delay the loan, we wouldnot rule out the possibility of looking for new foreign partnersfor the joint venture,'' he said.   The project, which calls for initial production of 150,000 carsand 200,000 engines annually when the plant opens in 1993, was tobe financed with $1.1 billion and would be China's biggest projectever in its mechanical industry.</TEXT></DOC>
