Kodak has turned over to state environmental authorities data covering nine sites where there are suspected chemical leaks or spills. In one instance, the company believes ground water under a nearby residential street has been contaminated with methylene chloride, a suspected cancer-causing chemical used to make film.    State and federal environmental agencies, assisted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, are trying to determine whether the company knowingly contaminated ground water and willfully disregarded reporting requirements. State officials have said the company failed to promptly report discovery of the contaminants at several sites, while Kodak maintains that it wasn't legally required to report the situation sooner.    &quot;We're in the very preliminary stages (of an investigation),&quot; said Dale Anderson, supervisor of the FBI's Rochester office. &quot;It's not real clear what we have.&quot; Kodak said it isn't aware of any criminal investigations.    A panel, comprising local and state authorities, residents and company representatives, is working on a plan to determine any long-term health and environmental risks. Kodak will pay for the testing and health survey.    &quot;We know of no immediate health problems, but there's an awful lot that still needs to be looked at,&quot; said Thomas R. Frey, Monroe County executive.    The contamination issue has triggered a community relations headache for community-minded Kodak. Residents, including a group known as Concerned Neighbors of Kodak Park, have held two heated public meetings. And a banner headline in the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, which disclosed the contamination, urged Kodak to &quot;Come Clean.&quot;    Kodak spokesman Ronald Roberts contended that the company has long enjoyed a reputation as a good corporate citizen and has been on the forefront of health, safety and environmental issues. &quot;This situation has brought that reputation into question and we don't like that very much,&quot; he said. &quot;We're trying to do what's right.&quot;    The company agreed to an undisclosed financial settlement with two homeowners who found that because of the publicity, they could neither rent nor lease their homes, which are located on a street bordering the plant. Kodak even offered free car wash coupons to nearby residents after recent heavy emissions of fly ash from a Kodak smokestack.    The publicity also has placed Kodak under greater scrutiny by environmental officials. In one case, state officials discovered employees dumping sludge, which contained hazardous wastes, into a hole. Kodak said it would properly dispose of the material. </TEXT></DOC>
