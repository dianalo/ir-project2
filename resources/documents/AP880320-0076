West Germany's three other major parties also sufferedpercentage losses in the state balloting. Two small right-wingparties scored surprising gains, apparently getting votes fromdissatisfied farmers.   Three hours after the polls closed at 6 p.m., computerprojections by the national television networks gave the ChristianDemocrats about 49 percent of the vote.   They dropped under the 50-percent mark for the first time in 16years, but the party will maintain its absolute control of thestate legislature.   Its main opposition, the Social Democrats, had 32 percent, downfrom 32.4 percent in 1984.   The environmentalist Greens received 7.9 percent, just under the8 percent four years ago, while the Free Democrats who had hoped toforce the CDU into a coalition suffered a blow, getting 6 percentcompared to 7.2 percent in 1984.   Two far-right parties acted as spoilers, but neither won enoughvotes to gain any seats in the legislature. the National DemocraticParty of Germany had about 2 percent and the Republicans 1 percent.   Several smaller parties shared the remaining vote.   According to Baden-Wuerttemberg's complicated election laws, thenumber of seats in the state parliament can vary, and the newlegislature was expected to have 125 seats, one less than theprevious one.   Led by Lothar Spaeth, the governor for 10 years, the ChristianDemocrats were expected to win at least 66 seats, compared to 68 inthe previous legislature.   Social Democrats had 42, a gain of one, and the Greens alsogained one for a total of 10.   The Free Democrats lost a seat and will have seven.   Spaeth, 50, campaigned on Baden-Wuerttemberg's strong economicperformance, and Kohl said the results were a ``great personalvictory'' for the governor.   At 5 percent, the state has the lowest unemployment rate in thecountry, about four points under the national average.   Spaeth has transformed the southwestern state from apredominantly rural area into a major base for the growingelectronics and high-technology industries.   The result was a welcome relief for Kohl's party, which had beenslipping since the national election in January 1987.   The Christian Democrats lost their majority in Kohl's home stateof Rhineland-Palatinate last May, and were forced into a coalitionwith the Free Democrats. The Christian Democrats and Free Democratsalso are governing coalition partners in the federal government andin six of West Germany's 11 states.   Kohl, speaking on national television, said the two smallright-wing parties apparently picked up votes from farmers who areunhappy with Spaeth's policies and want more aid.   ``I don't see a radical trend,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
