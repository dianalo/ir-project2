Now, she is going on trial, charged with killing 17patients in a two-year period.   Michaela Roeder admits giving the fatal doses to six of thepatients, and says she did it to spare them pain. But prosecutorKarl Hermann Majorowsky alleges she did it just as a ``demonstrationof her power.''   ``The accused posed as a mistress over life and death. We aredealing here with cold-blooded murder out of base motives,'' a Jan.9 issue of Der Spiegel magazine quoted Majorowsky as saying.   Ms. Roeder's murder trial begins Tuesday in district court inWuppertal, about 37 miles north of Bonn. She faces a possiblesentence of life in prison if convicted.   The accusations against Ms. Roeder, 30, have absorbed the WestGerman press, who have called the alleged killings ``nearly theperfect murder'' because they went almost unnoticed by police.   On a tip from a hospital employee, authorities had the bodies of28 deceased former patients of the intensive care unit at St. PetrusHospital in Wuppertal exhumed.   According to court records, the examinations showed that 17 ofthe patients had received a ``fatal dose'' of drugs that canseverely affect blood pressure or the heart.   Ms. Roeder is accused of issuing the fatal injections betweenFebruary 1984 and February 1986 while working in the St. Petrusintensive care section.   After Ms. Roeder's arrest in March 1986, she admitted to lawofficials that she gave fatal injections to six patients because shewanted to spare them suffering from their ailments. Majorowsky saysin court papers there are ``no clues that these patients would havedied.''   Most of the 17 patients were elderly and had been brought to theintensive care section after operations for ailments ranging fromappendicitis to cancer, according to news reports. The oldest victimwas 94, according to the reports.   The official cause of death for the 17 patients was heart orcirculatory failure, the reports said.   Ms. Roeder began working at the hospital in 1978 and was jokinglydubbed the ``Angel of Death'' by her colleagues when elderlypatients under her care started dying, according to Der Spiegel.   ``They didn't call Michaela Roeder the `Angel of Death' becausethey suspected foul play,'' the magazine wrote. ``The little joke inthis name was meant to help console her over her bad luck and theseunfortunate coincidences.''   The magazine said Majorowsky is expected to have difficultyproving murder against Ms. Roeder.   ``The weak point of the charge is the motive brought against thedefendant. Killing in order to demonstrate power, to feel that shewas a mistress over life or death?,'' the magazine askedrhetorically.   Der Spiegel said the trial will likely investigate whether Ms.Roeder may have been unable to withstand the stress and demands ofworking in an intensive care unit. More than 40 witnesses andmedical experts are expected to testify.   If there is insufficient evidence for premeditated murder, Ms.Roeder could be found guilty of manslaughter, which carries aminimum sentence of five years in prison.</TEXT></DOC>
