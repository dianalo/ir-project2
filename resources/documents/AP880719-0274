The tentative deal announced Monday carries high risks as wellas potential gains for United Telecommunications Inc., the phonecompany that is raising its stake in US Sprint to 80.1 percent from50 percent.   GTE's share will fall to 19.9 percent at the beginning of 1989,assuming completion of the deal.   In a related announcement, Robert H. Snedaker, US Sprint's62-year-old president, said he would take early retirementeffective Aug. 15.   Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., which rates the security of companydebt, announced late Monday it was considering a downgrade ofUnited Telecommunications' debt and an upgrade of GTE's debt.   United Telecommunications, based in Kansas City, is one-fifththe size of Stamford, Conn.-based GTE and is losing money becauseof the red ink at US Sprint.   US Sprint lost $138 million in the first quarter of 1988 afterracking up losses of $800 million last year. The two parents haveshared those losses equally.   In addition to the huge costs of building a nationwide fiberoptic network, US Sprint has a history of billing problems thathave cut into revenue. It says the billing problems are largelybehind it.   Financial analysts say United Telecommunications' management hasstaked the future of the company on the success of US Sprint, whichis third in the long-distance market behind American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. and MCI Communications Corp.   ATandamp;T leads with about 72 to 73 percent of the long-distancemarket, MCI is second with about 10 percent and US Sprint ranksthird with about 7 percent, according to Jack Grubman, an analystfor PaineWebber Inc.   Charles Schelke, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.,said he believes US Sprint has turned a corner towardprofitability, so United Telecommunications' increased ownership is``a pretty good deal.''   But he said, ``It depends on your view of US Sprint's future.''   ``Obviously we believe that the opportunities far exceed therisk,'' United Telecommunications spokesman Don Forsythe said.   United Telecommunications stock closed unchanged at $33.62{ ashare, while GTE's fell 37{ cents a share to $40 in consolidatedNew York Stock Exchange trading Monday.   In a joint statement, GTE and United Telecommunications said:``Both partners came to the conclusion that the 50-50 managementarrangement inherent in the present partnership agreement, althoughimportant initially in launching US Sprint successfully, has becomean unnecessary burden given the dynamics of US Sprint's fast growthand the rapidly changing environment of the long-distanceindustry.''   GTE and United Telecommunications formed US Sprint in July 1986as a joint venture consisting of GTE's Sprint, UnitedTelecommunication's own US Telecom, and some smaller operations.   Their projections of profitability for the company provedpremature. Last summer Charles Skibo resigned as president as thecompany announced a $350 million pre-tax charge againstsecond-quarter earnings.   Snedaker, who was named to succeed him, had been vice presidentand chief operating officer of United Telecommunications.   William T. Esrey, the president and chief executive of UnitedTelecommunications, will fill Snedaker's job on an interim basis.Before the end of the year, United Telecommunication will take overday-to-day management of US Sprint.   Esrey issued a statement praising Snedaker, that said: ``We owehim a great debt of gratitude for putting US Sprint's operationsback on track.''   Even before its latest move, United Telecommunications had goneto great lengths to support US Sprint. In May it announced it wasselling its cellular phone operations to Centel Corp. for $772million, partly to raise cash for US Sprint.   The estimated $600 million purchase price for the 30.1 percentstake in US Sprint is based on estimates of the book value of thepartnership interest at the end of 1988.   Under the deal, United Telecommunications would have the option,until Dec. 31, 1995, to buy GTE's remaining 19.9 percent interestin US Sprint at book value of Dec. 31, 1988, or at book value atthe time of the transaction, whichever is higher.   Otherwise, GTE would have the option of requiring UnitedTelecommunications to buy its remaining interest at any timebetween Dec. 31, 1991, and Dec. 31, 1995, at the book valueprevailing at the time of the transaction.   United Telecommunications provides local phone service, mainlyin the Southeast and Midwest. It lost $51.5 million on revenue of$2.98 billion in 1987.   GTE also gets most of its revenue from local phone service,although it also has data communications, Sylvania light bulbs,specialty manufacturing and consumer communications products. Itearned $1.12 billion on revenue of $15.4 billion last year.</TEXT></DOC>
