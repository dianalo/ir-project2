The black community has had to survive on self-help because our political, economic, social and religious leaders failed to protect black rights and promote opportunities. It was because the NAACP, and other black institutions, had to devote so much time to helping the community gain the rights and opportunities that others gain simply by being Americans that it was difficult to give enough time and energy to social problems. More important, the NAACP or other groups will never be able to address serious social problems without our institutions' support.    It appears to me that you are trying to deny societal responsibility for helping to address the problems created by public policies and practices, and placing the burden on blacks. The conservative white establishment has used the voices of the black neoconservatives (and they lend themselves to the cause) to blame blacks and at the same time avoid charges of racism. You never point out that 95% of the best-educated, most thoughtful blacks in the country -- and many whites -- disagree with the viewpoint of the several black neoconservatives you constantly cite.    What you are doing not only hurts blacks, but also hurts America. Blacks are to America what 15% of the fibers of the heart are to the total organ. And just as when enough fibers are damaged, the organ will be destroyed and the body will die, when too many blacks are not able to function well, the society will be weakened and will go into decline.
