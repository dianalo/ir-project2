Then there was Boesky. ThenDrexel Burnham Lambert.   The three blockbuster fraud cases epitomized the success of theSecurities and Exchange Commission in exposing financial skulduggeryand toughening securities law enforcement standards in the 1980s.   Now, with the federal agency's enforcement chief, chairman andseveral other top officials stepping down, what can the SEC do foran encore?   ``I think what we have seen is some very good cops and robberswork,'' said SEC commissioner Joseph Grundfest, who has announcedhe's leaving in mid-1990 to teach at Stanford University. ``Thedivision has scored bull's eyes with big cases.''   The direct hits constituted a domino effect that thrust the55-year-old federal agency charged with policing the nation'sfinancial markets into the spotlight during a wildly prosperousdecade whose handmaiden was scandal.   A tip about suspicious trading practices at a Bahamian bankeventually led to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. investment bankerDennis Levine, who in 1986 agreed to relinquish $12.6 million ininsider trading profits and penalties.   Levine cooperated with the government and ratted on speculatorIvan Boesky, who paid $100 million in forbidden profits andpenalties for insider trading and named names, including Drexel andits junk-bond impresario Michael Milken.   Drexel is paying $650 million in fines and restitution; Milkenhas been indicted for fraud and racketeering and could face evenbigger financial punishment.   Those cases, along with a calm response to the 1987 stock marketcrash, raised the SEC's stature and stirred calls in Congress toboost funding for an agency that raises for the Treasury nearlythree times its annual budget.   But with most of the Drexel matter resolved, SEC EnforcementDirector Gary Lynch said he is leaving in July after four years atopthe agency police squad. SEC Chairman David Ruder, a Reaganadministration appointee, is stepping down to return to teaching,which will allow President Bush to shape the agency.   Besides Grundfest, the other three commissioners are rumored onthe way out; two are serving without Senate confirmation and one,Edward H. Fleischman, is said to be considering resigning if heisn't named to succeed Ruder.   All that should point to a period of transition and uncertaintyat the Washington-based agency founded during the Depression inresponse to the Crash of 1929. But staffers and outsiders saidenforcement groundwork laid down by Lynch should ensure a smoothcontinuation.   ``The SEC really has a very strong sense of continuity,'' saidAlan Bromberg, a securities law professor at Southern MethodistUniversity. ``It's a lot like the British government. The primeminister may change but the people in the bureaucracy tend to be thesame over time.''   ``There's no need to bring in anyone to clean things up or changedirection radically,'' he said.   ``Things have continued to work pretty much as usual,'' saidWilliam McLucas, an associate enforcement director and a topcandidate for Lynch's job.   ``There is some level of anticipation about who the new chairmanwill be and who the director of the division will be,'' he said.``It's not a paralyzing kind of thing, just the kind of thing you'dnormally expect to be on people's minds.''   Aside from the new leadership, two factors could dictate whetherthe SEC remains in the spotlight. One is the direction of theeconomy, which historically influences the nature of financialcrime. The other is whether the domino effect continues and theDrexel case produces another high-profile bust.   ``A legitimate question is, what's going to be the next Drexel oris there going to be a next Drexel?'' said Barry Goldsmith, theSEC's deputy chief litigation counsel, who helped handle the Drexelcase.   ``Historically the pattern has been that each of these casesstarting with Levine has led to several others,'' he said. ``Aquestion is, is this going to end some time or is this going to keepcontinuing? I don't know, I really don't.''   The bull market of the 1980s with large numbers of mergers andacquisitions led the commission to cases in which Wall Streetersused advance information of takeover activity to illegally trade insecurities: insider trading.   But if the economy slows as many experts predict _ mergeractivity already is showing a sharp decline _ the SEC could uncovermore financial disclosure improprieties as companies try to cutcorners or tinker with statements.   ``It's human nature not to want to disclose the bad news unlessone's forced to,'' said John Sturc, an associate enforcementdirector who also is in the running for the top job. ``We had a lotof financial disclosure cases arising out of the '81-'82 recession.''   The SEC already is devoting more resources to fraud in cheap,over-the-counter securities known as penny stocks. Experts alsopredict more cases involving overseas transactions, a reflection ofthe enforcement division's liaisons with foreign governmentcounterparts.   SEC staffers said the agency's general enforcement philosophychanged in the early 1980s to concentrate more on the market processand financial reporting and less on tangential legal issues.   Along with that came a more militant stance on sanctions,including stiffer penalties in all cases and tough complianceprovisions, such as oversight powers against Drexel.   There also has been more cooperation with the Justice Departmentin filing related criminal cases, such as with Milken and Drexel.   ``My impression is that the commission in general felt a need formore significant sanctions against people who violate the law in thecivil context,'' said Sturc, 39, who has worked in the enforcementdivision seven years.   The SEC isn't without problems. Staffing has increased by just 4percent in the 1980s to around 2,130, while the commission'sresponsibilities, workload and enforcement actions have soared.   Sales on the nation's securities exchanges have risen to $2.1trillion from about $540 billion in 1980. The number of brokeragefirms jumped to 11,900 from 6,750 and of brokers and dealers to480,000 from 196,000 in the same period.   The SEC collected $252 million in filing fees in fiscal 1988, upmore than four times from 1980, but its budget, at $143 million,hasn't even doubled. The SEC is seeking $168.7 million for fiscal1990, and has support from many congressmen who have sermonizedabout financial irregularity.   The commission also is seeking to boost salaries for its 800staff attorneys, partly to halt a high turnover rate. First-year SEClawyers make $27,172, a third or quarter of what top law firms offer.   ``It's a chronic problem but it's become dramatically acute,''said Lawrence Iason, regional director of the SEC's New York office,where staffing has been cut from from about 240 to 200 in recentyears. ``There are greater demands on our resources and we havefewer resources.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday, June 11</NOTE></DOC>
