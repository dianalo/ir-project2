The agreement ended a two-month strike at Toronto-based de Havilland by the Canadian Auto Workers union, which represents 4,100 production and office workers at the company. Workers began their strike when their contract expired June 23. During the strike, nonunion workers produced about half the number of planes the company would have normally manufactured.    As previously reported, the contract provides a lump-sum payment and hourly wage increase in the first year, with further increases in the second and third years of the pact.    De Havilland workers are expected to begin returning to their jobs Sept. 8, the union said. De Havilland was acquired by Seattle-based Boeing, an aircraft manufacturer, in January 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
