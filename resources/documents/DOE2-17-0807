A furtherinvestigation of the potential of this technique was carried out witha chemical kinetic model involving homogeneous gas phase reactions. Themodelled optimal conditions indicated that for NH{sub 3}/NO 1.5, H{sub2}O{sub 2}/NO 0.7, a flue gas temperature of 690-710 degrees C at theentrance of the channel, with the combustor being fired at an air factorof 1.2-1.3 ca. 70% NO/sub x/ reduction can be achieved without high levelsof residual NH{sub 3}. 40 refs., 7 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
