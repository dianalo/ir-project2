The capacitive operation or cycling of driverless systems requirethe use of different battery systems. Energy supply concepts have tobe based on the perspective functional descriptions. The required datacomprise full details on discharging processes (temporal current flows),intermediate and complete charging, ambient temperature ranges (whichdetermine the type of battery to be used), and the minimum dischargevoltage. Data on the exchange of batteries as well as on the maximumweight and volume of batteries complete the list of data. Any systemsevaluation of the batteries to be used has to take account of the operatingconditions.</TEXT></DOC>
