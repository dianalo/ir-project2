TaylorStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)REAL ESTATE, REITS, LAND DEVELOPMENT (REL)FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. withdrew a three-year-old proposal to limit real estate development investments by state-chartered banks, but another federal proposal on the subject is still pending.    Currently, 23 states allow banks to invest in real estate development, subject to varying restrictions. The FDIC action lifts one threat of federal regulation over such investments; the Federal Reserve Board is still considering a rule.    John Rousselot, president of the National Council of Savings Institutions, called the FDIC action a &quot;victory&quot; for state banks. But other bank industry lobbyists worried that inaction by the FDIC may make the Fed more likely to impose restrictions.    The FDIC had proposed to limit individual real estate investments to 10% of a bank's capital, and all real estate investment by a bank to 50% of capital. Yesterday, the FDIC board ordered its staff to draft, within 45 days, a much more limited proposal to curb investment only in real estate in which bank stockholders or officers have an interest.    Robert Miailovich, associate director of the FDIC's bank supervision planning and development division, said the agency's staff didn't find evidence of widespread abuse of banks' authority to invest directly in real estate. He said the FDIC also couldn't agree with the Fed staff on a common proposal.    The Fed has proposed a more restrictive cap, limiting a bank holding company's total real estate investment, including both equity and loans, to 25% of its capital or $250,000, whichever is larger. </TEXT></DOC>
