The executions continued despite mounting internationalcondemnation of the government's crackdown on internal dissent.   The seven put to death by the state had been convicted of burningmilitary vehicles when the army marched into Beijing on June 3-4 anddrove thousands of demonstrators out of Tiananmen Square.   A poster board outside the Beijing high court was filled withsmall arrest notices, and those involving the condemned said theyranged in age from 18 to 33. There was a large red check, indicatingexecution, on each of the notices with the word ``proclaimed.''Soldiers later tore the notices off the board.   So far, 27 people have been put to death: the seven in Beijing,and on Wednesday three in Shanghai and 17 in Jinan.   The Shanghai residents were condemned of leading an angry mobthat burned a train on June 6 after it smashed through a barricadeset up by protesters, killing six people.   The 17 in the northeastern city of Jinan were among 45 peopleconvicted at a public rally of 10,000 of ``seriously endangeringpublic order.'' A local reporter said they were common criminals notassociated with the student movement, but a radio broadcast saidthey had taken part in disturbances in Shandong province.   Jinan, like many other Chinese cities, was rocked bydemonstrations and riots after the military crackdown ended sevenweeks of protests in Beijing.   Police since have arrested more than 1,600 nationwide forparticipating in what the government calls the``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''   Many nations, including the United States, appealed to China forclemency for the condemned, and denounced the executions when thegovernment carried them out.   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua said Thursday it was``unwise and futile'' for other countries to try to dictate howChina should handle its domestic turmoil.   China hopes to maintain relations with the United Stats, but ``wefirmly oppose the American government interfering in China'sinternal affairs and exerting pressure on China,'' Li said at aweekly press briefing.   The Bush administration has cut off military sales and top-levelcontacts to protest China's suppression of the pro-democracymovement.   In announcing the arrests of the 13 people charged with spyingfor Taiwan, national television news showed secretly filmed scenesof the accused mixing with demonstrators and joining in chantsduring rallies in Tiananmen Square. It also showed secret codes andinvisible ink allegedly used by the men, all Chinese citizens.   China has maintained that the student protesters were manipulatedby outside forces.   News reports said the 13 were recruited by military intelligenceofficers of the Nationalist government on Taiwan, and by localagents.   China's Xinhua News Agency quoted the State Security Ministry assaying that Taiwan ordered the alleged spies to ``exploit theso-called `democratic movement,' escalate it into an overall`anti-Communist' movement and collect information for the Taiwansecret service.''   National television also gave prominent coverage to a meeting ofState Education Commission head Li Tieying and a delegation from theWorld Bank.   Li has been mentioned frequently in recent news reports,bolstering theories he is rising in China's political hierarchy andmay be headed for a position on the powerful Communist PartyPolitburo Standing Committee.   Party officials are expected to meet soon and two moderates onthe five-member committee, party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang andparty propaganda chief Hu Qili, are expected to be officially oustedfrom their posts.   Qiao Shi, the committee member responsible for security matters,is expected to succeed Zhao as party boss. Li is a candidate to fillHu's position.   The moderates reportedly were stripped of their authority afterlosing a power struggle to senior leader Deng Xiaoping, Premier LiPeng and other political hard-liners who backed the crackdown on thedemocracy movement.   Zhao has not been seen since May 19, when he met with protestingstudents in Tiananmen Square and expressed sympathy for theirdemands, including an end to official corruption and a free press.Premier Li imposed martial law on the city the next day.</TEXT></DOC>
