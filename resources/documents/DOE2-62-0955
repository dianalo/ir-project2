<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-62-0955 </DOCNO><TEXT>Lead chalcogenide diode lasers are useful for spectroscopic and fiberoptics applications in the mid-infrared (2.5-30 {mu}m) wavelength range.These devices have previously required cryogenic cooling (less than 100K) for CW operation. This limitation has been overcome through the useof a new, lattice-matched alloy system, Pb/sub 1-x/Eu/sub x/Se/sub y/Te/sub1-y/, as well as the introduction of advanced, quantum well active regiondevice structures grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Operating temperatureshave been increased to 175 K CW (at 4.4 {mu}m) and to 270 K pulsed (at3.9 {mu}m). Thermal leakage currents out of the device active regionappear to be limiting device performance. This has led to the study ofbank offsets in PbEuSeTe/PbTe heterojunctions as well as to explorationof alternative high energy band gap alloys of PbTe with Ge, Yb, Ca, Sr,and Ba. The status of this work and examples of ultra-high resolutionstudies done with these tunable laser sources are included.</TEXT></DOC>
