ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., his Super Tuesday strategya failure outside the South, was packing away his presidentialambitions Wednesday after his dismal finish in the New YorkDemocratic primary.   His campaign more than $1.5 million in debt, Gore flew to Texasfor a $1,000-per-person fund-raiser. He scheduled a Washington newsconference for Thursday, which has been drop-out day throughoutthis presidential campaign.   A campaign source said the Tennessee senator would announce hewas halting his effort.   Arriving in Austin, Gore told reporters, ``I'm in the midst nowof consulting with friends and supporters all over the country andasking for their advice on how we can best continue the cause forwhich I have been fighting.''   Gore's departure from the race would narrow the field to MichaelDukakis, firmly established after his New York victory as thefront-runner, and Jesse Jackson.   On paper, Gore's strategy for winning the nomination made somesense. But once the campaign got under way, he always seemed to bethe candidate pursuing the wrong agenda in the wrong place at thewrong time.   ``It's very difficult, if not impossible, to develop DemocraticParty support as one who plays the conservative side of thefence,'' said Peter D. Kelly, chairman of the California DemocraticParty. ``There are just not enough votes out there.''   Kelly was citing a reality of Democratic Party nominationpolitics that Southerners, who once dominated the party, now blamefor recent general election disasters _ landslide losses in threeof the last four presidential contests.   Ironically, it was Jackson, the most liberal candidate in therace but also a Southerner, who stood in the way of Gore's plan tocapture the nomination by running as the conservative.   From the start, Gore was the stranger at the Democrats'presidential party, arriving unfashionably late and standing aloneto the right of the other guests.   Gore wanted to be the Super Tuesday candidate for the Democraticpresidential nomination, but he never succeeded in attracting afollowing outside his native South. And the vote he received in theSouth on that Tuesday, March 8, was not big enough to overcome hisalso-ran showings earlier in Iowa and New Hampshire.   In hindsight, Gore's decision to pass up Iowa as too liberal andto make far less effort in New Hampshire than his rivals looks likean insurmountable mistake.   But, at the time, many Southerners thought Super Tuesday wasgoing to sharply diminish the influence of the two Northern statesthat have dominated nomination politics in both parties for 20years.   ``I always felt like, if anybody could pass up Iowa and NewHampshire, he could,'' said Kathy Vick, Louisiana Democratic Partychairman. ``That he was an exception to the unwritten rule that youhad to play in Iowa and New Hampshire.''   Gore finished last in Iowa and fifth in a seven-candidate fieldin New Hampshire.   March 8, the day nearly every Southern and border state heldprimaries, was the key to the Gore strategy. But that plan ran intothe formidable presence of Jackson as well as Dukakis' ability torun well in Florida and Texas.   Gore came out of Super Tuesday looking good, but not goodenough. In many states in the region, he and Jackson ran one-two,the senator winning some, the former civil rights activist winningothers. Either man would have done much better on Super Tuesday hadthe other not been in the contest.   Even though Super Tuesday, established Gore as one of the threeleading contenders for the nomination, he never carried anothercongressional district in subsequent primaries.   And he ended up making his last, desperate try for credibilityin a city and state that symbolized social and political viewslight years away from the South, his chief ally thatquintessential, abrasive New Yorker, Mayor Edward Koch.   Koch often overshadowed the candidate he endorsed. The mayorkept up a drumfire of attacks on Jackson, at one point, saying Jewsand other supporters of Israel would ``have to be crazy'' to votefor him.   On election night, the mayor conceded he may not have helpedGore. He said, ``I think the exit polls show that 2 to 1, peopledid not like my criticisms of Jackson.''</TEXT></DOC>
