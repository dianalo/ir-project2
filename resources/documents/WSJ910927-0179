Shestack (&quot;There's Nothing Alien About NaturalRights,&quot; editorial page, Sept. 6) espouses modern humanistic&quot;natural rights&quot; theory as the grounds of our Declaration ofIndependence and as the best philosophical basis forestablishing constitutional principles. He ignores both thehistoric foundation of our early American legal documents andthe insoluble philosophical problems of modern humanisticpolitical thought.   Our independence effort was based on Christianity,particularly on a tradition of medieval and ReformationChristian legal and political philosophy that includeddoctrines of resistance against tyranny. This tradition longantedated Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and the modern &quot;naturalrights&quot; theorists. Christian statesmen, ministers andcitizens led our drive for independence. OverwhelminglyChristian groups of statesmen gave us our Declaration ofIndependence, state constitutions, declarations of rights,bills of rights, laws, Articles of Confederation,Constitution and Bill of Rights. Christian ethics, notmodern, mancentered political thought, was the philosophicalfoundation of our original Constitution.</LP><TEXT>   Establishing modern humanistic theories of &quot;naturalrights&quot; as constitutional principles in place of thedestructive legal positivism that has dominated much20th-century Supreme Court thinking will not solve theproblems of positivism. &quot;Natural rights&quot; theory, too, is nobetter than the source of its authority. All man-centeredphilosophies self-destruct because they entail insolubleproblems of knowledge, and so have no objective basis fortheir pseudoethical claims. Modern man-centered thinkers'diverse concepts of the nature of &quot;nature&quot; destroy thepossibility of deducing consistent, non-arbitrary principlesof ethics, law or constitutional interpretation.   The only solution to the destructive chaos of legal theoryand constitutional misinterpretation that plagues us is areturn to the biblical standards of ethics and law that arethe foundation of our early American law, the Constitutionand the Bill of Rights.   Archie P. Jones   Director of Research   Plymouth Rock Foundation   Marlborough, N.H.   ---   Mr. Shestack's summary of natural law principles and theirhistorical application is admirable, and his speculation asto their influence on both liberal and conservative SupremeCourt justices' thinking is interesting. He says that if thethrust of Judge Clarence Thomas's natural law leaningsresults in the judge's reaching conclusions from concepts ofequality, his liberal soul is undisturbed.   My conservative soul isn't bothered by the judge'sleanings either. I lack Mr. Shestack's erudition, but theimpact of natural law principles on John Jarvis's thinking200 years ago, at a time when those principles were popularlydiscussed, leads me to a conclusion similar to Mr.Shestack's.   Jarvis's consideration of natural law resulted in thisentry in Deed Book 4, page 331, Office of the Clerk of theCircuit Court of Botetourt County, Fincastle, Va.:   &quot;To all whom it may concern: Know ye that I John Jarvis ofBotetourt County having in my possession a negroe Slavecalled Benn, and being deeply conscious of the injustice ofDepriving my fellow creature of his natural rights from God:Do by these presence Emansepate him, Benn, and consider himforever fully and entirely freed andamp; Delivered from me my HeirsExecutors Administrators and Assigns or any other claim orClaims whatsoever to all intents andamp; purposes according to thetrue Intention of these Presence. In witness whereof I havehereunto set my hand and seal this 7th Day of November in theYear of our Lord Christ 1791. John Jarvis, (seal).&quot;   I know it is simplistic, but when ideas have beneficialconsequences, surely they merit continuing consideration.Perhaps a little more simplicity -- and a lot more civility-- would enhance our public discourse.
