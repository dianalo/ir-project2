The metal complexbinds cooperatively to A-form helices of various base sequences underconditions where little or no binding was found to analogous B-form DNAs.Photoactivated DNA cleavage may be coupled to this conformation-specificbinding by taking advantage of the photophysical properties of ruthenium(II)complexes. {Lambda}-Ru(TMP){sub 3}{sup 2+} cleaves preferentially {sup3}H-labeled A-form polynucleotides upon irradiation with visible light.The photoinduced DNA strand scission is likely to be mediated by singletoxygen, which leads to a preferential cleavage of guanine residues. Comparativemapping of cleavage sites on a linear pBR322 fragment for tris(phenanthroline)ruthenium(II),which binds to B-DNA and cleaves also by sensitization of singlet oxygen,and for Ru(TMP){sub 3}{sup 2+} shows the selective binding of {Lambda}-Ru(TMP){sub3}{sup 2+} to conformationally distinct sites along the fragment. Thesesites correspond to 5- to 13-base-pair homopyrimidine stretches.</TEXT></DOC>
