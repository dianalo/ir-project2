But it caught oil markets -- and apparently otherOPEC members as well -- by surprise.   World oil prices fell anyway, after firming briefly on thenews. Traders apparently were disappointed by the modest sizeof the cut, only 1.2% of the kingdom's recent output ofaround 8.5 million barrels a day. It brought the total of thereductions so far to about 340,000 barrels a day for all ofOPEC, which has been producing at a decade high of more than24 million barrels a day.   In European spot markets, North Sea crudes were down asmuch as 35 cents to 45 cents a barrel, according to Dow JonesInternational Petroleum Report. On London's InternationalPetroleum Exchange, crude-oil futures were down 15 cents to28 cents a barrel.   In U.S. futures trading, crude oil for February deliverytumbled 42 cents, to $18.47 a barrel. Trading in the Februarycontract expired yesterday on the New York MercantileExchange, and that contributed to the volatility. But theMarch crude also was down sharply, settling 32 cents lower at$18.72 a barrel.   Also, late yesterday, leading U.S. refiners were reducingfield postings for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkcrude, by 50 cents, to $17.25 a barrel.   Still, for Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter,the production cut was an unprecedented move. Oil economistsand analysts called it a significant development that islikely to have a long-range, if not a short-term, impact onoil markets and the world oil industry -- and perhaps onU.S.-Saudi relations as well.   &quot;The oil markets will read this correctly as a gesture,&quot;said Lawrence Goldstein, president of the Petroleum IndustryResearch Foundation, New York, &quot;but it's a political, not aneconomic, gesture.&quot;   Mr. Goldstein and others suggested the cut should end thestinging criticism directed at the Saudis by Iran and someothers in OPEC in recent weeks. That, in turn, will help theSaudis get down to the &quot;real&quot; business on future outputsharing when oil ministers meet in Geneva Feb. 12 to setsecond-quarter output.   &quot;The Saudis believe this is a watershed meeting,&quot;said Mr.Goldstein.   It is understood that the Saudis hold the position thatfuture changes in OPEC's output levels should be shared on apro rata basis by the 13 OPEC members, excluding Iraq andKuwait at the moment. Also, they insist the commondenominator for determining the share of OPEC's output for anindividual country should be its own production capacity.   As a result, even though future OPEC cutbacks would trimSaudi volumes in actual barrels more than others, thisapproach would ensure a minimum share of 35% of OPEC's outputfor the kingdom and probably a much larger portion as theSaudi capacity grows.   Equally important, analysts said, the strategy of cuttingoutput before the meeting not only signals Saudi concernabout the fall in oil prices but helps distance the kingdomfrom the theory -- widely held in OPEC and on Wall Street,and perhaps in Washington as well -- that it is in collusionwith the Bush administration to hold prices down to help himget re-elected.   &quot;The last thing they want is for their OPEC colleagues tothink that they are in the pockets of the U.S.,&quot; said JosephC. Story, Middle East expert and president of Gulf ConsultingServices, Washington.   Alarmed at the $5-a-barrel fall in oil prices just sinceOctober, other OPEC members announcing immediate cuts inproduction volumes before the Feb. 12 meeting are Venezuela,Libya, Nigeria, Iran, Algeria and Qatar. Several had calledon Saudi Arabia, where production had increased the mostafter the Persian Gulf crisis began, to reduce its output aproportionate amount immediately.   Until yesterday, however, Saudi Arabia had been expectedto continue pumping oil at a near-capacity rate of 8.5million barrels a day -- more than one-third of OPEC's totaloutput -- at least until the oil ministers meet next month.Still, even though Mr. Nazer announced a cut twice as largeas any others, he claimed oil markets had over-reacted tohigh output reports.   &quot;I see no justification for a sharp drop in market prices,since figures published about the volume of production ofOPEC countries are higher than what is actually beingproduced,&quot; Mr. Nazer said. Still, he added, &quot;we hope thatafter these measures, the normal state of affairs will bere-established.&quot;   Even though prices continued to decline in tradingyesterday after Mr. Nazer's announcement, oil analystssuggested that a pricing bottom may be near. And some saidthat OPEC may not have to cut production much more for thesecond quarter even though there is a usual seasonalweakening in oil demand for that period.   If there is a normal rebuilding of oil inventories in thesecond quarter, &quot;I don't see the need for OPEC to cut morethan one million barrels a day to balance the market,&quot; saidBryan Jacoboski, oil analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in NewYork.</TEXT></DOC>
