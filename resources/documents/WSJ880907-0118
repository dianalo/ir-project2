The report by the congressional Office of Technology Assessment said, &quot;Today's classrooms typically resemble their ancestors of 50 years ago more closely than operating rooms or business offices resemble their 1938 versions.&quot;    The agency estimated that schools have spent $2 billion on computer hardware in the past decade. There are now 1.2 million to 1.7 million computers in public schools, and fewer than 5% have no computers.    But the agency said it would cost $4 billion to buy enough equipment to reduce the student-computer ratio from 30-1 to 3-1.    The 246-page report, based on two years of research, said that between 1981 and 1987, the number of schools equipped with computers for instructional use grew to 95% from 18%.    But &quot;the vast majority of schools still do not have enough of them to make the computer a central element of instruction,&quot; it said.    Computers are not the only new machines in U.S. classrooms.    &quot;The 1980s witnessed a tremendous expansion in school use of advanced technology of all types,&quot; the report said.    &quot;In 1980 very few schools had videocassette recorders. Today roughly 90% do,&quot; it said, adding that the availability of cable and satellite transmission has made the television a more potent teaching tool -- especially for schools in remote areas.    &quot;In practice there is wide disparity -- one computer in a classroom, clusters of computers in the library or classrooms, full computer laboratories and classrooms with no computers,&quot; it said. &quot;Not all students use computers and . . . those who do spend on average a little more than one hour per week on the computer.&quot;    The report said that &quot;although new interactive technologies cannot alone solve the problems of American education, they have already contributed to important improvements in learning. These tools can play an even greater role . . . both by helping children acquire basic skills and by endowing them with more sophisticated skills so they can acquire and apply knowledge over their lifetimes.&quot;    To tap the potential of technology, the report said, &quot;A greater investment will be necessary,&quot; including a more active federal role in spurring research and helping spread the new teaching tools.    The report warned that &quot;the vast majority of those now teaching or planning to teach have had little or no computer education or training.&quot; Most of what they have been taught is how to use computers themselves, not how to teach with computers.    &quot;Despite a nationwide call to improve teaching, there is almost no federal money for the training of new teachers,&quot; it said.    It said there are more than 10,000 educational software products on the market, but the quality &quot;could be much better.&quot;    The Office of Technology Assessment is a nonpartisan analytical agency for Congress.    Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, (D., Calif.), chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor, which commissioned the study, said increasing federal support for high-tech school aids &quot;would be good public policy and a wise investment for the future.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
