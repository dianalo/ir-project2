Benign and malignant changes of the pleura caused by asbestosas well are recognized as occupational diseases in the FRG as are lungfibroses due to anorganic and organic dusts. The most important exogeno-allergicalveolites are the farmer lung, the bird raiser lung, and the humidifierlung that is mainly found in printing plants. The most frequent occupationalasthma is the flour dust asthma. Its causes, i.e. baking material suchas amylase, hemicellulase, and soya bean meal, are often not recognized.Allergic, chemoirritant or toxically caused obstructive bronchial diseasesalso develop due to isocyanates inhaled in the production of syntheticsand lacquers and due to aliphatic amines frequently used as solvents.There are no proven, generally acknowledged findings on the relationbetween air pollution in our broader environment and diseases of therespiration organs yet. Contradictory results of individual epidemiologicanalyses are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
