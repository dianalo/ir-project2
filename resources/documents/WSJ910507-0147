But while most people recall the Main Street five-and-dimewith nostalgia, their grandchildren might not remember it atall if current trends continue. During the 1980s, the numberof variety stores in the U.S. plummeted 38% to 10,720 from17,400 -- the worst pummeling of any retailing sector in thedecade, according to Audits andamp; Surveys Inc., a marketingresearch company.</LP><TEXT>   From all directions, the core customers of variety storeswere enticed away. The malls that were sprouting across thecountry lured the browsers and one-stop shoppers. The toyemporiums wooed the kids. The discounters snagged the pennypinchers. And the specialty stores pulled in just abouteverybody.   To top it off, other retail segments, notably drugstores,supermarkets and service stations, began poaching on the dimestores' territory, adding everything from combs to Halloweenmasks to their shelves. &quot;The lines of demarcation used to beclear. Now, they're not,&quot; says Solomon Dutka, head of Auditsandamp; Surveys.   With the climate worsening in the current recession, manyindependent variety stores are deciding the best strategy isto hunker down, tinker with displays but don't revamp them,keep the surroundings plain and keep plodding along.   &quot;We're sticking to the basics,&quot; says Phil Bucking, ownerof the Sag Harbor Variety Store in Sag Harbor, N.Y. &quot;We stillsell pots and pans and socks and thread. We're not intofads.&quot;   Adds Paul Spigel, owner of Silverman's on the Plaza inLivingston, N.J. &quot;I've tried not to be exotic. For me, it wasexotic to move into helium balloons two months ago.&quot; A nearbycompetitor that branched out into one-hour photo developingand gift baskets went bust recently, he says.   In Union, N.J., John Massa paces the aisles of his VarietyFair in a small shopping plaza. He fusses over displays,straightens a stack of pantyhose packets and picks up a pieceof litter from the floor. Variety Fair is the lone survivorof a chain of five that Mr. Massa and a partner ran for manyyears. They closed two, sold one and changed the other into acard-and-gift shop. &quot;They all had their run but they justreached their saturation point while salaries and rents keptescalating,&quot; he says. In Union, two rival variety stores haveclosed in the past few years.   Still, dime stores will always thrive if the location isright and the rent stays reasonable, Mr. Massa asserts. Andsticking to fundamentals is still the best way to make money.&quot;You have to have that left-handed screwdriver the customercan't find anywhere else,&quot; he says.   Trying to go up-market would lead to disaster, hebelieves, for it would run counter to the time-tested &quot;imageof cheap.&quot; Instead, Variety Fair simply adds products to takeaccount of shifting tastes and trends -- such as yellowribbons and even yellow shower curtains during the PersianGulf war -- and eliminates slow sellers. It has scaled backits lampshades section while expanding baseball-cardofferings, for example. &quot;But there's been no basic overhaul,&quot;he says.   Mr. Massa, who at age 60 has spent half his life in thedime-store business, isn't letting the harsher environmentget him down. &quot;I'm still actively looking for places&quot; to opennew stores, he says.   His philosophy of simplicity is shared by Al and ZinaSchaefer, owners of the H.E. Rowe Variety Store in Maplewood,N.J. Like Mr. Massa, they put in long hours, greet regularsby name, and manage to hold on to trusted employees foryears, not just months.   They too keep alert to new fashions, noting that thefavorite color in housewares has shifted to white and almondfrom brown four years ago. But they hold fast to someproducts that have lost popular appeal, such as old-fashionedstockings that have to be held up with a garter belt andstill are in style with some elderly women.   &quot;We try to have necessity items, items people use everyday, not fancy, unique, boutique items,&quot; says Mr. Schaefer,who is 59. &quot;More people have got a dollar than have got$100.&quot;   The original H.E. Rowe chain counted six or seven stores,he says, and &quot;I'm the last one.&quot; He plays on the public'snostalgia for dime stores, keeping the original hardwoodflooring and some shelves that date back more than twodecades.   The contraction of the independents' business is mirroredin the larger chains. Between 1980 and 1990, Woolworth Corp.reduced the number of its &quot;general-merchandise&quot; dime storesto a little more than 1,000, which include a growing numberof Woolworth Express stores, from 1,300, says Barry Thomson,a vice president. &quot;We've gone off on a new strategicdirection -- specialty retailing,&quot; he says.   But the small entrepreneurs usually can't afford to shiftgears, so they keep plugging away. The realization that theyare of a dying breed is strong for some. &quot;There used to beone or two {variety stores} in every town,&quot; says Mr. Buckingof Sag Harbor Variety Store. &quot;Now we're the only one left inthis whole area.&quot;   Yet, the hunkering-down strategy is paying off,variety-store owners say. Mr. Massa of Variety Fair saysrevenue is up slightly this year after a rough 1990, andprofits remain healthy. &quot;We'll be around for a while,&quot; hesays. Mr. Bucking says profits and revenue are keeping pacewith inflation, despite the recession.   Mr. Spigel of Silverman's predicts he'll not only survive,but continue making a comfortable profit for years ahead. Hecredits his conservative instincts for that. He had a chancesix years ago to expand into a big-volume operation when asupermarket next door went out of business. &quot;I was tempted tomove into that space,&quot; he recalls. &quot;It's five times the sizeof my place. I'm glad I didn't. I would have gone in over myhead.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
