The reporters demanded the reinstatement of the editor ofChina's most outspoken newspaper, who was fired last week.   But they also called for a dialogue with government officials onbroader issues of censorship, reflecting increasing dissatisfactionwith a media system in which much of their work is never released.   The reporters, many of whom are members of the ruling CommunistParty, said their action was prompted in part by tight governmentlimits on reporting of student protests over the past few weeks.The students have called for press freedom and other democraticreforms, but only a few newspapers have reported the scale andpopularity of their marches.   ``We all know there is no press freedom in our country, and thatwe reporters all want press freedom,'' a reporter for the EconomicStudies Weekly told a gathering of about 60 colleagues at the LuXun Museum in Beijing.   Lu Xun was a short story writer and essayist famous for hissharp criticism of the government in the 1920s and 1930s.   The reporters, from all of China's leading papers including theparty mouthpiece, the People's Daily, expressed anger over thefiring of Qin Benli, editor of the Shanghai-based weekly, the WorldEconomic Herald.   Shanghai officials fired Qin for ``violations of discipline''after he refused to alter the paper's April 24 edition. The issuecontained articles that called for a reassessment of late partychief Hu Yaobang, who was ousted in 1987 allegedly for being tooliberal. Shanghai officials said the articles were ``likely tocause disturbances.''   Hu's death April 15 sparked marches, sit-ins and a class boycottby tens of thousands of college students in the largest protest in40 years of communist rule.   The reporters drafted a letter to be sent to government andparty leaders demanding Qin's reinstatement, an open apology byShanghai officials and a dialogue with officials on ``illegalinterference'' in reporting.   ``If we can achieve our goals regarding the World EconomicHerald, then we believe we will have advanced a step in ourstriving for press freedom in our country,'' said the EconomicStudies Weekly reporter, who like many others did not want his nameused.   The reporters at the meeting promised to collect signatures attheir workplaces.   They also made plans to demonstrate Thursday outside the officesof the state-run Xinhua News Agency, which generally sets the linefor other official media to follow in reporting sensitive stories.   Thursday is the 70th anniversary of a 1919 student protest thatbegan what became known as the May Fourth Movement, a campaignagainst foreign imperialism and for scientific and democraticreform. It was China's first student protest.   The current student protesters have carried banners declaring,``The press should speak the truth,'' and shouted, ``The People'sDaily, complete nonsense!''   ``It's exciting. The intellectuals in China won't stand morepressure from the government,'' said a TV journalist. ``There isstrict censorship every day.''   She said reports were held up for hours, sometimes days, by``lots of officials who want to say yes or no'' on each one, evenif the content is not particularly sensitive.   Science and Technology Daily was the first to break a mediablackout on the student protests when it said that studentsgathered to mourn Hu also were chanting slogans for democracy andfreedom. The paper's editors agreed to publish the report onlyafter the reporters threatened to resign en masse.   The Peasant's Daily, Beijing Youth News and Chinese Women's Newseach have reported once on the protests with enough detail to givereaders an idea of the unprecedented size and daringness of them.Other papers have carried only sparse, understated Xinhua reports.   Dozens of Chinese reporters have covered the protests, but saidtheir editors have tossed out their reports.   One photographer, asked at a protest why he was bothering totake pictures, replied: ``For history.''</TEXT></DOC>
