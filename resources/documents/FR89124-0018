The C.S.D., in accord with thecoastwise laws which provide that no foreign vessel may transport merchandisebetween points in the U.S., either directly or via a foreign port, or forany part of the transportation, held that the carrying vessel in this kindof movement must be coastwise qualified, i.e., U.S. owned, built and properlydocumented. The changing of the C.S.D., as requested in a petition foran interpretive ruling, would have permitted, insofar as the coastwiselaws were concerned, the carriage by a foreign-built launch barge or anouter continental shelf platform jacket from a point in the U.S. to a pointoutside U.S. territorial waters where the jacket would be unloaded fromthe barge and then towed to an installation site on the U.S. outer continentalshelf.The petitioner, in its submission, had contended that towing is not ``transportation''and a vessel is not ``merchandise'' for the purposes of the coastwise laws.It noted that qualified barges capable of launching a deepwater jacketare nonexistent and it is economically impracticable for anyone to buildsuch a barge in the U.S. because of competitive pressures from foreignmarine fabricators.

Hegland, Carrier RulingsBranch, (202-566-5706).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>By notice published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 29, 1987 (52 FR 24169), it was announcedthat Customs was inviting public comments on the issues raised in a petitionrequesting that Customs reconsider its ruling in C.S.D. 85-9, publishedin 19 Cust. Bull. 508, January 20, 1985. Customs held in C.S.D. 85-9, thatthe movement of a vessel on another vessel from a coastwise point to apoint on the high seas where the vessel is removed from the carrying vesseland then towed to another coastwise point is considered coastwise trade.The carrying vessel in that kind of movement must be U.S. owned, built,and properly documented pursuant to 46 U.S.C. App. 883. The notice specifiedthat if the previous ruling were changed, it would permit, insofar as thecoastwise laws were concerned, the carriage by a foreign-built launch bargeof an outer continental shelf (OCS) platform jacket from a point in theU.S. to a point outside U.S. territorial waters where the jacket wouldbe unloaded from the barge and then towed to an installation site on theU.S. outer continental shelf. It further noted that the petitioner contendedthat towing is not ``transportation'' and a vessel is not ``merchandise''for the purposes of the coastwise laws. In addition, the petitioner statedthat qualified barges capable of launching a deepwater jacket are nonexistentand it is economically impracticable for anyone to build such a barge inthe U.S. because of competitive pressures from foreign marine fabricators.The petitioner also stated that the previous Customs ruling did not serveto promote the American merchant marine or domestic shipbuilding industryand that it tended to prevent the domestic fabrication industry from participatingin deepwater projects. Petitioner's arguments were fully set out in thenotice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Law 100-329</ITAG>Since publication of the notice, Congress has recognized the lack of coastwise-qualifiedlaunch barges capable of launching deepwater jackets in Pub. L. 100-329.Under Pub. L. 100-329, transportation on certain launch barges of largeplatform jackets between points in the United States at one of which thereis an installation or other device within the meaning of the Outer ContinentalShelf Lands Act (OCSLA) would not be deemed transportation subject to section883. A launch barge with a carrying capacity of 12,000 long tons or morewhich was built or under construction as of the date of enactment of Pub.L. 100-329 and was documented under the laws of the United States couldbe used to transport a platform jacket which could not be transported onand launched from a barge of lesser capacity.Part of the motivation for the launch barge provision in Pub. L. 100-329was C.S.D. 85-9 (January 28, 1988, Hearings of the Subcommittee on MerchantMarine, U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation).However, passage of Pub. L. 100-329 does not make moot the issue consideredin this interpretive ruling. The question of the applicability of the coastwiselaws to dual-mode movements still exists with regard to the movement ofplatform jackets between points other than sites on the OCS, as well asto the movement of articles other than platform jackets not exempted fromthe provisions of section 883 by Pub. L. 100-329.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments</ITAG>Seventeen comments were submitted in response to the proposed interpretativerule published on June 29, 1987. An analysis of the comments follows:<ITAG tagnum="85">Comments Agreeing with Petitioner that C.S.D. 85-9 Should be Modified</ITAG>All of the commenters agreeing with the petitioner that C.S.D. 85-9 shouldbe modified gave economic or practical, non-legal reasons for doing so.These arguments include the claim that C.S.D. 85-9 promotes the exportationof the jacket fabricating industry and the jobs associated therewith.Also included in these arguments is the claim that there are no coastwise-qualifiedlaunch barges capable of launching the jackets required for deepwater sites.Such arguments contend that there is too much uncertainty in the marketto promote construction of coastwise-qualified barges.Another such contention is that because the use of transportation alternativesnot requiring coastwise-qualified barges, such as the fabrication of jacketsabroad or the modification of OCS development plans, could increase projectcosts and risks, development of the OCS may be deferred. This consequence,according to the argument, could damage the domestic fabrication industry,ship building and offshore supply industries as well as overall UnitedStates national energy security and the domestic oil industry.Three of the commenters agreeing with the petitioner that C.S.D. 85-9 shouldbe modified have submitted virtually identical substantial legal argumentson the issue. These commenters claim that the position of Customs beforeC.S.D. 85-9 was a correct interpretation of the relevant laws and shouldcontinue to be the position of Customs. Because a violation of 46 U.S.C.App. 883 calls for a severe penalty, the commenters state that it is wellestablished that section 883 should be construed strictly.The commenters recount the history and evolution of the applicable statutes,46 U.S.C. App. 883 (enacted in 1920 as the Jones Act and amended many timessince, although its antecedents can be traced back to 1817) and section316(a) (enacted in 1940 and recently amended by the Act of May 19, 1986(Pub. L. 99-307, 100 Stat. 447), although its antecedents can be tracedback to 1866). The commenters state that the two statutes are somewhatsimilar, although the prohibition in section 316(a) is directed againstthe towing vessel and that of section 883 is against the merchandise transported.The commenters use an Opinion of the Attorney General (30 Op. Att'y Gen.3 (1919)) to trace the evolution of the language of section 883. The commenterscontend that this Opinion of the Attorney General makes it clear that the``transportation'' which was prohibited by the predecessor of section 883,when it refers to transportation by water, means transportation by water<T3>in vessels. </T3>The commenters contend that this interpretation isbuttressed by a word-by-word and phrase-by-phrase analysis of section 883.The commenters state that there were no changes in sections 883 and 316(a)between 1940 and the issuance of C.S.D. 85-9 warranting or necessitatingthe change in Customs position made by C.S.D. 85-9. There were many consistentrulings with regard to dual-mode transportation issued by Customs duringthis period, according to the commenters. Further, there were no decisionsby any courts interpreting the statutes or these rulings, although thecommenters describe an order, subsequently vacated, of the United StatesDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Beaumont Division (concerningthe movement of a floating drydock from Hawaii to Texas which was describedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice) which held that the dual-mode transportationin that case would not violate 46 U.S.C. App. 316(a) or 883.The commenters note that although Customs concluded in C.S.D. 85-9 thatthe so-called ``mystical transformation'' theory underlying the dual-modeexception from applicability of the coastwise laws made no sense, Customsalso recognized that the key to determining the applicability of section883 to such movements was whether the vessel or article was <T3>transported </T3>between coastwise points. The commenters state thatthe error of C.S.D. 85-9 was the omission of the words ``in a vessel''after ``transportation'' as the key in determining the applicability ofsection 883. Contending that the key word in the phrase ``or for any partof the transportation'' in the statute is the word ``transportation,''the commenters conclude that ``transportation'' in this phrase includes``merchandise transported <T3>by water between points in the United States in any vessel.''</T3>The commenters contend that the whole to which ``any part'' in the abovephrase refers is ``the transportation'' which the commenters claim means``transported <T3>by water between points in the United States in a vessel.'' </T3>Thecommenters state that the substitution in the 1920 Act of ``transportation''for ``voyage'' was made because the addition of the phrase ``or by landand water'' meant that some transportation could be done other than bywater in a vessel but that, where only water transportation is involved,transportation has the same meaning as voyage previously had, ``transportedby water in a vessel.'' Thus, the commenters contend, for section 883 toapply to an all-water movement, there must be a loading of merchandisein a vessel at one United States coastwise point and a transportation inthat or another vessel to another United States coastwise point where thecargo is offloaded from the vessel.The commenters note that Customs has indicated that sections 883 and 316(a)are to be construed <T3>in pari materia </T3>but that each statute has its own applicationand operates to the exclusion of the other. The transportation of merchandise<T3>in </T3>a vessel and the towing of a vessel <T3>by </T3>another vessel are two different modes of transportation as,the commenters state, Congress has recognized by enacting separate statutes.Further, these commenters contend, there is no legislative history to indicatethat the statutes should not be considered and treated separately (i.e.,there is no legislative history indicating that transportation betweencoastwise points via a non-coastwise point <T3>in </T3>a vessel should be linked to towing <T3>by </T3>a vessel).In examining Customs rulings to illustrate the applicability and interpretationof sections 316(a) and 883, the commenters cite Customs rulings holdingthat ``for there to be a coastwise transportation subject to (section 883),there must be a lading of merchandise at one coastwise point and a transportationof the merchandise to another coastwise point where it is unladen,'' orsimilar words to the same effect. The commenters note that Customs hasheld that ``a towing operation is not such a transportation <T3>in </T3>a vessel as will give rise to a penalty under the first portionof section 883 Title 46'' and that ``[t]he prohibition in section 883 isapplicable to merchandise transported in the coastwise trade <T3>in </T3>a non-coastwise-qualified vessel.'' There is no such transportationby the tug when towing a vessel, according to the commenter, citing C.S.D.82-74. Since in the dual-mode movement described by the petitioner thereis no loading and unloading of the platform jacket on and from the tug,but only on and from the transporting vessel, the commenters contend thatsection 883 does not apply to such a movement.In the dual-mode movement described by the petitioner, the commenters reiterate,merchandise will only be carried between the point in the United Statesat which the platform jacket will be loaded <T3>in </T3>the carrying vessel to a point outside the territorial watersof the United States where the platform jacket will be unloaded from thatvessel. Because a towing operation is not transportation <T3>in </T3>a vessel, the entire transportation <T3>in </T3>a vessel is between a coastwise point and a non-coastwise point.The commenters offer several scenarios to help trace the evolution andapplication of section 883 and to illustrate the ``absurdity'' of C.S.D.85-9. The commenters state that in a dual-mode movement in which a platformjacket is transported in a coastwise-qualified vessel from a coastwisepoint to a non-coastwise point and is towed by a non-coastwise-qualifiedvessel from the latter point to another coastwise point, the towing segmentof the movement would be prohibited by 46 U.S.C. App. 883, even thoughit would not be prohibited by 46 U.S.C. App. 316(a) and the carriage segmentof the movement would not be prohibited by 46 U.S.C. App. 883. This, thecommenters state, is an absurd result which follows from failing to recognizedthe presence of the phrase ``in any vessel'' and its effect on the meaningof the term ``transportation.''These commenters on the legal aspects of this issue also contend that Customsfailed, in its issuance of C.S.D. 85-9, to follow its established (see19 CFR Part 177) procedures for issuance of a ruling which has the effectof changing a position of the Customs Service which results in a restrictionor prohibition. The commenters cite 19 CFR 177.10(c)(2) which requirespublication in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of notice that such a change in position is underreview and that interested parties be given an opportunity to comment onthe correctness of the contemplated change.The commenters state that by the issuance of C.S.D. 85-9, changing itsposition on the subject of that C.S.D. and treating the position adoptedin the C.S.D. as the current Customs position, Customs improperly placesthe burden of modifying or changing the positon back to the one existingbefore C.S.D. 85-9 on the petitioner or others who would seek a rulingpermitting a movement which would be prohibited under C.S.D. 85-9. Thecommenters submit that comments on this matter should address the issueof whether the position of Customs before C.S.D. 85-9 was correct or, ifnot, should be modified, and the position of the petitioner should be approvedbased on the long-standing interpretations of Customs.Comments Opposing Modification of C.S.D. 85-9Several of the commenters opposing modification of C.S.D. 85-9 concedethat there may not be coastwise-qualified launch barges capable of launchingdeepwater platforms on the OCS. Another commenter states that permittingthe petitioner's proposed movement would not result in any benefit to UnitedStates shipbuilders or owners; the only benefit would be to United Statesmanufacturers of platform jackets and foreign manufacturers of launch bargesand tugs.Most of the commenters opposing the modification of C.S.D. 85-9 took theposition that the economic arguments, including the possible absence ofcoastwise-qualified launch barges capable of launching deep-water platforms,are irrelevant to Customs determination of the applicability of the coastwiselaws. These commenters contend that the proper forum for considerationof such factors is the United States Congress. Customs responsibility withregard to the coastwise laws, according to these commenters, is to enforcethose laws as written, regardless of the economic effect of such enforcement.In this regard, several of these commenters point out that there are existingwaiver mechanisms, both administrative and legislative, which could allowforeign-built launch barges to be used for the launching of United Statesorigin platforms on the OCS. These commenters refer to the provision forwaiver of the coastwise laws in the interest of national defense underthe Act of December 27, 1950 (64 Stat. 1120), and special legislation grantingparticular vessels the right to engage in the coastwise trade. Grantingthe petitioner's request by means of an interpretative ruling instead ofusing one of these waiver mechanisms would, according to one of these commenters,set a harmful precedent. Legally, most of the commenters opposing modification of C.S.D. 85-9 contendthat the dual-mode movement which the petitioner proposes should be permitted,is a violation of the coastwise laws and the intent of those laws whichis, to protect and develop the American merchant marine. In this regard,one commenter refers to the case of <T3>Port Royal Marine Corp. v. United States,</T3> 378 F. Supp. 345 (S.D.Ga. 1974), <T3>aff'd</T3>, 420 U.S. 901 (1975), as an illustration of its contentionthat 46 U.S.C. App. 883 should be construed broadly in the face of technologicaladvances so as to continue to fulfill its Congressional purpose.Several of the commenters opposing modification of C.S.D. 85-9 state thatthe petitioner's argument that a dual-mode movement is not within the coastwiselaws, would result in a loophole in the coastwise laws. One of these commentersstates that a dual-mode movement is not different than the transportationin a vessel of cargo from a United States point to a foreign point wherethe cargo is unloaded and laden onto another vessel and transported toanother United States port. Another of these commenters points out thatunder the dual-mode interpretation advocated by the petitioner, a rig couldbe towed on a non-coastwise-qualified vessel 99\9/10\ miles to a platforminstallation site 100 miles from the United States mainland and launchedto be towed on its own bottom the remaining \1/10\ mile. A third commenterstates that the petitioner's construction of 46 U.S.C. App. 316(a) and883 requires a narrow reading of those statutes which is inconsistent withCongressional intent.Several commenters contend that the petitioner's argument is faulty inthe assumption that the towage of a platform does not constitute ``transportation''of merchandise under 46 U.S.C. App. 883. One of these commenters cites<T3>Cornell Steamboat Co. v. U.S.A.</T3>, 321 U.S. 634 (1944), in whichthe Supreme Court held that towage was included within the term ``transportation,''as that term is utilized in the Interstate Commerce Act.Another of these commenters, citing <T3>Borough of Brielle v. Zeigler,</T3> 179 A. 2d 789 (1962), and <T3>In the Matter of the Application of Newton Creek Towing Company,</T3>199 N.Y.S. 866 (1923), states that ``transportation'' is generally definedas the system or modes of conveyance of persons or goods from one placeto another and has been interpreted to include movement by towing vessels,i.e., tugs.One commenter contends that since 46 U.S.C. App. 883 provides that ``nomerchandise shall be transported by water, or by land and water, * * *or <T3>for any part of the transportation</T3> in any other vessel than a[coastwise qualified vessel]'' (emphasis supplied by commenter), the statutecontemplates that its provisions will apply where part of the transportationis effected by modes of conveyance other than a carrier vessel withoutexclusion of conveyance by towing for a portion of the movement.Citing <T3>American Maritime Association v. Blumenthal, supra,</T3> 32 Op. Att'yGen. 350 (1920), 34 Op. Att'y Gen. 355 (1924), and <T3>The Bermuda,</T3> 70 U.S. 514, 553 (1865), the commenter states that46 U.S.C. App. 883 applies where goods are loaded at a coastwise point,unloaded at a foreign point, and reloaded on another vessel for a coastwisedestination. The commenter recognizes that in <T3>Blumenthal,</T3> 46 U.S.C. App. 883 was held not to be applicable becausethere was no continuity of movement of cargo between two United Statescoastwise points. The commenter states that the inference drawn from <T3>Blumenthal</T3> and set forth in a final rule of Customs in its amendmentof 19 CFR 4.80b at 44 FR 42177 (19/9), that where merchandise being transportedby vessel between coastwise points does not undergo substantial changeat an intermediate non-coastwise point, but is merely transshipped, theshipper's intent should control, supports the interpretation in C.S.D.85-9.The commenter states that in the situation described in the proposed interpretiverule, the shipper intends the drilling jacket to move from a United Statescoastal point to a point on the OCS which is subject to the coastwise law.The commenter states that the intended intermediate stop on the high seasis not a break in the continuity of the voyage that would create two separatenon-coastwise voyages. According to the commenter, the lowering of thedrilling jacket from the barge to the water for tow is analogous to a transshipmentwhere two modes of transportation are employed to achieve a single coastwisemovement subject to 46 U.S.C. App. 883 and, as a result, a violation wouldoccur where a non-coastwise-qualified vessel was used for the carryingportion of the transportation.Several commenters dispute the petitioner's arguments that the coastwiselaws do not apply to dual-mode movements of the kind described in the noticebecause a drilling jacket should be treated as merchandise when carriedon another vessel and as a vessel, not ``merchandise,'' for purposes of46 U.S.C. App. 883, when being towed. One commenter argues that the launchingof the jacket does not ``miraculously'' convert the jacket from merchandiseto a vessel in such a way to avoid application of 46 U.S.C. App. 883, noris the launching of the jacket from the launch barge enough of an interruptionof the transportation to remove the movement from the confines of thatstatute (citing <T3>American Maritime Association v. Blumenthal, supra</T3>). Another commenterstates that it agrees with Customs position, which the commenter statesis apparent from C.S.D. 85-9, that the drilling jacket described in theproposed interpretive rule would be ``merchandise,'' for purposes of 46U.S.C. App. 883, during its entire movement, both while aboard the carryingbarge and while under tow. A third commenter contends that this argumentis faulty because the drilling jacket is not a ``vessel,'' as that termis utilized in 46 U.S.C. App. 316(a), citing the definitions of ``vessel''in 1 U.S.C. 3 and 46 U.S.C. App. 801 and a number of court decisions, aswell as other authorities. Because the drilling jacket is not a ``vessel,''the commenter states, it is not within the scope of 46 U.S.C. App. 316(a).One commenter disagrees with the petitioner's contention that maintenanceof Customs current position under C.S.D. 85-9 would have ``mischievous''consequences because of a conflict between 46 U.S.C. App. 883 and the ``vesselin distress'' provision of 46 U.S.C. App. 316(a). Because the intent ofthe coastwise laws is not to impede the protection of life and propertyat sea, the commenter finds it impossible to believe that a tug operator,obligated by United States and international law to come to the aid ofa vessel in distress, would be penalized for doing so.One commenter states that C.S.D. 85-9 was a proper exercise of Customspowers as an administrative agency. The commenter recognizes that Customs,as part of the Department of the Treasury, is an administrative agencycharged with, among other things, the interpretation and enforcement ofthe coastwise laws. Further, the commenter states that Customs, in theexercise of its rulemaking powers, is subject to the principles of administrativelaw. Citing several court cases in support, including two of the SupremeCourt, the commenter states that an administrative agency may abandon precedentin certain situations. If an agency does decide to depart from precedent,the commenter notes, it is required to explain its reasoning in doing so.The commenter contends that Customs adequately explained its decision tomodify its prior decisions in C.S.D. 85-9 and that that decision is thereforevalid.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis</ITAG>With regard to the contention that Customs failed to follow its proceduresin issuing C.S.D. 85-9 and improperly shifted the burden of modifying orchanging that position back to the position taken by Customs before C.S.D.85-9, we recognize that the issuance of C.S.D. 85-9 may not have been inaccordance with the Customs procedures set forth in andSection; 177.10(c)(2),Customs Regulations (19 CFR 177.10(c)(2)). We disagree with the argumentthat C.S.D. 85-9 shifted the burden of modifying or changing Customs position.In our reconsideration of C.S.D. 85-9 and our consideration of the petition,we have carefully considered all evidence submitted to us on the matteras well as any other pertinent evidence or considerations on the properinterpretation of the coastwise laws with regard to the issues consideredin C.S.D. 85-9 and raised by the petitioner. We have not presumed thatour position before the issuance of C.S.D. 85-9 was correct or incorrect,nor have we presumed that the position taken in C.S.D. 85-9 is corrector incorrect. Whether or not C.S.D. 85-9 was issued in accordance withCustoms procedures, we believe that these rulemaking procedures meet theCustoms requirements set forth in Part 177.With regard to the various economic arguments advanced, there is no provisionin the coastwise laws under which movements which would otherwise be subjectto those laws may be exempt or waived because of the economic effect onthe shipbuilding or merchant marine industries, or any other industries.Nor is there any provision for exception or waiver of those laws becauseUnited States coastwise-qualified vessels are not or will not be availableto perform such movements. Accordingly, considerations such as the lackof coastwise-qualified launch barges and the economic infeasibility ofbuilding such barges in the United States, as well as the direct and indirecteffect on the United States jacket fabricating and related industries,cannot control our interpretation of the coastwise laws.As noted by several commenters, there is a statute under which waiversof the coastwise laws can be granted, but only if necessary in the interestof national defense (see the Act of December 27, 1950 (64 Stat. 1120)).At least one such waiver has been granted under this law for the transportationof a large drilling and production jacket from the United States to a siteon the OCS. We are aware of special legislative provisions permitting specificallynamed vessels to be documented for the coastwise trade. Also, a considerablenumber of general provisos have been added to the coastwise laws underwhich non-coastwise-qualified vessels may be used to engage in activitieswhich would otherwise be considered coastwise trade. As noted above, Pub.L. 100-329, enacted on June 7, 1988, permits the use of certain non-coastwise-qualifiedlaunch barges to transport large platform jackets from U.S. points to OCSsites and launch them at those sites. We believe that the proper mechanismsfor consideration of the economic and other factors described in the previousparagraph are legislation by the Congress and/or the waiver provision.We concur with the contention that 46 U.S.C. App. 883 should be construedstrictly because it imposes a severe penalty, that of forfeiture of themerchandise transported or a monetary amount up to the value thereof. Wealso recognize that under the immediate predecessor to the 1920 Jones Act(46 U.S.C. App. 883) (section 1 of the Act of February 17, 1898 (30 Stat.248)), the movement described by the petitioner <T3>might </T3>not have been prohibited (because the 1898 Act prohibitedthe transportation of merchandise by water between ports of the UnitedStates, ``or for any part of the <T3>voyage</T3>,'' in any vessel not of the United States), depending onthe definition given to the word ``voyage'' (but see, 29 Op. Att'y Gen.572, 576 (1912), discussed <T3>infra</T3>).Section 27 of the Act of June 5, 1920 (46 U.S.C. App. 883; 41 Stat. 999,often called the Jones Act), now provides, in pertinent part, that:<ITAG tagnum="21">No merchandise shall be transported by water, or by land and water,on penalty of forfeiture of the merchandise (or a monetary amount up tothe value thereof * * *), between points in the United States * * * embracedwithin the coastwise laws, either directly or via a foreign port, or forany part of the transportation, in any other vessel than a vessel builtin and documented under the laws of the United States and owned by personswho are citizens of the United States * * *.</ITAG>Our interpretation of the parts of this provision which are applicableto a dual-mode movement is that they apply to merchandise transported bywater, or land and water, between points in the United States embracedwithin the coastwise laws in any vessel, or to any part of transportationof merchandise by water, or land and water, between points in the UnitedStates embraced within the coastwise laws when that part of the transportationis in any vessel (regardless of whether or not all of the transportationbetween points in the United States embraced within the coastwise lawsis <T3>in</T3> a vessel). To interpret the statute to apply to merchandisetransported by vessel between points in the United States embraced withinthe coastwise laws in any vessel, or to any part of transportation betweenpoints in the United States only when <T3>all</T3> of the transportation is <T3>in</T3> a vessel ignores the changes made to the 1898 Act in 1920.Clearly, transportation by land is not transportation ``<T3>in</T3> any vessel.'' Yet, just as clearly, transportation by landfrom a point in the United States to a foreign or other non-coastwise pointand by water in a non-coastwise-qualified vessel from that point to a secondpoint in the United States would be prohibited by 46 U.S.C. App. 883 asa result of the addition of the words ``or by land and water'' in the 1920Act. Thus, it is clear that not all of the transportation referred to inthe phrase ``or for any part of the transportation'' in the statute needbe <T3>in</T3> a vessel for the statute to be applicable. Another change made in the 1898 Act by the 1920 Act was the substitutionof the word ``transportation'' for the word ``voyage'' in the phrase ``orfor any part of the voyage.'' Even if the word ``voyage'' is defined narrowly,to include only movements <T3>in</T3> a vessel, so that the pre-1920 Act would not apply to the movementdescribed by the petition, it must be conceded that the word ``transportation''has a broader coverage than that narrow definition of the word ``voyage''(see <T3>Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language</T3>,2d Ed. 1953; see also the court cases cited by the commenters opposingmodification of C.S.D. 85-9 in which towage is included within the term``Transportation''). Thus, the 1920 Act broadened the ``or for any partof the transportation'' clause. It is not apparent that, as contended bythree of the commenters supporting modification of C.S.D. 85-9, this broadeningchange was intended only with regard to transportation by land and waterand not with regard to transportation by water only, nor is this apparentfrom the current statutory provision. With regard to the <T3>United States </T3>v.<T3> 1,500 Cords, More or Less, Jackpine Pulpwood</T3>, 108 F.Supp. 224(W.D. Wis. 1952), <T3>aff'd,</T3> 204 F. 2d 760 (7th Cir. 1953), Customs has taken the positionthat the <T3>1,500 Cords</T3> decision should be limited to the facts of the casein view of the limitation in the case on the application of 46 U.S.C. App.883 to transportation in interstate commerce. In any event, however, the<T3>1,500 Cords</T3> case is clearly a court decision indicating that a``transportation'' of merchandise, within the terms of 46 U.S.C. App. 883,may occur even though the merchandise transported is not actually ``in''the vessel (as noted <T3>supra,</T3> the Attorney General, in 29 Op. Att'y Gen. 572, so statedwith regard to the predecessor of 46 U.S.C. App. 883).- In our view, the ``whole'' to which the phrase, ``or for any part of thetransportation'' refers is simply defined by the words preceding it (i.e.,``no merchandise shall be transported by water, or by land and water ** * between points in the United States * * * embraced within the coastwiselaws, either directly or via a foreign port''). Thus, what is prohibitedby virtue of this clause of the statute is any part of the transportationdescribed previously by the statute, including any part of transportationby water between points in the United States embraced within the coastwiselaws when, in the words of the statute following this clause, that partof the transportation is ``in any vessel other than a [coastwise-qualified]vessel.''This interpretation does not, as stated by three of the commenters contendingthat C.S.D. 85-9 should be modified, bring about the ``absurd'' resultthat a towing vessel would be subject to 46 U.S.C. App. 883 whenever itengages in a dual-mode movement, even if the carrying part of the movementwas performed by a coastwise-qualified vessel and/or the towed vessel wasin distress. What is prohibited by virtue of the ``or for any part of thetransportation'' clause is a part of transportation by water or by landand water, when the part of the transportation is ``<T3>in </T3>any vessel other than a [coastwise-qualified] vessel.'' Ina dual-mode movement, in the segment of the movement in which the merchandiseis towed in the water, the merchandise obviously is not transported <T3>in</T3> a vessel although, as discussed above, that segment of themovement does constitute ``transportation.''The intention of 46 U.S.C. App. 883 is ``to protect the American shippingindustry already engaged in the coastwise trade, to provide work for Americanshipyards, and to improve and enhance the American Merchant Marine'' (<T3>Marine Carriers Corp. v. Fowler, </T3>429 F. 2d 702, 708 (2d Cir. 1970),<T3>cert. den.</T3>, 400 U.S. 1020 (1971)). Our interpretation of the coastwiselaws with regard to the dual-mode movement under consideration, as describedabove and as applied in C.S.D. 85-9, is consistent with this intention.Several of the commenters supporting modification of C.S.D. 85-9 limittheir arguments to the practical, economic side and state that they concurwith the legal and technical rationale offered by the petitioner. Thisrationale was summarized in the Notice. The only argument in the petitionwhich is not addressed above is that in order for there to be a coastwisetransportation within the terms of 46 U.S.C. App. 883, there must be alading of merchandise onto a vessel at one coastwise point and an unladingof the merchandise from the vessel at another coastwise point. Since, inthe dual-mode movement described in the Notice, the jacket is unladen fromthe carrying vessel at a non-coastwise point, the petitioner contends thatthere can be no coastwise transportation within the terms of 46 U.S.C.App. 883.As pointed out above in the discussion of the ``or for any part of thetransportation'' clause of 46 U.S.C. App. 883, andSection; 883 applies tothe transportation of merchandise by water, ``or by land and water.'' Intransportation by land and water (e.g., by vessel from a point in the UnitedStates to a point in Canada and by land from that point to another pointin the United States), there would not be a lading of the merchandise ontothe vessel at one coastwise point and an unlading of the merchandise fromthe vessel at another coastwise point. Thus, it is clear that a ladingof merchandise onto a vessel at one coastwise point and an unlading ofthe merchandise from the vessel at another coastwise point is not alwaysnecessary in order for transportation of merchandise to be subject to 46U.S.C. App. 883.Several of the commenters opposing modification of C.S.D. 85-9 analogizethe dual-mode movement described in the proposed interpretive rule to transportationof merchandise in one vessel from a United States point to a foreign portor to a point on the high seas where the merchandise is landed and thenloaded onto another vessel, or transshipped to another vessel, and fromwhich port or point the merchandise is transported in the second vesselto a second United States point. Although this transportation may be somewhatsimilar to the dual-mode movement described in the proposed interpretiverule, such transportation via a foreign port is actually subject to 46U.S.C. App. 883 by virtue of a different clause of that statute (``eitherdirectly or via a foreign port''). Such transportation involving a transshipmenton the high seas concerns statutory interpretive issues which are differentfrom those raised by the dual-mode movement described in the proposed interpretiverule.Some of the commenters opposing modification of C.S.D. 85-9 contend thatpermitting the dual-mode movement described in the proposed interpretiverule would create a loophole in the coastwise laws which was not intendedby the Congress, one comparing the percentage of carriage and towing insuch a movement. This may or may not be so. Our determination as to theapplicability of the coastwise laws to the dual-mode movement describedin the proposed interpretive rule must, however, be based on a clear readingand thorough consideration of the laws involved, not a mechanical weighingof the respective proportions of the carrying and towing segments in adual-mode movement or an evaluation of whether a movement is intended toevade the coastwise laws. We believe that our interpretation reflects justsuch a reading and consideration of the coastwise laws.<ITAG tagnum="84">Action</ITAG>After careful analysis of the comments and following further review ofthe matter, we find that the ruling in C.S.D. 85-9 should stand. That rulingmodified C.S.D. 80-96 and similar rulings so that the movement of a vesselon another vessel from a coastwise point to a foreign point or a pointon the high seas where the vessel is removed from the carrying vessel andthen towed onward to another coastwise point is considered coastwise trade.Accordingly, the carrying vessel in this kind of movement must be coastwise-qualified.<ITAG tagnum="84">Authority</ITAG>This document is issued under the authority of 19 U.S.C. 66, 1624; 46 U.S.C.App. 13, 316(a), 319, 802, 808, 883, 883-1, and 46 U.S.C. 12106.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal author of this document was Arnold L.
