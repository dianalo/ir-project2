Western diplomats said they believed the refinery was notdamaged, but were unsure about the port of Assab, which controlsmore than 75 percent of this East African nation's imports andexports, including emergency food relief for 7 million droughtvictims.   ``It sounds like the attack was nipped in the bud,'' said onediplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. Diplomats said it wasbelieved to be the first rebel attack on the port.   The state-run news agency reported Friday that the Ethiopiannavy blew up the boat from which rebels launched a night attackTuesday from the hilly island of Senabor, off Assab, 530 milesnortheast of Addis Ababa, the capital.   Assab and Massawa, Ethiopia's only other major port, are in theEritrea province.   The agency said the boat capsized with an unspecified number ofrebels on board. It gave no further details of the attackers' fate.The agency also did not say if the refinery or port were damaged.Nor did it indicate what type of weapons were used by the EritreanPeople's Liberation Front rebels.   ``The refinery is a source of vital fuel for surface, air andmarine transport and for industrial development in general,'' theagency said. ``The attempt of the bandits to destroy the refineryclearly demonstrates their reckless aim of engaging in suicidalmissions.''   The news agency also disclosed, in the first official report ofthe attack, that rebels of the Tigrean People's Liberation Frontrecently destroyed a microwave relay station connecting theEritrean capital, Asmara, to the rest of the country.   The report of the Assab attack is the first of its kind sincePresident Mengistu Haile Mariam ended years of official silenceMarch 30 about the two insurgencies in the northernmost neighboringprovinces of Eritrea and Tigre.   In his first admission that his government is at war, Mengistuannounced an offensive against the rebels, who have capturedseveral towns in major victories this year.   There has been no official comment on an Eritrean rebel claimthat its guerrillas on Friday shot down a MiG-21 fighter jet andcaptured the pilot.   Voice of the Broad Masses of Eritrea, the clandestine rebelradio, said the plane was downed during fighting northeast ofAsmara, in which it claimed 100 government soldiers were killed and216 wounded in a battle Thursday.   There were no foreign relief workers in Assab this week becausethe government last week expelled about 60 Western relief workersfrom Eritrea and Tigre, citing ``personnel risks'' in the war-tornarea.   The expulsions have jeopardized a massive Western-fundedemergency relief operation to help an estimated 3.2 million peoplethreatened with starvation in Eritrea and Tigre, the provincesworst hit by drought.   This week, the government allowed four U.N. workers into Asmarato supervise relief food distribution.   Western diplomats and relief officials have criticized theexpulsions and say they fear the government wants to remove foreignwitnesses from the region as it prepares for all-out war.   They have accused the government and rebels, all of whom areMarxist, of jeopardizing the lives of drought victims in pursuit ofmilitary victory.   Secessionist Eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years inAfrica's oldest civil war. Rebels in Tigre took up arms 14 yearsago demanding a bigger say in the governing of their province.</TEXT></DOC>
