Terms and Conditions of the Consent Order.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Resolution of Regulatory Issues</ITAG>Howell is a petroleum refiner and crude oil reseller subject to the auditjurisdiction of ERA to determine compliance with the Federal PetroleumPrice and Allocation Regulations. During the period covered by this proposedOrder, January 1, 1973, through January 27, 1981, Howell engaged in, amongother things, the purchase, sale, and refining of crude oil, and the saleof various refined petroleum products.ERA previously audited certain aspects of Howell's compliance with Federalpetroleum price and allocation regulations. As a result, the DOE and Howellentered into Consent Orders dated March 28, 1979, and May 10, 1979 fora total of approximately $8 million. ERA initiated another audit in 1981to examine Howell's compliance for the period beginning in January 1, 1978through January 27, 1981. During this audit, ERA identified certain areasin the pricing, refining, and sales of crude oil in which it believed thatHowell had failed to comply with the requirements of the Federal priceand allocation regulations.On June 24, 1988, ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) to Howell,Howell Hydrocarbons, Inc. (which operated a refinery in San Antonio, Texas),Howell Industries, Inc., and the Quintana-Howell Joint Venture (hereinafterJoint Venture), a Texas joint venture composed of Quintana Refinery Co.and Howell Corporation, which operated a refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas.The PRO alleged violations of 10 CFR 211.66(b) and (h), 205.202, and 210.62(c),as a result of the Joint Venture's and Howell Hydrocarbons' significantunderstatement on their respective entitlements reports of their receiptsof controlled tier crude oil at the two refineries. Specifically, ERA allegedthat during April 1978 through December 1979 the Joint Venture failed tocorrectly report the volumes of controlled tier certification associatedwith substantial volumes of its crude oil receipts at its Corpus Christi,Texas refinery. Instead, the Joint Venture reported such volumes as uncontrolledcrude oil. Likewise, the PRO alleges that Howell Hydrocarbons engaged insimilar conduct for the period April 1978, through November 1980, at itSan Antonio, Texas refinery.ERA alleges that the Joint Venture's and Howell Hydrocarbons' actions circumventedand contravened, or resulted in the circumvention and contravention of,the requirements of the Entitlements Program. As a remedy for these allegedviolations, the Proposed Remedial Order sought to recover jointly and severallyfrom Howell and Quintana Refinery Co., $10.3 million plus interest of nearly$19 million. Howell's interest in the Joint Venture represents approximately$5.4 million of the principal refund sought, plus interest of approximately$10 million.\1\<NOTE/> As well, the PRO sought $31.0 million in refunds and interestfrom Howell Hydrocarbons for similar alleged violations in its own reportingof crude oil receipts.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Quintana Refinery Company's share of the joint venture'stotal liability, $4.9 million plus interest of nearly $9 million, was resolvedby Consent Order made effective on March 9, 1989 for payment of $3.8 million.In addition, the PRO alleges that during the period April 1978 throughDecember 1979, Howell Industries improperly charged prices for crude oilin excess of its actual purchase prices by failing to provide any serviceor other function traditionally and historically associated with the resaleof crude oil, in violation of 10 CFR 212.186, 210.62(c) and 205.202. Theamount of this alleged violation is approximately $7 million with interestof an additional $13 million. Thus, ERA would seek $15.4 million from Howell,$31.0 million from Howell Hydrocarbons, and $20 million from Howell Industries.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Determination of Reasonable Settlement Amount  </ITAG>The settlement calls for Howell and its subsidiaries to pay $19,375,000,over a period of seven years to discharge in full its obligations underthe price and allocation regulations. ERA has preliminarily agreed to thesettlement amount after considering the factual aspects related to thevarious issues, assessing the litigation risks associated with establishingthe alleged overcharges, and considering the benefit to the public froma significant settlement of the issues which would take years of continuedlitigation to resolve.  Additional considerations include the current and projected economic conditionsof Howell and its subsidiaries. Nearly half of ERA's claim ($31.0 million)is against Howell Hydrocarbons, which was an approximate current worthof $4 million. Howell Industries has been inactive and without substantialassets since 1981. Howell's consolidated net worth, largerly contingenton crude oil values, was $38 million at the end of the third quarter of1988. By December 1, its net worth had declined further to approximately$37.5 million, and because of fluctuating crude oil prices, its worth increasedin January 1989 to approximately $41 million. These factors also were considerationsin determining to allow payments over a period of time. Significantly,however, approximately 40% of the total amount required to be paid pursuantto the proposed Consent Order would be paid within the first eighteen monthsof the term.  Based on all of these considerations, ERA has tentatively concluded thatthe resolution of these matters for $19,375,000 is an appropriate settlementand in the public interest.  <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Terms and Conditions of the Consent Order  </ITAG>If the Consent Order is made final, Howell will pay DOE $2 million withinthirty (30) days of the effective date of the Consent Order, $4 million,plus interest within six (6) months of the effective date and $2.5 millionplus interest within eighteen (18) months of the effective date. Remainingpayments would be made as specified in the proposed Consent Order, thetext of which is published herewith.  ERA will petition OHA to implement Special Refund Procedures under theprovision of Subpart V of the regulations. In these proceedings, OHA woulddevelop procedures for the receipt and evaluation of applications for refundin order to distribute the settlement monies. To ensure that OHA has sufficientinformation to evaluate the claims, the proposed Consent Order requiresthat Howell provide customer identification and purchase volume informationto OHA upon request.  Howell and DOE mutually release each other from claims and actions arisingunder the subject matters covered by the proposed Consent Order. The proposedOrder does not affect the right of any other party to take action againstHowell, or of Howell or the DOE to take action against any other party. <ITAG tagnum="84">Submission of Written Comments:  </ITAG>The proposed Consent Order cannot be made effective until the conclusionof the public review process, of which this Notice is a part.

This Consent Order is entered into between Howell Corporation (hereinafterreferred to as ``Howell'') and the United States Department of Energy (``DOE'').Except as otherwise provided herein, this Consent Order settles and finallyresolves all civil and administrative claims and disputes, whether or notheretofore asserted, between the DOE, as hereinafter defined, and Howell,as hereinafter defined, relating to Howell's compliance with the Federalpetroleum price and allocation regulations, as hereinafter defined, duringthe period January 1, 1973, through January 27, 1981 (all the matters settledand resolved by this Consent Order are referred to hereinafter as ``thematters covered by this Consent Order''). II. Jurisdiction, Regulatory Authority and Definitions 201. This Consent Order is entered into by the DOE pursuant to the authorityconferred upon it by sections 301 and 503 of the Department of Energy OrganizationAct (``DOE Act''), 42 U.S.C. 7151 and 7193; Executive Order No. 12009,42 FR 46267 (1977); Executive Order No. 12038, 43 FR 4957 (1978); and 10CFR 205.199J. 202. For purposes of this Consent Order, the phrase ``Federal petroleumprice and allocation regulations'' means all statutory requirements andadministrative regulations and orders regarding the pricing and allocationof crude oil, refined petroleum products, natural gas liquids, and naturalgas liquid products, including the entitlements and mandatory oil importprograms, administered by the DOE. The Federal petroleum price and allocationregulations include (without limitation) the pricing, allocation, reporting,certification, and recordkeeping requirements imposed by or under the EconomicStabilization Act of 1970, the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973,the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974, Presidential Proclamation3279, all applicable DOE regulations codified in 6 CFR Parts 130 and 150and 10 CFR Parts 205, 210, 211, 212, and 213, and all rules, rulings, guidelines,interpretations, clarifications, manuals, decisions, orders, notices, forms,and subpoenas relating to the pricing and allocation of petroleum products.The provisions of 10 CFR 205.199J and the definitions under the Federalpetroleum price and allocation regulations shall apply to this ConsentOrder except to the extent inconsistent herewith. Reference herein to ``DOE''includes, besides the Department of Energy, the Cost of Living Council,the Federal Energy Office, the Federal Energy Administration, the Officeof Special Counsel, the Economic Regulatory Administration and all predecessorand successor agencies. References in this Consent Order to ``Howell''shall include: (1) Howell Corporation and all of its subsidiaries and affiliates,(2) the Quintana-Howell Joint Venture, (3) all of Howell's petroleum-relatedactivities as refiner, producer, operator, working interest or royaltyinterest owner, reseller, retailer, natural gas processor, or otherwise,and (4) except for purposes of Article IV, <T3>infra</T3>, Howell's directors, officers, and employees. III. Facts The stipulated facts upon which this Consent Order is based are as follows:301. During the period covered by this Consent Order, Howell was a ``refiner,''``producer,'' and ``reseller'' as those terms are defined in the Federalpetroleum price and allocation regulations and was subject to the jurisdictionof the DOE. Howell engaged in, among other things, the production, importation,sale, and refining of crude oil, the sale of residual fuel oil, motor gasoline,middle distillates, aviation fuel, propane, and other refined petroleumproducts. 302. The DOE previously audited certain aspects of Howell's compliancewith the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations. As a result,the DOE and Howell entered into consent orders dated March 28, 1979, andMay 10, 1979. In 1981, the DOE initiated another audit to examine Howell'scompliance with the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations,particularly during the period of January 1, 1978 through January 27, 1981.As a result of that audit, on June 24, 1988, the DOE issued a ProposedRemedial Order to Howell. In that Proposed Remedial Order, and during thecourse of ensuing discussions with Howell, the DOE raised certain issueswith respect to Howell's application of the Federal petroleum price andallocation regulations. Howell had believed that its calculations of costs,determinations of prices, sales of crude oil and petroleum products, andother operations were in accordance with the Federal petroleum price andallocation regulations. Howell has now determined, however, that certainof the DOE's allegations likely would be sustained in the event that Howellchose to contest them. Rather than doing so, therefore, Howell has agreedto enter into this Consent Order. The DOE believes this Consent Order constitutesa satisfactory resolution of the matters covered herein and is in the publicinterest. IV. Remedial Provisions 401. In full and final settlement of all matters covered by this ConsentOrder, and in lieu of all other remedies which have been or might be soughtby the DOE against Howell for such matters under 10 CFR 205.199I or otherwise,Howell shall pay a total principal amount of nineteen million three hundredseventy-five thousand dollars ($19,375,000), plus interest, to the DOEin the manner specified in paragraphs 402 through 406.

Howell shall pay an initial principal amount of two million dollars($2,000,000) to the DOE within thirty (30) days after the effective dateof this Consent Order. 403. Howell shall pay the remaining principal sum of seventeen millionthree hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($17,375,000), plus interestat the rate of 9.38 percent per annum compounded on the unpaid balanceas of each scheduled payment interval, to the DOE in eight installmentsof principal and interest as follows, except as modified pursuant to paragraph404 or 405: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/>  <H1>Payment Number </H1><H1>Scheduled Payment </H1><H1>Scheduled interest </H1><H1>Scheduled Principal</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">1<D/>$4,189,000.00<D/>$679,072.92<D/>$3,509,927.08 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2<D/>2,875,000.00<D/>1,300,543.84<D/>1,574,456.16 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3<D/>2,000,000.00<D/>1,152,859.85<D/>847,140.15 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4 <D/>2,500,000.00 <D/>1,073,398.11 <D/>1,426,601.89 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5 <D/>2,500,000.00 <D/>939,582.85 <D/>1,560,417.15 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6 <D/>2,500,000.00 <D/>793,215.72 <D/>1,706,784.28 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7 <D/>3,775,976.17 <D/>633,119.35 <D/>3,142,856.82 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8 <D/>3,775,976.16 <D/>169,159.69 <D/>3,606,816.47</ITAG></ITAG>(a) Payment 1: The first scheduled payment shall be made five months afterthe payment date prescribed by paragraph 402 and shall be equal to thesum of three million five hundred nine thousand nine hundred twenty-sevendollars and eight cents ($3,509,927.08) principal plus interest of sixhundred seventy-nine thousand seventy-two dollars and ninety-two cents($679,072.92).

Such prepayment shall include interest at the rateof 9.38 percent per annum compounded on the unpaid balance as of the dateof such prepayment. Each such prepayment by Howell, as well as each prepaymentmade by Howell pursuant to the terms of paragraph 405, shall be creditedagainst Howell's next scheduled payment under paragraph 403, but only tothe extent thereof, and if the entire balance remaining payable after suchnext scheduled payment is less than the entire balance that would havebeen remaining after such next scheduled payment absent the prepayment,the remaining scheduled payments shall be reduced prorata to reflect suchdecrease. 405. Upon any sales, exchanges or other transfers of its property, plantand equipment, Howell's payment of the remaining balance owed to the DOEunder paragraphs 401 through 404 shall be accelerated in the followingmanner: Howell shall pay sixty percent (60%) of its total net cash receiptswhich total, in part or in the aggregate, in excess of one million fivehundered thousand dollars ($1,500,000) derived from any such transactionsoccurring within a calendar year to the DOE within thirty (30) days afterthe receipt thereof. Howell's payment to the DOE shall be accompanied bya copy of the closing statement pertaining to the transaction and a report,certified by a senior financial officer, reflecting the calculation ofgross cash receipts, net cash receipts and the portion thereof payableto the DOE. As used herein, ``net cash receipts'' means the total cashreceipts received by Howell on any sale, exchange or other transfer formore than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) less the sum of (1) twentypercent (20%) of such total cash receipts, which will be retained by Howellto provide for payment by Howell of Federal income taxes payable on thesale, exchange or other transfer, (2) the portion of such cash receipts,if any, required by Howell's current secured lender to retire current indebtednesspayable to such lender, (3) the portion of such cash receipts used to retireindebtedness the proceeds of which were used by Howell to satisfy previouspayment obligations to the DOE under paragraphs 402 and 403, (4) the portionof such cash receipts used to pay amounts owed DOE under this Consent Order,and (5) the portion of such cash receipts used to retire other indebtednessthe retirement of which has been approved in advance by DOE.

All pending and potential civil and administrative claims, whetheror not known, demands, liabilities, causes of action or other proceedingsby the DOE against Howell regarding Howell's compliance with an obligationsunder the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations during theperiod covered by this Consent Order, whether or not heretofore raisedby an issue letter, Notice of Probable Violation, Notice of Proposed Disallowance,Proposed Remedial Order, Remedial Order, action in court or otherwise,including DOE's claim against Howell as a joint venturer in the Quintana-HowellJoint Venture, are resolved and extinguished as to Howell by this ConsentOrder. 502. (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, compliance by Howell withthis Consent Order shall be deemed by the DOE to constitute full compliancefor administrative and civil purposes with all Federal petroleum priceand allocation regulations for matters covered by this Consent Order. Inconsideration for performance as required under this Consent Order by Howell,the DOE hereby releases Howell completely and for all purposes from alladministrative and civil judicial claims, demands, liabilities or causesof action, including without limitation claims for civil penalties, thatthe DOE has asserted or might otherwise be able to assert against Howellbefore or after the date of this Consent Order for alleged violations ofthe federal petroleum price and allocation regulations with respect tomatters covered by this Consent Order. The DOE will not initiate or prosecuteany such administrative or civil judicial matter against Howell or causeor refer any such matter to be initiated or prosecuted, nor will the DOEor its successors directly or indirectly aid in the initiations of anysuch administrative or civil judicial matter against Howell or participatevoluntarily in the prosecution of such actions. The DOE will not assertvoluntarily in any administrative or civil judicial proceeding that Howellhas violated the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations withrespect to the matters covered by this Consent Order or otherwise takeany action with respect to Howell in derogation of this Consent Order.However, nothing contained herein shall preclude the DOE from defendingthe validity of the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations.(b) The DOE will not seek or recommend any criminal fines or penaltiesbased on information or evidence presently in its possession for the matterscovered by this Consent Order, provided, however, that nothing in thisConsent Order precludes the DOE from (1) seeking or recommending such criminalfines or penalties if information subsequently coming to its attentionindicates, either by itself or in combination with information or evidencepresently known to DOE, that a criminal violation may have occurred or(2) otherwise complying with its obligations under law with regard to forwardinginformation of possible criminal violations of law to appropriate authorities.Nothing contained herein may be construed as a bar, estoppel, or defenseagainst any criminal or civil action brought by an agency of the UnitedStates other than the DOE under (i) section 210 of the Economic StabilizationAct of 1970 or (ii) any statute or regulation other than the Federal petroleumprice and allocation regulations. Finally, this Consent Order does notprejudice the rights of any third party or Howell in any private action,including an action for contribution by or against Howell.(c) Howell releases the DOE completely and for all purposes from all administrativeand judicial claims, liabilities, or causes of action that Howell has assertedor may otherwise be able to assert against the DOE relating to the DOE'sadministration of the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations.This release, however, does not preclude Howell from asserting any factualor legal position or argument as a defense to any action, claim, or proceedingbrought by the DOE, the United States, or any agency of the United States.Nor does it preclude Howell from asserting a defense, counterclaim or offsetto any action, claim or proceeding brought by any other person.(d) Howell hereby releases any and all claims that Howell may have forrefunds pursuant to any special refund procedures implemented pursuantto 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V. 503.
