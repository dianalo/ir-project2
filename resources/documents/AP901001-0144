Brennan was not on the bench to begin a newSupreme Court term Monday. But he was in the audience as his formercolleagues officially noted his departure.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist read an exchange of lettersbetween the eight court members and Brennan, its longtime leadingliberal.   ``The personal warmth which you radiate has enriched all of ourlives,'' Rehnquist read from the letter to Brennan. ``We will missyour wise counsel in our deliberations.''   Brennan's reply, also read by the chief justice, said, ``Myreluctance to retire from the court was sharpened by an awarenessthat I will no longer sit with each you on the bench or in theconferences.   ``I know that friendships forged in this court are sustained bymore than a common endeavor, and I therefore take comfort in theexpectation that our personal ties will endure in the yearsahead,'' Brennan wrote.   Brennan, 84, retired in July because of failing health. He useda cane to walk into the courtroom Monday and took a seat in asection reserved for special guests.   The seating arrangement of the other eight justices had beenchanged to reflect their changed seniority. On the far right end ofthe bench was an empty chair that will be filled soon by David H.Souter, after his anticipated confirmation by the Senate onTuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
