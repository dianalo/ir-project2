Under the revised plan, Lone Star Technologies will own80.5% of Lone Star Steel instead of 100%. A group includingAmroc Investments, which is affiliated with the Robert M.Bass Group, and Trust Co. of the West will receive cash for76% of their claims and 19.5% of the stock of Lone StarSteel.</LP><TEXT>   A Lone Star spokeswoman said that the dissident grouppurchased about $65 million to $70 million in Lone Star Steelbank debt after the bankruptcy filing, representing about 35%of the steel company's total debt. Because any reorganizationplan would have to be approved by holders of two-thirds ofthe company's debt, the group could have blocked the plan.   The previous plan had been agreed to in principle by thecreditors committee, but the spokeswoman said the dissidentgroup isn't represented on that committee.   The remaining unsecured creditors will receive 84 cents onthe dollar in cash for their claims. In addition, Lone StarTechnologies will contribute $40 million to the steel companyto allow it to make the required cash distributions. Thecreditors committee also agreed to drop litigation againstthe parent company.   Previously, Lone Star Steel planned to pay all creditors atotal of 85 cents on the dollar in cash, including some thatwould be paid over three years. Lone Star Technologies wouldhave contributed $44 million under that plan.   Lone Star said that creditors still must vote on the planand that confirmation hearings could take place in lateMarch.</TEXT></DOC>
