While these issues most directly affectHispanics, African-Americans and Asian-Americans, they alsowill greatly affect the general public once the counting isdone.   Major problems include undercounting of the Hispaniccommunity and other minority groups, an insufficient numberof Hispanic enumerators to go into those communities whereHispanics will be missed, and the lack of an outreach programby the U.S. Census Bureau. As a result, Hispanics and otherminorities will once again face an undercount. An undercountin the census means decreased political power and fewerfederal dollars going into communities across the country.</LP><TEXT>   Arturo Vargas   Director   National Census &quot;Make Yourself Count&quot; Program   Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund   Los Angeles   ---   I was fascinated by your observation in &quot;Census '90&quot; that&quot;computer whizzes have flourished in this statisticalhothouse.&quot; Exactly a century ago, inventor Herman Hollerithsaved the 1890 census from disaster and in doing so spawned arevolution in data processing. In 1880, the Census Office hadbeen overwhelmed. It took seven to eight years to producedetailed reports by largely manual methods. If nothing weredone by 1890, one census might overlap another and the wholeprocess fall into chaos. Fortunately, Hollerith'spunched-card tabulation system, developed for the 1890census, saved the day.   Employing the first practical data-processing system, theCensus Office completed tabulating most of the 1890 census inonly two to three years, although Hollerith's system was usedonly for the population portion of the job. For the firsttime, it had been possible to draw every possible combinationof data from the census schedules. And the machines saved theCensus Office $5 million in labor costs.   Hollerith's punched-card machines made quite a hit withindustry, too. By the time he sold his Tabulating Machine Co.in 1911, Hollerith's firm had about 100 commercial customers.His firm was merged with several others making butcherscales, time clocks and coffee grinders. In 1924, the newcompany changed its name to IBM.   Witnessing Hollerith's machines at work in the 1890census, journalist T.C. Martin noted, &quot;The apparatus works asunerringly as the mills of the Gods, but beats them hollow asto speed.&quot;   Geoffrey D. Austrian   Auburndale, Mass.</TEXT></DOC>
