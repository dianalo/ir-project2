<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-81-0210 </DOCNO><TEXT>Oxide high temperature superconductive material is attracting many researchers'attention. If this material is commercialized, former liquid helium willbe replaced by more popular liquid nitrogen which will greatly influencethe practical possibility of superconductivity. The effect will be considerableespecially in the superconductive magnet, magnetic levitation, or no-losspower distribution. This report describes on the nature of superconductivityand on the basis of electronic application. 1. Superconductive phenomenon(Perfect superconductivity, complete anti-magnetism, magnetic flux quantization,superconductive transition temperature, critical magnetic field, criticalcurrent). 2. Tunnel phenomenon (Electron tunneling, quasi-particle tuneling,electron-pair tunneling, tunnel-junction-type Josephson characteristics).3. SQUID (RF SQUID, DC SQUID) (10 figs, 8 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
