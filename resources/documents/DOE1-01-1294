Different forms and structures offer inherently differentpossibilities for conserving energy. This is particularly evident inthe transportation sector where the conjunction of population density,employment opportunity, transportation system, and service characteristicslargely determine the levels of savings that can be attained. Thus, theproblem confronting policy makers, interested in saving energy, mightbe seen as one of appropriately guiding development in the directionof various urban forms, or morphological states, offering further opportunitiesfor energy savings. This problem is complicated by the necessity of sustainingacceptable levels of social benefits. Furthermore, political pressureoften constrains policy-making within a relatively short time-frame,yielding immediate gains that do not maximize longer term benefits. Dataare developed, using a sequence of computer models, describing salientformal and performance characteristics of a number of theoretical urbanforms, or morphological structures. These data are further related withinan overall structure of transportation supply and demand (and the identifieddomains within the framework) within which maximum energy benefits areto be found. Estimations are then made of costs associated with movingfrom one morphological state to another.</TEXT></DOC>
