Responding to a recommendationfrom the Committee on Government Operations, the Office of Small and DisadvantagedBusiness Utilization has requested that the GSA's procedures for implementingsmall disadvantaged business involvement in the subcontracting programbe strengthened. The changes being made are intended to reinforce boththe subcontracting plan review process and the administration of thosesubcontracting plans to ensure full compliance with the statutory requirementsof Public Law 95-507.3. <T3>Effective date. </T3>December 2, 1988.4. <T3>Expiration date. </T3>This circular expires December 1, 1989, unlesscanceled earlier.5. <T3>Reference to regulation. </T3>Subpart 19.7 of the Federal AcquisitionRegulation and Subpart 519.7 of the General Services Administration AcquisitionRegulation.6. <T3>Explanation of changes.</T3>a. Section 519.701 is added to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">519.701</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>``Individual contract plan'' means a subcontracting plan that applies toa specific contract and that has goals which are based upon the company'splanned subcontracting and purchasing of supplies and services in supportof the performance of a specific contract, except that indirect costs incurredfor common or joint purposes may be allocated on a prorated basis to thecontract. Individual contract plans may incorporate a master subcontractingplan.``Commercial products plan'' means an annual subcontracting plan effectiveduring the offeror's fiscal year for all of the offeror's commercial products,and which has goals based on the offeror's production of both commercialand noncommerical products. This type of plan may apply to the productionof the offeror's entire company, or it may be limited to a division orplant.``Master subcontracting plan'' means a subcontracting plan which containsall of the required elements except goals, and which may be incorporatedinto an individual plan provided (a) the master plan has been approved,(b) the offeror provides a copy of the approved master plan and evidenceof its approval to the contracting officer and (c) goals and any deviationsfrom the master plan are approved by the contracting officer. Master subcontractingplans are useful for offerors who anticipate receiving many Governmentcontracts requiring individual subcontracting plans.b. Section 519.702 is added to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">519.702</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Statutory requirements.</ITAG>(a) The statute treats contracts and modifications separately, not cumulatively.Accordingly, if a subcontracting plan is not required at the time of awardbecause the value of the contract is below the threshold, a subcontractingplan will not be required if a subsequent modification increases the valueof the contract to an amount which exceeds the threshold, unless the valueof the modification itself exceeds $500,000, or $1 million for constructioncontracts.(b) It is not necessary to obtain another subcontracting plan for a modificationexceeding $500,000 ($1 million for construction contracts) if the contractalready includes a subcontracting plan. Modifications may be incorporatedinto an existing plan and the original plan goals revised to include thenew effort.c. Section 519.704 is added to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">519.704</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Subcontracting plan requirements.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Subcontracting goals. </T3>(1) Pursuant to section 211 of Public Law95-507, positive subcontracting goals for small and small disadvantagedbusiness concerns are required to establish a gauge for measuring results,and to provide an incentive for continuing efforts to increase the dollarvalue of contracts placed with small and small disadvantaged business concerns.(2) Although there may be no known small or small disadvantaged businessconcerns that furnish the products or services required by a prospectivecontractor at the time a subcontracting plan is developed, a zero goalis not acceptable because contractors are expected to make continuing effortsduring the contract period to locate and identify newly emerging smalland small disadvantaged business concerns as potential suppliers. In addition,there may be subcontracting opportunities in the area of indirect costs.(3) Goals in individual plans for multiyear contracts or contracts withoptions to extend the period of performance may be established for a periodless than the full term of the contract (including options) when it isimpractical to establish goals for the full term if the plan includes aschedule for establishing goals for the balance of the term of the contract.(b) <T3>Types of plans. </T3>For commercial products and public utility servicecontracts either a commercial products plan or an individual contract planmust be submitted. Individual contract plans must be submitted for othercontracts. (c) <T3>Duration of plans. </T3>(1) <T3>Individual plans. </T3>The plan must cover the entire period of contractperformance, including option periods (but see paragraph (a)(3), above,for goals). (2) <T3>Commercial products plans. </T3>A commercial products plan is approvedby the first Federal agency awarding a contract for commercial productsduring the contractor's fiscal year, and is applicable to every additionalFederal contract for commercial products awarded to that contractor duringthe contractor's same fiscal year. If the approved plan is limited to adivision or plant, it only applies to additional contracts for commercialproducts of that particular division or plant. The cutoff date for applyinga previously approved commercial products plan to additional Federal contractsis the end of the company's fiscal year in which the plan was approved.If the contract extends beyond the contractor's fiscal year, the GSA contractingofficer responsible for monitoring the existing plan, under 519.706-70(c),must request a new plan 30 days prior to the end of the contractor's fiscalyear. d. Section 519.705-2 is added to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">519.705-2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Determining the need for a subcontracting plan. </ITAG>Before making a determination, under FAR 19.705-2, that no subcontractingopportunities exist on a prospective contract which meets the dollar threshold,the contracting officer must contact the Director, Office of Small andDisadvantaged Business Utilization (AU), and consider any comments or recommendationsoffered. e. Section 519.705-4 is revised to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">519.705-4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Reviewing the subcontracting plan. </ITAG>(a) The GSA Form 3584, Checklist for Review of Subcontracting Plan, mustbe used by the procuring contracting officer (PCO) and small business technicaladvisor (SBTA) when reviewing subcontracting plans. Its use by SBA procurementcenter representatives is optional. (b) In the goals section of the plan, small disadvantaged business goalsare to be included in small business goals and stated separately. If itis not clear from the plan that the offeror has done this, the contractingofficer shall request clarification and have the offeror correct the goals,if necessary. (c) The contracting officer shall question low subcontracting goals submittedby an offeror required to submit a subcontracting plan and shall requirethe offeror to document in its plan the steps it has taken to identifysubcontracting opportunities for small and small disadvantaged businessconcerns. (d)(1) Before determining the responsibility of an offeror on a contractrequiring a subcontracting plan, the contracting officer shall review theofferor's compliance with previous subcontracting plans, if any, approvedby the contracting activity, including the contractor's performance insubmitting subcontracting reports in a timely manner. The findings mustbe documented on the GSA Form 3584, Checklist for Review of SubcontractingPlan, before forwarding it to the SBTA and the SBA/PCR for review. (2) In addition to paragraph (d)(1) above, PBS contracting officers mustcheck the quarterly list of PBS contracts with plans provided by AU andcontact all other contracting activities holding contracts with the samecontractor concerning compliance with the previous year's plan. (3) When an offeror has consistently failed to submit SF 294 and SF 295reports in a timely manner or has failed to make a good faith effort tomeet its subcontracting goals on previous contracts with plans, the contractingofficer shall include on the GSA Form 3584 the basis for finding the offerorresponsible including the steps the offeror proposes to take that werenot included in previous subcontracting plans to ensure compliance withthe subcontracting program requirements on the proposed contract. f. Section 519.705-5 is amended by redesignating paragraphs (a) and (b)as (c) and (d), respectively, and to substitute the verb ``must'' for ``should''in the second sentence of the redesignated paragraphs (c) and (d), andadding new paragraphs (a) and (b) to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">519.705-5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Awards involving subcontracting plans. </ITAG>(a) In the event there is an unresolved disagreement with the SBTA and/orSBA/PCR on a proposed subcontracting plan, the contracting officer, priorto making an award, must contact the Director (AU) and consider any commentsor recommendations offered. (b) When a contractor has a commercial products plan previously approvedby another GSA contracting activity or another Federal agency for the company'sfiscal year, the GSA contracting officer shall request a copy of the planand the agency approval document and include them in the contract file.The plan must also be included in and made a part of the resultant contract.g. Section 519.705-6 is revised to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">519.705-6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Postaward responsibilities of the contracting officer. </ITAG>(a) In addition to the requirements of FAR 19.705-6, contracting officersshall notify the SBTA of each contract award or contract modification exceeding$500,000 ($1 million for construction) that contains a subcontracting planwithin 5 work days of award.

(b) The subcontracting plan checklist (GSA Form 3584) must be submittedas the notice of award, except in the case of a contract incorporatinga previously approved commercial products plan. In this case, notice ofaward as described in paragraph (a) above, will be necessary as there willbe no subcontracting plan checklist. The SBTAs shall forward a copy ofnotices and checklists to AU on a weekly basis and retain a file copy.(c) AU will notify Congress of subcontracting goals established for eachcontract. h. Section 519.706-70 is revised to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">519.706-70 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Monitoring contractor compliance with subcontracting plans.</ITAG>(a) Contract administration may be performed by the procuring contractingofficer who awarded the contract or it may be delegated to an administrativecontracting officer (ACO). When contract administration is delegated, thesubcontracting plan must be included in the contract file transmitted tothe contract administration office. (b) The contracting officer administering contracts with subcontractingplans shall monitor receipt of SF 294 reports for individual contract plansand SF 295 reports for company-wide plans and review the reports for progressin meeting subcontracting plan goals by comparing the reports with theplan. If percentage goals are not met, the contractor must be requiredto explain the shortfall in the ``Remarks'' block on the subcontractingreports and may be required to submit evidence of their outreach effortsto locate and provide subcontracting opportunities to small business andsmall disadvantaged business concerns.

The contractingofficer responsible for monitoring receipt of the reports shall also obtaindelinquent SF 295 reports from contractors for both individual and company-wideplans upon request from AU. (c) In the case of commercial products plans approved by GSA, the firstcontracting officer who enters into a contract with a company during thecompany's fiscal year approves the plan and monitors receipt of reportsand compliance with the plan. This responsibility is generally assignedto the ACO if contract administration is delegated. Subsequent GSA contractsawarded during the company's same fiscal year and incorporating the previouslyapproved plan will not require submission of subcontracting reports. (d) In the case of commercial products plans approved by another agency,the first GSA contracting officer entering into a contract with the companyduring the company's same fiscal year in which the plan was approved requiresthe contractor to submit the SF 295 report and monitors receipt of thereport.
