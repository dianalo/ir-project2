'AIDS DISK' MAN ARRESTED IN THE U.S.andO;WILLOWICK, OHIO, U.S.A., 1990 FEB 03 (NB) -- Joseph Louis Popp, a 39-year-old anthropologist, has been arrested at his home in Willowick, Ohio, inconnection with the AIDS information disk mailed to more than 20,000 PC users- predominantly in Europe - late last year.andM;The arrest follows a behind-the-scenes investigation by four Scotland Yarddetectives, headed by Detective Inspector John Austen, who had been workinglong hours in pursuing the AIDS disk case.andP;  Sources suggest that furtherarrests are now quite likely.andM;As previously reported by Newsbytes, the AIDS disk was mailed out from Londonto at least 20,000 PC users in Mid-December last year.andP;  Preliminaryinvestigations revealed that a group of men had rented a post office box inPanama and in London in order to obtain mailing lists to post the disks outto unsuspecting PC users.andM;The disk invited users to load and run the AIDS information program, making apassing reference to what looked - at first glance - to be a complexshareware agreement.andP;  On closer inspection, the agreement committed the userto paying a license fee to PC Cyborg Corporation in Panama.andM;The AIDS program, meanwhile, encrypted and trashed the user's hard diskdirectory in such a way as to make the PC useless.andP;  Initially, industrysources had suggested that the disk was a thinly veiled extortion campaign,design to persuade panicked PC users to pay money to a post office box inPanama.andM;Popp's arrest, however, appears to have changed this thinking.andP;  Detectivesare now holding Popp with bond, pending a psychiatric evaluation.andP;  Accordingto the Associated Press, Popp is already receiving medication for a previousmental condition.andM;UK news sources now suggest that, when arrested, Popp was in the process ofpreparing for a mass mail-out of two million AIDS- style disks.andP;  If true,then the actions of the FBI and London's Scotland Yard computer crimedivision have almost certainly saved the computer industry several hundredmillion dollars worth of damage.andM;According to Guy Kewney, computer journalist and editor-in-chief of PCDealer, a UK computer trade newspaper, if the AIDS program case had takenplace just a few years ago, then it would have caused far more damage.andM;&quot;The thing that saved the day, and alerted the user community quickly to thecase was online computer conferencing.andP;

 The significance ofthis becomes especially apparent when you realize that a Cantonese speakercannot understand the speech of a Shanghainese, or a Pekingese that of anative of Szechuan.andP;  They all, however, share exactly the same writtenlanguage.andM;At least, that is true up to a point.andP;  Cantonese - the dialect of Hongkongand neighbouring Guangdong Province - in particular, has its own modernidioms not easily expressed in traditional written Chinese.andP;  In any case, ina attempt to facilitate literacy, the Chinese government has long been tryingto perfect a simplified system of characters.andP;  It requires a knowledge of atleast three thousand different traditional characters just to read thesimplest newspaper.andM;Other Asian nations also use characters based on Chinese -- the Korean andJapanese languages derived from Chinese, the Japanese have long been usingsimplified characters and Chinese is one of the official languages ofSingapore.andP;  Unfortunately, with the exception of some individual characters,Japanese, Chinese and Korean readers are not able to read each other'slanguages.andM;This is the background to the Hongkong Computer Society's (HKCS) drive toestablish international standards.andP;  Even without the confusion overdifferences in characters for the same word arising from the developmentsoutlined above, the widespread use of modern communications technology ishindered by a proliferation of systems for using Chinese characters incomputers.andM;The HKCS points out that internationally agreed standards are essential forthe input and internal processing of Chinese characters if such developmentsas EDI - Electronic Data Interchange - are to be accessible to Chinese users.andM;HKCS Chairman Richard Li says different countries and users in the region usedifferent expressions for the same technical terms.andP;  To prevent future chaos,some sort of international agreement must be reached.andM;The Society is inviting all interested countries to participate indiscussions and presentations on this issue at the Hongkong ComputerConference '90 scheduled for May.

 It disables many of the important components of the Macinterface, while it provides a product that is often entertaining andstimulating on line.andM;REVIEWandM;The Prodigy telecom service offers hundreds of interesting areas to explore,but requires the use of a special telecommunication program which haslimitations.andM;The Prodigy telecommunications software for the Mac is bug-ridden and counterto the Mac interface in many crucial ways.andP;  There is no support for deskaccessories, no support for FKeys, no support for any INITs such as thosethat provide separate menus like the spell- checkers or launch utilities likeOn Cue.andP;  There is no MultiFinder support.andP;  When you use Prodigy you can'taccess anything else on your computer by any means and you must return toFinder when you quit.andM;If you need a phone number or an address when you're on line with Prodigy,that's just too bad.andP;  You have to quit the service to find it or learn tolive without your computerized reference material.andP;  Nothing you have on diskis available to you when you're on line on Prodigy.andM;You can't pre-prepare messages for upload to Prodigy.andP;  You're forced to typeonline, and to interact online.andP;  When you are in the process of writingmessages as responses, you can not simultaneously view the message to whichyou're responding.andP;  There is no window support on Prodigy.andP;  This makesproviding a careful response to a complex message difficult.andP;  The only wayaround this, a cumbersome one, is to print the message to which you'reresponding, then read it as you write your response.andM;In many areas of Prodigy you can't print at all.andP;  You can never save to diskon Prodigy and you can often not print.andP;  You cannot print the columns,reviews, stories, games, and many over things you'd like to archive.andP;  As aresult, much of the information you are happy to find on Prodigy is lost.andO;I'm told there is a workaround by using GLUE to print to disk.andP;  I don't knowhow well it works, but requiring users to devise workarounds to save to diskis surely a poor way to run a telecommunication service.andM;There's no downloading from or uploading to Prodigy, so no file transfers canbe done.andM;One alluring concession to the Mac interface is that you can mouse throughthe menus on Prodigy, but this method of navigation online doesn't operate asefficiently as the keyboard commands.andP;  Via the keyboard, you can quickly TABthrough the menu fields, and then hit the RETURN or ENTER key to registeryour command.andP;  The Prodigy software responds so much more sluggishly to mousecommands, that many opt to use the keyboard instead.andP;  Nevertheless, there isan interactive quality to Prodigy represented by this feature and it issignificant.andP;  Many areas on Prodigy are genuinely interactive and theseareas, along with the stunning color graphics, are a lot of fun.andM;Prodigy is pretty to look at, especially in color, but Prodigy software won'twork in color on the Mac IIci.andM;Prodigy is supposed to be a service for shopping, but I found it easy toignore the ads for the most part and I've bought only postage stamps throughProdigy so far.andP;  Will they revoke my membership? Probably not.andM;The most important advantage of Prodigy is that it's a cheap way to introduceyour family to telecommunications.andP;  Up to five family members may share thesame ID number (with just a letter suffix to distinguish between themembers).andP;  Children can log on and can play games on Prodigy to their hearts'content.andP;  In addition, they can learn the basics of how to post messages, andfind their way around a telecommunications system.andP;  This is a great bargainfor only $10 a month, given that all other national and internationalservices charge for each minute of online time.andM;Experts are paid to write regular, brief, columns and as part of their job,maintain a presence on the bulletin board areas.andP;  The Mac expert is SteveRosenthal, who provides three, often informative, weekly columns.andP;  Sadly,when you find some good information in one of his columns, you can't save itto disk and you can't print it out.andP;  You are reduced to scribbling on a pieceof paper.andM;When I joined Prodigy I saw that multitudes of complaints about the softwarewere directed to Steve Rosenthal (because of his Expert status) in the MacSoftware area.andP;  Steve was not permitted to respond to questions about theProdigy service or software.andP;  He was required to direct all such inquiries toa special support area.andP;  My perusal of that area revealed apparent chaos.andO;Hundreds of complaints and only a fraction seemed to result in responses.andO;The Prodigy management did try to provide informative responses, but therewas such a flood of questions at the time I looked at it, they couldn't keepup.andM;Some of the special areas are innovative.andP;  There was a wonderfully awfulscience fiction novel online with 50 daily installments.andP;  Many people orderhome-delivered groceries via Prodigy.andM;The forum areas contain more than the official experts.andP;  The subscribers areof a high quality and the level of discussion is often stimulating.andP;  You canprint posted messages in the forums, even though you can't save them to disk.andO;The level of discussion and help with regard to the Mac, writing, sci fi,movies (those are the areas I've used) is probably equivalent to that on anyof the national telecom services.andM;But the software interface on the message bases is slow and awkward, eventhough there are some powerful aspects to it as well.andP;  You can preselectmessages to be read by date, and can include the original message to whichthere may be responses.andP;  Since you can't read backward on the service to geta prior messages, the retrieval structure itself has some uniquely positiveaspects.andP;  But you need a fast Mac and a fast modem to not be totally boggeddown in molasses when you're reading the message bases.andP;  The speed of theProdigy service is acceptable on a Mac with an 030 processor, lots of RAM,and a 2400 baud modem.andP;  For an experienced telecommunicator, it's just tooslow on a Mac Plus or at 1200 baud.andP;  But the speed isn't as important topeople who are new to telecommunications, so for beginners, Prodigy is agreat place to practice, and a great place to hang out.andM;Features are available there that are very costly on other services, such asairline info, booking and stock market quotes.andM;One aspect that inhibits a free-flow of discussion on Prodigy is that allpublic messages are read by Prodigy staff before posting, are held up formany hours and then posted in bulk.andP;  During this review process, manymessages are rejected for public posting.andP;  They are returned to sender viaprivate mail, with a cover letter that doesn't explain which rule has beenbroken.andP;  The rules for acceptable public posting are not intuitively obvious,even to the experienced telecommunicator.andP;  As a result, newcomers are oftenbewildered and insulted by the &quot;censorship.&quot; Nevertheless, I haven't seencensorship on Prodigy in the way I've seen it on some services.andP;  Anti-Prodigymessages are posted and so are messages favorable to other telecom services.andO;Messages of that kind are sometimes censored on other services.andP;  What iscensored? Things like &quot;thank you&quot; messages, advertisements, and messages thatapparently don't pertain to the topic of the area.andP;  There is no method ofappeal, but you can rewrite your message and try posting it again.andM;One problem with the Prodigy censorship is that it's so frequent and soapparent.andP;  Censorship takes place on most telecommunication services.andP;  Sysopswill either delete a message that they deem inappropriate or will move it tothe private sysops section that exists in every forum on some services, orwill even quietly exclude a member from the forum or from the service.andM;Sometimes this is done properly and sometimes improperly, but almost alwaysquietly, secretly, and infrequently.andP;  I've sometimes seen sysops elsewherepost a message saying they're removing a message, giving the reason for thecensorship in an effort to head off public complaints about the missingmessage.andP;  On Prodigy, with many messages being censored daily, rarely forgood reasons from the public's point of view, and never with explanation, theaction creates suspicion, dissatisfaction, and irritation in the membership.andM;I've used Prodigy successfully for the private mail capacity.andP;  These messagesare posted immediately (not held up for review), and you can write yourfriends essentially for free at $10/ month.andP;  But again, there aredisadvantages.andP;  Email (private) messages are limited to 4 pages in length,and given the gigantic typeface Prodigy uses, that's not a very long message.andO;No aspect of the messages can be cut, copied, pasted, or saved to disk.andP;  Yes,you can print them.andP;  I'm someone who characteristically archives a lot ofinformation to disk so the inability to do this on Prodigy is a severedrawback for me.andP;  Most people won't suffer as much as I do by thislimitation.andM;I intend to continue to use the service in limited ways, but I'm hoping therewill be some significant improvements in the Mac software in the nextrelease.andP;  Rumors have it that will occur in April/May, but I have noinformation as to what's being planned for the new version.andM;PUMA RATINGSandM;PERFORMANCE: 1.5.andP;  There is lack of support for desk accessories, FKeys,INITs, windows, lack of support for utilities that provide additional menus,inability to cut, copy, paste, inability to save to disk, and inability toprint in many key areas of the service.andP;  There is no MultiFinder support, andyou must use special software.andP;  On the other hand, it's pretty, colorful, andfun.andM;USEFULNESS: 2.5.andP;  The inability to capture to disk, upload, download, andprint from some areas of the service, inhibits the usefulness.andP;  Yet, forquick, casual, communication, it's great, and there are dozens of onlineareas with important information.andM;MANUAL: 2.5.andP;  Not much supplied.andM;AVAILABILITY: 3.5.andP;  You can probably buy the software in your supermarket.andO;It seems to be available everywhere.andP;  Support seemed somewhat overwhelmedwhen I checked it, but were doing a good job.andM;(Linda Joan Kaplan/19900128) @NEW02030098 /andamp; Review of: Star Wars, game forthe MacintoshandM;Runs on: MacintoshandM;From: Broderbund, 17 Paul Drive, San Rafael, CA 94903andM;Price: US $24andM;PUMA rating: 3 (on a scale of 1=lowest to 4=highest)andM;Reviewed for Newsbytes by: Naor Wallach, 2/1/90andM;Summary: A simple shoot-em-up game that follows the final scenes from themovie Star Wars.andM;REVIEWandM;In Star Wars you get to try and play as Luke Skywalker in those finalmemorable scenes from the Star Wars movie.andP;  You pilot a fighter in battlesagainst the empire's tie fighters (and Darth Vader!), destroy fortificationsalong the surface of the Death Star, and finally, fight your way through thearmed trench with the goal of dropping your bombs down the chute that willcause the Death Star to blow up.andP;  Should you succeed, you get to try and doit over again with more and better adversaries.andM;Controlling the game is very simple.andP;  You do not need to steer your craft orperform any other function than aim your laser guns and fire.andP;  This is donequite effectively with the mouse.andP;  In the middle of your screen appear foursmall triangles whose apexes denote the point at which your laser guns aim.andO;Moving the mouse moves these triangles.andP;  Pressing the mouse button fires theguns.andP;  That's all there is to it.andM;There are three scenes (or combat zones) in the game.andP;  The first is theapproach to the Death Star.andP;  In this scene you fly your craft towards theDeath Star while Imperial tie fighters come from behind you and engage you ina fight.andP;  If you manage to hit them, you are awarded a thousand points.andO;Should they get a shot off at you, you may hit those and receive 33 pointsfor hitting them and as a bonus, they do not affect you in any way.andM;Occasionally, you will encounter Darth Vader out there.andP;  His fighter isshaped differently and does not fall apart when you hit it.andP;  Instead, you geta 2000 point bonus and the chance to shoot at him again.andM;Eventually, you work your way through the screen of tie fighters and areplaced on the surface of the Death Star.andP;  Here, you must navigate along thesurface and shoot enemy fortification towers that are placed randomly on thesurface.andP;  Needless to say, these towers shoot back.andP;  At higher levels, youare presented with more towers and some that cannot be destroyed and that youshould not crash into either.andM;After shooting your way through a bunch of these towers, you are finallyplaced in the trench.andP;  Here you hurtle along it and attempt to shoot thesefire balls that appear form nowhere and are aimed at you.andP;  Hit one and itdisintegrates.andP;  If one hits you, you lose one of your shields.andP;  At the end ofthe trench appears the target hole.andP;  You must aim at it and shoot it.andP;  Thistime, you will see two bombs go down in addition to your Laser Gun fire.andP;  Ifsuccessful, you will be whisked out of range of the exploding Death Star andwill be treated to a display of its blowing up.andP;  Then, a bonus may be earnedand new shield added and you are off again to try and destroy it again.andM;The idea behind the game is a simple shoot-em-up and once you destroy theDeath Star you are simply awarded the opportunity to try it again.andP;  You areprotected by nine shields that get destroyed one by one as fire balls,towers, and other stuff hits your ship.andP;  Once you lose all your shields, thenext object to hit you causes the game to end.andP;  Like most arcade style games,there is a high score screen that allows you to enter your initials next toyour score where they will be saved.andM;The graphics seem crude in this day and age.andP;  All the objects are depicted aswire-frame drawings so that you can see right through them.andP;  Although therenditions of the tie fighters and Darth Vader's ship are accurate to themovie version, it still is disconcerting to have a big tie fighter in yourview and see, through its body!, the Death Star and other stars beyond it.andO;The explosions sequence is a very primitive collection of circles drawnaround the Death Start with a teeny bang to accompany it.andP;  This is especiallydisappointing as throughout the game are interspersed digitized sound clipsfrom the movie itself.andP;  I almost jumped out of my chair the first time thatObi-Wan-Kenobee addressed me and told me to trust in the force!andM;Star Wars is copy protected via the key disk routine in which you must havethe original floppy inserted into a disk drive to get the program to load.andO;Although once that's done, you can play off of your hard disk with noproblems.andP;  There is a one page poster/manual that covers what you need toknow (which ain't much!) and gets you going.andM;PUMA RATINGSandM;PERFORMANCE: 3.andP;  The game moves along.andP;  Although on a Mac with a colorscreen, I would recommend going into the Control Panel and changing yourmonitor to display in black and white only to speed up the action.andP;  All thegraphics are in Black and White anyway.andM;USEFULNESS:  3.andP;  As a shoot-em-up game it is relatively entertaining,although boredom did set in quite quickly.andM;MANUAL:  2.andP;  The one page poster/manual is adequate but could be written in aless confusing manner.andM;AVAILABILITY: 4.andP;  Available from mail order and software stores.andM;(Naor Wallach/19900123) @NEW02030099 /andamp;

SOFTWARE PIRACY: MORE THAN ONE VIEW -Editorial by N. Wingrove CAUSEWAY BAY, HONGKONG, 1990 JAN 30 (NB) -- Softwarepiracy has long been a hot topic and never more so than in Hongkong.andP;  Perhapsthat statement should be widened somewhat to cover much of the Far East.andP;  Thetrue capital of computer piracy for the last decade and more has been Taiwan,but to people all over the world mere mention of piracy in relation tosoftware means one particular building.andM;The Golden Shopping Centre in Shamshiupo is not very large.andP;  It is a rathernondescript building in an modest suburb incorporating a cinema in one cornerand a basement, ground floor and one other story of shopping arcades, most ofthem dedicated to computers and associated hardware, software and manuals.andO;These days most of the shops display and sell genuine goods, but many arestill able to supply illicit copies from a backroom or a nearby storeroom.andM;Repeated raids by the Customs and Excise Department, largely instigated by USsoftware houses, and subsequent prosecutions have put some operators out ofbusiness and forced others to assume at least an appearance ofrespectability.andP;  But in the process a great deal of resentment has beencreated among perfectly legitimate computer users.andM;Perhaps the most powerful local argument against the Customs raids is thattaxpayers' money is being squandered to protect the private interests of ahandful of US companies.andP;  There is a continuing public debate throughnewspaper correspondence columns on the rights and wrongs of piracy.andP;  Theindustry insists that its rights are being infringed and that it is losingmillions of Hongkong dollars to the pirates.andP;  The customers, who have next tono consumer protection in Hongkong, reply that they only buy pirate softwareto provide themselves with the services not supplied locally by thecompanies.andP;  They point out that they have to pay much higher prices forsoftware than the US full list price, yet there are no facilities for them tocheck out programs for suitability to their needs and, if they do eventuallybuy, they are given no backup support.andP;  The pirates are seen to fulfill atleast one of the potential buyer's needs.andP;  You can buy a pirated program andmanual, try the package out and if it doesn't come up to scratch, ditch it.andO;On the other hand, many people have bought the genuine article after findingit did satisfy their needs.andM;This process is particularly important outside the US.andP;  All too many programsignore the fact that there is a big wide world outside the narrow confines ofthe USA.andP;  Software which is excellent in principle may totally ignore thereality that not everybody uses the US dollar, or that US dollar data fieldsare too short to hold the data.andP;  Think of the Japanese yen, the Italian lira,the Thai Baht or even the Hongkong dollar at 7.8:1 against its UScounterpart.andP;  A person buying a package that does not cater to his currencyrequirements would end up wasting money on a useless purchase.andM;There are many Australian and European software packages now available thatdo recognize the need for flexibility in such matters as currency fields.andO;Many of them are equal to or better than their American counterparts and areinvariably only a fraction of the price.andP;  Interestingly, it is rare to seepirated versions of any of these on sale at Golden Shopping Centre.andM;Some US word processing programs still ignore the fact that American spellingis not universal.andP;  A dictionary is useless unless it speaks your language.andO;In all too many cases the only way a buyer can find out if a WP packageprovides an English English dictionary is to buy it, or a pirated copy.andO;Frequently an English dictionary is available - but only as an optionalextra.andP;  Who can blame the customer for shopping elsewhere - assuming hehasn't already spent his hard-earned money on a program that can't check hisspelling properly because he didn't have the sense to try out an illicit copyfirst?andM;What it all comes down to is arrogance on the part of all too many softwarepublishers.andP;  They fail to provide their potential customers with theinformation and backup needed to make viable an investment in their software,and then complain when those customers try to check matters out forthemselves.andM;All this leaves out the question of students.andP;  Until now there has beenalmost no attempt by the major software publishers to address the needs ofHongkong students.andP;  Schools, colleges and the students themselves invariablyhave to pay the full price for software and abide by all the finer licencingconditions - or buy a $4 pirate copy.andP;  There are at last signs that thecompanies are coming to their senses and making special arrangements foreducational institutions and their students.andP;  In the meantime, thousands ofstudents have bought pirated software, learned from it, evaluated it andeither thrown it away or proselytised on its behalf when they have graduatedand gone into business.andM;This process is not confined to students, however.andP;  Many real users havestarted off with pirated copies for the reasons mentioned earlier.andP;  No onewhose livelihood or business depends on the reliability of computer softwareentrusts it in the long run to a pirate copy.andP;  That may be alright as long asthe program works.andP;  But what happens when it crashes? On the other hand, whoin his right senses would spend several hundred or even thousands of dollarson an untried product for which no demonstration facilities are available?andM;Hongkong is fairly typical of the Far East.andP;  When buying software, you are onyour own.andP;  Chances are the dealer has no stock of the program you want.andP;  Hewill order it for you, at a cost far higher than the full US list price andwith a delivery time, if you are lucky, of a month.andP;  Once it has arrived, ifanything goes wrong, your only recourse is to spend money on an internationalphone call to the US publisher.andP;  In the meantime, your business languishes.andO;Then, when a later version comes out, you are foolish enough to expect to beable to take advantage of the publisher's upgrade offer.andP;  You go to the localdealer.andP;  &quot;Yes we can upgrade this for you.andP;  You must return the originaldiscs and manuals and we will get  the new version for you sometime.&quot; This isno exaggeration.andP;  One prominent Hongkong businessman went through this a yearago with a famous product.andP;  At the local distributor he ran into a brickwall.andP;  Eventually from pure frustration he contacted the US principal via TheSource.andP;  In no time at all, the latest version was on its way to him,together with other, complimentary, software.andP;  The Hongkong distributor wasquickly replaced by a competitor.andP;  Two weeks ago the same man had a similarexperience with another company's product.andP;  In this case, he was quoted aprice for an upgrade which was considerably more expensive than the normalretail price for the original product, already far above the US price.andP;  Thepresent writer recently tried to upgrade a programming package.andP;  The originaldiscs had to be returned.andP;  A delivery time of three weeks was quoted.andP;  Morethan six weeks later it had to be chased up.andP;  When it did arrive, it lackedthe essential manuals.andP;  After another month of fruitless waiting, a messagevia Genie to Borland International brought an immediate and generousresponse.andM;The following is a message on the HongKong Computer Society's BBS from abusinessman to the author on a similar occurrence.andP;  Quote: &quot;I agreecompletely, I wrote to XXXX XXXXXXX to upgrade from Turbo C 1.5 to Ver.andP;  2.0Professional.andP;  They replied that I would have to send manual and disks backto them at Singapore then pay exorbitant freight charges for shipping theupgrade.andP;  I thought that this was a load of nonsense and wrote directly toBorland in the States.andP;  Within 10 days I received the software (completepackage - assembler/compiler/debugger) charged to my Visa card.andP;  The savingson doing it this way was US$55- on the price quoted by XXXX XXXXXXX.andP;  Borlandhas my vote every time for good support.andP;  As for local dealers, I just don'twant to know.andP;  If I get bad service from a company in the States there areplenty of magazines to write complaining letters to, here nobody cares, it isdefinitely a case of &quot;caveat emptor!&quot;andM;Borland International, needless to add, is not among the companies creatingsuch a fuss because their overpriced products are being pirated.andP;  If thesoftware industry really wishes to put the pirates out of business, the onusis on them to make their wares affordable; to ensure that, wherever in theworld they are sold, there are adequate demonstration facilities and thatbuyers are assured of fast and efficient locally based support and upgradefacilities.andP;  Support need not be free of charge.andP;  If an expensive productdoes the job for which it was bought, a justly priced support contract wouldnot be rejected by any reasonable customer.andP;  But to expect anyone to committheir money to an untried product at an artificially-high price and with noguarantee of help when things go wrong is to ensure a long life for thepirates.andM;The fact is that the &quot;Pirates&quot; have provided an invaluable service, not onlyto computer users, but to the industry, too.andP;  They have stepped into thebreach when the industry has ignored its responsibilities.andP;  They have helpedsome purchasers avoid unsuitable software and they have introduced manyothers to products which they have eventually bought through legitimatechannels.andP;  Most important of all, they have helped meet the needs of thestudents who will be tomorrow's decision makers but who have been all butignored by the industry mandarins.andM;Finally, those extravagant claims by some sectors of the industry about thoselost millions.andP;  The truth, Gentlemen, is that most of the people buying thosepirated copies bought them to learn, did not want them for real business use,could not have afforded the genuine articles and would never have boughtthem, even if they could afford then, having tried the pirated versions.andM;(Norman Wingrove/11900203) @NEW02030102 /andamp; ALDUS TO INTRODUCE PAGEMAKER 4.0ON TUESDAY} SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, U.S.A., 1990 FEB 1 (NB) -- Aldus,manufacturer of the show-case DTP product for both PCs and Macs will show thelatest version 4.0 next Tuesday the 6th at functions around the world.andM;Newsbytes was unable to determine if the launch will be for the PC version,as sources only spoke of the Macintosh version being demonstrated.andM;The new product will include word processing, new typographic control and theability to handle long documents.andP;  In addition, color handling has beenupgraded.andM;When version 3.0 was released, Aldus took the opportunity to bring Mac and PCproducts into line.andP;  What is known is that the company has been working on adevelopment framework 'Vamp' which will allow products to be made portablebetween the two environments and will also allow additional modules to beadded later, either by Aldus or third parties.andM;It's not expected that version 4.0 will have full implementation of Vamp orthat third party developers will be invited to participate.andP;  Anticipatedtypes of add-ins include graphics generators and editors, text processors andeven expert system modules for semi-automated DTP production.andP;  Observers alsobelieve that Aldus will introduce a macro language for Pagemaker, and theWindows version will have dynamic data linking (DDL) enabling it to interactwith applications such as Microsoft Word for Windows and Excel, as well asproducts to be launched over the coming year.andM;(Paul Zucker/19900201)</TEXT></DOC>
