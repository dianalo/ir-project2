The reaction of 1 with KOC(CH{sub3}){sub 3} gave the neutral {mu}-carbene complex [(C{sub 5}H{sub 5})(CO)Fe]{sub2}({mu}-CO)({mu}-CHOC(CH{sub 3})P{sub 3}] (4). Reaction of 1 with waterafforded a 1:1 mixture of {mu}methylene complex [(C{sub 5}H{sub 5})(CO)Fe]{sub2}({mu}-CO)({mu}-CH{sub 2}) (2) and [(C{sub 5}H{sub 5})(CO)Fe]{sub 2}({mu}-CO){sub2}; these products are proposed to arise from disproportionation of aninitially formed hydroxy carbene species. Reaction of 1 with Et{sub 4}N{sup+}Br{sup -} gave the unstable {sup +}-carbene complex [(C{sub 5}H{sub5})(CO)Fe]{sub 2}({mu}-CO)({mu}-CHBr) (6). Reaction of 1 with the carbonnucleophiles CH{sub 3}Li and Li(C{sub 6}H{sub 5}CuCN) gave the {mu}-carbenecomplexes [(C{sub 5}H{sub 5})(CO)Fe{sub 2}({mu}-CO)({mu}-CHCH{sub 3})(11) and [(C{sub 5}H{sub 5})(CO)Fe]{sub 2}({mu}-CO)({mu}-CHC{sub 6}H{sub5} (12), while reaction of 1 with HFe(CO){sub 4}{sup -} afforded 2. 1reacted with acetone via nucleophilic addition of the enol affordingthe neutral {mu}-carbene complex [C{sub 5}H{sub 5})-(CO)Fe]{sub 2}({mu}-CO)({mu}-CHCH{sub2}COCH{sub 3})] (13). 1 also reacted with cyclohexanone, 2-butanone,4-methyl-2-pentanone, 2,4-pentanedione, 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione,ethyl acetoacetate, and the sodium salt of diethyl malonate to give similar{mu}-carbene products.</TEXT></DOC>
