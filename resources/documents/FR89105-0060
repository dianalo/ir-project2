The license provides, among other things, thatit is subject to all rules, regulations, and Orders of the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission (the Commission or NRC) now or hereafter in effect. The facilityconsists of a boiling-water reactor located at the licensee's site in Plymouth,Massachusetts. The facility is currently shut down for refueling and modifications.Section 50.54(q) of 10 CFR Part 50 requires a licensee authorized to operatea nuclear power reactor to follow and maintain in effect emergency plansthat meet the standards of 10 CFR 50.47(b) and the requirements of AppendixE to 10 CFR Part 50. Section IV.F.3 of Appendix E requires that each licenseeat each site shall exercise with offsite authorities such that the Stateand local government emergency plans for each operating reactor site areexercised biennially, with full or partial participation by State and localgovernments, within the plume exposure pathway emergency planning zone(EPZ).The NRC may grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations which,pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), are (1) authorized by law, will not presentan undue risk to the public health and safety, and are consistent withthe common defense and security; and (2) present special circumstances.Section 50.12(a)(2)(v) of 10 CFR indicates that special circumstances existwhen an exemption would provide only temporary relief from the applicableregulation and the licensee has made good faith efforts to comply withthe regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">II</ITAG>By letter dated September 17, 1987, the licensee requested a one-time exemptionfrom the schedule requirements of Section IV.F.3 of Appendix E. The lastbiennial emergency preparedness exercise was a full-participation exerciseconducted at the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station on September 5, 1985. Thelicensee requested that an exemption be granted to allow the next biennialexercise to be deferred from 1987 to the second quarter of 1988.The licensee stated that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the local governmentswithin the EPZ, and the two emergency reception center communities werein the process, with the assistance of the licensee, of implementing numerousimprovements in their offsite emergency preparedness programs. These improvementsincluded revision of the emergency plans of the local governments and theCommonwealth, the development of associated procedures, the developmentand implementation of training programs for officials and emergency personnel,and the upgrading of Emergency Operations Centers. The licensee expectedthe work to continue through early 1988. The licensee informed the NRCthat, in view of the extensive ongoing efforts, the Commonwealth and thelocal governments indicated that they were not able to fully participatein an exercise during calendar year 1987.On December 16, 1987, the Commission published a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice approving the exemption, stipulating thatthe exercise be conducted before June 30, 1988. By letter dated April 14,1988, the licensee requested an extension of the June 30, 1988, exemptiondeadline to permit conduct of the exercise before the end of 1988. Thelicensee stated that, although substantial progress had been made to improveemergency preparedness since the original exemption request, the extensiveemergency planning efforts had taken longer than anticipated. The licenseerequested an extension of the exemption for the same special circumstancesas existed at the time of the original exemption request. On May 18, 1988,the Commission published a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice approving the exemption, stipulating thatthe exercise be conducted before the end of 1988.By letter dated December 8, 1988, Boston Edison requested an additionalextension of the exemption. Boston Edison stated that since the previousextension was granted, substantial additional planning progress had beenmade, including the submission to the Federal Emergency Management Agency(FEMA) for informal technical review the draft plans, the implementingprocedures, and associated supporting documentation for five of the sevenEPZ and reception center communities; the submission to FEMA of the draftMassachusetts Civil Defense Agency (MCDA) Area-II plan for review; thecompletion of most of the renovation work for the town Emergency OperationsCenters; and the completion of a new set of evacuation time estimates.Boston Edison further stated that efforts are now under way, with the approvalof the Commonwealth, to prepare for the conduct of a full-participationoffsite exercise.Boston Edison indicated that the scheduling of both pre-exercise drillsand the exercise itself could now be undertaken; however, the Commonwealth,as stated in a letter to the licensee from the Director of the MCDA datedNovember 21, 1988, believes that ``it is inappropriate to discuss an exercisedrill schedule at this time.'' The licensee further indicated that theCommonwealth has agreed to participate in discussions regarding the exerciseobjectives and scenario but believes that an exercise should not be helduntil the planning process is completed. As the Commonwealth's participationin pre-exercise drills and its acceptance of the proposed objectives andscenario are exercise prerequisites, Boston Edison requested an extensionof the exercise exemption until 120 days after the completion of the powerascension program.Boston Edison advances several reasons why the requested extension is appropriate.First, the power ascension program represents a highly controlled testingregimen during which NRC pesonnel will maintain an increased monitoringpresence at the plant. Second, extension of the exemption until severalmonths after the completion of the power ascension program will enablelicensee personnel to devote full attention to the power ascension programand permit such emergency preparedness exercise activities as the conductof a ``dry run'' to take place after the power ascension program is complete.Finally, the requested extension provides an opportunity for the completionof those planning tasks deemed to be exercise prerequisites by the Commonwealth.<ITAG tagnum="84">III</ITAG>Onsite emergency preparedness has continued to be evaluated by the NRCduring inspections and exercises, including the most recent onsite exerciseconducted on December 13, 1988. The 1988 exercise included notificationof the Commonwealth and local town response organizations via the recentlyinstalled Digital Notification Network. The NRC staff's preliminary evaluationof the 1988 exercise indicates that no emergency preparedness weaknesseswere identified and Boston Edison's emergency response actions were adequateto provide protective measures for the health and safety of the public.The NRC inspection findings and the licensee's exercise performance provideassurance that the licensee has maintained a satisfactory capability torespond to an emergency at Pilgrim. Since the last full-participation biennial exercise at Pilgrim (in September1985), the Commonwealth has participated on a limited basis with the licenseein the annual onsite exercises conducted in 1986, 1987, and 1988. The townswithin the EPZ have also cooperated in the full-scale siren test conductedby FEMA in September 1986 and again on December 7, 1988. The Commonwealthhas also participated in full-participation exercises at the Yankee-RoweNuclear Power Station in April 1988 and at the Vermont Yankee Nuclear PowerStation in December 1987, and in a partial-participation exercise at VermontYankee in August 1988. The exercises demonstrate the Commonwealth's abilityto exercise command and control, to interface with other agencies, andto assess and respond to conditions requiring actions to protect the healthand safety of the public.The requested exemption extension is necessary because ongoing emergencypreparedness efforts will not be completed for several months. The licenseehas made a good faith effort to comply with the regulation by assistingin the ongoing improvements to the Commonwealth and local offsite emergencyresponse programs. The licensee has expended approximately ten milliondollars and expects to spend five million dollars more to improve the offsiteresponse programs. The Commonwealth, whose participation is essential,has stated that it is not prepared to participate in an exercise untilthe planning process is completed. The exemption is only for a temporaryperiod until the planning approval process is sufficiently complete topermit the Commonwealth to participate. The Commonwealth has not statedwhen it expects to be ready to participate in an exercise; however, thelicensee's request for an exercise to be conducted within 120 days aftercompletion of the power ascension program (which is expected to take 4-5months) appears to be a reasonable time estimate. This situation constitutesspecial circumstances as described in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v).In granting the original exemption, the NRC stated its belief that thepublic health and safety would be better served by the conduct of a full-participationexercise following the completion of efforts to improve the Commonwealthand local government emergency response programs. That rationale is stillappropriate, and the staff believes that the required exercise should becarried out at such time as the Commonwealth is prepared to participate.The staff recommended that the Commission approve restart of the Pilgrimplant, and this approval was granted by the Commission on December 21,1988. In its discussion with the Commission, the staff informed the Commissionthat it has reasonable assurance that adequate protective measures canand will be taken in the event of a radiological emergency and that therealso was reasonable assurance that the plant could resume operations withoutundue risk to public health and safety. The following considerations formthe basis for these conclusions:a. There have been a number of significant improvements in facility hardwareand a significant improvement in the focus of Boston Edison managementon safety issues so that the facility is substantially safer today thanit was before it was shut down in April 1986.b. The emergency planning problems pointed out by FEMA in August 1987 relatedto certain planning deficiencies rather than to exercise performance. TheNRC staff has concluded that the emergency planning deficiencies identifiedby FEMA have been sufficiently resolved, based on the Staff's review andobservations of the current status of the improvements in emergency plansand procedures. There has been general agreement that overall emergencyplanning for the Pilgrim facility has been substantially upgraded, eventhough various procedures have not yet been completed.c. The licensee's capability to respond in an emergency has been demonstratedin full-participation exercises conducted in 1982, 1983, and 1985, andin annual onsite exercises conducted in 1986, 1987, and 1988.d. The Commonwealth's capability to respond in a nuclear power plant emergencyhas been recently tested during full-participation exercises at the Yankee-Rowefacility in April 1988 and at the Vermont Yankee facility in December 1987,and during a partial-participation exercise at Vermont Yankee in August1988.e. The capability of the local response organizations was satisfactorilydemonstrated in the full-participation exercises conducted in 1982, 1983,and 1985, and the infrastructure to respond to emergencies which was demonstratedin these exercises is still largely in place. In addition, the emergencyplanning improvements at Pilgrim are, by and large, the result of verysignificant efforts by the local emergency response personnel who are responsiblefor implementing such plans and procedures in the event of an emergency.These personnel are thoroughly familiar with the improved plans and, althoughimproved emergency response training is still under way, sufficient traininghas taken placed to assure that emergency response personnel will performadequately in the event of an emergency.The staff, therefore, has determined that there is reasonable assurancethat adequate protective action can and will be taken in the event of aradiological emergency at the Pilgrim plant even considering the lack ofa recent full-participation exercise. Furthermore, the status of emergencypreparedness is expected to continue to improve as the Commonwealth ofMassachusetts and local officials continue to improve the plans in preparationfor a full-participation exercise.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV</ITAG>For these reasons, the Commission has thus determined that, pursuant to10 CFR 50.12, the Exemption extension requested by the licensee's letterof December 8, 1988, as previously discussed, is authorized by law, willnot present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistentwith the common defense security.Accordingly, the Commission hereby approves the following Exemption:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station is exempt from the requirementsof 10 CFR 50, Appendix E, Section IV.F.3, for the conduct of an offsitefull-participation emergency preparedness exercise within 2 years of thelast such exercise in September 1985, provided that such an exercise beconducted within 120 days after the completion of the power ascension program.</ITAG>Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission had determined that the grantingof this Exemption extension would have no significant effect on the qualityof the human environment (53 FR 52528, December 28, 1988).
