(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Suffolk County, New York state and the Townof Southampton withheld information from the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission and should be dismissed from licensing proceedings forthe Shoreham power plant, say lawyers for the Long Island LightingCo.   ``The issue before this commission ultimately is who is in chargehere,'' said Donald P. Irwin, a lawyer for LILCO, which ownsShoreham.   Irwin argued Tuesday that the state and local governmentsdeliberately defied the licensing board in an attempt to keep theShoreham case in a legal morass that has lasted for 3{ years.   But a lawyer for Suffolk, Herbert Brown, said the county did notshow ``bad faith'' when officials refused to speculate before alicensing panel what they would do in the event of an accident atthe Shoreham plant.   Because the county has no evacuation plan, they could not saywhat they would do, he reasoned.   The NRC is considering whether to dismiss the state and localgovernments from the Shoreham licensing proceedings. NRC spokesmanFrank Ingram said he did not know when a decision might come.   If the state and local governments are dismissed, theoreticallyno objections would remain to licensing Shoreham.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>Panel Told Nation Should Use Natural Gas, Develop Safe Nuclear</NOTE><TEXT>   Power</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation should react to the greenhouseeffect on global warming by using natural gas instead of coal and bydeveloping ``safe and publicly acceptable'' nuclear power, a Housepanel was told.   Robert M. White, president of the National Academy ofEngineering, said Tuesday these are among measures needed to preventfurther build-up of greenhouse gases that could be responsible forglobal warming.   White and three other witnesses cautioned that scientists stilldo not know whether burning of fossil fuels and other humanactivities will cause significant temperature changes, leading toheat waves and drought.   One witness, University of Virginia professor Patrick J.Michaels, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee it would bemore prudent to await more study before making drastic policydecisions.   ``Our policy should be commensurate with the state of ourscientific knowledge,'' the professor of environmental sciences toldthe energy and power subcommittee.   Michaels said climate experts have a ``clouded vision'' of futureglobal warming, and added, ``basing sweeping environmental policy''on such uncertainties ``is especially risky, even if the policy isotherwise rational.''</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>GAO Says Agency Officials Ordered Changes in Report on Spotted Owl</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A congressional report says Fish and WildlifeService officials ordered a changes in a report in an effort to keepthe spotted owl off the endangered list.   The General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress, said officialsignored scientific evidence and ordered revisions in a studyprepared by biologists in the agency's Northwest regional office.Scientists had concluded that unless logging was slowed in ancientforests of the Northwest, the owl could face extinction.   The timber industry in the Northwest has opposed any effort toname the owl a threatened or endangered species, fearing that such amove would disrupt logging in public forests. Environmentalists haveadvocated protecting the owl as part of their campaign to haltlogging of old growth forests.   ``While changes are an inevitable part of any draft report reviewprocess, the nature of the changes made in this case and the waythey were made raise questions about whether objectivity wasmaintained,'' the GAO said.   The Fish and Wildlife Service, an Interior Department agencywhich determines what should be designated for protection asthreatened or endangered, is required to consider only ``biologicalfactors'' in making its decision.</TEXT></DOC>
