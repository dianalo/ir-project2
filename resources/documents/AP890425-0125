Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Defense MinisterGerhard Stoltenberg returned from Washington after a failed attemptto persuade the United States of a need for talks on theshort-range weapons.   U.S. officials held out against the West Germans, citing fearsthat negotiations on the weapons could lead to their eliminationand increase the threat from superior East bloc conventional forces.   West Germans, who in general believe the threat from the WarsawPact has been reduced, have become increasingly eager for the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization to speed up disarament talks with theSoviet bloc.   Despite Washington's refusal to budge, Genscher said WestGermany was sticking to its position and would continue discussionswithin NATO to resolve the stalemate.   ``We are going into the talks with our partners with the sameposition that we have already worked out,'' Genscher said.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative government, facingpossible defeat in next year's federal elections, has been tryingto woo voters in the face of the growing anti-military mood.   West Germany's opposition party, the Social Democrats, turned upthe heat on Kohl to not back down on the issue. Party chairmanHans-Jochen Vogel demanded that Kohl ``abide by the nationalconsensus.''   Vogel said short-range weapons should be ultimately removed fromWest Germany.   The debate over short-range nuclear weapons has createddivisions within the alliance with a key NATO summit just a monthaway.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who sides with theUnited States in the disagreement, is scheduled to fly to WestGermany on Sunday and is expected to take up the matter with Kohl.   The Netherlands, once one of the most anti-nuclear voices in theNATO alliance, also backed the United States.   ``The Dutch view doesn't match the German view as it has nowbeen publicized'' during Genscher's and Stoltenberg's Washingtonvisit, Foreign Ministry spokesman Peter van Vliet said Tuesday inThe Hague.   But Kohl has the support of several other NATO countries,including Norway, Belgium and Denmark.   Kohl also wants NATO to postpone a final decision on thealliance's plans for upgrading short-range nuclear weapons, and hasthe support of several smaller NATO countries.   Both Genscher and Stoltenberg said they were optimistic NATOwould be able to forge a common position on the nuclear weaponsbefore its summit in Brussels at the end of May. Neither officialgave any indication of a breakthrough.   Genscher said that during his visit to the United States, itbecame clear to him that Washington ``recognizes our right to havea say in this matter.''   Most of NATO's short-range nuclear weapons _ 88 Lance launcherswith a range of up to about 75 miles _ are based in West Germany.   Because of their short range, the nuclear-tipped missiles aredesigned to be used almost exclusively on German soil.   Genscher also said he believes that West Germany's view onshort-range weapons ``will have a significant effect on theformulation of a (common) position within the alliance,'' but hedid not elaborate.   Kohl's government, in a surprise move, announced last week thatit favors prompt superpower negotiations on reducing short-rangenuclear weapons. Just a week earlier, the Warsaw Pact made adetailed proposal for starting up such talks.   U.S. officials have said they fear the Warsaw Pact may be tryingto drive a wedge among NATO nations with a flurry of recentdisarmament proposals.</TEXT></DOC>
