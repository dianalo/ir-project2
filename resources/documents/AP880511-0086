Henry Klotz, who was elected mayor of South Africa's thirdlargest city last September, said he would rather be ousted fromthe party than retract his support for integration of the entireDurban beachfront.   ``The policy of opening facilities must be pursued and I shallsupport it absolutely,'' Klotz said in a statement. ``If this meansmy explusion from the National Party, then so be it.''   Durban, along with Cape Town, is one of South Africa's twolargest tourist destinations, and its Indian Ocean beachfront islined with resort hotels.   Klotz received a letter from the Natal Province branch of theparty on Tuesday saying he was being suspended for disloyaltybecause he refused to endorse President P.W. Botha's policy onsegregated beaches.   Botha has supported the integration of some beaches but saysother beaches should remain exclusively for whites. Durban'sbeaches reflect this policy _ most areas have been opened to allraces but one prime section called South Beach remains whites-only.   Klotz said he formerly opposed integration of beaches but nowfelt this step was essential ``if we are to succeed in becoming atruly 21st century, cosmopolitan city.''   ``All beaches are the property of all people of Durban inpartnership with visitors from South Africa and other countries,''he said. ``I am duty-bound to act in the interests of all thecitizens of this fair city and I shall do so for as long as I amable.''   The far-right Conservative Party, the largest white oppositionparty, won three parliamentary by-elections in March with acampaign platform opposing integrated beaches. Klotz said he didnot believe the issue was a key factor in the by-elections, whichwere held in districts far from the coast.   Last week, a court in Port Elizabeth ruled that the city councilhad acted without proper authority in 1966 when it proclaimed thelocal beaches segregated. The government promptly appealed theruling and said the beaches would remain segregated until theappeal process was completed.</TEXT></DOC>
