Canada's 26 million people are the largest foreign market forU.S. high-value products, accounting for almost 20 percent of thetotal exports of U.S. those items.   More than 85 percent of all U.S. agricultural exports to Canada_ $1.81 billion last year _ are in the form of high-value products.   By USDA definition, high-value products, or HVPs, are``value-added processed products and consumer-ready products suchas nuts, fresh fruits and vegetables.''   Glynn, in a report scheduled for the May issue of ForeignAgriculture magazine, said horticultural and tropical products makeup the largest component of high-value trade with Canada,accounting for nearly 62 percent of the U.S. high-value total.   Fresh vegetables lead the list and have shown ``a slow butsteady increase over the past several decades,'' he said.``Prospects for this trend to continue are favorable.''   Dairy, livestock and poultry products make up the next largestHVP category, led by undressed fur skins.   ``High-value grain and feed products, which have posted anannual growth rate of 8 percent since 1980, also show potential forfurther growth,'' Glynn said. ``Leading product groups arestarch-inulin-gluten products; prepared breakfast food; and bread,biscuits and cake.''   There is a potential also for fast foods such as frozen andmicrowavable products, and for foods with a short preparation time.   ``Although the outlook for trade appears good, labelingrequirements continue to present possible constraints,'' he said.``Canada uses the metric system, and metric weights and measuresmust be stated on the labels of all prepackaged consumer products.''   For example, sliced bacon must be marketed in 500-gram packages.One-pound packages _ 454 grams _ are not allowed.   ``Bilingual labeling is required for almost all consumer foodproducts entering Canada,'' Glynn said. ``French is one of the twoofficial languages in Canada and is the principal language in manyof the large urban areas of eastern Canada.''   The new U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement ``is expected to openthe doors to wider markets on both sides of the border,'' he said.``If the pact is approved by both nations, all tariff and somenon-tariff barriers to agricultural trade will be eliminated overthe next 10 years.''   But Glynn said that even with the new trade pact someconstraints will exist, particularly for high-value products.   For example, although discriminatory price markups on U.S. wineswill be eliminated, the sale of alcoholic beverages will remainunder the control of the sovereign provincial monopolies, he said.Each of those boards has its own set of rules and regulations thataffect liquor products sold in their jurisdictions.   Also, U.S. fresh fruits and vegetables could continue to faceseasonal restrictions because of a ``snapback'' provision in thepact which allows either country to apply tariffs for up to 180days a year under certain price and production conditions, Glynnsaid.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Agriculture Department removed some of thered tape hampering shipment of certain genetically engineeredorganisms from one state to another.   As a result, the department will allow the material to be movedinterstate between research facilities without a permit.   James W. Glosser, acting administrator of the department'sAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said Thursday agencyscientists found the commonly used laboratory organisms, whenproperly packaged, pose no risk to people, plants, animals or theenvironment.   Shippers must still follow conditions outlined by the agency,however, and the organisms must not contain ``genetic sequences''that would allow them to invade or damage plants.   The exempted laboratory microorganisms were Escherichia coligenotype K-12 and its derivatives, sterile strains of Saccharomycescerevisiae or asporogenic (non-spore forming) strains of Bacillussubtilis.   The microorganisms being exempted are not only non-toxic butcannot survive outside of carefully controlled laboratoryconditions, Glosser said. Therefore, in case of an accidental spillduring transport the organisms would perish and could not cause anydanger.   Glosser said the National Institutes of Health, whichadministers guidelines for genetic engineering research, also hasexcluded these organisms from risk categories that require specialcontainment.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There were fewer hens in the nation'segg-laying flocks last month, but they worked harder than they dida year ago, an Agriculture Department shows.   Production was estimated 5.96 billion eggs in March, a 1 percentdecline from a year earlier, the report said Thursday. But thetotal number of hens averaged 278 million last month, a 2 percentdecline from March 1987.   That put March egg output at an average of 2,147 eggs per 100layers, compared with 2,132 eggs from 100 birds a year earlier, thereport said.</TEXT></DOC>
