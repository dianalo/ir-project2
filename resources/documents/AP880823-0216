(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States should not be hinderedin adopting an energy policy encouraging the use of coal because ofconcerns about the ``greenhouse effect'' and acid rain, thepresident of the National Coal Association said.   Richard Lawson made his remarks while addressing a sessionMonday on energy and the environment at the Southern LegislativeConference, a gathering of about 2,000 lawmakers from 15 states andPuerto Rico.   ``It's time to quit treating energy as just another marketitem,'' he said. ``You'll never need air cover or a TOW (missile)to get a unit train (of coal) to a generating station.''   The lack of a national energy policy forces the United States tobend its foreign and military policies to protect its sources ofimported oil, making the true cost of that oil much higher than themarket price, said Lawson, a retired Air Force general.   Although he has headed the coal group for just over a year,Lawson said, ``I do know security and I do understand strategy, andI sense the vulnerability of our country in that area isincreasing.''   Estimates of domestic oil and gas reserves have declinedrecently, he said, while use of imported oil is greater now than in1973, the date of the first Arab oil embargo.   Lawson said the nation should reduce its use of imported oil tothe point that a price increase or cutoff would not be catastrophic.   He said the country also should offer incentives forconservation and development of domestic supplies, expand its useof coal, finance more research and development of technology toburn coal more cleanly, and develop synthetic fuels for use whenthe market makes them economically feasible.   He estimated that such a program, beginning in 1990, would cost$3 billion to $4 billion a year.   The unusually hot weather this summer and this decade has raisedconcern about the ``greenhouse effect,'' in which carbon dioxidefrom burning of fossil fuels reduces the heat that is radiated intospace.   Although the issue should not be ignored, Lawson said, fewscientists believe the climate is already getting hotter because ofthe effect.   ``A lot of imaginations are going in and out of focus,especially on Capitol Hill,'' he said.   Lawson said the greenhouse issue has been ``folded into'' thedebate on acid rain, which is caused when emissions fromcoal-burning plants react with other chemicals and water vapor inthe atmosphere.   Congress, he contended, should reject a pendingacid-rain-control bill to allow time for development of clean-coaltechnology, partly because acid rain is declining even though theuse of coal has increased.</TEXT></DOC>
