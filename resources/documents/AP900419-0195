The federal suit, filed Wednesday on behalf of theSimmons-controlled N.L. Industries in Houston, asked the court todeclare Simmons-backed nominees the winners or to set a newelection.   The suit accuses the incumbent board of directors of illegallyengineering extra proxy votes through an employee stock ownershipplan and playing a variety of dirty tricks to ensure that Simmonslost his fight.   ``This action seeks to restore integrity to the recent electionof Lockheed's Board of Directors and to ensure integrity in futureelections,'' said the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court.   Bob Meder, a Lockheed spokesman, said the company declined tocomment because officials had not seen the lawsuit.   Simmons lost a proxy fight for control of the aerospacecompany's board at the March 29 shareholder's meeting, but he wonmajor concessions for big shareholders.   Simmons contends that Calabassas-based Lockheed, the nation'ssixth largest defense contractor, has been mismanaged under theleadership of Chairman Daniel Tellep.   The Dallas investor's N.L. Industries owns 18.9 percent ofLockheed's common stock. He paid about $530 million for his sharesand is sitting on a paper loss of about $100 million.   Simmons was not available for comment on the lawsuit. A call tohis home was not answered and his spokesman did not immediatelyreturn a phone message.   The lawsuit accuses the company of starting the employee stockownership plan as ``an llegal entrenchment device'' whose votesshould have been disallowed in the election.   If the plan's votes and a few so-far challenged proxies werethrown out, Simmons' nominees would have won the election, the suitcontends.   The employee stock plan represented a large portion of thesupport for the current board, whose 14 incumbents won with supportranging from 57.6 percent to 60.7 percent. The employee plan holdsnearly 20 percent of Lockheed's stock.   Simmons has said he was dissatisfied with the way the trusteefor the employee stock ownership plan had voted a block of sharesbelieved to number at least 500,000 of the some 12 million sharesowned by the plan.   Hours after the shareholders meeting, a spokesman for the stockplan said the trustee did not receive voting instructions on thelarge block, but still voted those shares for management.   Simmons has said that in the absence of voting instructions,those shares should not have been voted for either side. Thetrustee, though, said it was his fiduciary responsibility to voteall of the plan's shares.   Lockheed said holders of 82 percent of its stock, 52,685,00shares of the 63,192,196 outstanding, had cast votes.   The lawsuit also accuses the company of taking a number oflast-minute steps to allegedly steal the election.   These steps included moving the annual meeting up six weeks fromits usual date to rob N.L. Industries of time to prepare, andsending out proxy materials that failed to mention the existence ofa competing slate of directors, the suit alleges.   The suit also complained that managers refused to help N.L.Industries approach Lockheed workers who would be voting to explainSimmons's side of the dispute.   Separately, Simmons struck a conciliatory note in an April 16letter to Tellep that was disclosed in a filing he made Wednesdaywith the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington.   ``I firmly believe that, notwithstanding litigation, we can worktogether productively to maximize share values for all Lockheedshareholders, and I look forward to doing so,'' the letter said.   Simmons suggested in the letter that Tellep explore ``thefeasibility of a $1 billion stock repurchase plan.'' He alsosuggested the sale of non-strategic or underperforming assets toraise about $1 billion.   Lockheed spokesman Ron Meder declined to comment on the letter,saying only, ``Basically it's just a rehash of all the issuesraised in the proxy contest.''</TEXT></DOC>
