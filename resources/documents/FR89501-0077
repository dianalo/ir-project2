This project under the provisions of Chapter55, Title 10, section 1092, will test the feasibility of giving the MedicalTreatment Facility Commander both the authority and responsibility forall health care delivery within his catchment area. By controlling boththe Operation and Maintenance, Army (OMA) and the projected Civilian Healthand Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) budgets, it isanticipated that the Commander can enhance both the quality and quantityof health care delivery within the catchment area while containing costs.The purpose of the CAM is to demonstrate that the escalating cost of CHAMPUS-fundedcivilian health care provided to CHAMPUS beneficiaries within an Army MTFcatchment area can be contained at a level less than the currently forecastedamount by giving the MTF commander authority to provide for alternate expendituresusing the catchment area's budgeted CHAMPUS funds. An independent evaluationof this demonstration will be conducted by a contractor who will performadministrative research, data collection, analysis, and evaluative reportingservices to determine the degree to which health care services at the demonstrationsites are being provided in a manner which meets the stated objectivesof the demonstration. The objectives of the demonstrations are to (1) containthe rate of growth of government health care expenditures, (2) improveaccessibility to health care services, (3) improve beneficiary and providersatisfaction with the availability and accessibility of health care services,(4) maintain the quality of care provided to the CHAMPUS beneficiary population.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>Implementation starting date of this demonstrationis 1 June 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Major Paul Mouritsen, Office ofThe Army Surgeon General, Program, Analysis and Evaluation Division, DASG-RMP,Skyline 5, 5111 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, VA 22041-3258, telephone (202)756-0273.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>Until recently, there was no mechanism to convert savings in CHAMPUS workloadinto increased resources in the MTF. In FY88, the CHAMPUS appropriationwas allocated to the individual Service and each Service is responsiblefor the total CHAMPUS bill for care provided to its beneficiaries. In anattempt to evaluate the Services' assertion that they could effectivelymanage these funds and provide necessary medical care within the projectedCHAMPUS budget, Congress directed in the FY88 Defense Authorization Actthat each of the Services conduct a demonstration of catchment area managementin at least one area. During the demonstration all normal CHAMPUS requirementsapply except those that are specifically identified herein as subject todemonstration deviation.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. What the Demonstration is Designed to Test</ITAG>Catchment Area Management is based on the premise that the local MTF commanderis responsible for all medical care provided to the eligible DOD beneficiarypopulation within a radius of approximately 40 miles of the MTF. To fulfillthat responsibility, the commander will be given both the funds normallyallocated to operate the MTF, and the funds projected to be spent for civiliancare under CHAMPUS. At the same time, he will be relieved of some regulatoryrestrictions that impede his ability to select the most cost-effectiveoptions in delivering care to the beneficiary population. The demonstrationwill test whether, by merging the CHAMPUS and direct care dollars, theMTF commander can provide an enhanced level of services while maintainingquality and not exceed the combined MTF OMA and CHAMPUS costs currentlypredicted to be incurred in the absence of this demonstration. A HealthCare Finder function and enrollment feature are mandatory elements in theCAM demonstration.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Key Features of Each Site</ITAG>The Fort Sill demonstration will be organized around the existing FamilyPractice model. The Health Care Finder function will be decentralized tothe five family practice clinics, with central coordination provided bythe Catchment Area Management project office. Enhancements to encourageenrollment will include an enhanced optometry benefit and a reduction ofthe standard CHAMPUS deductible and cost share. The enhanced optometrybenefit given to CAM enrollees at Fort Sill consists of an annual eye examinationand prescription for eye glasses as required. The eye examination is composedof a screening by the technician and an examination by the optometrist.The technician will conduct a galucoma test using a NCT (noncontactonometer),and near vision acuity and distance visual acuity tests using eye charts.Once the screening is completed, the optometrist will see the patient andevaluate the physical health and condition of the eyes as well as completea refraction when indicated during the screening exam.The second enhancement is a reduction of the standard CHAMPUS deductibleand copayment. Under the CAM demonstration, if an enrolled beneficiaryis required to receive care outside the MTF, the costs to the member areas follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s30,r10</C> <H1>AD/Family members</H1><H1>Retiree's family members/others</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Outpatient_No deductible 15 percent copayment<D>No deductible 20 percent copayment.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Inpatient_Subsistence or $25 whichever is greater<D>20 percent or $210 per day whichever is less.</D></ITAG></ITAG>Health care services will be expanded through the use of Partnership Agreementswith individual and group providers from outside the catchment area andthrough other service contracts and fee for service agreements. Beneficiariesmust elect to enroll as a family unit. Enrollment may be accomplished atany time. Use of Standard CHAMPUS is always an alternative to enrollmentin the demonstration project. However, once enrolled, a family must usemedical resources provided by the program. Disenrollment is authorizedduring the entire month of October for each year of the demonstration.Disenrollment is an option when a grievance is submitted to the MTF Commanderand he validates the complaint. Families will also be disenrolled whenthey move out of the catchment area or lose eligibility. For care providedto beneficiaries outside of the CAM area, Standard CHAMPUS will apply.Standard CHAMPUS claims will not be honored by the Fiscal Intermediaryfor program enrollees. Separate FI procedures will identify catchment areaenrollee claims, preauthorized claims and preauthorized out of catchmentarea claims. Enrollees will receive non-emergency primary care appointmentswithin seven days. Claims processing will be done by the fiscal intermediary.Only CHAMPUS eligible beneficiaries may enroll in the CAM. The Health CareFinder (HCF) will be responsible for having all referrals reviewed andappointed as required by the appropriate clinic in the MTF. If the referralis for outside the MTF, utilization will be approved by the Deputy Commanderfor Clinical Services (DCCS) and the HCF will schedule the appointmentwith the appropriate preferred provider. The HCF will then notify the beneficiaryas to the time and date of the appointment.The Fort Carson demonstration is focused on maximizing the use of the MTFthrough the use of personal and non-personal contracts, partnership agreements,and control of enrolled beneficiary referrals. The first enrollment incentivewill include a reduction of the standard CHAMPUS deductible and copayment.Under the CAM demonstration, if an enrolled beneficiary is required toreceive care outside the MTF, the costs to the member are: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s30,r10</C> <H1>AD/Family members</H1><H1>Retiree's family members/others</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Outpatient_No deductible 15 percent copayment<D>No deductible 20 percent copayment.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Inpatient_No change from Standard CHAMPUS<D>20 percent or $210 per day whichever is less.</D></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Services not available at the MTF will be obtained from the AlternateHealth Care Delivery System in the community at rates negotiated by theMTF. The Fort Carson MTF catchment area incorporates a large overlap withthe US Air Force Academy MTF catchment area. Enrollment in Fort Carson'sEvans Army Community Hospital Plan commits the beneficiary to seeking carefrom Evans ACH, the Air Force Academy Hospital, or Peterson AFB HealthClinic as the first avenue in the integrated health care system, and commitsEvans ACH to finding health care for the enrollee from either Evans ACH,another DoD Facility or from the Alternate Health Care Delivery System.All beneficiaries in the overlap will be eligible to enroll in the FortCarson CAM demonstration. Fort Carson will assume responsibility for allCHAMPUS payments within the overlap area with a concurrent adjustment ofCHAMPUS funding between the Services. The second enrollment incentive,Psychiatric partial hospitalization, will be opened to all beneficiarieson a total catchment area basis. Partial psychiatric hospitalization isan alternative to inpatient treatment in which a patient attends treatmentfor a 12 hour period or less and does not occupy an overnight bed. Twenty-fourhours or partial psychiatric hospitalization will equate to one day ofinpatient psychiatric care. An enrollee may accrue a total of 60 days ofeither inpatient psychiatric care, partial psychiatric hospitalizationor a combination thereof, as long as the total combination (inpatient andpartial) does not exceed 60 days. For enrollees, partial psychiatric hospitalizationwill be processed as outpatient care with no deductible and the specialenrollee outpatient copayment. The extension of psychiatric care beyond60 days may be applied under existing OCHAMPUS review, as with StandardCHAMPUS. Administration and management of the CAM demonstration will bethrough the newly created Patient Services Division which incorporateselements of the Clinical Support Division, the Patient Administration Division,the Health Care Finder function, and all liaison with the contractors andthe CHAMPUS FI. All CHAMPUS claims will be processed by the contract provider.For those who enroll in the system, the CHAMPUS outpatient deductible willbe waived. As part of the enrollment agreement, enrollees will not be reimbursedfor any Standard CHAMPUS use within the catchment area, should they decideto seek care outside of their plan, unless preauthorization has been receivedfrom the plan. Disenrollment is authorized anytime. However, once disenrolled,a beneficiary may not enroll again until the next scheduled enrollmentperiod. Enrollment is only open to beneficiaries who reside within thecatchment area. The plan covers preauthoriztion or emergency claims withinthe catchment area. Claims generated by enrollees outside the catchmentarea will be paid under the provisions of Standard CHAMPUS. As with theFort Sill plan, preauthorization of care outside the MTF will be done bythe HCF. The Fort Carson plan includes part of the Patient Services Divisionconcept, Project CARE (Coordinate Appropriate Resources Effectively), anotherOCHAMPUS demonstration that provides for individual case management forhigh cost patients where alternatives to hospitalization may prove to bemore cost effective. Both demonstrations alter the normally applicable cost-sharing requirementsin the CHAMPUS regulation, DOD 6010.8-R, Chapter 4, Section F. In additionto reduced cost share requirements, the additional discounts availablefrom the preferred providers will further reduce the actual beneficiarycost share. All network providers will accept the discounted CHAMPUS-determinedallowable change as payment in full, so that the beneficiary's financialresponsibility will be limited to the copayment. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Programs Savings</ITAG>The Department of the Army anticipates that the Catchment Area ManagementDemonstration will provide an enhanced level of services at discountedrates which will result in more health care being obtained with no increasein the combined CHAMPUS and direct care budgets. Savings depend on thepercentage of beneficiaries who enroll in the plans and the number of preferredproviders who are enticed to participate. It is possible that additionalsavings may result from non-network providers reducing fees to remain competitivewith the preferred provider network and from including the discounted paymentrates in the calculations of new CHAMPUS prevailing charge profiles forthese states beginning with the next scheduled update of state prevailingcharges. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Duration </ITAG>The legislative authority for the CAM demonstration become effective Oct.1, 1987. Actual implementation will begin on June 1, 1989 and will continuefor at least two years from the date services are initiated at each demonstrationsite.<ITAG tagnum="6">Linda Bynum,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Alternate OSD Federal Register Liaison Officer, Department of Defense.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="34">April 25, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-10383 Filed 4-28-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3910-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
