The New York-based conglomerate pleaded guilty Monday in federalcourt to a charge of conspiring to defraud the government.   The company admitted that an employee of its defense technologydivision in 1984 and early 1985 spent about $15,000 and wasreimbursed for illegal gifts _ including liquor, sports and theatertickets, meals and golf games _ to Air Force officials at HanscomAir Force Base in Bedford.   In exchange, ITT received copies of internal governmentdocuments with confidential procurement information on two AirForce programs ITT was interested in pursuing.   ITT was indicted in June 1987, several months before a separatefederal investigation into the use of consultants by corporationsto get information for use in bidding for contracts. ITT officialssaid the case was not tied to that investigation.   ``This office will continue to ferret out and prosecutevigorously fraud and corruption in the defense industry,'' U.S.Attorney Frank L. McNamara said in a statement.   Edward M. Vicenzi, a senior marketing representative of ITT'sVan Nuys, Calif.-based Gilfillan subsidiary, which specializes inradar technology, pleaded guilty in July to the same charge. Hefaces up to 35 years in prison and a $500,000 fine on the charges.   ``We pleaded guilty to the fact that the person involved was ouremployee when he acted improperly,'' ITT Chairman Rand V. Araskogsaid in a statement. ``We had no choice because that employeepleaded guilty.''   According to the indictment in the case, Vicenzi was hired inAugust 1983 to pursue two Air Force contracts _ an anti-radiationmissile decoy system valued at more than $80 million and a mobileair traffic control radar system worth between $100 million and$150 million.   Vicenzi's $60,000-a-year job was to get inside governmentinformation on the programs, including Air Force plans,specifications, procurement strategy and projected costs, theindictment said.   He reportedly had close ties with procurement officials at theAir Force's Electronics Systems Division at Hanscom, which isresponsible for buying all of the Air Force's electronics systems.   Four government employees who received gratuities from Vincenzigave him copies of documents with information on the contracts aswell as general planning and funding documents, including theentire minutes of an Air Force meeting for the missile decoysystem, the indictment said.   He then sent the documents to other ITT Gilfillan employees,including senior business development officials, engineers andprogram managers, writing ``This is extremely sensitive'' or ``Donot acknowledge our possession of this document.''   ITT Gilfillan won a preliminary $6.4 million developmentcontract for the $80 million missile decoy system, which would haveprotected U.S. radar sites by luring homing missiles away from aradar installation, the indictment said. Neither that system northe radar control system, known as MPN-XX, was ever built.   Federal prosecutors told the U.S. District Judge David S. Nelsonthat several ITT employees tried to hide Vicenzi's activities bydestroying or concealing the documents after word was out of aninvestigation. ITT said Vicenzi was fired in 1986 in an unrelatedmatter.   Vicenzi allegedly had repeated contact with Maurice Raciti, adeputy program manager in logistics at Hanscom who resigned fromthe Air Force in late 1986 after Air Force oficials suspended himpending the outcome of the federal investigation. Raciti has notbeen charged.   The indictment said Vicenzi on numerous occasions met withRaciti and ``bought him lunches, paid for him to play golf,provided him with tickets to sporting and theater events and gavehim gifts of liquor.''   The Defense Department suspended its business with ITT Gillifanfrom July to November 1987 because of the Justice Departmentinvestigation.</TEXT></DOC>
