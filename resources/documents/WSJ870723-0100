It also sparked speculation that the company might seek a way to go private.    Several analysts hailed the move as a first step toward reversing the bleak earnings picture. &quot;I think it's a good solution to a number of dilemmas that have faced the company over the last year,&quot; said James Wei, an analyst for Tucker, Anthony andamp; R. L. Day, a New York brokerage firm. He suggested, for example, that Salomon might be able to use its real estate contacts to find buyers for some of Radice's under-utilized office buildings.    It isn't clear what path the company will chart with Salomon, although one analyst suggested Radice might do better as a private business, given its unpredictable earnings flow. &quot;This company has been so erratic and its results have been so dependent on big property sales, it's just a waste of time to try to project earnings,&quot; said Kenneth Campbell, an analyst with Audit Investments Inc., Montvale, N.J.    For the year ended June 30, 1986, Radice reported a loss of $4.9 million on revenue of $120.8 million. For the first nine months of this year, Radice reported a loss of $11.3 million, on revenue of $35.5 million.    The company's stock, which traded as high as $17.625 early last year, has hovered just over $5 a share in recent days. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Radice closed at $6.50, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
