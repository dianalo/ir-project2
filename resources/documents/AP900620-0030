Thirty years ago Iran was a food exporter. Now it has to spend$2 billion to $4 billion a year on food imports. That's a third ofits total import bill.   Food subsidies cost another $1.75 billion a year, straining aneconomy that is in poor shape after a decade of mismanagement andthe 1980-88 war with Iraq.   President Hashemi Rafsanjani's government has allocated $64billion for agricultural development in its its five-year plan _one-third invested by the government and the rest by the privatesector.   ``The question is not whether agriculture can be boosted, but ifit can race to keep up with the population,'' a U.N. official said.   ``Under the Shah, agricultural production did increase, but sodid the population. But since the revolution there has been adefinite downward trend in agriculture,'' said the official, whospoke on condition of anonymity.   The late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi launched agriculturalreforms before he was toppled in the 1979 Islamic revolution. Butagricultural production was falling behind population growth longbefore the monarch's ouster.   That trend has accelerated since the revolution, despite erraticattempts to boost food production.   Iran's population, about 55 million, is swelling at the alarmingrate of 3.9 percent a year, one of the highest in the world. Bycomparison, India's population is growing at 2.2 percent, andChina's is increasing at 1.4 percent.   If Iran's current birth rate continues unchecked, the populationwill reach 140 million in 20 years.   Iranian officials contend that attempts to curb the birth rateso far have been half-hearted, partly because many Shiite Moslemclergymen maintain that birth control is proscribed by Islam.   The mullahs argue that a large population will help Iran becomethe leader of the Islamic world and ensure its power and prosperity.   The Iran Statistics Center reported in March that the countryhas 138 million acres of arable land, but just 39 million acres arebeing cultivated.   The Statistics Center noted that wheat, barley and riceproduction have increased considerably since 1982 but still lagbehind population growth.   A lot of farmland fell into disuse during the war, when fundswere channeled to the military, and an estimated 750,000 people ayear move from the countryside to the cities.   Former Tehran Mayor Morteza Tabatabaie noted recently that themass migration to the cities ``has caused irreparable damage to theagricultural sector.''   Until the mid-1960s, more than one-third of Iranians worked onfarms and the country was able to feed itself. Today, onlyone-eighth of the population works in agriculture _ and thegovernment is hard pressed to keep people on the farm.   The population of Tehran, the capital, has mushroomed from 3million a decade ago to around 10 million. Other cities such asIsfahan, Shiraz, Tabriz and Mashhad are bursting at the seams aswell.   Ali, a 36-year-old construction worker in Tehran, said hisfamily has farmed for generations in northern Gilan province. Buthe and his three brothers were forced to leave their land becausethey could no longer make a living there.   ``Shortages forced us to buy seeds, fertilizers and pesticidesat exorbitant prices,'' he said as he shared a lunch of bread andcheese with two other workers on a Tehran construction site.   ``But when we demanded higher prices for our products we wereforced to sell at officially designated rates _ at a loss,'' hecomplained. ``After living with dignity under my father's roof, Idon't like this life.''   To lure farmers back to their villages, a massive land reformprogram, snarled in the bureacratic morass for years, is beingpushed through Parliament.   The program aims to force large land-owning governmentorganizations to break up their holdings.   Redistribution of land has been a political football since therevolution, with radicals campaigning for breaking up the vastestates once owned by the shah's acolytes and conservativesinsisting they should be left alone.   Officials agree that the birth rate should have been checkedyears ago and believe it will be years before it can.   Just three years ago, the government was offering incentives tofamilies to produce children for the ``jihad,'' or holy war,against Iraq, which has a population one-third Iran's.</TEXT></DOC>
