The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,ruling on a complaint by the National Association of RegulatoryUtility Commissioners, said the FCC could step into matters of statetelephone regulation only when state rules interfere with the FCC'sregulation of interstate phone service.   The court found that the FCC in 1987 exceeded its authority whenit pre-empted state regulation of the ``inside wiring'' business _the on-premise wiring that connects residential and single-linebusiness customers to the telephone network.   The court said the FCC may pre-empt state authority only ``to thedegree necessary to keep such regulation from negating thecommission's exercise of its lawful authority over interstatecommunication service.''   The court ordered the FCC to reconsider the inside wiring matter.   The opinion was written by Circuit Judge James L. Buckley, andwas joined by Judges Spottswood W. Robinson III and Abner J. Mikva.   However, the court agreed with the FCC that the commission mayproscribe state regulations that would result in the subsidizationof the installation and maintenance of inside wiring by the generalratepayers because it would allow the phone companies to undercutcompetition.   The court said the FCC may, for example, force states to separatethe costs of installation and maintenance from basic telephoneservice rates.   The FCC had ordered that inside wiring installation andmaintenance be deregulated and that phone companies be relieved ofthe requirement to install and maintain such wiring. The FCC saidindividual customers should pay for their own installation andmaintenance and that such costs should not be absorbed into basictelephone service charges.   The commission reasoned that deregulation would stimulate newcompetition and create a market for ``do-it-yourself'' kits, andthus lead to savings for customers.   Under the 1934 Communications Act, the FCC regulates interstatetelephone service and states have authority over intrastate phoneservice. But in its deregulation order, the FCC said it mustpre-empt state authority over inside wiring.   The commission argued that a federal program of competitive,deregulated inside wiring could not coexist with a regulated statesystem unless consumers were required to purchase two sets of insidewiring _ one for interstate and the other for intrastate use.   The FCC also said inside wiring was not a ``common carrier''telephone company service and therefore was not subject to stateregulation.   NARUC and a host of state utility commissions challenged the FCCorder, saying states should have the right to require phonecompanies to be inside wiring installers of last resort and thatdo-it-yourself kits are not an acceptable substitute for a trainedinstaller.</TEXT></DOC>
