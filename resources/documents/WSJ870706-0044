Tomorrow, congressional hearings into the scandal will begin focusing more closely on that inquiry, with Lt. Col. Oliver North as the first witness. Investigators will concentrate especially on six crucial days when false chronologies were assembled and classified documents were altered, shredded or smuggled off the White House grounds.    Lawmakers contend that Mr. Meese and his aides failed to safeguard evidence, aggressively pursue leads or quickly confront senior Reagan administration officials involved in suspected improprieties. Even more, some critics suggest that the investigation may have been part of a larger damage-control strategy intended to shield Mr. Reagan from political trouble and embarrassment.    Sen. David Boren (D., Okla.), a member of the Senate Iran-Contra investigating committee, faults the attorney general's &quot;surprising lapse&quot; of judgment in not &quot;becoming suspicious sooner&quot; about alleged attempts to hinder inquiries into the affair. Even conservative Rep. Henry Hyde (R., Ill.), a staunch defender of the administration and outspoken supporter of the Contra cause, admits to &quot;a terribly let-down feeling that a cause so many of us believed in has to be served by deceptions and lies.&quot;    Important facts about the Meese inquiry won't be known until Col. North, the fired National Security Council aide; Rear Adm. John Poindexter, the former White House national security adviser; and Mr. Meese himself testify. But information already gathered by investigators through documents and through the sworn testimony of individuals involved reveals how top Reagan administration officials initially reacted to the fast-breaking events, and then tried to devise a plan to cope with them.    The first warnings of the impending scandal came Wednesday, Nov. 19, at a news conference: Mr. Reagan stumbled over an answer about Israel's role in early U.S. arms sales to Iran, and the White House issued a clarification about &quot;third country&quot; involvement. Apparently sensing that more controversy was looming, Adm. Poindexter invited the attorney general to the White House the next day to help review a chronology and coming congressional testimony dealing with the secret initiative toward Iran. Here are the major developments in the six days that followed:    Nov. 20: Late-Night Call   Mr. Meese left to give a speech at the U.S. Military Academy before the end of the Poindexter meeting. But he received a worried, late-night call from Assistant Attorney General Charles Cooper complaining about &quot;gaps in information&quot; and cut short his trip to take charge of &quot;ironing out any and all discrepancies,&quot; according to Mr. Cooper's testimony.    Around the same time, Secretary of State George Shultz warned the president that testimony slated to be delivered by then-Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey on Capitol Hill the next morning &quot;would not stand up to scrutiny.&quot; Abraham Sofaer, the State Department's top legal adviser, had threatened to resign if Mr. Casey's draft testimony wasn't revised, and Mr. Cooper concurred &quot;that there would be a lot of us who left government under such circumstances.&quot;    Nov. 21: Fact Finding   Changes were made in Mr. Casey's testimony, but when Mr. Meese's staff told him of other discrepancies between information provided by the CIA and the State Department, the attorney general decided to take the initiative. During a meeting with the president and then-White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, Mr. Meese has told congressional investigators, the attorney general obtained permission to conduct a weekend &quot;fact-finding&quot; mission. Within hours, he assembled a team that included Mr. Cooper and Assistant Attorney General William Reynolds but didn't include the department's senior criminal investigators. Mr. Meese told then-Federal Bureau of Investigation Director William Webster that FBI involvement wasn't warranted.    The attorney general also advised Adm. Poindexter that Justice Department officials would review documents at the NSC offices the next morning, although &quot;there was absolutely no indication of any illegality or any wrongdoing,&quot; Mr. Meese has said. But that afternoon, White House National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane has testified, while driving downtown with Col. North for Mr. McFarlane's initial interview with Mr. Meese, the colonel told him about plans for a &quot;shredding party.&quot;    Mr. McFarlane didn't pass on the information to Mr. Meese or other investigators, and Col. North and his secretary, Fawn Hall, before leaving work that evening, destroyed an 18-inch-high stack of documents, according to testimony by Miss Hall.    Nov. 22: Smoking Gun   With Col. North looking on and reportedly cracking jokes about hiring an attorney, Mr. Reynolds discovered the so-called smoking gun memo: A five-page document, undated and unsigned, spelling out plans to divert to the Nicaraguan Contras about $12 million of the proceeds from the Iranian arms sales.    Investigators believe the memo was written by Col. North and addressed to Adm. Poindexter, and they have found a computer message dated April 7, 1986, in which Col. North suggested that at least parts of the memo were to go to &quot;our boss.&quot; Mr. Reagan has denied knowing about or approving any such diversion, and neither the committees nor the attorneys working for Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel investigating the affair, have contradicted Mr. Reagan's statements.    Mr. Meese discussed the surprise memo with his aides over a late lunch, and everyone immediately recognized that &quot;it had political significance of a very large nature,&quot; Mr. Cooper has told lawmakers. Mr. Meese apparently wanted to interview Col. North immediately, but for reasons that aren't clear, the meeting was postponed. The attorney general turned to the CIA for answers: He told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he met with former CIA general counsel Stanley Sporkin and visited CIA Director Casey at home, although he didn't confront Mr. Casey with the memo.    In fact, the attorney general has told reporters, &quot;I don't remember anything about a suspicion of diversion to the Contras&quot; coming up during the conversation with Mr. Casey.    Nov. 23: North Is Confronted   Col. North assured Mr. McFarlane that all his actions had been approved by his superiors. Col. North then met with retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord and Washington attorney Thomas Green. Investigators have questioned whether that session, and two others involving the three men in the next two days, were part of a cover-up. Gen. Secord and Mr. Green have denied doing anything improper.    In midafternoon, Mr. Meese finally confronted Col. North with the memo. Col. North paused, &quot;appeared to be visibly surprised,&quot; Mr. Cooper testified, and then acknowledged that money had been diverted to the Contras. According to investigators, Col. North said that Mr. McFarlane and Adm. Poindexter knew of the activities, but that Mr. Reagan wasn't informed of any diversion plan.    During a tense moment in the interview, according to Mr. Cooper, Col. North asked whether the Justice Department had found a cover note indicating where final versions of the memo may have been distributed. When he was told it hadn't been discovered, Col. North offered to reexamine his office files.    Mr. Meese has said he still didn't think a criminal investigation was warranted because only trusted officials were involved, and the memo &quot;on its face&quot; didn't indicate whether any money had gone to the Contras. The attorney general scheduled Mr. McFarlane for another interview, but he has told reporters that it didn't seem necessary to take precautions against possible communication between Col. North and Adm. Poindexter.    Nov. 24: Possible Violations   Mr. Meese told his staff to determine whether criminal laws may have been violated, then reported back to the president and Mr. Regan, asking for more time for his review. It still isn't clear when, or even if, Mr. Meese asked Mr. Reagan point-blank if the diversion had been authorized. But during a brief interview with Adm. Poindexter, Mr. Meese has told lawmakers, the national security adviser said he felt responsible for the diversion and had decided to resign.    Mr. Meese met once more with the president and his chief of staff and reportedly told them of possible criminal violations. Mr. Meese also briefed Vice President George Bush on the investigation; according to the attorney general, Mr. Bush also denied any knowledge of the diversion.    Nov. 25: 'Momentous Occasion'   Mr. Meese met Mr. Casey at 7 a.m. at the CIA director's home, and lawmakers are expected to closely question Mr. Meese about what the two men discussed. In any event, the attorney general joined the president and Mr. Regan two hours later to decide how to release news of the Contra diversion. Everyone in the meeting realized it was &quot;a very momentous occasion,&quot; the Senate Intelligence Committee report quotes Mr. Meese as recalling.    Mr. Meese's news conference shocked the capital. Afterward, Mr. Meese has told lawmakers, he discussed the Iran-Contra affair &quot;in general terms&quot; with the president and then told Mr. Reagan &quot;I was going back to the Justice Department because we were pursuing the criminal investigation.&quot;    Col. North, who already had been fired, let himself into his NSC offices with his White House pass and helped his secretary smuggle out documents. Two days later, federal agencies were instructed to safeguard all documents related to the affair.    ---                     SIX CRUCIAL DAYS   Nov. 20   -- Shultz warns Reagan about veracity of Casey'scongressional testimony.
