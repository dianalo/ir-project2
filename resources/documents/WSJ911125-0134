Seib   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>11/25/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), NO PAGE CITATION</SO><GV>EXECUTIVE (EXE)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The Central Intelligence Agency, stuck inneutral for months during Robert Gates's battle to beconfirmed as its leader, suddenly is hurtling towardfundamental change.   This rapid shift has gone largely unnoted here because, asusually happens with intelligence affairs, it is taking placebehind closed doors. But knowledgeable officials inside theintelligence community and in Congress are struck by thespeed with which the intelligence bureaucracy has launched are-examination of its place in the post-Cold War world in the20 days since Mr. Gates was confirmed as director of centralintelligence.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Gates still is sure to face enormous problems as hepushes his strategy for change. Yet Sen. David Boren, theOklahoma Democrat who heads the Senate Intelligence Committeeand who heard Mr. Gates outline his plans a few days ago,declares: &quot;I think changes are going to be coming fairlyquickly.&quot;   The centerpiece of the Gates strategy is a three-pagedirective President Bush has sent to the heads of governmentdepartments and agencies. It declares that changes growingout of the end of the Cold War &quot;urgently require atop-to-bottom examination&quot; of the intelligence community'smission. As the first step in that process, Mr. Bush orderedall government agencies immediately to re-examine the kindsof intelligence they think they will need by the year 2005.   The directive cites global health problems and loomingshortages of natural resources as areas that might need a newlook, and orders officials to think about the kinds ofeconomic intelligence they will need. As one sign of thebreadth of the administration's review, the directive hasbeen sent to agencies as far removed from traditionalintelligence work as the Environmental Protection Agency.   The agencies are ordered to finish re-examining theirneeds by Jan. 15. By March 20, Mr. Gates is to digest thelist of new intelligence demands and offer the NationalSecurity Council his plan for modifying the U.S. intelligencecommunity, a sprawling giant that comprises not only the CIAbut a dozen associated intelligence offices in the Pentagonand elsewhere in the government.   While this re-examination by users of intelligence isgoing on, Mr. Gates also has established task forces withinthe intelligence community to rethink the way it doesbusiness, officials say. Those groups, which will includeintelligence pros and some experts from outside thegovernment, will look at such issues as how the CIA mightbecome more open and what kinds of intelligence the militarywill require in the future.   Perhaps as important as these bureaucratic moves, Mr.Gates is trying to salve wounds opened by his nominationfight, during which some of his own CIA colleagues steppedforward to oppose him. They complained that when Mr. Gatesheld senior agency jobs during the Reagan administration, hecolored intelligence analysis to fit the Reagan agenda andintimidated other analysts into doing the same.   Soon after taking over at the CIA's headquarters justoutside Washington, Mr. Gates called two of the analysts whohad spoken out against him to say their actions wouldn't beheld against them, officials say. That pleased lawmakers, whohad advised Mr. Gates not to seek retribution.   Mr. Gates tried to deliver a similar conciliatory messagewhen he called together the CIA's senior managers. Hismessage was that &quot;there are no lists, I want to work witheveryone,&quot; says Joseph DeTrani, the head of CIA publicaffairs, who was there. CIA employees have been told togather next week so Mr. Gates can explain his plans forchange.   None of these early moves will eliminate all of thesignificant problems Mr. Gates faces. Suspicions of him willpersist at the CIA, and may assure internal friction once hegoes beyond studying changes to actually making them.   Moreover, his long confirmation battle kept him fromhaving much impact on the just-completed intelligence budgetfor this fiscal year. Yet Mr. Gates knows that if he doesn'tact quickly to streamline the intelligence community,Congress will do the job for him.   Mr. Gates already has moved to keep peace with Congress.As a gesture to the intelligence committees, which grilledhim about CIA efforts to keep from lawmakers details of theIran-Contra affair, Mr. Gates met privately with both theHouse and Senate panels last week to discuss his plans.</TEXT></DOC>
