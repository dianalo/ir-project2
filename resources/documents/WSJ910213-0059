Officers, directors and major shareholders at both firmsrecently have either sold or filed notice of their intentionsto sell million-dollar blocks of stock in the high-techhigh-fliers.</LP><TEXT>   Although most of those insiders still retain substantialholdings in Apple and Microsoft, their aggressive sellingraises the question: Is there much steam left in thesestocks?   In recent months, both Apple and Microsoft have surged &quot;byconsistently outperforming even the most optimistic Streetconsensus&quot; for earnings and new product sales, said DavidBayer, a computer-industry analyst at Montgomery Securities.Apple's stock has been on a tear since early October; it hasclimbed 49% since Oct. 1. Similarly, Microsoft's share pricehas climbed 53% since then; much of that gain has come in thelast six weeks.   Earnings for both firms in the most recent quarter came inwell above expectations, boosted by warm receptions to newproducts. In Apple's case, its new, lower-priced Macintoshcomputer line has been a success. Microsoft has prosperedwith its popular new Windows 3.0 graphics software.   As for the insiders, from Jan. 25 through Jan. 31, twoofficers, one director and a major shareholder filed noticewith the SEC of their intentions to sell sizablestockholdings in Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif. In total,the four filed plans to sell 252,000 shares valued, at thestock's closing price yesterday of $60, at about $15.1million.   Under SEC rules, insiders are required to file formaldeclarations of their intentions to sell shares (called aForm 144) when they plan to sell so-called restricted shares.In most cases, the sales take place simultaneously with thefiling of the form, but, under SEC rules, the sales can bereported as much as six weeks later.   Of the 252,000 Apple shares slated for sale, Apple'schairman, John Sculley, filed on Jan. 31 his intention tosell 100,000 shares, most of which he had acquired throughthe exercise of options in October 1989, SEC filings show.Mr. Sculley is a frequent seller and sold a similar amount ofstock last May.   The insider selling the most substantial amount of stockis Albert Eisenstat, Apple's secretary and executive vicepresident, who is selling shares for the first time sinceJune 1988, according to the filings. He plans to sell 129,000Apple shares valued yesterday at about $7.7 million; the salewould represent roughly half his stock in the company. BothMr. Sculley and Mr. Eisenstat declined to comment.   At Microsoft, based in Redwood, Wash., four insiders solda total of 453,900 shares in the past month. The shares werevalued, at Microsoft's closing price yesterday of $103.25, atabout $46.9 million.   Microsoft Chairman William H. Gates III trimmed hisholdings by 350,000 shares last month, but retains almost 40million more. Another sizable Microsoft sale was by Scott D.Oki, senior vice president of U.S. sales and marketing, whotrimmed his holdings by 50,000 shares, SEC filings show, orabout one-fifth of his stake. Mr. Oki declined to comment;Mr. Gates couldn't be reached.   First Boston Corp. analyst Charles Wolf has a &quot;buy&quot;recommendation on Apple but a &quot;hold&quot; recommendation onMicrosoft because of the latter's recent &quot;astronomical&quot; priceappreciation. Still, long-term, he said, the likelyworld-wide success of Windows 3.0 will make Microsoft &quot;themost compelling story of the 1990s.&quot;   Lawrence Bowman, portfolio manager of the Fidelity SelectTechnology and Select Computer mutual funds, is bullish onboth stocks, with different time frames. &quot;Everything atMicrosoft is hunky-dory, and it's full speed ahead,&quot; he said,&quot;but I wouldn't get aggressive buying at these levels.&quot;   At Apple, on the other hand, he said, &quot;in the next threemonths, there is no downside. The March quarter is going tobe extraordinary&quot; as sales of the company's higher-endcomputers come in stronger than expected. &quot;But there'slongterm risk in the stock,&quot; Mr. Bowman added.   Ultimately, the fact that Apple's Macintosh technology isnot the industry standard, and that Apple must bear theexpense of all its research and development costs itself,will either force the company to license competitive clonesor lose market share, he predicted.   ---   BULLISH ON THE BULL: One of the largest insider buysreported to the SEC this week was David Komansky's purchaseof 17,000 shares of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. for $17.38 each, or$295,460. Mr. Komansky is executive vice president of thebrokerage firm's equity division; the purchase increased hisholdings in the company by 19%, SEC filings show.   The purchase was made last Oct. 18, but appeared in SECrecords only recently. Mr. Komansky said he bought the sharesbecause Merrill and the securities industry are in a cyclicalbusiness, and were due for a rebound. &quot;To me, it justrepresented a hell of a good investment,&quot; he said. In NewYork Stock Exchange trading, Merrill shares closed yesterdayat $28.375.</TEXT></DOC>
