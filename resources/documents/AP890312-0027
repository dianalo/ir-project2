Just off the government's presses is ``The Fish List: FDA Guideto Acceptable Market Names for Food Fish Sold in InterstateCommerce,'' intended to end the confusion that arises because fishesswim under so many aliases.   The book assigns a market name to each fish from sea, stream orlake that is sold in America and gives the scientifically-acceptablecommon name for each. It also tells how the fish is known locally,often by different names in different places.   Fish dealers may sell their wares under either market name orcommon name, but none other.   What some people call the Boston mackerel and others call thecommon mackerel and still others know as the caballa, the bookletshows, are all one fish with the scientific Latin name Scomberscombrus.   Scomber scombrus may be sold simply as mackerel, its market name,or as Atlantic mackerel, its science-accepted common name.   The booklet lists 1,042 species, all fish sold for food in theUnited States.   But, admits fish list compiler Mary Snyder, assistant to thedirector of the Division of Regulatory Guidance at the Food and DrugAdministration, ``I have missed many. I get calls every day aboutfish that aren't on the list.''   Rockfish illustrate the name problem.   ``People in the mid-Atlantic area call striped bass rockfish,''said Mrs. Snyder.   ``To the rest of the country the rockfish is a completelydifferent fish,'' she said. ``It is related to ocean perch, which isa rough looking fish _ squatty and with rough scales and spiny fins.What we here in the Washington area call a rockfish is cigar-shaped,has stripes and is very different.''   The government has long required the marketing of fish underuniform, government-accepted names.   What's new is the guidebook. It was produced by the FDA and theCommerce Department's National Marine Fisheries Service because,Mrs. Snyder said, fish dealers who called for guidance sometimes gotinconsistent answers.   What ``The Fish List'' establishes is how species with deliciouscommercial names are sometimes known locally by names so unappealingthat anyone would be tempted to toss them back.   Take the fish known to science as the Lethrinus spp. Itscommercial name is emperor, but it is known in some places as thelongnosed pigfaced bream, elsewhere as the rosefaced pigface breamand in yet other places as the mu.   What is sold as the grunt is known in some places as the brownsweetlips. Some people call some anchovies the smig. Others call thegrenadier the rattail.   Uniform commercial names combat marketplace deception. About amonth ago, the government seized 45,672 pounds of frozen fishfillets imported from New Zealand. They arrived labeled orangeroughy, a tasty, expensive fish, when in fact they were merely thesmooth oreo dory, a cheaper fish.   The book lists 24 species of croaker, 38 of snapper, 18 of eel,62 of rockfish, 31 of grouper, 15 of grunt, 21 of anchovy, 34 ofshark, and 21 of mackerel _ including the jack mackerel, chubmackerel, king mackerel, snake mackerel and the Japanese scad, Incascad or rough scad. These scads are mackerels, no matter whatthey're called.   When the consumer buys flounder, he may be buying peacockflounder one time, tropical flounder another time _ or pantherflounder, Bering flounder, yellowtail flounder, Arctic flounder orany of 35 other species of flounder.   It doesn't matter, said Mrs. Snyder. They are so much alike intaste and appearance that the customer wouldn't know the difference.Only another flounder could tell one from another.</TEXT><TEXT>   The 50-page Fish List may be purchased for $2.75 from theSuperintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office,Washington, D.C. 20402.
