(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With Chrysler Corp. chief LeeIacocca at his side, Democrat Richard Gephardt on Monday defendedhis presidential campaign's ``$48,000 K-car'' televisionadvertisement, saying critics are missing the point.   And he suggested that Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis mightbe easing his opposition to Gephardt's tough trade legislation.   ``You may be seeing a battlefield conversion ... by the end ofthe week he may be supporting the Gephardt amendment,'' theMissouri congressman said of his Democratic presidential rival.   Gephardt said Dukakis told Michigan Democrats over the weekendthat he supported trade legislation by Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. ofMichigan _ which Gephardt said was the Senate counterpart to hisown bill.   However, there are differences between the proposals offered bythe two lawmakers. Gephardt's amendment targets ``excess andunwarranted'' trade surpluses for elimination without specificallygoing after trade barriers. Riegle's proposal, a compromise withcritics of the Gephardt amendment, directs the U.S. traderepresentative to secure the removal of unfair trade barriers.   Gephardt said he must win Michigan's caucuses Saturday to keephis campaign alive. He spent the day campaigning across the state,speaking to law students at the University of Michigan in AnnArbor, visiting a steel mill in Trenton and meeting with Iacocca inHighland Park.   He brushed aside suggestions that his K-car advertisementinaccurately claimed that the $10,000 Chrysler car would cost$48,000 in South Korea. Asked if the figure was correct, Iacoccasaid Gephardt has the point correct, whatever the details.   ``Close to it. Maybe it's only $35-40,000, but don't lose sightof it, it's still a big difference between $7,000 here for acomparable car,'' Iacocca told reporters outside the Chrysler Corp.headquarters near Detroit.   The Detroit Free Press reported Monday that a K-car would costabout $33,000 in Korea but that none is sold there. And Gephardt inan interview with the Detroit News admitted that many of thosetaxes are levied in Korea on domestic consumption.   Gephardt said the ad was designed to educate voters to theproblems created by foreign barriers to American products.   ``The Hyundai ad is simply to get them to see what we face,'' hesaid.   ``I'm told the ad is imperfect because they have enough taxes inSouth Korea so that a South Korean has to pay $29,000 forHyundai,'' Gephardt told 400 law students in Ann Arbor. ``Theydon't want their people to buy cars ... That's an export platform... We can't have those.''   Later on the campaign bus, Gephardt said the debate misses thepoint: `I really don't think it is South Koreans' interest to getinto this: Is it $38,000 or $48,000?''   At the Chrysler Corp. headquarters, Gephardt met privately withIacocca. At a outdoor news conference, both men said they talkedabout trade and not about an endorsement.   ``Dick's a good friend of mine and he knows what he's talkingabout on trade,'' Iacocca said.   Gephardt praised the corporate chief for his help on tradepolicy.   ``He was one who stood up for the Gephardt trade amendment onthe floor and said it would improve our trade policy,'' Gephardtsaid.   Gephardt said there was no delay in getting his trade amendmentthrough a congressional conference committee.   ``This week we're going to send the offer back to the Senate.They sent up their bill. We're going to send them our bill ... Iwant to get the trade bill done and when it's done, it's going tobe a tough new trade policy along the lines of the Gephardtamendment,'' he said.   ``Every other Democratic candidate has been critical of theGephardt trade amendment. Gov. Dukakis has said it is dead,''Gephardt said. ``He agrees, I guess with the Wall Street Journaleditorial page, foreign business interests and the Reaganadministration, who all want to see the Gephardt Amendment dead.The Gephardt amendment is alive and well and we're going to passit.''   In the speech at the law school, where he was graduated,Gephardt discarded a prepared text in which he admitted hiscampaign is reeling.   ``Yes, we've had some setbacks. But the view from the canvas isquite an education. And what I've learned is that defeat is notbeing knocked down _ defeat is not getting back up,'' he said inhis prepared text. ``There's no quit in me and there's not quit inyou.''   Earlier, in Highland Park, Gephardt said: ``I'm going to do wellin Michigan. The people in Michigan are interested in someone whois really going to stand up on the trade issue. They know I'm thatcandidate ... Obviously I need a good result here.''</TEXT></DOC>
