(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A satellite circled Earth on amissile-hunting assignment today as part of research into aspaced-based defense system after passing its first tracking testwithin hours of soaring into orbit.   The 3-ton Delta Star payload rocketed into space Friday to begina monthslong mission during which it is to aim its sensors atseveral ground-based missile and space launches.   The research could help perfect the technology for detecting anddestroying enemy missiles within minutes after they leave theirlaunch pads.   The satellite passed its first trial within two hours afterliftoff when it successfully tracked the thrusting second stage ofits own Delta booster rocket after separation and during its fierydestruction in the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean.   ``We watched that burn with the sensors. We not only got thesecond stage burning, but we also got the re-entry and breakup,''said Air Force Col. Michael Rendine, program manager for theStrategic Defense Initiative Office. ``We had a perfect ride intospace, and the spacecraft is operating just like we expected itto.''   Researchers especially want to gather rocket exhaust dataagainst the background of the North Pole region, an area throughwhich attacking Soviet missiles would travel.   ``We'll observe a large number of booster rockets as well ascharacterize a number of backgrounds, such as the aurora borealis(northern lights),'' said Michael Griffin, director of technologyfor the Strategic Defense Initiative Office. ``We have to know whatrockets look like from space when they are launched from the groundagainst various environmental backgrounds.''   Rendine said the Delta Star experiment is part of the researchbeing done for the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars,program to develop a space-based missile defense system.   The satellite carried laser radar, seven video imaging cameras,and an infrared imager. A Laser Illumination Detection System wasdesigned to spot ground-based laser firings, a capability thatwould permit future satellites to take evasive action.   Using a 48-jet thruster aiming system, Delta Star has thecapability to maneuver into position to spot the blazing plume ofmissiles and rockets to be launched over the next several monthsfrom Cape Canaveral; Wallops Island, Va.; White Sands, N.M.; PokerFlats, Alaska; Barking Sands, Hawaii, and perhaps from Sovietlaunch sites.   Besides quickly locating a rocket plume, researchers want thesensors to gather information to help distinguish variousbackgrounds such as land, ocean, horizon, space, atmosphericeffects and the aurora borealis.   As envisioned by former President Reagan who proposed it in1983, the Stars Wars defense shield would include several hundredlarge orbiting platforms equipped with rockets and hundreds ofsupporting surveillance and tracking satellites.   But the program, on which $16 billion has been spent so far, hasmet with increasing resistance from a budget-minded Congress, andofficials have spoken in recent months of a modified or scaled-downsystem. President Bush has said he supports it, but hisadministration is reviewing other strategic systems as well.   Vice President Dan Quayle earlier this week endorsed a newversion of the program known as ``brilliant pebbles,'' citing itssmall size, comparatively low cost and fast schedule fordevelopment.   The ``brilliant pebbles'' technology would involve thousands ofsmall satellites that could home in on enemy missiles and destroythem by colliding with them.</TEXT></DOC>
