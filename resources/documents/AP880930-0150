The hunting season was to end at midnight Friday.   Officials said it would take a few weeks to count how manygators were bagged since Sept. 1 by the 238 hunters who wonlicenses by lottery, but they say the hunt went off without anymajor problems.   Original projections of about 75 percent of the maximum3,570-gator harvest seem accurate, officials said.   For Grant Dunaway, the season end will be a chance to lock uphis alligator processing plant and rest.   ``We've been going pretty much straight out all month. Now we'regoing to add everything up and see if it was worth it,'' saidDunaway, whose plant near Immokalee received about 180 alligators.   Hunters were preparing for their final assault on the state'swaterways to reach their 15-alligator quota before midnight. Alarge bull gator can fetch more than $1,000 in hide and meat.   Dennis David, head of alligator monitoring for the state Gameand Fresh Water Fish Commission, said hide prices on theinternational market have remained stable at $40 to $44 a foot, butthe hunt dropped local gator meat prices about 25 percent to $4 to$5 a pound.   Mike Jennings, a wildlife biologist for the game commission,said the hunt was intended to cut back on the surplus alligatorpopulation in a way that would allow an annual hunt.   He said the state would try to teach hunters a few more of thefine points, such as how to tag a gator and fill out paperwork.   ``I think we covered safety pretty well,'' he said. ``Thereweren't any significant injuries. People were generally cautious.''   A full study on the impact of the hunt on the state's estimated1 million alligators will be conducted, and new rules for nextyear's hunt could be adopted in January, David said.   Some possible revisions could be selecting new sites for thehunt and loosening regulations to allow people without permits totransport the gators to processing facilities, said David.   Most infractions against permit holders were minor, includinghunting outside designated boundaries and failing to properly tagthe catch, he said. Several poachers were caught.   ``But for the most part we're quite pleased with the way thehunt was handled,'' said David. ``We didn't have anyone bitten likepeople feared.''   Veteran trappers had warned that selecting applications randomlycould lead to injuries among novices. But most rookies hiredexperienced guides.   Gator hunting is not without its element of danger. Mostalligators are delivered to the processing plants still kicking,their mouths taped shut with duct tape.   Hunters, skimming marshes and canals by airboat, use flashlightsor headlamps to pinpoint the red eyes of the mostly submergedgators. They then try to bag them using harpoons, grappling hooks,bows and tethered arrows, or bang-sticks, devices that shoot acartridge on impact.   Several airboats capsized, but no injuries were reported, saidcommission spokesman John White.   State wildlife experts credit strong anti-poaching laws adoptedin 1970 as the main reason the alligator population has doubled inthe past two decades. The alligator was removed from the federalendangered species list in 1977.   In Lousiana, which opened its 17th annual 30-day season Sept.10, 23,800 gators were taken last year.   Texas, which resumed alligator hunts in 1984, issued permits for1,500 gators for the 16-day season that ended Sept. 18.</TEXT></DOC>
