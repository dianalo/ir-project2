In a statement read to reporters by Canadian Foreign MinisterJoe Clark, the seven leaders also said that recent moves by thewhite-led government to stop anti-apartheid groups from receivingfunds from foreign sources ``would place severe strain on therelations each of us has with South Africa.''   The statement on South Africa, issued separately from apolitical communique, also urged an end to the civil war in Angolaand called on South Africa to implement long-standing UnitedNations resolutions designed to grant independendce to Nabmibia, orSouth-West Africa.   The South African blacks, known as the Sharpville Six, wereconvicted of complicity in the 1984 mob killing in Sharpevilletownship of a black town councillor during riots provoked by a rentincrease.   There has been an international campaign seeking clemency forthe six _ five men and a woman _ who have been sentenced to hang.President P.W. Botha has rejected a clemency petition.   The six were not convicted of directly killing the councillor,but found guilty under the doctrine of common purpose, which heldthem responsible because they actively participated in the mobwhich killed him.   The statement omitted any reference to the most contentiousissue, the impositon of sanctions against South Africa by thewealthy western nations.   British Prime Minisiter Margaret Thatcher, whose country is amajor trading partner with South Africa, and other European nationshave refused to implement such tough measures.   Canada, the summit host, which has scant links with SouthAfrica, has for years beens sharply critical of the Britishattitude.   A British spokesman said, ``We have no problems with thisstatement at all.''   ``We declare our our abhorrence of apartheid, which must bereplaced through a process of genuine national negotiations by anonracial democracy,'' said the summit statement.   The leaders said they also ``express our urgent opinion'' on theother issues, including the Sharpeville Six.   ``All legal options available in South Africa should be used tosecure clemency for the Sharpeville Six,'' they said.</TEXT></DOC>
