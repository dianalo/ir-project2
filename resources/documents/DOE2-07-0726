It then discusses that judicature's stancewith regard to international law, inter alia: the European conventionon human rights and the law of the European community, especially witha view to transfrontier environmental pollution. Furthermore, the administrativeprocedure in matters of environmental law and its impact on the extentof judicial control is investigated. The author is critical of the legalprotection practised by the French courts of administration, since forinstance, merely a verification of lawfulness is regularly carried throughby the courts, leaving to the authorities a large scope of discretion.(HSCH).</TEXT></DOC>
