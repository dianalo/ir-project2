The Bank of Mexico said consumer prices rose 2.4 percent inJanuary, the lowest for that month since 1978, the governmentnewspaper El Nacional reported Friday.   The National Consumer Price Index rose by 0.9 percent the latterhalf of the month, the central bank said. Higher prices forservices, rents, telephones, medicines and automotive insurancerates spurred January inflation, it said.   Still, inflationary momentum has inched upward in recent months,with prices rising by 2.1 percent in December. The previous highestmonthly inflation rate was 3.1 percent in April.   The government froze wages, prices and the peso exchange rate inFebruary 1988 in a bid to curb inflation that reached a record 159.2percent in 1987.   Consumer prices rose by 51.7 percent last year under the plan.   The central bank, in its monthly publication, said an estimated$700 million in capital returned to the country last month.   It said investors were encouraged by a gradual peso currencydevaluation instituted on Jan. 1 and lower domestic interest rates.The devaluation has averaged one peso per day.   Analysts have said the government adopted the devaluation tothwart investor speculation that it was planning a major, one-timecurrency adjustment.   Mexico's international reserves plunged from $16 billion in Aprilto less than $10 billion by December, according to private estimates.   The run on reserves was attributed to fears of currencydevaluation, pre-payments of private sector foreign debts anddepressed revenues from oil, Mexico's leading export commodity.</TEXT></DOC>
