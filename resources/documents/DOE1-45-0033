The chemistry and biochemistry ofsulfur has long been a subject of research because of its integral rolein biological systems and because of its economic value in numerous naturaland synthetic forms. In recent years, the redox chemistry of volatilesulfur compounds in the environment has taken on a new significance dueto its involvement in the formation of atmospheric aerosols and theirimpact on acid precipitation, human health, and the radiation balanceof the atmosphere. As a result, a major focus of current research onthe sulfur cycle is the biochemistry and environmental chemistry of tracesulfur gases and the interaction between the biosphere and the atmosphere.The ultimate goal of this research is to assess the background levelsof sulfur upon which anthropogenic emissions are superimposed and todevelop mechanistic models for the chemical conversions which both biogenicand anthropogenic sulfur undergo after release into the environment.The symposium is organized into nine sessions. These sessions includebiogenic sulfur in marine waters and troposphere, ground water, gas phasereactions, microbial processes, heterogeneous reactions in the atmosphere,cycling in lakes and watersheds, and terrestrial emissions. Collectively,these sessions address the major portion of the biogeochemistry of sulfur.A total of 199 papers were indexed separately for inclusion in the EnergyData Base.</TEXT></DOC>
