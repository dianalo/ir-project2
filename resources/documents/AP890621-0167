Tuck, the undersecretary of energy.   He noted that electricity accounts for 37 percent of total U.S.energy use.   Tuck said it was ``inescapable'' that many more power plants willbe needed if the economy is to continue to grow at a reasonablerate, adding that utilities have balked at such construction becauseof the high cost and lack of public support. No new nuclear plantshave been ordered in the United States since 1978.   ``Considering all these factors, it is apparent that the nationmay have an electricity shortage on its hands in the not-too-distantfuture,'' Tuck said in remarks to an industry-sponsored symposium onnuclear reactors and U.S. energy security.   Tuck cited the case of Long Island's Shoreham nuclear powerstation, which New York state is planning to dismantle even thoughit recently gained a license to operate. The Energy Department istrying to block the move, arguing that Shoreham is needed as aregional energy source and a national symbol of nuclear power'sfuture.   Tuck said the Energy Department is eager to complete research anddevelopment on several new types of nuclear reactors designed to besafer and more reliable than the light-water reactors that have beenused in this country since the 1950s.   ``We at the Energy Department believe that nuclear energy, led bya new generation of advanced reactors, will have a role in avertinga possible electricity shortage,'' he said.   Tuck said a greater reliance on nuclear power also would helplimit the nation's dependence on foreign oil, although this isdisputed by many private analysts. They note that while nuclearpower's only non-military role is to generate electricity, oil-firedplant produce only about 5 percent of the nation's electricity.About two-thirds of the oil is used in cars and other vehicles.   Nuclear power plants generate about 20 percent of the electricitysupply.</TEXT></DOC>
