The wastecontains significant quantities of hazardous chemicals, which dictatesmeeting applicable requirements of RCRA and WAC 173-303. A cementitiousgrout matrix has been selected to immobilize the hazardous chemical andradioactive constituents in the waste. Preliminary testing has shownthat the hazardous and toxic nature of the waste is significantly mitigatedthrough immobilization in grout. The disposal system design takes intoaccount the features required to ensure compliance with RCRA, as wellas projected compliance with the long-term environmental protection requirementsoutlines previously. The components being used to ensure long-term protection,principally the gravel hydraulic barrier/diffusion break and the protectivebarrier, were chosen based on comparison with natural analogues. Disposalof a low-level, nonhazardous waste will be initiated in June 1988. Disposalof the higher activity hazardous wastes is currently scheduled to beginin fiscal year 1990. 1 fig., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
