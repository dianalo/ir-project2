But one senior official at the General Electric Co. unit said privately that the plan has been under consideration and that he couldn't understand why Kidder Peabody officially said it wasn't. He said that the plan has been discussed at meetings of senior officials and that the issue had been unresolved as of yesterday, when The Wall Street Journal story appeared.    In an announcement to employees yesterday, Kidder's chairman, Silas Cathcart and its president, Max Chapman, said &quot;at no time has Kidder Peabody considered placing professional trading or sales personnel on a four-day workweek.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
