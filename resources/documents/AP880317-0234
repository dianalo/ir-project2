(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Exiled television evangelist Jim Bakker isdreaming of attracting a new flock to a Christian retreat in theCalifornia desert, even as PTL, the ministry he left behind oneyear ago Saturday, struggles to survive.   PTL, under the control of a U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Columbia,continues to spend thousands of dollars a day more than it takes in.   The ministry's television network is in the middle of a ``Marchto Victory'' telethon with a goal of raising $4.2 million by April1 to meet expenses, and PTL is considering the sale of hundreds ofundeveloped acres at the Heritage USA theme park to pay creditors.   The woman Bakker admitted having sex with and paying money tokeep silent, Jessica Hahn, is living in the Playboy Mansion in LosAngeles. She is writing more of her story for Playboy magazine,spokesman Bill Farley said.   The man Bakker originally accused of using blackmail to causehis March 19 downfall at PTL, the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart, is dealingwith his own admitted sexual transgression that knocked him fromthe pulpit.   And the evangelist Bakker accused of stealing PTL, the Rev.Jerry Falwell, is back preaching at his Old Time Gospel Hour inVirginia.   Falwell, who led PTL for six months, said it's been a dismalyear. ``It was obviously the toughest year evangelicals have everfaced,'' he said. ``Credibility was gravely injured by the PTLscandal.''   The National Religious Broadcasters Association met inWashington last month to set stricter standards of moral andfinancial accountability.   ``It is going to take me years to say all that I have learnedthrough this,'' Bakker told The Charlotte Observer recently. ``AndI'm going to be a different minister. I'm going to be lessjudgmental.''   Bakker calls his proposed new promised land Heritage Springs andsays it would be a 1,600-acre complex that would be similar toHeritage USA outside Fort Mill, S.C. He says it would be located inthe California desert, but no specific plans have been made.   The boyish-looking minister, newly ordained by a little-knownOklahoma church, was used to preaching in a high-tech studio, hissermons carried via satellite.   The scene was very different last week when Bakker delivered hisfirst homily since heading west.   For 30 minutes, he preached to elderly retirees at a trailerpark beside the Salton Sea in a desolate stretch of desert south ofPalm Springs, where he and his wife, Tammy, live.   Tammy, who wept after introducing her husband to thecongregation in a tiny wooden chapel that doubles as a bingo hall,said it has been a hard year for them.   ``Some people will ask, `What have you learned in this last yearthat you could share? The thing that I have learned the most isthat when everything is gone and what you worked 25 years to buildhas crumbled to your feet, God doesn't change,'' Mrs. Bakker said.   And what of the evangelical empire Bakker began building in 1978?   The devout still travel to Fort Mill to vacation at the 500-acreHeritage USA, with its hotel, water park and stables. The cabletelevision network still uses Bakker's upbeat formula ofentertainment mixed with preaching, prayer lines and pledges.   But there are new faces and a new message: integrity and modesty.   David Clark, a former Christian Broadcasting Network executivewho was appointed PTL trustee by bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds,continually assures viewers the new guard isn't out for greed andglory.   ``The people here are living modestly and conservatively,'' hesaid on the show recently. ``There are no seven-figure salarieshere and there are no celebrities. We're willing to be accountableto you.''   An Internal Revenue Service report filed in bankruptcy courtsaid the Bakkers and their top aides received $14.6 million inexcessive compensation from 1984 to 1987.   A federal grand jury in Charlotte, N.C., is investigating Bakkerfor possible tax, wire and mail fraud.   Last week, Bakker fired his own salvo. He had a lawsuit filed inYork County against Roy Grutman, a New York attorney who used torepresent the ministry. Bakker is charging that Grutman tricked himinto resigning and turning the ministry over to Falwell.   The Bakkers, who are seeking more than $10,000 in damages, claimthey did not know Grutman also represented Falwell at the time headvised the Bakkers to step down.   The suit says Grutman told the Bakkers that Swaggart was headinga conspiracy to take over PTL.   Grutman said the allegations were ``utterly meritless.''   ``I think this is a publicity stunt by Bakker and his lawyers. Iwas never retained by Mr. Bakker. I was not his lawyer,'' Grutmansaid.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for weekend editions, March 19-20</NOTE></DOC>
