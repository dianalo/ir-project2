The dynodepulses are fed into a zero crossover time discriminator with upper andlower level energy selectors. Timing measurements were performed withthe XP2020(Q) photomultiplier and several scintillators, being smallNE111 cylinders, two different sizes of Pilot U conicals and BaF/sub2/ cylinders. The best time resolution of 100 +- 2 ps fwhm per detectorpair and /sup 60/Co has been obtained with the NE111 scintillators. Severalpositron lifetime spectrometers have been built with this timing system.The best time resolution measured with /sup 22/Na was 145 ps fwhm forthe NE111 scintillators. With BaF/sub 2/ scintillators, a resolutionof 162 ps fwhm could be obtained. A detailed description of the adjustingprocedure is given which ensures reproducibility of the resolutions withina few ps.</TEXT></DOC>
