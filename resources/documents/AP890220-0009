Baker III accusedIran of ``state-sponsored terrorism'' in the death threat againstnovelist Salman Rushdie.   ``The United States continues to oppose terrorism in all of itsforms, in particular state-sponsored terrorism,'' Baker said Sundayon the NBC-TV ``Meet the Press'' program.   Rushdie has said he did not intend to insult fellow Moslems inhis novel, ``The Satanic Verses.'' However, Iranian leader AyatollahRuhollah Khomeini on Sunday refused to accept the apology and saidRushdie still should be killed.   Baker's comments follow statements by President Bush in his firstweeks in office indicating the administration's desire to improverelations with Iran.   But Baker said in the interview, ``If Iran really is seriousabout rejoining the community of civilized nations, this is not thekind of behavior that leads to that.   ``This is behavior that is basically intolerable,'' he said.   Just back from meeting U.S. allies in Europe, Baker also said inthe wide-ranging interview that:   _U.S. and West German officials are not at odds over statementsby Chancellor Helmut Kohl that he cannot decide whether to supportthe modernization of NATO land-based nuclear missiles in Europeuntil after elections in 1990.   _The Bush administration is withholding immediate judgment of atentative Central American agreement to disband Nicaragua's Contraguerrillas in return for commitment by that nation's leftistSandinista government to hold free elections and stop meddling inthe affairs of its neighbors.   The United States will work with other members of the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization on nuclear force modernization, seekingto reach a consensus before a planned NATO summit in late May, Bakersaid.   ``I found no one during the course of this trip who did not feelthat we should ... maintain a land-based nuclear missile inEurope,'' Baker said.   He stressed that he had not expected a commitment on the issuefrom the West Germans, where popular opinion favors removal of allnuclear weapons.   ``We understand the delicateness of the issue from theirstandpoint,'' said Baker. ``There is no disagreement. We have ourview. ... I firmly believe that we will be able to work this outsatisfactorily between now and the end of May.''   Notwithstanding the Central American agreement, said Baker, ``Wehave at the very least a moral obligation to seek humanitarian aidfor the Contras when it expires on March 31, and I believe thatPresident Bush has indicated that he would be doing so.   ``There are some elements to the agreement that look promising,the idea of democratization in Nicaragua, the idea ofnon-interference by Nicaragua in the affairs of its neighbors. Butof course these are promises that Nicaragua has made before,'' saidBaker.   ``There needs to be ... some sort of enforcement mechanism tomake sure that the Sandinistas keep the promises they have alreadymade,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
