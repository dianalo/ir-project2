 In a sense, there isprobably a thread here between Entertainment Weekly's situation and what JimLennane would describe later abuot the way new companies could get startedsuccessfully.andP;  It took a loat of hard work and the ability to combat a fairamount of adversity, but perseverance and some fresh thinking about magazineproduction were able to overcome the obstacles.andM;An ongoing theme about size of company may be relevant here as well.andP;  WhenAtex's Agnes Imregh proclaimed that the future of newspapers lay in beingable to accommodate the complicated issues of zoning, even at the price of$95,000 per seat for a full system with pagination, few people in theaudience took that as a serious alternative.andP;  Whether these papers will beforced to pay Atex's price or else fail remains to be seen, as does Atex'sability to complete the project in a timely fashion--a concern we have hadsince its acquisition by Kodak.andM;Of course, Atex is serving a market segment that won't tolerate workaroundssuch as those devised at Entertainment Weekly, so we don't mean to imply thatthe same approach would work for both markets.andM;At the low end of the newspaper market, where off-the-shelf products arecapable of doing a satisfactory job for most newspapers, Mycro-Tek outlinedits approach to the integration question: puttng together the pieces in aturnkey system for people who don't want to be their own integrators.andO;Mycro-Tek supports both the PC and the Macintosh in some fashion.andP;  And it hasdeveloped some of its own software for the Macintosh as well as using QuarkXpress.andP;  Although it hasn't found a good solution to the way Xpress handles(mishandles?) file locking when multiple pages are involved, it is working onthat, hoping that its users will be tolerant until a good solution iscompleted.andM;Mycro-Tek may have an advantage in its size--it has remained small enough tokeep some of its entrepreneurial character--but it has a disadvantage in thatit must compete with mass-market products that do a lot of the same job for asignificantly lower price.andP;  It must keep serving well as an integrator and asa support resource, or it will be overwhelmed by the tide.andM;Those are some of the issues raised in the one-day session on newspapers andmagazines.andP;  Because of the unusual and interesting nature of theEntertainment Weekly story, we have devoted an unusually large amount ofspace to that presentation.andP;  Looking beyond the entertaining nature of theexperience, we see some real significance.andP;  Entertainment Weekly has takentoday's new technology on its own terms and built an organization suited tothose needs.andP;  The resulting operation has its own strengths and weaknesses,as has every other approach.andP;  How well it works over the long haul remains tobe seen, but it has provided us all with a useful lesson in the meantime.andM;Atex banks on zoningandM;Atex has always focused on the special needs of high-end publishers, and thatremains true.andP;  In fact, in the newspaper market, Atex may be squeezing backdeeper into the niche of large metropolitan dailies.andP;  Agnes Imregh, vicepresident of marketing and business development, gave a short tour of thatniche, with emphasis on tools for zoning.andM;Zoning (that is, offering separate editions for different geographic areas ofa city instead of a single city-wide edition) is a growing phenomenon.andP;  Largemetro papers have had to offer zoned editions to combat the growth of localsuburban papers that serve just one area.andP;  With zones, the large paper canoffer advertisers the same geographic targeting that they previously got onlywith a local suburban paper, with direct mail, or with cable TV.andM;With zoning comes complexity, however.andP;  Parts of the editorial andadvertising content appear in all zones.andP;  Other parts are peculiar to onezone or to several.andP;  As the number of zones increases (and it inevitablydoes), the paper is faced with a difficult management task.andP;  Keeping track ofwhich ads run in which editions and which zones can become a major problem.andO;There are also added complexities in the pressroom and mailroom.andM;Since single-zone ads are cheaper for the customer than city-wide ads, thezone-specific pages provide less revenue than the corresponding city-widepages would, although their prepress costs are just as high.andP;  The combinationof more complexity and more pages with lower revenue per page means thatwithout proper tools a publisher could see profits decline significantly as aresult of zoning.andM;Atex has spent much time analyzing this issue.andP;  The result is a set ofsoftware tools for managing the zoning process that are currently under testat the Boston Globe.andP;  Even though the system costs about $95,000 per user, itis cost-effective according to Imregh's calculations.andP;  (Agnes's claims werereceived somewhat skeptically by the audience.)andM;Atex is betting that its understanding of zoning and its tools for managingzoning will ensure its survival as a vendor to large metro papers.andO;Certainly, this is a niche that is safe from the desktop crowd.andM;Like many other traditional vendors, Atex will have to base its survival on acombination of unique software at relatively high prices, sold to arelatively small group of companies in a specialized area of publishing.andM;It is interesting to note that this software-based strategy does not dependon any of Kodak's technical expertise.andP;  It would be just as appropriate for asmall independent company as for a subsidiary of a huge industrial giant.andP;  Itappears that Atex probably derives its principal benefit from Kodak's deeppockets, but there is no sign here of advantages resulting from factors suchas Kodak's technology or its worldwide organization.andM;One question that hasn't been answered, though, is whether this hugeKodak/Atex operation can react fast enough and effectively enough to today'schanging requirements to provide the realistic market solutions that werecharacteristic of Atex in its early years.andP;  Its record in bringing to marketits Total Publishing Environment, with its Publication Production Node,doesn't bode well.andM;Integrating PCs and MacsandM;Specialized application software (such as Atex's zoning package) is one wayto offer a unique value to customers.andP;  Another way is to perform integrationwork that customers themselves could not be expected to manage.andP;  Mycro-Tekhas put a lot of energy into the latter, and Steve Gardner, marketingdirector, described the experience.andM;Mycro-Tek looked hard at both Macs and PCs in developing products.andP;  PCs offercost advantages.andP;  There is more software available, and the PC is good fortext.andP;  But the Mac has the better user interface, better graphics fewercompatibility problems and fewer competing operating system options.andM;Mycro-Tek decided it needed to be able to incorporate both types of machinesinto its systems.andP;  This decision brought with it a number of problems.andP;  Oneof the most serious ones was the lack of common development languages andutilities for software development on the two platforms.andP;  Mycro-Tek wasessentially forced to establish two different programming groups (one foreach platform), though this reduced flexibility and created managementheadaches.andP;  Gradually, however, the company has been able to bridge the twoplatforms with common high-level development and prototyping tools.andM;The result of this effort has been integrated mixed-platform newspapersystems with PCs for editorial and classified ad-taking and Macintoshes forpage make-up and display ad creation.andP;  (There has, however, been anadditional load placed on support staff, who must now be able to troubleshootin both environments.)andM;An end user, Gardner contends, could not hope to achieve this type of PC/Macintegration alone.andP;  In practice, about all a publisher could hope for wouldbe a modest level of integration among Macs and among PCs, along with amechanism for exchanging files between the two platforms.andP;  Thus Mycro-Tek,though dealing with standard platforms, has added value in the way it tiesthem together.andM;Do-it-yourself off the shelfandM;Entertainment Weekly.andP;  The best example of both the advantages anddisadvantages of doing it yourself was presented by Tamara Westmark ofEntertainment Weekly, a new magazine from Time Inc.andP;  She had to go fromnothing to a full editorial, design and production operation (60 pages eachweek) in five months, and she chose to do it by combining off-the-shelfhardware and software.andM;She chose a network of 70 Macintoshes (all Mac IIcx models with 80-MB harddisks).andP;  Other hardware included 14 Apple LaserWriter IINTX printers, a QMSColorscript 100 (for color proofs), two Linotype L300s (possibly forhigh-resolution output, but not used that way--see below), three scanners(sharp for opaque color, Nikon for slides, Apple for monochrome), and a 3Comnetwork with four file servers.andP;  The Macs had different monitors depending onjob titles: Radious two-page color for art and design, Apple two-pagemonochrome for editors, Apple portrait for writers, and Apple 12&quot; monochromefor assistants.andM;The software included Quark Xpress for page design and layout and MicrosoftWord for writing and editing.andP;  Aldus FreeHand, Adobe Illustrator and LetrasetColorStudio were selected for graphics.andP;  Total cost of the system: about $1.5 million, including software and training.andM;Final output of pages is done through a service bureau with a Scitex system.andO;All final color scans are done on the Scitex system, as are all trapping oftints and similar printing-related steps.andP;  Westmark said the magazine doesnot use Visionary software: it uses ordinary Quark Xpress, and gets the pagesinto the Scitex system via the Visionary PostScript Interpreter.andP;  Thisapproach has several advantages, including the ability to use non-Bitstreamfonts without compatibility problems.andP;  Since all elements of the page areoutput via the Scitex system, the in-house L300s end up being used asproofing devices.andM;Rethinking relationship.andP;  The most interesting aspect of the EntertainmentWeekly project is that they did not attempt to replicate a traditional Atexmagazine editorial/production system using desktop technology.andP;  Rather, theystarted with a clean piece of paper and rethought job functions andresponsibilities in light of what is now possible with new technology.andM;Because this was a startup situation, jobs could be defined according toneed, resulting in a more egalitarian staffing situation with no production&quot;mop-up&quot; jobs.andP;  Designers, writers and editors see their material through tothe final page.andP;  (On the other hand, the temptation to make last-minutechanges on finished pages has created some problems.)andP;  Two peope (who alsohave other responsibilities) handle system support and backup.andP;  There is nofull-time system manager.andM;Text can be written before or after the design is finished.andP;  The text ispoured into the layout in Xpress, and editing to fit is done in Xpress.andO;(Designers do the pouring, but editors will be trained to do it.)andP;  Type isprestyled in Word, and the typography carries over to Xpress.andP;  An associateeditor checks the final page.andM;Graphics are scanned at 72 dpi, for design work and to give the outsideservice bureau a position-only image.andP;  Final art is added at the servicebureau.andM;In essence, the objective has been to streamline the organizaton andconcentrate decision making so that fewer people are involved in theproduction of each page and those who are involved have more control over thefinal results.andP;  (Something that is much easier to accomplish when everyonewho needs to can work in WYSIWYG form.)andM;There are, however, some limitations.andP;  The most important of these is thatthe system does not provide the type of file management and copy-routingtools found in the Atex systems used by other Time Inc. publications.andO;Entertainment Weekly has decided not to route files from folder to folder(which could result in copying them from one server to another), but to keepthem in the folder where they were created.andM;It handles file routing and file protection through a manual file managementscheme called &quot;conch control.&quot;andP;  For each story, there is a manila foldercalled the &quot;conch&quot;.andP;  Only the person who has that folder is allowed to changethe file.andP;  (The term &quot;conch&quot; comes from the William Golding novel Lord of theFlies, in which a conch shell is used to do bring order to group meetings.andO;Only the person with the conch can speak.)andM;Westmark noted many items that are not currently available in a system ofthis kind.andP;  The file management system should do what the conch does.andO;File-locking should be implemented.andP;  There should also be:andM;* Searchable fields of status information about each file.andM;* A way to tell who has a file.andM;* A way to identify the most recent version of a file and ensure that otherversions are not used by mistake.andM;* A way to handle non-printing comments throughout the process.andM;* A mechanism for searching for a file across multiple file servers.andM;* Integration of word processing with page design (bridging the gap betweenQuark and Word).andM;These missing items, we note, are exactly the reasons why people still buyprofessional publishing systems for some applications.andP;  But the experience ofEntertainment Weekly proves that serious publishing can be done without them,if the will is there.andP;  The total cost of this system (about $14,000 per userfor a full editorial/pagination system) significantly lowered the startupcosts of the new publication (which, in turn, helped to convince Timemanagement to go ahead with the venture).andP;  And, in spite of the primitivefile management, Entertainment Weekly editors and designers have been given alevel of control over and responsibility for the final product that theywould not have if they used a traditional system.andM;New York Times.andP;  The editorial graphics--maps, charts, tables anddiagrams--of the New York times are mostly produced on Macintoshes.andO;Typically, it publishes 30-40 such graphics a day.andP;  Gary Cosimini, theTimes's art director, described how this is being done.andM;There are 57 workstations networked together on LocalTalk.andP;  Proofs can beouput on numerous PostScript printers or on three high-resolutionimagesetters.andM;The company is starting to do a fair number of photographs through thisnetwork, too (but not in color: the Times is not yet a color newspaper).andP;  Thetime required to output photos on PostScript machines is a problem, butimprovements in the technology cut this time roughly in half each year, andeventually it will not be a bottleneck.andP;  For now, though, the Times needs anadditional Autologic APS-6 just for photos.andM;The Times runs its own wire service, which delivers Mac-compatible graphicsto subscribing papers at 9600 baud over phone lines.andP;  To add photos to thisservice looked at first like a job for satellites, but progress in imagecompression has changed that.andP;  With 20:1 compression, a 1-MB photo occupiesjust 50 KB--roughly a minute's transmission over a modem at 9600 baud.andM;A database package was needed to keep track of images.andP;  The Times found thatthe picture editors were able to develop one themselves that suited theirneeds, using Double Helix.andM;At the Times, the do-it-yourself approach has evidently worked well as adepartmental solution in the graphics area.andM;The NPAA project.andP;  A remarkable do-it-yourself publishing venture occurred atthe fall meeting of the National Press Photographers' Association.andP;  JohnCranfill of the Dallas Morning News described it at the seminar.andP;  The NPPAtook over part of an old inn on the island of Martha's Vineyard and, in thecourse of a day or two, turned it into a production facility for a colornewspaper.andP;  An actual paper, laden with color photos, was produced during themeetings.andM;The tools used were 14 Macintoshes, a Howtek color system, and a Linotronic500 imagesetter.andP;  Pictures were taken around Martha's Vineyard, mostly usingSony still-video cameras.andM;Pages were laid out in Quark Xpress and PageMaker.andP;  ColorStudio and PhotoShopwere used to adjust and separate them.andP;  Output on the L500 was painfully slow(more than two hours to output a set of separations for a single newspaperpage).andP;  Proofs were made from the negatives on the spot; they looked good,but when the pages were subsequently printed the color looked washed out.andM;Cranfill considers the experiment a great success.andP;  It is remarkable that somuch could be done in such a brief period.andP;  But the approach had itslimitations.andP;  The still-video cameras worked best under low-contrastconditions, but needed good lighting.andP;  (&quot;Good for late sports,&quot; Cranfillsuggested.)andP;  The project encountred speed problems evrywhere: disk drives,network and output recorded especially.andP;  Pagination turned out to be harderthan expected.andP;  And Cranfill worried over the ease of altering pictures: willthis lead to ethics problems?andM;The NPPA project had the support of a good technical staff.andP;  For example,when a virus shut down the Macintosh network, it was tracked down andeliminated quickly so that work could resume.andM;The examples of Entertainment Weekly, the New York Times and the NPPA projectshow the do-it-yourself solutions can work.andP;  They may have rough edges andlimitations, however, and they can require technical sophistication that notevery company has on staff.andM;Whither Crosfield?andP;  We had asked Crosfield to speak in this session, butbecause of organizational changes (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  13, p. 51) it withdrewat the last moment.andM;Archetype adds color, Bitstream fontsandM;Two significant additions to the Archetype Designer product were on display:Bitstream fonts and process color.andM;This was the first time we have seen release 2.2, which lets the user add(includee full process color photos within Designer for both ad and pagemake-up.andP;  It was being shown with the 16.8-million-color Vista board (24 bitsof color on the board, with 16 bits of color selectable from the screen),running under Windows on a '486 PC.andM;Archetype was capturing images with the Howtek scanner.andP;  For now, Designer2.2 can only crop and size the originals and place the photos onto pages; norotation of color images is currently supported directly within the program.andO;However, since Archetype follows standards closely and runs under Windows, ahost of off-the-shelf products can perform rotation as a preprocess beforeincluding the photos within the Archetype environment.andM;Archetype also announced that it has signed an OEM agreement with Bitstreamto use Bitstream fonts both within the make-up product and for output toPostScript typesetters.andP;  Bitstream fonts (including fonts in the Type 1format) can be uploaded to the screen or download into printers ortypesetters.andP;  This gives Designer true WYSIWYG operation from screen tooutput--a key for high-quality ad work.andM;In conjunction with this font move, Archetype has made it a bit easier toload font data and to solve the nagging problem of bringing set widths andkerning tables into the system.andP;  It has added a nice Windows application thatautomatically loads Bitstream fonts, inserts the proper widths for each fontin the Archetype tables, and updates the tracking and kerning tables for eachfont.andM;Finally, Archetype took the opportunity to announce that it has turned aprofit for th first time, on sales of $1.6 million for this past year.andO;Congratulations!andM;Atex lines Magazine, Design systemsandM;New items from Atex included a link between its PC Page Makeup system and itsDesign Software on the Macintosh, an IBM RT as a file server, and Archetype'scomposition program running in the file server.andP;  Overall, we were impressedwith the integration being demonstrated.andP;  It is now possible to design colorpages with a Macintosh, send page geometry to the PC system, create other,more standard layouts with the Archetype PC system, use Writer Software forediting and composing text against the layouts, and track the various stepsof the production process.andM;Because this was the first demonstration of the fully integrated system,we'll take this opportunity to review some of the system highlights,especially of the Design Software.andM;The Design system works in a similar fashion to other products, such as theLightspeed CLS.andP;  Text, graphic and tint areas are planned.andP;  The images arescanned at screen resolution for page planning, then scaled to their requiredsize.andP;  Text for headlines is created using Bitstream fonts, but the systemlacks composition, so all line endings in headlines have to be made by thedesigner.andM;In handling body text, the area is defined as a container, or linkedcontainers, and the size and typeface are defined to give an accuraterepresentation.andP;  In the headline text, manual kerning can be applied, butonly at screen resolution, so all kerning is in one-point increments--notreally acceptable.andP;  There are no automatic kerning tables.andM;Special effects can be applied to type, such as well-controlled and defineddrop shadows, where the position and color of the shadow is under usercontrol.andP;  Type can be colored, but only using CMYK color values, notPantone's color values, which is rather surprising for a color system, sincethe Pantone Matching System is a more common structure than CMYK in thedesign area.andM;Design Software contains some interesting color definition touches.andP;  A colorcan be pulled out of a scanned image with the eyedropper tool and insertedinto an area of type or tint to get an exact color match to the scannedimage.andP;  This feature appears very attractive, but we anticipate it beinglimited in use because the color is taken from a low-resolution, uncorrectedcolor image.andP;  The differences between that image and the color prepresssystem's true-color high-resolution image make a correct match very unlikely.andM;Some other nice tools stand out within the system.andP;  Object levels can bepulled to the front, rather than sent from back to front or front to back.andO;Image rotation can be interactive or by command, and images can be made torepel text.andP;  Degradees can be created, but they can only be two-dimensional.andO;The system can take input of graphics from other systems in EPSF format andgenerate color comps using a PostScript color proofer such as the QMSColorScript.andM;Transferring page designs.andP;  When the page design is finished, it is sent tothe system's Unix file server, which at the Seminars was an IBM RT.andP;  (Atexsaid that it will offer the new IBM R6000 system as the file server in orderto enhance performance.)andM;The goemetry that is taken across defines areas or containers for text andimages.andP;  Headlines are taken across as shown on the Design system, anddefined color areas are taken across as CMYK values.andP;  The text containers arejust areas; none of the typeface or size definition of the Design Software isbrought across.andM;In addition to linking to the Atex Magazine System's page layout terminal(which uses Archetype software), the design can go directly to a high-endcolor system as page geometry through Handshake or StudioLink, as well as toAtex J11-based systems.andM;The Atex Magazine System has been enhanced with additions to the Atex Writersoftware, which can now handle production tracking.andP;  It does so by creatingan HST file, which is updated with the story status every time the story isamended.andP;  One can look at the HST file header to check story status at anytime.andM;The composition software for the system, which runs on the network server,has now been matched to the Archetype composition software in the page layoutterminal to give comparable hyphenation and line make-up results.andP;  In theWriter Software, which links to the network composition, a loose lineindicator now flags lines where the space exceeds the defined limit.andM;Designmaster also exhibited.andP;  Parent company Eastman Kodak also brought somenew features for its Designmaster system, which are discussed under Kodak.andM;CSE joins ranks of full-system suppliersandM;Compatible Systems Engineering used this occasion for the formal release ofthe composition program that enables it to offer complete editorial/layoutsystems.andP;  The company reported its first sale:  a 20-terminal configurationto be used to produce PC Week, which has been produced using an Atex system.andO;(See our next issue for details.)andP;  This sale alone should put CSE on the mapas a full-system vendor.andM;The composition program which was first demonstrated at ANPA last summer andhas been reported in these pages on several occasions in the past, istargeted at customers who are familiar with Atex systems.andP;  It supportssimilar definitions of &quot;modes&quot; to link typographic parameters with screenattributes (with the addition of an underscoring command).andP;  It uses a90,000-word dictionary for hyphenation and provides control over the numberof characters that must precede and follow a hyphen, etc.andM;One of its nicest features is user access to system variables (current pointsize, font, leading; deepest point in current file; and so on) and uservariables for use in writing complex formats.andP;  After a page has been laid outusing PageSpec, the composition program handamp;j's the file against the layout andreports how well it fits.andM;A few nice system features are available, including worklisting to automatesome steps of the composition and output processes, a page status report toshow if a story has been updated since the page was proof printed or if thestory hasn't been written yet, and a report generator to track output.andM;MacPage.andP;  CSE also showed MacPage, its Macintosh version of PageSpec, whichwe saw initially at Graph Expo and again at Folio last fall.andP;  It is expectedto be released later this month.andM;MacPage has some significant advantages over its PC counterpart, such as theability to handle irregular shapes, to display graphics, and to rotateelements.andP;  Irregular runarounds are created by drawing a thread for text tofollow.andM;Other features include support for EPS files, laying out two-page spreadswith elements crossing the center gutter, save/keys, and jumping stories fromone page to another.andM;The user can specify the bounds between text sizes that are displayed as textand sizes that are greeked.andP;  There is also a mixed mode that displays certaingalleys as text and background columns greeked.andM;MacPage doesn't run the composition program in the Macintosh, but changes topage geometry can be sent back to the system for handamp;j, after which they can bedisplayed on the Mac screen.andM;One feature we particularly like is the ability to halt the redisplay at anytime.andP;  For example, if there is an error in the format or if the operatorsuddenly wants to make a change, the display can be halted instantly, ratherthan having to proceed needlessly.andM;Digital Technology refines AdSpeedandM;We recently ran an in-depth view of Digital Technology International and itsUtah Journal newspaper (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  12).andP;  However, in that report wedidn't cover DTI's latest additions to its make-up products, which weredemonstrated for the first time at the Seminars.andM;AdSpeed 2.0 is currently in beta testing at eh Journal.andP;  It is scheduled foran April release.andM;There were three goals for the new release: adding features to increaseproductivity, closing the gap on the &quot;100% case&quot; (the ability to make up 100%of the ads any newspaper requires), and simplifying the product and making itfriendlier.andM;DTI has added several features to achieve these goals.andP;  An interactive,on-screen (non-WYSIWYG) editor window makes choosing the next block of copyto be placed onto an ad easier and more selective.andP;  Many improvements havebeen added to the editor itself--including keyboard shortcuts that make itsurprisingly similar to XyWrite on a Macintosh (define and operate modes).andM;More parameter changes are now allowed within a single measure.andP;  A graphicattribute window has been added to handle such functions as rotation bynumber, position of elements and border information.andP;  Save/get keys have beenadded to store often-used text strings; they can store some predefinedfunctions as well, but not the entire list of typographic commands.andP;  Theirprimary purpose is for text.andM;A floating toolbox has been added--a big help for people using largemonitors.andP;  The toolbox itself has been beefed up with a host of functionsthat can be applied immediately to selected items.andP;  Many keystrokeaccelerators have also been added to help productivity.andM;In general, we found many features that were simply streamlined to make thejob of make-up faster and easier.andP;  Selection has also improved, especiallywhen items are layered on top of each other--the program now cycles throughall possible combinations, greatly reducing the user's frustration.andM;A big help on the system side is the ability to access the file managementsystem directly from within the program.andP;  This ability to access folders andfiles without exiting the program would help a lot of Mac-based programs.andM;Overall, DTI's software is much more Mac-like, which removes a criticism wehad when we first reviewed it.andM;DRG shows WYSIWYG TomahawkandM;Deucalion Resources Group, the Ann Arbor-based developer of a compositionengine called Tomahawk, demonstrated some new members of its &quot;hawk&quot; family:the Mohawk editor and the Hawkeye WYSIWYG display.andP;  DRG shared the space withCText, its best-known Tomahawk customer.andP;  CText showed the current version ofits Dateline system, which is based on Tomahawk composition and is creepingcloser to going live at the Chicago Tribune.andP;  Actually, it is expected to golive in Newport News (early in May) before Chicago.andM;The biggest news was the WYSIWYG display for Tomahawk.andP;  Because Tomahawk is amodule that can be incorporated into systems being developed by othervendors, it is highly customizable and could have its display and otherfeatures implemented in a variety of ways.andP;  What we saw was one possibleimplementation.andP;  As expected, the system was running under OS/2 andPresentation Manager, although support for other environments is planned(possibly DECwindows and the macintosh System 7).andM;Hawkeye, the display routine, generates true fonts and sizes, actualpositioning (including the effects of kerning), magnifications from 10% to800%, and multiple linked or unlinked views of the same job, which allowsusers to view part of a job at a larger size than the rest of the job.andP;  DRGsaid that it is doing its own screen building, but that later it will useApple's TrueType or Adobe's Display PostScript facilities.andP;  It is working ondisplay of graphics.andM;The screen can be split to show a WYSIWYG view in one window and a file withembedded, editable commands in another window, plus a third window forreporting errors, such as invalid commands.andP;  Text can be edited interactivelyin the WYSIWYG window or in the command window.andP;  When the same file isdisplayed in both WYSIWYG and monospaced formats, the cursor tracks the otherscreen during editing.andM;Pull-down menus are available for embedding markup codes.andM;Mohawk, the editing program, supports customizable keyboard layouts, editingfeatures and character display.andP;  User-defined routines can be assigned tokeys and accessed to recall text, perform mathematical calculations, and soon.andP;  Other features include define-operate block functions, extensivesearch/replace, capable cursor movement and scrolling, and &quot;slewing&quot; tomodify commands such as sizes and leading with a single keystroke.andM;It doesn't contain a built-in spelling checker or thesaurus, but these couldbe added by a developer or system integrator.andM;The user can control the procedure for updating the screen as editing changesare made--such as preventing updating of the WYSIWYG display entirely orspecifying that no recomposition and redisplay begin until there is auser-definable break in keyboard activity.andP;  If further editing is initiatedwhile recomposition and redisplay are in progress, those processes will behalted and resumed later at the point where the new change was made, thussaving the long delays commonly experienced on systems that insist onrecomposing files even when further changes are being made.andM;Another means of saving time is to perform editing in the monospaced textwindow and wait to recompose the file until all changes have been made.andM;Dycam brings still camera prototypeandM;One of the newest companies at the Seminars was Dycam, which brought itsportable digital still camera.andP;  This exhibit exemplified the original spiritof the New Products Showcase: a new company showing an early prototype of aproduct that breaks new ground.andM;This very light (eight ounces) pure digital camera differs from mostcompeting products in that it need not &quot;grab&quot; an image frame to bring it intothe system.andP;  It connects to the computer (initially a Macintosh and later aPC) via a high-speed serial connection.andM;The camera contains enough memory to hold up to 32 images.andP;  For remoteoperations, Dycam suggests linking it with a portable PC.andP;  Images aremaintained in memory as long as there is power in the rechargeable batteries.andO;Image quality appears acceptable for small images: the resolution is376X240X8-bit pixels (256 gray levels), which Dycam plans to increase.andM;In addition to being light, the camera is also small and easy to use.andP;  It hasan electronic shutter with a speed of 1/30-1/2,000 of a second.andP;  A built-inflash links with the automatic exposure control in much the same way as manypoint-and-shoot cameras in use today.andM;The Dycam system is in prototype form and is being readied for tooling.andO;Samples are planned for the summer, and production quantities are planned forthe fall.andP;  The list price, including input and edit software for theMacintosh and later the PC, is expected to be $895.andM;Kodak shows Designmaster additionsandM;Kodak had a separate booth from Atex and concentrated on the Designmaterproduct line and a host of new interfaces and a new stripping station.andM;Two new products were introduced--a Designmaster Electronic Stripping Station(shown at the Seminars) and a new RIP (not shown).andP;  The idea of the newstripping station is to collect portions of pages from a variety of Kodak andexternal (non-Kodak) devices (including images from the Designmasterworkstations and page layouts from Atex products) and assemble them intocomplete electronic pages.andP;  In addition to pure assembly, the station canscale, position, choke, spread, and rotate all page elements.andP;  Line art canalso be scanned into the station and colored.andM;The station will be interfaced to a new high-speed RIP that creates imagefiles on the fly as it sends them to a recording engine.andP;  Since it doesn'tcreate a page file in advance of recording, it should minimize storage andpotentially increase output performance.andP;  We couldn't perform any timings onthe RIP; it wasn't demonstrated at the Seminars.andM;In addition to the new products, Kodak is now offering a series of newinterfaces to desktop publishing and the outside world.andP;  Three suchinterfaces are now available.andM;The first, Graphic Link I, is designed to interface with a Mac to bringillustrations created with programs such as Illustrator and FreeHand (andoutput via PostScript) into the Designmaster system via mag tape.andP;  GraphicLink I is a Mac-based software package that converts PostScript files into350- or 500-line-per-inch contone files using the standard CT2T 9-track tapeformat.andP;  The mag tape can be read directly by the Kodak Designmaster 8000 forcolor correction and retouching or by any other device capable of readingthis format (such as Crosfield or Scitex).andM;Another interface, Graphic Link II, offers a similar capability.andP;  A directlink from the Macs to the Designmaster stripping station, it brings theillustrations and layouts from packages such as Quark Xpress and PageMaker(including text) directly from the Mac into the stripping station via anEthernet link.andP;  The PostScript files are converted into the internal line artformat of the Designmaster in resolutions as high as 2,800 lines per inch.andM;The third interface, Graphic Link III, provides a similar capability forfiles originating on Kodak's own Graphic Design Software (the Media Solutionspackage from Atex).andP;  In this case, the native language objects are convertedinto the native object format of the stripping station, allowing furthermanipulation of all graphic components.andP;  Text is brought in as bitmaps,resulting in limited manipulations at the stripping station.andM;All three linking programs run on either the Mac II or the SE 30.andP;  Theyrequire 5 MB of RAM, 80 MB of disk storage and a high-resolution 19&quot; monitor.andM;Mycro-Tek leaps into Mac systemsandM;Mycro-Tek brought two new products to the Showcase--a new page make-up devicerunning on a Mac, called Mycro-Comp Page, and a new front-end system(editorial and classified) also running on Macs, called the series 2500system.andM;Editorial page make-up.andP;  Page is based on Quark Xpress.andP;  Mycro-Tek haswritten several Xtensions to tailor it to newspaper work, but the basicprogram is pure Xpress.andP;  The program has been linked to MycroTek's ownMycro-Comp front-end system (but not the new 2500 Mac-based product).andP;  It istied directly to the server, allowing the user to see the entire filestructure of the front end and to perform any function on those files fromhis Mac terminal (based on his security access).andM;The system is set up to have most copyfitting done on the front end.andP;  Copy isfit to assigned lengths since the program doesn't pass an exact story holeand geometry to the front end.andP;  For now, this is strictly a one-way interfacefrom Mycro-Tek to Quark.andP;  Final copyfitting will be done on the Page make-upprogram running on the Macs.andP;  When files are sent to the system's pagemake-up side, file names, desks and date stamps are shown in the Macdirectories (folders).andM;Mycro-Tek has used the powerful Xtensions to honor all the compositioncommands (and line endings) of its front end.andP;  This is even more critical aswe look at classified pagination.andP;  But in a typical editorial page make-upcycle, copy that has to be adjusted to fit the news hole will be re-handamp;j'ed bythe Quark composition routines.andM;Other Xtensions have been used to perform other typical newspaper functions.andO;The system now handles automatic square-offs of multiple columns of text (afunction missing from many high-end systems).andP;  It also performs jumps--itautomatically creates the &quot;continued to&quot; and &quot;continued from&quot; lines, and itcreates the new story file by extending the original story name with the pagenumber involved.andM;Thumbnails of groups of pages (such as an entire section) can be viewed invarying sizes.andP;  These are not soft typeset pages, but pages that can bemanipulated--regardless of size or zoom factor.andM;Another feature is the ability to print individual stories or otherindividual elements of any page easily.andP;  Special alignment tools added viathe Xtensions provide for spacing between display ads and stories, picturesand captions, etc.andM;Page has been undergoing beta testing and is nearly ready for release.andP;  Itwill cost $5,995, including Xpress.andP;  It requires 2 MB of memory, but 4 MB isrecommended.andM;Classified.andP;  The same program is being used for classified page make-up.andO;Critical to this application is the ability to honor the line endings fromthe front end.andP;  The front end determines the order and size of each &quot;galley&quot;sent to the make-up terminal.andP;  It places copy, galley by galley.andP;  Theoperator can't select the copy directly by classifications from the frontend.andP;  Galley are usually groups of classifications.andM;Galleys are manually flowed onto pages, one by one.andP;  The system providesback-to-front flowing, but no vertical justification.andP;  The user must addspacing between ads or add fillers to fill out columns.andM;Mycro-Tek uses its MasterPlanner program (originally designed for theplacement of display ads in ROP sections) for the initial placement ofclassified display ads.andP;  All multicolumn ads are placed via this program.andO;The operator can over-ride these decisions and manually move display ads toany location on any page.andM;MasterPlanner appears to be in its early stages.andP;  We would expect iteventually to offer vertical justification, automatic classification headersinserted at the top of columns and other automatic features that are presentin competing programs.andP;  For now, MasterPlanner offers a simple and fast, butmanual, way to flow in galleys of classified ads to make up entire classifiedsections--electronically.andM;Series 2500--classified.andP;  Mycro-Tek also showed its new 2500 front-endeditorial and classified system, a 100% Mac-based system designed for smallernewspapers.andP;  It was developed by Rockwell Computer Systems, whichdemonstrated it in an early version at ANPA last year.andP;  (See Vol.andP;  18, No.andO;19/20, pp.andP;  29-30.)andP;  Since then, changes have been made on a cooperativebasis between Mycro-Tek and Rockwell.andP;  It is based on the 4d databasefacilities supplied by Acius.andM;The classified system tracks ads via phone numbers, client names or accounts.andO;A nice search feature by &quot;fill-in-the-blank&quot; criteria makes finding adsrelatively simple.andM;This system employs the typical ad-taking form with excellent pop-up menusused to help prompt the user for information.andP;  Lists of classifications andrates are typical of the prompts used in this way.andP;  It also uses prompts withbasic information about ads (stereo, whitewalls, etc.) to help reduce typosand speed ad entry.andP;  Ads requiring minor mark-up with font, point size andstyle are also provided on prompts.andM;All copy is entered in a separate text window.andP;  No handamp;j is provided with thesystem.andP;  It will rate ads by word count or calculate size based on averagenumber of characters per line, which should be sufficient for smaller papers.andM;Like all modern systems, it has a calendar prompt to aid in scheduling ads.andO;This can accommodate multiple products, but the system can't deal with combosor any complicated combination rates.andP;  Most rates of this sort (such as aspecial price for Sunday ads) must be handled manually.andM;The system does track clients and thus their credit limits.andP;  There is norouting to separate queues or folders for credit problems--an immediateoverride by a supervisor is required to clear the ad into the system.andM;The system comes with both built-in reports, which should satisfy mostcustomers, and a report generator to create your own.andM;Series 2500--editorial.andP;  The Series 2500 editorial system uses a basicmonospaced editor that relies on Quark Xpress to perform all composition.andO;The editorial system itself provides estimates of story lengths (but no handamp;j).andO;We found the copy window rather small and a bit hard to read (something thatshould be relatively easy for Mycro-Tek to adjust).andP;  Most of the editingfunctions are handled in typical Macintosh fashion.andP;  This is a pure mouseeditor, not a keyboard program.andM;Stories can be tracked by story or wire number, classifications, priorities(wire), titles, date and word counts.andP;  Wire stories can be routed byclassification, but not by keyword.andM;The wire editor contains some nice facilities for sorting and displayingdirectories.andP;  Its Boolean search features are extensive, based on 4D'scapabilities, generating short or long directories of files.andP;  The searchcriteria setup can be saved for later use.andM;Calling up a file by clicking in directory mode brings up the story with theheader on the side--an interesting idea.andM;Automatic purging is supported.andM;As we mentioned above, Quark Xpress is an integral part of the system.andP;  It ismeant as the primary (only) composition engine.andP;  Therefore, we would expectmost users to make up pages with the system naturally from day one, althoughusers could simply create single-column galleys of type with Xpress.andM;All of this adds up to a new system that still has a ways to go, but thatshould satisfy the needs of smaller papers that would rather buy a Mac-basedsystem than the more typical PC systems on the market.andP;  It has neither thefeature set nor the refinement of the PC-based competition (or of DTI'seditorial product on a Mac), but the basics are there, and Xpress can make upfor a lot missing in the front end (such as handamp;j).andM;Mycro-Tek will sell the 2500 as software only or bundled with hardware.andO;Pricing was still being formalized at the Seminars, but we expect to see athree-Macintosh system with softwrae (either editorial or classified) forabout $15,000, not including training and support.andP;  Initial deliveries arescheduled for the end of April.andM;Publishing Technologies shows trial handamp;jandM;Publishing Technologies supplies remote-entry classified ad systems for thenewspaper industry.andP;  AdStar is a PC-based system for advertising agencies tocreate, specify and transmit ads, for subsequent translation into the hostnewspaper's specific markup code.andP;  It is now used in more than 250 end-usersites.andM;A Telecommunications Processor sits between the modem and any newspaperfront-end system to translate incoming data from the AdStar markup languageinto code appropriate to that front end system.andP;  AdStar conforms to thestandardized remote specifications as laid down in the ANPA/ANCAMspecification.andM;New to the product is the ability to trial-handamp;j ads.andP;  The trial featureenables the remote site to send an ad to the host for pricing and accountdetails.andP;  Now, the trialed file is returned in its handamp;j'ed form so that the adtaker can correct line breaks if necessary.andP;  This feature would beparticularly relevant where an ad includes a company name that the clientmight not want broken.andM;Also new is the ability to specify display ad space in the ad booking form.andO;Although the system is currently code driven, Publishing Technologies isworking with the Chicago Tribune to develop a means of handling remotedisplay ads, which it hopes will be ready in time for the ANPA show in LasVegas this June.andP;  The package would attach an AdStar file to anyPostScript-created data file and then transmit the lot to the newspaper.andP;  Theproject is still in its early stages, however; we look forward to seeing theproduct again in June.andM;SII brings early DTI linkandM;At ANPA in 1989, System Integrators announced its agreement to interface toDigital Technology International's ad and page make-up products.andP;  However,for SII customers, the database for all ads and their associated graphicswould be stored on the Tandem CPUs, under SII control.andM;Although there were no Tandems in its booth at the Showcase, SII was showingthe intial stages of what the user will see on the MAc-based make-upterminals.andP;  Until we see the system accessing data from Mac to Tandem it ispremature to discuss its operation.andP;  We will probably have a lot more todiscuss after ANPA.andM;Talbot tries to enter U.S.andM;We recently wrote a full article on the Mac-based Talbot editorial andclassified front-end systems and page make-up software (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andO;10).andP;  There was nothing at the Seminars that was not covered in that issue.andM;What was new was Talbot's effort to find a way to market its products in theU.S.--the primary reason for showing them in Boston.andP;  We didn't see anyvendors visiting the booth that are likely candidates for distribution--butwe weren't there very long.andP;  However, we did see a lot of Atesx and SII userswho seemed pretty impressed with what they saw and were asking a lot ofquestions about integrating their systems with Talbot's pagination software.andO;Could be interesting ....andO;</TEXT></DOC>
