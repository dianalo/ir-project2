Is Fined$545,000 by U.S. JudgeFor Plant Violations</HL><DD> 03/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BNENVIRONMENT (ENV)ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal regulators said a court fined Borden Inc. $545,000 for violating an agreement requiring air-pollution controls at a can-making plant in Lyons, N.Y.    The Environmental Protection Agency said the fine was ordered March 11 by a U.S. judge in Rochester, N.Y., for Borden's failure to &quot;adequately correct problems with the installation and operation of the necessary pollution control equipment,&quot; and for delays in applying for state approval to run the plant.    A Borden spokesman called the court order &quot;somewhat harsh&quot; and said the company is considering an appeal. Most of the fine stemmed from Borden's delay in seeking a state permit, he said. Borden said it would have applied sooner, but the pollution-control equipment was &quot;badly installed and didn't function well.&quot; The company waited until it was working properly before applying, the spokesman said.    New York-based Borden, which has interests in grocery, dairy and chemical products, sold the plant to C-B Foods Inc. in January 1986. The plant used a lacquer coating on food cans that, when baked dry, gave off substances regulated by the Clean Air Act. The EPA said Borden agreed to a consent judgment with the federal agency in December 1984. The EPA rejected Borden's claim that it had made a &quot;good-faith effort&quot; to fix problems at the plant. </TEXT></DOC>
