The currency fell nearly 2% against the Japanese yen yesterday and 1.4% against the West German mark.    Largely in reaction to the drop in the dollar, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 45.91 points, its seventh biggest one-day point decline ever. The currency's drop raised fears that foreign investors might be less inclined to buy U.S. stocks.    In the credit markets, prices of U.S. Treasury, corporate and municipal bonds also plunged as the dollar's decline renewed fears of inflation. Prices of 30-year Treasury issues fell nearly 1 1/2 points, or almost $15 for each $1,000 face amount.    Traders and economists said the dollar's performance was a delayed reaction to the unexpectedly wide U.S. trade deficit for June reported Friday as well as a response to the recent decline in oil prices and an apparent easing of tensions in the Persian Gulf.    &quot;The psychology has changed,&quot; Jack A. Kessler, a senior vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank, New York, said. &quot;The market has tried to buy dollars several times in the last few weeks and each time ran into the central banks,&quot; which intervened to stem the currency's advance.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8437 marks and 146.35 yen, compared with 1.8700 marks and 149.23 yen late Monday. The British pound rose 1.2% to $1.6140 from $1.5945 the day before.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 145.90 yen.    The dollar's fall propped up gold prices. Gold for August delivery rose $4.60 an ounce to $458.60 on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.7 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $459.65 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    Yesterday's dumping of dollars began in Far East trading as Japanese traders reacted to Monday's drop in oil prices. The movement accelerated in European and U.S. markets.    The steepness of the fall was produced by the market's failure to respond immediately to several recent bearish signs for the dollar, a failure that it apparently sought to make up for with a vengeance.    The Commerce Department said Friday that the U.S. trade deficit in June widened to $15.71 billion from a revised $14.04 billion a month earlier. Analysts had expected a much lower figure. The dollar fell substantially Friday and drifted lower Monday, but trading was light both days.    In addition, many dealers remembered they had sold dollars a month earlier on poor U.S. trade results, only to see the currency quickly recover.    The market psychology last week and Monday &quot;was that the dollar was quite stable at (around) 1.87 marks and 150 yen,&quot; Keith R. Baker, foreign exchange manager in London for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., said.    Traders attributed yesterday's drop partly to the unwinding of long, or overbought, dollar positions that had been steadily built up, particularly after last week's successful Treasury refunding.    &quot;The market bought dollars too much before the trade figures came out,&quot; Masakazu Miyamori, chief trader in New York for Japan's Sanwa Bank, said.    Mr. Baker said that when dealers moved to stem their losses by unwinding long positions, this triggered many &quot;stop-loss&quot; orders that customers had left with banks to buy or sell certain currencies at specific levels.    Roberto Bianchi, a vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich, said the dollar's drop also was accelerated when the currency fell through certain levels on charts that technical traders use to predict currency movements.    In addition, he said, some customers liquidated option positions they had with banks. Big banks increasingly are selling tailored foreign exchange options to corporate clients, and the larger volume of such contracts has given them a greater impact on exchange rates, Mr. Bianchi said.    For weeks, the dollar had found increasing support from Middle East tensions, the continued flow of foreign capital to U.S. markets, the relatively high price of oil and &quot;the relative strengthening of the U.S. economy,&quot; Jeff Mondschein, manager of foreign exchange for Merrill Lynch International in New York, said. &quot;Then it finally came through there's this huge trade deficit,&quot; he said.    When U.S. oil prices fell below $20 a barrel Monday for the first time in nearly two months, this tended to support the yen and mark against the dollar because of Japan's and West Germany's heavy dependence on imported oil -- which is priced in dollars.    &quot;Oil isn't always positive for the dollar, but it has a definite, unadulterated positive effect for the yen and mark when prices fall,&quot; Jeremy Hale, an international economist at Goldman Sachs International Corp. in London, said. He said the yen and mark also rose against the pound, which is &quot;an oil currency,&quot; even though sterling rose against the dollar.    Mr. Kessler of Chase said that although anxiety in the Persian Gulf remains at a high pitch, the potential crisis there is &quot;no longer on the front page&quot; every day.    Yesterday's currency trading was unusually heavy for an August day. Mr. Bianchi said Union Bank's dollar-Swiss franc business was the highest in six months. Even so, Kenneth De La Salle, foreign exchange manager for National Westminister Bank in London, said, &quot;It's not chaotic but steady movement.&quot;    There were brief rumors of central bank intervention to halt the dollar's slide -- at one point the currency fell as low as 145.65 yen and 1.8397 marks -- but dealers at big banks discounted them. They contended that a dollar-buying order of several hundred million dollars from a private customer was mistaken for central bank buying.    Several dealers said they expect central bankers to wait and watch before acting to smooth markets.    &quot;I think they have a view of what the extremities (the desired top and bottom of the dollar's trading range) are but will intervene to smooth the market,&quot; Mr. De La Salle said. He said that the dollar could fall to 140 yen and 1.75 marks but that the decline would be gradual and interrupted by central bank intervention. Many other dealers said they expect the dollar to trade in a range of 1.82 to 1.87 marks and 142 to 149 yen over the next few days.    A big question is how Japan's big institutional investors play the dollar's fall.    Keiji Tsuda, a vice president in New York for Nippon Life Insurance Co., said Japanese investors are eager to hedge their dollar-denominated portfolios.    But Robert A. Brusca, chief economist for the U.S. unit of Nikko Securities Co. in New York, said the dollar's fall &quot;happened too suddenly for anybody to go into a huge hedging program.&quot; He said Japanese institutions' holdings are so large that attempting to sell dollars in the forward market, where currencies are bought and sold for future delivery, would be self-defeating in that it would drive the currency even lower.    &quot;I've seen the dollar weather a couple of speculative attacks before and come back,&quot; Mr. Brusca said. But he conceded that the currency is like a boxer who's been knocked down several times: &quot;It takes more time to get back up again.&quot;    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Tuesday, Aug. 18, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
