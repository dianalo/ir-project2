John Richardson, the attorney general's ex-chief of staff, toldthe jury at Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial that as he sat inNorth's office at the National Security Council on Nov. 22, 1986,Meese aide William Bradford Reynolds ``gave me a nudge under thetable.''   Richardson said Reynolds then showed him a portion of a memo byNorth outlining a planned diversion of money from the Iran armssales to the Contra rebels.   ``I said something under my breath like, `Jeez, that's can'tbe,' and Brad shrugged and went back'' to what he was doing afterreturning the memo to the file, Richardson.   At the time, North aide Robert Earl was wandering in and out ofthe office.   Richardson and Reynolds ran into North as they went out to lunchand asked for files from 1985 on the Iran arms initiative.   North ``seemed surprised'' and said ``you should have themall,'' Richardson testified, adding that North told them, ``I willmake sure you have them'' by the time they returned from lunch.   Earl testified earlier this week that North spent that lunchhour picking up documents from his office pertaining to theIran-Contra affair and walked them to a shredder in the White HouseSituation Room, where national security crises are monitored.   North had destroyed so many documents the previous night thatthe shredder in his own office had broken, Earl told the U.S.District Court jury.   When Reynolds told Meese during lunch at a restaurant aboutNorth's diversion memo, the attorney general was ``very surprised''while Meese aide Charles Cooper remarked, ``You're kidding,''Richardson recalled.   After they returned to North's office to continue their reviewof documents on the Iran initiative, North told them that he wouldbe leaving the White House and back commanding a Marine battalionsoon.   ``Someone's going to have to take the hit for this'' armsinitiative by the Reagan administration to Iran, North said,according to Richardson.   The attorney general said he didn't tell North until the nextday about the other unfolding aspect that his aides had justuncovered: the diversion of funds to the Contras. Richardson, whotook notes at a Nov. 23, 1986 interview in Meese's office, recalledthat North showed ``a flash of surprise when mention was made ofthe diversion.''   North's attorneys, meanwhile, underscored their request forformer President Reagan's appearance at the trial.   Defense attorney Brendan Sullivan emphasized the misstatementsReagan made as word of the Iran arms initiative leaked out in earlyand mid-November 1986.   In cross-examining Cooper on the witness stand, Sullivan broughtout that Reagan on Nov. 6, 1986 had said there was no substance tonews reports of the Iran arms sales. Sullivan also mentioned a Nov.19, 1986 statement in which the president said he had not condonedarms shipments to Iran by the Israelis.   Reagan objected Wednesday to the possibility of having to appearat North's trial, saying through his lawyer that it hasn't beenshown his testimony is needed.   The Justice Department also objected to North's subpoena forReagan to appear, saying that ``any live testimony by a formerpresident is fraught with peril to the national security and tointernational relations.''   As Reagan made his objection, Cooper said the attorney general'saides never followed through with plans to interview Reagan about apossibly illegal November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles fromIsrael to Iran.   Reagan, who was eventually interviewed by the Tower Commissionon the matter, initially told the panel he had objected to theshipment.   But Reagan later stated that both he and White House chief ofstaff Donald Regan agreed they couldn't recall any meeting orconversation about the Hawk shipment.   North is accused of obstructing Congress by preparing a falsechronology that stated no one in the U.S. government knew untilJanuary 1986 that the November 1985 shipment contained arms.   The CIA had arranged for an agency-run airline to handle theshipment, which took place without prior presidential approval.Reagan signed a finding of approval after the weapons weredelivered.   Cooper said the fact-finding mission in November 1986 on theadministration's secret Iran arms initiative was ``overwhelmed''when North confirmed on Nov. 23, 1986, that money had been divertedto the Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
