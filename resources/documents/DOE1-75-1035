Thesoftware, described in a previous paper, automatically separates starsfrom extended objects and quasars from stars. This paper describes thequasar search techniques and discusses the results. The performance ofthe software is compared and calibrated with a plate taken in a regionof SA 57 that has been extensively surveyed by others using a varietyof techniques: the proposed automated software performs very well. Itis found that an eye search of the same plate is less complete than theautomated search: surveys that rely on eye searches suffer from incompletenessat least from a magnitude brighter than the plate limit. It is shownhow the complete automated analysis of a plate and computer simulationsare used to calibrate and understand the characteristics of the presentdata. 20 references.</TEXT></DOC>
