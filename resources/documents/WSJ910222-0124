Squeezed by growing competition and shrinking demand, bothat home and abroad, the U.S. company is now stung by briberyallegations against a Japanese joint venture of which it owns75%. Two employees of the venture, Yokogawa Medical SystemsLtd., are reportedly accused of paying off a Chiba Universityprofessor to get him to purchase medical diagnosticequipment. The two employees, as well as the professor, werearrested last week.</LP><TEXT>   Earlier this week, the Japanese government ordereduniversities and hospitals to &quot;temporarily&quot; stop doingbusiness with the GE joint venture, which had about 60billion yen ($456.4 million) in medical equipment sales herelast year, pending the outcome of the investigation. Theremaining 25% of the venture is owned by Yokogawa ElectricWorks Ltd.   Neither Yokogawa Medical nor Chiba University officialswould comment on the specific details of the Feb. 14 arrests,and the Tokyo District Prosecutor's office refuses to releaseany information.   But industry officials say the allegations come against abackdrop of a highly competitive medical equipment industrywhere about six companies are vying for market share. &quot;Thelevel of competition is such,&quot; says Steve Myers, a technologyanalyst with Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd., &quot;that after awhile all the companies end up looking like the patients --bloody.&quot;   In addition, the links in Japan between physicians andtheir suppliers, both of equipment and of medicine, have longbeen fraught with fraud, or at least questionable financialincentives. In a country where low-paid doctors make moneyfrom each pill they prescribe, &quot;it will be impossible toeradicate scandals unless the character of medical society ismodified,&quot; the Nihon Keizai Shimbun editorialized the dayafter the arrests broke. &quot;It is said that {doctors} take itquite naturally to be entertained from the suppliers ofmedical equipment and drugs,&quot; Japan's leading financialnewspaper continued.   GE has been a major player in Japan since 1886, when itsold equipment to a government-sponsored printing plant.Today, it is a leader in Japan in everything from nuclearpower plants to broadcast satellites to aircraft engines. Italso has been a world leader in the world-wide medicaldiagnostic business since it invented the modern X-ray tubein 1913.   But GE decided in 1982 to push harder in the Japanesemedical diagnostic business, leading to the Yokogawa venture.The venture makes lower-cost diagnostic equipment whiledistributing GE's pricier products, and has been a surprisingsuccess story of foreign technology breaking into theJapanese market. Yokogawa Medical says it now ranks third indiagnostic medical imaging equipment sales here, behindToshiba Corp. and Hitachi Ltd.   Yet at the same time GE has been pressing in Japan, theJapanese makers have been forcing it to sweat on its hometurf. Toshiba, for example, bought a leading U.S. maker ofMRI equipment in 1989, and its U.S. sales are growing 50% ayear. Such moves, and other market forces, have been forcingGE for the first time, to focus on cost cutting.   Meanwhile, the Japanese market hasn't proved terriblylucrative. &quot;The number of customers is relatively set, butpeople keep entering the market and everybody is trying tobuy share,&quot; says Jardine Fleming's Mr. Myers. &quot;No one ismaking a profit,&quot; adds an analyst at Yamaichi ResearchInstitute. &quot;It's common to sell for less than half the pricetag. So there is soil&quot; for scandal.   According to Japanese press reports, Sadao Uematsu, chiefradiologist and a professor at Chiba University, took a12-day trip to the U.S. in 1987 on Yokogawa's tab -- valuedat 1.54 million yen -- and got a total of 700,000 yen intraveler's checks from Yokogawa. The most recent paymentreportedly came when he took a trip to Europe in 1989.   Shortly after the last alleged payment, Chiba Universitybought a Yokogawa CT scanner for 230 million yen. YoshitakaKoike, Yokogawa's Tokyo branch manager, and Hideyuki Fukae,head of the company's Chiba office, were also arrested inconnection with the case.   A GE spokeswoman in Tokyo said that &quot;GE-Japan is not in aposition to say anything about this, it's a Yokogawa MedicalSystems issue.&quot; A Yokogawa spokesman said &quot;the details areunder investigation,&quot; but added that &quot;we will try to find outwhat caused this and exert efforts to prevent a recurrence.&quot;   A Chiba University official confirmed that Mr. Uematsu wasarrested but didn't offer any additional comment. None of thearrested men could be reached, nor could their attorneys beidentified.   It isn't clear whether the charges will spread. Anunidentified professor at a medical school in Yokohamasuddenly resigned his post this week, without giving aspecific reason, a school official said. The professor was onthe school's medical equipment selection committee, whichrecently commissioned some GE purchases, the official added.   Most analysts, however, played down the long-term effectson Yokogawa's business. &quot;For a while, it might be tough to dobusiness but that's it,&quot; said an analyst at Nikko ResearchCenter. &quot;It has a high level of technologies.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
