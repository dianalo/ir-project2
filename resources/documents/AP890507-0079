Damage estimates from the storms rose into the tens of millionsof dollars, and while some people went to church to give thanks forsurvival, others found their churches were barely standing.   ``I don't know what we'll do. I don't know if there's enoughleft to repair,'' J.T. Greene Jr., chairman of the FarmingtonBaptist Church board of deacons, said as he looked at the tatteredremains of his church in Davie County, N.C.   The steeple of the small church, built in 1878, was torn fromthe roof during a tornado Friday night and crashed into a vacanthouse next door. Part of the roof went with the steeple as itsplintered.   The twister was part of a strong storm system that swept acrossthe South on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.   Altogether, seven people were confirmed dead from floods orstorms in Texas, five in Virginia, five in North Carolina, three inLouisiana, two in South Carolina and one in Oklahoma. More than 100people were injured.   In the most recently reported fatality, Virginia state police onSunday recovered the body of Barry Joe Rice, 26, who was swept downthe Levisa River in Buchanan County after an accident Friday night.   Elsewhere in Virginia, the James River rose to 5 feet aboveflood stage Sunday afternoon, and several streets on the easternedge of downtown Richmond were closed by flooding.   In the yards of two riverfront cement companies, the tops ofphone booths and overturned garbage containers poked out fromswirling brown water. Officials said they did not expect the waterto reach low-lying areas of the city's business district.   The Rivianna River in Palmyra crested about 10 feet above floodlevels Saturday, and the Appomattox rose slightly above floodlevels Sunday morning.   The worst twister damage occurred in the Carolinas on Friday.   In Durham, N.C., on Sunday, members of Ebenezer Baptist Churchheld worship services in a nearby recreation center after the stormleft gaping holes in the roof and walls of their sanctuary.   ``The destruction has happened _ we can't do anything aboutthat,'' said the Rev. Henry L. Edmonds. He said the storm struckjust 90 minutes after the church day care program had closed forthe weekend.   ``I feel they were very fortunate not to have had anythingscheduled there at that time,'' Edmonds said. ``You don't need luckwhen you have the Lord.''   North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin toured Lincoln County, where someof the most severe damage was reported.   Martin said he requested federal assistance earlier Sunday, andthat Federal Emergency Management Administration officials inWashington agreed to send assessment teams to determine what kindof aid the state is eligible for.   Tom Ditt of the state Emergency Management Office said damageacross the state exceeded $28 million, while other estimates rangedfar higher.   About 74,000 Duke Power Co. customers were still without powerSunday morning as weary workers tried to repair lines that had beentorn to pieces in some places by winds gusting to 100 mph.   Ditt said teams in 17 North Carolina counties had reported 124homes destroyed, 171 seriously damaged and 671 that received somedamage. The storms also destroyed 42 businesses and seriouslydamaged 11 more, damaged 51 schools and churches and damaged ordestroyed 79 farm buildings across the state.   In South Carolina, Gov. Carroll Campbell toured the strickenarea in his state by helicopter Saturday and said he expects to askfor federal disaster relief assistance.   In hard-hit Spartanburg County, S.C., a spokeswoman for thecounty Emergency Preparedness Division estimated damage at about$1.5 million. The losses include 25 houses and 13 mobile homes,Debbie Rice said.   Ms. Rice said the estimate included only damage to buildings,not crop damage, damage to personal property or cleanup costs.Those estimates are still being prepared, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
