The panel, which will be charged with reviewing tradingprocedures and practices and recommending changes where necessary,is made up of five industry officials and five former or currentpublic officials, among them former Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri.   Earlier in the day, federal marshals sealed off the 16th floor ofthe downtown Everett Dirksen Federal Building _ which in the pasthas been used for grand jury testimony _ and U.S. Attorney AntonValukas, in keeping with office policy, declined even to confirmthat an investigation was under way.   Meanwhile, several defense attorneys who advised clients to passup government deals in exchange for cooperation complained ofhigh-pressure prosecution tactics Wednesday as a federal grand juryconvened to probe allegations of fraud in Chicago's financialfutures industry.   The complaints came a day after 200 subpoenas were served onprominent brokers, traders and firms in a sweeping escalation ofOperation Sourmash, a federal undercover investigation of corruptionat the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade,the world's largest futures exchanges.   Federal marshals sealed off the 16th floor of the downtownEverett Dirksen Federal Building _ which in the past has been usedfor grand jury testimony _ and U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas, inkeeping with office policy, declined even to confirm that aninvestigation was under way.   The investigation, conducted by undercover FBI agents posing astraders, reportedly centers on allegations that up to 100 brokersand traders cheated customers out of millions of dollars via shadydealings on the exchange floors.   A number of well-known defense attorneys in Chicago said they hadbeen retained by traders at the two exchanges, and that subpoenascarried return dates of Wednesday or Feb. 1.   Several attorneys complained that federal prosecutors, whoaccompanied FBI agents during late-night visits to some traders'homes last week, made veiled threats of confiscating property andother assets in hopes of enlisting the traders to cooperate, orprovide information about others.   ``If the idea was to make some people sweat, they've accomplishedthat,'' said a former federal prosecutor, who is now a defenseattorney and asked not be identified. ``But they might have gone toofar in some instances.   ``People are used to thinking in terms of a conspiracy ... crimesgoing up a ladder,'' said another attorney. ``What you really havehere appears to be a series of discreet acts that didn't stretchbeyond one or two people at a time.   ``Building conspiracy and racketeering cases, and threatening tothrow the book at people isn't going to make small catches anybigger.''   But Philip Parenti, a former federal prosecutor now in privatepractice, said the subpoenas may signal a different tack.   ``They might have run out of people they they can squeeze(information from) easily, and now they're looking for witnesses,not talkers.   ``From here on out, anybody who's got exposure and goes in to seethe grand jury is likely to be `immunized' or already has cut adeal,'' he said. ``And it seems too early for either of those thingsto have been done.''   Initial news reports panicked trading circles and spurred quicksales of seats on the two exchanges, but by Wednesday some of theclouds cast by the probe over the two exchanges had dispersed.   The exchanges reported sales of 32 full and associate seatsthrough midday Wednesday.   Board of Trade spokesman Mark Prout said a trend that saw thevalue of full seats slip steadily from $410,000 last Thursday to$375,000 Monday had ended with a standing bid Wednesday to purchasea seat at $383,000.   ``I'd be careful to read anything into this, especially at thisearly juncture,'' said Prout. ``There are many more things that canmove the markets than a pending investigation.''   Similarly, trading volume in the soybean pits at the Board ofTrade and the currency futures pits at the Merc, both apparentlytargeted by federal investigators, were consistent withbusiness-as-usual projections.   Andrew Yemma, a spokesman for the Chicago Merc, said volume inthe currency trading pits Tuesday, the last day for which fullfigures were available, totaled 143,698 contracts. That comparedwith 170,112 contracts traded Thursday and 111,284 traded Monday.   Prout said that trading in soybeans Tuesday totaled 37,223contracts Tuesday, compared to 46,463 contracts traded Thursday and32,313 traded Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
