Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., led more than a dozen GOP House members,armed with fire extinguishers and a bucket of water, to the steps ofthe Supreme Court, where television cameras were gathered to recorda rumored flag-burning by Gregory Lee Johnson.   ``You're not going to come to Capitol Hill and burn the UnitedStates flag,'' warned Rep. Larkin Smith, R-Miss.   The flag burning never occurred, so the lawmakers sprayed anddoused with water a stuffed dummy they called Johnson that was heldaloft by some anti-flag-burning protesters.   Johnson, whose 1984 flag-burning conviction was thrown out by theSupreme Court last month, held a news conference across the streetand said he never intended to burn a flag today.   ``I'm not going to, like fall into this silly trap,'' he said.   Earlier today, veterans groups testified in support ofcongressional action to restore penalties for desecrating the flag.Two of the groups said a constitutional amendment was the onlycourse of action, but one said it could also support regularlegislation if that would work.   ``Choose whatever course of action is best for our nation and ourflag and you will have the support of the Disabled AmericanVeterans,'' said John Heilman, the DAV's national legislativedirector.   Heilman's openness to a regular statute to address the courtruling was at odds with representatives of the American Legion andthe Veterans of Foreign Wars, who told a House Judiciarysubcommittee that nothing less than amendment to the Constitutionwould be satisfactory.   ``We must rally round our flag and pursue a constitutionalamendment prohibiting the physical desecration of that flag,'' saidH.F. ``Sparky'' Gierke, the Legion's national commander. A pollcommissioned by the Legion found 75 percent of American believe suchan amendment would not impinge on their constitutional rights, hesaid.   ``Freedom of expression can and should co-exist with a sense ofreverence for the flag and all that it means to Americans,'' JamesMagill, national legislative director of the VFW, told the civil andconstitutional rights subcommittee.   After four days of hearings, including two days of testimony fromlegal scholars, the House panel remained divided over how toovercome a Supreme Court decision on flag burning.   The liberal Democrats on the panel remain adamantly opposed to aconstitutional amendment and the Republicans vow to push it through.   ``The idea of a constitutional amendment has been damagedseverely in these hearings so far,'' subcommittee chairman DonEdwards, D-Calif., said Wednesday.   He and other Democrats said they were convinced by the experts toseek a regular statute over any amendment.   But senior committee Republican Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsinsaid, ``How can we enact a statute to ban such flag burnings ...which does not relate to the suppression of free expression? It's apuzzle to me how you can get around that.''   An unexpected argument against the political tide to reverse thehigh court ruling came Wednesday from Harvard University lawprofessor Charles Fried, who as President Reagan's solicitor generalwas the administration's chief advocate before the Supreme Court.   When the Texas flag-burning case came up before the court, Frieddeclined to advance an administration position _ a decision some saymay have made the difference in the court's 5-4 ruling.   Fried had been expected to tell the subcommittee that he didn'tfile then because he thought the Texas law and the federal code weredefective and could be fixed.   But Fried agreed with other witnesses, including rejected SupremeCourt nominee Robert Bork, that the arguments against a statute were``devastating.'' At the same time, he called on Congress to donothing _ enact no statute, no constitutional amendment.   ``Whatever the technicalities, the evident purpose of such astatute would still be to punish acts of expression,'' he said.   ``America, its traditions and values and its flag are important.But foremost among those values is the principle that no one shallbe punished for his political expressions _ no matter how offensiveor bizarre,'' he said, recalling his own childhood flight fromoppression in Czechoslovakia.   ``I hope and urge and pray that we will not act, that no statutebe passed and of course that the Constitution not be amended,'' hesaid.   Democrats told him that was no longer a viable political position_ the choice was only between a statute and an amendment.   But Fried told the lawmakers, ``There are times when you can earnyour rather inadequate salaries by just doing the right thing ...It's called leadership.''   Edwards told reporters he still planned to send to the full Housebefore the August recess a proposed statute, crafted based on theexpert testimony.   Sensenbrenner urged Edwards to send both the statute and aconstitutional amendment to the floor _ an approach already adoptedby Senate leaders.   ``It is the right thing to do,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
