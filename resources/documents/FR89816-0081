Machol.<ITAG tagnum="85">Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Petition To Reopen andModify Order </ITAG>Adolph Coors Company (``Coors''), has filed, on April 3, 1989, a ``Petitionto Modify Order'' (``Petition''), pursuant to section 5(b) of the FederalTrade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(b), and Section 2.51 of the Commission'sRules of Practice and Procedure, 16 CFR 2.51. The Petition asks the Commissionto reopen the proceeding and set aside the modified cease and desist orderentered by the Commission on February 4, 1975, in Docket No. 8845, 85 F.T.C.187, ``except insofar as the Order prohibits price fixing or resale pricemaintenance.'' Petition at 2. Specifically, Coors requests that the Commissionset aside in their entirety paragraphs 4(c), 5, 6, 7, 8, and 11 of theorder, which prohibit Coors from, among other things, imposing non-pricevertical restraints on distributors of Coors' beer products.\1\<NOTE/> In support of its request, Coors argues that the order modificationis warranted by changed conditions of law. Petition at 2-3. The Petitionwas placed on the public record for thirty days, pursuant to andSection;2.51(c) of the Commission's Rules, and one comment was received. For thereasons discussed below, the Commission has determined that Coors has notshown a changed condition of law requiring reopening the order but thatCoors has shown that granting the request, with one exception, would bein the public interest. The Commission has therefore reopened and modifiedthe order. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ In addition to prohibiting Coors from refusing to deliverbeer to distributors selling outside their designated territory, Paragraph7 of the order also prohibits Coors from refusing to deliver beer to distributorswho sell beer at prices, markups or profits lower than those approved byCoors. 85 F.T.C. at 189. <ITAG tagnum="84">I </ITAG>The Commission's complaint, issued on June 7, 1971, 83 F.T.C. 32, allegesthat Coors violated section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by, amongother things, fixing wholesale and retail prices, imposing territorialand customer restrictions on its distributors, and using unfair short-termtermination provisions in its contracts with distributors. Following extensiveevidentiary hearings, the Administrative Law Judge (``ALJ'') ordered thedismissal of the complaint against Coors. 83 F.T.C. at 174. On appeal fromthe ALJ's Initial Decision, the Commission substituted its findings forthose of the ALJ and issued its order on July 24, 1973. 83 F.T.C. at 211.The Commission condemned Coors' territorial restraints as <T3>per se</T3> unlawful because they were part of an unlawful resale pricemaintenance scheme. Coors appealed the Commission's order to the UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which upheld all of theprovisions of the Commission's order, except those dealing with the noticeand arbitration requirement in the event of a distributor's termination.The court also held that Coors' territorial restraints were themselves<T3>per se </T3>unlawful under <T3>United States</T3> v. <T3>Arnold, Schwinn andamp; Co., et al.,</T3> 388 U.S. 365 (1967). <T3>See Adolph Coors Company </T3>v. <T3>FTC,</T3> 497 F.2d 1178 (10th Cir. 1974), <T3>cert. denied,</T3> 419 U.S. 1105 (1975).Consequently, the Commission issued its final order on February 4, 1975.The order, among other things, prohibits Coors from engaging in wholesaleand retail price fixing, imposing certain non-price vertical restrictionson its distributors, including territorial restraints, and requiring exclusivedraught accounts. 85 F.T.C. 187. <ITAG tagnum="84">II</ITAG>Coors requests that the Commission reopen the proceeding and set asidein their entirety paragraphs 4(c), 5, 6, 7, 8, and 11, of the order. Paragraph4(c) of the order prohibits Coors from refusing to sell beer to any Coorsdistributor or terminating any Coors distributor because the distributorsold Coors beer to another distributor or retailer located outside of theterritory granted to the Coors distributor. 85 F.T.C. at 188. Paragraph5 prohibits Coors from restricting ``the territory in which or the personsto whom a distributor may sell Coors beer.'' \2\<NOTE/> <T3>id.</T3> at 189. Paragraph 6 prohibits Coors from allocating Coorsbeer among its distributors ``in times of beer shortage at the Coors brewery,''by any means not equitably related to their proportionate purchases ofCoors beer during ``the last three months before the allocation * * *.''<T3>Id.</T3> Paragraph 7 prohibits Coors from refusing to deliver all ofa distributor's order because the distributor made sales outside of hisassigned territory or because the distributor is selling Coors beer at``unapproved'' prices or markups. <T3>Id.</T3> Paragraph 8 of the order prohibits Coors from prohibitingits distributors from selling Coors beer for ``central warehouse delivery.''\3\<NOTE/> <T3>Id. </T3>Finally, paragraph 11 generally prohibits Coors from hindering,suppressing or eliminating competition between or among distributors orretailers handling Coors beer. <T3>Id.</T3> at 189-90.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\A proviso to paragraph 5 states, however, that the orderdoes not prohibit Coors from ``complying with the requirements of any statelaw.'' <T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Coors, however, is not prohibited from establishing refrigerationstandards for the central warehouses ``which are substantially similarto those established for distributors.'' 85 F.T.C. at 189.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Paragraph 1 of the order prohibits Coors from fixing theprices at which distributors sell Coors beer to retailers or the pricesat which retailers sell Coors beer to consumers. Paragraphs 2 and 3 ofthe order (prohibiting Coors from suggesting prices or mark-ups for itsdistributors) expired by their own terms in 1978. Subparagraphs 4 (a),(b) and (d) prohibit Coors from terminating any distributor because thedistributor either sold beer or advertised at prices different from thoseapproved by Coors, or because the distributor has distributed the productof another brewer. Paragraph 9 prohibits Coors from requiring that retailersserve Coors draught beer as their only light-colored draught beer. Paragraph10 prohibits Coors from requiring its distributors to eliminate or refrainfrom obtaining and handling rival brands of beer in order to become orremain a Coors distributor. 85 F.T.C. at 187-90. Coors does not seek relieffrom these remaining operative order provisions. Petition at 16.Coors argues that these provisons of the order, expecially in the contextof Coors' unique brewing method, and experience with the unauthorized distributionof its products in expansion markets, have ``placed Coors at a competitivedisadvantage and [have] been harmful.'' Petition at 9. Among other things,Coors beer distributors are required to maintain Coors' beer products inrefrigerated warehouses. Additionally, the distributors must monitor theage of their Coors inventory and are responsible for closely monitoringproduct shelf-life and ensuring that only fresh product is available toconsumers. Petition at 5. Coors believes that its ability to restrict itsdistributors' territories and impose other non-price vertical restraintsis necessary because such restrictions would allow Coors to (1) monitorbetter its distributors' performance, (2) provide incentives to distributorsto invest the resources and provide services necessary to comply with Coors'quality control requirements, and (3) compete better against other beerbrewers.Coors asserts that the relief it seeks is required by a change in law.Specifically, Coors argues that the order provisions it is asking the Commissionto set aside were predicated upon the <T3>Schwinn</T3> doctrine, which the Supreme Court overruled in <T3>Continental T.V., Inc.</T3> v.<T3> GTE-Sylvania, Inc.,</T3> 433 U.S. 36 (1977). Consequently, accordingto Coors, Coors' non-price vertical restraints ``were never put to * ** the `market power' analysis currently used in vertical, non-price restraintcases.'' Petition at 12. Coors asserts that it does not have sufficientmarket power \5\<NOTE/> to raise its prices significantly without materially andadversely affecting it business, and suggest that Coors' non-price verticalrestraints would be judged under a rule of reason analysis today.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Coors' national market share is less than eight percentand it no longer holds the leading position in any state. Petition at 4.<ITAG tagnum="84">III</ITAG>Section 5(b) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(b), provides that the Commissionshall reopen an order to consider whether it should be modified if therespondent ``makes a satisfactory showing that changed conditions of lawor fact'' require such modification. A satisfactory showing sufficientto require reopening is made when a request to reopen identifies significantchanges in circumstances and shows that the changes eliminate the needfor the order or make continued application of it inequitable or harmfulto competition. <T3>Louisiana-Pacific Corp.,</T3> Docket No. C-2956, Letter to John C.Hart (June 5, 1986), at 4.The Commission may also modify an order pursuant to Section 5(b) when,although changed circumstances would not require reopening, the Commissiondetermines that the public interest requires such action. Therefore, andSection;2.51 of the Commission's Rules of Practice invites respondents in petitionsto reopen to show how the public interest warrants the requested modification.In the case of a request for modification based on this latter ground,a petitioner must demonstrate as a threshold matter some affirmative needto modify the order. <T3>Damon Corp.,</T3> Docket No. C-2916, Letter to Joel E. Hoffman, Esq.(March 29, 1983), at 2. For example, it may be in the public interest tomodify an order ``to relieve any impediment to effective competition thatmay result from the order.'' <T3>Damon Corp.,</T3> Docket No. C-2916, 101 F.T.C. 689 (1983). If theshowing of need is made, the Commission will balance the reasons favoringthe requested modification against any reasons not to make the modification.Damon Letter at 2. The Commission will also consider whether the particularmodification sought is appropriate to remedy the identified harm.The language of section 5(b) plainly anticipates that the burden is onthe petitioner to make the requisite satisfactory showing. The petitionermust make a ``satisfactory showing'' of changed conditions to obtain reopeningof the order. The legislative history also makes it clear that the petitionerhas the burden of showing, other than by conclusory statements, why anorder should be modified.\6\<NOTE/> If the Commission determines that the petitioner has madethe required showing, the Commission must reopen the order to considerwhether modification is required and, if so, the nature and extent of themodification. The Commission is not required to reopen the order, however,if the petitioner fails to meet its burden of making the satisfactory showingrequired by the statute. The petitioner's burden is not a light one giventhe public interest in the finality of Commission orders. <T3>See Federated Department Stores, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Moitie</T3>, 425 U.S. 394 (1981) (strong public interest considerationssupport repose and finality). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The Commission may properly decline to reopen an orderif a request is ``merely conclusory or otherwise fails to set forth specificfacts demonstrating in detail the nature of the changed conditions andthe reasons why these changed conditions require the requested modificationof the order.'' S. Rep. No. 96-500, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 9-10 (1979).<ITAG tagnum="84">IV</ITAG>Based on the information provided by Coors, and other available information,the Commission has determined that Coors has not made a satisfactory showingthat changes in law require reopening the proceeding and setting asidethe order provisions prohibiting Coors from imposing upon its distributorscertain non-price vertical restraints, including territorial restrictions.However, the Commission has concluded that Coors has made a satisfactoryshowing that reopening the order and setting aside the non-price verticalrestraints provisions is in the public interest. The Commission's 1973 decision in this case, after finding that Coors engagedin unlawful resale price maintenance, called the territorial restraints``an obvious adjunct to Coors' efforts to control the prices at which itsdistributors and their retail accounts dispose of the product''. 83 F.T.C.at 192. Consequently, the Commission condemned Coors' territorial restraintsas <T3>per se </T3>unlawful because they were part of the unlawful RPM scheme,but determined that it was not necessary to conclude that the restrictionsin themselves were unlawful <T3>per se</T3>.\7\<NOTE/> The court of appeals held the restraints in themselves <T3>per se</T3> unlawful, citing <T3>Schwinn</T3>, albeit with substantial criticism. 497 F.2d 1178 at 1186-87.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The Commission noted that ``[a]s the Court in <T3>Schwinn </T3>recognized, whatever the status of vertical restrictionsunaccompanied by price-fixing, the presence of price-fixing as part andparcel of a system of territorial restrictions renders the entire packageillegal <T3>per se</T3>.'' <T3>Id.</T3> at 194. <T3>Sylvania</T3>, which was decided shortly after the Commission issuedthe final order in this case, recognized that exclusive territories andother non-price vertical restraints are not inherently anticompetitiveand must thus be judged under the rule of reason.\8\<NOTE/> <T3>Sylvania </T3>replaced the <T3>per se </T3>test for non-price vertical customer and territorial restraintsoutside RPM with a rule of reason test, but the Court did not change the<T3>per se </T3>rule for non-price vertical restraints that are part ofa RPM scheme. <T3>See Monsanto Co. </T3>v. <T3>Spray-Rite Service Corp.</T3>, 465 U.S. 752, 760, n. 6 (1984). <T3>Sylvania</T3>, therefore, is not a change in law as to the order inthis matter. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ <T3>See Beltone Electronics Corporation, </T3>100 F.T.C. 68 (1982).Although non-price vertical restraints are still <T3>per se</T3> unlawful as part of a RPM scheme, Coors does not requestelimination of the order's prohibitions on RPM. Therefore, any territorialor other non-price vertical restrictions imposed as part of a resale pricemaintenance scheme would be <T3>per se</T3> unlawful and would violate this order even if modifiedas Coors requests. The non-price provisions of the order, apart from theRPM provisions, are thus best viewed as fencing-in provisions, intendedto prevent the recurrence of research price fixing. Coors has shown thatthe benefits of those provisions, when viewed under the rule of reasonapproach in <T3>Sylvania,</T3> are outweighed by the costs they impose, and may nowbe set aside in the public interest.<ITAG tagnum="84">V</ITAG>Coors has made a threshold showing that the order provisions it requestsbe set aside impede and deter Coors (in states that do not permit or requireterritorial restrictions) from correcting impaired distribution problemsand from adopting efficiency-maximizing distribution arrangements thatwould intensify interbrand competition.\9\<NOTE/> These arrangements are available to Coors' competitors, andthese order provisions therefore injure Coors' ability to compete effectivelywith other breweries.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ For example, any steps Coors might take to increase distributoremphasis on providing a consistently fresh, quality product to the consumingpublic or to improve geographic market coverage may subject Coors to therisk of being accused of violating the order and, consequently, the riskof a civil penalty suit and judgment. By not being able to correct thesedistribution problems effectively, Coors is injured in its competitionwith other brewers. In fact, this order may injure Coors more than it wouldother brewers, because of Coors' unique brewing and distribution methods.<T3>See</T3> Bureau of Economics, Federal Trade Commission, <T3>The Brewing Industry </T3>at 111-13 (1978). Setting aside the non-price vertical restraints provisions of the orderwould enable Coors to employ distribution methods that likely would bereasonable under the rule of reason standard, because Coors lacks the necessarymarket power to raise its prices to supracompetitive levels. It would alsoallow Coors to take advantage of certain efficiencies in the distributionof its products, which, in turn, would promote interbrand competition.<T3>Sylvania, supra, </T3>at 54-55. Allowing Coors to use what it considers the most efficient and cost effectivedistribution of its products, including agreeing with distributors in certainstates to dedicate their sales efforts to designated geographic areas,would put Coors on an equal footing with other brewers and should makeCoors and its distributors more effective competitors. This is consistentwith the recognition that in competitive markets consensual non-price verticalarrangements can benefit both competition and the consumer. Coors' inabilityto impose non-price vertical restraints that its competitors are usingplaces Coors at a competitive disadvantage. Because of the competitivenature of the beer industry, the costs of the prohibitions on non-pricevertical restraints outweigh the continued need for these provisions. Thatbalancing therefore supports modifying the order in the public interest.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI</ITAG>With respect to Coors' request that the Commission set aside paragraph11 of the order, the Commission has concluded that that paragraph's generalprohibition against Coors ``[h]indering, suppressing or eliminating competition* * * between or among distributors * * *,'' 85 F.T.C. at 189-90, overlyrestrictive and broad. This language may have a chilling effect on Coors'ability to take advantage of certain efficiencies in the distribution ofits products. Moreover, in view of the current legal framework for analyzingvertical restraints, and the retention of the order's resale price maintenanceprohibitions, paragraph 11 is no longer necessary to fence-in Coors' conductconcerning non-price vertical restraints it may impose upon its distributors.Finally, the Commission has also concluded that Coors has not made a satisfactoryshowing that changed conditions of fact or law or the public interest requirethat the Commission set aside the part of paragraph 7 of the order thatconcerns conduct involving resale price maintenance. Setting aside thispart of paragraph 7 would be inconsistent with Coors' request that theCommission set aside ``the Order * * * except insofar as that Order prohibitsprice fixing or resale price maintenance.'' Petition at 3.\1\\0\<NOTE/> Additionally, retention of the resale price maintenance partof paragraph 7 is consistent with the primary objective of the order.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ Coors has not asked to be relieved from subparagraphs4 (a) and (b), which prohibit Coors from terminating a distributor becausethat distributor or its customers resell at other than approved prices.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII</ITAG>Accordingly, <T3>it is ordered</T3> That this matter be reopened and that the Commission'sorder in Docket No. 8845, issued on February 4, 1975, be, and it herebyis, modified, as of the date of service of this order, by setting asideparagraphs 4(c), 5, 6, 8, and 11, and by modifying paragraph 7 to read:<ITAG tagnum="21">7.
