<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-19-0724 </DOCNO><TEXT>Charge exchange reactions at intermediate energies are discussed. For(/sup 3/He,t) reactions a shift, changing with momentum transfer, ofthe quasielastic peak is observed relative to the electron scatteringdata. This shift is related to the shift of the {Delta}-peak in nuclei,also seen in (/sup 3/He,t) experiments. The (d,/sup 2/He) reaction witha tensor polarized beam is shown to be a very interesting probe of spincorrelations in nuclei, but also of the spin structure of the {Delta}excitation. Results from charge exchange reactions with heavy ions arebriefly discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
