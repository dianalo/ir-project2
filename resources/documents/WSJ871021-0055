The list of companies announcing buy-backs, which started mounting with last Friday's decline, exploded yesterday. Just a few of the companies boosting buy-back plans or starting new ones were Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Citicorp, the three major U.S. car makers, IC Industries Inc., Southwest Airlines, MCA Inc., McGraw Hill Inc., USX Corp., Honeywell Corp., ITT Corp., Allegis Corp., Centel Corp. and four regional Bell holding companies.    Meanwhile, some corporations canceled previously announced high-priced buybacks and others postponed leveraged-buyout and takeover bids to avoid paying higher-than-market prices for stock.    Those announcing buy-backs maintained that their shares were undervalued, and many hoped their actions would increase investor and employee confidence in their stocks. Also, though most companies didn't say so, the buy-back spree tended to prop up stock prices, even if some plans aren't actually completed. In addition, several companies boosted dividend payments. Wall Street executives said the rash of buy-backs helped spur the stock market rally late yesterday.    &quot;It looks like there's almost a get-together on the part of corporate America to prop up the market,&quot; said Stanley Abel, chairman of Abel/Noser Corp., a New York consulting firm specializing in buybacks.    Most companies said they would finance their buy-backs with cash in corporate coffers.    The market plunge gave companies an opportunity to &quot;create their own price/earnings ratios&quot; by reducing the number of shares outstanding, said Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs. &quot;They'll never be able to duplicate this in our lifetime. What better way of increasing the confidence level of shareholders?&quot;    Some of the buy-backs announced were large. GAF Corp., Wayne, N.J., a chemicals and building materials maker, said it would buy as many as seven million shares, or about 21%, of the company's common stock. The purchase could cost about $245 million, based on Monday's closing price of $35 a share. Chrysler Corp. said it would buy several million of its 212 million shares. As previously reported, IC Industries announced a restructuring plan that included buying $500 million to $1 billion of its common stock.    Ford Motor Co. accelerated its buy-back plans, Chairman Donald Petersen disclosed at a luncheon in New York. He wouldn't say how much the company had bought in recent days, but said Ford now may complete its purchase of 45 million shares by the end of the year under a program that started in November 1984. By June 30, 1987, the company had purchased 35.1 million shares, and now the shares have become an &quot;even better buy,&quot; he said.    National Distillers andamp; Chemical Corp., New York, said it would buy three million, or nearly 10%, of its 32.8 million shares for about $180 million, boosting a 540,000-share buy-back plan announced just the previous day. &quot;Obviously we believe the acquisition of shares at this time is an attractive investment,&quot; said Richard A. Tilghman, vice president, corporate relations.    A number of companies apparently had help deciding to jump on the buy-back bandwagon. Investment bankers at several large Wall Street firms said yesterday that they advised corporate clients to buy back stock or at least set aside funds to do so.    &quot;We've told all our bankers to be calling their clients and recommending stock buy-backs,&quot; said Jack Perkowski, head of investment banking at PaineWebber Inc. Other investment bankers understood to be urging clients to do buy back shares included First Boston Corp.; Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., Merrill Lynch and Co.; and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    For some frustrated executives, a buy-back seemed the only available revenge for a market plunge that amounted to a personal affront. &quot;My company was cut in half in terms of market value,&quot; said Roger M. King, chairman of King World Productions Inc., the syndicated television programming concern. Mr. King added: &quot;We take this very personally.&quot; The King family controls about 40% of the shares; Mr. King himself has a 10% stake.    King World in June announced a stock repurchase program at $28 a share that attracted limited investor interest as its stock rose, reaching a high of $33.25. Its board on Monday approved purchasing shares on the open market with cash and credit lines. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, King World closed at $16.25, down $1.50.    Ametek Inc., saying it will buy back an undetermined number of shares, described its executives as &quot;very disappointed&quot; at its stock price decline. &quot;It's dismaying to see this kind of thing happen,&quot; said Allen Kornfeld, chief financial officer of the Paoli, Pa., industrial manufacturer. &quot;We expected a correction, but this is all out of proportion.&quot;    Some companies, however, maintained their buy-backs were motivated simply by the numbers. &quot;Historically we have bought on weakness,&quot; said David J. Collard, vice president-finance, of Prime Computer Inc. of Natick, Mass. It reactivated a stock repurchase program that had been dormant for more than a year because the price of the company's shares had risen so high. The company said it will buy as many as 2.4 million shares, or 4.9% of the company'sshares outstanding.    Other companies maintained their plans had nothing to do with the market collapse. &quot;This isn't a program that was designed as a reaction to what happened in the market,&quot; said a spokesman for American Medical International Inc., which announced a buy-back of up to $150 million of common stock. &quot;It's just coincidental.&quot; Honeywell used the same word in discussing its buy-back.    But William Roper Jr., chief financial officer of San Antonio-based Intelogic Trace Inc., a computer-maintenance concern, said, &quot;You are sending a signal to the market, to customers, to employees&quot; with a buy-back now. Although he said that wasn't his company's primary intent, it announced plans to buy as many as one million of its 14.9 million common shares.    In some cases, employees and management themselves decided to take up the defense of their company stock. &quot;I'm putting my money where my mouth is,&quot; said Elias &quot;E.Z.&quot; Zinn, chairman of Houston-based Entertainment Marketing Inc., as his company's stock fell to $3.75 yesterday from a recent high of $16.25 in American Stock Exchange composite trading. Mr. Zinn announced that he personally would buy 500,000 shares, or about 4%, of Entertainment Marketing's 12.4 million shares outstanding. &quot;This isn't the company buying them. This is me, personally,&quot; he said.    Mr. Zinn said he mainly wants the chance to increase his 24.5% ownership of the company at a bargain price. He denies wishing to send any signals of confidence to his employees or investors. &quot;They know our market position,&quot; he said. &quot;They know our earnings projections. This company is selling at three times projected earnings. I know it's a tough market but this is ridiculous.&quot; He said other employees too are buying shares in the company.    Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons didn't waste any time enhancing his position in a company he already controls. Before the market's fall, Valhi Inc., his holding company, owned 51% of NL Industries Inc. common and 20% of NL's preferred. Mr. Simmons said he rolled into his office an hour early yesterday -- &quot;the first time I've been in the office at 8:30 in years&quot; -- to begin buying.    One target was NL Industries preferred, which was trading well below the $15.36-a-share redemption price recently announced. By midday, NL preferred was one of the New York Stock Exchange's most active stocks, with more than seven million shares changing hands. Mr. Simmons, who is NL's chairman, said his Valhi Inc. bought most of the stock, apparently at prices between $10.50 and $13.    Glenn Schaeffer, Circus Circus Enterprises Inc.'s senior vice president and chief financial officer, said many of his company's employees had expressed interest in buying the company's stock, not to shore up the price as much &quot;as they think it's just a good bargain.&quot; Meanwhile, Circus Circus, a Las Vegas, Nev., casino-hotel operator, said the company itself plans to buy up to 10% of its 37.9 million shares.    About 20 employees stopped Stuart A. Rose, chairman and chief executive officer of Audio/Video Affiliates Inc. yesterday morning as he walked on the sales floor at the Dayton, Ohio-based consumer electronics retailer's headquarters. &quot;Everyone is nervous. They all want to know what's going on,&quot; he said.    The company later announced plans to buy as many as 2.5 million shares, or about 16% of its 15 million shares. &quot;Whether it helps morale or not, it (the buy-back) certainly makes a statement to them -- that we're willing to put our money where our mouth is.&quot;    Some companies with buy-backs already in the works at recently high prices canceled them. Phoenix American Inc., San Rafael, Calif., scrubbed a $5 a share buy-back of 600,000 shares, or 9% of its outstanding shares. The company's shares closed at $4.75 in national over-the-counter trading the day the buy-back was announced. The shares closed yesterday at $4.125.    Several companies announcing buybacks said they planned to use the stock for a variety of employee benefit plans, including profit sharing, stock options and employee stock ownership plans. Oakwood Homes Corp. of Greensboro, N.C., said it might buy as many as 400,000 shares, or about 7% of its common outstanding, for its stock bonus and option plans and for other corporate purposes. Southwest Airlines and Prime Computer both said their repurchased stock will go into employee stock incentive plans.    David Binns, executive director of the ESOP Association of America, a trade group in Washington, D.C., conceded employee stock ownership programs that bought stock at recent highs are in a &quot;tough situation&quot; as the value of those stocks plunged. &quot;Those employees could do nothing yesterday,&quot; he said. &quot;But what could anyone do yesterday?&quot;    On the other hand, Mr. Binns said, employee ownership could have the appeal of broadening ownership and reducing the volatility of stock prices. Michael Baker Corp., a Beaver, Pa., engineering consulting company proved that Monday. One of the few publicly traded companies in the country with majority ownership by the company ESOP, its shares fell only a quarter of a point in Monday's crash, closing at $8.25 a share in American Stock Exchange Stock Exchange composite trading. Baker is 70% owned by the ESOP. &quot;I'm sure that's a factor,&quot; said Donald Baker, treasurer. &quot;Our stock has not reacted to the market&quot; because employees, not institutional traders, hold the shares, he said.    If companies' buy-backs helped prop up some stock prices, so, possibly, might have dividend rises. A number of companies boosted dividends yesterday, including Honeywell, Citizens andamp; Southern Corp., Dominion Bankshares Corp., First Tennessee National Corp., Susquehanna Bancshares Inc. and the Federal National Mortgage Association.    Here is a list of the companies that announced plans for buy-backs or took other actions that might lead to repurchasing their shares:    Aaron Spelling Productions Inc., Alco Standard Corp., Allegis Corp., Ametek Inc., Analog Devices Inc., American Medical International Inc., Audio/Video Affiliates Inc., Avatar Holdings Inc., Bally Manufacturing Corp., Banc One Corp., BellSouth Corp., Best Products Co., Handamp;R Block Inc., Bowne andamp; Co., Burlington Northern Inc., Carnival Cruise, Centel Corp., Centuri Inc.;    Chrysler Corp., Circus Circus Enterprises Inc., Citicorp,Conseco Inc., Eaton Vance Corp., FGIC Corp., Ford Motor Co.,GAF Corp., General Host Corp., General Motors Corp., J.Higby's Inc., Hilton Hotels Corp., Intelogic Trace Inc.,Intergraph Corp., Josephson International Inc., LittonIndustries Inc., MCA Inc., Manor Care Inc., Masco IndustriesInc., McGraw Hill Inc.;   Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., National Distillers andamp; Chemical Corp., Oakwood Homes Corp., Oneida Ltd., Pacific Telesis Group, Perkin-Elmer Corp., Prime Computer Inc., Quaker Oats Co., RJR Nabisco Inc., Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., Southwest Airlines, Sterling Software Inc., Travelers Corp., U.S. HealthCare Inc., U S West Inc., USX Corp., Union Camp Corp., United Brands Co., United Technologies Corp.
