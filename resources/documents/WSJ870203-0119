Breck</HL><DD> 02/03/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   Kelly seemed tired after his flight from Manila. The trip had been only modestly productive.    &quot;Do you think they'll default?&quot; I asked.    &quot;They're slow to move,&quot; he complained. &quot;The country's busted, but most of the government people went to UCLA and Princeton and they don't want to lose their fraternity friends. They've all got houses and co-ops here, anyway. Same problem in Latin America. It's hard for American-educated officials to crank up their nerve.&quot;    &quot;The governments all agreed to reschedule their Philippine debt.&quot;    &quot;Which brings in no new money. The place is a political mess. They have two wars going on. The banks still want their money back and the Filipinos owe $27 billion. What businessman with any sense would invest a dollar in Manila with all that overhanging? They need money badly. You do the math.&quot;    &quot;Kelly, how do you intend to get rich out of this debt crisis?&quot;    &quot;We're going to see a fascinating confrontation. There could be millions for those who guess right.&quot;    &quot;But how? The situation seems stable. A little restructuring here, a few deferrals there, some IMF soup, some World Bank salad, some speeches at the U.N., and in 10 or 15 years it'll be a much smaller problem. As you point out, even countries in terrible shape don't seem willing to default. You remind me of friends who warned me the world was going to collapse in August 1982, when Mexico first couldn't pay. They shorted the market and then had to go back to work.&quot;    &quot;It's different now. More people are hurting, including some on the creditor side. This time, life will imitate art. To understand the debt crisis you should read &quot;The Lottery,&quot; by Shirley Jackson, or better yet Dashiell Hammett.&quot;    &quot;Kelly, I'm just a speculator . . .&quot;    &quot;Listen. I dropped in on an international debt conference at the Waldorf in early December. The usual suspects: bankers, economists, professors, a few investment bankers on the make, but this time there were industrialists and some politicians as well. Politicians? That woke me up. There were Kemp, Domenici, and Bill Bradley; Colby Chandler, who runs Kodak; and a tough, smart lady from the Philippines named Solita Monsod. So I listened. Suddenly I knew I'd seen the scene before. It was straight out of &quot;The Maltese Falcon.'&quot;    Kelly was animated now and wouldn't let me interrupt. &quot;Remember the scene near the end where the villains are all gathered in one room, finally working together to get their hands on the black bird? They're so close to success. But there's one messy detail. There are two corpses to account for and the San Francisco police will need a fall guy . . . a perpetrator. Bogart -- he's Sam Spade -- points to the young kid, Wilmer, the gunman, and snarls, 'Let's give them the gunsel.'&quot;    &quot;Of course! Sidney Greenstreet plays the Fat Man, and Peter Lorre, he's Joel Cairo . . .&quot;    &quot;Exactly. 'Ridiculous,' giggles the Fat Man. 'I feel towards Wilmer just exactly as if he were my own son . . . but go ahead and outline the rest of it.' Then Peter Lorre whispers in the Fat Man's ear, and Bogart looks at Wilmer, who can't believe this is going to happen to him, and says 'Two to one they're selling you out, son.' And that is just what they do. And that's just what the current villains are going to do to the U.S. commercial banks. They're about to give them to the San Francisco police. Goodbye, Wilmer! The U.S. banks are going to take the fall.&quot;    &quot;Kelly, this is irresponsible. Our banks are the core of our system, an indispensable part of our economic fabric. Why, many people at those banks are very close to me personally . . .&quot;    &quot;They're expendable. There's no money to pay them back. Everyone knows that. They're getting in the way of progress. The chief executive of Kodak, Colby Chandler, was telling the room that Kodak, Westinghouse and Caterpillar can't sell stuff to countries that have no money. He'd like to get on with life. Think if these countries could spend the money they owe to the banks on something useful. They'd buy from Kodak, Cat Tractor, IBM, Boeing, and it would be the 1970s all over again. Bonanza!&quot;    &quot;But they do owe the money.&quot;    &quot;That's a political matter calling for the most delicate judgment, as Sidney Greenstreet says. Speaking of politicians, Bill Bradley won best casting for a 1987 Sam Spade.&quot;    &quot;What's his angle?&quot;    &quot;Not sure. I sense he has a sort of moral commitment. The other politicians left after the photo opportunities, but Bradley stuck it out for two full days. He is technically sound, much better than the banks think. He's persistent and not scared by big-deal Eastern bankers. Some overweight guy from Citibank was droning on about how everything was fine, we should just keep on rescheduling, and after he finished Bradley interrupted. He started slowly. 'Let me understand your position. These countries owe you a lot of money and can't pay you back. You won't lend them any new money until they're growing and economically healthy. They can't grow without new money. They can't repay the existing loans until they grow. This is a big problem for a lot of people. How are you contributing to a solution?' That was the essence of it, anyway. When he finished the bankers were very quiet.&quot;    &quot;Did the Europeans support the U.S. banks?&quot;    &quot;All they said was 'Vee heff no problem.' They wrote their loans off years ago.&quot;    &quot;Wasn't there a girl in 'The Maltese Falcon'? The killer?&quot;    &quot;Indeed. That Solita Monsod from the Philippines came on after Bradley. She was very good. 'We'll try to pay, but we need your help. If we can't pay, we won't.' Strong lady. Her interests are clear.&quot;    &quot;But surely our government will rally around our commercial banks. We can't let them get hurt.&quot;    &quot;Around the banks, maybe, but not around the managements and the shareholders. They made a big mistake and they should go over for it. Colby Chandler didn't make those loans, nor did any American workers. Look, we have a colossal trade deficit.    &quot;We can't sell goods to countries with no money and no credit. The Germans and the Japanese are flush, but they don't seem eager to buy our products. What's more important: jobs, farmers, exports or the banks? My quick fix for the trade deficit is to wipe out the Third World loans. A lot of congressmen may think that way in six months. Bradley might hold hearings. In 1988 we'll have elections. You tell me where the votes are.&quot;    &quot;That may be true domestically. But Kelly, the international implications . . .&quot;    &quot;The Swiss, French and Germans don't care. The IMF and the World Bank don't vote or draw unemployment. The Japanese will be discreet and calculate their miraculous new export opportunities. Everyone who exports anything will be delighted. The debtors will be ecstatic. The environmentalists can have their game parks. Are our banks holy relics? It's such a good deal for so many people. Sam Spade said it best. Nobody will play the sap for the U.S. banks.&quot;    &quot;Kelly, you can't say things like this. But, just for the sake of argument, precisely how do you think all this might come about?&quot;    &quot;That's politics and timing. Hard to predict. Apply heat and eventually the water will boil. Perhaps the villains will send signals abroad to the debtors encouraging them to take the initiative. Perhaps Congress will enact some international bankruptcy legislation. All parties must evaluate their interests. We are just at the beginning. Peter Lorre is leaning over to whisper in the Fat Man's ear.&quot;    &quot;Aren't you scared of an international financial crisis?&quot;    &quot;No. We should calculate the maximum hit the U.S. banks will have to take and the minimum amount the Treasury, which means the citizens, will have to put up in cash or standby guarantees. By the way, Citicorp paid $337 million in cash dividends in 1986, making it more than $1.3 billion in the last five years. Do they act as if there's a crisis? Industry will support this. So will labor. Alan Greenspan will write a learned article comparing it all with reparations after World War I. Personally, I'll take my chances on a smashup. Rhett Butler said you could make more money during the collapse of an empire than during its growth. But what makes this so fascinating is that it won't lead to a panic. This is the way to a huge boom.&quot;    &quot;Good for business? Could it be good for me?&quot;    &quot;Absolutely. It's the obvious deal. We'll all profit from it. Even the poor devils in the Third World might have a chance for half a loaf. I have such a good feeling about what's coming that I'll even buy the drinks. Here's to Wilmer.&quot;    ---   Mr. Breck wrote of Quickfix Kelly in &quot;African Relief, Spelled D-E-F-A-U-L-T&quot; for the Journal last November. </TEXT></DOC>
