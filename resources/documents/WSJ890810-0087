Yields on certificates of deposit have dropped one percentage point or more since late April.    But interest rates on credit cards and unsecured personal loans have actually risen a bit, on average. And, at a time when many new car dealers are wringing their hands about groaning inventories of unsold 1989 models, rates on most auto loans have hardly budged.    &quot;By holding borrowing rates high while slashing rates on CDs, banks are widening their spread at the expense of the consumer,&quot; says Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, a newsletter based in North Palm Beach, Fla., that tracks deposit and loan rates. The spread, or the difference between what banks pay for funds and what they charge for loans, translates into profit margins.    Banks generally adjust interest rates on deposits and loans as yields rise and fall on money market securities such as Treasury bills. But when rates fall, it's usually depositors -- not borrowers -- who see the declines first.    This time, Mr. Heady says, the disparity between deposit and loan rates is the widest it has been at the beginning of a downward trend in interest rates since bank interest rates were deregulated six and a half years ago.    At Citibank in New York, for instance, the annual yield on a one-year CD has plummeted more than two percentage points, to 7.46% from 9.64% in late April. Meanwhile, the interest rate on unsecured personal loans is unchanged at 17.9%, and the rate on new-car loans is up to 14.75% from 13.9% in late April.    In the Washington, D.C., area, according to Bank Rate Monitor, Perpetual Savings Bank is charging 17% annually on personal loans, up from 16.5%, and 11.75% on new-car loans, up from 11.25%. The yield on one-year CDs has fallen to 8.71% from 9.63%.    Most interest rates have fallen about a percentage point in the past three months. The federal funds rate, the rate on overnight loans among banks, is currently about 9%, down from just under 10%. Six-month Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction yielded 8.12%; those sold April 24 had a 9.25% yield.    Some bank loan rates have come down, too. According to Bank Rate Monitor's index, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage currently is 9.77%, down from about 11% in late April. The introductory rate on a one-year adjustable rate mortgage with a 30-year term has fallen to an average 8.60% from 9.62%.    Rates on other adjustable-rate loans, such as many home-equity loans, also have fallen. Most of those are linked to the prime lending rate, a benchmark that now stands at 10.5%, compared with 11.5% in the spring.    Some personal loans and auto loans also carry adjustable rates. Generally, however, rates on personal and auto loans, as well as credit-card rates, aren't linked directly to what happens in the money markets. Instead, banks set them on the basis of a variety of factors, including competition.    &quot;It's a balancing act,&quot; says Bernard Schumacher, senior vice president and treasurer of Perpetual Savings Bank. &quot;We have to be careful not to take ourselves out of the market.&quot;    Mr. Schumacher notes that it's harder to attract depositors as interest rates fall, but loan demand picks up. As a result, banks have to rely more on money they borrow to fund loan demand.    Certainly, consumers haven't stopped borrowing. The Federal Reserve's latest report on consumer debt, released Tuesday, showed that consumer installment credit outstanding rose almost $3 billion in June, equal to a 5.1% annual rate of growth.    Bankers maintain that the widening gap between loan and deposit rates is justified. When interest rates start to fall, &quot;the lender has to ask himself if that's a permanent phenomenon,&quot; says Robert Duggar, chief economist for the American Bankers Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group. &quot;It may be better to leave a higher rate in place than to have to readjust it upward later.&quot;    Moreover, Mr. Duggar says, lending rates reflect administrative costs and loan losses as well as a bank's cost of funds. &quot;Increases in delinquencies can mean that even though the cost of funds goes down, profitability can go down, too,&quot; he notes.    Bank Rate Monitor's Mr. Heady predicts that the massive federal bailout of troubled thrift institutions will mean higher loan rates for consumers. Premiums paid by banks and thrifts into federal deposit insurance funds will rise substantially under the legislation signed into law yesterday, raising the cost of doing business for financial institutions.    &quot;Loan rates are less visible than savings account yields,&quot; Mr. Heady says. &quot;Banks splash their latest CD rates across their windows in three-foot high letters.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
