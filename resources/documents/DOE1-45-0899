Surface wipe samplesand air samples were analyzed in four classrooms where complaints hadoriginated and in three reference rooms where no symptoms had been reported.No levels of PCB air concentrations were found exceeding 0.1 microgram/cubicmeter (microg/m{sup 3}) in any reference room. In three of four indexrooms, PCB concentrations were recorded at 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 microg/m{sup3}, which were below the NIOSH recommended exposure level (1microg/m3time weighted average). Surface-wipe samples from student and teacherdesk tops averaged 1.3 micrograms per square meter (microg/m{sup 2}),with a maximum of 2.4microg/m{sup 2}. On low contact surfaces, PCB concentrationsranged from 1.6 to 9.2microg/m{sup 2}.</TEXT></DOC>
