Inc., whose cigarette unithas championed smokers' rights, on Wednesday launched acorporate-image advertising campaign pegged to the 200thanniversary of the Bill of Rights.   The campaign includes ads that put the Philip Morris name backon television for the first time since it quit advertising itsnamesake cigarette brand on TV in the 1950s.   Broadcast advertising of cigarettes has been banned since 1971.   The new commercials make no mention of cigarettes or smoking,and Philip Morris executives said they never will. The ads simplylist at the close the company's name and those of its threeoperating subsidiaries, which include the Philip Morris U.S.A.cigarette concern, its Kraft General Foods packaged goods companyand its Miller Brewing Co.   But anti-smoking campaigners criticized the new ads anyway.   ``It's just another attempt by the tobacco companies toassociate themselves with wholesome innocent images like youth,athletics and the arts,'' said Steve Dickinson, a spokesman for theAmerican Cancer Society.   The ads, which were launched in print and on televisionWednesday morning, invite people to call a toll-free telephonenumber if they want a free copy of the Bill of Rights _ the first10 amendments to the Constitution.   Guy L. Smith IV, vice president for corporate affairs at PhilipMorris, said there were 5,000 calls in the first hour after thecommercial appeared on the morning news shows Wednesday.   Philip Morris is expected to spend $30 million a year on thetwo-year campaign, including costs of placing the ads on televisionand in newspapers and magazines as well as mailing the requesteddocuments to callers.   Smith said Philip Morris decided to launch its first corporatecampaign partly to show people that the company has grownconsiderably in the past few years, particularly with itsacquisitions of General Foods and Kraft.   It now owns the nation's largest food company, the largesttobacco company and the second largest beer company.   Its products include Marlboro cigarettes, Miller beer, Jell-Odesserts, Kraft cheese and salad dressings and Maxwell Housecoffee. The Philip Morris cigarette brand has been renamed and iscalled Commander.   The ads are tied in with the National Archives' observance ofthe 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights.   Jill Brett, an archives spokeswoman, said Philip Morris ishandling distribution of requested copies of the Bill of Rights andother materials the archives has prepared and may underwrite anational tour connected to the anniversary.   She said the archives wanted to reach as many people as it couldwith an educational campaign about the Bill of Rights and feltPhilip Morris had a track record for supporting culturalinstitutions and the arts.   ``We look at it as an opportunity to reach millions of Amricanswe could not reach otherwise without corporate support,'' she said.   Marketing consultant Al Ries of Trout andamp; Ries in Greenwich,Conn., said Philip Morris must have been mindful of increasingthreats of more regulation of the tobacco industry when it decidedto tout the Bill of Rights in ads.   ``They are hoping that people will look at their ads and say tothemselves maybe smokers should have rights too,'' Ries said.   Michael Pertschuk, the former head of the Federal TradeCommission who was involved as a Senate staffer in the efforts toban broadcast advertising of tobacco products in 1971, said thePhilip Morris ads are ``an attempt to legitimize itself as aninstitution'' by associating the company ``with those things thatare American and holy.''   ``That would be fine for a company that sold a product that iswholesome and decent, but it's not fine for a company that stillspends billions of dollars to promote and aggressively market aproduct that kills hundreds of thousands of people,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
