Any reading above 20 picocuries per liter is consideredsufficient to trigger detailed 30-day and one-year testing of allhabitable structures at a base and immediate repair work.   Any reading of 4 to 20 picocuries per liter triggers a one-yeardetailed sampling of all habitable structures, followed by repairwork as required.   The Air Force said Thursday that sampling at five bases hadproduced readings above 20 picocuries per liter, while sampling at49 bases had produced readings of 4 to 20 picocuries.   Of the bases with readings above 20 picocuries, three of thebases are in the United States or a U.S. territory and two are inforeign countries. Of those with readings of 4 to 20 picocuries, 33bases are in the United States and 16 in foreign countries. The AirForce said it would not identify any of the bases overseas untilthe host country's government is notified, the Air Force said.</TEXT><HEAD>Bases with Readings Above 20 picocuries</HEAD><TEXT>   _Andersen Air Force Base, Guam.   _Peterson Air Force Base, Colo.   _U.S. Air Force Academy, Colo.</TEXT><HEAD>Bases with Readings of 4 to 20 picocuries</HEAD><TEXT/><HEAD>Strategic Air Command</HEAD><TEXT>   _Carswell Air Force Base, Texas.   _Ellsworth Air Force Base, S.D.   _Fairchild Air Force Base, Wash.   _F.E.
