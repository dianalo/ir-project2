(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge ruled Jim Bakker competentto stand trial on fraud charges Wednesday after a governmentpsychiatrist testified the PTL founder was not going crazy when hebroke down last week.   Bakker's trial resumed nearly a week after he was found hidingunder a couch and hallucinating in his lawyer's office lastThursday. He was sent to a federal prison in Butner for psychiatricevaluation.   ``For the first time in three years, the whole situation camehome to him and he began to cry,'' Sally Johnson, chief ofpsychiatric services at the prison, told U.S. District Judge RobertPotter.   ``He is not going crazy,'' Ms. Johnson testified with jurorsabsent. ``He has no hidden mental illness. The stress that he'sfeeling is normal. I can't rule it out that it won't happen again,but I can't rule it in either.''   Potter ordered Bakker released from federal marshals' custody andasked Bakker, who was brought to court in leg irons and handcuffs,to stand and answer questions.   ``Do you understand what you are on trial here for?'' the judgeasked Bakker, who is accused of fleecing followers of his PTLministry.   ``Yes sir,'' Bakker responded quietly.   Asked if he was able to assist his lawyers, Bakker said, ``I'mvery tired, but I believe I can.''   Bakker, 49, showed little emotion, sometimes hanging his head andstaring at the floor. He wore a suit his wife, Tammy Faye, hadbrought him.   Mrs. Bakker, who attended the hearing with other family members,has protested her husband's treatment at the federal prison hospital.   ``This should not be allowed in the United States of America,''was her only comment as she left the courthouse.   Potter, after meeting with attorneys in chambers, also denieddefense lawyers' motions for a mistrial, for a continuance and fordismissal of the indictment against Bakker.   Bakker, who resigned from the PTL ministry in 1987 during asex-and-money scandal, went on trial Aug. 28 on conspiracy and fraudcharges. Prosecutors said he used nearly $4 million in ministryfunds to live in high style.   If convicted on all 24 counts against him, he could could receive120 years in prison and more than $5 million in fines.   After Wednesday's lunch break, former PTL Vice President SteveNelson, who collapsed under defense cross-examination lastWednesday, resumed testifying for the prosecution.   Questioned by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller, Nelson saidhe went to Bakker and Richard Dortch, another ex-PTL vice president,to express his concern over the number of ``lifetime partnerships''sold at Heritage USA, the Christian retreat and amusement parkcreated by Bakker.   Prosecutors contend that Bakker oversold partnerships despite hisstatements on TV and in promotional literature that there was alimit. A $1,000 donation gave a partner free lodging in the 500-roomhotel three nights a year.   ``I told them we had problems getting people in there,'' Nelsonsaid. ``I told them we could not sell more. ...'' He said Bakker andDortch told him to keep selling the partnerships.   Dortch, indicted with Bakker, pleaded guilty to four counts offraud and conspiracy and was sentenced to eight years in prison anda $200,000 fine.   Defense attorney Harold Bender, who was questioning Nelson lastweek when the witness fainted, chose not to cross-examine himWednesday. In the mistrial motion, Bender said the collapse hadprejudiced the jury against Bakker.   Bakker appeared more alert during Nelson's testimony. He smiled,chatted with attorneys and reviewed documents. Mrs. Bakker did notattend the afternoon session.   Court was recessed for the day around 5:30 p.m. As Bakker leftthe courthouse, he waved at photographers and said, ``I'm glad to beout of where I was.'' He also said he had the flu, then got intoBender's BMW sedan and left.   During the morning session, Ms. Johnson said her preliminarydiagnosis of Bakker was that he had suffered a panic attack afterNelson's collapse. Nelson had testified that he had told Bakkersomeone could go to prison because of the ministry's financialpractices.   Bakker didn't come to court the next day, and lawyers told Potterhe was hallucinating and hiding his head under a couch at theiroffice.   Asked if she thought Bakker had faked his emotional collapse, thedoctor said no.   ``It was a powerful emotional reaction and release,'' Ms. Johnsonsaid. ``The weight of all these things began to coalesce. ...   Ms. Johnson also said Bakker suffered narcissism, or excessiveself-absorption, and depression.   The psychiatrist said the panic attack was not caused by Bakker'staking an anti-depressant prescribed by his private psychiatrist,but could not rule out that it had had an impact on his mentalstate. She also testified that Bakker had taken aspirin and istaking an antibiotic for a cold.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller asked Ms. Johnson if shefelt Bakker was hallucinating when he left court last week.   ``I did not label it as hallucinatory phenomena,'' she replied.   She said Bakker told her he hadn't felt well and that radio andtelevision news crews gathered at the courthouse took on the form offrightening animals. She said he told her they appeared as ``largeants with antennae.''   Ms. Johnson said Bakker insisted he hadn't lost touch withreality.   ``He did not lose sight that they were actually the press,'' shesaid. ``It was an experience in which he was very frightened andthere was a large number of people in the crowd.''</TEXT></DOC>
