<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-28-0170 </DOCNO><TEXT>The method of far wing collision pair spectroscopy, providing dynamicalinformation under conditions of a half collision with control of thepotential curve, the collision energy and the impact parameter rangeis outlined and applied to fine structure changing and depolarizationmechanisms of Na3P atoms interacting with rare gas targets at thermalenergies. For this purpose experimental excitation spectra of the Na3P/subJ/ find structure population ratio and J=3/2 alignment obtained undersingle collision conditions are analyzed on the basis of a fully quantummechanical,nonadiabatic theory of optical line shapes and semiclassical model calculations.Discussed in detail are the effects on the alignment formation of molecularcoherences, spin decoupling from the molecular axis, realistic trajectoriesand the type of transformation of molecular to atomic states during thehalf collision following excitation.</TEXT></DOC>
