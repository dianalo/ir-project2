The brucellosis regulations contained in 9 CFR Part 78 (referred to belowas the regulations) provide a system for classifying States or portionsof States according to the rate of brucella infection present, and thegeneral effectiveness of a brucellosis control and eradication program.The classifications are Class Free, Class A, Class B, and Class C. Statesor areas that do not meet the minimum standards for Class C status arerequired to be placed under federal quarantine. The brucellosis Class Free classification is based on a finding of no knownbrucellosis in cattle for the 12 months preceding classification as ClassFree. The Class C classification is for States or areas with the highestrate of brucellosis. Class B and Class A fall between these two extremes.Restrictions on moving cattle interstate become less stringent as a Stateapproaches or achieves Class Free status. The standards for the different classifications of States or areas entailmaintaining (1) a cattle herd infection rate not to exceed a stated levelduring 12 consecutive months; (2) a rate of infection in the cattle population(based on the percentage of brucellosis reactors found in the Market CattleIdentification (MCI) program_a program of testing at stockyards, farms,ranches, and slaughtering establishments) not to exceed a stated level;(3) a surveillance system that includes testing of dairy herds, participationof all slaughtering establishments in the MCI program, identification andmonitoring of herds at high risk of infection_including herds adjacentto infected herds and herds from which infected animals have been soldor received, and having an individual herd plan in effect within a statednumber of days after the herd owner is notified of the finding of brucellosisin a herd he or she owns; and (4) minimum procedural standards for administeringthe program. Before the publication of this interim rule, Florida was divided into aClass B area and a Class C area. The Class C area included the followingcounties; Brevard, Broward, Charlotte, Collier, Dade, De Soto, Glades,Hardee, Hendry, Highlands, Hillsborough, Indian River, Lee, Manatee, Martin,Monroe, Okeechobee, Osceola, Palm Beach, Polk, Saint Lucie, and Sarasota.The Class B area included the remainder of the State. To attain and maintain Class B status, the regulations require that a Stateor area must have: (1) An adjusted MCI reactor prevalence rate not to exceedthree reactors per 1,000 cattle tested (0.3 percent) for 12 consecutivemonths; (2) an accumulated 12-month herd infection rate for brucellosisin cattle not to exceed 15 herds per 1,000 (1.5 percent); (3) a surveillancesystem that includes testing of dairy herds, participation of all slaughteringestablishments in the MCI program, identification and monitoring of herdsat high risk of infection, including herds adjacent to infected herds andherds from which infected animals have been sold or received, and havingan individual herd plan in effect within a stated number of days afternotification of brucellosis in a herd; and (4) minimum procedural standardsfor administering the program. After reviewing its brucellosis programrecords, we have concluded that the entire State of Florida meets the standardsfor Class B status. Therefore, we are removing the counties in Florida from the list of ClassC States in andSection; 78.41(d) and are adding it to the list of Class BStates in andSection; 78.41(c) so that this list includes the entire Stateof Florida. This action changes the split status of Florida from ClassC/Class B to all Class B, and relieves certain restrictions on moving cattleinterstate from Florida. <ITAG tagnum="84">Immediate Action </ITAG>James W. Glosser, Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, has determined that there is good cause for publishing this rulewithout prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is warrantedto remove unnecessary restrictions on the interstate movement of cattlefrom Florida. Since prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this interimrule are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under theseemergency conditions, there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make iteffective upon signature. We will consider comments that are received within60 days of publication of this interim rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. After the comment period closes, we will publishanother document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, including discussion of any comments we receiveand any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291. Cattle moved interstate are moved for slaughter, for use as breeding stock,or for feeding. Changing the status of Florida from Class C/Class B toall Class B reduces certain testing requirements and branding and spayingcosts involved in the interstate movement of cattle from Class C areas.The principal group affected by this change are the owners of herds inthe former Class C areas of Florida that are not certified brucellosis-freeand are not known to be affected with brucellosis. Buyers and exportersof cattle, stockyards, feedlots, and intermediate handling facilities areaffected to a negligible degree. In accordance with 9 CFR 78.9, all cattle in Class C noncertified-freeherds can move interstate only to slaughter, or to a quarantined feedlotif they are ``S'' branded, unless they are steers, spayed heifers, or bullsunder 18 months of age. It is estimated that there are 409,000 cows insuch herds in the Class C area of Florida. We anticipate that these cowswill produce approximately 174,000 heifers during the next year. We estimatethat at least 50,000 of these will be sold interstate. The change to ClassB status makes it possible to sell them for purposes other than slaughteror consignment to a quarantined feedlot, without spaying them, in accordancewith 9 CFR 78.9(c)(3). The cost of spaying 50,000 heifers is estimated at $550,000 or $11 perhead. Not all the heifers would be spayed if the Class C status remainedunchanged; many would be sold for slaughter or ``S'' branded and movedto quarantined feedlots. However, $550,000 can be considered one upperlimit for benefits accrued by the change from Class C to Class B status.Another cost of moving cattle from Class C areas is the cost associatedwith ``S'' branding, required if unspayed animals are moved to quarantinedfeedlots, or indirectly to slaughter through intermediate handling facilities,nonquarantined feedlots, or stockyards. Based on current prices and demandfor light heifers, the net proceeds per animal will be increased by approximately$20 if the heifers from nonquarantined herds are not required to be ``S''branded or sold for slaughter, resulting in a maximum $1,000,000 savingsto the industry if 50,000 heifers were so moved. The upper limit to the economic impact of this rule would be $1,550,000of financial benefit accrued primarily by owners of herds that are notcertified brucellosis free and that are located in former Class C areas.This figure assumes that all cattle moved from these herds are not spayed,and are moved to destinations that require ``S'' branding. Actual savingswill be less, since some cattle will be spayed or not ``S'' branded. According to National Agricultural Statistics Service estimates, thereare 7,144 cattle herds in the Class C area of Florida. Of these herds,2,269 are certified free. Of the 4,875 noncertified-free herds, 4,606 arenot quarantined. These 4,606 herds would be directly and positively affectedby the change. The owners of these 4,606 herds could each receive additionalprofits of up to $20 per calf sold, or an average of $217 per herd owner,assuming equal herd sizes. About 4,556 (99 percent) of the 4,606 herdsare small businesses (annual revenues of less than $500,000). Because the50 herds that are large businesses have larger herd sizes, and becausenot all herd owners will sell their cattle in ways that do not requirespaying or ``S'' branding, the actual profit to each small hard owner willbe less. We have therefore determined that changing Florida's brucellosis statuswill not significantly affect current market patterns, and will not havea significant economic impact on small entities. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirementsunder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372 </ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmentalconsultation with State and local officials.
