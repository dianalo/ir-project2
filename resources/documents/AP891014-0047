Pinochet made the surprise statement Friday during an appearancein Coihaique, 1,350 miles south of Santiago, the capital.   Without elaborating, Pinochet said the secret police, known bytheir Spanish-language acronym CNI, would be dissolved before themilitary junta that has ruled Chile since a 1973 coup steps aside.   Human rights organizations have accused the secret police ofusing torture and committing other abuses against members of thecountry's opposition.   Pinochet also said Friday that Chile's armed forces would notallow members of the military to be tried for alleged human rightsabuses by the civilian government.   Centrist politician Patricio Aylwin, the opposition's candidatefor president, is favored to defeat government candidate HernanBuchi _ Pinochet's former finance minister _ in Dec. 14 balloting.The new president will be installed March 11.   Opposition members have called for the prosecution of militaryofficers accused of human rights abuses.   But Pinochet said the military would not permit its members tobe ``scorned and humiliated for actions destined to save Chile.''   More than 700 people disappeared and thousands were arrested,tortured or sent into exile in a wave of anti-leftist repressionafter Pinochet and other military officers ousted elected civilianPresident Salvador Allende. In recent years, violent repression hasdeclined significantly but some acts against dissidents continue,human rights groups contend.   In a referendum on Oct. 5, 1988, Chileans rejected the73-year-old army commander's bid to extend his rule until 1997.   Under terms of a 1980 constitution, the vote cleared the way foropen presidential elections.   Pinochet has said he will remain army commander after he leavesthe presidency. Under the constitution crafted by hisadministration, Pinochet and other military chiefs are entitled totheir commands until 1998.</TEXT></DOC>
