IDD Information Services said that 1,705 transactions werecompleted in the first two quarters, up from 1,622 in the firsthalf of 1987.   More impressive, perhaps, was that the deals this year carried apricetag of $131 billion, up from $89.5 billion in the year-agoperiod, the firm said.   Foreign investors snapped up U.S. companies at a rapid pace,spending $25 billion on acquisitions in the first half of thisyear, up 67 percent from $15 billion in 1987.   IDD attributed the interest _ led by Canada, Japan and GreatBritain _ to a weaker dollar.   Despite predictions of a decrease in activity following theOctober market crash, leveraged buyouts moved along at a briskclip. In the first half of the year, IDD said there were 77leveraged buyouts with a total value of $30 billion, compared with58 buyouts valued at $20 billion a year ago.   In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow against a targetcompany's assets and repay borrowed funds from the company's cashflow.   The use of tender offers as a way to acquire companies alsoincreased dramatically. IDD said such transactions were valued at$75.9 billion, compared with $35.3 billion in tender offers a yearago.   In terms of number of transactions completed, Shearson LehmanHutton Inc. led the pack of major investment houses by acting asfinancial advisor in 92 deals; followed by Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. with77 and First Boston Corp. with 70.   Based on dollar value, however, Goldman Sachs was No. 1,representing $41.72 billion in completed transactions, followed byShearson Lehman, $40.4 billion, and First Boston, $34.1 billion.
