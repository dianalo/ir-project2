Also today, the army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, wasquoted as saying troops can never quell the rebellion because it isa political struggle.   The reports are likely to increase the debate among Israelis overthe army's role in combating the 13-month uprising in the West Bankand Gaza Strip.   Five more Palestinians were wounded in the uprising today, andthree Palestinians were indicted in the firebombing of an Israelipassenger bus.   The mass-circulation daily Maariv reported that Maj. Gen.Menachem Einan was leaving his job as the army's logistics chiefover concern about the impact of the uprising on Israeli soldiers.   ``I am very worried about the level of morality of Israelsoldiers in the territories,'' Einan was quoted as saying. ``We aremaking them face provocations that inspire maliciousness all tooquickly.''   An army spokesman said on condition of anonymity that Einan wouldstep down Friday to take a civilian job. However, the spokesman, whodemanded anonymity, said the resignation had nothing to do with thereported criticism.   The military command refused to allow The Associated Press tointerview Einan and made no immediate statement on the report.   In the interview with Maariv, Einan traced his worries to thegovernment's handling of its 1982 Lebanon invasion, which turnedinto a three-year war instead of the planned limited campaign. Hesaid the result showed him the military should sometimes questionwhat political leaders are saying.   ``My big lesson is that perhaps there are times when the fightingmilitary echelons cannot accept to the last letter the instructionsgiven by political echelons,'' he said.   In another report, the Jerusalem Post said Shomron told aclosed-door session of Parliament's Defense and Foreign AffairsCommittee on Tuesday that the army was limited in its ability tobreak up the ``intefadeh,'' the Arabic word used for the uprising.   ``There is no such thing as eradicating the intefadeh, because inessence it expressed the struggle of nationalism,'' the paper quotedhim as saying.   Israeli newspapers said today the army indicted threePalestinians on murder charges for throwing three firebombs at anIsraeli passenger bus Oct. 30 in the West Bank city of Jericho. FiveIsraelis _ a soldier, a mother, and her three small children _ diedin the attack.   A total of 15 Israelis have been killed as a result of theuprising in the territories Israel took from Arab neighbors in the1967 Middle East War. At least 349 Palestinians have been killed,most by army gunfire.   Israeli troops today shot and wounded five young Palestinians inclashes in the Gaza Strip refugee camps of Nusseirat and Khan Yunisand the West Bank village of Ein Abush, Arab doctors said. Among thewounded was a 12-year-old shot in the left thigh. The army said itwas checking the reports.</TEXT></DOC>
