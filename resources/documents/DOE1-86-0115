NGA was prepared by covalently coupling D-galactoseto normal human albumin. NGA was labeled with technetium-99m accordingto the electrolytic method by Benjamin, which produced Tc-99m-NGA withlabeling yield in excess of 95%. Tc-99m-NGA was proved to be stable forat least 4 hours as determined by high performance liquid chromatography.Biodistribution studies of Tc-99m-NGA in normal rats demonstrated thatliver is a sole target organ of Tc-99m-NGA. The lack of hepatic uptakeof Tc-99m-NGA in healthy chicken corresponded to the lack of the asialoglycoproteinreceptors in avian species. Tc-99m-NGA study in a normal volunteer showedapparently different images from those of Tc-99m-pyridoxyl-5-methyltryptophan(PMT) or Tc-99m phytate, suggesting that Tc-99m-NGA is a novel liverimaging radiopharmaceutical. The estimation of the time activity curvesin the liver corresponded to the hepatic functional reserves which wereevaluated by existing method in 9 clinical cases (2: Normal volunteers,1: Chronic Active Hepatitis, 1: Liver Cirrhosis (Child A), 2: Liver Cirrhosis(Child B), 3: Liver Cirrhosis (Child C)). The NGA is useful as an imagingagent as well as in the estimation of the hepatic functional reserve,as the dynamic curves of the liver correlates to the asialoglycoproteinreceptor concentration.</TEXT></DOC>
