At last tally, the jobless rate was5.2%, near a 15-year low. And it has been at about that levelfor more than a year. Yet, manufacturers have let nearly250,000 workers go in the past year and enough retailers arein trouble to hold a spring convention in bankruptcy court.What goes on?   Sure, the economy has escaped a recession so far, but itsgrowth has slowed enough to cause computers at theforecasting firm of DRI/McGraw-Hill to predict an upturn inthe jobless rate by now. Likewise, Federal Reserve ChairmanAlan Greenspan has been anticipating greater unemploymentwith the sluggish economic growth.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   The low jobless rate partly reflects the economy'scontinuing expansion, of course. But the unexpectedly lowlevel may also reflect long-term forces at work within theeconomy. Unrelated to the business cycle's periodic ups anddowns, these forces include slowing labor-force growth, ashrinking economic role for manufacturers and harderproductivity gains -- along with skill or luck at the Fed.                                                                                                          The impact of demographics on the labor force can be seenin a few statistics. With the youngest baby boomers turning26 this year, fewer young people are looking for their firstadult jobs. In the past 12 months, the labor force -- thoseworking or looking for work -- grew only 1.3%, down from 1.7%a year in the 1980s and 2.4% in the 1970s.   &quot;We don't have to create so many jobs just to standstill,&quot; says Janet Norwood, U.S. commissioner of laborstatistics.   Remember candidate George Bush's pledge to create 30million jobs during his presidency? He doesn't talk about itany more. The latest Economic Report of the President insteadcalls for more immigration to ease an anticipated laborshortage.   The jobless rate could edge up a few tenths of a percentat any time, of course -- or more if a bona fide recessiondevelops. But if the economy continues at its currentplodding pace, as most forecasters expect, the jobless rateis likely to remain low.   Roger Brinner of DRI/McGraw-Hill figures the economy needgrow only 2.5% a year to keep the rate steady. &quot;Back in the'60s, you needed 4 1/4% growth,&quot; he says.                                                                                                          Not only is the labor force growing more slowly, butproductivity growth is lagging, in part because productivitygains normally come hardest in service jobs, whoselabor-force role keeps expanding. If productivity were togrow faster, employers could get by with fewer workers -- andunemployment would be higher.                                                                                                          The low unemployment rate seems especially strange whenheadlines tell of manufacturing layoffs. But manufacturingmay get more attention than it warrants nowadays. In largemeasure, this is because the numbers spinning fromWashington's statistics mills are overweighted with dataabout the factory economy, whose role on the business scenehas diminished over the years.   A glance at Pittsburgh is instructive. Like much ofmanufacturing, steel is in a slump. Yet, the Pittsburgharea's unemployment rate is below the national average andhas risen only slightly in recent months. The explanation isthat only 3% of the area's jobs are still tied to steel. Infact, manufacturing of all kinds accounts for less than 14%of the area's jobs, down from 25% a decade ago.   While factories across the country have cut payrolls, therest of the economy has created more than 2.7 million jobs inthe past year. The ups and downs of interest rates or thedollar may trouble many manufacturers, but such movementsgenerally mean less to hospitals or fast-food outlets.   As an indicator of overall economic conditions, theunemployment rate is far from perfect. It counts only peoplelooking for jobs and ignores those who have lost hope of everfinding work or have been forced to retire early.                                                                                                          Right now, moreover, the numbers are unusually muddled.The Labor Department's monthly survey of households, fromwhich the jobless rate is calculated, found 1.25 million morepeople with jobs in March 1990 than in March 1989. Butemployers report that they added almost twice as many in thesame 12 months. Even allowing for a big increase inmoonlighting -- which swells the employers' tallies withoutboosting the count from the household survey -- thediscrepancy is a mystery.                                                                                                          The national unemployment rate is, in addition, an averagethat masks high joblessness in some regions. But as long asweakness in New England, say, is offset by improvement inTexas, the overall jobless rate may not change, and the Fed'sstated strategy is to achieve just such a balance.   A low rate of unemployment, it should be added, can makethe Fed's job somewhat easier, since if joblessness is low,the Fed is usually under less political pressure to push downinterest rates.</TEXT></DOC>
