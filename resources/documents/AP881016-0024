Lewis Dischner, 70, and Carl Mathisen, 55, are charged withbribery, extortion and other crimes stemming from their involvementwith the North Slope Borough, the Eskimo-led government for thevast northern region of Alaska.   They are accused of scheming to influence the awarding ofcontracts during the borough's $1.2 billion public worksconstruction effort during the administration of borough MayorEugene Brower from 1981 to 1984. The project included schools,health clinics, airports, utilities and streets in the borough'sseven villages.   Dischner worked as a lobbyist for the North Slope Borough, whileMathisen worked as a public works consultant to Brower.   ``This is a case about fraud, bribery, kickbacks, extortion andcorruption,'' said U.S. Attorney Michael Spaan as Dischner's andMathisen's trial opened Friday before a U.S. District Court jury.   Testimony is expected to begin Monday.   Dischner and Mathisen used their influence to defraud theborough of $21 million, Spann said, and they were able to do itthrough Brower, the young and inexperienced mayor they helped elect.   ``This influence was based on friendship and trust and wascemented by bribery,'' Spaan said.   But Dischner's attorney, Douglas Pope, said the case was brought``because the prosecution misunderstands the situation on the NorthSlope.''   The government is confused about the law, he said, and theduties that Dischner had as lobbyist and adviser to Brower and hispublic works program.   ``This is a case about a man, Lew Dischner, with a strong senseof values, a strong sense of what is right, being unfairlyprosecuted for his strong commitment to his dream.''   That dream, said Pope, was that the Inupiat Eskimos of the NorthSlope deserved the same basic standard of living and opportunity towork enjoyed by the rest of Alaska and America.   ``Life on the North Slope was as savage as those of us wouldimagine it would be. The weather was cruel there,'' said LaurenceFinegold, Mathisen's attorney.   Mathisen helped bring dramatic, if expensive changes, hisattorney said.   ``I'm not saying the permafrost is flowing with milk and honeyas a result of the work of Carl Mathisen and Eugene Brower, but itis more livable now.''   Brower and other officials were also indicted as a result of afederal investigation into the public works program. Brower, two ofhis administrators and two engineeers have pleaded guilty tovarious charges in a plea-bargain arrangement and will testify forthe prosecution.   Dischner and Mathisen are accused of bribing Brower and otherborough officials with boats, cash, clothing and a $45,000 diamondring; demanding kickbacks totaling $9 million from six contractorsdoing business in the borough; taking an additional $9 millionthrough companies they themselves controlled; and extortingadditional money from other contractors.</TEXT></DOC>
