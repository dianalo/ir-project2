It isa 7.8-m automated tower with a 20-kW carbon induction furnace, and sufficientroom for two UV coating stages, or a UV coating stage and a thermal-curingstage. The tower installation took perhaps somewhat more time than initiallyanticipated, largely due to difficulties in the site preparation. Thetower itself was installed on a reinforced-concrete pad, with appropriatevibration isolation. Experience was gained in the use of the tower, andkilometer lengths of fiber were drawn that range in diameter from 50to 250 microns, with a tolerance of the order of a few microns. In anticipationof expanding the coating capabilities of the draw tower, a vacuum systemwas purchased for use with radio-frequency sputtering on-line on thetower. This will be particularly useful for ceramic-coated fibers inthe study of the behavior of fiber-strengthened composite materials.</TEXT></DOC>
