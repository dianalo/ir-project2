Government and ruling party sources, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said Roh was expected to announce the reshuffle nextmonth. The reorganization could affect up to 70 senior officials,they said.   ``To resolve the discontent of the opposition, we realize thequality of the shake-up is very important, and it is highly likelythat we would have a civilian defense minister,'' one governmentofficial said.   A well-placed source in the governing Democratic Justice Partyconfirmed the plans. ``President Roh really means business, and hewants to reflect the opposition's view as much as possible,'' hesaid.   In a nationally televised speech Saturday, Roh appealed to thenation to forgive his disgraced predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, andpromised speedier democratic reform, including a major shake-up ofhis government and party to assuage public anger over the formerstrongman's rule.   Chun, who stepped down in February, went into rural exile lastWednesday after coming under mounting attacks for corruption andabuse of power under his seven-year rule. He surrendered all hisproperty, worth $24 million, in a gesture of atonement, but hasdenied any personal guilt.   Opposition leaders refused to accept Roh's plea for mercy forChun and called for a thorough probe by the National Assembly or aspecial prosecutor. Thousands of people have staged street proteststo demand Chun's arrest.   Faced with the opposition's cool response, government andgoverning party officials are hoping that major democratic reformspromised in Roh's speech, including a government shake-up, willeffect a breakthrough.   Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jae is likely to be retained, but mostkey economic officials held over from Chun's administration,including Economic Planning Minister Rha Woong-bae, would bereplaced, they said.   Most significant would be the possible replacement of DefenseMinister Oh Ja-bok, a retired four-star general, with a civilian whohas no military background, the sources said.   The last time South Korea had a civilian defense minister was in1960, when the late President Park Chung-hee staged a military coupand ousted a popularly elected government led by then Prime MinisterChang Myun.   Since the 1960 coup, South Korea has been governed by formergenerals. Roh, also an former general, succeeded Chun in Februaryafter winning elections last December. But his government is closelyidentified with the military establishment.   Roh also pledged to release all political prisoners, reinstatethousands of illegally purged officials and compensate families ofvictims of the bloody government suppression of the 1980 civiluprising in southern Kwangju city that, by official count, leftabout 200 people dead. Activists say the toll was much higher.</TEXT></DOC>
