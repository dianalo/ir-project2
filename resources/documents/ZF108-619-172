Ted Hoff got the whole thingstarted back in 1971 when he presented Intel with the idea that led to theintroduction of the four chip Intel 4004 set.andP;  It had a 4-bit data bus, couldaddress 4.5Kb of memory, and had 45 instructions.andP;  Two decades on, and thesame company is talking in terms of a microprocessor that has upwards of 2mtimes the MIPS rating - although the underlying rationale is essentially thesame.andP;  The 80486 is very much Intel's sacred cash cow at the moment.andO;Although rival chip-maker Motorola Inc tried to steal a march on Intel byannouncing its 68040 processor - the same generation as the 80486 - just afew days before Intel lifted the veil on its hottest new part back in Aprillast year, the company has been unable to compete with Intel's lead times tosilicon.andP;  Apricot Computers had an 80486 system out later in the same yearbut problems with the 68040 have sent shipment dates slipping and sliding,leaving system builders struggling along with only sample quantities of thechip.andM;Micro 2000andM;Volume deliveries of the 68040, even to Motorola's largest customers likeHewlett-Packard will not begin before this autumn.andP;  Meanwhile Intel has beenquietly putting the finishing touches to its plans for a microprocessorarchitecture dubbed Micro 2000 that will take it up to the turn of thecentury and beyond.andP;  By this time the company envisages a part with up to100m transistors on a 1&quot; die with 2Mb of cache, running at 250MHz, performing2,000 MIPS - and fully compatible with the 80386.andP;  Going by the releasetimetable for the iAPX-86 line, this is around the time an 80786 would be dueto make an appearance.andP;  The current 80486 has 1.2m transistors, and the 80786will be preceded by an 80586 chip in 1992 with 4m or 5m transistors, and an80686 in 1996 with many more transistors again.andP;  Intel is confident that asteady and predictable stream of technological advances will deliverpractical devices for achieving its goals.andP;  The total number of transistorsthat can be crammed onto a given area has been steadily increasing, resultingin a continuous reduction in device dimensions.andP;  Intel says it has alreadyproduced sub-micron components in the labs - down to 0.1 micron size.andP;  It isalso relying on improved manufacturing processes to reduce the number ofdefects per square centimetre of silicon, making larger die sizes possible,and with larger parts, an increase in the number of transistors per die toaround 50m by the year 2000, and 100m in the future.andP;  Its vision is afour-processor CPU, each having 5m transistors, two vector units with another5m transistors apiece, another 5m used to make up a self-test unit, 2m forthe bus unit, 40m for cache requirements and a further 20m for delivering theuser interface, including Intel's Digital Video Interface technology.andM;By William FellowsandM;By comparison, even though one of today's 80386 personal computers has onlyabout 525,000 transistors, its power is equivalent to that of a minicomputerthat would have cost up to $250,000 five or six years ago.andP;  The possibleclock rate is dependent on a range of factors: power consumption, packaging,interconnect technology and transistor current drive.andP;  The faster the thinggoes and the more power it consumes, the hotter it gets and the moreunreliable it becomes.andP;  Intel says it will be using four or more multiplelayer interconnections to optimise clock signal routing within the chip, onmaterial with a lower restivity than those used today.andP;  With smallercomponent sizes, increased drive capability and channel lengths as small as0.1 micron, the firm expects to realise clock rates in excess of 250MHz.andO;Intel stands by a maxim that one of its researchers - Pat Gelsinger -outlined in the Micro 2000 white paper - &quot;every good idea proven in themainframe or minicomputer migrates onto the microprocessor&quot; - citing memorymanagement on mainframes in the 1970s that was delivered on the 80286, andthe paged virtual memory on late 1970s VAXes that is now found in mostcommercial microprocessors.andP;  The integration of these features intomicroprocessors occurs - or is focused - when successive performancebottlenecks are found.andP;  With each generation of mainframes, the next systembottleneck migrates onto the microprocessor.andP;  Intel predicts the next refugeewill be multiprocessors.andP;  Multiple processors are used on mainframes andminis - now even on micros - to extend performance, eventually multiple CPUswill be incorporated on to a single die.andP;  Furthermore, it is already possibleto execute two or three instructions per clock cycle today, and Intel isworking on getting down to 0.2 or 0.3 clocks per instruction by the turn ofthe century.andP;  These architectural enhancements, together with a 250MHz clockcycle should mean a single CPU will perform at around 700 MIPS - four on asingle die going to 2,000 MIPS.andP;  If all this makes existing microprocessorslook like museum pieces - before we've even got properly to grips with them -what is to become of the vast quantities of application software that arecurrently available for the iAPX-86 chip family? Do we throw it all away, orre-write the whole lot when Micro 2000, 80786 or whatever it will be calledeventually arrives? Will Intel be able to offer compatibility across thisextended time span?andM;East German TrabantandM;For an industry that loves to draw on nomenclature from the motor world, it'slike comparing a smoky old East German Trabant with the newest and fastestmodel BMW can offer.andP;  But even they are now driving side by side on the sameautobahns - despite the fact that the two Germanys are aeons apart intechnological development.andP;  Intel maintains that the burden of compatibilitywill not be a problem.andP;  It reckons that the amount of on-chip space that'llbecome available with the advances described should mean that compatibilitywith previous implementations will be a problem that shrinks in size as far aprocessor development is concerned.andP;  In addition it should allow what are nowoff-chip features - such as local area network and disk controllers, serialand parallel ports - to be integrated on a single processor, which would seeall of a personal computer's present functionality implemented on a singlechip - that could be done now with the 8086 if not the 80286: why hasn'tIntel done it already? The massive increases in power that these developmentslook set to deliver will, says Intel's microcomputer components grouppresident Dave House, give a tremendous boost to the scope for developing -and using - artificial intelligence, neural networks and, most importantly,the friendly user interfaces that have been missing for so long.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
