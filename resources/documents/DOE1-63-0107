In these systems treatment beamsare not constrained to be co-planar and dose calculation algorithms usuallyaccount for scatter and inhomogeneities in all three dimensions. Treatmentplans can be evaluated by displaying the relationship of the dose distributionand regions of interest for any arbitrary plane in the treatment volume.Modern minicomputers, CT scanners, and raster-scan imaging systems haveprovided the technology which now makes it possible to implement three-dimensionaltreatment planning.</TEXT></DOC>
