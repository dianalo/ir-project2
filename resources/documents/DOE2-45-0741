For the meat,livers and kidneys, the median values were 0.001, 0.003, and 0.007 mg/kg(fresh weight) for arsenic; 0.003, 0.054, and 0.098 mg/kg for cadmium;0.04, 0.85, and 0.36 mg/kg for lead; and 0.001, 0.002, and 0.007 mg/kgfor mercury. During the reported period, no clear trends were observed.The mercury and arsenic concentrations in meat and organs may be regardedas low, but the levels of lead in livers are relatively high. The leadconcentrations in livers showed seasonal fluctuations, the highest concentrationsusually being found during the winter. Significant linear relationshipswere found between the concentrations in livers and kidneys for arsenic,cadmium and mercury. Tissue trace element levels were not related tothe age of the investigated animals. (orig./ECB).</TEXT></DOC>
