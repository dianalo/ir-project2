(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An angry and bitter William Sterntestified Monday that Baby M should be kept from her biologicalmother for several years to protect the child from emotional harmand exploitation.   Stern, testifying in what is expected to be the final legalchapter of the 2-year-old dispute, characterized surrogate motherMary Beth Whitehead-Gould as untrustworthy and capable ofundermining his relationship with the child, legally known asMelissa Stern.   ``Mary Beth will do anything and say anything to get her way,''Stern said in 2{ hours of emotional testimony that ended with himcrying.   The hearing, expected to last several days, was ordered by theNew Jersey Supreme Court in its landmark Feb. 3 decision thatdeclared surrogacy-for-pay illegal and restored Mrs.Whitehead-Gould's parental rights, but left intact a judge's orderawarding custody of the child to the Sterns.   Stern and his wife, Elizabeth, of Tenafly, decided to have achild through a surrogate mother because they feared Mrs. Stern,42, who suffers from a mild form of multiple sclerosis, wouldsuffer complications during pregnancy.   Mrs. Stern testified the possibility of both sides cooperatingin the future was remote.   ``We don't share common values with Mary Beth, we don't thinkabout things in the same way and we don't react to situations inthe same way,'' Mrs. Stern testified. ``We are poles apart.''   The Sterns are seeking to cut off contact between Melissa andMrs. Whitehead-Gould, perhaps until the child's 10th birthday. Mrs.Whitehead-Gould now visits the child once a week for two hoursunder supervision at a children's social services center.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould is seeking two, eight-hour weekly visits ather home, later expanded to include weekends, half the summer andsome holidays. She was accompanied to court by her second husband,Wall Street accountant Dean Gould, with whom she is expecting achild.   The Sterns agreed to pay $10,000 to Mrs. Whitehead-Gould to bearthem a child and Mrs. Whitehead-Gould was artificially inseminatedwith Stern's sperm.   After the baby was born _ she turned 2 on Sunday _ Mrs.Whitehead-Gould changed her mind and refused to surrender the child.   In testimony Monday, Stern said Melissa should be protected,likening her to a sapling that needs to secure its roots.   ``If anything is done to interrupt those roots, I'm afraidMelissa does not have much of a future,'' said Stern, a biochemist.   He said that immediate contact with Mrs. Whitehead-Gould could``force Melissa into the situation where she would have to choosebetween us.''   Stern said he and his wife have formed a warm, lovingrelationship with Melissa. And his wife testified, `To preciouslittle Melissa, I know I'm her mother.''   Under two hours of cross-examination by Mrs. Whitehead-Gould'sattorney, Joel Siegal, Stern said he feared she would exploit thechild by writing a book that could lead to a photo of Melissa onthe book jacket, a film, a videocassette and even a promotionaltour for the book.   But Stern acknowledged that Melissa does not seem to have beenharmed so far by her contact with Mrs. Whitehead-Gould.   His testimony ended with questions from the judge on whatreligion the child would be exposed to. Stern, who is Jewish andwhose relatives other than his parents all died in the Holocaust,broke into tears. He drank a cup of water and composed himself,saying he expected to expose the child to a Unitarian church. Mrs.Stern is not Jewish.</TEXT></DOC>
