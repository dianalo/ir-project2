<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-83-0249 </DOCNO><TEXT>Stable cell lines expressing the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) precursorhave been prepared by transfection of mouse NIH 3T3 cells with a bovinepapillomavirus-based vector in which the human kidney EGF precursor cDNAhas been placed under the control of the inducible mouse metallothioneinI promoter. Synthesis of the EGF precursor can be induced by culturingthe cells in 5 mM butyric acid or 100 {mu}M ZnCl{sub 2}. The EGF precursorsynthesized by these cells appears to be membrane associated; none isdetectable in the cytoplasm. The size of the EGF precursor expressedby these cells is {approx} 150-180 kDa, which is larger than expectedfrom its amino acid sequence, suggesting that it is posttranslationallymodified, presumably by glycosylation. The EGF precursor was also detectedin the conditioned medium from these cells, indicating that some fractionof the EGF precursor synthesized by these transfected cells may be secreted.Preliminary data suggest that this soluble form of the EGF precursormay compete with {sup 125}I-labeled EGF for binding to the EGF receptor.These cell lines should be useful for studying the processing of theEGF precursor to EGF as well as determining the properties and possiblefunctions of the EGF precursor itself.</TEXT></DOC>
