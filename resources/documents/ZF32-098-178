The product may have trouble holding onwhen Microsoft comes out with its own integrated product this fall.andP;  Staytuned...andM;Merisel's list showed little movement at the top, but had some interestingnew entrants.andP;  FaceLift reappeared after flirting with the list in May andthen dropping out.andP;  PowerPoint appeared for the first time, showing that itis staving off the competition so far from Aldus's Persuasion and IBM'sHollywood.andP;  ObjectVision dropped out of the list.andP;  Maybe Borland's enormousinitial marketing push is losing steam (ObjectVision dropped a notch atEgghead).andM;Most of Egghead's best sellers retained their positions.andP;  PageMaker is backat number nine after dropping out briefly in July.andM;The Windows Watcher Quarterly rankings reflected minor shuffling on thelow-end.andP;  One new product appeared: After Dark showed up at a strong seventh.andM;Sources: Corporate Software, (617) 821-4500 Ingram Micro, (714) 540-4781Merisel, (213) 615-1230 Egghead Discount Software, (206) 391-6266andM;Windows Best SellersandM;Last month's rankings are in parentheses.andP;  Corporate Software Monthly 1.andO;Windows 3.0 (1) 2.andP;  Word for Windows (2) 3.andP;  Excel (3) 4.andP;  Office for Windows(6) 5.andP;  Project (5) 6.andP;  EXTRA!
