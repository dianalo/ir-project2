Methods for the determinationof discharges of volumes of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, sulfurdioxide, and hydrocarbons to air are discussed. In connection with theeffluents to water, the sampling procedures for the determination ofphysical/chemical parameters, main inorganic components, metals, heavymetals, general materials specifications, and some other specificationsof the chemical compositions are discussed. The equipments and methodsused for the ph and conductivity measurements are described. 3 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
