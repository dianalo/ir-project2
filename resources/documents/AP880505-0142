But he said Cosby, through his production company, did paysome money to the Jackson family company.   ``I was simply mistaken in terms of the Bill Cosby money,''longtime Jackson associate Frank Watkins said Wednesday, reversingan explanation he gave a day earlier as Jackson's presidentialcampaign released four years worth of his income tax returns.   Watkins said the $46,535 Jackson reportecome onhis 1987 tax return was honoraria paid directly to Jackson forspeaking engagements.d as business in   In addition, Jackson was paid $159,000 by PersonalitiesInternational, Inc., a company headed by his wife that receivedpayments for his other speaking engagements and publications.   Jackson is paid as an employee and consultant of the company butis not a corporate officer, Watkins said.   Watkins had said Cosby was the principal source of the $46,535,and that Jackson had performed unspecified services for the sum.   ``That was my mistake. They (Cosby and hdes today in a pre-dawn raidat theNowa Huta steel mill and arrested the leaders of a 10-day-oldstrike, official and church sources said.   An opposition leader said police beat and injured 41 people atthe huge plant in Krakow. The government said some work resumedthere after the crackdown.   At the Gdansk shipyard, site of another major work stoppage,communist authorities ordered a lockout, and police in full riotgear ringed the yard.   In Warsaw, the national spokesman for the outlawed independentSolidarity union federation was reported arrested. The governmentaccused strike leaders of trying to provoke a crisis in Poland'smost severe labor unrest since the 1981 military crackdown onSolidarity.   The government reported new strikes today among transit workersin the northwestern port of Szczecin and the nearby municipality ofPolice. Students also began a strike at Warsaw University.   ``The moment of the solution similar to that at Nowa Huta isapproaching,'' Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said in a tapedinterview smuggled out of the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk. In atense-sounding voice, he vowed to be ``the last to leave.''   In a communique, the shipyard strike committee had called onworkers to come to the yard: ``We continue the strike with afeeling of responsiblity for the shipyard and for the country.''   Hundreds of workers inside loudly chanted ``Solidarity,Solidarity,'' and sang religious songs and the national anthem.   Riot police turned away a crowd that gathered outside the yard,birthplace of Solidarity.   At Nowa Huta, police entered strike headquarters, detonatedpercussion grenades and arrested most strike committee members,said Krzystof Kozlowski, a senior Roman Catholic journalist inKrakow. Percussion grenades are designed to create a loud noise andno injury.   Later, riot police entered and ordered all strikers to leave.Half the plant's 32,000-worker force had been on strike.   ``Nobody suffered any harm or injury,'' government spokesmanJerzy Urban said in a telephone interview. State-run radio said atleast 38 people were arrested.   But Zygmunt Lenyk of the conservative opposition groupConfederation of Independent Poland said some strikers not detainedwere severely beaten. He said 32 people suffered cuts, eight peoplewere left unconscious and one man had two legs broken.   The official PAP news agency said some plant departments resumedwork while others remained idle so that maintenance work could bedone on equipment stopped ``without preparation'' during the strike.   On Wednesday, Urban had accused strike leaders of ``terrorist''tactics and threatened to use force if the ``anarchy'' continued.Today, he said Walesa and his followers want to ``evoke crisis''and he reiterated the government's refusal to negotiate withSolidarity activists.   Walesa said authorities were ``sinking our country into ruin.... I'm still convinced our strivings are right, and I can't behavein any different way.''   Dissident intellectual Adam Michnik, just released from twodays' detention, told reporters in Gdansk today that breaking theNowa Huta strike was ``the most foolish thing these authoritiescould do.''   ``This is the last nail in (Polish leader) General (Wojciech)Jaruzelski's political coffin,'' he said.   PAP said today that the Nowa Huta strike had threatened ``thefundamental interests of the society and national economy.''   It also quoted Gdansk shipyard management as saying workers notjoining the strike would be given paid leaves of absence.   About 7,000 workers at the 12,000-worker shipyard in the Balticport went on strike Monday, the fourth stoppage since the laborunrest began April 25.   The two other strikes were settled when the government agreed toincrease wages to offset price increases of 42 percent so far thisyear.   At Nowa Huta and Gdansk, strikers also demanded independentlocal unions, reinstatement of fired union activists and therelease of political prisoners.   Phones of opposition activists in the Krakow area appeared cutoff today, said Barbara Labuda, a Solidarity spokeswoman inWroclaw. Joanna Onyszkiewicz, wife of Solidarity national spokesmanJanusz Onyszkiewicz, said her husband was taken away by police fromhis Warsaw home this morning.   Just after midnight, strike leaders at Nowa Huta announced thatRoman Catholic Church mediators had persuaded management tonegotiate with strikers there later today. Strike leaders in Gdansksaid management there had refused to negotiate with them.   On Wednesday, the nation's Catholic bishops called onauthorities to seek common ground with aggrieved citizens.   Urban indicated on Wednesday that authorities might crack down.   ``We shall not allow any anarchy,'' he said on national radioand television. ``The two wildcat strikes have degenerated, and Iam warning, they may result in serious consequences.''   Urban accused strikers of coercing workers into honoring thestrikes at both plants and impeding deliveries of materials.   ``We are talking here about terrorist actions,'' he said.   Three times in postwar Poland, labor trouble has toppledgovernments.   Walesa, a 44-year-old electrician who won the 1983 Nobel PeacePrize, co-signed the 1980 accords that made Solidarity the onlyfree labor movement ever officially recognized in the Soviet bloc.</TEXT></DOC>
