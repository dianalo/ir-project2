The commissionwill continue to &quot;encourage, sponsor and actively participate in celebratingthe 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus charting a course to theAmericas,&quot; notes commission spokeswoman Tamara Clark-Shear, but afterdiscussions with native American groups, plans are being considered to&quot;provide a forum for native Americans to express their feelings about thequincentennial and support native American efforts to develop curricula toeducate local school students about native Americans.&quot; The sides will meetagain next Wednesday. Will asking the Indians what they think about what'sgoing on satisfy the critics? Probably not -- but it's more than Columbus did.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DISCOVERING A NEW, IMPROVED COLUMBUS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     ON THEIR TOES -- Karen Loewenstern, who heads the board of San JoseCleveland Ballet, will do some cross-pollinizing by also joining the MarthaGraham Dance Company's board of trustees, a group that includes suchluminaries as Jackie Onassis, Elizabeth Taylor, Gregory Peck, Betty Ford andLiza Minnelli. Loewenstern will attend the latter company's opening night galain New York, where Mikhail Baryshnikov is scheduled to perform; the Grahamgroup already is scheduled as part of the San Jose Cleveland season here March6-8. Any chance that Loewenstern will be able to lure Baryshnikov to the SanJose stage as she did for a San Jose Cleveland Ballet fund-raiser in 1985? Youjust know she'll be trying. . . . Help from high places, too, for San Josepianist Pamela Resch, who ran afoul of the law by staging recitals in herNaglee Park residence. Conservative commentator William F. Buckley Jr. haswritten to Mayor Susan Hammer in Resch's behalf, noting that &quot;I had theprivilege of hosting her concert in New York&quot; and urging Hammer to &quot;intervenein the matter and uphold the singular reputation San Jose enjoys as a townhospitable to fine artistic events.&quot; Hammer hasn't had to do much to upholdthat rep. Resch's most recent performance was in commercial concert space, notresidential, which should satisfy the law (and her neighbors).;   SWEETCHARITY -- Speaking of cross-pollination, Dr. Bill Langston of the CaliforniaParkinson's Foundation adds a high-tech twist to the $50,000 grant for a massspectrometer his group received from this year's Silicon Valley Charity Ballproceeds. &quot;Recently we received word that Hewlett-Packard has decided to morethan match this grant by contributing an equipment package valued at$143,790,&quot; Langston reports. &quot;Since the gift from the charity ball was acrucial part of our grant application to Hewlett-Packard, it would be fair tosay that, in the true entrepreneurial spirit of Silicon Valley, the grant fromthe Silicon Valley Charity Ball was 'leveraged' into an overall grant of$193,790.&quot; . . . The Parkinson's people also hope they're doing the rightthing by scheduling a $75-a-head fund-raiser Thursday night at Saratoga'sMountain Winery, featuring Ray Charles and Etta James. Right things arebrother Ray's specialty.;   UH HUH -- Under a new California law, employersnow must have written injury and illness prevention programs on file -- moreforms to keep the paper-shufflers occupied -- but Sunnyvale accountant LeonardWilliams figures the best anti-injury plan he's seen yet is this simple signhanging at the deli counter of a Safeway store on Hollenbeck Avenue: &quot;Be alert-- don't get hurt.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Leigh Weimers column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910904  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  585  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, September 4, 199100248108,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
