Maj. Augusto Villalaz, who was one of Noriega's personal pilots,says he flew three shipments of arms to Panama from Cuba and thatNoriega planned to import 500,000 pounds of weapons.   ``He located the arms outside the military installations, and hecan handle (them) with his people when he wants,'' Villalaz saidSunday on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley.''   Villalaz said Ortega's well-placed loyalists and big stash ofCuban weapons will enable him to remain in power, if he chooses,longer than U.S. officials seem to think.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz is among those predicting aquick end to Noriega's rule, claiming Sunday that the Panamanianmilitary is ``cracking open'' around Noriega.   ``The situation is that Noriega must leave sooner or later. Thesooner the better,'' Shultz said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.''   Shultz said U.S. indictments against Noriega on drug traffickingcharges would not be dropped and Noriega could not have any sayabout the government that would run Panama after his departure.   ``What he has to do is leave, and he should settle quicklybefore the opportunity that is there before him, to go to Spain,should disappear,'' Shultz said. Spain has offered Noriegapolitical asylum on the condition that the United States not seekhis extradition on the drug charges.   ``Increasingly, the military is cracking open and making itclear that they want him to leave,'' Shultz said, citing thedefection last week of Noriega's personal pilots, Villalaz and Maj.Ramon Adames.   Villalaz said last week's coup attempt against Noriega failedbecause an officer who was supposed ``to secure the commander oftroops'' protecting Noriega's headquarters failed to do so. He didnot give any other details about the coup attempt.   Villalaz acknowledged a Noriega claim that four of the fiveofficers involved in the plot against him received training in theUnited States last month, but he said no U.S. agency was involvedin the coup attempt.   In a telephone interview, Raul St. Malo, minister counselor withthe Panamanian embassy, said the pilots told anti-Noriega embassyofficials that 70 percent of military officers supported the coupattempt, but that Noriega has loyalists guarding the military'sfirepower. He said the anti-Noriega personnel include captains,majors and colonels in all branches of the service.   St. Malo said other defections of high-ranking officers areexpected ``very soon.'' He declined to give any details of thepilots' defection.   Villalaz described Noriega as a ``very complicated'' man whodoesn't talk very much. But he said Noriega is a strong leader andhas a hold on military people in key locations around the country.   ``He's fairly secure because he has the main places in the(country) with the weapon power ... the military weight,'' Villalazsaid.   Asked if he thought Noriega would ever agree to go into exile inSpain, the pilot said, ``I don't think so. He's a very strong man.''   Villalaz said that on Noriega's orders he flew three shipmentsof weapons from Cuba, stashing them in three locations around thecountry. He said 16 such flights were planned with a total of500,000 pounds of weapons to be put in place outside regularPanamanian military installations.   National security adviser Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, alsointerviewed on ABC, speculated that Noriega could be intending touse the Soviet-made arms to wage an insurgency of his own after heis deposed or for use elsewhere in Central America.   But he said he believes Noriega's future is dim.   ``He will leave, sooner or later,'' Powell said. ``We willcontinue to apply pressure. He is a tough individual. He will takeevery opportunity available to him to stay in power.''   Powell said he had no information about a report in Sunday'seditions of The Washington Post that federal law enforcementofficials wanted to indict Noriega eight years ago on charges ofillegally buying and transporting weapons but stalled out of fearit would upset Panama.   ``We had evidence to indict him for conspiracy, but ... theJustice Department didn't want it,'' Donald Kimbler, a former agentwith the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, told the Post.   In a separate interview Sunday, Panama's U.S. ambassador, JuanSosa, who supports ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle, said thatNoriega is in his last days of power and would fall this week.   ``He's not governing now, so either the military will continueto pressure to oust him, or he will go on himself,'' Sosa said inan interview on Cable News Network's ``Newsmaker Sunday.''</TEXT></DOC>
