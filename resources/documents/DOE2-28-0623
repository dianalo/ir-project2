The carbon monoxide (CO) diffusing capacity (DLCO)was not affected until the fourth day, when it dropped abruptly to 30%below control levels. Wet-lung weight/body weight ratios and wet-lung/dry-lungweight ratios increased, indicating the presence of edema. Exposuresto 2.7 mg/m3 ZnO, using the same 3 hr/day, 5 day time frame, did notalter any parameters measured. In 2 experiments a single high peak ofZnO (25-34 mg/m3) occurred. In one experiment exposure was stopped, butpulmonary function measurements were made as scheduled; in the othercase, exposures to ZnO were continued. In both, lung volumes were decreasedabruptly and to a greater extent than when peaks were absent. Continuedexposure caused greater decrements in total lung capacity (TLC) and vitalcapacity (VC) as well as decrements in functional residual capacity (FRC)and residual volume (RV) than were observed when exposure was stopped.Peak exposures reduced DLCO to 45%-60% below control. These values roseto 25%-30% below control with or without continued exposure. Airway resistanceincreased and compliance decreased following peak exposures. When exposurewas stopped, these changes were reversible; with continued exposure theystill were different from control levels on the fifth day.</TEXT></DOC>
