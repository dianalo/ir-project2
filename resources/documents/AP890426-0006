(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   No superheroes grace the pages ofJavier Juarez's comic books, no archvillains with maniacal plots tocontrol the world, and not a single ``Pow!'' ``Zap!'' or ``Bam!''   Even so, the black-and-white adventures of ``Felipe'' and hisfriends as they try to conquer a mountain of bureaucratic obstaclesto become legal U.S. residents may be the most dog-eared literaturein California.   Distributed free at employment offices, churches and socialservice agencies, the booklets are lessons in applying forresidency under the complex 1986 Immigration Reform and ControlAct, better known as the amnesty program.   ``Amnistia'' or ``Amnesty,'' about applying for temporaryresidency, was out of print soon after the release of 50,000 copiesa year ago. ``The Second Phase,'' about permanent residency andavoiding disqualification, is in its second printing four monthsafter distribution of the first 30,000 copies.   ``We've never had this kind of response with any materialbefore,'' said Emily Goldfarb, executive director of the SanFrancisco-based Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights andServices, which produced the books.   The potential audience in California exceeds 1.58 million, thenumber of applicants for residency status under the amnesty program.   ``All this subject matter is deadly boring if you aren'taffected by it. If you are affected by it, it's not deadly boring _it's terrifyingly boring,'' said Juarez, 39, a former Mexicangovernment economist who got the idea after he married a U.S.citizen and moved from Mexico City to California.   So Juarez lightened it up, capitalizing on the gallows humor andlove of storytelling he said is the heritage of Mexico, wherepolitical cartooning has enjoyed a long tradition and soapopera-style novellas are popular.   ``Lots of people say, `Why a comic book? That's for a kid or thementally retarded.' There's nothing comic about the situationsportrayed in the comic books. Actually, it's a matter of life anddeath. It's going to determine where they live and work. Butthere's no reason to lose your sense of humor.''   When the characters discuss the difficulties of obtainingdocuments and witnesses' sworn statements to prove they've been inthe country since Jan. 1, 1982 _ the cutoff date for amnestyapplications _ Felipe laments: ``Even my mother-in-law wanted touse the opportunity to get rid of me.''   The idea was so good that the Immigration and NaturalizationService, which had said it couldn't afford to produce Juarez'sbook, followed suit. The government version also proved popular,said Scott Nyborn, outreach coordinator with the INS in SanFrancisco. ``I don't think we have any left, actually.''   Juarez writes the scripts in Spanish, then translates them forEnglish editions. A former student of dramatic arts, he gets helpwith illustrations from his media-wise family _ his father works inadvertising, his brother in film-making, and his sister is atelevision director in Mexico.   He strives to write the scripts in the idioms of everydaySpanish, while accurately imparting information about the amnestyprogram _ a task that can be a ``nightmare'' because expertsfrequently disagree on the complex law.   Goldfarb believes that unlike with government brochures, peoplehang onto the comics and read them aloud to their families,reaching illiterate people who otherwise might be misinformed orexploited by swindlers.   ``They're fun to read,'' she said. ``The graphics and theconversations and the cultural aspects of it are things that peoplecan identify with.''   ``Amnistia'' dealt with the first phase of the amnesty program,but applying for residency is just the first step. The applicationdealines were May 5, 1988, for aliens here since 1982 and Nov. 30for seasonal agriculture workers who had picked perishable crops atleast 90 days between May 1985 and May 1986.   The second phase deals with permanent residency and problemslike arrests, unemployment and welfare dependancy that can makeapplicants ineligible.   Two more issues are in the works to address mandated AIDS tests;qualifying for government assistance including free andreduced-price school lunches and prenatal and infant medical care,and meeting requirements for a basic understanding of English, andAmerican civics and history.   If the next issue wins a state grant, Goldfarb said theImmigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition plans to print 70,000 copiesfor distribution by its 80 nonprofit member organizations in theSan Francisco Bay area, then make it available to otherorganizations throughout the state to reprint.   Juarez said the widespread readership is its own reward and hasinspired him to try producing as his next project an analyticalSpanish-English language magazine for California's rapidly growingHispanic population.</TEXT></DOC>
