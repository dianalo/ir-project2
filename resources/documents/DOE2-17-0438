The goal is to establish an algorithmthat handles these problems in an integrated framework, so that the solutionaddresses both problems simultaneously. A model for traffic flow in thecommunication network considering the effect of communication delaysand a generalization of traditional network performance indices is described.A three-level hierarchical solution procedure based on local controland the exchange of coordinating information between nodes is developed.The iterative algorithm provides feasible, but suboptimal, solutionsso that it can be used for online control while improving the networkperformance index. The algorithm provides a complete decomposition ofthe solution at the lowest level of the hierarchy so that a very generalset of constraint conditions can be easily formulated and solved usingthe model. A periodic optimization procedure that permits the algorithmto be applied over time periods larger than the basic optimization horizon,and which provides adaptability to errors in the modeling of networktraffic demands is also presented. Computer programs for the algorithmincorporating various buffer and flow-control options and a network simulatorare developed.</TEXT></DOC>
