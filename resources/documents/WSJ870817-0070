Use an ATM and get a coupon for a free hamburger. Or get a chance to win a free trip.    The party's over. Financial institutions increasingly are charging anywhere from 25 cents to $2 for ATM cash withdrawals, deposits and transfers.    &quot;Banks are being squeezed between what they must pay for funds and what they are charging,&quot; says John Love, publisher of Bank Network News, a Chicago-based newsletter. &quot;They're starting to charge for services that they formerly gave away.&quot;    But Mr. Love and others question whether banks have priced their ATM fees too high and are thus jeopardizing their long-term interests. &quot;I find an inconsistency in the logic of charging more for an electronic funds transaction than a paper check,&quot; says Mr. Love. &quot;People will pay for the convenience of an ATM, but not an excessive amount like 75 cents or one dollar. That's an outrage.&quot;    Banks originally installed ATMs because they are less costly than human tellers. To coax depositors into using them regularly, banks initially didn't charge for their use.    But now some 40% to 60% of customers use ATMs regularly, and banks say it's time to start covering the costs. &quot;Why shouldn't people pay for the convenience?&quot; asks Thomas Honey, executive vice president of the Consumer Bankers Association, a Washington, D.C., trade group. &quot;There's no efficiency for a bank in using ATMs for deposit-taking. Humans still have to take the deposit out and count it.&quot;    Banks levy the highest fees for &quot;foreign&quot; transactions at ATMs owned by another bank but linked to the customer's bank through a local or national network. About 40% of banks now charge such fees. They justify the charges by saying they are simply recovering the fees that they, themselves, pay to the ATM network and the other bank that owns the ATM.    Banks no longer are willing to absorb such costs. Starting July 15, for instance, Pittsburgh National Bank's ATM customers began paying $4, for which they receive a card good for 100 transactions on the bank's MAC machines. But if the customer uses an ATM at another bank in the multibank PLUS network, the charge is $2 for a cash withdrawal and $1.25 for any other transaction.    A spokesman says that a few customers have turned in their ATM cards rather than pay the fees, but that the number is far fewer than the bank anticipated.    Banks aren't the only ones charging for ATM use. Users of Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.'s Discover credit card are charged $1.75 when they use a bank ATM for a cash advance, and American Express cardholders pay $1.50 for the same transaction.    One of the few areas where banks generally haven't begun charging an ATM fee is New York City. (One exception: Citibank, which levies a 25-cent fee on customers of accounts with cumulative balances less than $1,000.) Bankers blame the absence of fees on intense competition in New York plus the comparatively late arrival of shared ATM networks.    Still, the trend toward ATM fees isn't inexorable. MCorp, a Texas-based bank holding company, recently dropped fees to customers who used its 1,100 MPact machines at banks and supermarkets. But customers tapping their MBank accounts by using Pulse network machines will continue to pay $1.25 a transaction.    An MCorp spokesman calls the decision to drop the fees &quot;a retail pricing decision; we want to encourage customers to use our system over Pulse,&quot; a competing network of 4,200 ATM's in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.    Some argue that excessively high fees will boomerang on banks by discouraging usage. Already, Mr. Love of Bank Network News maintains, the growth in ATM use has slowed partly as a result of the fees (saturation of the market is another factor in the slower growth rate). Last year, he says, there were 3.5 billion ATM transactions, up only 2% from 1985.    Mr. Love contends that if consumers get out of the habit of using ATM cards, banks could be at a disadvantage when they try to expand ATM cards into debit cards for retail purchases. &quot;By charging so much for ATM transactions,&quot; he says, &quot;banks are going against their own economic long-term interests.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
