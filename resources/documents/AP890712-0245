Chase stood alone among the nation's large money-center banksMonday in trimming its prime rate a half percentage point to 10.5percent, the second such decline in as many months and the level atwhich the prime stood at the start of the year.   Other major banks generally were expected to follow the move _which Chase said reflected its own declining costs of borrowing _but had not done so by late Tuesday.   Reflecting the banks' dropping costs of funds, the average yieldon six-month certificates of deposit fell to 8.79 percent last weekfrom 8.84 percent the previous week. Thirty-year fixed mortgagerates dropped to an average 10.17 percent, a 14-month low, accordingto HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J.-based mortgage research firm.   In addition, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond dipped to7.97 percent at one point Tuesday _ the lowest level since April 8,1987, according to Camilli _ before closing up at 8.03 percent.   The prime, a laggard among other interest rates, is a benchmarkbanks use to set interest on a variety of consumer and businesscredit, including home-equity lines of credit. It also determinesthe rate for many credit cards.   Economists said Tuesday that other banks undoubtedly have seenreductions in their cost of funds in recent weeks but that theyprobably want to wait until the Federal Reserve further eases itscredit policies before they cut their prime rates.   The Fed has shown signs of loosening its grip on the nation'smoney supply in reaction to a continued slowdown in economic growthand an easing of inflation.   The federal funds rate, which reflects the Fed's credit moves,dipped as low as 8~ percent last week after hovering around 9{percent. But economists said most banks probably won't cut theirprime until fed funds remains firmly at the 9 percent level. Fedfunds _ the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans _closed at 9 3-16 percent late Tuesday.   Some economists also said slow summer business may have delayedwidespread prime cuts.   ``I think they are dragging their feet in lowering the primebecause activity has dropped off a little bit this summer, and oneway of earning profits is to keep the spread wide,'' said WardMcCarthy, an economist and principal with Stone andamp; McCarthy ResearchAssociates Inc.   ``When rates drop banks tend to lag, whereas they're much quickerto increase the prime when rates are rising,'' he said.   By spread, McCarthy means the difference between the banks' costof borrowing and lending money.   Some economists said prime cut delays also might be due to thefact that a number of key decision makers at the major banks are onvacation.   ``I know at least one bank where that's true,'' said one sourceat Chase.   Elliott Platt, an economist with Donaldson Lufkin andamp; JenretteSecurities Corp., said the Fed probably will push the fed funds rateto 9 percent once a spate of new economic data is released laterthis month.   The producer price index, industrial production, retail sales andcapacity utilization figures for June are scheduled for releaseFriday, and many analysts predicted those numbers would point to afurther economic slowing.</TEXT></DOC>
