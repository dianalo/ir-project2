Guillermo Ungo, candidate of the leftist Democratic Convergence,said Tuesday that those factors and a rebel boycott of the votecombined to give the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, orArena, victory on Sunday.   Fighting that has convulsed the nation for nine years flared anewlate Tuesday when leftist rebels attacked the country's main prisonin Mejicanos, just north of San Salvador, in an apparent attempt tofree comrades.   Three prisoners and one guard were wounded, authorities said.   Prison commander Vitelio Ramos said about 300 rebels attacked the1,800-inmate prison with assault rifles and rocket-propelledgrenades, but were unable to penetrate its 12-foot cinderblock wall.They did, however, manage to cut through a 10-foot wire fence aroundthe complex.   Mariona, which rebels have attacked several times a year, housesseveral dozen political prisoners.   Leftist rebels, who have been fighting U.S.-backed governmentsince 1980, declared a traffic ban, sabotaged the electrical powersystem and boycotted Sunday's vote, which was won by Arena'scandidate, coffee baron Alfredo Cristiani.   There was widespread combat on election day, with threejournalists among the more than 30 people authorities said werekilled.   Arena, well financed and organized, is the country's leadingpolitical force now, having won a majority in the LegislativeAssembly a year ago and already in control of the judiciary.   But election turnout was the lowest of the decade, said electionofficials.   Ricardo Perdomo, chairman of the Central Elections Council, said``about 900,000'' of El Salvador's 1.83 million voters participated.   With 576,339 votes counted in the official tally, Arena had 53.8percent, the outgoing Christian Democrats 36.6 percent and thecenter-right National Conciliation Party 4.2. Ungo's DemocraticConvergence, which had hoped to run a strong third, polled just 3.2percent. Official results were expected Thursday.   Ungo said the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front hadseriously erred by trying to disrupt the election ``and in doing sofavored Arena.''   The Convergence is a coalition of three leftist parties alliedwith the rebels, but the guerrilla anti-election campaign strainedthat alliance.   Candidate Fidel Chavez Mena of the Christian Democrats, the partyof President Jose Napoleon Duarte, said ``the most important thingwas the abstention.'' Cristiani will on June 1 take over fromDuarte, who is dying of liver cancer and by law could not run forre-election.   At a news conference in Mexico City, the rebels argued that thelow turnout means Arena, which has in the past been linked to deathsquad activity, lacks a mandate.   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said peoplewho worry about human rights abuses in El Salvador ``ought to givethis new government a chance to prove itself before we startcondemning it in some sort of knee-jerk fashion.''   An estimated 70,000 people have been killed in the civil war.More than half the victims were civilians, and most of those deathsare attributed to security forces or right-wing death squads.   Arena was founded by Roberto d'Aubuisson, a former army majordismissed from the service for allegedly plotting a coup. He hasbeen linked to the death squads, but denies involvement.   Ungo, former head of the rebel alliance's political bureau,described many of his coalition's supporters as the rural poor whofear the military and remember the death squads of the early 1980s.   ``There were too many soldiers at the polls, and people wereafraid,'' said Ungo, who returned from exile to head the firstleftist ticket in more than a decade.   Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a member of the rebel politicalcommission, said in Mexico City the guerrillas accept responsibilityfor the poor showing of the Convergence: ``Those were our voters whostayed away.''</TEXT></DOC>
