Description of the Benefits QC Program The Unemployment Insurance Benefits Quality Control program became mandatoryin all 52 State Employment Security Agencies (SESAs) on October 5, 1987with the publication at 20 CFR Part 602 of the final regulation to establisha permanent Quality Control program for the Federal-State UnemploymentInsurance system. This program examines paid claims only. It does not addressdenied claims or revenue functions at this time. Calendar year 1988 representedthe first full year of operation of the mandatory program. The QC program consists of a continuing comprehensive review of a statewideprobability sample of UI payments to assess the accuracy of the State'spayment process. Each week a sample of original intrastate payments madefor a week of unemployment is randomly selected. The relevant populationexcludes supplemental payments, waiting weeks, interstate payments, andextended benefits. An audit of the selected claims is conducted by State QC staff. The QCstaff examines all aspects of a claimant's eligibility to receive unemploymentcompensation during the sampled week. The investigation includes, but isnot limited to, verifications of wages used to establish monetary entitlements,the claimant's reason for being unemployed, and efforts to find work duringthe week. The findings are then numerically coded and entered into a microcomputerlocated in each State. The data collected in accordance with these procedures enables the QC programto meet its primary objective of strengthening the controls that preventerrors and/or fraud and abuse in the payment of UI benefits. QC providesboth Federal and SESA administrators with a management system for accuratelymeasuring the rate of incorrect payments, the reasons for incorrect payments,and a basis for reducing incorrect payments in each State. Identificationof specific types, causes, and responsibility for errors provides informationabout the effectiveness of State programs and the quality of their underlyingpolicies, thereby serving as a basis to improve and strengthen programoperations. QC data should lead State and national program managers tomake significant program improvements resulting in dollar savings, andcontinuing benefit payment integrity.One of the several consensus principles accepted by the Department, andembodied in the QC regulation (andSection;602.43) is that the Departmentwill use neither sanctions nor funding incentives to influence the Statesto take actions to achieve particular error rates. Instead, QC is to servea public information function. The regulation, at andSection;602.21(g), requiresthat States release QC results at the same time each year using a standardizedformat. States released results of the QC program for CY 1988 to the publicin June 1989 and the Department published a compendium of the releasesin July.2. The Secretary's ResponsibilitiesWhile the consensus principles as outlined in the regulation governingQC provide that no sanctions or funding incentives would be used to forcethe achievement of specified error rates under QC, the regulation providesfor specific measures to be applied in cases where the States fail to adequatelyadminister the QC program in accordance with required methods and procedures.The QC Regulation requires the Department to take action when QC programoperations are not consistent with Handbook No. 395 and the annual fundingallocations.Section 602.31, Oversight, of the QC Regulation (20 CFR part 602) requiresthe Department of Labor to annually review the adequacy of the administrationof a State's QC program for purposes of determining eligibility for grants.The Department is committed to ensuring the integrity and utility of thedata collected by the QC program so that it can properly serve its Statemanagement and Federal oversight functions. There is concern, therefore,when a State does not sample at a level that will provide sufficient datato conduct anaylsis and establish sufficiently precise estimates of errorrates.The Department has identified three areas of QC operations that are keyto optimal program operation where failure to perform represents inadequaciesin administration. These areas are: failure to sample at the allocatedlevel for the year; failure to sample for a week(s) or sampling below theweekly allowable minimum; and failure to complete the required percentageof cases within the established case completion timeframes. These areasrepresent the measures used to ensure the key features of precision, coverageand timeliness. These three quantifiable areas were selected because thequality of investigation and therefore of the QC program can be essentiallymeasured by these indicators. QC results need to be accurate to properlyguide State corrective actions and to insure that accurate data is beingreleased to the public. It is for these three areas that the Departmentwill determine whether repayment of QC administrative funds will be expectedwhen standards for these areas are not met.3. Statistical Basis for the QC Program<ITAG tagnum="81">a. Precision of estimates of errors</ITAG>Precision is the degree an estimate from a sample can be expected to deviatefrom the expected value (average) obtained from repeated samples. The largerthe sample, the greater the precision. Thus, to estimate the rate of thepayment error in a population with a sufficient degree of precision, Statesmust sample and complete enough cases. Within its fiscal constraints, theDepartment has allocated via the Program Budget Plan sample sizes thatare set at levels that will result in acceptably precise estimates of paymenterrors. States with larger UI case loads_where errors have larger dollarconsequences_have been allocated larger sample sizes in order to obtainprecise estimates of errors in subgroups of their more diverse populations.They are also allocated additional resources to enable these States toperform more extensive analyses.<ITAG tagnum="81">b. Coverage</ITAG>Coverage refers to the ability to make estimates for the entire population(52 weeks of UI payment decisions), and not just selected portions of thepopulation. Thus QC procedures require that a minimum number of cases besampled each week to ensure coverage of each week's (batch's) activity.Failure to sample for one or more weeks results in the inability of a Stateto draw inferences about a portion of the population. Loss of coveragewill obscure seasonal and cyclical fluctuations in QC data and lessen itsusefulness as a management tool.<ITAG tagnum="81">c. Timeliness</ITAG>The preceding categories are intended to ensure that samples reflect withadequate precision (i.e. small enough error due to the variability fromone sample to another) the entire population of UI payments. Timelinessof case completion is necessary to minimize non-sampling error i.e., errorsin the verification of QC cases. If too much time passes between the timea case is selected for review and the actual investigation, the informationobtained may be of less quality than if it is gathered in a timely manner.The respondents (claimants, employers, and third parties) may have difficultyremembering where the work research was conducted, whether or not the claimantactually inquired about employment of an employer, et cetera. The currenttimelapse criterion of 95% case completion within 90 days is intended togive the investigator enough time to complete a thorough investigationbut ensure it is done before respondents' recall weakens.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Statement of the Problem</ITAG>Review of selection and timelapse performance data for CY 1988 indicatesproblems in some States in the key areas of precision, coverage and timeliness.Twenty eight SESAs did not meet the sample allocation for CY 1988 (precision).In addition, thirty-nine SESAs did not meet the 90-day case completionstandard for CY 1988 (timeliness). The selection of the proper sample andtimely investigation of the selected cases should lead to quality investigations.Failure to sample at the allocated level makes it difficult for a Stateto conduct analysis and establish error rates that are sufficiently preciseto take the proper corrective actions. Failure to investigate cases ina timely manner casts doubt on the accuracy of the information gatheredduring the investigation.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Options for Administrative Actions</ITAG>1. Options for Addressing Failure To Sample at the Required Level for theCalendar Year (Precision)<ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion</ITAG>Each year funding is provided to State Employment Security Agencies (SESAs)to investigate the number of cases assigned to them. The primary reasonfor sampling under the UI/QC program is for the purposes of: (1) Drawinginferences about the total caseload, and (2) utilizing the results fromthe weekly samples to develop corrective action plans that will eliminateerrors in the total caseload.Several factors that reflect a State's diversity and complexity were consideredin determining State sample sizes, including measures of the populationsize (number of weeks compensated), measures of the potential population(covered employment), and geographic area. For example, the State of Californiais assigned 2000 cases while the State of Delaware is assigned 500 cases.The funding is predicated on the assumption that one investigator can completeapproximately 100 cases in a one-year period (about two cases per week).States are allocated sample sizes necessary to produce accurate error ratesand to allow them to identify and remove special causes of variation inthe system. States are also able to measure the effects of corrective actionsthrough analysis of subsequent QC findings.In calendar year 1988, 28 SESAs did not complete the number of cases assignedto them. One of the primary reasons for not meeting the required samplinglevels was the difficulty encountered in hiring up to increased staff.This problem has been resolved and it should not recur in calendar year1989 since the sample levels will not be increased.<ITAG tagnum="81">Option No. I: Floor of 50 Cases_Flat Rate</ITAG>Under this option, SESAs would be required to repay the Department at therate of one full time position equivalent (FTE) for each 100 cases notsampled in the calendar year. However, the repayment requirement wouldnot be instituted until the number of cases undersampled exceeded 50. Therationale for establishing this floor beyond which SESAs would not haveto reimburse the Department is that a cutoff should be established in recognitionof unforeseen administrative problems that could befall SESAs within ayear.<ITAG tagnum="81">Option No. II: Floor of Five Percent </ITAG>Under this option, the SESAs would not be required to repay the Departmentuntil they reached a fixed percentage of cases not sampled. This wouldtranslate to a varying cutoff point for each SESA depending upon its assignedsample size. The rationale for establishing a floor of five percent isthat the sample size varies so greatly that all SESAs should not be treatedin the same manner. In practice, a State with a sampling level of 1500cases would be subject to repayment when it reached 75 cases (1500andmultiply;.05=75).In contrast, a State with a sampling level of 600 cases would be subjectto repayment when it exceeded 30 cases (600andmultiply;.05=30).<ITAG tagnum="81">Option No. III: No Floor </ITAG>Under this option, all SESAs would be required to repay the Departmentfor any portion of their assigned allocation which they did not achieve.If a SESA undersampled by 50 cases, the SESA would have to reimburse theDepartment for one half of a FTE. The rationale for this option is thatthe SESA is receiving funding to accomplish the task. If the task is notcompleted, repayment would be required.2. Options for Failure to Sample for a Week(s) (Coverage) <ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion </ITAG>The usefulness of the QC data is based upon two elements_precision andcoverage. Precision is achieved by sampling the annual allocated numberof cases and the weekly minimum number of cases. Coverage, however, isaffected by the degree to which sampling is not conducted for a portionof the population. This is especially important in the UI program whereseasonal aspects impact heavily on the data in a State. For example, usingRandom Audit (the forerunner of QC) data showed that dropping the datafor one quarter from the annual error rate calculation in one State wouldlower the annual error rate by approximately 11.70 percent for dollarsand 7.8 percent for weeks overpaid. This large change was due to the historicallyhigh error rates which were observed in that quarter.The Department recognizes that some situations may occur which preventthe SESAs from being able to conduct a sample for a given week; however,that should be relatively rare. If, for example, a SESA's mainframe wouldbe down for an entire week, it would be difficult or impossible to selecta sample. <ITAG tagnum="81">Option No. I: Proportional Assessment </ITAG>Under this option, the SESA would be required to reimburse the Departmentbased on its failure to investigate a sample for a week. The percentageassessment rate would be established at two percent of the annual grantfor QC administration and would be applied to each of the weeks in whichsamples are not drawn for investigation. The rationale for this assessmentis that two percent per week is a reasonably proportional amount of theentire grant. <ITAG tagnum="81">Option No. II: Flat Rate Assessment </ITAG>Under this option, the SESAs would be required to reimburse the Departmenta flat amount for each incidence of non sampling. An assessment would bemade for each incidence. This option would address the issue that resourcesprovided are not being utilized for the purpose provided. The proposedaction seeks to encourage full funding utilization. 3. Options for Failure To Meet the 90-Day Timelapse Criterion for CaseCompletion <ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion </ITAG>Prompt completion of investigations is important to ensure the integrityand accuracy of the information being collected by questioning claimantsand employers before the passage of time affects recollections. Associateddata entry is necessary for the Department to maintain a current data baseand to monitor SESA performance. Therefore the Department has establishedtime limits for the completion of all cases for the year. At present aminimum of 95 percent of cases assigned for the year must be completedwithin 90 days of the ending date of the calendar year. Due to questionsraised about the ability of the SESAs to achieve this level, the Departmenthas undertaken a study to determine if cases can be administratively controlledby a SESA to meet the 95% criterion. The results of the review may affectthe current criterion. The Department has acknowledged that there may be situations which arebeyond the control of the SESA and where good cause exists for not achievingthe required criterion. These situations will be reviewed on a case-by-casebasis by the Department. If an agency has managed cases so investigationsare promptly carried out they will be judged to fall within the criterion.<ITAG tagnum="81">Option No. I: Percentage Assessment Based on Allocation</ITAG>Under this option, the percentage of cases assigned that were completedwithin 90 days will be subtracted from the 90-day case completion standardand the result converted into the number of cases the resulting percentagerepresents of the annual allocation. States would be required to repayone FTE for each 100 cases not completed within 90 days. Based on the currentcase completion criteria, a State with an allocation of 1000 cases thatcompleted 75 percent of assigned cases within 90 days would have to repaytwo FTEs. Completion of 90 percent of the cases would require repaymentof .5 FTEs. There would be no repayment if the amount would be less than.5 FTEs.<ITAG tagnum="81">Option No. II: Percentage Assessment Based on Cases Investigated</ITAG>Under this option, the percentage of cases not completed within the casecompletion criteria would be computed using the actual number of casesassigned (sampled) rather than the annual allocation. Thus for a Statewhich only investigated 800 out of an allocated 1000 cases and completed75% within 90 days, the repayment would be 1.6 FTEs (95% minus 75% times800). Otherwise the assessment would be applied in the same manner.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Applicability to Data for Calendar Years 1988 and 1989</ITAG>The Department has no plans to apply administrative measures to the datafor Calendar Years 1988 or 1989. This notice is intended to solicit commentson possible administrative measures and related issues.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Additional Questions for Comment</ITAG>1. ExceptionsAre there any exceptions to the above options that should be allowed? Ifso what are they and why should they be allowed? What items are beyondthe control of the SESA and which fall within the control of the SESA?2. Administrative RelevanceAt what level(s) do the administrative measures suggested serve as a deterrenceto unacceptable levels of performance? Are the levels suggested in theoptions appropriate? If not, what are appropriate levels?3. Administrative ProcessHow should the Department proceed with the assessments? How can disagreementson factual information be best resolved? Should there be informal discussionsof the data to ensure accuracy before the assessment is recommended?4. Timeliness of InvestigationsAt what point does a late case equal a case not investigated? What is theerosion of case quality in relation to timelapse? What is the optimal definitionof a closed case? (Supervisor sign-off, investigation completed, other)5. Overlap of Administrative MeasuresShould the three areas identified for review be looked at independentlyor should they be combined? If they should be combined, how could thisbe accomplished?6. Other Administrative MeasuresAre there other measures which would be more appropriate for ensuring thatthe work is carried out in a manner to achieve the three objectives ofprecision, coverage, and timeliness? Should other objectives be substitutedfor the proposed items? If so, what are they and why are they more importantin ensuring that the data produced by the QC program can be used by managementto make valid conclusions?<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, on October 30, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Roberts T.
