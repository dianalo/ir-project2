<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-77-0015 </DOCNO><TEXT>A heat treated specimen of A 508 steel is investigated in both the unirradiatedand the neutron irradiated condition to determine the variation of thefracture toughness with temperature and specimen thickness. It is shownthat the fracture toughness is a decreasing function of both specimenthickness and temperature. A model developed previously by Beremin isused to interpret the results. Axisymmetric notched specimens are testedto determine the factors used in the statistical approach of cleavagefracture. It is confirmed that the Beremin model is able to account forthe large scatter in fracture toughness observed at a given temperatureon the unirradiated material. The specimen thickness effect is also reasonablywell interpreted by the model. The irradiation embrittlement can be explainedby assuming that the cleavage fracture resistance is not modified byirradiation and by taking into account only the variations of yield strengthwith irradiation and test temperature.</TEXT></DOC>
