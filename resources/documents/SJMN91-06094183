Itis known as the Delta and Pine Land Company, and consists of 38,000 acres ofrich soil, a factory and a mill. It was worth about $44 million back in 1968.In Texas, will she visit the wealthy Standard-Oil-of-New-Jersey heir, WilliamS. Farish? She visited Farish and his wife soon after the Falklands War attheir beautiful farm and estate in Kentucky. (This Texas millionaire and thequeen have horse breeding in common.)  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  WILL QUEEN VISIT HER U.S. HOLDINGS?  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Grapevine  </MEMO><TEXT>   BRIDAL SEARCH: Phoebe Cates (Mrs. Kevin Kline) was all set for the role ofthe blushing, virginal, newlywed-to-be in the Charles Shyer-Nancy Myers remakeof the MGM classic, &quot;Father of the Bride.&quot; (This team did &quot;Baby Boom&quot; and&quot;Private Benjamin.&quot;) Then Mother Nature stepped in. Cates became pregnant, buther agents thought she could play the part before this became evident. Theproducers didn't agree. So Cates is now out of the movie and her replacementis still being sought.;    From what I hear, blushing, virginal young thingsare hard to find in Hollywood. Reps for the film have even gone to England tolook, with no success. It seems most young actresses these days dress and lookso sophisticated, so polished, so &quot;tough&quot; if you will, that even the trulyvirginal among them seem to have been &quot;through the mill.&quot;;    According toSandollar producer Howard Rosenman, this remake will be a straight update ofthe 1950 original. Steve Martin and Diane Keaton are to play the SpencerTracy-Joan Bennett roles. Martin Short will be the supercilious &quot;weddingcoordinator.&quot; And whatever sweet young thing takes over from Cates will havethe burdensome knowledge that she is doing a role Elizabeth Taylor madefamous.;    Actually, in 1950, Taylor was a virginal young thing.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  From Liz Smith in New York  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910403  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  357  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday April 3, 199100094183,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
