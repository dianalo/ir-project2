The Department has determinedthat the practical utility of the letter of inquiry and the manufacturer'sadvice was minimal because andSection; 778.6 stated that ``notwithstandingthe advice provided by the manufacturer, the exporter remains responsiblefor filing an export license application for any export subject to andSection;778.3.'' Section 778.3 contains provisions on licensing requirements forexport of commodities and technical data with sensitive end-uses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This rule is effective June 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Vincent Greenwald, Office of Technologyand Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Telephone: (202)377-3856.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements</ITAG>1. This rule is consistent with Executive Orders 12291 and 12661.2. This rule removes a collection of information subject to the requirementsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This collection had been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget under control number 0694-0034. This action will reduce thepaperwork burden imposed on the public.3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. Section 13(b) of theEAA does not require that this rule be published in proposed form becausethis rule does not impose a new control. Further, no other law requiresthat a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public commentbe given for this rule.Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is noformal comment period, public comments on this regulation are welcome ona continuing basis.
