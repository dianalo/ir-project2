It's a high price for freedom,but's it's worth it.''   Thousands of civilians have been reported killed in Romaniasince the revolt against the last Soviet bloc dictator began Dec.15 in the western city of Timisoara. Hundreds more reportedly diedFriday in the uprising that sent Ceausescu fleeing from thepresidential palace.   In New York, demonstrators gathered in 12-degree cold across thestreet from the Romanian mission to the United Nations, the samespot where many of them have held nightly protests againstCeausescu since the upheaval in their homeland began.   The ralliers sipped champagne from plastic cups, waved red, blueand yellow Romanian flags _ minus the socialist symbol _ andchanted ``Victory, Victory.''   Speakers addressed the crowd in Romanian and English, presentingtheir demands for a completely new Romanian government. Sava calledon the U.S. government to send emergency medical and food aid toRomania.   ``Blood is especially needed _ we have heard that Ceausescubombed the blood bank and main hospital in Bucharest,'' she said.   Sava said the coalition Romania 21 would ask the U.S. governmentto seize the assets of the Romanian government in this country, toset up a congressional observation team to report on what happenedin Romania, and to bring Ceausescu to trial in the U.N. SecurityCouncil.   Some members of the crowd were able to reach friends andrelatives in Romania by telephone Friday.   ``My mother was crying _ all she could say was `I'm free',''said Horia Dugala, 26, who spoke with his mother in Brasov onFriday afternoon.   After hours of trying to contact his family by phone, RaduTuian, 32, reached a friend in Bucharest.   ``The most important thing was that he could speak freely forthe first time,'' Tuian said. ``After 45 years of darkness, theycame out into the light.''   Mircea Ionescu, a playwright who fled his country after hisworks were banned by the Ceausescu regime, said Romanians will beable to celebrate Christmas openly for the first time since the endof World War II,   ``But it's not Christmas _ it's bloody Christmas,'' saidIonescu, editor of the Romanian-language weekly Lumea Noastra.Still, he added, ``Now I'm proud of being Romanian.''   A demonstration celebrating the revolt also is planned Sunday atChicago's City Hall. An estimated 20,000 Romanian emigres live inthe Chicago area.   ``For us this is really the biggest day of our lives,'' saidRodica Perciali, director of the Romanian Folk Art Museum insuburban Evanston, Ill. But she too expressed remorse at the lossof life in the upheaval.   Mrs. Perciali said Romanians had felt ashamed as the rest ofEastern Europe enacted sweeping reforms of their communistgovernments.   ``We felt guilty and also powerless _ we almost lost hope to seeany change in Romania,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
