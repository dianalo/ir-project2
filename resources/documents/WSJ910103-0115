ThenI decided to take advantage of my ignorance of the book andwait to read it until after I saw the film so I wouldn't haveto succumb to the dreary ritual of comparing book to movie.   As it turned out this was a mistake. Without some kind ofoutside explanation, Mr. Bertolucci's film has the numbingeffect of a pretty travelogue; even the graphic sex scenesbecome a bore.</LP><TEXT>   The picture's opening sequences hold much promise, as Mr.Bertolucci introduces his main characters: Kit and Port, acouple who have spent their 10 years of marriage in thedesultory pursuit of happiness. They are traveling throughNorth Africa in the 1940s with a friend. He's on a lark; they-- especially Port -- figure the desert may hold the promisethey haven't yet found anywhere else, and they've been on theroad for years.   Port, played by John Malkovich with his characteristicbrooding intensity, is given to saying things like: &quot;My onlyplan is I have no plan.&quot; Kit (Debra Winger) responds to theirperpetual uneasiness with outbursts of temper or bywithdrawing into herself. Their friend Tunner (CampbellScott) has no obvious reason for being there except to createthe false hope that a love triangle might propel the movieforward.   For quite a while this long film's glossy beauty andstudied imagery has a mesmerizing effect. The alternatingcurrents of passion and alienation that pass between Kit andPort pose intriguing questions about what binds them. Theirmarriage clearly is outside the realm of the ordinary. Theyare always on the move so they are unburdened by the weightof everydayness -- and unrelieved by it as well. I also likethe fact that no matter where they go, no matter howprimitive the place, they carry with them a complete set ofluggage. They always dress well.   Mr. Bertolucci creates an aura of desperation and pain ashe shows this languorous duo wandering through the beauty andsqualor of desert towns. Even their lovemaking is mixed withpleasure and grief. They both realize that, for Port, everymoment of pleasure is dimmed by the idea of possiblepleasure, and possible excitement.   That theme is established early and then left to bake inthe desert for what starts to seem like an eternity. Port'swanderings lead him to the underbelly of wherever he is, andMr. Bertolucci takes great relish in painting a glossy visionof decadence. Both the strength and the weakness of &quot;The LastEmperor,&quot; for example, lay in the director's opulentportrayal of life among the Chinese royalty before thecommunists took over. The lush picture was all surface, hadno soul and barely any historical information. The story ofthe last emperor was told through indirection and nuance.   In &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; Mr. Bertolucci has carriedobliqueness to new heights. After awhile I found myselfthirsting for any information at all: Why don't Port and Kithave jobs? Why did Mr. Bertolucci choose to photograph DebraWinger's pubic hair and not her breasts? Does the directorregard sex between men and women as something perverse? (Theanswer to the last question must be yes, based on this filmand other Bertolucci works, especially the notorious sodomyscene in &quot;Last Tango in Paris.&quot;)   This movie loses its way entirely after Port meets hisdoom in the desert and Kit is left to join a caravan ofwandering desert people. Ms. Winger rides camels and allowsher new man to have sex with her in ways that don't meet theapproval of the village women. She then appears to have anervous breakdown, though even that isn't certain.   Mr. Bertolucci has also planted the writer Mr. Bowles intoa couple of scenes and given him some of his own lines tonarrate. Without having read the book I feel it is safe tosay that Mr. Bowles is a better writer than actor.   ---   A friend of mine said she forgave &quot;Come See the Paradise&quot;all its many faults because it's a film about a serioussubject at a time when so many films aren't about anything atall. I see her point but still can't shake the feeling thatthere's some thing seriously wrong with this glossy treatmentof the internment of American Japanese during World War II.   The British director Alan Parker has a canny sense of howto manipulate an audience and goes about it shamelessly. Youcan almost hear the calculations going through his mind whilehe was making this picture: How do you make this moviewithout offending anyone? His answer: Move the focus awayfrom the Japanese-American family actually enduring thesituation onto the charming American union organizer whomarries into the family. Let him carry the burden of guiltand then be absolved of it, because he is a good man afterall.   The movie isn't without power: How could one fail to bemoved at the sight of people who have lived somewhere alltheir lives being uprooted and shamed? And the glimpses ofJapanese-American life in the Little Tokyo section of LosAngeles give a hint of what the movie might have been.   ---   VIDEO TIP: Hollywood has dealt with the subject ofAmerican anti-Japanese prejudice with integrity. &quot;Hell toEternity&quot; was the story of a Californian, a World War IIhero, raised by Japanese-American parents, and hisconfrontation with the Japanese commander in the SouthPacific. Cross-cultural love was the subject of &quot;Sayonara,&quot;with Marlon Brando in the lead of James Mitchener's romantictragedy.</TEXT></DOC>
