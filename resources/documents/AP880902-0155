Stock and bond prices soared on the news, and analysts said thesoftening job market was just the ``cold shower'' than anoverheating economy needed. They predicted it will keep a lid oninflation and interest rates through the November elections.   The 0.2 percentage point rise from July's unemployment rate of5.4 percent was characterized by 5,000 layoffs in a manufacturingsector that had put 130,000 more workers on their assembly lines inthe previous three months in response to surging foreign demand forU.S. exports.   Last month, when factories reported adding 70,000 workers inJuly despite a slight increase in joblessness from a 14-year-low5.3 percent in June, the Federal Reserve Board applied the brakesto the economy, raising interest rates one-half percentage point.   ``This is a case where bad news is good news for an economy thatwas running hell-bent toward overheating and creating a veryworrisome inflationary environment,'' Allen Sinai of The BostonCo., a New York economic consulting firm, said of the August jobsreport. ``A little cold shower here was exactly what was needed.''   Richard Rahn, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's chief economist anda frequent critic of the Federal Reserve's monetary policies, saidthe unemployment figures show that the board ``has achieved itsgoal of slowing the economy.''   ``They now should reduce interest rates to avoid killing theexpansion,'' he said.   Most other analysts said they doubt that will happen, but theyagreed there is now little likelihood that interest rates will beraised again before the election.   A separate survey of business payrolls showed employers adding219,000 new jobs in August, compared with average monthly gains ofmore than 325,000 the previous three months.   Larry Chimerine of the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., economicconsulting firm, said the smaller payroll growth is consistent withan economy that is still expanding, but at a slower pace.   ``Clearly this will delay further tightening by the Fed,'' hesaid. ``They won't reverse what they did last month but they cannow afford to take a wait-and-see attitude. Clearly there is noevidence of a wage-price spiral. The inflation we are getting islimited primarily to commodity prices, imports and food, and atthis point does not threat to become much more widespread.''   ``This is another stroke of (President) Reagan's luck, aone-month cooling down when inflation pressures were buildingrapidly in a too steamy economy,'' Sinai said. ``There are two moreunemployment reports between now and the election, but if the ratestays between 5.4 percent and 5.8 percent, it can only be describedas a major accomplishment.''   Despite the increase in the unemployment rate, the LaborDepartment said a record 62.3 percent of the working-age population16 and over held jobs in August.   Campaigning in New Jersey, Republican presidential nomineeGeorge Bush called the rise in the jobless rate ``statisticallyalmost irrelevant. The total work force has been expanding ... it'svery encouraging,'' he said.   Susan Estrich, campaign manager for Democratic nominee MichaelDukakis, called the loss of 5,000 manufacturing jobs and thefailure of wages to rise above their $9.31 hourly average in July``blows to hopes for prosperity in the nation's heartland (and)easing the squeeze on working Americans.''   Wages have risen an average of only 3.1 percent over the past 12months, decreasing the buying power of workers by one-half percentafter taking inflation into account.   The Labor Department said most of the 226,000 increase injoblessness to 6,851,000 people in August occurred among adult men,whose unemployment rate rose 0.4 percentage points to 4.9 percent.   The unemployment rate also rose among teen-agers, from 15.2percent to 15.8 percent, but fell from 5.1 percent to 4.8 percentfor women and from 11.4 percent to 11.3 percent among blacks.   Small employment gains in printing and publishing andexport-related industries such as machinery and electricalequipment were more than offset by 9,000 job losses in textile andapparel plants and smaller declines in several other manufacturingindustries.   On the services side of the economy, large monthly increases inretail trade hiring _ 80,000 in July alone _ slowed to just 23,000new jobs last month, virtually all of them in grocery stores.   Other recent high-growth job areas also slackened. Businessservices such as temporary help firms added just 16,000 newworkers, compared with average monthly increases of 30,000 in Juneand July.   New employment in health services, which the government predictswill be the largest area of job growth in the 1990s as the BabyBoom population ages, slowed to 22,000 in August from its30,000-a-month average in the past year.   Janet L. Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics, said oneencouraging sign was that the number of people working part-timebecause they could not find full-time jobs ``returned to the bottomof the 5.2 million-to-5.6 million range within which it has beenfluctuating for more than a year.''   Other data in the report, however, suggested the economy mightbe slowing. The average work week declined by 20 minutes to 34.6hours and manufacturing overtime fell by 0.1 hours to 3.8 hours aweek on average.   A separate calculation that includes the 1.7 million active-dutymilitary personnel stationed in the United States showed a joblessrate of 5.5 percent last month, up from 5.4 percent in July.</TEXT></DOC>
