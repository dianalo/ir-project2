Dropletsranging from 50 to 80 {mu}m in radius with coal loadings from 20 to 60percent by mass were pulse heated for 8 ms using a Nd:YAG laser (1.06{mu}m wavelength). Radiation intensities were varied from 250 to 350W/cm/sup 2/. Time resolved records of the changes in droplet mass andsize were obtained before and after the radiation pulse using a uniqueimaging system. Evaporation rates in the ambient gas prior to the heatingpulse were 0.367 times the theoretical rate for a pure water droplet.Evaporation rates for the hot droplets immediately after the heatingpulse were about 0.1 times the value anticipated for pure water. A theoreticalmodel was developed to predict droplet evaporation rates. The model considersthe inhibition of evaporation by a surface monolayer as well as effectsof other important parameters. The presence of the surfactant in thefuel droplet is shown to have a profound influence on the evaporationof water from a slurry droplet.</TEXT></DOC>
