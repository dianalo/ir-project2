Mr. Baker's statement, in testimony to the Joint Economic Committee, came in response to a question from Sen. William Proxmire (D., Wis.) about whether the secretary had reprimanded the Treasury's top economist for attempting to influence monetary policy recently in a letter to Fed officials. The senator was harshly critical of the letter.    Mr. Baker said he hadn't cleared the letter in advance and has since suggested to the economist that its timing, shortly before an important policy-setting meeting, was inappropriate. He said, however, that he didn't reprimand the official, Assistant Treasury Secretary Michael Darby, who &quot;was setting forth some academic views.&quot;    Moreover, he emphasized the Fed shouldn't be totally sheltered from advice and criticism. He said, &quot;The administration has a right and a responsibility to advise the Federal Reserve on all elements of economic policy,&quot; just as the administration gets advice from the Fed.    He said he consults frequently with Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan -- as he did with former Chairman Paul Volcker -- on a variety of topics including the global debt situation, exchange rates and fiscal and monetary policy. &quot;The Fed is independent and ought to remain independent,&quot; he said, &quot;but it's independent within this government and not independent of this government.&quot;    Mr. Baker said the administration and the Fed should avoid public criticism of each other's policies, however. He described their relationship as a &quot;two-way street,&quot; explaining that there wouldn't be any &quot;Fed bashing&quot; by the Treasury as long as the Fed refrained from &quot;bashing&quot; the administration's fiscal policy. But if the Fed criticized fiscal policy in public, then the Treasury would have a right to voice any complaints it has with monetary policy, he said.    Still, he said he is &quot;in fundamental agreement&quot; with the Fed's policies and has been since before Mr. Greenspan became chairman. </TEXT></DOC>
