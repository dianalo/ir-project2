While details of the agreement will have to be worked outover the next several months, diplomats said the pact signalsa major shift in North Korea's policy of isolation fromfree-market economies. North Korea's economy is in serioustrouble, with severe food and fuel shortages. An agreementwith South Korea may help to encourage badly needed foreigninvestment, an Asian diplomat said.</LP><TEXT>   Although the agreement promises to lessen tensions on theKorean peninsula, it doesn't deal with the contentious issueof North Korea's apparent program to develop nuclear weapons.South Korea and its allies believe that North Korea isconducting research that will enable it to build a nuclearbomb within two years. North Korea has resisted internationalpressure to allow inspection of its facilities.   At a banquet Thursday evening, elated South Korean PrimeMinister Chung Wonshik, embracing his northern counterpart,Yon Hyong-muk, called the agreement &quot;a New Year's present forthe Korean people.&quot; It is the first agreement since the twosides began meeting in September of 1990 and is the broadestagreement the two countries have ever made with each other.   Should the agreement increase trade and allow direct phoneand postal communication, it will be a major step toward thereunification of the two countries, South Korean officialssaid. But North Korea is expected to be hesitant to allow toomuch direct contact between the people of the two countriesbecause they are said to fear that will destabilize theirhard-line Communist regime.   The agreement pledges nonaggression between the twocountries, which have been at the brink of war since thearmistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. North Korea hasmore than one million soldiers and South Korea has about650,000 soldiers. The U.S. also has 39,000 troops in SouthKorea, an arrangement that North Korea is still trying to seeended.   South Korean President Roh Tae Woo is expected to ask fora summit meeting with Kim Il Sung, the leader of North Korea.   South Korean officials say the pact calls for connectingland, sea and air transportation routes and establishment ofan economic cooperation committee within six months. Theagreement also says the two sides shall respect each other'spolitical systems, not interfere in internal affairs, and notslander or sabotage each other.   A telephone hotline between the two sides' militaries willbe established. Both sides also will agree to set up liaisonoffices at the border village of Panmunjom inside theso-called Demilitarized Zone. It would help reunite 10million families separated by the division of the peninsulaand the Korean War.   North Korea will also agree to negotiate with South Koreaon a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended theKorean War. South Korea was not a signatory of that armisticeand North Korea had insisted in the past that a peace treatybe signed between it and the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
