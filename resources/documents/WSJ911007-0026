In a unanimous decision, a panel of three judges on theFourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Baltimore ruled that theFirst Amendment's right to associate and federal labor lawsdon't give members of the Transportation CommunicationsInternational Union the right to contribute only for costsrelated to collective-bargaining activities. The ruling onlyapplies to unions in the Fourth Circuit's jurisdiction, whichcovers the Southeast. One union member, Kathryn A. Kidwell,and three nonmembers had sued the union in a dispute over itsrules.</LP><TEXT>   Railroad employees already had the right to declinemembership but accept some union benefits in return forpartial payment of union dues. The appeals court ruling meansthat full members can't decide not to pay full dues justbecause they disagree with how union money is spent.   In the decision, the Fourth Circuit's first on the issue,Judge Francis D. Murnaghan noted that the U.S. Supreme Courthas never addressed the question of whether such membershiprules are lawful.   The appeals court overturned a lower court ruling that theunion had to permit objecting members to withhold portions oftheir dues. The union appealed, arguing that its rules aren'tcoercive because employees can choose to be full-dues-payingmembers or partial-dues-paying nonmembers with some unionbenefits.   Judge Murnaghan wrote in the decision last week that theunion's position was valid under the federal Railway LaborAct, which empowers unions to represent employees, and theFirst Amendment because after &quot;choosing voluntarily to jointhe union, a member must meet her or his share of theexpenses.&quot;   The union's lawyer could not be reached for comment.   Milton Leroy Chappell, the plaintiffs' lawyer from theNational Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, said he willadvise his clients to ask that the entire Fourth Circuitreview the case. Mr. Chappell said the appellate court hasgiven his clients a &quot;Hobson's choice&quot; -- the freedom tochoose between undesirable alternatives.   Mr. Chappell said the solution is to give union membersthe right to vote on what candidates or political positionsthey want their union to endorse or allow nonmembers to voteon collective-bargaining issues.   ---   NEW SUITS MAY BE FILED against partners of defunctaccounting firm.   The threat of new litigation continues to hang over someformer partners and principals of Laventhol andamp; Horwath, thePhiladelphia accounting firm that sought bankruptcy-courtprotection late last year.   Laventhol, once the seventh largest U.S. accounting firm,collapsed after it became the target of several suitsstemming from its auditing and consulting work.   Despite the exhortations of a federal bankruptcy judge inNew York, about 100 of 600 Laventhol former partners andsenior principals have failed to provide the financial dataand tax returns that Laventhol needs to draft areorganization plan, says Kevin Anderson, Laventhol's generalcounsel. Laventhol must settle with 7,700 creditors,including suppliers, landlords, employees, clients and banks.   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Cornelius Blackshear sayscourt protection against suits by outside creditors willexpire Wednesday if those accountants and consultants don'tsupply the data.   In addition, the former partners and principals could besued by Laventhol to recoup funds to pay off $2 billion inclaims by current litigants and creditors, says Mr. Anderson.Laventhol owes $800 million to just two creditor banks, ChaseManhattan Corp.'s Chase Manhattan Bank unit and FirstFidelity Bancorp.'s Fidelity Bank unit.   Jack Stern, an associate with Shearman andamp; Sterling, the NewYork law firm for the creditors' committee, says theWednesday deadline will probably be extended by the judge toOct. 30 to give the former partners and principals more timeto supply the data.   &quot;We need the time to prevent a blizzard of lawsuits by thecreditors against individual partners and principals,&quot; saidMr. Stern. Resolution of the creditors' claims could drag onfor some time, he adds.   Mr. Anderson said the debtor's plan to resolve creditorclaims against Laventhol might be drafted by the start of1992, with a settlement with the creditors reached soonafterward.   ---   STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL is sued for revoking job offer togay lawyer.   Robin Shahar, 28 years old, sued Michael J. Bowers,Georgia's attorney general, in U.S. District Court in AtlantaThursday. She contends she unfairly lost a job in Mr.Bowers's office after she disclosed plans to marry anotherwoman in a religious service.   Ms. Shahar had worked for Mr. Bowers as a summer intern in1990. This spring, after graduating from Emory Law School inAtlanta, she accepted an offer to work in his office as astaff attorney. When filling out personnel records, she notedthat she was engaged to another woman. Mr. Bowers withdrewthe job offer on July 10, the suit says, and Ms. Shaharshortly thereafter proceeded with the wedding, a privateceremony performed by a rabbi.   Although Georgia law doesn't recognize gay marriages, Ms.Shahar &quot;has never represented this to be a legal, civilmarriage,&quot; said Ruth Harlow, an attorney with the AmericanCivil Liberties Union's national Lesbian and Gay RightsProject who is handling the case. &quot;It was simply a religiousceremony. It's clearly protected by the First Amendment,&quot; Ms.Harlow said.   Still, Mr. Bowers said Friday that hiring Ms. Shahar wouldbe giving tacit recognition to a homosexual union, and&quot;there's only one kind of marriage recognized in Georgia.&quot;   &quot;I felt I was immune to discrimination,&quot; said Ms. Shahar,who is demanding the job in her suit. &quot;I was surprised that Iwasn't.&quot;   ---   HAITI'S LAWYERS will continue to seek Duvalier's assets inthe U.S.   The attorneys will pursue the assets on behalf of thegovernment of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, which wasoverthrown last week, even if Mr. Aristide remains in exilein the U.S.   Ira J. Kurzban, who represents the republic of Haiti, saidMr. Aristide met with his U.S. lawyers Thursday and told themto continue litigating for control of assets held by thefamily of former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier.   Since Mr. Duvalier was deposed in 1986, Haitian leadershave been attempting to recover more than $50 million he isbelieved to have embezzled. Although most of the money isthought to be in Swiss bank accounts, millions of dollars inassets, including two Trump Tower apartments, may becontrolled by the family in the U.S.   One suit in a federal court in Miami resulted in an$800,000 settlement this summer, according to Mr. Kurzban ofthe Miami law firm Kurzban Kurzban andamp; Weinger. The firsthearing in another suit involving a $200,000 Bank of New Yorkaccount allegedly controlled by Michele Duvalier, Mr.Duvalier's wife, was held Friday in federal court inManhattan. Bank of New York is a unit of Bank of New York Co.   On Friday, President Bush froze all Haitian assets in theU.S. But Mr. Kurzban expects Mr. Aristide's government to begranted a license to control those assets.   ---   NOTED: The Salt Lake City law firm Van Cott, Bagley,Cornwall andamp; McCarthy has opened a branch in Reno, Nev., whichwill operate under the name Jeppson andamp; Lee.
