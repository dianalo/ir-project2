Scope and Application</ITAG>1.1 This method is used to determine the oil content and the identity andconcentration of diesel oil in drilling fluid (mud) samples. It is applicableto all mud types and may also be used to determine the oil content anddiesel oil in drill cuttings.1.2 This method may be used for compliance monitoring purposes as partof the ``Effluent Limitations Guidelines and New Source Performance Standardsfor the Offshore Subcategory of the Oil and Gas Extraction Point SourceCategory''.1.3 When this method is used to analyze samples for which there is no referencediesel oil, diesel oil identification should be supported by at least oneadditional qualitative technique. Method 1625 provides gas chromatograph/massspectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantiativeconfirmation of the presence of the components of diesel oil (References1-2).1.4 The detection limit of this method is usually dependent upon the presenceof other oils in the sample. Excluding interferences, estimated limitsof 200 mg/kg of oil content and 100 mg/kg of diesel oil can be obtained.1.5 Any modification of this method beyond those expressly permitted shallbe considered a major modification subject to application and approvalof alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.1.6 The gas chromatography portions of this method are restricted to useby or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of gas chromatographyand in the interpretation of gas chromatograms. Each laboratory that usesthis method must generate acceptable results using the procedures describedin Sections 8.2 and 12 of this method.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Summary of Method</ITAG>2.1 A weighed amount of drilling mud is distilled using a retort apparatus.The distillate is extracted with methylene chloride and the extract isdried by passage through sodium sulfate. The extract is evaporated to dryness,and the total amount of oil in the sample is determined gravimetrically.The oil is redissolved in methylene chloride, an internal standard is added,and an aliquot is injected into a gas chromatograph (GC). The componentsof the oil are separated by the GC and detected using a flame ionizationdetector (FID).2.2 Identification of diesel oil (qualitative analysis) is performed bycomparing the pattern of GC peaks (rentention times and intensities) fromthe sample extract with the patter of GC peaks from a reference dieseloil sample. Identification of diesel oil is established when the referencediesel and sample patterns agree per the criteria in this method.2.3 Quantitative analysis of diesel oil is performed using an internalstandard technique.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Contamination and Interferences </ITAG>3.1 Solvents, reagents, glassware and other sample processing hardwaremay yield artifacts and/or elevated baselines causing misinterpretationof chromatograms. All materials shall be demonstrated to be free from interferencesunder the conditions of the analysis by running method blanks initiallyand with each set of samples. Specific selection of reagents and purificationof solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required. Glasswareand, where possible, reagents are cleaned by solvent rinse or baking at450 degrees C for one hour minimum.3.2 There is no standard diesel oil. Oil components, as seen by GC-FID,will differ depending upon the oil source, the production date, productionprocess, and the producer. In addition, there are three basic types ofdiesel oils: ASTM Designations No. 1-D, No. 2-D, and No. 4-D. The No. 2-Dis the most common ``diesel oil''; however, No. 2-D is sometimes blendedwith No. 1-D which has a lower boiling range. For rigorous identificationand quantification of diesel oil in a drilling fluid sample by GC-FID,the chromatographic pattern from the diesel oil should be matched withthe chromatographic pattern from a reference standard of the same dieseloil suspencted to be in the sample.3.3 To aid in the identification of interferences, the chromatographicpattern from a reference sample of drilling fluid prior to use is comparedto the chromatographic pattern of the drilling fluid after use. An interferenceis present when the pattern of the background oil does not match, but contributessubstantially to, the pattern of the diesel oil in the sample.3.4 Mineral oils are often added to drilling fluids for lubricity. Theseoils, when examined by GC-FID, contain some components common to dieseloil but have chromatographic patterns that are distinctly different fromdiesel oil. The analyst must first determine if the sample chromatogramshows the presence of diesel, mineral, or a combination of both beforereliable quantification can be performed. This method permits selectionof GC peaks unique to diesel oil for determination of diesel oil in thepresence of mineral oil.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Safety</ITAG>4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this methodhas not been defined. Therefore, each chemical compound should be treatedas a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicalsmust be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available.The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness fileof OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specifiedin this method. A reference file of materials handling data sheets shouldalso be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis.Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have beenidentified (References 3-5) for the information of the analyst.4.2 Methylene chloride has been classified as a known health hazard. Allsteps in this method which involve exposure to this compound shall be performedin an OSHA approved fume hood.<ITAG tagnum="81">5.

Calibration</ITAG>7.1 Establish gas chromatographic operating conditions given in Table 2.Verify that the GC meets the performance criteria (Section 12) and theestimated detection limit (Section 1.4). The gas chromatographic systemis calibrated using the internal standard technique.7.2 Internal standard calibration procedure_1,3,5-Trichlorobenzene (TCB)has been shown to be free of interferences from the diesel oils testedin the development of this method. However, if an interference is knownor suspected, the analyst must choose an alternative internal standardthat is free from interferences.7.2.1 Inject 1 uL of each reference oil standard containing the internalstandard (Table 1 and Section 6.5.2) into the GC-FID. The TCB will eluteapproximately 8.5 minutes after injection. For the GC-FID used in the developmentof this method, the TCB internal standard peak was 30 to 50 percent offull scale at an attenuator setting of 8E-11 amp.7.2.2 Individual response factors7.2.2.1 Tabulate the peak area responses against concentration for eachof the 10 largest peaks in the chromatogram (excluding the solvent peak,the internal standard peak, and any peaks that elute prior to the internalstandard peak). (See Section 13 for guidance on peak selection.) Calculateresponse factors (RF) for each peak using the following equation:Equation 1:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,5,10</C> <H1>RF=</H1><H1>(A</H1><T2>s</T2>) (C<T2>is</T2>)<H2>(A</H2><T2>is</T2>) (C<T2>s</T2>)<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">A<T2>s</T2>=Area of the peak to be measured.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">A<T2>is</T2>=Area of the internal standard peak.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">C<T2>s</T2>=Concentration of the peak to be measured (mg/kg).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">C<T2>is</T2>=Concentration of the internal standard (mg/kg).</ITAG>7.2.2.2 If the RF is constant (andless;15% CV) over the calibration range(Table 1), the RF can be assumed to be invariant and the average RF canbe used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to plota calibration curve of response rations, A<T2>s</T2>/A<T2>is</T2>, vs RF.7.2.2.3 Calibration verification_the average RF or a point on the calibrationcurve shall be verified on each working day by the measurement of one ormore calibration standards. If the RF for any peak varies from the RF obtainedin the calibration by more than andplusmin;15 percent, the test shall berepeated using a fresh calibration standard. Alternatively, a new calibrationcurve shall be prepared.7.2.3 Combined response factor_to reduce the error associated with themeasurement of a single peak, a combined response factor is used for computationof the diesel oil concentration. This combined response factor is the sumof the individual response factors as given in equations 2 or 3:Equation 2:RF combined=RF(1) + RF(2) . . . +RF(n)Equation 3:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,14,34</C> <H1>[A</H1><T2>s(1)</T2>+A<T2>s(2)</T2> . . . +A<T2>s(n)</T2>] (C<T2>is</T2>)<H1>RF combined=</H1><H2>(A</H2><T2>is</T2>)(C<T2>s</T2>)<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">n is the number of individual peaks</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">A<T2>s(i)</T2> . . .

Quality Assurance/Quality Control</ITAG>8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formalquality assurance program (Reference 7). The minimum requirements of thisprogram consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability, anongoing analysis of standards and blanks as a test of continued performance,analyses of spiked samples to assess accuracy, and analysis of duplicatesto assess precision. Laboratory performance is compared to establishedperformance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performancecharacteristics of the method.8.1.1 The analyst shall make an initial demonstration of the ability togenerate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This abilityis established as described in Section 8.2.8.1.2 The analyst is permitted to modify this method to improve separationsor lower the costs of measurements, provided all performance requirementsare met. Each time a modification is made to the method, the analyst isrequired to achieve the estimated detection limit (Section 1.4) and torepeat the procedure in Section 8.2 to demonstrate method performance.8.1.3 Analyses of spiked samples are required to demonstrate method accuracy.The procedure and QC criteria for spiking are described in Section 8.3.8.1.4 Analyses of duplicate samples are required to demonstrate methodprecision. The procedure and QC criteria for duplicates are described inandSection; 8.4.8.1.5 Analyses of blanks are required to demonstrate freedom from contamination.The procedures and criteria for analysis of a blank are described in Section8.5.8.1.6 The laboratory shall, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through calibrationverification and the analysis of the QC standard (Section 6.6) that theanalysis system is in control. These procedures are described in Section12.8.1.7 The laboratory shall maintain records to define the quality of datathat is generated. Development of accuracy statements is described in Sections8.3.4 and 12.5.8.2 Initial precision and accuracy_to establish the ability to generateacceptable precision and accuracy, the analyst shall perform the followingoperations:8.2.1 Retort, extract, concentrate, and analyze four samples of the QCstandard (Sections 6.6 and 10.1.3) according to the procedure beginningin Section 10.8.2.2 Using results of the set of four analyses, compute the average recovery(X) in mg/kg and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in mg/kg foreach sample by the internal standard method (Sections 7.2 and 14.2).8.2.3 For each compound, compare s and X with the corresponding limitsfor initial precision and accuracy in Table 4. If s and X meet the acceptancecriteria, system performance is acceptable and analysis of samples maybegin. If, however, s exceeds the precision limit or X falls outside therange for accuracy, system performance is unacceptable. In this event,review this method and the manufacturer's instructions, correct the problem,and repeat the test.8.3 Method accuracy_the laboratory shall spike a minimum of 20 percent(one sample in each set of five samples) of all drilling fluid samples.This sample shall be spiked with the diesel oil that was added to the drillingfluid. If a reference standard of diesel oil that was added to the drillingfluid is not available, No. 2 diesel oil shall be used for this spike.If doubt of the identity and concentration of diesel oil in any of theremaining 80 percent of the samples exists, that sample shall be spikedto confirm the identity and establish the diesel oil concentration.8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample shall be determinedas follows:8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of the oil inthe sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, thespike shall be at that limit or at one to five times higher than the backgroundconcentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration is larger.8.3.1.2 If the concentration of the oil in a sample is not being checkedagainst a limit, the spike shall be at the concentration of the QC standard(Section 6.6) or at one to five times higher than the background concentration,whichever concentration is larger.8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration(B) of oil content and of diesel oil. If necessary, prepare a standardsolution appropriate to produce a level in the sample at the regulatoryconcentration limit or at one to five times the background concentration(per Section 8.3.1). Spike a second sample aliquot with the standard solutionand analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of eachanalyte. Calculate the percent recovery (P) of oil content and of dieseloil:P=100(A-B)/Twhere T is the true value of the spike.8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery for oil content and for diesel oil withthe corresponding QC acceptance criteria in Table 4. If the results ofthe spike fail the acceptance criteria, and the recovery of QC standardin the ongoing precision and recovery test (Sections 10.1.3 and 12.5) iswithin the acceptance criteria in Table 4, and interference may be present(see Sections 3 and 15 for identification of interferences). In this case,the result may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes. If,however, the results of both the spike and the ongoing precision and recoverytest fail the acceptance criteria, the analytical system is judged to beout of control and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected,and the sample set reanalyzed.8.3.4 As part of the QA program for the laboratory, method accuracy forsamples shall be assessed and records shall be maintained. After the analysisof five spiked samples in which the recovery passes the test in Section8.3, compute the average percent recovery (P) and the standard deviationof the percent recovery (s<T2>p</T2>). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery intervalfrom P^2s<T2>p</T2> to P+2s<T2>p</T2>. For example, if P=90% and s<T2>p</T2>=10% for five analyses of diesel oil, the accuracy interval isexpressed as 70 to 110%. Update the accuracy assessment on a regular basis(<T3>e.g.,</T3> after each 5 to 10 new accuracy measurements).8.4 The laboratory shall analyze duplicate samples for each drilling fluidtype at a minimum of 20 percent (one sample for each five sample set).A duplicate sample shall consist of a well-mixed, representative aliquotof the sample.8.4.1 Analyze one sample in the set in duplicate per the procedure beginningin Section 10.8.4.2 Compute the relative percent difference (RPD) between the two resultsper the following equation:Equation 4: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,7,10,5</C> <H1>RPD=</H1><H1>(D1^D2)</H1><H2>(D1+D2)/2</H2><H1>andmultiply;100</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>where:D1=concentration of diesel in the sampleD2=concentration of diesel oil in the second (duplicate) sample8.4.3 The relative percent difference for duplicates shall meet the acceptancecriteria in Table 5. If the criteria are not met, the analytical systemshall be judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediatelyidentified and corrected, and the sample set reanalyzed.8.5 Blanks_reagent water blanks are analyzed to demonstrate freedom fromcontamination.8.5.1 Extract and concentrate a reagent water blank initially and witheach sample set (samples started through the analysis on the same day,to a maximum of 5 samples). Analyze the blank immediately after analysisof the QC standard (Section 6.6) to demonstrate freedom from contamination.8.5.2 If any of the components of diesel oil or any potentially interferingcompound is detected in a blank, analysis of samples is halted until thesource of contamination is eliminated and a blank shows no evidence ofcontamination.8.6 Comparison of gravimetric and diesel oil measurements.8.6.1 Compare the concentration of the oil content (Section 14.1.2) determinedgravimetrically with the diesel oil concentration determined by GCFID (Section14.2.2). If the diesel oil concentration exceeds the gravimetric oil concentration,the analysis has been performed improperly. Correct the error or repeatthe sample analysis beginning with Section 10.8.7 The specifications contained in this method can be met if the apparatusused is calibrated properly, then maintained in a calibrated state. Thestandards used for initial (Section 8.2) and ongoing (Section 12.5) precisionand recovery should be identical, so that the most precise results willbe obtained. The GC instrument will provide the most reproducible resultsif dedicated to the settings and conditions required for the analyses ofthe analyte given in this method.8.8 Depending on specific program requirements, field replicates and fieldspikes of diesel oil into samples may be required to assess the precisionand accuracy of the sampling and sample transporting techniques.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling</ITAG>9.1 Collect drilling fluid samples in wide-mouth glass containers followingconventional sampling practices (Reference 8).9.2 Samples must be representative of the entire bulk drilling fluid. Insome instances, composite samples may be required.9.3 Maintain samples at 0 to 4 degrees C from the time of collection untilextraction.9.4 Sample and extract holding times for this method have not yet beenestablished. However, based on tests of wastewater for the analytes determinedin this method, samples shall be extracted within seven days of collectionand extracts shall be analyzed within 40 days of extraction.9.5 As a precaution against analyte and solvent loss or degradation, sampleextracts are stored in glass bottles with Teflon lined caps, in the dark,at ^20 to ^10 degrees C.<ITAG tagnum="81">10. Sample Extraction and Concentration  </ITAG>10.1 Retort  10.1.1 Tare the retort sample cup and cap to the nearest 0.1 g. Transfera well homogenized and representative portion of the drilling fluid tobe tested into the sample cup. Do not fill the retort cup to the top sothat excess sample must be wiped off. Place the cap on the cup and reweigh.Record the weight of the sample to the nearest 0.1 g. Note: On agitation,most drilling fluids entrain air as small bubbles. The extent of air entrainmentis uncertain and is difficult to detect when the mud is poured into theretort cup. By weighing the drilling fluid, the quantitative detectionof diesel oil is improved. In addition, by using a gravimetric measurementof the amount of sample, the retort cup does not need to be completelyfilled. This procedure avoids the error that occurs when the cup is filledand the oil rises to the surface of the sample and must be wiped off (asoccurs if the manufacturer's instructions are followed), thus resultingin a loss of oil.  10.1.2 Follow the manufacturer's instructions for retort of the drillingfluid. Substitute 6 g of loosely packed glass wool for the steel wool inthe manufacturer's instructions and distill the sample into a glass receiver.The presence of solids in the distillate require that the distillationbe rerun starting with a new portion of sample. Placing more glass woolin the retort expansion chamber, per the manufacturer's instructions, willhelp prevent the solids from being carried over in the distillation.  10.1.3 QC standard_used for tests of initial (section 8.2) and ongoing(section 12.5) precision and accuracy. For the initial set of four samples(section 8.2) and for each set of samples started through the retort processon the same working day (to a maximum of five), prepare a QC sample asfollows:  10.1.3.1 Place the QC standard (section 6.y) in the retort cup beginningin section 10.1.  10.1.3.2 Analyze the QC standard beginning with section 10.1.2 then proceedingto section 10.2.  10.1.4 Blank_For the initial set of four samples (section 8.2) and foreach set of samples started through the retort process on the same workingday (to a maximum of five), prepare a blank as follows:  10.1.4.1 Place 10 mL of reagent water in a clean, tared, retort cup andweigh to the nearest mg. Record the weight of the reagent water.  10.1.4.2 Analyze the blank beginning with section 10.1.2 then proceedingto section 10.2.  10.2 Extraction and drying.  10.2.1 After the distillation is complete, pour the retort distillate intoa 60 mL separatory funnel. Quantitatively rinse the inner surfaces of theretort stem and condenser with methylene chloride into the separatory funnel.Rinse the receiver with two full receiver volumes of methylene chlorideand add to the separatory funnel.  10.2.2 Stopper and shake the funnel for one minute, with periodic ventingto prevent a buildup of gas pressure. Allow the layers to separate. Preparea glass filtering funnel by plugging the bottom with a piece of glass wooland pouring in 1 to 2 inches of anhydrous sodium sulfate. Alternatively,a drying column may be used. Wet the funnel or column with a small portionof methylene chloride and allow the methylene chloride to drain to a wastecontainer.10.2.3 Place the glass filtering funnel or drying column into the top ofa Kuderna-Danish (K-D) flask equipped with a preweighed 10 mL receivingflask. Add a preweighed boiling chip to the receiving flask. Drain themethylene chloride (lower) layer into the glass filtering funnel or dryingcolumn, and collect the extract in the K-D flask.  10.2.4 Repeat the methylene chloride extraction twice more, rinsing theretort with two thorough washings each time and draining each methylenechloride extract through the funnel or drying column into the K-D flask.<ITAG tagnum="81">10.3 Concentration  </ITAG>10.3.1 Place a Snyder column on the K-D flask. Prewet the Snyder columnby adding about one mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K/Dapparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 degrees C) so that the concentratortube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower roundedsurface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical positionand the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in15 to 20 minutes. At the proper rate of distillation, the balls of thecolumn will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensedsolvent. Concentrate the sample until it is free of methylene chloride.Remove the K-D apparatus from the hot water bath and allow to cool.  10.3.2 Weigh and record the final weight of the receiving flask.   10.3.3 Dissolve the oil in methylene chloride and adjust the final volumeto 1.0 mL. If the extract did not concentrate to a final volume of 1.0mL or less, adjust the final volume to 10.0 mL.<ITAG tagnum="81">11.

Captightly and mix thoroughly.  11.3 Inject 1 uL of the sample extract or reference standard into the GCusing the conditions in Table 2.  11.4 Begin data collection and the temperature program at the time of injection.   11.5 If the area of any peak exceeds the calibration range of the system,make a 10-fold dilution of the extract (Section 10.3.3), mix a 100 uL aliquotof this dilute extract with 90 uL of the internal standard solution (Section6.4), and reanalyze.<ITAG tagnum="81">12. System and Laboratory Performance  </ITAG>12.1 At the beginning of each working day during which analyses are performed,GC calibration is verified. For these tests, analysis of the 300 mg/mLcalibration standard (Table 1) shall be used to verify all performancecriteria. Adjustment and/or recalibration (per Section 7) shall be performeduntil all performance criteria are met. Only after all performance criteriaare met may the QC standard, blank, and samples be analyzed.  12.2 Retention times  12.2.1 Retention time of the internal standard_the absolute retention timeof the TCB internal standard shall be within the range of 7.96 to 8.08minutes.12.2.2 Relative retention times of the n-alkanes_the retention times ofthe n-alkanes relative to the TCB internal standard shall be within thelimits given in Table 4.12.3 Calibration verification12.3.1 Compute the response factor for each peak by the internal standardtechnique (Section 7.2).12.3.2 For each peak, compare the response factor with the response factorfrom the initial calibration (Section 7.2.2). If all response factors arewithin andplusmin;15 percent of their respective values in the initial calibration,system calibration has been verified. If not, prepare a fresh calibrationstandard and repeat the test (Section 12.1), or recalibrate (Section 7).12.4 Multiple GC peaks_each n-alkane shall give a single, distinct GC peak.12.5 Ongoing precision and accuracy12.5.1 Compute the oil content concentration and the concentration of dieseloil in the QC standard in each sample set (Section 10.1.3) prior to analysisof any sample in the set.12.5.2 Compare the concentration with the QC limit in Table 4. If the concentrationsof oil content and of diesel oil in the QC standard meet the acceptancecriteria, system performance is acceptable and analysis of samples mayproceed. If, however, the concentrations do not meet the acceptance criteria,system performance is unacceptable. In this event, correct the problem,reprocess the sample set (Section 10), and repeat the ongoing precisionand accuracy test (Sections 10.1.3 and 12.5).12.5.3 Add results that pass the specifications in Section 12.5.2 to initialand previous ongoing data. Update QC charts to form a graphic representationof continued laboratory performance. Develop statements of laboratory accuracyfor oil content and diesel oil in drilling fluids by calculating the averagepercent recovery (R) and the standard deviation of percent recovery (s<T2>r</T2>). Express the accuracy statement as a recovery interval fromR^2s<T2>r</T2> to R+2 s<T2>r</T2>. For example, if R=95 percent and s<T2>r</T2>=5 percent, the accuracy is 85 to 105 percent.13. Qualitative DeterminationIf less than 10 GC peaks (excluding the solvent peak, the internal standardpeak, and any peaks that elute prior to the TCB internal standard peak)are present in the analysis of the sample, and the QC tests (Sections 8and 12) for the sample set are acceptable, diesel oil is not present inthe sample. If 10 or more GC peaks are present in the analysis of the sample,diesel oil is identified by comparing the relative retention times andrelative areas of peaks from the analysis of the concentrated extract ofa mud sample to the relative retention times and relative areas of peaksfrom the reference standard.13.1 Relative retention times_the n-alkane peaks (Table 3) shall be withinthe limits in Table 3. If the relative retention times are not within theselimits, repeat the analysis of the reference diesel oil and the analysisof concentrated extract of the mud sample and compare the relative retentiontimes. If the relative retention times of the n-alkane peaks do not agree,the retention times of the 10 largest components that agree within andplusmin;1percent are used for the identification of diesel oil (per Section 13.2)and for determination of the concentration of diesel oil in the mud sample(per Section 14).13.2 Distribution of peak area ratios (Reference 9)_diesel oil is furtheridentified by comparing the distribution of the area ratios of peaks inthe chromatogram of the calibration standard (Section 6.5) to these sameratios in the chromatogram of the sample.13.2.1 Compare the chromatograms of the calibration standard and the sample.13.2.2 Select the 10 peaks largest in area in the chromatogram of the samplethat are in relative retention time agreement with the corresponding peaksin the calibration standard (Section 13.1) and appear to be unique to thecalibration standard. Exclude the solvent peak, the internal standard peak,any peaks that elute prior to the internal standard peak, and any multipletand unresolved peaks. For most samples, these will be the n-alkane peaks.13.2.3 Using the largest peak of the 10 peaks as reference, divide thearea of each of the other nine peaks by the area of this largest peak.Repeat this division process for the same 10 peaks in the calibration standard.13.2.4 Compare the ratios of areas of the nine peaks in the sample withthe respective ratios of the areas of the nine corresponding peaks in thereference standard.13.2.4.1 If all of these ratios agree within andplusmin;21 percent, dieselhas been positively identified. The quantity of diesel oil is then determinedper Section 14.13.2.4.2 If any of the ratios do not agree with andplusmin;21 percent, aninterference is suspected.13.2.4.3 If other peaks can be found that agree in relative retention time(Section 13.1) and in ratio (Section 13.2.4.1), use these peaks for quantitationper Section 14. If 10 peaks that agree cannot be found, Method 1625 (RevisionC or greater) shall then be used to determine the presence and concentrationsof the polynuclear atomic hydrocarbons (PAH's) present in the sample.14. Quantitative Determination14.1 Oil content by gravimetry.14.1.1 Subtract the weight of the preweighed receiving flask and boilingchip (Section 10.2.3) from the final weight of the receiving flask (Section10.3.2).14.1.2 Calculate the concentration of oil content in the sample using thefollowing equation:<ITAG tagnum="20">Equation 5:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp1,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,i1,12,3,5</C> <H1>C(mg/kg)=</H1><H1>W</H1><T2>f</T2><H2>W</H2><T2>s</T2><H1>andmultiply;1000</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">W<T2>f</T2>=final weight of oil in mg (from Section 14.1.1)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">W<T2>s</T2>=wet weight of sample in grams (from Section 10.1.1)</ITAG>14.2 Diesel oil by gas chromatography14.2.1 Compute the concentration of diesel oil in the sample extract usingthe combined response factor given in Section 7.3.3 for the 10 largestpeaks chosen in Section 13 using the following equation:<ITAG tagnum="20">Equation 6:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp1,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,i1,14,32</C> <H1>C</H1><T2>ex</T2>(mg/mL)=<H1>(C</H1><T2>is</T2>)[A<T2>s(1)</T2>+A<T2>s(2)</T2> . . . +A<T2>s(n)</T2>]<H2>(A</H2><T2>is</T2>)(RF combined)<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">C<T2>ex</T2> is the concentration of the oil in the extract</ITAG>14.2.2 Calculate the concentration of diesel oil (in mg/kg) in the sampleas follows:<ITAG tagnum="20">Equation 7:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,i1,12,11,6</C><H1>C(mg/kg)=</H1><H1>(C</H1><T2>ex</T2>)(V<T2>ex</T2>)<H2>(W</H2><T2>s</T2>)<H1>andmultiply;1000</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">V<T2>ex</T2>=final extract volume in mL (from Section 10.3.3 or 14.2.3)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">W<T2>s</T2>=wet weight of sample in grams (from Section 10.1.1)</ITAG>14.2.3 If the area of any peak in the chromatographic pattern exceeds thecalibration range of the GC, the extract is diluted by a factor of 10 withmethylene chloride, 100 uL is withdrawn and mixed with 90 uL of the internalstandard solution (Section 6.4) and the diluted extract is reanalyzed.14.3 Results of analyses of drilling fluids are reported in units of mg/kg(wet weight) to three significant figures. Results for samples that havebeen diluted are reported at the least dilute level at which the peak areasare within the calibration range (Section 14.2.3).15. Complex Samples15.1 The most common interference in the determination of diesel oil isfrom mineral oil in the drilling fluid (see Sections 3 and 13). Drillingfluids may also contain proprietary lubricity additives that can interferewith the identification and quantification of diesel oil.15.2 The presence of mineral oil or other interfering oils and additivescan often be determined by comparing the pattern of chromatographic peaksin the sample with the patterns of chromatographic peaks in the referencestandard (Sections 6.5 and 10.1.3) and in the spiked sample (Section 8.3).15.3 In cases where there is a mixture of diesel and mineral oil, the analystmay have to choose some of the smaller early or late eluting peaks presentin the chromatographic pattern of the diesel oil, and not present in thechromatographic pattern of the mineral oil, to determine the diesel content.Quantification using these peaks is performed by using these peaks forcalibration (Section 7) and for determination of the final concentration(Section 14).16. Method Performance16.1 This method was developed by two laboratories that tested for dieseloil in drilling fluids (mainly drilling muds) over a two-period. The performancedata for this method are based on the performance of the method in thesetwo laboratories (Reference 10).16.2 The most commonly occurring drilling fluid in the tests of this methodwas a seawater lignosulfonate mud (EPA Generic Mud No. 8). The estimateddetection limit for diesel oil in this mud is 100 ug/kg.<ITAG tagnum="84">References</ITAG>1.
