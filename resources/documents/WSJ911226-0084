Tom Harkin'scritics would like to see him face the consequences.   Already in the presidential campaign, the Iowa lawmakerhas found himself accused of misleading reporters about thetroubles of his deaf brother. In addition, the budgetarymathematics he weaves into his basic stump speech have beenchallenged on network television. And allegations about Mr.Harkin's truthfulness extend back well before the currentcampaign, back to his claims that he was a combat pilot inVietnam.</LP><TEXT>   Republicans complain the loudest. &quot;What galls me most isthat Tom Harkin has absolutely no problem in saying somethingthat's not true, and with a straight face,&quot; says TomSynhorst, a political consultant who managed Republican TomTauke's losing campaign against Mr. Harkin in 1990.   Mr. Harkin denies he has a habit of stretching the truth.He emphasizes that he has always thought of himself as a&quot;straight shooter,&quot; and says he never intended to mislead. Inthe future, he says, he probably will tell the story abouthis brother's job experiences more carefully. He standsbehind his budget figures.   Even if Mr. Harkin's attitude toward facts seems to someof his critics to be carefree, he has hardly broken newground. Lyndon Johnson was carefree about the truth almostevery day. This year, Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York was a bitcarefree in explaining away his suggestion, tape-recordedprior to the outbreak of the war in the Persian Gulf, thatIraq might be tempted to withdraw from Kuwait in return forsome land and oil. Richard Nixon said he was not a crook.   In Mr. Harkin's case, the questions that have lingeredlongest concern his Navy record. Mr. Harkin did serve in theNavy during the Vietnam era, but exactly what he did, and forhow long, remain a matter of some dispute.   &quot;After I got out of college,&quot; he says in his standardstump speech, &quot;I spent eight years, eight months and eightdays as a Navy pilot.&quot; His military record, though, shows heserved five years on active duty, from Nov. 21, 1962, untilNov. 30, 1967. The senator arrives at the eight-year figureby adding on three years in the ready reserve. Mr. Harkin'smilitary record, acquired by The Wall Street Journal througha Freedom of Information request, shows he remained active inthe reserves, ready or not, until Oct. 1, 1989, retiring withthe rank of commander.   &quot;I'm right,&quot; Mr. Harkin says. &quot;I was a Navy flyer foreight years, eight months and eight days. I have acertificate to prove it.&quot;   What he did while on active duty is even more confusing.In 1979, Mr. Harkin, then a congressman, participated in around-table discussion arranged by the Congressional VietnamVeterans' Caucus. &quot;I spent five years as a Navy pilot,starting in November of 1962,&quot; Mr. Harkin said at thatmeeting, in words that were later quoted in a book, Changingof the Guard, by Washington Post political writer DavidBroder. &quot;One year was in Vietnam. I was flying F-4s and F-8son combat air patrols and photo-reconnaisance supportmissions. I did no bombing.&quot;   That clearly is not an accurate picture of his Navyservice. Though Mr. Harkin stresses he is proud of his Navyrecord -- &quot;I put my ass on the line day after day&quot; -- heconcedes now he never flew combat air patrols in Vietnam.   He was stationed at the U.S. Naval Air Station at Atsugi,Japan. Damaged aircraft were flown into Atsugi for repairs orsometimes flown out of Atsugi to the Philippines for moresubstantial work. Mr. Harkin says he and three other Navypilots flew these ferry flights. And, when the planes hadbeen repaired, he and his fellow pilots took them up on testflights. &quot;I had always wanted to be a test pilot,&quot; he says.&quot;It was damned demanding work.&quot;   How much time did he actually spend in Vietnam? &quot;Iwouldn't really know,&quot; he says. He estimates that over aperiod of about 12 months he flew in and out of Vietnam &quot;adozen times, maybe 10 times.&quot;   But what about those combat air patrols and thephoto-reconnaisance support missions? He says he did flycombat air patrols, in Cuba, in 1965 and 1966. He wasstationed at Guantanamo Bay, the U.S. base, &quot;and we were onfrigging alert for 18 months, the whole time I was there.&quot; Hewould take off whenever a U-2 American spy plane flew by, incase Cuban dictator Fidel Castro scrambled his fighters tointercept it. And he says he flew photo-reconnaisancemissions too, out of Andrews Air Force Base, near Washington,D.C., while he was serving in the ready reserve.   In explaining his Vietnam experience at that congressionalround-table in 1979, Sen. Harkin says that in retrospect&quot;maybe I didn't say it right.&quot;   The round-table wasn't the only time he talked aboutextensive Vietnam service. In April of 1981, Mr. Harkin toldHarold E. Roberts, publisher of the Creston, Iowa, NewsAdvertiser, that in Japan he was assigned to a squadron where&quot;we flew many missions to Vietnam and the Philippines.&quot; Andin a short April 1, 1980, statement in the CongressionalRecord attacking the Veterans Administration for the way itwas handling claims related to the herbicide Agent Orange,Mr. Harkin said that &quot;as a Vietnam veteran in Congress, Ifeel particularly responsible for seeing that this issuecontinues to command our attention.&quot; Mr. Harkin says healways refers to himself as a &quot;Vietnam-era veteran,&quot; andthinks the statement in the Congressional Record might be amisprint.   Mr. Harkin's Navy record shows his only decoration is theNational Defense Service Medal, awarded to everyone on activeservice during those years. He did not receive either theVietnam Service medal or the Vietnam Campaign medal, thedecorations given to everyone who served in the SoutheastAsia theater. &quot;We didn't get them for what we did,&quot; Mr.Harkin says. &quot;It's never bothered me.&quot;   It was after Mr. Harkin's return to civilian life that hefirst publicly demonstrated how tough and calculating hecould be. He had as a patron Democratic Rep. Neal Smith ofIowa, who eventually gave him a plum assignment as a staffaide for a select House committee about to depart on afact-finding trip to Vietnam.   While in Vietnam, Mr. Harkin photographed the infamous ConSon Island &quot;tiger cages&quot; used by the South Vietnamesegovernment to house political prisoners. In an October 1970article in the Progressive magazine, Mr. Harkin wrote that,worried that his incriminating photographs would be seized bypro-war forces opposed to their publication, he gave them toCongressman Smith, who, cautioning him that &quot;publicity neverdoes any good,&quot; indicated he would lock the photos in hissafe &quot;for six months or so until this blows over.&quot;   &quot;I could not believe my ears,&quot; Mr. Harkin wrote. &quot;That wasthe most public-be-damned statement I had ever heard from anelected official in our government.&quot;   As soon as he and the members of the committee arrivedback in Washington, Mr. Harkin wrote, he urged Mr. Smith toremove the rolls of film from his suitcase so they could berushed to the congressman's office safe. Then &quot;I reachedover, grabbed the film . . . and put the film in my pocket.Smith turned around. `OK, let's go put them {the rolls offilm} in the safe,' he said. `No,' I replied, `I am going tokeep them. . . . I feel I have a higher obligation to those500 human beings in the tiger cages.&quot; He subsequently soldsome of the photos to Life magazine for $10,000, which helpedpay his way through law school.   Twenty-one years later, Mr. Smith declines to discuss thetiger-cage episode but says through an aide that he maintainswarm relations with Mr. Harkin. He occasionally appears atMr. Harkin's campaign rallies, where he is introduced as anold and valued friend and tutor.   In his presidential campaign, as in most of his otherraces, Mr. Harkin frequently refers to his brother Frank, whohas been deaf since age nine. At one breakfast meeting withreporters, Mr. Harkin told how Frank had a good job for 23years in a Des Moines plant, until new owners broke theunion. Frank was &quot;busted&quot; too, he said, ending up on a human&quot;trash heap.&quot; The only job he could find was cleaningtoilets. &quot;That's what's happening in America today,&quot;exclaimed Mr. Harkin.   Actually, it turns out, Frank lost his job years ago. Sen.Harkin put Frank back on his feet in the 1970s, when JimmyCarter was president, by finding him a job as a postal workerunder a new program aimed at helping disadvantaged workers.Frank worked there until his retirement with health benefitsand a pension.   Mr. Harkin says &quot;the story about my brother is true andfactual. What happened to him is happening more and moretoday.&quot; But he adds, &quot;maybe I should add the rest of thestory, that a Democratic president and a Democratic Congresspassed legislation to reach out and help people like Frank,and that Reagan tried to kill the program.&quot;   The most recent flap over Mr. Harkin's facts came duringthe recent debate among the Democratic candidates televisedover NBC. In the debate, moderator Tom Brokaw challenged thesenator's stump-speech assertion that for the $850 millioncost of a single B-2 bomber, the government could enroll120,000 more kids in Head Start, immunize two million morechildren, double the amount of research on Alzheimer'sdisease and provide maternal and child health care for everylow-income woman in America. By NBC's calculations, Mr.Brokaw said, all that would cost, not $850 million, but about$1.8 billion.   Mr. Harkin charges Mr. Brokaw with &quot;unfair press,&quot;explaining that the disparity grows out of differinginterpretations of the phrase &quot;every low-income woman inAmerica.&quot; The senator says he is talking only about anestimated 100,000 women who don't receive any prenatal careat all, and not about the one million mothers from age 16 to44 who are generally listed as living in poverty.   Even by Mr. Harkin's standard, a Wall Street Journalestimate puts the cost of the senator's list at about $1.1billion, more than the estimated price of a B-2.</TEXT></DOC>
