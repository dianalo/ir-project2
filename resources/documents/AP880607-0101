In a front-page story, the conservative daily quoted Shiite andSunni Moslem sources in Beirut as saying the United States openedtalks with Iranian officials almost two months ago in the hope offinding a ``legal'' formula to secure the release of the Americanhostages.   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidhe was not aware of any such contacts and said he had not seen theTimes story.   ``As you know, we're always talking to people at various levelsabout the hostage situation,'' he said. ``These stories come upfrequently and usually aren't correct, and I don't think this one iseither.''   Asked if President Reagan would be bothered by having his termend without the liberation of the American hostages in Lebanon,Fitzwater said, ``Well, he'll be very disappointed, of course. Thehostage situation has been one of enormous concern and frustrationto the president.''   Times correspondent Robert Fisk, writing from west Beirut, saidseparate contacts by the three countries with the Iranians are allreported to have taken place in Europe.   ``So widely are the reports now believed in Beirut that theAmerican Embassy here has been approached by several organizationsrepresenting kidnapped Lebanese in the hope that Washington mightinclude other hostages in its bargaining with Tehran,'' Fisk said.   Eighteen foreigners are missing in Lebanon including nineAmericans, three Britons and one West German. Terry Anderson, 40,the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press who waskidnapped March 16, 1985, is the longest-held hostage.   The Shiite and Sunni sources were quoted as saying that ``legal''methods of freeing the hostages would involve the paying ofcompensation to Iran and the release of Iranian assets which werefrozen after the 1979 revolution that overthrew Shah Mohammad RezaPahlavi.   Iran has repeatedly demanded that the United States deliver largequantities of American weapons and armor paid for by the shah, thepaper said.   ``What has emerged only too clearly in west Beirut is that Irancontrols all the foreign hostages still alive here and that evenincidents like the Kuwait Airlines hijacking ultimately have theirroots in Tehran,'' Fisk said.   ``This is why the increasing reports here of contacts betweenLondon, Washington, Bonn and Tehran are met with so littleincredulity,'' he said.   Fisk reported new details on several hostage-takings.   For example, he said, Terry Waite, the Archbishop of Canterbury'sspecial envoy, is now believed to have been detained in January 1987by relatives of Mohammed Ali Hamadi, who was arrested in WestGermany four days earlier and is a suspect in the 1985 hijacking ofa TWA jet. Waite went to Beirut to meet with the kidnappers ofAnderson and another American.   Fisk quoted sources close to the Shiite Moslem Amal militia assaying Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, the American officer whocommanded a United Nations observer group and was kidnapped in southLebanon in February, was targeted for abduction by the IranianEmbassy in Beirut.</TEXT></DOC>
