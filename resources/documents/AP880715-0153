Bradleyreached the 85,989-ton Sea Victory in international waters, a U.S.Navy spokesman said.   ``She went within five miles of Farsi and they came out to gether,'' he said. ``She turned tail and ran straight out. They wentback home and left her alone.''   U.S. officials said the warship could not have defended thetanker close to the island because Navy ``rules of engagement''allow intervention only in international waters and the UnitedStates recognizes a 12-mile limit around Farsi.   Shipping executives said Iran is preparing a new oil platform inthe southern Persian Gulf equipped with facilities that suggestmilitary purposes, possibly defensive, as well as civilian.   A radio report from the Liberian-registered tanker's Greekcaptain said the speedboats attacked three times, making ``lots ofholes,'' starting a small fire and slightly wounding the first mate.   It was the second attack in three days near Farsi in thenorthern Persian Gulf. Iranian Revolutionary Guards use the island60 miles off Saudi Arabia as a base for attacks on neutralcommercial shipping from speedboats armed with machine guns andgrenade launchers.   Attacks in the area have increased recently after months ofcomparative calm. Gulf shipping executives said the Iranian raidsapparently were reprisals for two Iraqi air raids on Iraniantankers last week.   Iraq raids tankers owned or chartered by Iran in an attempt tostop the oil exports with which its enemy finances the 8-year-oldwar, and Iran responds with attacks on ships trading with gulf Arabstates. More than 500 ships have been attacked by both sides.   U.S. helicopters and Iranian speedboats exchanged fire Tuesdayafter the boats attacked a Panamanian-registered tanker west ofFarsi. U.S. pilots said one boat may have been damaged.   On Friday, the Sea Victory was bound for Kuwait when speedboatsattacked at about 2 p.m., and the captain issued a distress call.   The Bradley, on patrol 25 miles away, replied and sped towardthe reported location. When the two vessels met less than an hourlater, the fire was out and the Sea Victory was in no danger, theNavy spokesman said.   ``There was no involvement of U.S. forces with the gunboats andno U.S. helicopters entered territorial waters. We do not violateterritorial waters of any country,'' he said.   Although military officials said the distress message was a``general Mayday call,'' shipping executives quoted radio monitorsas saying the tanker asked ``American warships'' for help. Theinformants said later the captain shouted, ``We want the navy! Wewant the helicopters to chase them away!''   Under the broader ``rules of engagement'' that took effect twomonths ago, U.S. warships may intervene in attacks on ships ofnon-U.S. registry if they request help, are not connected wtheither of the belligerents and are in international waters.   Before that, the Navy could offer armed protection only toU.S.-flag ships.   Shipping executives who mentioned the new Iranian oil platformsaid any military role might be strictly defensive.   The platform, under construction in a port on the Arab side ofthe gulf, will have electronic gear, radar and landing pads tohandle three helicopters at once, and steel plating, apparently toprotect it from attack, the executives said.   They quoted Iranian officials as saying it would be anadministrative base for Iran's fleet of shuttle tankers deliveringoil to the Larak Island export terminal in the Strait of Hormuz.The informants spoke on condition of anonymity.   Iran has used oil platforms as military communications bases andU.S. forces demolished three, one last October and two on April 18,in retaliation for attacks on ships and helicopters.   ABC television said equipment being installed on this platformcould make it an offshore base ``capable of coordinating sea andairborne attacks upon the U.S. Navy.''   Some shipping executives agreed it could monitor traffic and bea base for speedboat or helicopter raids, but were skeptical thatits main purpose was military.   ``The term armor-plated is exaggerated,'' one said. ``They arereinforcing it with steel, but they are not turning it into atank.''   He said it probably would have anti-aircraft guns to helpprotect Larak from Iraqi air raids.</TEXT></DOC>
