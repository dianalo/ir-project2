However, with current oil prices limitingoptions, operators are not precluding the use of new technology, butmost of the industry is playing it safe, going for the tried-and-truetechnologies of the past. Each field- and, for that matter, each well- must be taken on a case-by-case basis. For an operator to survive,its engineers must mesh old and new technology together to develop oiland gas reserves in the most economically efficient way. This articlediscusses some areas that need consideration.</TEXT></DOC>
