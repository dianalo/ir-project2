Sales increased 12%, to 2.35 billion dollars ($1.7 billion) from 2.11 billion dollars. Other revenue declined 45%, to 74.9 million dollars from 136.5 million dollars.    BHP said earnings rose mainly because of increased profit from petroleum and minerals operations. Petroleum results were aided by higher world oil prices and increased production, while minerals results reflected a dividend from a Brazilian iron-ore venture and improved earnings from other operations.    Steel and coal earnings fell.    Despite the profit boost, BHP's stock closed unchanged in Australian trading Friday, at 10.95 dollars ($8.04). </TEXT></DOC>
