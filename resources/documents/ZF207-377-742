 If so, you'll love the latest round of PC police games.andP;  Withenough random violence to satisfy even the most determined psychopath, thesegames give you an opportunity to fight crime without ever firing a shot.andM;Most stick to the tried-and-true arcade format, but a few manage to go beyondthe karate kicks and automatic weapons to challenge your wits and give you asemirealistic taste of life on the streets.andP;  Others offer a chance to see thedarker side of the law, letting you play the part of the criminal.andM;Equipped with EGA/VGA graphics and mouse and joystick operation, today'scops-and-robbers games are as technically advanced as any other breed ofcomputer entertainment.andP;  The action is nonstop, and the dexterity needed towin can be elusive, even for a quick-acting arcade wizard.andP;  In the end,however, many cop games fall short of satisfaction, leaving you feeling moreempty than exhilarated.andP;  You can kick in only so many doors and shoot at onlyso many crooks before you begin to question the responsibility and maturityof this kind of entertainment.andM;To play (and win) cop games, you need a taste for squalor, a lust for blood,and a craving for revenge.andP;  It also helps if you have a fast computer,top-drawer graphics hardware, and several hours of spare time.andM;Karate CopandM;If Operation: Cleanstreets were a movie, it would star Charles Bronson orChuck Norris, with Clint Eastwood delivering the game's narration:andM;&quot;YOU are Inspector Harry, and your mission is to recover and destroy thelatest shipment of drugs, which is in the hands of street pushers.&quot;andM;So far, so good, but there's a small credibility problem here: what sort ofpolice chief sends his best man, armed only with four karate kicks and two(largely ineffective) punches, up against an army of knife-, brick-, andchainsaw-wielding psychotics?andP;  In the United States, most cops carry guns.andM;Operation: Cleanstreets is an &quot;if-it-moves-kill-it&quot; romp set in an anonymousslum.andP;  Each of the nine screens has its own set of criminals.andP;  Your job is toeliminate the crooks, seize their drugs, and dump the narcotics in a handytrash fire.andM;The game has five levels of difficulty; the neighborhood doesn't change, butthe number and variety of thugs do.andP;  Yet even at the most challenging levels,it's the sluggish controls, not the criminals that get you.andP;  When two punksattack on foot at the same time that two more come at you on a motorcycle,you just can't move fast enough.andM;Success in Operation: Cleanstreets depends mainly on a combination of highand roundhouse kicks that will take care of most opponents, even the kung fuwarriors in Chinatown, who kick back.andP;  Try to match the game's rhythms andsense when to back off.andM;Unfortunately, that's about all there is to Operation: Cleanstreets.andP;  There'slittle interaction with the environment, and you see all the screens on yourfirst beat.andP;  While the visually flawless program effectively creates itsurban atmosphere, it doesn't remain rewarding for very long.andP;  The first timeyou play you're blown away; the second time, you're bored.andM;Mad MaxandM;Technocop tries to fight boredom by tacking a driving game onto the standardkillfest.andP;  Before you can fight the criminals, you've got to track them down.andO;Once you find them, you've got to overcome their bodyguards and drag thekingpins off to justice.andM;On the road, your car's side-mounted machine guns will blast vehicles thatget in your way; at close quarters, you use a weapon straight out of&quot;Courageous Cat&quot;: it shoots either dissolvo-rays or giant nets to snare ahalf-dozen different kinds of goons.andM;Technocop makes up for lack of screen detail with a nice sense of humor:self-referential graffiti, tied-up damsels in distress whom you can't save,and crates and corpses strewn in the halls.andP;  The game play is elementary: itconsists of navigating mazes of rubble and shooting everyone in sight.andP;  Theentertainment value of all this doesn't last for long.andM;While the fighting portion holds marginal interest, the chase scenario isirredeemably derivative.andP;  You steer from behind, shooting at other cars andtrying to stay on the road when it curves.andP;  Even if this were done well, itwould be unoriginal.andP;  And it isn't done well.andP;  At top speed, the driving gameplods through its paces like a worn-out marathoner, and long passages thatrequie no steering go by.andP;  The other cars are far easier to avoid than toshoot.andP;  You drive through a landscape so bland that it could be the Saharawere it not for the occasional tree and the eye-searing purple and bluestriations that are supposed to be a highway.andP;  Add a hideous engine whine,and you have one of the most unappealing driving games ever assembled.andM;And it doesn't even make sense.andP;  You aren't tracking anyone down.andP;  You'rejust following the road wherever it leads, stopping arbitrarily when a timerruns out.andP;  When your car pulls over, no buildings are in sight; then, all ofa sudden, you find yourself inside a run-down tenement.andM;Where did this building come from?andP;  Where will it go when you leave?andM;The exruciatingly dull animation continues inside the building.andP;  In theamount of time that it takes your character to raise his arm and fire a shot,a real thug could have mugged you and spent the money.andM;This is what comes of trying to do too much.andP;  If Epyx had scrapped thedriving portion and polished up the fighting segment, Technocop might havebeen very good.andP;  Or, vice versa, if the designers had decided to hone thedriving game ...andP;  who knows?andM;TransformersandM;Cyber Cop is about as close to police work as Indiana Jones is toarchaeology.andP;  Players guide a robot through three &quot;domains&quot; (air, land, andwater) as the mode of transportation transforms into a helicopter, a tank, ora submarine, as appropriate.andP;  Swarms of alien monsters attack the robot,which uses a laser to fight back.andP;  Once the domains are all cleaned up, aspaceship swoops in, snatches up the robot, and drops it into a new, fullyinfested world.andP;  And so on.andP;  And so on.andM;Cyber Cop is almost unplayable.andP;  The 3-D perspective requires players to moveon the diagonal, equally awkward from the keyboard or with a joystick; asingle keystroke turns the robot, but it takes another to set it in motion.andO;The land and water domains have diagonal walkways to follow, but they are ona different diagonal than the one along which the robot travels, makingmovement extremely difficult.andP;  Worse, the ability to fire your laser cuts inand out erratically and is strictly limited to the four diagonal directions.andO;Hitting an alien depends more on its movement than on your aim.andM;White-Collar CrimeandM;While most cop games resemble comic books, cartoons, or B movies, Corruptionreproduces the real world in meticulous detail.andP;  With a script that readslike the morning paper, Corruption straddles the line between satire andcensure while depicting corporate politics, shunted responsibility, dirtycops, sting operations, insider trading, medical malpractice, financialcollapses, and all the other trappings of modern life.andP;  It's so familiar,it's delicious.andM;As a Corruption player, you walk the streets of modern London, traffic lightsand all.andP;  You're Derek Rogers, a working stiff in the world of high finance.andO;A new promotion, a new office, a new secretary, and a personal parking spacefor your BMW are just some of the perks that open the game on a suspiciouslypleasant note.andM;Soon enough, everything starts to come apart at the seams.andP;  Your boss setsyou up to take the fall for a double-dealing scam; his boss is in on it;someone's left a pouch of cocaine in the tank of the executive toilet; thepolice want you to wear a wire to expose an illegal casino operating out of ahigh-profile London restaurant.andP;  .  .  .  The plot is thicker than a Londonfog.andP;  The narrative's dry wit and careful descriptions create a city with adepth and texture unusual in computer games.andM;Before long, you'll find yourself engaged in lying, sequealing, shoplifting,cutting deals, and manipulating your associates ...andP;  and you'll understandwhy Corruption bears the warning &quot;for adult minds only.&quot;andM;The user interface is excellent, as is the packaging: along with the disksand a few pages of clues, you get a sampling from Derek's appointment book,an audio recording from a secret meeting with the boss (the flip side holdsthe game's nifty sound track), and a poker chip.andP;  The otherwise flawless gameis marred by one bug: after I agreed to wear the wire, the police let me go,only to rearrest me the instant I left the station.andP;  You'll also have to getaccustomed to some of the game's Briticisms: a toilet tank is called a&quot;cistern,&quot; and don't try spelling cheque &quot;check.&quot;andP;  Those quibbles aside,Corruption offers gloriously intelligent, sophisticated, and sinfully wickedfun.andM;Guilty PleasureandM;King of Chicago is also glorious, sophisticated, and wicked; it, too, comeswith a warning on the package (&quot;Adult language may not be suitable forchildren&quot;).andP;  But where Corruption engages the player's intellect andimagination, King of Chicago is pitched to a different set of senses.andM;Corruption is basically a text adventure; its excellent graphics areincidental.andP;  More of an interactive movie, King of Chicago is a visualexperience.andP;  It uses speech and thought balloons where necessary, but reliesprimarily on lavish animation to tell its story.andM;The elaborate sets, period costumes, and snappy gangland dialogue help youlose yourself in the world that made Jimmy Cagney and Edward G. Robinsonfamous: 1930s Chicago.andP;  Capone has been set up for tax evasion; his turf isup for grabs.andP;  You're Pinky Callahan, a two-bit hood with a chip on yourshoulder the size of Oklahoma and ambitions to match.andP;  You goal in life is tobecome ...andP;  well, you can figure it out.andM;King of Chicago is a guilty pleasure, like eating Haagen Dazs or renting aThree Stooges movie.andP;  You may feel a little silly or even slightly ashamed,but it's too much fun to stop.andP;  The game is full of goofy, campy touches: theart deco skylines and the way characters' heads are too big for their bodies.andO;Perhaps best of all is a politician who bears an uncanny resemblance toHarvey Korman in Blazing Saddles.andP;  Despite a few repetitious game elements,there is enough player involvement to create a substantially different storyeach time.andP;  In fact, you don't even have to play the game; the program canmake its own choices and construct an online movie for you.andM;The stories are meaty little morality plays, chock-full of gang war,betrayal, family business, hired muscle, and all the other elements that makegangster pictures so much fun.andP;  Pinky always seems to die at the end, but sowhat?andP;  He deserves it: Mamma Callahan tells Pinky to stay away from his moll,Lola.andP;  But does he listen?andP;  No.andP;  He winds up double-crossed and dumped inLake Michigan, with Mamma crying for her good little boy gone bad.andM;King of Chicago succeeds because it is such a thoroughly different kind ofgame that provides a unique entertainment experience.andM;With cop games, you can have it either way.andP;  You can indulge in arcade actionwith offersing such as Operation: Cleanstreets or opt for more sophisticatedfun with Corruption or King of Chicago.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
