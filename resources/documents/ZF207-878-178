(Computers andHardware)(Special Supplement)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Higgins, Steve.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>The high cost of multimedia systems and other limiting factors mayprevent the technology from infiltrating the mainstream.andP;  Becausethere is no common platform, managers of multimedia need to investin expensive equipment in order for the system to run together.andO;The expense of creating and running a system also limits users'accessibility, although an entry-level multimedia system is lessthan for full-motion and graphics-oriented systems.andP;  Developing a$2,000 system begins with a Macintosh Plus, to which is addedScreenRecorder software package, MacRecord sound digitizer andstandard Macintosh applications.andP;  The next step up is theincorporation of motion video into a presentation.andP;  An Amiga-basedsystem with video capability can cost less than $5,000.andP;  A numberof hardware and software manufacturers including Next Inc aredeveloping products to enter the under-populated multimediamarket.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Multimedia TechnologyCompatibilityProduct DevelopmentAccess Methods.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Steve HigginsandM;Before the vision of a multimedia &quot;virtual reality&quot; can be realized, theplatforms upon which such a world will be built must be set up.andM;That means managers of multimedia systems may have to make a heavy investmentin leading-edge PC equipment and ensure that it all works together.andM;The cost of the multimedia computer systems that are available today varieswidely -- from less than $2,000 for some multimedia workstation systems tomore than $100,000 for the top-of-the-line models.andM;Prices also depend on the types of software developed or purchased for amultimedia system.andM;Some consider the high cost of multimedia systems to be the largest stumblingblock to their widespread acceptance.andM;&quot;I think there is an access problem [to multimedia technology],&quot; said NickArnett, the editor of Multimedia Computing and Presentations, a monthlynewsletter published by Creative Strategies Research International, which isbased in Santa Clara, Calif.andM;&quot;How many people have access to multimedia information if it takes a $10,000computer system to get to it?&quot; he asked.andM;For rudimentary multimedia computing, however, the entry point is lower thanthat for full-motion and graphics-oriented systems, according to Arnett.andM;A Macintosh Plus can orchestrate a multimedia presentation when equipped withthe following components: a software package called ScreenRecorder, availablefrom Farallon Computing Inc. of Berkeley, Calif.; Farallon's sound digitizer,called MacRecord; and standard Macintosh applications (such as aspreadsheet).andM;The total hardware and software cost of such a system would be less than$2,000, Arnett said.andM;The system could be used to record the execution of an application for laterdisplay.andP;  ScreenRecorder records screen changes as a spreadsheet program isexecuted, while MacRecord, which digitizes sound, can be used to narrate theprogram execution.andM;Arnett recently used this system for a presentation of Lotus 1-2-3 running onthe Mac, and he explained that after creating the demo, he stored theinformation on one floppy disk.andM;&quot;On a floppy disk you can fit five minutes of digital audio and screenrecording,&quot; Arnett said.andM;&quot;A disk could be sent to the [corporate chief financial officer] to give himan introduction to what is on the spreadsheet for the quarter,&quot; said Arnett.andM;&quot;That is multimedia for the masses,&quot; Arnett added, &quot;something that you don'thave to be a programmer or an artist to use.&quot;andM;Taking multimedia a step further, a user may want to incorporate motion videointo a presentation.andM;Joe Conti, an independent consultant based in Los Angeles, started severalyears ago using an Amiga from Commodore Business Machines Inc. of WestChester, Pa., to create storyboards for motion-picture studios.andP;  Thecomputer-generated storyboards were used to replace hand-drawn ones.andO;According to Conti, the low-priced Amiga was particularly useful because agraphics processor was built into the machine, and a wide range of multimediasoftware was also available to run on the system.andM;Conti currently uses an Amiga 2500 to help design the prototypes forchildren's toys.andM;The designs begin as monochrome still images, which Conti transforms intomoving images using an array of software packages.andP;  These images are thenused by Mattel Inc. to test the attractiveness of the prospective products ongroups of children.andM;The total cost of equipment for creating the soundless videos was less than$5,000, Conti said.andM;That includes about $3,000 for an Amiga 2500, $500 for genlock equipment(hardware that combines videotape images with digital images), about $600 fora high-resolution monitor and nearly $700 worth of software.andM;Software packages that Conti used to create the prototype demonstrationsincluded Deluxe Paint III by Electronic Arts of San Mateo, Calif., a $120package for creating cartoons; Sculpt Animate 4D by Byte Works Inc., based inAlbuquerque, N.M., a $400 package for creating 3-D graphics; and Turbosilverby Impulse of Minneapolis, a $200 package for coloring images.andM;While only a scant number of multimedia workstations are available today --besides those for the Mac or Amiga, or high-end dedicated multimediaworkstations such as those offered by Silicon Graphics Inc. of Mountain View,Calif.andP;  -- many major players are ramping up to join the potentiallylucrative marketplace.andM;Intel Corp., of Hillsboro, Ore., is developing a digital video hardwareplatform that has won the endorsement of IBM.andM;IBM, which has headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., recently released a product lineknown as the Audio Visual Connection (AVC) -- comprising software and adapterboards that will support multimedia applications on its PS/2 machines.andM;The IBM AVC products will enable users to synchronize images and sound fortheir multimedia presentations.andM;Machines made by NeXT Inc., of Fremont, Calif., include many features thatmake them ideal candidates for running multimedia applications.andM;Among the attributes of NeXT's forthcoming systems are stereo sound createdwith a digital audio chip; a built-in CD ROM unit for storing the vastquantities of information contained in multimedia documents; and the systems'ability to combine text, sound and image for one electronic-mail message.andM;Even software vendor Microsoft Corp., of Redmond, Wash., is seeking to jointhe bandwagon, by developing extensions to OS/2 and Windows that pave the wayfor multimedia applications.andM;However, as Arnett noted, even a plethora of equipment does not ensure thatmultimedia applications will become part of the mainstream.andM;&quot;Much of the interest [in multimedia applications] is still in the industry,&quot;he said.andP;  &quot;Most of the people doing multimedia are computer companies orFortune 500 companies.andP;  There are not a lot of people now who know how todevelop these things.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
