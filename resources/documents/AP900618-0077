Rostenkowski said budget negotiations between Congress and theWhite House are going ``fairly well.'' But he said the budget isunlikely to include more money for cities.   ``We need to slash spending and raise taxes merely to reachground zero,'' the Chicago Democrat told more than 200 mayorsmeeting in his home city.   Two Democratic mayors challenged Rostenkowski to confrontPresident Bush and demand that aid to cities be increased. Theysaid the $500 billion or more needed to bail out the savings andloan industry should be found elsewhere.   ``We haven't got the votes,'' Rostenkowski said. He broke offthe questions and left the meeting after telling the mayorsgood-naturedly: ``I'm going to tell you like it is. If you don'tlike it, too bad.''   While the mayors expressed affection for Rostenkowski, asupporter of their causes, they did not like the message.   ``The cities are in desperate need,'' said Atlanta Mayor MaynardJackson. ``I really don't feel we have a partner in Washington.''   Rostenkowski said he was prepared to support an array of newtaxes. But he said his fellow Democrats want Bush to be the firstone to propose new taxes.   Rostenkowski was the first of two congressional Democrats toaddress the mayors on the first full day of their summer meeting.Nebraska Sen. Robert Kerrey was to address the mayors at lunch.   Rostenkowski delivered the dour message to the mayors a dayafter they gave initial approval to a broad, costly domestic agendathat calls on Congress to abandon the Gramm-Rudman law, complainingthe deficit-reduction measure unfairly chops urban programs first.   ``We're always first in line when it comes to cuts,'' NewBedford, Mass., Mayor John K. Bullard said Sunday as the mayorsgave initial approval to a sweeping and costly domestic agenda thatwould get most of its money from a Congress that has been cuttingaid to cities for a decade.   Sunday's votes by the conference's key policy committee must beratified by the full conference of more than 200 mayors onWednesday, but few changes are expected in a plan that blames manyurban woes on federal cutbacks and warns that urban tensions are atdangerous levels because cities are too strapped for cash to dealadequately with drugs and housing.   The centerpiece of the mayors' agenda is a handful of economicdevelopment proposals that include the demand that Congress repealthe Gramm-Rudman law.   The mayors said they were reluctant to take that stance but saidthey had little choice because Congress and the Bush administrationhave failed to negotiate a comprehensive deficit-reduction plan.Gramm-Rudman imposes automatic cuts if the deficit eclipses certaintargets.   ``The mayors across this country have got to say this is acharade,'' said Mayor Lee Robinson of Macon, Ga. ``We've got to sayenough is enough.''   Mayor Paul Soglin of Madison, Wis., added, ``Too many of ourmembers of Congress and the administration are seing this as acrutch to hide some of the problems of our economy.''   Conference staff members said the mayors would be the firstnational organization of elected officials to call fromGramm-Rudman's repeal.   Also included in the blueprint is a call for Congress to reducethe Social Security payroll taxes paid by nearly 120 millionworkers and lift the outside earnings cap on Social Securityrecipients.   The plan given initial approval also calls on Congress to stopusing the balance of the Social Security Trust fund to mask thetrue size of the deficit. And if formally adopted Wednesday it willput the mayors on the record in opposition to a reduction incapital gains taxes favored by President Bush.   The mayors' agenda, crafted at three days of committee meetings,also seeks new powers for cities to regulate and remove billboardsalong federal roads. But the conference committee that endorsed thepackage refused to adopt a measure that would have put the mayorson record against all tobacco and alcohol advertising.</TEXT></DOC>
