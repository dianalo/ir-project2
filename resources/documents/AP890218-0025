The agreement came soon after the exiled leadership of theAfrican National Congress said Mrs. Mandela had made mistakes andhad refused to heed earlier requests to disband the youth group,known as the Mandela United soccer team.   The Rev. Frank Chikane, who announced the agreement after meetingwith Mrs. Mandela for five hours, told a news conference that shehad asked him to find another place for the youths to stay.   Chikane, general-secretary of the South African Council ofChurches, said Mrs. Mandela told him she was following instructionsfrom her husband, Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned leader of theAfrican National Congress.   The outlawed ANC is the main guerrilla group fighting to end theapartheid system of legalized racial discrimination in South Africa.   The statement from the ANC's exile headquarters in Lusaka,Zambia, called on anti-arpartheid groups to help her solve theproblem. It was less critical than the condemnation of Mrs. Mandelathat was made Thursday by some of the most prominent leaders ofanti-apartheid organizations inside South Africa.   Chikane refused to say why Mrs. Mandela had not carried out herhusband's wishes immediately after she visited him in prison onWednesday.   He said he would find another place for the black youths to stayand make other arrangements for Mrs. Mandela's security. He did notelaborate.   She formed the Mandela United soccer club in 1986, saying shewanted to provide something to do for youths congregating on thestreets near her house.   But they became a group of bodyguards who lived at the house inSoweto and were often accused of antagonizing members of thecommunity.   Black leaders in Soweto have said they, Mandela and ANC officialsin exile have all called on her to disband the team but she hadrefused.   The controversy came to a head last month when three men told acommunity meeting of 150 top anti-apartheid activists the bodyguardmembers had abducted them to the Mandela home and beaten them.   The men said that 14-year-old activist Stompie Seipei was alsotaken and beaten but was hurt more seriously and was removed fromthem after two days. His body was found dumped in a Soweto field onJan. 6 with its throat cut. Police this week identified it in amorgue and opened a murder investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
