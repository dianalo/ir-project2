JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Bush administration, concerned the oilcrisis might be used to thwart clean air legislation, said Thursdaythe tougher pollution controls required by the bill could save asmuch as 1 million barrels of oil a day.   The report on the expected fuel savings, most of which wouldcome toward the end of the decade, was made public as some membersof Congress began questioning the wisdom of new and expensivepollution controls at a time of increasing energy costs.   House and Senate negotiators were continuing to try to resolvedifferences in separate clean air bills, but a meeting was abruptlycanceled Thursday. Participants had hoped to give final approval toa compromise reached last week on industrial controls to reduceurban smog.   The legislation, expected to cost the energy industry as much as$25 billion a year by the end of the decade when all itsrequirements go into effect, requires pollution controls onelectric power plants, factories and automobiles. It also requiresthe sale of cleaner gasoline blends in areas with serious smogproblems.   The study released Thursday by the Environmental ProtectionAgency concluded that as much as 500,000 barrels of oil a day maybe saved because tougher acid rain controls will prompt utilitiesto switch from oil to natural gas.   Another 500,000 barrels a day will be saved from requirement forautomobiles to burn cleaner fuels and from the increased use ofalternative fuel vehicles, the EPA said.   ``The total of 800,000 to 1 million barrels a day exceeds thetotal oil imports from Kuwait and Iraq,'' EPA Administrator WilliamReilly told reporters.   ``I think the energy implications ... make it more urgentlynecessary than ever for Congress to pass the bill,'' he said in alater telephone interview.   Bush administration officials have acknowledged some concern inrecent weeks that progress on the clean air legislation might bejeopardized amid the uproar over rising oil prices, the prospectsof an economic recession and the potential of oil shortages.   Only days after the Middle East crisis erupted last month,industry lobbyists began to question whether the time was right toimpose added financial costs to industry in the form of tougherpollution controls.   Some critics have argued that a number of provisions in the billwould increase oil consumption. For example, the use of scrubbersby utilities to reduce sulfur dioxide requires more energy, as doesthe refining of certain cleaner gasoline blends, they said.   But the EPA study said all that would be offset by moresignificant energy gains.   The study said that 300,000 to 500,000 barrels of oil could besaved by utilities that will be persuaded to switch from usingsulfur-containing oil to using natural gas because of the bill'sacid rain control provisions.   A requirement to use cleaner fuels and gasoline blends in citieswith serious smog problems and the increased use of alternativefuel vehicles also would lead to the savings of another 500,000barrels of oil daily, the study said.   The legislation requires that gasoline blends, which likelywould be 15 percent or more of ethanol or methanol, would berequired in at least nine cities.   Some of the cleaner fuel requirements would apply to as many as40 cities.</TEXT></DOC>
