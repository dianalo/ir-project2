X-ray CT showed the most pronouncedbilateral symmetrical calcifications in basal ganglia, followed by dentatenuclei, white matter of frontal lobes, and thalami. Long spin-echo (SE)images showed diffusely low signal intensity in basal ganglia, and partiallylow signal intensity in dentate nuclei with an almost symmetric distribution.Both long SE and inversion-recovery (IR) images showed lower signal intensitiesin more calcified areas of deep gray matter such as basal ganglia, dentatenuclei and thalami, possibly reflecting a decrease in proton densityon CT. The calcified area of white matter on CT was shown as a high signalintensity on long SE images and as a low signal intensity on IR images.This has implications for pathologic changes other than calcification.(Namekawa, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
