On the other hand, air-heated heat pumpis not much affected by the weather, but the efficiency is not so high,especially at low outdoor temperature reducing both the capacity andCOP. On the contrary, direct expansion type solar heat pump system cancollect heat from both solar and atmospheric heat rendering the possibilityof considerable efficiency improvement and the reduction of initial cost.Action principle of the system is that a cooling medium sealed in a heatpump absorbs heat and evaporates, and is compressed by a compressor intoa hot, pressurized gas, and then evolves heat in the condenser to concludea cycle. It is possible that its heat collection efficiency exceeds 1.The system performance was COP 3.6 when annual average heating capacitywas 3500 W and COP 3.7 outdoors.
