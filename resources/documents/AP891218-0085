Manuel Antonio Noriega's declaration of war seemsto have become a ``license for harassment'' against Americans.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, citing the weekendkilling of a U.S. officer in Panama and other incidents ofviolence, condemned ``a climate of aggression that is verydisturbing.''   And President Bush, in an interview today with reporters fromThe Associated Press and three other news agencies, called theslaying ``an enormous outrage.''   Bush said he is reviewing a range of options in response, andpointedly did not rule out military action.   ``I think a president, all presidents, have options, but theydon't discuss what they might be,'' Bush said. He repeated theanswer when asked if military action was among the optionsavailable.   The Defense Department said four American servicemen were tryingto flee a crowd of Panamanian troopers and civilians Saturday nightwhen the Panamanian soldiers opened fire, fatally wounding oneAmerican.   Another U.S. officer's ankle was grazed with a bullet, thestatement said. The Americans were traveling in a private car andwere off-duty and unarmed, it added.   The weekend violence came after Noriega had himself installed asthe country's supreme ruler on Friday and declared his country in astate of war with the United States.   ``We are monitoring the situation there on a continung basis,but we are very concerned that the declaration of war that wasstated ...may have been a license for harassment and threats and inthis case murder,'' Fitzwater said.   ``Other members of the U.S. military were detained, theirweapons and radios taken away from them after questioning, and thenreleased. The attack on the naval officer's wife certainly goesbeyond any previous experience. And the murder is outrageous initself,'' Fitzwater said.   The Defense Department said a Navy lieutenant and his wife hadbeen stopped at the same roadblock as the four servicemen.Panamanian soldiers blindfolded the Navy officer and his wife andtook them to a different location where they were interrogated forabout four hours, the department said.   During the interrogation, the Navy officer was repeatedly beatenand kicked in the groin, the statement said. His wife was slammedagainst a wall and sexually threatened, it said.   Fitzwater defended his characterization of the slaying as``murder,'' saying the U.S. officer ``was unarmed and he waskilled.''   He said most U.S. dependents have left the country or have beenmoved onto the U.S. military base there, a 9:50 p.m. curfew hadbeen imposed over the weekend on U.S. military personnel, and thebase put on a high state of alert.   ``There's no question that it's a dangerous situation,''Fitzwater said.   Earlier, deputy White House press secretary Roman Popadiuk saidthe Noriega regime ``is isolated both domestically andinternationally and has been using force and intimidation to thwartthe will of the Panamanian people. Acts such as those of lastevening are the consequence of such a regime.''   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney met Sunday with senior officialsat the Pentagon and issued a statement afterward saying, ``We'veseen General Noriega brutalize the people of Panama, crack down onhis own civilians and military alike after the last coup attempt,designate himself the leader of the country and declare a state ofwar with the United States.''   ``These actions have created an atmosphere in which PanamanianDefense Forces feel free to fire on unarmed Americans. We fullyexpect that those responsible will be brought to justice,'' Cheneysaid.   ``Ultimately, it is General Noriega himself who has encouragedthis kind of lawlessness. His own conduct sets an example ofcruelty and brutality. The lack of discipline and control in thePanamanian Defense Forces is further evidence that Panama is acountry without a government,'' Cheney said.   The names of Americans involved in the Panamanian violence werewithheld pending notification of relatives.   The Panamanian Defense Forces charged that the servicemen hadfired several shots at Noriega's military headquarters, woundingthree Panamanians, including a soldier and an infant.   Noriega, who is wanted in the United States on drug traffickingcharges, was declared Panama's chief of government Friday by arubber-stamp legislature, which declared Panama in a ``state ofwar'' with the United States.   The United States has imposed severe economic sanctions onPanama in a bid to force the ouster of Noriega. It recentlyannounced it is banning Panamanian-flag commercial vessels fromentering U.S. ports.</TEXT></DOC>
