The storm system developed in Okalahoma, bolted across Texas andmoved into Louisiana and Mississippi early today, blowing down powerlines, spinning off tornadoes and causing lightning-sparked fires.   Power outages affected 100,000 customers in the Dallas-Fort Wortharea alone, and at least 30,000 were still without power thismorning.   ``This is the worst storm damage in Dallas since the 1979 icestorm,'' said Dick Ramsey, a spokesman for Texas Utilities.   In Minnesota and South Dakota, thunderstorms developing ahead ofa cold front Sunday night produced severe weather, includingtornadoes.   At Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, Texas, a concert billed asthe Event of the Decade ended in chaos as the storm dumped heavyrain and hail on thousands of spectators.   ``It turned this place from a dust bowl into a mud bowl,'' saidSgt. Bob Matson. ``The hail was marble-sized for 20 minutes. Itdidn't matter where you were, there was no protection.''   Texas, Louisiana and their neighbors have endured over a week ofheavy rain left by Tropical Storm Allison. One Louisiana town gotnearly 29 inches in less than a week.   Flooding kept at least 500 people from their homes in southeastTexas and 200 in Mississippi. About 700 homes in Louisiana remainedflooded and the weather service said the flooding could ontinue fortwo weeks.   Allison and its aftermath were blamed for four deaths in Texasand three in Louisiana. The body of a Mississippi teen-ager who hadgone swimming in a swollen creek was recovered Sunday near Natchez.Officials today searched for a missing companion.   Sunday night's storm was not related to Allison, said HughCrowther of the National Weather Service in Kansas City, Mo. Theremnants of Allison moved into Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio.   Today's forecast was for scattered showers and thunderstorms inTexas, with heavier showers and thunderstorms in Louisiana andMississippi, Crowther said.   In Oklahoma City, a house caught fire Sunday after it was struckby lightning, causing $65,000 damage. High winds blew over a mobilehome in Ponca City, Okla., and downed some power lines and trees.   When the storm reached Abilene, concert-goers were still waitingto hear the headliners, Alabama and the Charlie Daniels Band. Butofficials canceled the concert when the storm hit.   Several people were taken to the hospital, for hail injuries andbecause of the heat, but officials said the injuries were minor.   John Val Lynch of Sweetwater, Texas, said he felt shortchanged,pointing out the tickets had read ``come rain or shine.''   ``We just got ripped off,'' he said. ``I spent about $100, and Idon't see anybody giving me my money back.''   Maj. Mary Beth Kilgore said the performers didn't want to riskdamaging their instruments or equipment. She said Alabama wouldhonor the tickets at the group's Wichita Falls concert on July 4 orrefunds would be offered.   East of Abilene, a performance at the Shakespeare Festival ofDallas came to an abrupt end as officials evacuated 1,000 patronsminutes before the stage collapsed under 90 mph winds. No one wasinjured.   Steve Player, of the festival's board of directors, saidperformers had just started ``Two Men of Verona-Texas,'' a jazzed-upversion of Shakespeare's play, when the storm moved in.   About 30 trees were uprooted and the 40-foot scaffolding holdinglighting and sound equipment wilted under the winds. Cast and crewhuddled backstage as the set collapsed around them.   ``We're very thankful we got the patrons out,'' Player said.``We're lucky we just got soaked.''   Near-record flooding in Liberty, 45 miles northeast of Houston,kept about 500 residents out of their homes and further threatenedlow-lying areas, even though sunny skies prevailed in southeastTexas on Sunday.   Soggy residents of lowlands along the Trinity River should seethe high waters subside later this week, emergency officials said.   In Mississippi's Bolivar County, more than 100 homes were floodedSaturday when the area received 5.3 inches of rain. People weretraveling in canoes in parts of Cleveland, said Joe Springer, aresident of the Mississippi town.   ``I've been sitting ... with my grandchildren and as far as I cansee it's water on the street both east and west,'' he said. ``You'venever seen so many kids out using the streets for a swimming pool.''   Officials in northern and central Louisiana reported at leastthree tornadoes. A home in Alexandria was damaged and businessdestroyed in Deville.   Rising water chewed away at an earthen dam in Louisiana's WinnParish, but civil defense director Steve Robertson today saidofficials believed the levee would hold.   A dam break could flood several more homes and delay drainage ofothers, Robertson said.</TEXT></DOC>
