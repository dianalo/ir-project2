By 10 p.m., the river was nearly 5 feet above flood level atAuburn, and civil emergency staffers were watching anxiously.   ``I'm just not comfortable,'' said Peter Van Gagnon, director ofthe Androscoggin County Emergency Management Agency. ``I've seen itquiet for hours and then suddenly take a jump of 2 or 3 feet.''   Early in the weekend, state and county emergency responseofficials advised residents to be ready to move quickly if theriver should suddenly rise.   Although no sweeping evacuations were made, families livingclosest to the river moved out as water filled their basements andforced the shutdown of household utilities.   Van Gagnon predicted the river in that area to crest ``just thisside of 20 feet'' late Saturday. The flood threshold ranges from 18feet to 13 feet at Auburn.   ``The difference in types of damage between 18 and 20 feet isincredible,'' said Gagnon. ``We don't want anyone to think it'sover yet and go back home.''   A flood watch is expected to remain in effect for the rest ofthe weekend for all but the most northerly section of the state,even though little rain is expected, according to the NationalWeather Service in Portland.   The watch applies to the Presumpscot, Kennebec, Saco andAndrocoggin as well as smaller rivers in the central andsouthwestern parts of the state.   The Kennebec was also expected to crest at North Sidney by earlyevening Saturday at three feet above flood level, while in Augustathe river was expected to crest at 1 foot below flood level, theweather service said.   The Saco crested early Saturday, but like most of the riverswill take a few days to recede, said David Brown of the MaineEmergency Management Agency. Friday's storm closed dozens of roadsand kept students out of school, but there were no seriousaccidents or fatalities reported.   The rain-swollen Presumpscott had been the quickest to rise,overflowing its banks in Westbrook and forcing a paper mill toclose Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
