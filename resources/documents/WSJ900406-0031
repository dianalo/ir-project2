Woody F. Lemons, the seventh officer of Vernon to beconvicted, was found guilty in December of 13 charges broughtas a result of a continuing investigation by the U.S. JusticeDepartment's Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force.</LP><TEXT>   The 30-year sentence, which stunned defense lawyers andelated government attorneys, came less than a week before theHouse Banking Committee is scheduled to hold hearings inDallas on the effectiveness of prosecution in fraud-relatedthrift failures, such as Vernon's.   The Justice Department has been investigating Vernon'slending practices since 1986 but has yet to bring criminalcharges against the thrift's former owner, Don R. Dixon. Thebanking committee has invited Mr. Dixon to testify next weekbut his attorney, William M. Ravkind of Dallas, said hisclient won't appear. Mr. Ravkind called Mr. Lemons's 30-yearsentence &quot;absurd.&quot;   In view of the scheduled hearings, Mr. Lemons's defenselawyer, Michael P. Gibson of Dallas, had urged U.S. DistrictJudge Robert B. Maloney to be mindful of the prosecutors'&quot;trophy mentality.&quot;   &quot;Mr. Lemons is the trophy for the federal agencies becausethey need to maintain their position that they're out theredoing good for the community,&quot; Mr. Gibson said.   But Judge Maloney, who has presided in at least two othercriminal cases related to Vernon Savings, referred to Mr.Lemons as &quot;a thief in every sense of the word&quot; and said hewanted to use the sentence &quot;to assure the public&quot; that thriftfraud won't be treated lightly.   Mr. Gibson called the 30-year sentence &quot;waydisproportionate to the crime.&quot; Mr. Lemons was convicted ofbank fraud and 12 other charges, including a charge that heaccepted a $212,000 kickback from the proceeds of a $46million real estate development loan.   Judge Maloney didn't impose a fine but will rule laterthis month on how much restitution Mr. Lemons will be orderedto make. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is seeking $9million to $10 million, according to Howard Feinstein, chiefof the conflicts and restitution unit of the FDIC's legalstaff.   The FDIC is taking a stronger role in criminal cases, asevidenced by a letter from FDIC Chairman William Seidman toJudge Maloney.   &quot;Woody Lemons abused his position of trust and defraudedthe institution, causing damages of over $18 million,&quot; Mr.Seidman wrote earlier this week. &quot;While I have considered thefact that Mr. Lemons has a family, I have also taken intoconsideration . . . that virtually all the costs of Mr.Lemons's criminal acts will be borne by the {thrift}resolution fund and, ultimately, the U.S. taxpayers.&quot;   Vernon was closed in November 1987 by the Federal Savingsand Loan Insurance Corp., which found a stunning 96% of thethrift's loans in default. The FSLIC committed $1.3 billionto fold the thrift's assets into Montfort SavingsAssociation, which became part of First Gibraltar Bank inlate December 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
