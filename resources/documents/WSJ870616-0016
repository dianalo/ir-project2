Under pressure from Congress and consumer groups, some banks have pared interest rates on credit cards. Bank Credit Card Observer, a Kendall Park, N.J., newsletter, says the average interest rate dropped to 17.29% in May from 17.82% in March.    But there appear to be some major catches. Many banks that cut rates have small numbers of cards outstanding. In other cases, lower rates are available only to the most creditworthy customers. And certain rate reductions are being offset by higher annual fees and elimination of interest-free grace periods.    &quot;There's no way credit-card rates are down,&quot; says David Robertson, vice president of Nilson Report, a Los Angeles-based newsletter, which computes an interest-rate average weighted according to the number of cards an issuer has outstanding. &quot;It doesn't matter for the Bank of Podunk with 100,000 cardholders to cut its rate to 14.5%, if Citicorp with 10 million cardholders is still charging 19.8%.&quot;    According to his weighted average, the average interest rate now charged &quot;is 18.83% and going up,&quot; as interest rates in general rise, he says.    The top-10 issuers account for about 34% of the cards outstanding, and in the majority of those cases their rates &quot;seem to be embedded in cement,&quot; according to Robert Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, a Miami newsletter. Their average interest rate is 19.19% for the standard VISA or MasterCard, unchanged since last March, according to Nilson Report.    Elgie Holstein of Bankcard Holders of America, a Washington, D.C., consumer group, adds, &quot;It's impossible to say that pressures (for lower rates) have produced very much that is very tangible.&quot; Furthermore, Mr. Robertson, Mr. Heady and others believe that the chances for any widespread reductions have ended with the recent rise in interest rates generally.    The lesson for credit-card users is to compare more than simply interest rates to find the best buy. Choosing a bank card now depends more on a consumer's credit habits. In particular: Does he or she pay off monthly charges in full or carry a large monthly balance?    Here are some new twists that banks are putting in their credit cards:    Elimination of Grace Periods   The grace period is the time, usually 25 days, that the cardholder has to pay the bill before the issuer starts charging interest. At some banks, particularly those with the lowest interest rates, the grace period is starting to disappear.    &quot;A surprisingly large number of banks have dropped the grace period,&quot; says Thomas Lynch, a senior vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York. (Chase is not one of those banks; it recently increased its grace period to 30 days from 25 days.)    Mercantile Bank in St. Louis, for example, charges 10% interest on balances of more than $1,000 and no annual fee for its standard Visa and MasterCard, but it has eliminated the grace period. And Highland Federal Savings andamp; Loan in Los Angeles dropped the grace period and lowered interest rates on all outstanding credit-card balances to 15.3%.    &quot;Lenders almost always make more money by lowering rates and eliminating the grace period,&quot; says Bank Rate Monitor's Mr. Heady.    Even consumers whose banks do offer grace periods sometimes fail to realize that it applies only to cardholders who pay off the full outstanding balance each month. So, if a cardholder carries any part of the balance into the next month, there is no grace period for new purchases made in that month.    Tiered Rates   A growing number of banks are establishing different interest rates, or tiers, for distinct groups of cardholders. Usually banks using this pricing system give lower interest rates to cardholders with higher monthly balances or multiple accounts at the bank. Clearly, the banks would rather give their best customers a break on rates than lose them to a competitor.    First Fidelity Bank, Newark, N.J., for example, has an intricate set of tiered rates for its standard VISA card. For cardholders who owe less than $1,000 the rate is 18.8%; on balances of $1,000 to $2,000, the rate is 17.8%; on $2,000 to $3,000, 16.8%; on $3,000 to $4,000, 15.8%, and on balances in excess of $4,000, 14.8%.    MNC Financial Corp., parent of Maryland National Bank and one of the top 10 card issuers, has adopted a similar strategy. David Spilman, vice president and treasurer, estimates that 60% of MNC cardholders get some break from the standard 17.9% rate. Its best rate -- for those with who owe more than $2,500 -- is 14.9%.    Robert B. McKinley, publisher of the newsletter RAM Research, estimates that 13% of banks have adopted the tiering strategy, roughly double the number a year ago.    Variable Rates   A third trend is toward variable rates. &quot;There's a definite move in that direction,&quot; says Mr. McKinley. Most cards currently charging interest rates below 15% use variable rates. Usually these cards' rates are pegged several points over the prime rate, which currently is 8.25%. First National Bank of Cincinnati charges prime plus six percentage points for a standard VISA.    Prime isn't the only index used. For its standard Visa and MasterCards, Marine Midland Bank in New York charges 9 percentage points over the rate on its three-month certificate of deposit, which currently is 6%.    USAA Federal Savings Bank in San Antonio, Texas, sets its interest rate at twice the rate on the six-month Treasury bill or 14%, whichever is higher. The Treasury bill rate currently is 5.99%.    Variable rates have met some resistance from consumers. Mr. Robertson of the Nilson Report says that fewer than 10% of its cardholders took one bank up on its offer to trade their low-fee, high-interest rate cards for a variable-rate card carrying a lower rate but a higher fee. &quot;People have been much more fee-sensitive than rate-sensitive,&quot; says Mr. Robertson.    But Mr. McKinley and others note that consumers who carry sizable balances on their cards are better off with variable-rate cards even though the recent increases in general interest rates point to higher variable rates in the months ahead.    &quot;There's a three percentage point gap right now between fixed-rate cards and variable-rate ones,&quot; says Mr. McKinley. &quot;Interest rates have a lot of room to rise before it's cheaper to take a fixed-rate card.&quot;    ---       RATES CHARGED BY 10 LARGEST BANK-CARD ISSUERS                                            Most                Outstanding     Number     Common     Special                  balances    of Accounts  Interest  Interest Bank          (in billions) (in millions)  Rate      Rates** Citibank          $9.10         10.0       19.8%     16.8% Bank of America    5.30          7.2       19.8 Chase Manhattan    4.50          5.0       17.5 First Chicago      3.30          3.6       19.8      16.9*   Beneficial unit  1.00          0.9       21.0* Manufacturers Hanover            2.50          3.4       17.8 MNC Financial      2.00          2.1       17.9 Wells Fargo        1.94          1.8       20.0      17.0 Chemical           1.27          2.0       19.8      19.5;                                                      16.8 Marine Midland     1.20          2.1       19.8      16.95*;   14.77* Signet             0.99          1.0       17.7   **Rates on cards with limited availability or specialconditions   *Denotes variable rate   Source: The Nilson Report</TEXT></DOC>
