For most taxpayers, the federal system is progressive, meaningit is based in large part on ability to pay, the foundation said.But state and local taxes are moderately regressive, fallingdisproportionately on those with lower incomes.   In a study released Wednesday, the nonpartisan researchorganization found great disparity in the way some taxes aredistributed among the various income levels.   ``For example, the individual income tax burden of the$90,000-or-more income group (who pay 27.4 percent of income) isnine times greater than that of a family in the lowest incomeclass,'' which pays at an effective rate of 3.1 percent, thefoundation said. The average of all income groups is about 11.4percent.   ``Conversely, the gasoline tax burden is almost 10 times greaterfor the lowest income group (1.88 percent of income) than for thehighest income families,'' which pay 0.19 percent, the reportstated. The national average is 0.71 percent.   In 1986, households under $10,000 gave just about half theirincomes _ 49.5 percent _ to federal, state and local governments.Those with incomes of $90,000 and more paid an average 51.6percent, the foundation said.   The tax burden of Americans at all income levels averaged 35.53percent in 1986 and rose slightly to 36.31 percent a year later.The figures do not take into account the massive tax overhaulenacted in 1986, but foundation economists estimated those changeshad little effect on distribution of the individual income taxburden, except to lessen the load at lowest income levels.   The foundation, whose trustees include heads of some of thenation's largest corporations, conducted the study with an eye onthe battle to cut the federal deficit. Even while that fight isbeing waged, wrote Robert C. Brown, president of the foundation,there is a continuing cry for expanding some spending programs andcreating others.   ``Fundamental to balancing these competing voices is anawareness of where public money comes from, how the burden fallsupon various income classes, and what types of taxes account forthe various income streams flowing to public coffers,'' Brownwrote. The study, he said, seeks to provide some of the answers.   The study reinforced conclusions that liberals have argued forseveral years: that the individual income tax is the mostprogressive part of the tax system while excise taxes on gasoline,cigarettes and alcohol are the most regressive.   In 1986, the average under-$10,000 family used 0.22 percent ofits income to pay the federal tax on telephone service. That taxclaimed only .05 percent of the family making between $30,000 and$40,000. Payments for social insurance _ chiefly Social Security _took 10.6 percent of the income from a family making $15,000 to$20,000 but 6.17 percent of those with incomes over $90,000.   A family with income between $10,000 and $15,000 paid 3.36 ofits income for state and local sales taxes, compared with 1.42percent for a $90,000 family.   The wealthiest families paid an effective rate of almost 38percent in federal taxes, compared with 19.9 percent for the$30,000-40,000 family. State and local taxes took almost 13.7percent from the richest and just under 16 percent from the$15,000-19,000 family.   The foundation acknowledged that the study understates total taxburdens because it is based on a very broad definition of income.For example, the rental value of the home a family owns is countedas income, as are employer-paid health insurance and pensioncontributions as well as welfare payments.   The study also assumed that all taxes, including those collectedfrom corporations, are paid by individuals.</TEXT></DOC>
