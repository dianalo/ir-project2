It depends on its great importanceto process performance and user acceptance. Advanced computerized operatoraids, e.g. in nuclear power plants, are as well as their man-machineinterface. In the Central Institute for Nuclear Research in Rossendorfa computerized operator support system for nuclear power plants is designed,which is involved in a decentralized process automation system. A similarbut simpler system, the Hierarchical Informational System (HIS) at theRossendorf Research Reactor, works with a computer controlled man-machineinterface, based on menu. In the special case of the disturbance analysisprogram SAAP-2, which is included in the HIS, the limits of menu techniquesare obviously. Therefore it seems to be necessary and with extended hard-and software possible to realize an user controlled natural languageinterface using Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods. The draft of sucha system is described. It should be able to learn during a teaching phaseall phrases and their meanings. The system will work on the basis ofa self-organizing, associative data structure. It is used to recognizea great amount of words which are used in language analysis. Error recognitionand, if possible, correction is done by means of a distance functionin the word set. Language analysis should be carried out with a simplifiedword class controlled functional analysis. With this interface it issupposed to get experience in intelligent man-machine communication toenhance operational safety in future.</TEXT></DOC>
