Jacobs.    Details of the acquisition weren't disclosed.    GATX, which has interests in rail-car leasing and management, bulk liquid terminal storage, and capital-goods leasing and financial services, said it planned to sell separately Fuller's DuroFlow Corp. and related assets of Fuller's Sutorbilt division to another party. Fuller is a Bethlehem, Pa.-based designer and maker of energy-efficient industrial equipment.    Proceeds of the sales will be used to pay down debt from GATX's recent stock buyback, the company said. In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely with borrowed funds that are repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or through asset sales. </TEXT></DOC>
