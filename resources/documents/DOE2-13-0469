Basic physical, chemicaland biochemical parameters were analyzed to establish the rate of SO2/NOxabsorption by the culture medium. It was shown that the pH remains constantfor 24 h of exposure to gas concentrations up to 50 p.p.m. The concentrationof ions resulting from absorption of each pollutant in the liquid phaseis dependent on their concentration in the gas phase and on exposuretime. Short exposure times and high gas dosages resulted in similar dosesin the medium as long exposure periods and low gas dosages. The activitiesof a human serum standard (alkaline phosphatase, ALP; aspartate aminotransferase, AST; alanine amino transferase, ALT; gamma-glutamyltransferase,gamma-GT; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH) were determined after gaseous exposureto SO2 and NOx. The results revealed a distinct decrease in the activityof LDH after 1, 3 and 5 h exposure to 200 p.p.m. SO2. The effects ofthe pollutants were assayed in vitro using fetal hamster lung cells (FHLC),rat hepatocytes and the cell line CO60. For the determination of toxiceffects, it was shown that the plating efficiency was a more sensitiveparameter than the assay for trypan blue exclusion. Toxicity indicatedas an increase of LDH leakage was not observed from FHLC in culture.Instead, a decrease of LDH was found following SO2 exposition. This decreasewas similar to that observed for the human serum standard. The inductionof DNA single-strand breaks was determined as a measure of genotoxiceffects. SO2 application decreased the rate of DNA single-strand breaksinduced by N-nitroso-acetoxymethyl-methylamine in both FHLC and in rathepatocytes.</TEXT></DOC>
