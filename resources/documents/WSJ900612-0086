After that, he says, they let him run only companieswith serious problems.   But even that experience hardly prepared him for hissituation today, as managing director of Jawa.</LP><TEXT>   Once a world-class manufacturer of motorcycles, Jawacertainly qualifies as a company with serious problems.Compared with those made in Japan and the West, itsmotorcycles are obsolete. Its physical plant is decrepit. Itsworkers and managers are woefully unprepared for the comingswitch to free-market methods. And its main customer -- theSoviet Union, which caused many of these problems in thefirst place -- can no longer be depended upon to buy itsproducts.   &quot;Without a substantial financial injection, we cannotstand on our feet anymore,&quot; Mr. Cernohorsky says.   Jawa's problems mirror those of all Czechoslovak industry,which First Deputy Prime Minister Valtr Komarek describes asbeing &quot;systematically devastated&quot; over the past 40 years,leaving it uncompetitive and technologically backward. Now,the fates of countless companies, including Jawa, are aboutto be decided by their managements, foreign investors and anew national government.   While the nation's first free elections in 44 years thispast weekend capped the political revolution that unseatedthe Communist government last November, Czechoslovakia'seconomic revolution is just about to begin in earnest. Thewinners of the election, Civic Forum and its Slovakaffiliate, Public Against Violence, will head a coalitiongovernment that is expected to significantly speed uptransformation to a free-market economy.   &quot;Basic changes haven't been performed up to now&quot; to createa new economic system, notes Zdenek Tuma of the PrognosticsInstitute, the think tank that has provided much of thegovernment's economic leadership. The new government isexpected to act soon to break up monopolies, beginprivatizing state companies, and liberalize rules on foreigninvestment. Even the most optimistic leaders concede thechanges will cost tens of thousands of people their jobs.   The problem, says a research director for a computer-partsmaker, is that by Western standards there are too manyworkers for too little production. And output is decliningfurther in the face of collapsing sales to the Soviet Unionand other Eastern European countries.   The research director, speaking on condition that he andhis company not be identified, says potential Westernpartners are brought to his factory at lunch time so theywon't see that &quot;people are accustomed to not working veryhard.&quot; He predicts that &quot;at least half our (2,500) employeesmust be unemployed within half a year.&quot;   Workers know drastic changes are coming, &quot;but no one wantsto believe this,&quot; the director says. &quot;Everyone wants to thinkthere will come some miracle.&quot;   For Jawa, the miracle would be a joint venture with aforeign manufacturer. A less desirable alternative, if thegovernment allows it, would be to give up majority controland produce motorcycles for a foreign investor.   Japan's four big motorcycle manufacturers -- Honda MotorCo., Yamaha Motor Co., Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. andSuzuki Motor Co. -- have visited Brodce. While the visitswere just &quot;first contacts,&quot; Mr. Cernohorsky says, thecompanies appeared serious because they want to manufacturecloser to their European market.   Meanwhile, Jawa, whose motorcycles were once prized byaficionados around Europe and in the U.S., struggles tosurvive. The 52-year-old Mr. Cernohorsky shows visitors abrochure advertising Jawa's model TS350 motorcycle. Whenasked what other models Jawa makes, he shakes his head andsays that, apart from about 1,000 racing machines Jawa makesa year, the TS350 is the entire line.   &quot;This is the disaster,&quot; he says, adding that there is onlyone street model &quot;because that is what the Soviets wanted.&quot;The TS350 is powered by a two-stroke engine designed morethan 30 years ago and doesn't meet emission and othertechnical standards of some Western countries. But it ischeap and easy to repair.   More than 70% of the 100,000 motorcycles Jawa has producedannually went to the Soviet Union and Poland. Owing to Sovietand Polish economic problems, and to the Czechoslovakrevaluation of its crown against the ruble, these markets arelikely to shrink, with few if any buyers elsewhere in theworld to take their place.   Despite the TS350's low price in West Germany -- 3,600Deutsche marks ($2,120), compared with about DM6,000 ($3,540)for a Western model of similar size -- Jawa sells fewer than100 motorcycles there. As with most Czechoslovak industry,Mr. Cernohorsky says, the problem is quality. And this, hecontends, is the heritage of an official Communist program ofthe 1950s referred to as &quot;the big shovel,&quot; which emphasizedquantity over quality.   That wasn't the corporate philosophy back in 1929, whenJawa was founded by engineer and designer Frantisek Janecek.Mr. Janecek originally got his start by producing theGerman-designed Wanderer motorcycle under license, but hesoon established Jawa's own identity by producing low-costvehicles with innovative designs.   Today, Jawa plans to develop two new models for theWestern European market by 1993, Mr. Cernohorsky says. To dothat, he will need help. What Jawa can offer a foreignmanufacturer, besides a skilled work force, is access toabout 37 acres of land it owns. Restrictions on foreignownership of land are unlikely to be lifted anytime soon, buta venture with Jawa potentially could offer such access.   Mr. Cernohorsky concedes time is running out and, if thegovernment permits foreign ownership, Jawa might lose itsindependence. &quot;In a month's time,&quot; he says, &quot;it's possiblethat this will be the only choice.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
