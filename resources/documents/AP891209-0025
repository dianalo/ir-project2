Two radio stations that cater to Colombians have scheduledrallies today for Miami officer William Lozano, convicted Thursdayon two counts of manslaughter in the January deaths of ClementLloyd and Allan Blanchard.   Lozano, who remains suspended from the force with full paypending a police department hearing, echoed feelings among Miami'sHispanics that he was convicted in order to avoid further riotingby Miami's blacks.   ``I don't think it was fair,'' said Lozano, 31. You have torealize (there have been) a lot of problems in the community in thepast. I was just being used as a scapegoat for this.''   Lozano also said he knew the verdict would be guilty as soon asthe six-member jury entered the courtroom Thursday.   ``Because when the jurors came out, everyone, every singleperson from the jurors, they were looking down,'' he said. ``Theywere sad, and you can read in their eyes that nobody wanted it. AndI knew, right there and then.''   Three days of racial disturbances ensued in the Liberty City andOvertown neighborhoods after the shooting of Lloyd, 23. Blanchard,24, suffered fatal injuries in the crash of the motorcycle thatLloyd was driving. The two were fleeing another group of police.   Rioting also followed trials in the past where white officerswere acquitted in the slayings of blacks. But all was quiet Fridayin the black neighborhoods.   Leaders of the black community praised Lozano's guilty verdictas a victory for justice, but many Hispanics, including the200,000-strong Colombian community, have said the officer wasshortchanged by racial politics.   ``We are deeply hurt,'' Hernando Torres, executive secretary ofthe Colombian American Political Action Committee, said Friday.``We are convinced that officer Lozano was doing his duty defendingthe community.''   The two radio stations organizing the rally, WOCN-AM andWKAT-AM, said they would seek money for Lozano's expected appealand signatures for a petition asking Dade Circuit Judge JosephFarina to show leniency in Lozano's Jan. 24 sentencing.   On Friday, Jewish, Protestant and lay religious leaders held ajoint news conference and declared a weekend of prayer for theshooting victims's families and for Lozano's family.   ``Our prayers should be directed at preserving the unity of ourcommunity within which the opinions are as diverse as ourpopulation,'' said Rabbi Solomon Schiff, chairman of Dade County'sCommunity Relations Board. ``I think the worst thing we can do as acommunity is to sit back smugly and say we came through this timewithout fires and riots.''   Lozano's family issued radio appeals earlier in the day for morelegal funds.   ``We need money urgently,'' Lozano's brother Jairo, a Miamipolice officer, told listeners on WKAT. ``I couldn't sleep allnight worrying about it.''   ``It seems like things are better off here for a drug traffickerthan for a police officer _ maybe it would have been better for usthat way,'' he said.   William Lozano's brother, Windsor, and his wife, Ana, also areMiami police officers.</TEXT></DOC>
