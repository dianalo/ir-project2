Based on Borden Chemicals' closing price of $19.375 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, the stake has an indicated value of about $167 million.    R.J. Ventres, chairman and chief executive officer of Borden Inc., said selling the interest &quot;would generate cash for Borden to invest in its six strategic growth areas.&quot;    Separately, Borden Chemicals reported net income of $33.6 million for the third quarter ended Sept. 23, on revenue of $141.5 million. After the general partner's interest, per-unit net was 90 cents.    In its initial public offering in late 1987, Borden Chemicals units were sold at $10 each.    Borden produces packaged foods, nonfood consumer products and chemical specialties. Sales in 1988 are projected to total $7.5 billion.    (Revised WSJ Oct. 20, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
