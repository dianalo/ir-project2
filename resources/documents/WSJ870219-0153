All the more so if you forsake the snug warmth of a heated cabin for the bone-chilling cold of the open bow.    Out-of-towners do it, though. And one Saturday, I do it. It gets so cold that I break the boat. But more of that later.    The temperature-and-time sign overlooking the harbor from Brooklyn reads 16 degrees, but with winds up to 20 miles an hour it feels more like 15 below. The icy residue from an earlier eight-inch snowfall makes walking hazardous. It is the kind of day that sends peddlers and three-card monte dealers fleeing the city's streets. Thoroughbred racing is canceled at Aqueduct because it isn't a fit day for jockeys or horses.    Yet on the ice-crusted bow of the Seaport Line's De Witt Clinton stands Maggie Schuss, a 48-year-old Cuban native now of Miami, who has come north for the cold. Taking in the harbor-side view of the New York skyline, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, she explains: &quot;Northerners go south to be warm in the winter. This is the equivalent. We have enough heat at home.&quot; Her husband, William, 50, laconically agrees. &quot;It's a change,&quot; he says with a shrug.    There are only 47 of us paying passengers on this 90-minute cruise aboard the vessel, a 150-foot boat certified to carry 631 people. Forty of the passengers belong to a tour group from Sweden. It is a commendable turnout for a winter's day. On Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, there were only seven passengers aboard the 1 p.m. trip. The 3 p.m. voyage was canceled: No one showed up to brave the cold and the rain. On some trips, only two passengers have sailed -- along with a captain, an engineer, two deckhands, a tour narrator and a combination boat manager-ticket taker-bartender-porter to cater to their needs.    From March to December, the De Witt Clinton and its smaller sister, the paddlewheeler Andrew Fletcher, offer a daily schedule of harbor cruises, often filled to capacity, from the South Street Seaport on Manhattan's lower tip. The Fletcher prudently went south to Miami for winter cruises. The Clinton stayed in New York, making twice-daily trips on weekends and holidays. Winter rates are what the traffic will bear: $4 for adults and $2 for children, about half the regular fare.    Dan Pursel, the 40-year-old, Brooklyn-born skipper of the Clinton since it was built last year, says he prefers the winter's &quot;relaxed atmosphere.&quot; Summer cruises with 600 passengers &quot;can be a madhouse,&quot; he says. Scott Hansen, a 24-year-old engineer from the Bronx, agrees. Later, Capt. Pursel's enthusiasm seems to chill. After digging out the passenger gangway from a mound of frozen snow, he mutters, &quot;You've got to be crazy to go out in weather like this.&quot;    There is nothing easy about running a cruise boat in winter. It takes boiling water to thaw the frozen lines at the Clinton's overnight berth so that the boat can be brought around to the passenger pier. Nancy Pucci, a 23-year-old deckhand from Tenafly, N.J., bundles up for her chores in two pairs of long johns, three tops and a quilted coverall. But she could use a pair of spikes to help her navigate the icy deck. Three times she tries to throw a dock line to the pier. Three times it falls short in the water because, she says, she can't get the traction she needs to make a proper heave.    The morning has already claimed one casualty. Robert Deme, the other deckhand, slipped on the ice before the Clinton set sail and has gone ashore to seek medical help for a rapidly swelling leg.    &quot;All the elements are against us,&quot; says Capt. Pursel. Besides the cold and wind, there is a 3.5-knot tidal current. But at least the sun is shining. By 1 p.m., the ship is made safe and ready, and passengers start coming aboard.    &quot;It's warm for Nebraska, but it's still freezing,&quot; says Kelle Hunt, 20, of Lincoln, Neb., as she hurries up the gangway and makes a beeline for the warmth of the Grand Saloon. Yet she and her friend Bonnie Workman, 23, of Payette, Idaho, are soon out on the open bow, savoring the sights with camera at hand. The two have come east to work au pair for families in New Jersey.    Richard Ferrante, 24, who recently moved north from Florida, has only one question when he and a companion, Mary Cadigan, 24, of Rahway, N.J., spot the Clinton at the pier. &quot;Is there a bar aboard?&quot; he asks Paul Richards, the boat manager, who assures him there is. &quot;That sounds good to me,&quot; Mr. Ferrante says, trotting off to buy tickets.    Once aboard, he and Miss Cadigan venture out onto the deck as the boat plies past the Battery toward the Statue of Liberty. Within minutes, though, both are huddled in the saloon, where they fortify themselves with cocoa braced with shots of coffee liqueur. &quot;It got a little too cold,&quot; Miss Cadigan says.    The Swedish sightseers, sent on a U.S. tour for winning a sales-incentive contest at the Storno radio group of Goteborg, insist the weather is just fine. &quot;It's quite warm,&quot; says Torkel Maanhede, 28. &quot;We should be wearing Bermuda shorts.&quot; Temperatures at home sank to eight degrees below zero just before he left, he says. Still, most of his tour mates stay inside. They run up a $208 bar tab.    As for me, I play the stoical old salt, braving the cold of the bow and climbing to the port-side command station outside the pilot house to watch the captain maneuver the Clinton in and out of the dock. Face to the wind, I can almost imagine myself the master of my own oceangoing vessel.    Capt. Pursel interrupts my reverie. &quot;Pull the whistle,&quot; he commands, pointing to the brass air-powered signal mounted high on the vessel's stack. &quot;Give it a prolonged blow.&quot;    Proudly, I give the green line a tug. It's frozen, though, and there's nary a toot. I pull it again, harder. To my horror, I realize I have pulled too hard. Down comes the green line as the great whistle blares forth, a shrill torrent of sound that won't stop. A chunk of ice that was blocking the whistle now prevents it from turning off, I'm told. Only the heat of a blow torch and a hair dryer can stop the rush of air.    Capt. Pursel tells me not to worry; in winter, such things happen, he says. But I doubt that I'll ever get the chance to pull the whistle again. </TEXT></DOC>
