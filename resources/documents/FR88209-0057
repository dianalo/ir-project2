Applicant states that this application has been filed in response to theCommission's ``Notice Inviting Applications To Provide New Gas ServiceTo The Northeast U.S.'' issued on July 24, 1987, and ``Order Granting Rehearing''issued on September 25, 1987, in Docket No. CP87-451-000, which declaredan ``Open Season'' for filing new applications to provide natural gas serviceto the Northeastern United States. Applicant proposes to construct a pipeline system capable of deliveringup to 500 MMcf per day from both United States and Canadian sources. Applicant'ssystem would consist of two major segments: (1) 285 miles of 30-inch O.D.pipeline extending from an interconnection with ANR's Defiance CompressorStation, located in Defiance County, Ohio, to a terminal point in WestmorelandCounty, Pennsylvania, and two 12,000 horsepower compressor stations; and(2) 76 miles of 24-inch O.D. pipeline from Richmond County, Staten Island,New York to Suffolk County, Long Island, New York. As is more fully explained in the filing, Applicant's facilities wouldbe able to interconnect with the existing facilities of Texas Eastern TransmissionCorporation (TETCO) in the Westmoreland, Pennsylvania, area. From thispoint, Applicant avers, the natural gas could be transported by TETCO toa point of interconnection with Algonquin Gas Transmission Company (Algonquin)near Lambertville, New Jersey, with Algonquin then transporting a portionof the gas for ultimate consumption in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.The remainder of the gas, Applicant continues, could be transported toNew Jersey and New York through facilities of TETCO and Applicant. Applicantstates that while some information specific to transportation by TETCOand Algonquin has been provided in the instant filing, the use of any ofa number of existing systems or combinations thereof could be used to transportnatural gas to the Northeast in conjunction with Applicant's proposed system.However, Applicant does not state that any filing to assist in its proposedtransportation of natural gas has been, or will in the future be made byTETCO, Algonquin or any other pipeline company. Applicant states that the proposed facilities are estimated to cost $288million and that the facilities have been designed to deliver up to 500MMcf per day on a firm basis. Applicant states that it also proposes toprovide interruptible transportation service to the extent capacity isavailable. Applicant explains that the facility costs will be capitalizedwith 75% debt and 25% equity. Applicant proposes to utilize the pipeline systems of Great Lakes TransmissionCompany and ANR for the transportation of natural gas from sources in theUnited States and Canada to Defiance, Ohio. Applicant explains that transportationcontracts would be entered into with willing shippers under individualsection 7 arrangements or under the self-implementing provisions of section311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, as may be appropriate. Applicantreports that the proposed rates included in Exhibit P of the applicationhave been designed on a modified fixed variable basis, and that maximumand minimum rates are provided for under both the firm and interruptiblerate schedules which reflect the length of haul. In its description of filed Exhibit F-IV, Statement Concerning the Requirementsof the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Applicant states thatit would supplement at some future time its environmental report to cover:(1) Changes in the location and size of compressor units in Ohio; (2) the68 mile pipeline segment from Lawrence County, Pennsylvania to WestmorelandCounty, Pennsylvania; and (3) the 76 mile pipeline segment from RichmondCounty, Staten Island, New York to Suffolk County, Long Island New York.This statement indicates that the instant filing does not contain a completeenvironmental assessment report on the Applicant's proposed pipeline construction.It is noted that Applicant filed this application within the time-frameof the open season announced by the Commission in Docket No. CP87-451-000,concerning projects to supply natural gas to the Northeast U.S. <T3>Comment date: </T3>February 24, 1988, in accordance with Standard ParagraphF at the end of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">8.
