Others blithely sail into port witha hold full of liquid hashish, or dissolve their illicit cargo inwindshield wiper fluid.   Whether the methods are obvious or ingenious, most drugsmugglers in Canada are evading detection, say law enforcementagencies.   Only a fraction of the 90 million travelers who entered Canadalast year were checked for narcotics and few drug shipments wereintercepted, said Arthur Lewis, head of enforcement at CanadaCustoms.   ``I've seen estimates as low as 5 percent,'' he said. ``We'renot naive enough to think we're going to stop it.''   Vast empty spaces and a 5,335-mile border with the United Statesmake Canada an easy touch for drug traffic in both directions.   ``They're trying to move further and further north because of(law enforcement) pressure in Florida and so little patrolcapability here,'' said Lewis.   Authorities rule out a U.S.-style ``zero tolerance'' blitz atthe border because of concern for constitutional rights.   ``I don't think our country would tolerate it,'' said DetectiveInspector Gerry Hawke of Ontario Provincial Police.   Canadian enforcers did seize 40 tons of illicit drugs last yearand nab more than 10,000 people for drug offenses. Customs agentsexpect to confiscate drugs worth $330 million this year, a tenfoldincrease since 1982.   Large-volume traffickers use sealed ship containers and trailertrucks, knowing that police cannot possibly check them all.   ``Trailers are lined up at all the bridges from the U.S. and weknow a fair amount of drugs are coming in this way. But we can'task them all to unload,'' said Hawke.   Drugs were also found in a baby's diapers, jade figurines, apiano, the tubing of a luggage cart, scuba tanks, sacks of coffee,in the lining of running shoes, car windshield wiper fluid and atruck's hydraulic system, officers said. One hardened cocainesolution was disguised as a shipment of ponchos.   A trawler was seized at Vancouver in British Columbia with eighttons of marijuana from Thailand, and a woman and her son werejailed for attempting to import $1.6 million worth of Columbiancocaine in 3.5-ounce packages sent registered mail.   ``Swallowers and stuffers'' concealing drugs on their person arethe bane of airport security, said Inspector Neil Pouliot of theRoyal Canadian Mounted Police. A chief method is to swallow condomsfilled with cocaine.   Thorough body searches are increasing. ``There is no moral codewhen you're dealing with narcotics. Everything is fair game,'' saidCustoms inspector Michael Crichton.   U.S. customs officers at Niagara Falls found $75 million worthof heroin in the false bottom of a suitcase two Vietnamese-borncouriers were taking to New York. Police in Regina in Saskatchewandiscovered a basement lined with aluminum foil where a forest ofmarijuana was growing hydroponically under 5,000 watt lightbulbsand an automatic watering system.   Neither Canada Customs nor the Mounted Police even attempt topatrol the Great Lakes, an open invitation to drug merchants. ``Werely on inside information so we can be there to meet them,'' saidLewis.   His problem is that Customs has just 197 drug officersnationwide, aided by 32 dog teams sniffing baggage and cargo atports of entry. The Mounties deploy 1,100 drug enforcers, including27 liaison officers at Canadian embassies from Thailand to Jamaicaand one each in Miami, Fla., New York and Los Angeles.   The country's combined anti-narcotics force of 1,500concentrates on suppliers, not users. Even with major busts, streetprices declined last year as the flow continued.   The Mounties estimate the drug trade in Canada is now worth $8.3billion a year, while their budget to combat the scourge is lessthan $83 million.   ``The market is expanding, there's no doubt about that,'' saidthe Mounties' assistant commissioner, Marcel Coutu. ``We could do abetter job if we had more money and more people.''   Drug offenses also rose 9 percent last year; Montreal police sayhalf the crime in the city is now drug-related. Marijuana remainsthe most popular drug, while Canada has about 500,000 cocaine users_ compared to an estimated 12 million in the United States. Crackuse is not widespread.   Soviet customs agents helped with the best tip of the year. Theytold the Mounties that a drug ring planned to ship 11,277 pounds ofhashish from Kabul, Afghanistan, through Leningrad to Montreal. Thehash was seized on arrival and three Canadians are now behind bars.   Ontario police hope a proposed new law will enable them tofreeze the proceeds of drug trafficking when an arrest is made.Unlike U.S. legislation, however, the seized assets would not beearmarked to fight drugs.   The Italian Mafia, Chinese triads, Iranian, Pakistani and othercriminal organizations control the heroin market, while Colombiancrime families are flooding Canada with cocaine, according to theMounted Police. Other drugs are imported by Vietnamese gangs inVancouver, motorcycle gangs such as the Hell's Angels and Satan'sChoice, and traffickers from Jamaica and Lebanon.   The foot soldiers in trafficking, or ``mules,'' are ordinarypeople recruited for cash, as a Jamaican immigrant in Torontorecently disclosed.   She told The Toronto Star she earned $16,600 bringing threesuitcases stuffed with 150 pounds of marijuana back from Kingston.She sailed through customs by traveling with her husband and threeyoung sons and pretending to be vacationers.   ``The whole scam is so easy it's ridiculous,'' the 35-year-oldwoman said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thu AMs, Aug. 18</NOTE></DOC>
