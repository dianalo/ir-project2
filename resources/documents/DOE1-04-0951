Experimentalresults obtained by combustion calorimetry using small amount of substance(5mg) give the enthalpy of combustion of a compound in the solid statewith an accuracy better than 0.1%. Four molecules: fluorene, carbazole,dibenzofuran and dibenzothiophene are studied to find a relationshipbetween energy values and structure. From experimental results and theoreticalcalculations, it was possible to determine for the four molecules resonanceenergies, enthalpies of atomization, the relative stability and the correlationbetween chemical bonds and their energy values. 34 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
