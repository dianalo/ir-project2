MickeyLeland and 15 others who died when their plane slammed into aremote southwestern mountain.   Heavy clouds and rain twice forced two Blackhawk helicopterswith U.S. and Ethiopian personnel to return to the capital beforethe weather cleared enough for them to make the 250-mile flight tothe crash site by midafternoon.   However, it was too late to begin full-scale recovery operationsby then, said James Haley, chief spokesman for the U.S. Embassy.   ``We've got people down there and have started taking thenecessary photographs,'' said Haley. ``But we won't beginretrieving bodies until tomorrow.''   The bodies of 12 victims, including the Texas Democrat, werefound Sunday in the wreckage of the twin-engine plane, whichdisappeared Aug. 7 on a flight to a refugee camp near the Sudaneseborder.   Three others who had been on board were presumed dead in thecrash that one U.S. Air Force pilot described as ``awesome,unsurvivable.'' Workers were searching for the missing bodies in aravine below a jagged cliff at the crash site west-southwest of thecapital.   ``The nose of the plane just ran into rocks,'' said Rep. GaryAckerman, D-N.Y., who was in the helicopter that first spotted thewreckage of his colleague, who was chairman of the House SelectCommittee on Hunger.   ``The wings sheared off, and the engine and fuselage wereburned,'' Ackerman said after returning to Washington late Sunday.   The cause of the crash was not known, but the weather was cloudyand visibility was poor when Leland and his party left Addis Ababa.Bad weather had delayed their takeoff by two hours.   Flags were lowered to half-staff at the White House whilePresident Bush and other leaders expressed sorrow at the death ofLeland, who was en route to inspect conditions of 300,000 Sudanesecivil war refugees at a camp in Fugnido, about 100 miles southwestof the crash site.   The Twin Otter aircraft, owned by Ethiopia's relief agency,crashed 4,300 feet up the side of the 5,500-foot mountain.   The bodies were to be flown to nearby Dembidola and then ferriedby a C-130 cargo plane to the capital.   Haley said the two Blackhawk helicopters would stay overnight atGambela, about 34 miles southeast of the crash site and beginsalvaging efforts at daybreak. They were expected to be joined bytwo more Blackhawk helicopters carrying additional rescue crews inthe morning.   About 100 recovery personnel were sent to the site today.   Two C-130s carrying helicopter fuel also will leave for the siteat first light, said Haley.   The bodies of the Americans were expected to be flown back tothe United States later this week aboard a C-141 hospital plane,according to an administration official in Washington.   Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Stan Bloyer said in Washingon thatLeland's plane did not appear to be attempting an emergency landingwhen it crashed. He said it ``basically disintegrated'' afterhitting the side of the mountain, apparently at cruise speed.   The wreckage was in terrain so rugged that medical teams,including two doctors, had to be initially lowered to the site fromhelicopters, said Haley.   The bodies of the nine Americans were to be flown home viaTorrejon Air Base outside Madrid, Spain. Seven Ethiopians were alsoon board.   Leland's party consisted of two staff members; an aide to Rep.Ronald V. Dellums, D-Calif.; a friend of the congressman; threeofficers of the U.S. Agency for International Development; and thewife of one AID official. The Ethiopians included a U.S. Embassyemployee, three government officials and a crew of three.   Mourned as a fighter for the homeless and hungry worldwide,Leland was a six-term representative from Houston who began hispolitical career as a firebrand militant but won the respect ofboth liberals and conservatives.   Bush said in a statement from the White House, ``Mickey Lelandand the other members of his traveling party, both Americans andEthiopians, were engaged in a noble cause _ trying to feed thehungry.''   Leland often said his commitment to ending hunger was rooted ina trip he made to Sudan in 1984, when a starving young girl diedbefore his eyes at a refugee camp. ``Every day I see her face,'' hetold reporters.   The trip that ended with his death was his second there sinceMarch; he visited Ethiopia and Sudan six times in the 10 years heserved in Congress. He was elected to fill the seat vacated byBarbara Jordan when she retired.   In Houston, friends and colleagues of Leland streamed into hisoffice as news spread the wreckage had been discovered.   Rep. Mike Andrews, a Houston Democrat, said in a breaking voice,``This is a very difficult time for Houston. We have lost one ofour most important leaders, and I've lost a very good friend.''   Texas Gov. Bill Clements must decide whether to call a specialelection in November or sooner to fill the downtown Houstondistrict seat Leland held.</TEXT></DOC>
