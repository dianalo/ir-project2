SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The stifling heat baking much of Americathreatens more than crops, weather experts warn. Heat kills peopletoo.   The 1980 heat wave claimed the lives of an estimated 1,265Americans, according to an analysis prepared for the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Many of the victims wereelderly and poor, living in homes or apartments that lacked airconditioning.   Hot weather places greater stress on the heart and bloodvessels, warns the Department of Health and Human Services. Thus,when temperatures rise, so do the number of heart attacks andstrokes.   And high humidity just makes it worse, by interfering with thebody's ability to cool itself.   The human body is cooled by evaporation of sweat and bycirculating blood closer to the skin to allow the heat to dissipate.   The problem is that when the air temperature gets close to thebody's 98.6 degree Fahrenheit normal, heat doesn't dissipateoutward as readily.   Sweating does nothing to cool the body unless the moisture isremoved by evaporation into the air, and humid air isn't as willingto accept that liquid as is dry air.   As the body tries to cope with increasing heat it begins pumpinga torrent of blood through the dilated circulatory system, whilethe sweat glands pour out liquid, including dissolved chemicalsthat the body may need.   What follows can be a heat-related illness when the body can nolonger shed enough heat to keep its temperature near normal levels,or when it can not cope with loss of liquid and chemicals. Theseillnesses include heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heatstroke.   Heat cramps are painful spasms, often occurring in the musclesof the legs and abdomen. NOAA experts in weather and healthrecommend firm pressure on the cramping muscle followed by gentlemassage. Give the victim water to drink.   Heat exhaustion, they point out, is more serious. Symptomsinclude heavy sweating, weakness; cold, pale, clammy skin. Thevictim may faint or vomit.   Treatment includes getting the victim out of the sun to a placewhere they can lie down and loosen their clothing. Get them to afan or air conditioned area if possible, and apply cool, wetcloths. Give water to drink. If vomiting continues, seek medicalattention.   The most dangerous condition is heat stroke, also known assunstroke. In this case the body temperature can rise to dangerouslevels, skin is hot and dry, pulse rapid and the victim may becomeunconscious.   Heat stroke is a severe emergency; summon medical assistance orget the victim to a hospital, NOAA warns. Delay can be fatal.   While waiting for help, get the victim to a cooler environment,use fans or air conditioner and cool sponging, but do not givefluids, the agency says.   Here is a list of summertime suggestions from NOAA aimed atpreventing heat-related illnesses:   _Slow down. Strenuous activities should be reduced, eliminatedor rescheduled to the coolest time of the day.   _Dress for summer. Lightweight, light-colored clothing reflectsheat and sunlight and helps maintain normal body temperature.   _Eat less. Foods like proteins increase metabolic heatproduction and also induce more water loss.   _Drink plenty of water. Your body needs water to keep cool, sodrink plenty of fluids even if you don't feel thirsty, but avoid orreduce use of alcoholic beverages. Persons with fluid restrictionsor with epilepsy, heart, kidney or liver disease should consulttheir doctor.   _Do not take salt tablets unless directed by a physician.   _Do not get too much sun. Sunburn reduces the skin's efficiencyat cooling the body.   _Spend time in air conditioned places. If you cannot afford homeair conditioning, spend some time in another air conditionedenvironment such as a shopping center or other commercial building.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for AMs Wed June 29</NOTE></DOC>
