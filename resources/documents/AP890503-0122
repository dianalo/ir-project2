(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Desperate times call for desperate measuresin the Oral Roberts ministry as the elder statesman of televisionevangelism struggles to raise more than $4 million by Saturday tosave his religious empire.   Roberts said in late March he had five weeks to raise $11million to pay past-due bills or creditors would ``startdismantling'' the ministry. Richard Roberts, the evangelist's son,said more than $4 million still is needed by Saturday, when OralRoberts University graduates nearly 1,000 of its 4,300 students.   Roberts announced Tuesday he was pulling the university'sathletic teams out of NCAA competition and applying for admissionin the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics to savemoney. He estimated that would save $500,000 to $1 million a year.   Roberts, who once said nationally ranked NCAA teams could helpshowcase his evangelical university, said the decision was anindication to supporters of the sacrifices necessary to save theministry.   ``When they see that I've made this painful decision, I thinkthey will realize how serious our problem is and will comethrough,'' he told the Tulsa World.   The decision, effective immediately, ended the chances ofpost-season tournament play for the university's 36-18 baseballteam, which had hopes of a regional playoff bid with six games leftin the season.   ``To work that long and that hard and to have an outside forcecome in and take it away from you, that's hard,'' said Brett Louis,a sophomore catcher and designated hitter.   ``We've been facing the worst financial crisis in the history ofthis ministry,'' Richard Roberts said. ``We're not out here inTulsa crying wolf. We've got a sincere problem.''   There have been other financial crises that forced cutbacks.   Roberts dropped the university's law school in 1985 and dentalschool in 1986, and turned over the City of Faith Medical Center'sclinic operation to an independent doctor's group in 1987. Lastyear the ministry took its television programs off 125 stations andthe university scaled down an $8 million scholarship program formedical students.   ``Everybody misses one large point,'' said Mark Swadener, chieffinancial officer for the ministry. ``They think we like to raisemoney. It is absolutely the opposite. We don't like to come to youand ask for money. We don't like to come to you because we don'twant to be your problem. We want to be your solution.''   Roberts blames the well-publicized sins of fellow evangelistsJim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart for his ministry's woes. Citing a``spirit of skepticism'' that has discouraged the once-faithful,Roberts claims donations have tumbled steadily since the 1987scandal involving Bakker and his PTL ministry from $5 million amonth to $2.7 million.   But Roberts has had his share of controversy in his 41-year-oldministry, including claims of seeing a 900-foot Jesus, wrestlingmatches with the devil and a life-or-death ultimatum from God toraise $8 million for the medical school scholarship program in 1987.   Nevertheless, the 71-year-old tent preacher who pioneeredtelevision evangelism says he is willing to pay any price to bringsupporters back to his ministry.   ``This is an awful thing for me to say, but I'd be willing tolose my soul, I believe, to save Oral Roberts University,'' he said.   Roberts, who built his $500 million evangelical kingdom on thecredo ``Expect A Miracle,'' has managed to meet the challenge morethan once in the last several years.   He has raised more than $20 million in special appeals since1986, including his controversial $8 million fund raiser that endedin March 1987 after he said God would ``call me home'' if he failed.   Richard Roberts said he believes the ministry will raise themoney it needs and he still plans to leave for the Soviet Unionnext week on a six-day trip. ``I refuse to give up. I refuse toturn loose,'' he said. ``I'm expecting a miracle for ORU.''</TEXT></DOC>
