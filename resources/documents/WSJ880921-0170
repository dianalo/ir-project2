In the multimillion-dollar mainframe and minicomputer market, the problems and the perquisites are magnified.    Jansen Ek, Shanghai manager of Hewlett-Packard Co. in China, thought he had clinched a minicomputer sale to the China National Rice Institute by arranging a three-month U.S. visa for an institute official. But according to Mr. Ek, Groupe Bull of France, a joint venture of Honeywell Inc. of the U.S. and France's Compagnie des Machines Bull, clinched the deal instead by promising to send three institute officials to Paris for a year of training.    &quot;How can I compete?&quot; he asks. Groupe Bull declines to discuss the details of its training program.    Despite indications that computer imports will recover after two years of sharp decline, China's market remains relatively small and volatile. A shortage of foreign exchange has sharply reduced purchases. And what few sales there are typically take 12 to 18 months to negotiate, industry executives say.    International Data Corp. (China), a Hong Kong unit of the U.S. research firm, says China's purchases of foreign computers last year amounted to $470 million, down 36% from 1986 and 60% from 1985, when sales peaked. China imported 451 minicomputers and mainframes last year, compared with 745 in 1985.    Companies with a big staff in China find themselves squeezed between high operating costs and shrinking business. International Business Machines Corp. and rival Digital Equipment Corp. have scaled down their Shanghai operations. Honeywell Bull Inc., a Minneapolis-based company partly owned by Groupe Bull and Honeywell, has moved its China operations from Beijing to Hong Kong.    Yet the vendors see reasons for renewed optimism about the China market. Foreign-exchange reserves have risen to $18 billion from a low of $10.6 billion in 1985, sparking hope that Beijing will relax import controls. In addition, Beijing's spending on computers lags far behind the $14 billion to $18 billion projected for the current five-year plan, which began in 1986, so some vendors expect sales to pick up in the plan's remaining years.    That hasn't happened yet, but, says Cho Wong, marketing manager for Digital's China unit, based in Hong Kong, &quot;We're expecting to see heavier buying.&quot; For 1988-90, International Data predicts 8% annual growth, compared with China's official forecast of 12% annually.    The reasons the Chinese buy computers aren't typical of the industry, and among them, need often comes last. Higher on the list might be such concerns as: Does the buyer have hard currency, or does a rival ministry have a superior computer?    Personal benefits also come into play. Digital and Unisys Corp. of the U.S. were the finalists in bidding in June for a $5 million mainframe system. The buyer, the Ministry of Aeronautics and Astronautics Industry, wasn't satisfied with test results the companies supplied and insisted on visiting the U.S. for on-the-spot tests. &quot;The Chinese official handed us an itinerary of the cities he wanted to visit, blocking out the days he had planned to meet his children in the U.S.,&quot; says an executive of one of the companies. The companies grudgingly agreed to share the cost. Guanxi, or personal relationships, is an important element in winning a bid. Computer executives cultivate personal relationships for business reasons in many countries. But in China, politics has a way of changing the rules and the players. An example is the merging of two ministries in March to form the Ministry of Electronics Industry and the formation of a Commission of Machine Building Industry to control computer imports.    &quot;We're all rushing to rebuild our ties with ministry officials,&quot; a U.S. computer executive says. &quot;You don't know what would happen if you aren't the first to entertain them when they come in.&quot;    Joint ventures illustrate the lengths to which some computer concerns are willing to go to win good will. Take Wang Laboratories Inc.'s joint venture in Shanghai, which produces the U.S. company's work stations. A source close to the company says the Shanghai operation, which began in 1986, has enough orders to keep workers busy for only one to two days a week.    The venture is expected to record its first profit this year, largely because the plant's sale of other Wang products in China offsets manufacturing losses. Wang won't comment on its Shanghai venture.    The main problem is that Beijing wants the benefits of computer-technology transfer without having to guarantee a local market for the joint venture's product. But China's market is still too small to make such projects viable, and technology changes so fast that Chinese-style marathon negotiation render models obsolete by the time a manufacturing agreement is reached.    Foreign vendors are particularly vulnerable to sudden changes of heart, budget or policy in China. China's 1986 austerity drive, one of several in the past decade, cost IBM dearly and rendered years of negotiation futile. The U.S. company, which dominates overall computer sales in China, had hoped that its 5550 model, a small computer, would be a big product in China. But high import duties made IBM turn its thoughts to local manufacture. In 1986, after two years of talks, the company came close to signing a joint-venture agreement to assemble the computer in Canton. But the project was abandoned when the austerity campaign denied the necessary foreign exchange to the Chinese partner.    Foreign vendors also suffer from China's tendency to have engineers make purchase decisions, rather than business managers as in the West. Engineers prefer big computer memories and a high processing speed, and they tend to overlook such aspects as the machine's ability to handle complicated ticketing and reservation requirements. This puts some business-computer makers, such as Wang, at a disadvantage.    &quot;Chinese buyers rarely ask which model suits their needs. They simply want the highest technology,&quot; says a business-computer sales executive. Adds another, &quot;How can you expect them to appreciate a computer which has the most sophisticated inventory-control program when stockpiling inventory is commonplace?&quot;    The computer makers also haven't fared well with the concept of brand loyalty. A U.S. computer executive says he was shocked when his Chinese client of seven years defected to another brand. No amount of persuasion about compatibility problems could change his mind -- not even the gift of a refrigerator.    But what infuriated the U.S. executive was the official's request for a final favor. &quot;He asked if I could help him make the two computer systems talk to each other,&quot; he says. &quot;Isn't it a bit too much?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
