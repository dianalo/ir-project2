But the difference betweenthe old and the new remains unclear.   A document approved overwhelmingly by the congress Saturdayterminated the Communist Party _ called the Hungarian SocialistWorkers Party _ and proclaimed the Hungarian Socialist Party itssuccessor.   It was the first time a Warsaw Pact Communist party formallyterminated its existence. The move was part of preparations for thefirst free national elections in 41 years.   On Sunday, the party daily Nepszabadsag appeared without itscustomary title-page citation from the Communist Manifesto:``Workers of the World Unite.''   Instead of the usual masthead proclaiming Nepszabadsag thecentral paper of the Hungarian Socialist Worker's Party, Sunday'sedition simply identifed it as a ``socialist paper.''   Although the congress document sought to define ideological andpractical differences between the old and the new party, seniorofficials differed over what that really meant.   Party Chairman Rezsoe Nyers, true to his role as a moderate,said the document served ``the rebirth of our party as a newleft-wing Socialist Party.''   But Deputy Premier Peter Medgyessy was less optimistic that thecongress had managed to bury the repressive Leninist past andcreate a party in the Western democratic tradition.   Asked if the Hungarian Socialist Party was truly new, he toldreporters Sunday: ``I don't see the signs of that, although Ihonestly would have welcomed it.''   Since the congress opened Friday, radical reformers haveinsisted that orthodox Communists would have no place in the newparty.   But members of the old party are also members of the new party _at least temporarily. ``I am not convinced that the so-calledcleansing (of ranks) that is necessary actually has happened,''Medgyessy said.   Premier Miklos Nemeth, a key reformer, told the congress thatany new party would have no room for ``those with blood on theirhands'' from past Communist exceses.   Membership is not automatically transferable. The position papersaid those wanting to join the new party would first have to statetheir intentions in writing.   But drastic language that would have barred Communistconservatives was watered down out of fears the majority wouldreject the document. The paper stated instead that the new partywants to ``call in its ranks all those who agree with its platform,agree with its ground rules.''   Such ambiguity has resulted in the unsual development of formerPolitburo member Janos Berecz _ among the most vehement opponentsof reform _ asking to join the new party Saturday, just hours afterhe declared himself ready to be ``tied to the stake'' for hisCommunist beliefs.   Nyers, whose moderate views make him the most acceptablecandidate for the post of party president, told Berecz he waswelcome. It was a graphic demonstration of the new party'sdifficulties in breaking with the past.   Berecz later confounded conference participants by declaring hewanted the issue of a new party put to the vote among all membersof the old party. He said in the meanwhile, he would remain amember of the old party.   In another indication that some orthodox Marxists feel the newparty is not substantially different from the old, Berecz supporterRobert Hoch told the congress the Berecz faction was dissolving``because we have accomplished our goal'' of saving the ideals ofthe old party.   But there are striking differences, on paper at least, betweenthe old and the new.   The document condemned the old party's Stalinist excesses,stating that its successor ``separates itself from the crimes,(and) the principles and methods that were proven wrong'' duringthe 41-year tenure of the Communists that included the failed 1956uprising _ the Soviet bloc's bloodiest revolt.   The Hungarian Socialist Party ``wants to contribute to thedevelopment of a ... multiparty system parliamentary democracy,''the document proclaimed.   While expressing support of some state ownership, the documentalso called for private enterprise with minimal controls.   Despite formal loyalties to Marxism-Leninism and theproletariat, the old party had gradually moved toward greaterliberalism under former leader Janos Kadar.   Amid growing dissatisfaction with the pace and extent of reform,Kadar lost his post in May 1988, opening the way to sweepingchanges.   The preponderantly reform-minded leadership allowed politicalopposition to flourish for the first time since the Communistsconsolidated power in 1948. It went even further in February,agreeing to hold the first free elections in 41 years and promisingto abide by the results.   The elections are scheduled for next June at the latest. The newparty is expected to reveal its true nature well before then, as itelects local officials in the next few months.
