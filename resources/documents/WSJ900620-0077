Despite some signs that production by the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries is declining slightly, pricescontinued to slip. Any token cuts by cartel members Kuwaitand the United Arab Emirates are having little impact &quot;in amarket grossly oversupplied with crude,&quot; said Andrew Lebow,analyst for E.D. andamp; F. Man International Futures Inc.</LP><TEXT>   The futures price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil fordelivery during July fell 29 cents a barrel to $15.65, whilecrude for August declined by three cents to $16.92 a barrel.Action was brisk as trading of the July contract came to anend yesterday. Futures prices declined for all barrels of theU.S. benchmark crude being traded through the rest of theyear.   Gasoline and heating oil prices declined as well.   Early trading today may receive some support fromstatistics released after trading yesterday by the AmericanPetroleum Institute. With inventory levels being such animportant factor in the pricing picture, traders have beenanxiously awaiting the release of these numbers.   The figures showed that U.S. crude inventories last weekdeclined by 1.2 million barrels to 384.4 million. Butindustry experts point out that despite the decline, crudestocks still remain 44.3 million barrels above last year'slevel.   Gasoline stocks fell to 216.6 million barrels from 217million the previous week.   Putting more downward pressure on oil prices, at leasteight oil companies, including Chevron Corp. and Mobil Corp.,cut the posted price for their crudes yesterday.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of hog and pork belly futurescontracts slid lower on continuing speculation that recordhigh retail prices of pork are cooling consumer demand, saidJerry Abbenhaus, an analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons, St.Louis. Prices of hogs and pork soared earlier this springamid unexpectedly tight supplies of hogs ready for slaughter.In recent weeks, hog prices have cooled amid signs thatsupermarkets are cutting back their pork purchases andpromoting beef and poultry more heavily. The price of the hogcontract for June delivery, for example, has slipped 8% intrading so far this month. Traders are divided over whetherthe price decline is running out of steam. Some analysts arespeculating that hog prices are past their peak becausefarmers are likely to begin expanding their herds. Others,however, reason that prices might pop up again in the summer,which is when hog prices often reach their peak.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices fell back from recent advances. TheJuly contract ended with a loss of 0.90 cents a pound at$1.13. By late last week the market had become oversold andbegan to rise, one analyst noted. On Monday the July contracthit a high for the move at $1.1540, he said, but yesterdayits highest level was $1.1530, he noted. That technicaldevelopment indicated that the rally had run its course, hesaid. Also, he said, while prices were rising, the openinterest, or contracts outstanding that remain to benullified by an opposite trade or fulfilled by delivery ofthe commodity, fell. &quot;This means that the buying during therally for the most part was really liquidation by traderswho'd previously sold short,&quot; he said. Another analyst saidthe market fell simply because it ran out of rumors. OnMonday, there was a report, which proved unfounded, that O.K.Tedi, a large mine in Papua New Guinea, had labordifficulties, and there has been talk that Asarco Inc., alarge U.S. producer, was encountering problems in its talkswith the United Steelworkers Union, the analyst said. Thecurrent contract expires June 30. &quot;Actually,&quot; he said, &quot;theO.K. Tedi rumor had some impact Monday, but the Asarco onehasn't. The price went down because traders don't believeit.&quot; An Asarco spokesman confirmed that the union had askedfor a strike vote, but added, &quot;That's a normal move in thecourse of negotiations. They're still dealing with localissues.&quot;                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices fell sharply for the thirdconsecutive day. The July contract ended with a loss of 9.60cents a pound at $1.6670 after its daily permissible limitdecline of 10 cents left the price at $1.6630. In threetrading sessions the cumulative loss has been 23.45 cents.All other deferred months dropped their five-cent daily limitfor the third straight day. The limit will be expanded todayto eight cents. The collapse began after two recent reportswere misconstrued by traders, said Judith Ganes, analyst forMerrill Lynch andamp; Co., New York. Two weeks ago, several smallBrazilian processors offered European and Canadian customersa limited quantity of the concentrate for a short time atspecial prices, said Ms. Ganes. &quot;This gave rise to the falsebelief that Brazil was cutting prices and a selling wave hitthe market,&quot; said Ms. Ganes. Last week, the FloridaDepartment of Citrus reported April consumption in the U.S.was sharply below a year earlier, which created furtherpessimism among traders, she said. &quot;What traders didn't takeinto account is that last year's consumption figure wasreally skewed and larger than normal because there had been asignificant switch to orange juice from apple juice byconsumers because of the Alar chemical scare,&quot; Ms. Ganessaid. This distortion exaggerated the year-to-year drop, shesaid. Ms. Ganes noted, however, that a price rebound may bein the making. Processor demand for contracts has been activebut has been overcome by the heavy speculative selling. July2 is the first day on which notices to deliver concentrateagainst July contracts will be issued. Fundamentals stillindicate a tight supply situation, and the Brazilian sellingprice, $2.12 a pound, remains well above the U.S. market, shenoted. &quot;If processors can survive the selling over the nexttwo weeks, they can ask for delivery of the concentrate. Thebulk of the sellers are funds and speculators, who don't havethe material to deliver. If they begin to buy back contractsto avoid delivery commitments, the price could shoot up,&quot; shesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
