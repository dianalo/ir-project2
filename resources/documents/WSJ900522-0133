While Bank of Boston has profited in the past fromleveraged transactions, the outlook is cloudier for some ofthe recent deals it has helped finance, such as theacquisitions of G. Heileman Brewing Co., Friendly Ice Creamand Prime Computer Inc.</LP><TEXT>   The action, which bank spokesmen described as part of anongoing reorganization, underlines a growing wariness bybanks toward leveraged buy-outs. Many banks have recentlytaken a more conservative approach to these loans -- partlybecause of concerns that a slowing economy could spelltrouble for highly leveraged companies, but also because ofpressure from federal regulators and worried investors.   Peter Manning, Bank of Boston's chief financial officer,stressed that the bank intends to continue making loans forso-called highly leveraged transactions, despite thedissolution of the bank's acquisition-finance division. Thedivision, which included about 16 officers, made leveragedbuy-out loans to midsized companies that didn't fall into thebailiwick of the bank's specialized-loan divisions.   Those specialized divisions will continue to seekacquisition loans in industries that the bank hastraditionally served, such as cable television, Mr. Manningsaid.   But Mr. Manning acknowledged that the bank's decision lastfall to tighten its criteria for highly leveragedtransactions, had left the acquisition-finance division with&quot;a thinner net&quot; for landing deals. For example, the bank nowinsists on keeping no more than $50 million of any individualloan, selling off the remaining amount. Previously, the bankwould keep as much as $75 million of a loan.   Some leveraged buy-out specialists say that, while manybanks have become more conservative about leveraged buy-outlending, the pattern is particularly marked at Bank ofBoston. The company, in its first quarter earnings report,noted that it made no new commitments for financing of highlyleveraged transactions during the period. Partly as a result,the bank's portfolio of highly leveraged transactionfinancings shrank to $4.8 billion at March 31 from $5.3billion at Dec. 31. But the smaller total still representsone of the biggest portfolios in the nation -- especially asa proportion of the bank's total assets of $37 billion.   The acquisition-finance division's officers, as well asits assets, have been reassigned to other lending divisions.Gail Long, who had headed the acquisition-finance division,has since been put in charge of the larger national division,handling corporate loans outside New England, a spokesmansaid.   Some of the assets from the acquisition-finance divisionwere placed in the bank's loan-workout division, thespokesman said. But he and Mr. Manning insisted that theproportion of troubled loans wasn't notably high, and thatthe quality of the portfolio wasn't a reason for the decisionto disband the division. The division in previous years hasproduced strong profits for the company, Mr. Manning said.</TEXT></DOC>
