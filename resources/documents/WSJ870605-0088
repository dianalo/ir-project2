The institutions were United Bank of Texas, Austin, which had assets of $202.1 million, and First State Bank, Frisco, which had assets of $40.1 million.    The FDIC arranged the transfer of United Bank's insured deposits to MCorp's MBank Austin unit, because the agency received no bids for the failed bank. United Bank's two offices, closed yesterday by state banking authorities, are to reopen tomorrow as branches of MBank Austin.    United Bank held deposits of $163.1 million in 16,800 accounts, including $1.7 million in 770 accounts that exceeded the federal deposit limit of $100,000 for each depositor. Uninsured depositors will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds from the sale of the failed bank's assets.    First State's office, also closed yesterday by state banking authorities, is to reopen today as a branch of Promenade National Bank, Richardson, Texas. First State held $39.3 million in 5,900 deposit accounts.    Twenty-nine Texas banks have failed this year. </TEXT></DOC>
