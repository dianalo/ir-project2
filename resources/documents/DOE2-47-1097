The additional dose to the thyroid of the adult population in thatarea, received in the first few days of May, is assessed to be 15 mrem,and about 30 mrem to infants, due to the inhalation of iodine-131, moresignificant is the dose due to incorporation of radioactivity via thefood chain (e.g. Cs-137 and Sr-90), as the radionuclides are accumulatedin the body, and part of them will rest there as a lifelong incorporatedsource of radioactivity. However, there is no acute health hazard tobe feared by the population in West Germany, as a result of the reactoraccident, but the dose commitment will result in an increase of cancerrate over the next 30 years, which cannot be assessed.</TEXT></DOC>
