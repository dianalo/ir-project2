The rating concern said its rating on senior debt of the Santa Monica, Calif.-based aerospace and industrial concern was reduced to Ba-2 from single-A-3, and the commercial paper rating was cut to Not Prime from Prime-2. Moody's also lowered its rating on senior debt of the company's Bangor Punta International Capital Co. unit to Ba-2 from single-A-3 and subordinated debt of its Bangor Punta Corp. unit to single-B-1 from Baa-1.    About $50 million of the parent's debt and $100 million of Bangor Punta debt are affected.    Moody's said it expects Lear Siegler debt to rise to about $1.4 billion and its coverage of interest expenses to decline because of the $2.1 billion leveraged buyout. Moody's said it expects Lear Siegler to sell off some Bangor Punta operations to pay off debt, although &quot;the amount or timing of such sales is unknown.&quot;    A Lear Siegler spokesman declined to comment on the downgrade and on speculation about possible asset sales.    Lear Siegler acquired Greenwich, Conn.-based Bangor Punta, a maker of light aircraft and boats, in 1984 for about $290 million. The rating concern said that it expects most of Lear Siegler's earnings to go to its new owners in the form of dividends rather than to reduce debt. </TEXT></DOC>
