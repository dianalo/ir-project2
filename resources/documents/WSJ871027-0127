Under terms of the proposal, Lamson andamp; Sessions would sell substantially all of the assets of the maker of railroad freight car components and the purchaser would assume a substantial portion of the unit's liabilities. Other terms weren't disclosed.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Lamson andamp; Sessions closed yesterday at $4.875, down $1.125.    Lamson andamp; Sessions, a maker of thermoplastic conduit, ducts, fitting and other products used in electrical applications and a fabricator of metal products, said it may have to take a loss provision higher than the $7 million write-off taken in the 1986 fourth quarter for selling Youngstown Steel Door. The company said the additional provision wouldn't be significant. </TEXT></DOC>
