The French company, Axa Midi Assurances, also agreed to invest$942 million in Hoylake Investments Ltd., Goldsmith's takeovervehicle, the British investor said Wednesday.   After Goldsmith announced his group's hostile 13.4 billion poundoffer last month, he said he would sell all of BAT's non-tobaccointerests, including Farmers, if he was successful.   The agreement with Axa Midi ``clearly reaffirms our statedintention that we do not wish to operate Farmers,'' Goldsmith saidin a statement.   BAT, a British conglomerate that has rejected the Hoylake bid,responded to Wednesday's announcement by telling shareholders theywould be deprived of Farmers' current value and future potential ifHoylake were allowed to sell the insurance company ``on the cheap ina forced sale.''   Farmers is the third-largest home and auto insurer and theseventh-biggest property and casualty insurer in the United States.It operates mostly in the western part of the country.   Any acquisition of Farmers, whether by Hoylake or Axa Midi, mustbe approved by insurance regulators in the states where Farmers doesbusiness. BAT acquired Farmers for $5.2 billion last year after aneight-month takeover fight that included battles before theinsurance regulators of several states.   There was heavy opposition to the takeover by BAT in part becausethe conglomerate had no other insurance holdings. However, Axa Midi,which comprises mutual and shareholder-owned insurance companies,has U.S. holdings including Equity and Law, and has a full insurancelicense in 27 states, including seven where Farmers operates.   Axa Midi, one of the largest insurance groups in France andEurope, had premium income of 42 billion French francs, or $6.36billion in 1988.   On Monday, BAT unveiled its defensive strategy against theGoldsmith group, which also includes British merchant banker JacobRothschild and Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer.   The conglomerate, pointing to its past earnings record, toldshareholders they would profit more by holding on to their BAT stockthan by tendering it to Hoylake.   BAT emphasized the strengths of its businesses, which besidesFarmers includes Brown andamp; Williamson tobacco, retailers Saks FifthAvenue and Marshall Field's, and paper maker Appleton Papers inWisconsin.   Securities analysts said they expected BAT to deploy more activedefenses if and when Goldsmith raises his bid.   A takeover of BAT would be the world's second-largest, after the$24.53 billion acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg KravisRoberts andamp; Co. earlier this year.   Goldsmith said Axa Midi's prospective investment would increasethe total cash committed to Hoylake to $2.36 billion.   Axa Midi was to pay half of the $4.5 billion for Farmers in cashat the close of the deal, and the rest in notes with maturities oftwo to three years, Hoylake said.</TEXT></DOC>
