(ITC) and Linotype AG to use theirwell-known typefaces.andP;  Apple today also announced a licensing agreement  withBitstream to provide the digital typeface data for the ITC typefaces.andM;The final set of typefaces that will be included with System 7.0 will beannounced by Apple later this year.andM;(Wendy Woods/19900228/Press Contact: Cindy McCaffrey, 408/974-1578)</TEXT></DOC>
