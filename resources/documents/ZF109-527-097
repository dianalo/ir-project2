(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>RIGHT MAINTENANCE MIX BOLTS DOWN EXPENSESandM;The easiest way to ensure that a VAX site remains up and running is tocontract the maintenance from DEC itself.andP;  But this is rarely the mostcost-effective means of maintaining MIS hardware.andM;An MIS manager can ensure the highest benefit from his maintenance dollar,while keeping downtime low, by putting together a mix of maintenancesuppliers.andP;  In many cases, third-party maintenance suppliers offer discountsof as much as 25 percent whem compared with DEC's maintenance fees, and thesecut-rate prices can represent a substantial savings for many organizations.andM;There are limits, however, to just how much an MIS department should rely onthird-party maintenance vendors.andP;  In most cases, larger VAXes should remainin the tender, loving hands of the DEC maintenance force.andP;  For thesemission-critical machines, DED is often the only place where both parts andknow-how can reliably be found.andM;For midrange machines, like VAX 4000-series systems, the wise choice is toask for bids from third-party service vendors, and consider price as well asthe reputation of the provider as factors.andP;  Typically, third-partymaintenance prices run 15 to 30 percent below DEC's.andP;  In some cases,third-party suppliers have bid 50 percent below DEC.andM;At the desktop and peripheral level, where an increasing amount of the MISinvestment is to be found, the best option is either a third-party contractor in-house maintenance.andP;  MIS managers who cut maintenance costs at theselevels can realize substantial savings because of the large number of devicesinvolved.andM;In-house maintenance generally proves to be most profitable for installationswith numerous small computing systems because, in most cases, the cost ofmaintaining a small computer is a much higher percentage of the total cost ofownership.andP;  (See &quot;Maintenance as percentage of overall system cost,&quot; above.)andO;In other words, $250,000 worth of workstations will need more frequentmaintenance than a VAX 6000-series system worth $250,000.andM;Many third-party service providers push for an arrangement in which theyfunction as the &quot;primary contractor.&quot;andP;  Like a general contractor in theconstruction industry, independents acting as primary contractors providesome services, and subcontract for the rest.andP;  They also assist as needed withwhatever work customers opt to perform in-house.andP;  It's the prime contractor'sresponsibility to match the appropriate service provider, and the besttechnician from each provider, with each job.andM;The principal benefit afforded by primary contractor arrangements is thatthey give MIS managers a single person to contact for every possible serviceproblem.andP;  In addition, the contact will know each site's configuration andmaintenance history.andP;  This proves particularly helpful for sites that have adiverse range of devices and therefore require servicing from numerousproviders.andP;  Such vendors sell easy access to maintenance, which translatesinto time savings and fewer headaches.andM;These arrangements aren't risk-free.andP;  Even third-party maintenance suppliersadmit there are times when the primary contractor may look after his owninterests before the interests of the customer.andP;  As in the constructionindustry, an overloaded computer maintenance primary contractor may betempted to dump jobs on less-qualified subcontractors.andM;KEEPING PACE WITH LOWER COSTSandM;During the past decade, DEC has slashed maintenance fees for big systems.andO;Since 1977, DEC's monthly service fee for a VAX priced at $250,000 has fallenfrom $1,700 to $975.andP;  A new feature is that today's DEC fees also covermaintenance for basic VAX software.andM;Third-party maintenance providers have nevertheless kept pace.andP;  Many of thesecompanies compete by tying their rates to DEC's.andP;  Whatever DEC's price istoday, third parties will typically provide the same service for somepercentage discount.andM;For example, the annual cost of a DECservice maintenance contract for ano-frills VAX 6000 Model 410 is $595 per month, or $7,140 per year, accordingto numbers provided by the Ledgeway Group, a market research company inLexington, Mass.andP;  That contract consists of 8 a.m.-to-5 p.m.andP;  service fivedays a week, with a guaranteed response time of two to four hours.andP;  Athird-party maintenance vendor, by contrast, might charge $5,700 or lessannually for the same service, amounting to a small savings of approximately$ 1,400 per year.andM;Although third-party per-unit discounts for small and midsized systems,workstations and peripherals are smaller still, savings add up quickly when alarge number of computers need to be maintained.andP;  With a large enoughinstallation, and MIS manager can take advantage of this economy of scale togenerate substantial savings.andM;For example, DECservice maintenance for a MicroVAX II is priced at $3,960 peryear.andP;  A third-party maintenance vendor's 20 percent discount would cut thisprice to $3,168.andP;  At first blush, this may seem a rather paltry savings.andP;  Butif a company owns 20 MicroVAX IIs, in a single year it could save about$16,000--roughly the price of a new MicroVAX 3100--by going with the thirdparty.andM;Despite such savings, many MIS managers are reluctant to plunge intothird-party maintenance.andP;  And to be sure, many factors argue in DEC's favor.andO;For instance, DEC has many years' experience servicing its own equipment.andO;Its three customer support centers in the United States field some 3 millionservice calls a year, and its 11 worldwide service centers process 8.6million service calls annually.andM;DEC's considerable field service experience, its numerous and attractivemaintenance contract support features, plus the &quot;warm feeling&quot; of having adirect line to DEC, appear to be worth the 20 percent premium for many MISmanagers.andP;  In certain industries, such as banking, almost 90 percent of DECsites buy DEC maintenance, according to a survey by Computer Economics, aconsulting company in Carlsbad, Calif.andM;ADDING VALUEandM;DEC will often undercut its own standard service rates to lure customers awayfrom third-party maintenance providers.andP;  Another way DEC increases the returnon an MIS manager's maintenance fees is through value-added services.andM;One such service is the &quot;high-density&quot; contract, in which DEC places a fieldservice engineer at a site for a certain number of hours primarily to do workthat the site's in-house staff can't handle.andM;This service may strongly affect the cost-justification equation because ofthe additional labor savings it represents.andP;  For example, some customers havereported that as a result of having that extra engineer, they have recoupedas much as 80 percent of their maintenance costs in personnel cost savings.andO;However, this option is best-suited for MIS departments in which existingpersonnel are either underqualified or too few for the maintenance tasksrequired.andM;Other value-added services DEC offers include education, consultation andsuch high-visibility functions as developing a disaster-recovery plan forcustomers.andM;Despite their advantages, DEC's value-added services don't counter thefundamental economic rule governing computer maintenance: It's easier tojustify high costs for maintaining a few larger machines than for a sizablefleet of smaller computers.andM;As a result, MIS managers are increasingly maintaining mid-range range andsmaller systems in-house.andP;  There are fewer risks in maintenance handled bystaff today than there were even five years ago.andP;  In recent years, computerequipment has become much more reliable, and problems easier to diagnose andfix.andP;  For example, an East Coast manufacturer reports that uptime for itscomputer operations during the past 10 years has gone from 95 percent to 99.5percent.andM;Another reason for the growing popularity of in-house maintenance is thatin-house technicians are getting better training, often by attending DECtraining programs.andM;In addition, there's another source of maintenance for DEC sites: theso-called &quot;fourth-party&quot; vendors who chisel out very narrow niches incomputer repair--servicing dot matrix print heads, for example--and providesmall but steady savings by reconditioning parts.andP;  For instance, one largeuniversity reconditions six to 10 print heads a month at a fourth-partycompany and realizes an annual savings of $2,500 over the cost of new printheads.andM;Because in-house staff costs are considerably lower than those imposed by DECor third-party providers, in-house maintenance can prove much less expensive.andO;At a salary of $30,000 a year, with overhead and benefits added, an in-housetechnician costs a company $20 to $25 an hour.andM;If there is sufficient work to keep a full-time technician busy, this figurecompares favorably with as much as $150 an hour charged by DEC and somethird-party independents, or even the nationwide average hourly price foron-site service, which ranges from $90 to $100.andM;But per-hour cost comparisons don't tell the whole story.andP;  Not only mustthere be sufficient work to keep in-house technicians busy, but this approachcarries additional overhead costs.andP;  These include tools and test equipment,which are one-time expenses, as well as running costs incurred by the need tomaintain an inventory of spare parts and storage space for those parts, aswell as a repair workshop, if one exists.andM;In addition, real estate demands can pile on significant expenses inhigh-rent districts, where a square foot of office space can cost $100 ormore.andM;When a full-time technician can't be justified, one money-saving alternativeinvolves devoting staff to preventive maintenance.andM;In a recent survey conducted by Media Research Associates, a market researchcompany in New York, third-party maintenance providers said at least half oftheir service calls involve repair work the customers could have avoided withregular preventive maintenance.andM;Such preventive measures include cleaning keyboards, device housings andprinter components.andP;  Because these tasks require little training orspecialized knowledge, the labor cost can prove relatively inexpensive.andM;If a historical trouble report indicates that an organization's equipmentsuffers from problems that are amenable to preventive maintenance, the laborcost would be overridden by the leverage it provides in preventing morecostly repairs down the road.andP;  If an MIS manager pays for equipment servicingon an hourly basis, savings on preventive maintenance can reach 50 percent.andM;In the past, easier access to diagnostic equipment was something third-partycompanies had in their favor over in-house service.andP;  But diagnostic softwareis now so good that someone with a relatively small amount of technicalcompetence can troubleshoot at an assembly or subassembly level.andM;On the other hand, many DEC users note that technology is changing so fastthat the diagnostic software is generally a step behind DEC's currenttechnology.andM;Still, outside providers have a lot of advantages to offer over in-houseservice.andP;  For one, they can obtain volume discounts on parts that theircustomers usually can't qualify for.andP;  In addition, they can provide bettercontinuity of service because their staffs--especially the higher-paidpros--are less likely to jump from shop to shop than people of equalexperience and talent at user sites.andM;Negotiating a contract for outside maintenance service, whether from DEC or athird party, requires prudence.andM;For example, service contracts should include a &quot;continuous effort&quot; or&quot;same-day&quot; clause stipulating that service providers will stay at a job untilfaulty equipment is repaired.andP;  An energy company in Texas learned about thatclause the hard way when a technician left promptly at 5 p.m., leaving astill-malfunctioning peripheral.andM;MIS managers who need fail-safe assurance that they'll get quick turnaroundtime for repairs should also make certain the third-party supplier guaranteeshe can stock critical parts locally.andP;  Cash penalties should apply fornegligence in this regard, pegged to the customer's lost revenues caused bymaintenance delays.andM;ALL THE STOPSandM;Driven by competitive pressures, all maintenance providers, including DEC,are doing more than just cutting prices.andP;  Some are taking innovative andsophisticated steps to improve service and response time.andM;For example, some maintenance providers employ automated dispatch softwarethat decides who is best-suited to respond to a service call and thenautomatically contacts the technician via beeper.andP;  If all technicians arebusy, the system kicks the call to a supervisor.andM;In addition, third-party maintenance vendors are taking steps to freecustomers from the paper deluge that often accompanies service contracts.andO;For instance, an independent service vendor with a large client base recentlyintroduced a contract that consolidates its various service offerings.andP;  Thesingle, simplified document provides terms and conditions for various levelsof service to cover more than 400 brands of equipment.andM;Although some MIS managers might think that they must choose one maintenancesolution over another, that clearly isn't true--or wise.andP;  Chances are thatthe most cost-effective and efficient method of maintaining computing devicesis through careful selection of a variety of maintenance resources.andM;Particularly for MIS managers coping with large numbers of workstations orsmaller computers as part of their system mix, multipronged maintenanceschemes--mingling preventive plans and other self-maintenance with variouscommercial offerings--can prove to be the safest service road to travel.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
