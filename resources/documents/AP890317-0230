Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., made a move to short-circuitRepublican opposition while union officials appealed separately to aSenate committee for changes in the federal bankruptcy law thatwould weaken the company's hand in the bitter dispute.   Under Senate rules, the vote on the Democratic attempt to advancethe legislation was put off until April 5. The measure, approvedearlier in the week by the Democratic-controlled House, wouldrequire President Bush to name an emergency board to recommend asolution to the strike and would impose a 26-day cooling-off periodduring which the airline's employees would receive pre-strike wages.   Eastern oppposes the bill, and Bush has argued that disputeshould be settled directly between the two sides.   The maneuvering on the Senate floor came while union leaderscalled on the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow Eastern'screditors access to the assets of the parent company, Texas AirCorp. The proposal brought an immediate objection from Texas Airofficials.   Eastern sought protection from its creditors under the bankruptcycode on March 9, five days after its unions began their walkout.Negotiations to end the strike and an accompanying syumpathy walkoutby pilots are moribund, and the intensifying struggle in Congressmarked a new phase in the dispute.   ``Bankruptcy has become a tool in the hands of people like FrankLorenzo to break their unions,'' said William Winpisinger, presidentof the International Association of Machinists, whose dispute withEastern provoked the strike.   Frank Lorenzo is the chairman of Texas Air and has been accusedby Eastern's unions of selling the carrier's assets to other TexasAir subsidiaries to Eastern's detriment.   Elliott Seiden, Texas Air's associate general counsel, counteredthat the proposed legislation would threaten healthy companiessimply because they are partial owners of ailing subsidiaries.   ``In the future, no corporation could or would consider acquiringa troubled airline or starting a new airline,'' Seiden said.   On the Senate floor, lawmakers debated another labor-supportedbill that would force President Bush to try to help end the bitterstrike.   Republicans staved off Democratic efforts to consider theHouse-passed measure quickly Thursday night, arguing that the issueis so complex that it should be studied for at least a week by aSenate committee. Bush has opposed the bill and his aides have saidhe would veto it.   GOP lawmakers made it clear Thursday night that they would useSenate rules to block any vote at least until the chamber returnsfrom its two-week Easter recess, which begins tonight.   ``I don't say there'd be a filibuster, but the debate will beintense, and I think there are a lot of different views,'' saidSenate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.   Under a filibuster, lawmakers attempt to use lengthy debate tokill legislation.   The legislation before the full Senate would require Bush to namean emergency board to recommend a solution to the strike, and wouldimpose a cooling-off period of up to 26 days during which theairline's employees would receive pre-strike wages.   Bush has argued the dispute between Eastern and its unions, whichhas built up over 17 months, should be settled directly between thetwo sides.   Supporters of the measure have argued that a presidential boardcould present a proposal each side could agree to without appearingto give in to the other.   After hours of closed-door meetings between Democrats andRepublicans ended late Thursday, Senate Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell, D-Maine, tried to commence debate on the measure, arguingthat steps should be taken to end the two-week old walkout.   ``The cooling-off period won't hurt. It will help,'' saidMitchell. ``What would hurt is further delay and further inaction.''   Republicans countered that more study was needed.   ``To just ram this thing down on the floor. ... I think is justrushing blindly into a situation where we might doom any potentialEastern has to save itself at all,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.   The airline's 8,500-member International Association ofMachinists precipitated the walkout, and were followed by Eastern'spilots and flight attendants.   The House passed the union-supported bill by a 252-167 vote, withall but 20 votes coming from its majority Democrats.</TEXT></DOC>
