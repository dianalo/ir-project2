Before it was downgraded to a tropical depression early today,the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season also wasblamed for the partial collapse of the roof at Northline Mall inHouston and for the capsizing of a tugboat in Galveston Bay. Noserious injuries were reported in those incidents.   The slow-moving storm swept ashore Monday about 60 milessouthwest of Houston. Forecasters said rainfall eventually might bemeasured in feet.   ``We hope it won't become a reality but it is a possibility,''Ron Stagno of the National Weather Service in Houston.   No relief was expected until late today because the system wasmoving so slowly _ only 6 mph to the north.   During the morning rush hour, high water closed both majorhighways into Houston from the north, and freeway underpasses andservice roads were littered with abandoned vehicles.   ``It's a helpless feeling,'' said stranded motorist Miles Nye.``There's nothing you can do. You just watch the water moving up.''   Some underpasses had as much as 15 or 20 feet of water. An emptycity bus stuck in an underpass near downtown was barely visible inthe water.   At 5 a.m., the poorly defined center of the depression was about50 miles north of Houston.   Maximum sustained winds dropped to 35 mph with 45 mph gusts alongthe eastern Texas-western Louisiana coast, the National HurricaneCenter in Coral Gables, Fla., said. Maximum sustained winds must beat least 39 mph for a depression to be a named tropical storm.   More than 10 inches of rain fell in the Houston area during the24 hours that ended early today, the weather service said. ``Themain thing is the rain,'' said meteorologist Larry Vannozzi. ``It'sa heavy rainmaker.''   The heavy rain and flooding extended into southwestern Louisiana,where a tornado overturned trailers in rural Hackberry today. InTexas, authorities reported a tornado Monday evening at Smithpointand Double Bayou.   The storm was blamed for the fatal traffic accident of a46-year-old Port Neches man Monday evening, police said.   Rain fell at an inch per hour in some areas and deluges wereexpected to continue today into east Texas and southwest Louisiana.   Hardest hit areas were along the Texas coast although damageappeared to be minor, confined to downed power lines and some roofshingles blown away. Damage from high water also was reported.   Flash-flood warnings were in effect for the coastal countiessouth of Houston while the rest of southeast Texas was under aflash-flood watch.   ``It's starting to come up pretty fast,'' Don Best, of Danbury inBrazoria County, said as his family tried to save householdbelongings from rising waters. ``We're trying to put our furnitureup as fast as we can.''   In east Houston, fire department airboats were used to evacuatedozens of residents of two apartment complexes bordering a bayou.   ``It doesn't look like there's going to be any relief,'' firemanLester Tyra said. ``The only way out is with an airboat.''   Allison was upgraded to a tropical storm Monday morning. Thestorm had its origins in Hurricane Cosme, which moved from thePacific Ocean across Mexico last week. The Atlantic hurricane seasonruns from June to November.   In Galveston Bay, the capsized tugboat sent a barge loaded withbenzene aground in the Houston Ship Channel. Three people escapedserious injury and the barge was not believed to be damaged, CoastGuard spokesman Mark Kennedy said.   ``It may be able to ride out the storm aground,'' Kennedy said.``These are fairly soft and sandy bars and reefs so maybe it won'tbe a problem.''   Houston Lighting andamp; Power Co. at one point reported 30,000customers without electricity.   The University of Houston, Rice University and Texas SouthernUniversity were among schools to cancel classes.</TEXT></DOC>
