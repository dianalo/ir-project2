 It is sensationalized and overblown, pandering to thefears of the general public, and it is appallingly lacking in substance andbasic facts.andP;  As a result, computer users often react with same kind ofhysteria that accompanied the beginnings of the AIDS epidemic.andP;  Thanks to thediligence of many organizations in the fight against AIDS, the public is muchbetter informed now about AIDS, and the hysteria level has droppedandM;considerably.andP;   The same sort of education is needed on the subjectandM;of computer viruses to calm the mounting panic.andM;Computer tampering has been around almost as long as computers themselves.andO;In business computing in the past, the culprit was usually a disgruntledemployee who somehow attacked the system and its programs.andP;  Now, in the ageof telecommunications and networking, many more people have the ability toattempt to &quot;get&quot; a company's computers.andP;  You can't protect yourselfabsolutely, but you can take steps to minimize your exposure and to softenthe impact if someone does succeed in attacking your company's system, eitherdeliberately or accidentally.andP;  Here are some recommended precautions.andM;Education: As NBC's &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; put it, &quot;Remember that when youconnect to another computer, you are connecting to every computer that it hasconnected to.&quot;andP;  This was meant humorously, but it happens to be truenonetheless.andP;  If your company is networked, you are only as safe as theweakest link in the chain.andP;  You need to educate everyone about the dangersand have everyone participate in the safeguards.andM;Screen Employees: Most computer tampering and almost all computer crime istraced to someone on the inside.andP;  You need to have a lot of faith in youremployees, so choose them well.andP;  Before computers, a malicious employee couldcause minor damage and perhaps cost you a customer or two.andP;  Now, if yourbusiness is highly computerized, a misguided employee can destroy yourbusiness.andP;  So choose carefully the people you are trusting with yourcompany's precious data.andM;Safe Software: While there's no such thing as a sure thing, your best bet foravoiding software viruses is to use only commercial software that you haveacquired through normal distribution channels.andP;  A shrink-wrapped copy ofExcel bought at a major computer store is vastly less likely to be virusinfested than a copy &quot;borrowed&quot; from someone or purchased second-hand.andP;  Ifyou're going to download software, get it from a commercial service or BBSthat you know checks its submissions, and be discriminating.andP;  As one of thesysops of MAUG on CompuServe, I have seen many messages from people sayingthings like, &quot;I down-loaded this INIT and installed it, but what does it do?&quot;andO;Needless to say, it is not very smart to install software on your machine ifyou don't know what it does.andM;Protection: For a little extra safety, acquire and use programs such asVaccine, from CE Software, and Interferon, written by Robert Woodhead.andO;Vaccine constantly monitors your system for suspicious behavior and warns youif a program is about to do something irregular, allowing you to stop it.andO;Interferon performs after-the-fact checking, scanning your disks for evidenceof known viruses and other tampering.andP;  These programs don't offer absoluteprotection, but some protection is better than none.andM;Backup: If you're using your Mac for business, you should already know theimportance of performing regular backups.andP;  For protection from viruses andother tampering, you may want to perform generational backup, making newbackups instead of reusing the same media.andP;  It's more expensive, but theremay come a time when you have to go back days or weeks to retrieve anunaffected copy of a file.andM;You should also take special care of your backups, locking them up for safetyand storing some of them off-site.andP;  Remember, someone on the inside coulddestroy the backups if they're left out in the open.andM;It's also a good idea to keep a separate backup of your System folder in apristine state.andP;  Besides viruses and tampering, there are many problems thatcan damage System files, and restoring your System folder will sometimes stoprecurring system bombs.andM;Never Cry Wolf: If you do suddenly start experiencing problems with programsthat worked fine before, don't panic and start screaming &quot;Virus!&quot;andP;  It is muchmore likely that your problem is the result of a damaged System file.andP;  AsINITs and cdev files have become more popular, many problems turn out to becaused by interactions between these programs.andM;So before you cry wolf, try replacing your System files and removing INITsand cdevs.andP;  If the problem goes away, reinstall the INITs and cdevs one byone until the problem recurs and you can determine at least part of theproblem.andP;  For long-term stability, choose the INITs and cdevs you use verycarefully and try to limit their number.andM;PINSTRIPE PICKSandM;Here are some products worth a look if you're worried about viruses.andM;Vaccine (CE Software).andP;  A cdev that monitors your system for suspiciousevents.andP;  Provided free as a public service, available on CompuServe and othermajor on-line services.andM;Interferon (Robert Woodhead).andP;  A program that checks for virus infection andtampering after the fact.andP;  Available on CompuServe and other major on-lineservices.andP;  Free, although a donation to a charity is requested.andM;Redux (Microseeds).andP;  Excellent backup and recovery program that featuresscripting for custom backups.andM;Network DiskFit (SuperMac).andP;  Special version of the popular backup programthat can back up AppleShare file servers and keep all access privilegesintact.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
