In Washington, a State Department spokesman said the UnitedStates intends to abide by the treaties.   The Panamanian government statement, issued in Panama City, said:``The Foreign Ministry has been following the development of aunilateral thesis in the U.S. State Department under which theneutrality treaty would allow a limited U.S. military presence inPanama past Dec. 31, 1999.''   The Panama Canal treaties, signed by President Carter andPanamanian leader Omar Torrijos in 1977, stipulate that on Dec. 31,1999, ``only the Republic of Panama will operate the canal andmaintain military forces, defense sites and military installationsinside national territory.''   The Panamanian Foreign Ministry said the U.S. intention to remainin Panama after 1999 is ``one of the main reasons for the economicaggression and the threatening use of force against Panama.''   Asked about Panama's charges, State Department spokesman DennisHarter in Washington said, ``It's not the first time they've saidanything like that. They've said it fairly frequently.   ``We intend to abide by the Panama Canal treaties,'' he added inan interview with The Associated Press. ``We have been and we intendto continue to.''   The United States imposed economic sanctions on Panama earlierthis year and expanded its military force along the canal in aneffort to force Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to step down.   Noriega, head of the armed forces and de facto leader of Panama,is under U.S. indictment on charges of drug trafficking and moneylaundering. He denies the accusations.   The Foreign Ministry statement alluded to a document issued lastweek by Army's Southern Command saying that after 1999 ``the UnitedStates will continue showing its determination to support theneutrality and operation of the Panama Canal as well as regional andU.S. security interests.''   The Southern Command report said the U.S. Defense Departmentapproved ``a preliminary plan for an orderly, phased withdrawal fromPanama,'' but it did not give specific withdrawal dates. It alsosaid the Southern Command now operating along the banks of thePanama Canal will not be eliminated when U.S. military presence endsin Panama. However, it did not say where the Southern Command willbe located.   The U.S. Army has about 13,000 troops assigned to the SouthernCommand, about 3,000 of whom arrived in March to add pressure onNoriega.</TEXT></DOC>
