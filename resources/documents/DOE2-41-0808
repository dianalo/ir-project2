<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-41-0808 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Canadian Geothermal Energy Program has always been regarded as oneof resource identification and assessment, rather than one of resourceconversion and utilization technology. Consequently, this program hasbeen made up of earth sciences and mineral exploration components. Nevertheless,a regard for the available technology and markets for geothermal energyhas played a major part in determining the geographical areas of research.Most of the work in the program has been done under contract, and from1976 to 1981 there were three overall projects: delineation of majorgeothermal anomalies; identification and assessment of geothermal resourcesfor possible exploitation; and investigating the low-grade geothermalenergy potential from sedimentary basins. For 1981-82 the first two ofthose projects were revised to: identification and assessment of geothermalresources in non-volcanic terrain, and identification and assessmentof geothermal systems associated with recent volcanic activity. A newproject was added, exploring the geothermal resources of the Atlanticregion. Specific projects highlighted in this report are the discoveryof a possible geothermal steam reservoir under Mt. Meager in BritishColumbia, and investigation of the feasibility of using low-grade hotwater from the sedimentary basin under Regina for space heating. 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
