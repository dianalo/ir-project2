Nobody wants to suffer the ill effects of a virus, butpast warnings about particular strains of such viruses haveoften proved overblown, with relatively few cases of realdamage.   In general, I hesitate to echo dire warnings of viruses,partly because they often come from the makers ofvirus-detection software. But the latest scare, about a virusnamed Michelangelo, warrants more attention than most.   Michelangelo is a particularly destructive virus designedto wipe out the entire contents of your hard disk drive onMarch 6, a week from tomorrow, if you have an IBM-compatiblepersonal computer that's been infected. Even if it strikesonly a tiny percentage of computers, it could do greatdamage. Moreover, Michelangelo has already shown up on a fewcommercially sold floppy and hard disks. And it spreads in asneaky way that could trap even normally careful users.   So, this week, I'll tell how to stymie Michelangelo. Nextweek, I'll discuss virus prevention in general, which can beconfusing.   A computer virus is a small program created by a maliciousprogrammer for the sole purpose of spreading itself fromcomputer to computer and then carrying out functions withoutthe owners' permission. Some viruses merely propagate, takingup disk space or slowing processing. Others display unwantedmessages on your screen. A few, like Michelangelo, are trulypernicious, destroying or damaging programs and files.                                                                                                          Michelangelo's name derives from its March 6 trigger date,also the birthday of the great artist. The virus residesinvisibly on an infected computer until that date comes up onthe computer's internal clock, in any year. Then, wheneverthe computer is started or restarted on March 6, itdetonates, overwriting all of your hard disk files.   Viruses typically spread by the transfer of programscarrying an undetected infection. Such transfers usuallyoccur through computer networks or bulletin boards, so peoplewho don't trade programs this way often feel safe.   But the Michelangelo strain moves differently. It hides onfloppy disks and spreads to a new computer whenever someonetries to start (&quot;boot&quot;) the computer from an infected floppy.The virus will spread even if the attempt to start thecomputer from the floppy fails. Once your computer isinfected, the Michelangelo virus will infect every otherfloppy you put into it.   There's one consolation: The virus won't spread if youmerely copy files from a floppy to your hard disk, only ifyou try to start your computer from the floppy, a much lesscommon procedure.   Here are steps you can take to protect yourself againstthe Michelangelo virus:   -- Back up the entire contents of your hard disk, usingany backup program. This creates a copy of all your files ona tape or a set of floppy disks. If the virus wipes you out,you can later rebuild your hard disk's contents from thisarchive.   -- Obtain and use an anti-virus program to see whetherMichelangelo is hiding on your hard disk, and eradicate it ifyou find it. Also use this software to check any floppy disksyou intend to use to start your computer.                                                                                                          Make sure the version of the anti-virus software you'reusing is new enough to cover the Michelangelo virus, whichfirst came to software makers' attention late last summer. Ifyour version is too old, or if you don't have antivirussoftware, try to get one of the low-cost promotionalprograms, offered by several software companies, that goafter the Michelangelo virus. Details on these are below.   -- As a last resort, you can trick the virus by settingyour computer's internal clock to March 7, 1992, by no laterthan March 5. Or, you can leave your computer on from March 5until March 7, without restarting it. These methods willprevent the virus from detonating, but they carry risks. Awrong date may make your computer inaccurate, and if youdon't change the clock, an accidental restart on March 6could wipe you out. If your machine is infected, the viruswill still strike every March 6 in the future, and yourcomputer will still spread the virus to every floppy you use.   Symantec, Santa Monica, Calif., which makes the NortonAntiVirus program for PCs, is offering a specialMichelangelo-only version for $9. Or, with a modem, you candownload the special program free of charge (except for thephone call) from the company's bulletin board.   Microcom, Norwood, Mass., which makes the Virex program,offers a similar Michelangelo-only program free of charge onits bulletin board. Central Point Software, Beaverton, Ore.,offers a similar special version of its Central PointAnti-Virus Software for $29.   There's also a noncommercial anti-virus package, calledViruscan, by McAfee Associates, Santa Clara, Calif., whichhas long been available on many bulletin boards. The latestversions can tackle Michelangelo.</TEXT></DOC>
