(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Report Writer PrimerandM;No matter if your software application is written in dBASE, Revelation,COBOL, or BASIC, you need the ability to extract data in a meaningful form.andO;Of course everyone has a different idea of what's meaningful.andP;  Generalpurpose business applications often fall short in this area.andP;  The authors ofthese business applications have written programs that do nothing but convertexisting data files into dBASE format and run reports against the converteddata.andP;  Even then, the user may want to create more reports without paying(and waiting) for each of them.andP;  Report writing programs make this possible.andO;In fact, it may be more cost-effective for some clients to have a programmerset them up with a report writer in the first place.andM;Many programmers &quot;hand code&quot; reports using dBASE language commands ratherthan dBASE FRM files.andP;  But when users want to do ad hoc reports and queriesagainst an application's data, they must resort to either a built-in dBASEreport writer or an external program.andP;  There are also times when hand codinggets tedious--a report writing program that generates dBASE source code cansave time for programmers and money for their clients.andM;With all the options available to users of dBASE-based systems, it'ssometimes hard to find the right solution for a particular user.andP;  In searchof the perfect external report program, we reviewed Snow Software's SnowReport Writer, Concentric Data Systems, Inc.'s Randamp;R Relational Report Writer,and Database Application, Inc.'s dNPL/Reporter (and dRandamp;G, a superset withgraphics ability).andP;  For the comparison, we also reviewed Ashton-Tate's dBASEIV report writer, which sets a new standard for built-in reportingcapabilities.andP;  All these programs allow you to present data in differentforms; as we'll see, this can be accomplished in many different ways.andM;Getting startedandM;All of the products had good documentation.andP;  We had almost no troubleinstalling any of them.andP;  The only exception was in the rather complicatedinstallation for dRandamp;G, which could use some improvement.andM;We identified our criteria for review as performance in five primary areas.andM;Quick queriesandM;Most computer users need to quickly view different configurations of data.andO;We need to examine data selected by various keys.andP;  We usually need to filterthe data in two ways: subsets of information within eachrecord/row/transaction (selected &quot;fields&quot; or &quot;columns&quot;) and subsets ofrecords/rows that meet various conditions.andP;  For instance, you might want toview the names, phone numbers, and contact names of all customers who haven'tbought anything in the last six months, so you can call these customers andfind out why they're not buying.andP;  The columns, or fields, you want might becalled NAME, CONTACT, and PHONE--the other fields are ignored in this query.andO;Rows, or records, might be selected (or rejected) using a formula like DATE -LAST_SALE [is greater than] 182.andM;Generally, simple one-file queries work like our thinking process.andP;  We filterout everything that doesn't apply to the job at hand and look at the rest.andO;Management usually wants summary information, grouped by sales area/category,date, etc.andP;  (&quot;How many widgets did office 12 sell in January?andP;  How does thiscompare to the rest of our offices?&quot;).andP;  Customer support people wantdifferent information (&quot;What's the payment history for Acme?andP;  Who's ourcontact there?&quot;).andP;  A salesperson may be more interested in products that meetspecified criteria, prices, availability, and so on.andP;  But they all have onething in common: They want the information quickly.andM;In on-screen queries, speed is usually more important than a fancy layout.andO;Printed reports are expected to be more attractive and comprehensive--quickqueries are more often used to locate a small subset of the data in a hurry.andM;Printed reportsandM;Printed reports differ from on-screen queries in several ways.andP;  Since aprinted page is longer, the layout differs.andP;  More extensive headings identifywhich printout you're looking at, and the presentation needs to be moreattractive if the report is to be viewed by others.andM;If you're used to using a desktop publishing program for printed output, youknow how advantageous it is to work in a true &quot;WYSIWYG&quot; (What You See Is WhatYou Get) environment.andP;  None of the report writers we reviewed has a graphicalinterface, so true WYSIWYG design is only available in interfaces toPageMaker, Ventura, and the like.andM;Printer drivers are necessary to take advantage of advanced features suppliedby today's printers.andP;  Printer drivers specific to each printer make itpossible to first tell the report writer what printer you're using, and thendesignate which elements you want in bold face, italics, etc..andP;  The reportwriter automatically adds the appropriate control codes from the printerdriver.andP;  We consider this an important feature.andP;  It's hard to explain tousers why they can't use all the features of their laser printer for reports.andM;None of the packages reviewed supports Postscript printers; dBASE IV has aPostscript driver, but it doesn't work well.andP;  The programs that supportprinter drivers (dBASE IV and Randamp;R Report Writer) feature such standardoptions as compressed, letter quality, bold, underline, and primitive fontcontrol.andP;  Snow Report Writer is limited to sending user-specified strings ofcontrol characters to the printer, and dNPL/Reporter has no built-in printerspecific controls (although it is very snappy at on-screen queries).andM;Ease of useandM;It's usually easier to design effective reports using a full-screen format.andO;Units of information can be placed and moved around so that the format yousee on the screen is at least similar to the printed output.andP;  All but one ofthe products feature a full screen report design surface.andP;  The exception,dNPL/Reporter, uses a simple command line language (and command files, likeprograms) to generate reports.andM;Using the command line approach, a knowledgeable user can sometimes generatequeries and reports more quickly, but there's a limit to how good the printedoutput can look.andP;  Today's user has also come to expect a menu-driven,full-screen work surface with context-specific help.andP;  How often do users readthe manual these days?andP;  How often do programmers?andM;Linking capabilitiesandM;Linking means the ability to relate information in various data files.andP;  Theselinks are based on information common to both files.andP;  For instance, youwouldn't expect to see customer names stored in an invoice file.andP;  Normally, a(shorter and unique) customer code stored in each invoice record makes itpossible to look up the customer's name (and other customer information)stored in a separate customer file.andP;  As a rule, the more redundant andinefficient the data storage, the easier it is to build a report, since youneed fewer cross-file look-ups.andM;When working with dBASE files, you can usually reduce multi-file reportingtime by using existing index files.andP;  These index files are used to quicklylook up corresponding data in the second file.andP;  Of the three external reportwriters, only Randamp;R Report Writer supports dBASE-style index files (Randamp;R canalso support FoxBASE+ and Clipper indexes, which use their own format).andP;  Wethink that's a significant advantage.andM;Applications developmentandM;featuresandM;Report writers aren't the exclusive domain of the end user.andP;  In many casesit's easier for a programmer to generate a report using a report writer thanto code the report.andP;  Some report writers supply a runtime module that allowsyou to run reports from within an application without first converting themto source code.andP;  The runtime module takes extra RAM; so, if available memoryspace is short, you may need to swap your application to disk beforeexecuting the runtime module.andP;  Before the ability to swap applications todisk was widely available, the biggest problem with runtime reporting moduleswas that they took up too much RAM.andP;  With the advent of quick swappingprograms that use both disk space and EMS, this limitation has become lessirritating.andP;  In certain situations, especially with EXE-compiled code,complicated reports requiring large amounts of source code may actually bemore efficiently executed through a runtime module with swapping.andM;Some developers want dBASE source code that they can integrate into theirapplication program.andP;  Of the programs reviewed, only Randamp;R Report Writer andthe dBASE IV report writer generate dBASE source code.andP;  We consider this agreat advantage for developers.andP;  Randamp;R also features a runtime version thatallows you to execute special reports not easily accomplished with dBASEcode.andM;dBASE IV's report writerandM;dBASE IV 1.0's report writing environment sets the new standard for ease ofuse and versatility.andP;  It greatly surpasses the report generation capabilitiesof previous dBASE versions.andP;  Its design is, in many ways, superior toanything we've seen.andP;  The integration into the rest of dBASE IV's ControlCenter isn't as seamless as we might like, but on a whole, this report writeris a great improvement over previous versions.andM;The work surface consists of a series of &quot;bands,&quot; each designated by logicalfunction (see Fig.andP;  1).andP;  It's similar to Randamp;R's interface, but stronger insome ways.andP;  You can open or close bands to create a series of variant reportsquickly.andP;  (Closed bands are ignored in the generated code.)andP;  &quot;Quick layouts&quot;make it easy to create standard reports, or will at least give you a place tostart.andP;  Three quick layout types are offered.andP;  In Column Layout, fields arepositioned as in standard reports (dBASE III PLUS' only option).andP;  The FormLayout features fields positioned vertically, one record to a page, like in alist or data entry form.andP;  The Mailmerge Layout provides a quick set-up for amail merge/form letter operation, where the contents of database fields aremerged into printed output, complete with word wrap.andM;Standard headers and footers can be saved to and read from text files forquick retrieval into other reports.andP;  This is a simple but useful innovation.andO;Other innovations include features usually found only in word processors,like find and replace, and an adjustable ruler line with margins and tabsettings.andP;  Box and line drawing is also included, with single line, doubleline, and custom boxes.andM;One handy feature of the dBASE IV report writing environment is the macrorecording/playback feature also available throughout dBASE IV.andP;  By combiningkeyboard macros with word processing features, you can accomplish more workin less time.andM;Hidden fields can be used for calculations but won't be printed.andP;  Forexample, you can hide a count of records meeting certain criterion, thenprint it as a total at the end of the report.andM;You can bring in any dBASE object, such as memory variables, fields fromanother file, user-defined functions (UDFs), etc., but it's sometimes clumsy.andO;Most objects must be predefined so the pseudo-compiler/interpreter canevaluate them as valid expressions during report design.andP;  If UDFs are storedin a procedure file, you must open the file with the SET PROCEDURE TO commandbefore entering the report writing environment.andM;In order to choose fields from more than one file in the pick list, you mustfirst set up a VIEW or use the SET FIELDS TO command to include the fieldsyou need.andP;  Otherwise, the pick list dBASE IV presents is limited to fieldsfrom the selected file.andM;dBASE IV implements the report writer's output clumsily.andP;  The FRM file yougenerate is only used for future retrieval into the report writer.andP;  An FRGfile containing dBASE code is compiled into an FRO file, which can then beexecuted with the REPORT FORM command.andP;  A generated FRG/FRO file can't beexecuted with DO andless;frgnameandgt; unless you do some set-up and pass it fivespecific parameters.andP;  There's no doubt that this situation can be improvedthrough more versatile templates, but we don't know of any to date.andM;The translation between FRM design and FRG source code is accomplished byusing a template file that contains both dBASE language commands and commandswritten in a rather complicated template language.andP;  An in-depth discussion oftemplate languages is beyond the scope of this review.andP;  Suffice it to saythat a template is similar to a printer driver: It translates the objects onyour design screen to dBASE code, rather than printer control commands.andO;Since dBASE code is more complicated than printer control strings, dBASEtemplates are immensely more complex.andM;The template language implementation may be a good long-term move, but we'drather see optional code generation, with FRM files that work the way theyused to.andP;  (In prior versions of dBASE, REPORT FORM andless;frmnameandgt; acted like a&quot;built-in-runtime,&quot; generating output directly from the FRM file.)andP;  dBASEIV's code generation is weak, in that only one template name is recognized(REPORT.GEN).andP;  We hope future versions allow a choice from multipletemplates.andM;Another design weakness concerns the PRF files, which hold printer-specificinformation for a particular report.andP;  If you generate a report with specialprinter information, such as bold print or underlines, you might expect theFRM and FRG files to include these.andP;  That's not the case.andP;  Though the PRFfile shares its file name with the FRM/FRG/FRO files, it's not automaticallyrecognized the next time you run your report--you must specifically activateit with STORE andless;prfnameandgt; TO_pform before running the report.andP;  This relates toanother problem: LABLE FORMS have their own PRF files, again with matchingnames.andP;  Generating MYFORM.LBL creates MYFORM.PRF, overwriting the PRF fileyou created with MYFORM.FRM.andM;A couple of final gripesandM;When viewing output on the screen, there's no way to pan right or left forreports that exceed the 80-character width of the screen.andM;You must have at least 40K RAM free in dBASE IV 1.0 (you can test this usingMEMORY()) to generate FRG (source code) files.andP;  You'll need even more freememory for complicated reports involving related databases.andP;  Consideringversion 1.0's memory requirements, you may have problems generating reportsin a network environment.andM;Even with all its shortcomings, we still think dBASE IV's internal reportwriter is a milestone.andP;  With this report writer as the new standard, thecompetition should be spurred to even greater innovations.andM;Snow Report WriterandM;The Snow Report Writer is a comprehensive report writing system.andP;  BesidesdBASE files, Snow works with COBOL, BASIC, Pascal, and C files (many versionsof each), fixed and variable length ASCII files, Dataflex, Profile, and otherfile types specific to certain accounting packages (Macola, Real World,etc.).andP;  There's also an SCO Xenix version available (the version we reviewedwas for DOS).andM;Snow is strictly a stand-alone report writer for end users.andP;  There's noruntime module available.andP;  Its menu-driven interface is fairly easy to useand features a simple WYSIWYG layout editor (see Fig.andP;  2).andP;  The overall lookand feel is klutzy by today's standards, but you can get the job done.andP;  Youcan't drag objects around on the screen freely and once a field is placed inthe report layout, it isn't readily apparent what the field marker represents(fields are represented by strings of Xs).andM;Multi-file relationships are possible, although Snow doesn't use dBASE indexfiles, so several steps are necessary.andP;  You can work with DBF files directly;but Snow doesn't recognize memo fields and mistakenly prints out the contentsof the memo pointer in the DBF files.andP;  (This is actually a 10-byte field thatstores a numeric pointer into the DBT file in text form.)andM;On-line help is fairly comprehensive, and you can even define your own.andP;  Wefound some empty help boxes at certain points in the program.andP;  The manual iswell organized and complete.andP;  We couldn't find a &quot;Shell to DOS feature,&quot; anoption most DOS users take for granted.andM;Snow performs multi-level sorts and totals (up to nine levels deep), selectsrecords by specified criteria, does arithmetic operations, date conversion,and generally meets the needs of most reports.andP;  It supports up to sevenfonts, but they're sample strings of control characters that youspecify--Snow doesn't support printer drivers.andM;We see Snow's main advantage to dBASe users as its portability toenvironments where more than one filing system are used, such as XENIX/DOSshop.andP;  Why learn two or three report writers when one can access all yourfile types?andP;  dBASe developers have little to gain from Snow.andP;  It's anend-user tool for the most part.andP;  In cases where the user needs to accessfile types other than dBASE files, it seems well worth the money.andM;dNPL/ReporterandM;dNPL/Reporter, called the &quot;relational report writing system for dBASEapplications&quot; in its documentation, is the odd man out in this group.andP;  It'smore than a report writer and may well be misclassified completely.andO;Patterned after mainframe Focus (a database management system), it's afull-featured 4GL query language, similar to SQL in some ways, but with moreprocedural commands.andP;  (According to the author of the package, an SQL versionmay be available in the future.)andP;  Like SQL and other query languages,dNPL/Reporter's weakest point is limited data entry and validation.andP;  Addingthose features would make it almost a stand-alone database management system.andM;dNPL/Reporter is a powerful query tool, but requires some study to use andhas some important limitations as a dBASE reporting tool.andP;  No runtime moduleis available, nor does dNPL/Reporter generate dBASE source code.andP;  For thesereasons we judge dNPL/Reporter to be mostly an end-user tool, despite itsextensive programming capabilities.andP;  However, some end users may have a hardtime installing and learning the package without help.andM;One of dNPL/Reporter's drawbacks is limited output formatting.andP;  It doesn'tuse printer drivers and doesn't recognize memo fields.andP;  (Like the Snow ReportWriter, it prints them as if the memo pointer was a character string.)andM;dNPL/Reporter's user interface isn't extremely friendly or intuitive, andthere's no WYSIWYG interface.andP;  The system is built around a query language,which can be used interactively or by storing commands in text files likeprograms,  A primitive text editor is included in the package for editingcommand files.andP;  On-line help consists of half-screens of information, whichyou can toggle on or off while using the program.andM;dNPL/Reporter's syntax is quite different from dBASE language commands.andP;  Thismeans nothing to the end-user of a Clipper application who's never used dBASEinteractively, but some of us don't want to learn another language just toquery dBASE files.andP;  The language includes features not found in dBASE, butit's not as complete for developing applications.andP;  We especially like theACROSS qualifier (see Fig.andP;  3), which makes cross-tab summary reports simple.andO;We found it irritating that functions and commands similar to dBASE's werenamed differently.andP;  For instance, dNPL/Reporter's equivalent of the dBASEUPPER() Function is called UPPERCASE(), and the program uses a SET verb likedBASE's STORE.andP;  The SELECT verb is implemented differently than either dBASEor SQL.andP;  Focus users may be at home with this language, but it would beattractive to more users with dBASE and/or SQL command structures.andM;dNPL/Reporter's query language is enhanced with commands for usedinteraction.andP;  You can create pull-down menu systems and let another userselect the functions you prepare in advance.andP;  Pascal-like control structureslet you write lucid procedural code.andP;  The language also provides some dataentry functions but not for DBF files.andP;  Built-in functions are limited butuseful.andP;  UDFs aren't supported, although the procedural language is somewhatstrong enough to compensate for it.andM;dRandamp;G, a superset of (and separate product from) dNPL/Reporter, includes aruntime graphics module called GWIZ.andP;  dNPL/Reporter and GWIZ are actuallyseparate programs (the latter licensed from MIGHTYSOFT Corp.), and we foundthe interface between them weak.andP;  A third program is used to swap RAM todisk, freeing up enough memory for GWIZ to do graphics jobs.andP;  When thisdoesn't work, an error message flashes quickly, then disappears, butdNPL/Reporter isn't aware that GWIZ didn't load.andP;  The interface to thegraphics module requires writing graph data to a temporary text file.andP;  Thesetemporary text files aren't deleted automatically.andM;GWIZ creates a great variety of graph types (see the chart), and takesadvantage of high resolution graphics modes.andP;  You must reinstall GWIZ toswitch graphics modes.andP;  The highest-resolution modes also require largeamounts of free RAM (expanded memory isn't used).andP;  GWIZ includes many driversfor printers, plotters, and even film recorders and we found output qualityon the HP laser printer quite good.andM;dNPL includes more features than we had time to explore.andP;  It's undeniably apowerful product but we feel it needs more work in several areas:andM;* A more intuitive visual interfaceandM;* Mapping of dBASE and/or SQL commands to dNPL/Reporter's languageandM;* A more roburst help systemandM;And the interface with GWIZ needs to be smoothed out a little.andP;  (The authorsare reportedly working on this, and we expect the product to be improved bythe time you read this review.)andM;Randamp;R Report WriterandM;Randamp;R is the most powerful report writer available for dBASE files.andP;  Itout-classes all others by a wide margin.andP;  With many built-in functions andUDF libraries, Randamp;R can do just about anything you want it to.andP;  Extensiveprinter driver selection and up to eight pre-configured printer choices giveyou control and flexibility in printed output.andP;  Randamp;R also doeslabels--although it's not as easy to use as the dBASE IV LABEL FORM designsurface, it does have built-in label configurations for laser printers thatsimplify the job.andM;The royalty-free runtime package (included in the package) requires only 25K(plus 3K to 4k of DOS overhead), so it can run in almost any dBASE-languageenvironment--including dBASE IV.andP;  The pre-release (beta test stage) sourcecode generation program we examined generates source code from Randamp;R reportform files.andP;  Generating source code is optional, and it's done through aseparate module.andP;  No templates are used.andP;  The source code is clean and lucid,and automatically takes advantage of features of the dBASE dialect youchoose.andP;  The code generator produces dBASE IV, Clipper, and FoxBASE+ programfiles, and had been released just after this article was written.andM;Randamp;R's multi-file capabilities are impressive.andP;  You can build relations as youdesign the report.andP;  There are also query and sort-group options and createfilters and field groups.andP;  The sort-group table allows up to eightsort-grouping fields with ascending or descending order sorting for each.andO;Snow allows up to nine sort groups, but eight is more than enough for mostjobs.andP;  Randamp;R can create indexes or use the native index files of all majordBASE dialects (NDX, MDX, NTX, or IDX).andP;  An optional $49 module is requiredto support index files for Clipper and FoxBASE+.andM;Randamp;R emphasizes output versus input.andP;  The program suffers from a slightidentity crisis in its user interface.andP;  Randamp;R's menu structure is similar toLotus, but even avid 1-2-3 users many have difficulty guessing the correctkeystroke to perform the basic operations.andP;  For instance, to save a file inLotus you see &quot;/FS&quot;; in Randamp;R it's &quot;/RS (&quot;/F&quot; is used for fields).andM;Randamp;R does more than dBASE IV's report writer, but sometimes takes morekeystrokes for a simple task.andP;  For example, to insert a new header line intoa report requires five keystrokes (&quot;/LCH1&quot;).andP;  dBASE IV requires only onekeystroke per added line.andP;  dBASE IV also gets a higher WYSIWYG rating--Randamp;Ruses a good portion of the left side of the screen to tell you what each lineis (see Fig.andP;  4).andM;Randamp;R is also somewhat hampered by its inability to handle free-form text.andO;Everything on the screen is handled as a separate object, similar to FoxCodein FoxBASE+.andP;  You can't simply type words on the screen as you would with aword processor and move them around with the Ins and Del keys.andM;Another shortcoming is a lack of block commands in the visuall interface.andO;There's no way to select a block of text and/or fields and move them aroundthe screen.andP;  Each field or text object must be moved individually.andP;  Andthere's no command for copying text objects.andM;Although it's not as easy to use or learn as the dBASE IV report writer, Randamp;Ris a dedicated program for dBASE report writing, which gives it someadvantages over dBASE IV and the other report writers we reviewed.andP;  If youjust want sophisticated reporting from dBASE language files, this is the mostpowerful tool for the job.andM;SummaryandM;Which report writer is the one you need?andP;  All have their strengths andweaknesses.andP;  If you know Focus or feel more comfortable with the 4GLapproach, dNPL/Reporter is for you.andP;  This package may also find fans amongpower users who aren't afraid to learn a new command syntax and who want todo frequent queries with a few keystrokes.andP;  The dRandamp;G graphics option providesan upgrade path to presentation-quality graphics.andM;If you need to query many different file types with the same report writer,Snow Report Writer is an excellent choice.andP;  Although it doesn't support memofields or printer drivers, Snow is a solid program for most reporting needs.andM;For ease of use and integration (more or less), dBASE IV's report writer isoutstanding.andP;  You have to buy the farm to get this horse though--the reportwriter is only available as part of dBASE IV.andP;  You'll need a high-end machinewith plenty of available RAM, and lots of patience to deal with the multitudeof minor quirks in dBASE IV version 1.0.andM;For all-around power, extensive printer support, and implementation acrossdBASE platforms, Randamp;R Relational Report Writer is the undisputed champion.andO;Runtime modules, broad support for dBASE-style indexes, source codegeneration, UDFs, numerous built-in functions, and many other features makethis program our overall choice for almost any dBASE report writing need.andM;PricesandM;The dBASE IV Report Writer is part of dBASE IV ($795) and is available fromAshton-Tate, 20101 Hamilton Ave., Torrance, Calif.andP;
