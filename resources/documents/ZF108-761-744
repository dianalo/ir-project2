(Varian Associates Inc.'s VRC PR-6C solar-cell arrays)(product announcement)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Bursky, Dave.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Varian Associates Inc has developed a miniature multisectionedsolar-cell array that overcomes the problem of separate powersupplies to the isolated subsystems offered by fiber-opticalcoupling.andP;  Use of the solar cells measuring only a few millimetersin diameter allows laser-light power injected at one end of afiber-optic cable to be converted back to electrical power at thereceiving end.andP;  Conversion efficiency of between 40 and 50 percentcan be achieved by the gallium arsenide solar cells through theclose coupling of the fiber to the cells; the array is optimizedfor use with laser diodes having optical power wavelengths ofbetween 800 and 850 nanometers.andP;  Cells in the circular array areformed and isolated from each other by 20- to 30-micron-deeptrenches etched in the GaAs buffer layer with reactive-ionetching; each cell produces about 1 V and 100 mA, and from one to12 cells can be formed on a chip.andP;  The VRC PR-6C solar-cell arraycosts $250 each in small quantities, but the price could drop to$10 in large production quantities.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Varian Associates Inc.
