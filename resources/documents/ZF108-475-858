(one of two multiplatform word processingpackages evaluated) (Software Review) (evaluation)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Catchings, Bill; Van Name, Mark L.; Schroeder, Erica.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Microsoft Corp's Word is one of two software packages that offerversions for not only MS-DOS and OS/2 machines, but for theMacintosh as well.andP;  The word processing software is evaluated onthe uniformity of its user interfaces between platforms and on theease with which files can be transferred between platforms.andP;  Thepackage receives a weighted score of 8.6 out of 10, and is anoverall good buy.andP;  The OS/2 and DOS versions of the software areidentical, with the same look and feel and exactly the same fileformats.andP;  The Macintosh version has different features and adifferent graphical user interface.andP;  Moving files between the OS/2and DOS versions requires no work at all.andP;  Moving between theMacintosh and the OS/2 or DOS systems is also easy, requiring onlythat the computer convert the file which retains the sameformatting information.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Microsoft Corp. (products).andO;Ticker:    MSFT.andO;Product:   Microsoft Word 4.0 (Word processing software).andO;Topic:     Word processing softwareEvaluationCompatible Software.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Microsoft Corp.andM;WORDandM;Microsoft Word offers users of both the Mac and PC a powerful array ofword-processing features.andM;Its DOS, OS/2 and Mac versions also score well in compatibility.andP;  In fact,the DOS and OS/2 versions, 5.0, are the same.andP;  A single shrink-wrappedproduct can run under either DOS or OS/2; the same program file even runs inboth environments.andM;In addition to saving Microsoft production costs, this single version meansthat the two products are as compatible as the DOS and OS/2 operating systemsallow.andP;  They look and act the same, and they use exactly the same fileformats.andM;The Macintosh version of Word, however, is very different.andP;  Its 4.0 versionnumber correctly indicates that it is older than the PC product.andP;  It lacksglossaries, and it also supports fewer levels of styles than the PC version.andO;The 4.0 number is also deceiving: The Mac product does not offer exactly thesame features as version 4.0 of the PC product.andP;  Its graphical user interfacegives it a very different feel from that of the PC products.andM;Both the PC and Mac user interfaces are fairly intuitive and very easy tocustomize.andP;  The Mac version follows the standard Mac user-interfaceconventions.andP;  The PC versions, by default, display menus on the bottom of thescreen.andP;  Both versions support a mouse.andM;It is also easy to transfer files among these versions.andP;  PC Week tested thefile-transfer options by exchanging files among all three versions.andP;  Becausethe DOS and OS/2 versions use the same file format, moving files between themrequired no work.andM;File transfer between the Mac and PC versions was almost as easy.andP;  Once a PCfile is on the Mac, the user simply opens that file.andP;  Word for the Macintoshautomatically detects that the file came from PC Word, asks the user if thereis a PC Word style sheet for the document, and then automatically convertsthe document to Mac Word's format.andP;  The resulting Macintosh file retains theformatting information of the original PC file.andM;Translating a Mac Word file into PC Word format is only a bit harder: Theuser must save the file in PC Word format.andP;  PC Word can then read that file,which will have its formatting information intact.andM;These options, like the rest of Word, are relatively easy to learn and use.andO;A strong tutorial teaches the main concepts quickly, although learning allthe features of Word requires much more time.andP;  A context-sensitive on-linehelp facility is a boon to novice users.andM;The extensive documentation is generally good.andP;  Its biggest problem is sheervolume: The DOS (and OS/2) product has nearly 1,300 pages in four books, andthe Mac version has more than 600 pages in two volumes.andM;Word's printer support is excellent.andP;  It has drivers for every commonprinter, including PostScript printers, and many obscure ones as well.andM;Microsoft Corp., of Redmond, Wash., can be reached at (800) 426-9400 or (206)882-8080.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;&quot;A few formatting features don't translate to the Mac -- Mac [Word] does notrecognize all options such as dual bins that the NEC [printers] have, whereasthe PC recognizes all options,&quot; said Jeff Haverstock, professional supportanalyst for Visa International, in San Mateo, Calif., who uses Word on PS/2sand Macs.andP;  He uses NEC America Information Systems Inc.'s Silentwriter LC-890and Silentwriter/2 290 PostScript printers.andM;Pasting graphics into Mac Word documents is easier than into the DOS versiondue to on-screen presentation of graphics, according to Haverstock.andO;&quot;Text-formatting features [are] better on the Mac.andP;  It's easier to flow textaround graphics,&quot; he said.andM;Gery Eyer, office systems coordinator for Roam andamp; Haas Co., a chemicalmanufacturer in Spring House, Pa., agreed that the graphics capabilities ofWord on the Mac are easier to use than on the DOS version.andP;  Eyer reportedthat preparing the newsletter in Word was easier than working in AldusCorp.'s PageMaker, which she also has on her Mac IIcx.andM;Given a choice, most of Eyer's employees chose the Mac version of Word overthe IBM-compatible release, she said.andP;  &quot;Word for the PC is not the bestanimal.andP;  The Mac appears to be so much easier.andP;  [It] is intuitively nicer,&quot;said Eyer.andM;According to Eyer, the envelope feeder of her Dataproducts Corp. LZR1260printer did not work with either version of Word, but officials at neitherMicrosoft nor Dataproducts could identify the problem.andM;The documentation for the DOS version is too confusing and difficult to referto quickly for simple solutions, she added.andP;  &quot;But the on-line help [for DOS]is terrific, and the Mac is better,&quot; Eyer said.andM;Eyer's primary complaint with Word is poor support from Microsoft.andO;&quot;Sometimes I call them back three hours later with the answer to a problem Ihad,&quot; she said.andP;  In addition, graphics imported to Word's DOS version areinvisible, she claimed.andM;Despite her dissatisfaction with Word, Eyer vetoed WordPerfect because it wasincompatible with the RFT format.andM;Hugh Laurence, a lawyer with the Toronto law firm of Fasken, Campbell,Godfrey, who uses Mac Word, found the documentation reasonablywell-organized.andP;  &quot;For a Mac program, Word is complicated because it has somany functions.andP;  But, for a word processor it's easy,&quot; he noted.andM;&quot;I could never figure out columns,&quot; said Laurence.andP;  &quot;The table feature isannoying.andP;  For example, I haven't been able to figure out how to change acolumn width from 2 inches to 1.5 inches.andP;  Features like that are notintuitive.&quot;andM;</TEXT></DOC>
