''</NOTE><HEAD>LaserPhoto NY5</HEAD><BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Interior Ministry today closeddown the Roman Catholic Church's radio station, accusing it of``inciting to violence, disorder and lack of respect forconstitutional government.''   Monsignor Bismarck Carballo, director of Radio Catolica, toldThe Associated Press the order was ``unjust and arbitrary.''   On Sunday, police used tear gas and beat protesters to break upan anti-government demonstration by about 10,000 people. PresidentDaniel Ortega said the rally was part of a U.S. plan to destabilizethe leftist Sandinista government.   An official in the Interior Ministry's press office, who spokeon condition of anonymity, said the radio station was ordered shutdown because of its broadcasts about the demonstration.   Carballo said, however, ``all stations in the country reportedyesterday about those events.''   ``What most concerns us that in our programming yesterday werepeated a pastoral letter from the bishops issued June 29 and ahomily by Cardinal Miguel Obando in which `the right of the peopleto civic protest' is defended,'' the monsignor said.   Obando y Bravo, who has been a leading critic of the Sandinistasin their nine years of rule, delivered his homily Sunday.   Radio Catolica was closed by the government on Jan. 10, 1986. Itwas allowed to reopen last September under the Central Americanpeace agreement signed by Ortega and the region's four otherpresidents in August.   Its news programs were closed for brief periods on June 2 andJune 10.   Meanwhile, Miriam Arguello, leader of the oppositionConservative Party, was detained by police during the night. TheInterior Ministry official said she was accused of being ``theprincipal instigator of yesterday's events in Nandaime.''   Sunday's anti-government rally, one of the largest ever inNicaragua, was held in Nandaime, a small city 40 miles south ofManagua.   Ten police officers were injured and at least 38 people arrestedin the confrontation, the official Voice of Nicaragua said. It didnot say how many protesters were hurt.   The opposition said three of its leaders were arrested.   ``This is to show the people want democracy,'' protester MyriamArguello, secretary-general of the anti-government ConservativeParty, said just minutes before the demonstration turned into amelee.   Ortega told reporters afterward that his leftist governmentwould act ``with total firmness'' against protesters.   ``We cannot continue being tolerant with those who want to takeadvantage of the (political) space,'' he said, referring to recentfreedoms accorded anti-government groups in Nicaragua.   He said the demonstration was part of a U.S. plan to destabilizethe government.   Ortega made the comments after visiting the family of aSandinista Youth organization member authorities said was killedSaturday when the car he was riding in was ambushed by U.S.-backedContra rebels.   The violence began after protesters, some carrying signs thatread, ``Democracy Yes, Communism No,'' marched several blocks alongNandaime's mud-covered streets to gather in an open field forspeeches.   Scores of police with gas masks and AK-47 rifles stood guardnearby.   ``We're here to make sure that order is kept,'' an officer said.   Witnesses said people began screaming and running for cover whenpolice began lobbing tear-gas canisters into the crowd.   Groups of protesters hurled stones and sticks back at theofficers, and one man yelled: ``You murderous dogs!''   Police beat several people with their fists, feet and riflebutts. One man stood stunned, blood dripping down his face, hisarms cut.   Witnesses said police threw one of the rally organizers, CarlosHuembes, to the ground, then punched and kicked him.   Plainclothes security agents confiscated film from severalphotographers, including one from The Associated Press.   Police used the tear gas after protesters began hurling rocks, astate security officer told the AP.   The demonstration was organized by the Democratic Coordinate, anumbrella group for anti-government political parties and tradeorganizations. It was authorized by the government, which stagedits own pro-Sandinista rally in the town over the weekend.   Roger Guevara, secretary of the Coordinate, said in a statementthat Huembes and two other Coordinate members arrested at the rallywere being detained Sunday night. The statement identified them asAgustin Jarquin Anaya and Adan Fletes of the Social Christian party.   Public discontent with the Sandinistas has increased this yearas Nicaragua's economy worsens and the government's war against theContras remains unsettled.   The government claims the Reagan administration, its lastrequest for renewed military aid to the Contras killed by Congressin February, has been attempting to stir up discontent in Nicaragua.   The Sandinista government was established in July 1979 after acivil war toppled the rightist government of Anastasio Somoza.   The U.S.-backed rebels have been fighting the government fornearly seven years. But they signed a preliminary peace accord onMarch 23 and have since held several rounds of talks aimed atforging a lasting peace.   A tenuous cease-fire remains in effect as the two sidesnegotiate conditions for future talks.</TEXT></DOC>
