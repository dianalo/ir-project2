Bush ordered F-4 fighters from Clark Air Force Base to provideair support and to prevent aircraft from taking off from twoPhilippine air bases held by rebels. A contingent of 100 Marineswas also sent from a U.S. base in the Philippines to help protectthe U.S. embassy compound in Manila.   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said that noU.S. planes had ``fired any shots or intercepted any rebelaircraft.'' Rear Adm. Edward Sheafer of the Defense IntelligenceAgency said ``the goverment forces seem to be prevailing'' in thestruggle with the rebels.   ``We are hopeful the situation will be contained,'' Bush toldreporters soon after arriving here for his weekend summit withSoviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   ``It is fair to say that the situation is serious,'' Secretaryof State James A. Baker III added. ``We have provided some airsupport, air cover.'' He sa id that what the Aquino government hadasked for.   Bush ordered the air support to help protect the Aquinogovernment during his overnight flight here from Washington aboardAir Force One. The quick help came in response to a request fromAquino, who spoke by telephone with Vice President Dan Quayle inWashington.   The president received updates on the situation from hisnational security adviser, Brent Scowcroft. Bush was toldgovernment forces had retaken one air field and that trouble spotswere being cleaned up, but the coup attempt was still in progress,Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement.   The president's decision to grant U.S. military aid camequickly, just hours after rebels bombed the presidential palace inManila in the most serious effort to oust Aquino since she came topower in 1986. Bush had come under some criticism _ principallyfrom Democrats in Congress _ for not acting more decisively intaking advantage of September's failed coup attempt againstPanamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.   Deputy White House press secretary Roman Popadiuk said Bush'sdecision to intervene was twofold: ``A democratic government hasasked for assistance; We have American lives to protect.'' He saidAquino was ``in a safe place'' but he wouldn't say where, and thatthe U.S. planes were still flying into the early morning hours inthe Philippines.   Bush's decision won strong bipartisan support from members ofCongress. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, calledit ``prudent and in our national interest.''   The president looked tired, and while he told reporters he wasready for the weekend summit with Gorbachev, the threat to thefriendly government in Manila appeared to dampen his spirits on arainy day.   Before a session with Maltese Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami,Bush said that Mrs. Aquino ``sounded fine'' when she took atelephone call from Quayle in Washington.   Still, even limited U.S. military intervention could damage thecomplaint Bush planned to lodge with Gorbachev about a continuingflow of Soviet weapons to rebels in El Salvador.   The United States charges delivery of the arms, includinganti-aircraft launchers, by Cuba and Nicaragua are only one exampleof Soviet mischief-making in the Third World.   Arkady Maslennikov, a spokesman for the Supreme Soviet,criticized Bush's decision to order air support. ``We are againstsuch an interference. Any interference in internal developments,especially by outside powers, is destructive and leads toideterioratio of the situation.''   ``In any event, the best thing is to allow the Filipiosthemselves to sort it out,'' he said.   Fitzwater indirectly acknowledged that the U.S. actions amountedto intervention. He said: ``If the tide is turning and the coup isbeginning to die out there would be no need for furtherintervention.''   Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, said U.S. forces``were not in the thick of anything. They are simply providing aircover. That's all we have been requested to do.''   In a statement issued from Air Force One as Bush flew to thisisland nation, Fitzwater said Mrs. Aquino had requested the U.S.military assistance.   ``This assistance is intended to allow the democraticallyelected government of the Philippines to restore order. Thepresident also is determined to protect the lives of Americans inthe Philippines,'' his statement said.   Mrs. Aquino, in Manila, said, ``Even now, U.S. fighters arejoining the fight to give air cover to our ground troops. Oncemore, two Pacific democracies stand shoulder-to-shoulder in thedefense of freedom.''   A Bush administration official said the U.S. fighters wereauthorized to fire ``only if (rebel) planes are attempting to takeoff from these two bases, but that would be only after repeatedwarnings.''   The Reagan and Bush administrations gradually increased U.S.assistance to the Philippines as a means of bolstering Mrs. Aquinoin a country beset by grinding poverty. The United States maintainstwo bases in the Philippines, the vast Subic Bay naval base andClark air base.   Meanwhile, the CIA has reported that some senior Philippineofficials are worried that entire segments of their armed forcessupposedly loyal to Aquino will fail to ``fight effectively'' infending off the rebels attempting to topple her government, anadministration source reported today.   The Central Intelligence Agency, in its daily intellgencesummary prepared for top U.S. officials, reported on Friday thatthe situation in the Philippines was ``quite uncertain,'' said theofficial, speaking on condition he not be identified by name.</TEXT></DOC>
