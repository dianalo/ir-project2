The Roman Catholic bishop of Down and Connor, the Right Rev.Cahal Daly, and the Anglican bishop of Connor, the Right Rev. SamuelPoyntz, both said dwelling on the past only prolongs frictionbetween Protestants and Catholics.   A week ago, Protestants converged on Londonderry to mark the300th anniversary of a victory over the forces of the Catholic KingJames II.   Supporters of the mainly Catholic IRA marched in Belfast and inLondonderry to mark the 20th anniversary of the deployment ofBritish troops and the 18th anniversary of the long-discardedBritish policy of detaining terrorist suspects without trial.   ``If we continue to dwell on the past, there can only be acontinuation of the misery-go-round,'' said Poyntz, who called lastweek for both sides to agree to a date for calling off theanniversary celebrations.   ``Is it possible for us to leave the commemoration of past eventsbehind, at least until the situation has cooled down, and instead toemphasize the opportunities of the present and the future?'' Poyntzsaid.   ``It is time to move on from this continual reliving of the past.It is time to move forward,'' Daly said, following a visit with theparents of a 15-year-old boy killed by a plastic bullet during adisturbance.   The anniversaries ``are looked forward to with apprehension andfear by local communities that are held to ransom,'' the Catholicbishop said.   It was the Protestant march in Londonderry 20 years ago thatprovoked violence that led to the troops being called in.   At the march in Londonderry organized by Sinn Fein, the legalwing of the IRA, the wing's publicity director Danny Morrisonscoffed at the bishops' appeal.   ``I don't mean to offend anybody at all, but bishops sayingthey're against commemorations?'' Morrison said. ``Is there anybodycommemorates things more often than bishops? What's going to gonext, Christmas?''   Protestant marches celebrate past triumphs and wave the BritishUnion Jack. Republican parades honor the martyrs of the cause of aunited Ireland free of Britain, and proceed under the orange, whiteand green flag of Ireland.   These celebrations recall what the English writer WilliamMakepeace Thackeray observed in the 19th century: ``To have anopinion about Ireland, one must begin by getting at the truth, andwhere is it to be had in the country? Or rather, there are twotruths, the Catholic truth and the Protestant truth. Belief is madea party business.''   Aug. 12 holds an importance on the Protestant calendar secondonly to July 12, celebrated as the victory of the Protestant Williamof Orange over James II. The 300th anniversary is next year; in1991, it's 300 years since William whipped James again at the battleof Aughrim.   Nelson McCausland, a Protestant member of the Belfast citycouncil, said the loyalist celebrations commemorated the defense ofcivil and religious liberty.   ``By contrast, the republican demonstrations are organized bythose whose business is murder and destruction,'' McCausland said.   Paul Arthur, a lecturer at the University of Ulster, wrote in TheIrish Times of Dublin that ``it is difficult to exaggerate thedamage done to the political process by these `celebrations'.''   ``They are not cathartic, but serve to live on another man'swounds.'' Arthur recalled the words of a poem written in the contextof one of Northern Ireland's many republican campaigns: ``These arethe martyrs @ Who die for a future buried in thepast.'''</TEXT></DOC>
