<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-91-0593 </DOCNO><TEXT>The nonlinear evolution of a force-free magnetic field driven by slowshear flow on a boundary is investigated analytically and numerically.The Woltjer-Taylor theory is generalized to obtain the time-dependentmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solution for the nonlinear force-free fieldsdriven by shear flow. This solution agrees well with our resistive MHDsimulations, which show that the force-free arcade field in a solar coronalplasma evolves quasi-statically through a series of force-free statesbefore reconnection occurs. 14 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
