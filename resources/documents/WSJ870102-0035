For all of 1986, municipal bond issuance fell 28% to $143.5 billion from the 1985 total, according to IDD Information Services/PSA.    During much of 1985 and the first nine months of 1986, state and local governments raced to issue revenue bonds before tax-overhaul restrictions on municipal debt took effect. Restrictions to be imposed by tax reform prompted an increase not only in tax-exempt revenue bond issues but also in taxable municipal bonds.    Issuance of taxable municipal bonds, securities that didn't exist three years ago, grew to $3.96 billion from $300 million in 1985. State and local governments generally used taxable issues to finance projects, such as agricultural loans and aid to small businesses, that won't be allowed tax-exempt funding under the tax bill. Taxable issues accounted for 2.8% of all municipal financings in 1986.    Commercial banks, which had been busy underwriters in the first half of 1986 as general obligation bond issuance dominated the market, dropped sharply in activity for the year because of the increase in revenue bond debt. No commercial banks were on the list of the top 10 underwriters issued by IDD/PSA.    In total municipal new-issue volume, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets ranked first, with 319 new issues totaling $13.79 billion, according to IDD/PSA. Salomon Brothers Inc. came in second, with 121 issues totaling $13.52 billion. At the end of the first six months, their positions had been reversed.    Both firms' market shares, which had fallen in the third quarter, rebounded slightly in the fourth quarter. Merrill Lynch's inched up to 9.6% from 9.5%, and Salomon Brothers' moved up to 9.4% from 9.3%.    Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. retained the third-place position it held at the end of the third quarter. The firm served as lead manager on 113 issues totaling $11.74 billion, for an 8.2% market share.    Of total municipal bonds issued in 1986, $47.17 billion was general obligation debt and $96.37 billion was revenue bond debt, according to Securities Data Corp.    Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. dominated the field in the taxable sector, capturing a 46.1% market share, with 11 issues totaling $1.73 billion. Its nearest competitor was First Boston Corp., with four issues totaling $570 million for a 15.2% market share, according to Securities Data.    The following were the leading underwriters of municipal bonds in 1986, according to IDD/PSA.
