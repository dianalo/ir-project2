They also held out the threat of further congressional action if the labor-management acrimony doesn't begin easing soon at Eastern Airlines, a Texas Air unit.    Meanwhile, another Texas Air unit, Continental Airlines, said it will record a $131 million charge against second-quarter earnings to reflect previously underestimated liabilities.    The unit said the charges involve so-called air-traffic liabilities that the carrier failed to provide for in late 1987 and early 1988 due to inadequate accounting.    Air-traffic liabilities mostly involve tickets that have been sold and not yet flown upon. But Continental's second-quarter charge also includes $64 million of previously unaccounted-for liabilities for the cost of having other airlines accommodate stranded passengers.    The three congressmen -- Rep. Glenn Anderson (D., Calif.), chairman of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee; Rep. Norman Mineta (D., Calif.), chairman of the House aviation subcommittee; and Rep. Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.), ranking Republican on the aviation subcommittee -- made their remarks in a letter to Transportation Secretary James Burnley.    Earlier this month, after a six-week investigation, the department concluded that Texas Air is fit to run an airline and that Eastern is operating safely. But it warned that labor-management hostility at the airline increased safety risks and limited the airline's ability to improve its compliance with safety rules. Mr. Burnley asked William Brock, a former labor secretary, to hold talks between labor and management to try to prevent the dispute from threatening safety. In their letter, the congressmen complained that the investigation didn't focus on &quot;broader public interest questions,&quot; such as whether Texas Air mistreats its employees and whether the proposed sale of the Eastern shuttle was intended to scare employees into making pay concessions.    Despite their dissatisfaction, the congressmen said they will postpone action on a resolution instructing the department to conduct a broader, more detailed investigation into Texas Air and Eastern.    The postponement is designed to give Mr. Brock a chance to diffuse acrimony at Eastern, the congressmen said. But they warned that if Mr. Brock doesn't make progress, they will pass the resolution -- either in its current form or in a new version -- or hold hearings about problems at Eastern and Texas Air.    A spokesman for the Transportation Department said Mr. Burnley hadn't seen the letter and didn't have any comment.    In Houston, Continental said the extent of the underestimated liabilities, and the company's failure to account for them fully as they were incurred, reflect the carrier's rapid expansion in 1987. &quot;You've got newer people in all kinds of areas, including the accounting function,&quot; a Continental spokesman said. &quot;This involves the problems of integration and growth,&quot; as well as the flight delays and cancellations caused by severe weather at Continental's Denver hub last winter.    Texas Air pointed out that the revised liability estimates &quot;do not have any impact on the current or future cash levels of Continental.&quot; The parent company also said it expects Continental to be profitable in the second half.    It wasn't clear what effect the charge against Continental's earnings would have on Texas Air's consolidated results for the second quarter. For the year-ago quarter, Texas Air reported a net loss of $27 million on revenue of $2.16 billion.    A number of airlines over the years have had to record charges -- or, in at least one case, a special gain --as a result of revising their air-traffic liability estimates. Seldom, however, do such revisions range as high as Continental's.    Although Continental's air-traffic liability figure began plunging in the fourth quarter of 1987, it wasn't until the sum fell further, in the first quarter, that the company's accountants grew concerned.    A special audit was ordered. &quot;Only in the last several days was the magnitude revealed,&quot; the spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
