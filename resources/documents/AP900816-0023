One of the ground rules prevents journalists from disclosing thesize of troop units or where they are located in the desert in thedispatches that are shared with the nation's news media on a``pool'' basis.   ``That's the kind of stuff the Iraqis would love to know ... Youmight as well be giving them grid coordinates to set theirartillery for,'' a Pentagon official said Wednesday. He asked toremain unidentified.   Another restriction on the 15-member pool of U.S. journalists,flown to Saudi Arabia by the Pentagon over the weekend, prohibitsthem from identifying individual soldiers _ except command-levelofficers _ by name.   That rule is in place to protect the GIs' families in the UnitedStates, the Pentagon official said.   ``You have people who don't much care for the fact that we'rethere in the first place and who want to strike back at a target,''he said.   Photographers are not prevented from taking pictures of anythingthey see, but a group of U.S. military ``escorts'' control wherethe pool reporters and photographers are taken each day.   A military official does a ``security review'' of the storiesbefore they are dispatched to the reporter's Washington bureau.Then a Pentagon official in Washington gives it a final reviewbefore it is allowed to be distributed by wire services and toother news organizations.   The Defense Department pool in Saudi Arabia includes seven printreporters _ one each from The Associated Press, the Los AngelesTimes, Scripps Howard News Service, the Milwaukee Journal, UnitedPress International, Reuters and Time magazine.   It also includes a National Public Radio reporter, stillphotographers from the AP, UPI and Time and a CNN television crew.</TEXT></DOC>
