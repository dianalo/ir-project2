Ten years after the mostcontroversial redirection of U.S. economic policy sinceFranklin D. Roosevelt, the facts are in, and we can assessthe results.   The promise of the supply-side program -- that it wouldrescue the economy from stagflation and permit growth withoutrising rates of inflation -- has been achieved. Havingenjoyed the longest peacetime expansion on record with aninflation rate that averaged half that of the previousdecade, it is easy to forget just how controversial thispromise was in 1981.</LP><TEXT>   In those days the &quot;Phillips curve&quot; and its crueltrade-offs between growth and inflation dominated economicthinking. The supply-side claim that stagflation resultedfrom the mix of easy money that pumped up demand with taxesand regulation that strangled output was dismissed by mosteconomists. Generally, economists viewed the 1981 tax cuts asan application of demand stimulus to an inflation-proneeconomy already suffering from a $70 billion deficit andrising double-digit inflation and interest rates. Theypredicted that the tax cuts would lead to excessiveconsumption and debt, higher inflation, deindustrializationand an inability to compete with other countries.   Orthodox economists believed that the irresponsible taxcuts meant the Fed would find it hard to restrain inflation.Prof. Stanley Fischer of the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology told the board of governors of the Federal Reservein May 1983, just as the economy was coming out of recession,that &quot;if the Fed is determined to preserve its gains in thefight against inflation, it will have to run the risk ofcreating another recession fairly soon.&quot; Mr. Fischer told theboard that the proper conduct of monetary policy means that&quot;the prospect for the 1980s is that the decade will look muchlike the 1950s, with concern over inflation dominatingmonetary policy and ensuring several recessions.&quot; To keep allthis tight money from raising interest rates, he recommendedfiscal austerity to reduce budget deficits.   The general attitude, reflected even in the top level ofthe Reagan administration, was that sooner rather than laterPresident Reagan would have to realize that the tax cuts werea mistake and repeal them. This expectation died hard, thoughnot without producing several growth-killing tax increasesover the decade, none of which reduced the deficit.   The disappointing results of tax hikes, together with theevidence collected in books such as Lawrence B. Lindsey's&quot;The Growth Experiment,&quot; have left the Laffer curve with morecredibility than the government's static revenue estimates.Mr. Lindsey calculates that the economic activity unleashedby the 1981 tax cuts recovered 70% of the revenues lost bythe lowering of tax rates. During the 1980 presidentialcampaign, Mr. Reagan had predicted that the tax cuts wouldrecover 17% of the revenues. Whatever the actual revenuesrecovered, we do know from the lengthy expansion thatfollowed Kemp-Roth that revenue gain from the tax cuts atleast exceeded the zero amount assumed in the static revenueforecast that was the basis for the original 1981-85 budgetplan.   All of the propagandistic claims of supply-side failurethat dominated the economic news for a decade have been laidto rest. We know for certain that the U.S. did not disinvest,did not suffer declining productivity growth, did not becomeuncompetitive, did not create primarily dead-end, low-skilledjobs and did not experience declining real family income inthe 1980s.                                                                                                          Manufacturing: Prompted by criticisms from economists thatU.S. government statistics were failing to detect a weakeningin the nation's industrial base, the Commerce Departmentundertook a 2 1/2 year study of American manufacturing. Thestudy, released earlier this year, shows that the 1980s wereyears of an almost unbelievable revival by U.S. industry.   In a front-page story that must have been galling for thatpaper's editorial writers, the New York Times reported onFeb. 5 that the rate of U.S. manufacturing productivitygrowth had tripled during the 1980s and now was on a par withJapan and Europe, and that manufacturing's share of GNP hadrebounded to the &quot;level of output achieved in the 1960s whenAmerican factories hummed at a feverish clip.&quot; Far fromlosing its competitiveness, the report revealed that the U.S.had experienced an unprecedented export boom.   Investment: The illusion of the U.S. as a disinvestingnation was created by measuring investment in net nominalterms, without either adjusting for inflation or for shiftsin the composition of investment. During the 1980s, prices ofcapital goods in the U.S. rose only about half as fast as theoverall U.S. inflation rate. Unless an inflation-adjustedmeasure of investment is used, the decline in the relativeprices of capital goods can be misinterpreted as a fall ininvestment's share of gross national product.   Measuring investment net of depreciation or replacement ofthe capital used in production has the same result. On thesurface net investment seems to be a more reliable measurethan gross investment. However, net investment fails to makeany adjustment for the shift in the composition of investmentfrom longer-lived assets, such as buildings, to shorter-livedassets, such as equipment, that generate more rapiddepreciation. Net investment has been falling as a share ofU.S. GNP for the past 25 years as a result of a rise in thedepreciation rate, corresponding to a 25% increase inequipment's share of investment. By misinterpreting a changein asset mix as a decline in investment, economists painted afalse picture of disinvestment.   When the appropriate adjustments are made, realinvestment's share of GNP in the 1980s was unprecedented inthe postwar era.                                                                                                          Saving Rate: Even the fabled gap between U.S. and Japanesesaving rates turned out to be a mismeasurement. In the spring1989 &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; of the Federal Reserve Bank ofMinneapolis, Fumio Hayashi points out that &quot;the apparentsavings-rate gap between Japan and the U.S. is a statisticalillusion attributable to differences in the way the twocountries compile their national income accounts.&quot;   Japan values depreciation at historical cost rather thanat the higher replacement-cost figure that the U.S. uses. Inaddition, the U.S. counts investments such as roads, bridges,schools and warships as consumption, whereas Japan countsthem as investments. Mr. Hayashi reports that once theaccounting systems are put on an equal footing, thenotoriously wide difference in the savings rate disappears.                                                                                                          Jobs: The charge that Reaganomics had created a nation ofhamburger-flippers was destroyed in 1988 when the Bureau ofLabor Statistics reported that the percentage of new jobs inthe higher-skilled categories was much larger in the 1980sthan in the 1970s. The commissioner of the bureau, Janet L.Norwood, testified before Congress in August 1988 thatlow-skilled jobs are &quot;not growing as fast as those thatrequire a lot of training.&quot; The Reagan expansion createdskilled jobs at a more rapid pace than our educational systemcould produce people to fill them.                                                                                                          Family Income: To paint a picture of the rich gettingricher as the poor get poorer, the partisan CongressionalBudget Office and a bevy of Democratic economists had to useunadjusted Census data to construct a measure of &quot;average&quot;family income biased by rising divorce rates and the growthin single-parent households. What these critics discoveredwas the effect of the decline of the institution of marriageon family income.   Another trick, used by MIT's Paul Krugman, is to taint Mr.Reagan's record with that of Jimmy Carter. To show the poorbecoming poorer under Reagan, Mr. Krugman selects the period1979-87. This averages only four years of the Reaganexpansion with the drop in median income associated with thelast two years of the Carter stagflation and the 1981-82Volcker recession.                                                                                                          Social Security: Some accuse Mr. Reagan of paying for cutsin progressive income tax rates with increases in the&quot;regressive&quot; Social Security tax. It is true that thecombined tax changes were less favorable to the poor than theincome tax changes alone. Where the allegation goes wrong isin blaming the higher Social Security taxes on Mr. Reagan.The bulk -- 86% to be precise -- of the increase in payrolltaxes during the 1980s was legislated in 1977. Automaticincreases in the Social Security tax rate for 1981, 1982,1985, 1986 and 1990 were already scheduled before Mr. Reaganbecame president.   Former Treasury economists Gary and Aldona Robbins havecalculated that including the Social Security tax increases,the tax burden on a $10,000 income in 1990 is still 42% lessthan it would have been without the 1981 income tax cuts, anda $30,000 income is taxed 40% less.                                                                                                          Debt: Finally, there is the matter of debt. There is nodoubt that private and public debt is larger today than whenMr. Reagan took office. But as Morgan Stanley's chiefeconomist, John Paulus, pointed out on this page on July 19,it is normal for debt to grow with income. Moreover, duringthe 1980s both non-financial corporations and householdsadded more to their assets than to their debts, so their networths rose.   It is above all the increase in wealth during the Reaganyears that removed the basis for the predictions of economiccollapse. In the end, these predictions stand as expressionsof nothing more than frustration with Mr. Reagan's success.   ---   Mr. Roberts, then chief economist for the Republicanminority on the House Budget Committee, drafted the originalKemp-Roth bill in 1977.</TEXT></DOC>
