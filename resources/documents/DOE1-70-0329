The test results have demonstrated the general conformanceof the cylinders to their design criteria. Several of the test cylinderswere taken from active service. A few were made available as the resultof handling mishaps: These were a dented 48-inch cylinder and two type30B cylinders damaged in a warehouse fire. The tests have shown thatthe stiffening ring butt weld serves to localize the failure of the 48-inchcylinders, with an associated penalty in ultimate pressure. They havealso shown the extreme conservation of design in the case of the 5-inchcylinder, the only product cylinder qualified for 100% enriched material.Finally, they have shown a basic tendency toward brittle fracture inover-pressuring of the DOT-qualified type 30A cylinder, resulting ina recommendation for discontinuation of its use as a transport cylinder.</TEXT></DOC>
