SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Secretary of State James A. Baker III saidThursday that the evacuation of U.S. citizens from China has gonewell and President Bush praised the work of the U.S. ambassador forhelping Americans there.   ``Some have suggested that to show our forcefulness that I bringthe American ambassador (James Lilley) back. I disagree with that180 degrees,'' Bush said at his first prime-time news conference ofhis presidency.   The president insisted that his decision to leave the Lilley inBeijing was more productive than recalling him to Washington just toshow U.S. displeasure.   Calling Lilley ``our very able ambassador,'' Bush pointed outthat he had played a key role in helping win the release of CBSreporter Richard Roth, who had been caught up in the TiananmenSquare disturbances and held by Chinese authorities overnight.   ``We have seen in the last few days a very good reason to havehim there,'' Bush said.   Bush defended as appropriate the sanctions he announced onMonday, suspension of military aid, in response to the Chinesemilitary's masscre of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators inBeijing.   But the president said the United States cannot return to``totally normal relations'' with China unless that governmentrecognizes the validity of the pro-democracy movement.   Bush said economic sanctions would be ``counterproductive andwould hurt the people.''   The president added, however, that if the situation does notimprove he would take further steps ``at an appropriate time.''   Earlier, Baker said the U.S.-Chinese relationship has suffered``a tragic step backward,'' but stressed that economic ties shouldbe maintained to foster democratic reforms in China.   Baker, speaking at the National Press Club, reported that allAmericans who had gotten to Beijing's airport had been flown out ofthe country.   ``We're keeping our fingers crossed,'' Baker said of theevacuation of U.S. dependents of diplomatic personnel, which heordered a day earlier after diplomatic compounds in the capital werestrafed by gunfire.   The secretary had also appealed to private U.S. citizens to leavethe country as soon as possible.   Baker said that a power struggle appeared to be underway in thewake of the Sunday massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators and thatthe situation was still ``too clouded'' to tell exactly who is incharge.   He called the bloody massacre of the Chinese protesters ``tragicand deplorable.''   Baker also defended the decision to offer refuge to the Chinesedissident Fang Lizhi, who is in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing with hiswife and son.   China has accused the United States of interfering in itsdomestic affairs by harboring the astrophysicist, who had beenprevented from attending a dinner with President Bush during thepresident's visit to Beijing in February.   The secretary said he would not discuss whether Fang has soughtasylum, but noted that the dissident ``asked for refuge and wegranted that refuge.''   Baker made a point of saying that the United States has workedhard to improve ties with China since relations were formalized in1979.   ``We've spent many years in improving relations between the U.S.and China, in encouraging the movement towards democracy,'' Bakersaid, adding, ``We've had a very tragic step backward.''   It is vital, he said, that the United States ``recognize theimportance of this relationship.''   Asked whether Bush intended to take additional steps against theChinese beyond cutting military sales and freezing militaryexchanges, Baker said the president ``reserved the right to reviewall options.''   Baker noted that Bush ``has determined that it's important thatwe maintain the economic relationships that exist now,'' adding thatrecent turmoil appeared to be due to the fact that economic reformsin China were more advanced than political changes.   ``Those economic reforms are what led to the opening up that wesaw before this recent tragic and unfortunate and deplorablecrackdown,'' Baker said, adding, ``We think it's important that wemaintain, ... depending upon the future course of events there, ...these economic ties because those are the things that for the mostpart have led to a move toward openness.''   Baker defended U.S. Ambassador James Lilley and the U.S. Embassyin Beijing against criticism that not enough was being done to aidAmericans leaving the country.   Lilley and his team have been ``extraordinarly responsive'' tothe needs of Americans in China, Baker said, adding that not oneU.S. citizen had been killed in the violence and that only one hadbeen injured.   Baker pointed out that the U.S. government has charteredcommercial aircraft to fly to Beijing and Shanghai to supplementregular U.S. airline departures. Also, officials have organizedconvoys to help U.S. citizens get to the airports.   He cited United, Continental and Northwest airlines for being``quick to respond'' to the State Department's request for help.   On Wednesday Baker ordered the 258 dependents of U.S. governmentpersonnel in China to leave, and urged other Americans throughoutthe country to leave as well.   That step came after troops sprayed Beijing diplomatic compoundswith gunfire. Also, reports from China have indicated thatdisturbances had spread to more than a dozen provincial cities.   Some 8,800 Americans had notified U.S. officials in January thatthey were in China.   Later Thursday, State Department spokesman Adam Shub said theU.S. Embassy in Beijing had reported it knew of 115 Americans withofficial ties still in the city.   That includes 11 non-diplomats, one of them the ambassador'swife, plus other dependents, people who work in the embassy and twochildren whose parents are both members of the diplomatic staff,Shub said.   The State Department estimated that there are some 5,000 privateU.S. citizens left in China and 400 to 500 in Beijing, including anumber of American students who have refused to leave theiruniverity campuses in the capital city.</TEXT></DOC>
