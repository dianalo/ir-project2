 At several meetings during the past year, Romanian scientists haverepeatedly told me of an administration that capriciously controlled budgetsand appointments, determined national priorities, purged capable people forpolitical reasons, censored and confiscated mail and manuscripts, and deniedforeign travel, journal subscriptions, and equipment to scientists.andP;  To addinsult to injury, the Sandamp;T community was compelled to ritually thank her forher beneficence and leadership.andM;Nevertheless, Romania managed to develop an indigenous computing industry andacademic community since the 1960s.andP;  Computing was favored under theCeaucescus, presumably because of its progressive image and its pontentialboth to decrease the need for the import of products with broad applicabilityand to provide hard currency earning exports of value-added products.andM;The two largest production facilities are the Computer Manufacturing Company(ICE) and ROMCD.andP;  ICE makes micro- and minicomputers, the latter firststarted under a license with France's CII.andP;  ROMCD's main products are diskdrives and high-speed impact printers.andP;  It is the oldest surviving jointventure with an American company in Eastern Europe, having been formed in1974 with the Control Data Corporation.andP;  Both make licensed (ROMCD) orunlicensed (ICE) copies of U.S.andP;  products, and import their most advancedmicro-electronic components from the USSR, the West, and the Far East.andP;  Forexample, ICE builds IBM/PC-like microcomputers and a functional duplicate ofDigital's VAX 11/730 known as the Coral 8730.andP;  ROMCD's best-known product hasbeen a 58Mbyte voice coil disk drive that it licensed from CDC in 1977.andM;The activities of both companies were severely limited by Ceaucescu'sisolationist policies, weak indigenous Randamp;D capabilities, centralizedgovernment control of all major industry, a lack of domestic supportingindustries, undemanding internal markets, and COCOM export controls.andO;Consequently, these companies suffer from many of the problems that werecommon in the USSR and all the East European Communist countries--such asvery long production runs for products that are obsolete by world standards.andO;Most Romanian-made products were used domestically, although ROMCD had asteady, but modest, hard currency export market.andM;The leading educational institutions have been the Polytechnic Institute andthe Center for Perfecting of Cadres Development (the Romanian acronym isCEPECA).andP;  Both were opened in 1967.andP;  The principal computing program at thePolytechnic is a five-year undergraduate degree under the Faculty of Controland Computer Science.andP;  CEPECA was started as a United Nations academic centerfor teaching management and computing methods to mid-level managers andengineers from Romania and Third World countries.andP;  From 1974-89, CEPECAoperated under the Communist Party and the Academy of Social and PoliticalSciences as a training center for rising Party technocrats.andM;Although a member of the Warsaw Pact and a participant in some agreementsthat partially integrated the Soviet and East European computer industries,Romania's participation hardly extended beyond some rhetoric and formalisms.andO;Its computer-related imports and exports with its &quot;fraternal socialistbrothers&quot; were minuscule.andM;In spite of the existence of an indigenous industry, there were a lack ofvisible computer applications, (e.g., for railroad or airline ticketingsystems).andP;  It is very likely that the majority of Romanians had never seen anoperating computer under the old regime.andM;From Under the RubbleandM;Three examples will serve to illustrate the nature and extent of the messleft by the old regime--and of how difficult it will be to rebuild.andM;Bucharest.andP;  Much has been written about the huge palace that the Ceaucescusbuilt in the center of Bucharest.andP;  The Western press has used words like&quot;grotesque,&quot; &quot;monstrosity,&quot; and &quot;totalitarian ugliness&quot; to describe thedictators' gigantic monument to themselves.andP;  But on first sight this clean,white, marble building does not seem all that bad.andP;  One must spend time incentral Bucharest, walking or driving through block after block of similarbuildings, to appreciate the real horror of the Ceaucescus' master plan.andP;  Itcomes with the realization that much of the resources of this desperatelypoor country were sunk into these massive, incomplete, badly constructed,sterile, white marble buildings--and in the process, much of the historic oldcity was destroyed.andP;  Scores of construction cranes stand idle.andP;  For most ofthe year since the Ceaucescus' demise, the nearly destitute people of Romaniawere caught in the bind of having to choose between the two enormously costlyand bleak alternatives of either tearing it all down or completing it.andM;There is a computer in this national tragedy.andP;  It is being used by architectMariana Celac to try to build a graphics database to digitally reconstructthe destroyed old city, and of the deteriorating pieces that remain, in asmuch detail as possible.andP;  Many of these computerized images will have to bebuilt from people's memories.andP;  Gathering information for her two-year effort&quot;is complicated by the old regime's attempt to destroy the memory of the pastalong with its physical reality.andP;  People like Celac, who tried to takephotographs before and during the demolition, had their cameras and filmconfiscated and occasionally were beaten.andP;  when City Hall decided that a newmap would be needed for the area, it did not cut a new printing plate butetched over the old one&quot; [1].andM;And what does Ms.andP;  Celac hope to do with this database?andP;  Given the staggeringamount of white marble in place, and the recent decision of the presentneo-comunist government to complete the Ceaucescus' project, her options arepitifully limited.andP;  She hopes it can be used to help get passages and someopen land cut out from among the Ceaucescu buildings, and that these openingsand the remaining portions of the old city might be rebuilt using the plansin her database [1].andP;  But the economic condition of Romania--one of theslowest of the East European countries to embrace private enterprise orattract foreign investment--is such that most of the rebuilding is likely tobe in her computer for some time.andM;Towns and Villages.andP;  The towns and villages of the countryside are dividedinto two classes: those Ceaucescu &quot;rebuilt&quot; and those he had not gotten tobefore he was overthrown.andP;  The former are grim places whose populations wereevicted from their old homes and places in &quot;new&quot; badly constructedSoviet-style buildings with poor sanitation conditions, little in the way ofneighborhood facilities, and often in the shadow of filthy industrialoperations.andP;  The latter are not infrequently pristine-looking villages whereone of the few hints of the 20th Century can be seen in rubber automobiletires on the horse-drawn wagons.andM;Both the inhabitants of Ceaucescu's &quot;Brave New World&quot; and those he left inthe 19th Century share an almost total lack of exposure to the moderninformation technologies beyond the broadcast media (16.6 TVs per 100people).andP;  for all practical purposes, there are no phones in private ruralhouseholds.andP;  It is not uncommon for an entire small town or village to haveless than a half-dozen telephones.andM;But the first true national election, in May 1990, temporarily brought acomputer network to the Romanian countryside.andP;  Each of the roughly 40county-sized election districts and Bucharest supposedly had at least onemicrocomputer in the district election center, and they were connected to thenational center in Bucharest via telephone lines and a simple star-likedial-in topology.andP;  Election results for each district were gathered at thelocal center, tabulated, and forwarded to the national center.andP;  So far, Ihave no information on how well this worked in practice.andM;Education.andP;  Most of the CEPECA's computer-related instruction is provided byits Center for the Management of Information (CMI).andP;  Dan A. Farcas helpedcreate the CMI under the U.N.andP;  program.andP;  In 1982 he was purged by the regimeand forced out of CEPECA.andP;  Farcas was reinstated as director of CMI in thespring of 1990, a few months after the overthrow of the dictatorship.andP;  He wasreunited with an old friend--a fully operational IBM 360/40 that he helpedobtain 22 years ago as part of the U.N.andP;  program.andM;Farcas and CEPECA hope to modernize their equipment and texts so they canprovide contemporary educational offerings.andP;  But, as with all efforts torebuild on the rubble, there are basic problems.andP;  For example, what kinds ofcourses should CEPECA offer?andP;  Do they use upgraded equipment to teach the oldcourses based on the neo-Stalinist economy?andP;  Or do they simply teachWestern-style MIS courses that are based on economic structuresx that do notexist in Romania?andP;  Or do they teach rudimentary computing skills and waituntil the Romanian economy &quot;finds itself&quot; in some long-term way?andM;In Search of a ModelandM;How does a political or industrial leadership help such an economy &quot;finditself&quot;?andP;  To this end, there have been many internal discussions of whicheconomic and social model to adopt [2].andP;  Among those explicitly consideredand favored by a number of Romanian analysts and policy makers are:  Sweden,Austria, South Korea, Japan, the U.S., Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Poland,and Latin America.andM;In contrast to these discussions, which at times seem almost surreal (1),there are efforts by parts of the Romanian computing community to work outmore frugal models for themselves to survive in the post-Ceaucescu era.andP;  Forexample, ROMCD's general manager, Ovidiu Calugarescu, hopes his company canlicense production of machines (and their spare parts) that are obsolete inthe West, but which still have a small user base in the hard currencycountries and a prospective market in Romania.andP;  Given the past history of hiscompany, there is a basis for such aandM;strategy.andP;   Theodor Danila, the DeanandM;of the Faculty of Control and Computer Science at the Polytechnic, believesthat &quot;by nature Romanians are very industrious, and labor force skills hereare above average, and there is a better-than-average adaptability.&quot;andP;  Hethinks they can train students to do internationally competitive systemsdevelopment work.andP;  Everyone is looking for joint ventures with Western firms(e.g., to do contract software development or assemble products from importedcomponents).andM;But even the most practical strategies are severely handicapped by crushingrealities such as an extremely weak economic and commercial infrastructureand the lack of an adequate finance or distribution system.andP;  Almost everystrategy and hope depends on Western help of some sort.andP;  But that help is notlikely to be forthcoming, given the continuance of a neo-communist government(ironically elected by an overwhelming vote from the countryside), and aslong as Romania has little to offer that is not available as cheaply and inbetter quality elsewhere.andM;Western observers often recommend that Eastern Europe needs to acquire bettercomputer hardware and telecommunications equipment.andP;  Many in romania wouldagree.andP;  But there is also the larger and more basic need to develop aneconomy and society that can nurture these more specific needs.andP;  Thisperspective was recently voiced strongly by Wlad Turski of the University ofWarsaw:andM;The managerial techniques, certainly in Poland [which is in better shape thanRomania], are so backward that [a] big improvement would be to bring them tothe level of good managerial techniques of, say, the United States back inandlsqb;the] '30s, '40s, '50s.andP;  And you see they were not relying on computers atthat time, and that is probable because there were no computers.andP;  The use ofinformation technology, the use of information processing system, is a veryfine tool....andP;  But it's a subtle tool, and when you need a heavy job to bedone, the use of a fine and subtle tool is usually counter-productive: youbreak the tool, ...andP;  and you haven't done your job either.andP;  What's evenworse, you compromise the tool while attempting to use it.andP;  In my country,there is a situation of a bank which doesn't know how to cash a check andthere comes an expert from abroad that tells them to install computerizedteller stations.andP;  It wouldn't improve it an iota.andP;  They still don't know howto cash a check.andP;  They don't know what a discount is.andP;  They need to changetheir managerial and business practices to the point at which they becomedependent on a rapid supply of information....andP;  What use is a word processorto somebody who never answers a letter?andP;  The most advanced desktop publishingtechnology will not make people not accustomed to answering letters startanswering letters!andP;  You have first to make it necessary for the business tofunction to answer letters.andP;  Now, when answering letters becomes a necessity,andlsqb;a] matter of life or death for a business, then, yes, send them [a] wordprocessor, but not before [3].andM;AcknowledgmentsandM;Much of this column is based on information gathered during a visit toRomania in May 1990.andP;
