This need is based on current shipping problemsresulting from delays in intermodal transfers, insufficient channel dimensionsand other physical aspects affecting waterborne commerce. Identificationof water and related land resource problems in the study area has evolvedfrom prior studies, current investigations, and continuing public coordination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Questions regarding the DEIS shouldbe addressed to Mr. Jerry Pasquale, (215) 597-6840, U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers, CENAP-PL-E, U.S. Custom House, Second and Chestnut Streets,Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19106-2991.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">1. Proposed Action</ITAG>a. The proposed objective will be to improve the handling of bulk commodityproducts, which account for the majority of ship cargoes using this waterway.These commodities, which include crude oil, coal and iron ore, are currentlyshipped in partially loaded vessels, due to draft restrictions. Considerationis being given to both full width deepending and providing only a deeperinbound channel lane since the majority of benefits come from imports.Provision of a deeper channel would reduce or eliminate non-structuralpractices such as lightering and light loading, now in use by the restrictedvessels. In addition, several users are likely to employ larger vesselsif a deeper channel is provided.b. A critical element in the development of any navigation study is thedisposal of dredged material. Approximately 6 million cubic yards of materialfor the existing 40 feet deep channel project are annually dredged fromthe Delaware River betwen Philadelphia and the sea. Acquisition of disposalareas for the existing channel is now solely a federal responsibility.There are 8 active upland disposal areas for the Philadelphia to the seaproject. Additional dredged material disposal sites will be needed to adequatelyhandle dredged material from the existing federal project past the year2020.Project deepening would further reduce the capacity of existing sites andaccelerate the need for replacement sites. A secondary goal of this studyis to upgrade present disposal areas and locate additional sites with sufficientcapacity to handle deepending and maintenance dredging operations overthe project's full 50 year project life (2000-2050).c. Without the implementation of improvements for the Delaware River channel,the maximum draft of vessels using the waterway would be limited to thedraft now accommodated. Existing channel dimensions reduce the economicefficiency of larger ships moving through this major commercial area. Crudeand refined oil products are the highest volume commodity in United Statesfreight trade and account for the overwhelming majority of tonnage movedin the Delaware River. The refineries located along the Delaware Riveraccount for 10 percent of the refinery capacity of the United States andprovide petroleum products throughout the mid-Atlantic states. Approximately30 percent of all crude oil that comes to the Delaware River facilitiesis lightered. In addition, about 50 percent of the crude oil vessels, 60percent of the coal vessels and 80 percent of the iron ore vessels arepartially loaded.d. The study is being conducted in response to a resolution by the Committeeon Public Works of the United States Senate, dated March 1, 1954 and aresolution by the Committee on Public Works of the House of Representatives,dated December 2, 1970.<ITAG tagnum="84">2. Alternatives</ITAG>a. Alternative measures to improve navigation in the study portion of theDelaware River include no action and full-width or partial-width channeldeepening. Partial-width channel deepening would entail deepening the inboundlane, since the majority of vessels travel upstream loaded and downstreampartially or completely unloaded. The range of depths currently consideredfor deepening is 41 to 46 feet at mean low water. In addition, channelbend widening is being considered to facilitate larger vessels now usingthe waterway. Non-structural measures such as the use of tides to increaseavailable channel drafts and lightering are already employed and are beingincluded to the maximum extent practical in all channel modification schemes.b. Additional dredged material disposal capacity will be required for maintenanceof the existing project and any channel modifications for the 50 year projectlife. Alternative structural measures for increasing disposal capacityinclude raising dikes at existing sites, using sedimentation basins toreduce shoaling, acquisition of new upland sites, marsh/upland creationwithin the river and/or ocean/bay disposal. Non-structural alternativesinclude dewatering practices to facilitate greater consolidation of dredgedmaterial at existing sites, reusing dredged material and reducing dredgingactivities.<ITAG tagnum="84">3. Scoping</ITAG>a. Numerous study reports have been published since 1954 concerning allaspects of the proposed project. Evaluation of previously gathered datahas initiated both Federal interest and local support. In addition to thesereports, several reconnaissance studies were conducted to determine waterwayproblems and the Federal interest in further study.b. It is anticipated that a scoping meeting will be held to solicit additionalcomments from appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies. Participationof the general public and other interested parties and organizations willinitially be invited by means of newsletters. Based on the input of theseagencies and the interested public, a decision on additional scoping meetingswill be made.c. The significant issues and concerns that have been identified includethe potential impacts of the projects on aquatic and terrestrial biota,water quality, intertidal and shallow water habitats, wetlands, culturalresources, and economics.<ITAG tagnum="84">4. Availability</ITAG>It is estimated the DEIS will be released for public comment in April 1990.<ITAG tagnum="6">Robert L.
