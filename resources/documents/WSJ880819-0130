Chic Hecht. I was surprised that you omitted two very important points regarding his background.    First, he is the only senator on the Senate Banking Committee who has owned and successfully operated a bank. And, second, he is the only member of the Senate Intelligence Committee who operated behind the Iron Curtain when serving in U.S. Army Intelligence during the early 1950s. Because of his dedication and service, he is a member of the intelligence community's prestigious &quot;hall of fame.&quot;    Sen. Hecht is a man who is an unabashed pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-America member of the Senate. These are qualities sorely needed in Congress.    Sen. Steve Symms (R., Idaho)   Washington   ---   Your article correctly notes that Sen. Hecht is totally unpretentious, unlike some of his colleagues with their &quot;purposeful gait and stiff posture.&quot; Undoubtedly, if Chic Hecht ran for election among the tens of thousands of lobbyists and lawyers in Washington, he would lose.    This Washington establishment serves itself, not the people back home. It thrives on the wasteful hyperactivity of Congress -- thousands of unnecessary amendments, tens of thousands of pages of legislation, millions of words each year. But the people of Nevada and the other 49 states would be far better off if all members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, exercised the self-discipline shown by Sen. Hecht.    When Sen. Hecht agreed to serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee, he accepted that the supersecret issues there could not be used publicly and thus would not furnish material for his re-election campaign. As undersecretary of defense for policy (1981-1988) during Sen. Hecht's service on the Intelligence Committee, I was able to observe this work closely and came to appreciate how much our country owes this conscientious, knowledgeable senator.    The voters in Nevada will surely give more weight to Sen. Hecht's sterling character and performance on key committees than to his gait or homeownership in Washington. In fact, I suspect quite a few Nevadans might be delighted to have a senator represent them who just says &quot;no&quot; to the games people play to be popular with the Washington cocktail circuit and lobbyists.
