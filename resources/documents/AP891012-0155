An OTA study observed that in the earth and space sciencesalone, it is estimated that federal agencies are managing a dataarchive of roughly 100,000 gigabytes, the equivalent of about 45billion pages of text.   Developing an overall strategy for scientific and technicalinformation is needed, the congressional office said, if thepotential of new electronic technologies is to be fully realized.   It said technologies such as online electronic databases orhigh-density optical disks and magnetic cartridges offer ``greatpromise'' for timely, cost-effective storage and dissemination ofthe federal government's information.   ``Electronic technologies offer the only real hope for managingthe already massive federal archives of scientific data anddocuments,'' the OTA report said.   It noted that federal science agencies and interagencycoordinating groups have made some progress in a variety of areasrelated to handling scientific and technical information.   ``While these modest achievements were adequate for the earlierstages of the transition to a competitive, electronic environment,bolder initiatives are now necessary,'' the congressional agencysaid.   It recommended expanding the role of the White House Office ofScience and Technology Policy in dealing with scientific andtechnical information, as well as improving coordination betweenthat office and the presidential Office of Management and Budget.</TEXT></DOC>
