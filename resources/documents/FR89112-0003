The comment period for these proposed regulations closed on June 13,1988, and November 21, 1988, respectively. Additionally, on May 24, 1988,the FCA published certain aspects of the amendments proposed on May 12,1988, as interim regulations. 53 FR 18810. This action was taken to clarifythe legal requirements applicable to receiverships and conservatorshipsbecause two System institutions had recently been placed in receivershipby the FCA Board. The comment period on the interim regulations closedon June 23, 1988. In this document, the FCA Board responds to the commentsreceived on these proposed and interim regulations and adopts the interimregulations as final regulations without change.The amendments proposed on May 12, 1988, included revisions to conform12 CFR Part 611 to the requirements of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987(1987 Act) by providing for the protection of equities owned by Systemborrowers during a receivership; by permitting a System bank or associationin receivership to issue preferred stock to the Farm Credit System FinancialAssistance Corporation; by making technical changes to eliminate confusionregarding the implementation of joint and several liability on Systemwideand consolidated obligations; and by requiring that certain powers be exercisedby the FCA Board as opposed to the FCA or the Chairman of the FCA Board.The FCA received comments on these proposed amendments and the relatedinterim regulations from the Farm Credit Corporation of America (FCCA).The Farm Credit Bank of Baltimore (FCBB) also submitted a comment in whichit generally concurred with the FCCA's comments.Both the FCCA and the FCBB concurred with the change to andSection; 611.1174(c)published in the proposed and interim regulations which deleted provisionsrelating to the assignment of joint and several liability. While generallyconcurring with the other amendments proposed on May 12, 1988, the FCCAcommented that proposed andSection; 611.1156(a) ``* * * exceeds statutoryauthority in suggesting that an Assistance Board request to FCA `to initiateaction to appoint a receiver' must be conditioned upon an FCA determinationthat grounds for appointment exist.'' In response to this comment, theFCA Board has revised andSection; 611.1156(a) to clarify that the Farm CreditSystem Assistance Board (Assistance Board) could make such a request priorto an FCA determination that grounds exist for the appointment of a receiver.The FCCA also inquired whether the sale of loan assets by receivers ofSystem institutions would be subject to the borrower rights provisionsof the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended (Act), and the regulations promulgatedpursuant to these provisions. This question is discussed in the preambleto recently promulgated borrower rights regulations. 53 FR 35434 (September14, 1988).Additionally, the FCCA requested the FCA to publish for comment proposedregulations dealing with the authority of bank receivers to sell loan assetsto non-System lenders. The FCA has addressed this concern in further amendmentsto 12 CFR Part 611 published on October 31, 1988. These proposed amendmentsrelated to the sale and transfer of loans of a System institution in receivershipand the definition of insolvency stated in andSection; 611.1156(b)(1). Theproposed revisions to andSection; 611.1156(b)(1), contained in the implementingregulations for andSection; 4.12(b)(1) of the Act, would also permit theFCA to confirm that an institution is insolvent through means other thanexamination. The FCA received comments on these additional amendments fromthe FCCA. The FCBB, the Farm Credit Bank of Louisville and the LouisvilleBank for Cooperatives submitted comments in which they concurred with theFCCA's comments.The FCA did not receive any comments on the proposed amendment dealingwith the authority of bank receivers to sell loan assets to non-Systemlenders. While the FCCA concurred with the proposed amendment to andSection;611.1156(b)(1) permitting the FCA to confirm that insolvency exists throughmeans other than examination, the FCCA objected to the proposed revisionto andSection; 611.1156(b)(1) insofar as it defines insolvency as existingwhen a System institution is about to exhaust its permanent capital, andtreats eligible borrower stock as a liability instead of as equity. Inresponse to these concerns, the FCA Board now adopts only the amendmentto andSection; 611.1156(b)(1) permitting the FCA to confirm that insolvencyexists through means other than examination and does not yet respond tothe portion of the proposed rule relating to the definition of insolvency.<ITAG tagnum="85">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 611 </ITAG>Agriculture, Banks, Banking, Organization and functions (Government agencies),Rural areas.For the reasons stated in the preamble, Part 611 of Chapter VI, Title 12of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 611_ORGANIZATION</ITAG>1.
