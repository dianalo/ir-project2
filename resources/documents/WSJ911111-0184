Economists, however, concur that the vanishing westernGerman boom won't dissuade the Bundesbank from raising its9.25% Lombard rate a quarter of a point sometime before theend of the year. The economic slowdown hasn't damped fears ofa wage-price spiral ensuing from potentially inflationarywage demands by the nation's powerful labor unions next year,economists said.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The German unification boost is beginning to fade,&quot; saidNigel Rendell, international economist at James Capel andamp; Co.in London. The western German economy, which has been thelocomotive for much of Europe this year, accounts for morethan 90% of the total output of goods and services insideunified Germany.   On Friday, the Federal Statistics Office reported thefirst declines in western German retail sales since Germany'smonetary and economic unification last year.   In September, retail sales dropped a real, orinflation-adjusted, 0.6% from the year-earlier period. Theagency also revised its August retail sales figure to adecrease of 1.8% from a preliminary increase of 0.1%.   Manufacturing orders in the western half of the nationtumbled a price-adjusted and seasonally adjusted 2.6% inSeptember from August and fell 4.6% from a year earlier,Bonn's Economics Ministry reported Thursday. Manufacturingorders are considered a leading indicator of the wholeeconomy.   Industrial production in the western German states eased0.4% in September from the previous month and fell 0.3% froma year earlier, the economics ministry said Wednesday.   There was an unusual increase in the number of workers onshortened shifts in western Germany in October. According tofigures published Wednesday by the Federal Labor Office, thenumber of workers on reduced hours jumped by 40,500, or 31%,to 173,000, unusually high for this time of year. There wereonly 39,400 shortshift workers registered a year ago.   The jolting increase in workers on short hours was blamedon a slowdown in export orders received by western Germany'smachine tool, metalworking and electrical technology sectors,the Labor Office said.   The unification boom was unleashed on July 1, 1990, whenthe mark, one of the world's strongest currencies, wasintroduced overnight into what was then East Germany. Thatloosed pent-up consumer demand from East Germany's populationof 16 million.   Reconstruction of the eastern region of the country alsosparked a flood of orders for western Germany's industrialgroups. One sector after another, from construction toautomobiles to retailing, reported dizzying growth in profitsand sales.   The trend changed in recent weeks. Many of the samesectors now point to a reversal or at least a flattening ofthe growth, albeit at levels that are historically high. TheGerman Automobile Industry Association said recently that a10% drop in orders in the German car market this yearwouldn't be a surprise.   The slowdown stems from various roots. The first was aJuly 1 tax increase on income, energy and petroleum products.Economists also cite the latest Aug. 15 increase in interestrates by the Bundesbank that increased the already steep costof money.   Although there is no disagreement about the direction ofEurope's largest economy, projections for gross nationalproduct vary widely for 1991 and 1992. Last year, westernGermany had GNP growth of 4.5%.   The most bearish forecasts by private economists show ameager 1% growth in western German GNP in 1992 after 3.4%growth this year, as high interest rates hobble expansion.More optimistic projections call for growth around 2.7% nextyear after 3.4% this year.   The annual autumn report by Germany's five major economicinstitutes, known as the &quot;five wise men,&quot; forecast 2% growthfor western Germany next year.</TEXT></DOC>
