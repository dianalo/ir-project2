When President Bush dispatched Patriot anti-aircraftmissiles to Israel along with crews to operate them, healtered relations between the two countries, making Americanmilitary personnel directly responsible for Israeli securityfor the first time. And by sending the aircraft carrierForrestal from Florida to the coast of Israel, the presidentis underlining the notion that the security of both nationsare intertwined.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This represents an entirely new chapter inAmerican-Israeli relations,&quot; said David Harris, executivevice president of the American Jewish Committee. &quot;Israel hadnever sought until this weekend the presence of Americanmilitary to defend Israel's security. In the past, thedependence was on American materiel. And on this side, thereis a far greater understanding by the American public aboutIsrael's security predicaments in a highly dangerousneighborhood.&quot;   But the new warmth between the two countries, and theprospect of even more U.S. economic assistance, isn't likelyto blunt American efforts to press Israel to deal withPalestinians in the occupied territories.   &quot;It's a new era for the relationship, but when this isover the issue of Palestinians will still be there, and therewill still be pressure for Israel, in consultation with theU.S., to take steps to change the nature of this occupation,&quot;says Judith Kipper, a Middle East specialist at the BrookingsInstitution. &quot;This is not going to take that pressure away.The Palestinian problem is going to be that much moreinflamed after the war.&quot;   And though the U.S. and Israel clearly have closer tiesnow, the U.S. also has political debts to Egypt, Saudi Arabiaand other Middle Eastern nations, all of which will wantpressure increased on Israel to take steps on the Palestinianissue.   The great tension after the Iraq war may involve balancingthose debts. &quot;The Palestinian cause has been badly hurt sincethe beginning of this crisis, and their miscalculation hasbeen compounded now that Israel and the U.S. are closer,&quot;says Helena Cobban, a scholar-in-residence at the Foundationfor Middle East Peace. &quot;Israel's restraint, of course, is inits own national interest, though the Israelis alwaysmaximize their bargaining position. No doubt they will bringout that chit.&quot;   Palestinians already are maneuvering to keep the issue inthe limelight. &quot;There will be an attempt by Israel tocapitalize on this,&quot; says Hasan Rahman, director of thePalestine Affairs Center in Washington. &quot;But there is aninternational consensus on this, and they won't be able tokeep it off the agenda.&quot;   Right now, American military and political leaders arepraising Israel for its &quot;restraint&quot; in not retaliating fortwo series of Scud missile attacks from Iraq. Congress isexpected to go on record as early as tomorrow expressing itsrespect for Israel and its solidarity with the Israelidecision.   As U.S. warplanes continue their aerial barrage on Iraq,Israel has become one of the stationary fronts in the war, adevelopment that U.S. Jewish leaders believe not only hasgiven the American public and U.S. policy makers a glimpse ofthe precariousness of Israel's security but also has sweptaway months of distrust between the two countries.   &quot;The level of trust on both sides has gone upsubstantially,&quot; said Democratic Rep. Howard Berman ofCalifornia, a prominent voice in the Jewish community. &quot;Nowit's clear that Israel is willing to play ball -- andIsraelis believe that the U.S. is concerned about Israel'ssecurity.&quot;   These Jewish leaders believe that the last several dayswill provide Israel with substantial political capital thatcould pay dividends in the months and years to come.   &quot;There's a chance we could build up sufficient trustbetween these two countries that could last beyond when peacecomes,&quot; said Mark Talisman, director of the Washington officeof the Council of Jewish Federations. &quot;The U.S. has seen thevulnerability of Israel. The papers are filled, finally, withtributes to Israel's sacrifice and trust. It's sort of aninternational Montessori lesson.&quot;   Israel almost surely will seek to use that lesson to itsadvantage.   &quot;At some point on the world's agenda, there's going to bean attempt to negotiate a comprehensive peace in the MiddleEast,&quot; says Mark Siegel, a former Carter White Houseofficial. &quot;Right now the Israelis have got to be calculatingthat they will do best in that kind of a conference if theycooperate with the U.S.&quot;   Some experts believe their advantage may only be marginal,however. &quot;The way in which the Israelis have handled thethreats gives them a bit more control over the post-crisisshape of things, but those kinds of bargains don't lastforever,&quot; said William Quandt, a senior fellow at theBrookings Institution. &quot;The U.S. is going to want to dosomething on the Palestinian issue, though the U.S. approachmay be a bit more congenial to the Israelis as a result ofthis. There may be a search for a new way of looking atMiddle Eastern peace that doesn't have Israel and thePalestinians as much at the center of things.&quot;   Although the U.S. now provides about $3 billion a year ineconomic and military aid to Israel, relations between thetwo nations have been frayed in the last few years. PresidentBush, whose peripatetic telephone diplomacy and years ofcultivation have given him warm relationships with scores ofworld leaders, has never been at ease with Israeli PrimeMinister Yitzak Shamir, who in turn has seemed, to Americanpolicy makers, to be uncooperative on political and regionalmatters.   Now that the two men are on the same side -- indeed, onthe front lines -- of war with Iraq, the relationship, if notthe personal chemistry, has changed. The two spoke repeatedlyon the telephone over the weekend. Mr. Bush pointedly noted&quot;the anguish of your people and your government&quot; and vowed to&quot;use every resource possible to suppress and destroy themobile Scuds.&quot; Then he sent two Patriot batteries and crewsto join two units of the mobile, land-based surface-to-airguided missile systems that were delivered a month ago.   Some U.S. Jewish leaders believe that American officialsand commentators have overemphasized fears that theprominence of Israel in the anti-Iraq war will jeopardize thesurvival of the international coalition against SaddamHussein.   &quot;The members of the coalition are there for their owninterests,&quot; says Morrie Amitay, a pro-Israel activist andformer director of the American Israel Public AffairsCommittee. &quot;Where are the Egyptians going to go? They havenowhere else to go. The masses are more likely to rise up foreconomic reasons than because Israel might retaliate for amissile attack against them.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
