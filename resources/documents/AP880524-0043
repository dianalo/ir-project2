It was written by John Briscoe, now the bank's senior economistfor Brazil, and David de Ferranti, in charge of population mattersin its Southern Africa Department. The bank is the major source ofaid loans for almost 120 countries.   The study estimates that in the 1960s only about 20 percent ofpeople in poor countries had access to safe water. The authorsthink that now it is about 50 percent. According to the WorldHealth Organization, the best coverage is in Latin America and theCaribbean, followed by the Asia and Pacific region, with Africabringing up the rear.   ``Recent in-depth assessments in East and West Africa revealedthat the population actually using improved water supply schemeswas only one-third of the population reported to have access,'' thereport says.   Governments are apparently spending about $1.5 billion a year onrural water supply, including foreign aid from the United Statesand other countries, but the report says it would take three tofive times that much to get safe water to everyone by the year 2000.   Because fetching water has long been considered women's work inmany lands, men attach less importance to the time and effort ittakes, the report says.   In the lowlands of Lesotho, in southern Africa, it found that 30percent of families spend more than two and a half hours a daycollecting water.   ``Because drawing water is a woman's task, men have fewincentives to carry out repairs and many water systems no longerfunction,'' it says.   The U.S. Agency for International Development looked into thesituation in Kenya, Peru, Tanzania and Thailand and foundimportance attached to getting safe water for a variety of reasonsin addition to saving health and time: home gardens, livestock,brick making _ and beer-brewing.   According to the report, local people must have the mainresponsibility and bear much of the cost.   ``For some these ideas _ especially the implication thatdisadvantaged rural people should pay for improved water services _will seem a hardhearted, commercial approach,'' it said.   ``The evidence, however, is now in: the worst possible approachis seeing poor people as having no resources. ...Promises of freeservice for all too often result, in practice, in some service fora few and little or none for most.''</TEXT></DOC>
