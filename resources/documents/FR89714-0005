Background on the Pennsylvania Program</ITAG>The Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Pennsylvania programon July 31, 1982. Information on the background of the Pennsylvania programsubmission, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments,and a detailed explanation of the conditions of approval can be found inthe July 30, 1982, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (47 FR 33050). Subsequent actions concerningthe conditions of approval and program amendments are identified at 30CFR 938.11, 938.12, 938.15 and 938.16.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Submission of Amendment</ITAG>By letter dated December 5, 1988 (Administrative Record No. PA 720), DERsubmitted a proposed amendment to modify the following rules of the Pennsylvaniaprogram, at Title 25 Pennsylvania Code: Sections 86.1, 86.12, 88.1, 88.381,and 89.5. The proposed changes will expand regulatory coverage to includecoal preparation activities not previously regulated under the approvedprogram. The changes are briefly described below:(1) Amendments to 25 PA Code andSection;andSection; 86.1, 88.1, and 89.5 adda definition for ``coal preparation activity.''(2) Amendment to 25 PA Code andSection; 86.1 revises the definition of ``coalmining activity'' to include the term ``coal preparation activities.''(3) Amendment to 25 PA Code andSection; 86.12 adds provisions to allow forthe continued operation of newly regulated coal preparation activitiesbeyond the effective date of this amendment.(4) Amendment to 25 PA Code andSection; 86.1 grants valid existing rights(VER) to those coal preparation facilities and their associated haul roadswhich were lawfully in existence on or before July 6, 1984 and were notpreviously regulated under the Pennsylvania program.(5) Amendment to 25 PA Code andSection; 88.381 references coal preparationactivities in rules governing coal processsing facilities in the anthraciteregion.OSMRE published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 27, 1989, announcing receipt of theproposed program amendment and, in the same notice, opened the public commentperiod and provided opportunity for a public hearing on its substantiveadequacy (54 FR 4046). The public comment period ended February 27, 1989.No public comments were received. There was no request for a public hearingand the hearing scheduled for February 21, 1989, was not held.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Director's Findings</ITAG>Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR732.15 and 732.17 are the Director's findings concerning the proposed amendmentto the Pennsylvania program. Revisions which are not discussed below containlanguage similar to the corresponding Federal rules, or concern nonsubstantivewording changes and do not adversely affect other aspects of the program.(1) The term ``coal preparation activity'' is added and defined at andSection;andSection;86.1, 88.1 and 89.5 of the Pennsylvania Code. The new definition of coalpreparation activity includes all operations where coal is subjected tochemical or physical processing or cleaning, concentrating or other processingor preparation. Other activities conducted in support of coal preparationactivity are regulated as coal preparation activity. These activities include,but are not limited to, the following: Private roads appurtenant to coalpreparation activity; loading facilities; storage and stockpile facilities;shops and other buildings; water treatment and storage facilities; settlingbasins; and equipment and material storage areas. The definition of coalpreparation activity proposed by Pennsylvania is substantively the sameas the Federal definitions for ``coal preparation'' and ``coal preparationplant'' found at 30 CFR 701.5 and is deemed no less effective than theFederal regulations.(2) The term ``coal mining activity'' found at 25 PA Code andSection; 86.1is amended to include coal preparation activities. The substantive effectof adding the term coal preparation activities to the definition of coalmining activities is to cause coal preparation activities to be subjectto the permitting and performace standards of the approved State program.In essence, the same coal preparation activities and facilities regulatedunder the Federal rules are regulated by Pennsylvania's proposed definition.Therefore, the Director finds the revised definition of coal mining activityis no less effective than the Federal counterparts at 30 CFR 701.5.(3) The amendment will for the first time result in the regulation of facilitieswhich physically process coal. These newly regulated coal preparation facilitiesmust be authorized by a coal mining activity permit. Under proposed programrevisions at 25 PA Code andSection; 86.12, such facilities may continue tooperate if the operator submits a timely and complete permit applicationon which the DER has not yet rendered a decision and the operation is operatedin conformity with applicable performance standards. These criteria forcontinued operation are the same as those in 30 CFR 785.21(e). The Director,therefore finds the provisions at 25 PA Code andSection; 86.12 no less effectivethan the Federal regulations.(4) The term valid existing rights (VER) found at 25 PA Code andSection;86.1, which applies to all coal mining activity, is revised to set a limitingdate of July 6, 1984, for previously unregulated coal preparation activitiesand their associated haul roads. Subparagraph (iii) of the definition statesthat VER applies to coal preparation activities and their associated haulroads, which were not subject to the requirements of Chapters 86-90 priorto the effective date of this subsection, were in existence on or beforeJuly 6, 1984, and were operating in compliance with applicable laws priorto that date. July 6, 1984, is the date on which the District Court ruledthat facilities which in any way leach, chemically process, or physicallyprocess coal should be regulated as coal preparation plants even if theydo not separate coal from its impurities <T3>In Re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation (II)</T3>, CivilAction No. 79-1144 (D.D.C. 1984). The proposed amendment clarifies thatthe date of July 6, 1984, only pertains to coal preparation facilitiesand associated haul roads not previously covered under the approved programand that all other coal mining activities are subject to a limiting dateof August 3, 1977. Furthermore, the July 6, 1984, date set forth in theproposed amendment is identical to the date upon which Federal rules at30 CFR 827.13 subjected previously unregulated coal preparation plantsto the permanent program regulations of SMCRA and is consistent with thetiming of the District Court's decision. The Director, therefore findsthat the revised definition of VER is no less effective than the Federalregulations.(5) The general requirements for anthracite coal processing facilitiesfound at 25 PA Code andSection; 88.381 are revised to replace existing referencesto coal processing plants, facilities, and activities with the proposedterm ``coal preparation activity.'' The Director finds these proposed changesprovide clarity and consistency in the types of activities regulated andare no less effective than 30 CFR Part 820.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Disposition of Comments</ITAG>Pursuant to Section 503(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), commentswere solicited from various Federal agencies with an actual or potentialinterest in the Pennsylvania program. Comments were also solicited fromPennsylvania's Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC). No substantialcomments were received from the Federal agencies, but one comment was receivedfrom the PHMC.The PHMC objected to the date for establishing VER for coal preparationfacilities not previously regulated under the Pennsylvania program. Insteadof the July 6, 1984, date proposed in the amendment, PHMC felt that August3, 1977, the date when SMCRA was enacted, was more appropriate.Federal rules at 30 CFR 785.21 governing such facilities set July 6, 1984,as the date for establishing VER. This date coincides with the DistrictCourt for the District of Columbia's July 6, 1984, ruling in <T3>In Re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation (II)</T3>, No.79-1144 (D.D.C. 1984). In the discussion of 30 CFR 785.21 rulemaking (52FR 17728, May 11, 1987), the reasoning for selecting the date is discussedin detail. OSMRE stated that although it has jurisdiction to cover facilitiesoperating prior to July 6, 1984, it would be inequitable to do so. Priorto the District Court's decision, operators of such facilities could havereasonably believed that the program did not apply to them during theirperiod of operation and they could have made their business decisions uponreliance of those beliefs. The Commission's comment is not accepted becausethe date in the proposed Pennsylvania amendment for establishing VER forpreviously unregulated coal preparation facilities is the same as the dateestablished in the Federal rules.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Director's Decision</ITAG>For the reasons discussed in the finding above, the Director is approvingthe amendment as submitted to OSMRE on December 5, 1988.The Federal rules at 30 CFR Part 938 codifying decisions concerning thePennsylvania program are being amended to implement this decision. Thisfinal rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State programamendment process and to encourage States to conform their programs tothe Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federalstandards is required by SMCRA.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Procedural Determinations</ITAG>National Environmental Policy ActThe Secretary has determined that, pursuant to section 702(d) of SMCRA,30 U.S.C. 1292(d), no environmental impact statement need be prepared onthis rulemaking.Executive Order No. 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility ActOn July 12, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted OSMREan exemption from sections 3, 4, 7 and 8 of Executive Order 12291 for actionsdirectly related to approval or conditional approval of State regulatoryprograms. Therefore, for this action, OSMRE is exempt from the requirementto prepare a Regulatory Impact Analysis and this action does not requireregulatory review by OMB.The Department of Interior has determined that this rule will not havea significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq</T3>.). This rule will not impose any new requirements; rather,it will ensure that existing requirements established by SMCRA and theFederal rules will be met by the State.Paperwork Reduction ActThis rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 30 CFR Part 938</ITAG>Coal mining, Intergovernmental relations, Surface mining, Underground mining.<ITAG tagnum="6">Carl C.
