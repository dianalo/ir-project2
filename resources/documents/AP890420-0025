(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Radicals and Republicans, celebritiesand neighbors turned out to honor Abbie Hoffman as a wisecrackinggadfly who stayed true to his anti-Establishment convictions.   ``He didn't change his ideals when the ideological fashionchanged,'' said his cousin, newspaper columnist Sydney Schanberg.``He stood up against arbitrary power, capricious power andarrogant and callous power.   ``In other words, he stood up against bullies. I think that'swhy we cared about Abbie so much, because he had the courage forthe rest of us,'' said Schanberg, whose experiences as acorrespondent in Cambodia were the basis for the Oscar-winningmovie ``The Killing Fields.''   At least 900 people packed Temple Emanuel on Wednesday in memoryof the 1960s activist. Outside, an overflow crowd of more than 100stood listening to the service over a loudspeaker. Hoffman's bodywas cremated.   The turnout included ``Easy Rider'' producer Bert Schneider,former basketball star Bill Walton and folk singer Pete Seeger, wholed hundreds of mourners from Hoffman's childhood home to thesynagogue a few blocks away, singing ``Abbie's spirit is stillalive'' to the gospel song ``Down by the Riverside.''   Hoffman, 52, was found dead at his home near New Hope, Pa., onApril 12. A coroner ruled Tuesday that he committed suicide with anoverdose of barbiturates mixed with alcohol.   Friends and relatives said Hoffman had been suffering pain froma recent car accident, but they doubted he took his own life.   ``As a friend, it is my belief Abbie died of an overdose ofcaring and love,'' said Schneider, who with actor Jack Nicholsonhelped hide Hoffman while he was a fugitive from justice in the1970s to avoid trial on cocaine possession charges.   Hoffman gained fame as part of the Chicago Seven, a group ofradicals who were tried on charges of conspiring to disrupt thebloody 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Hoffman andfour others were acquitted of conspiracy but convicted of crossingstate lines with intent to riot. Their convictions were overturned.   Jerry Rubin, one of the Chicago Seven, said: ``I think Abbiefelt the pain of the world and exploded.''   Mourners ranged from gray-suited businessmen to long-hairedcolleagues from Hoffman's days as founder of the Yippie movement,or Youth International Party, a loosely knit group of radicals toprotest the government and the Vietnam War.   Among them were Aron Kay, who made a name for himself bythrowing pies in faces of public officials.   ``Abbie was a man who had guts and chutzpah. He was a truepatriot,'' said Kay, who wore a tie-dyed T-shirt and hat knit ofrainbow-colored wool with a Yippie pin stuck in it.   ``Abbie was my hero,'' said Jay Severan, a Republican politicalconsultant from New York City. ``He was the first and best mediaconsultant I ever knew.''   Schanberg read excerpts from Hoffman's closing arguments in his1987 trial in Northampton on trespassing charges stemming from hisarrest at an anti-CIA demonstration with Amy Carter, daughter offormer President Carter. Hoffman and the other defendants wereacquitted of the charges.   ``I grew up with the idea that democracy is not something youbelieve in or a place you hang your hat, but it's something youdo,'' Hoffman told the jury. ``You participate. If you stop doingit, democracy crumbles and falls apart.''</TEXT></DOC>
