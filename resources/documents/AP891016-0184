The only hope for averting the cuts _ imposed automatically bythe Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law _ was for the House and Senateto agree to a compromise budget-cutting bill and send it to Bushfor his signature by midnight.   Such quick work was made virtually impossible by the situationon Capitol Hill. The House version of the measure was studded withdozens of controversial provisions _ ranging from Bush's cherishedcapital gains tax cut to an expansion of child care services _ andmany lawmakers were out of town.   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush wouldsign an order that would appear in Tuesday's Federal Registerspecifying the across-the-board cuts in most federal programs,outside of Social Security and other entitlements.</TEXT><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The first 46 of the more than 1,300 EastGermans trying to reach the West through Poland renounced theircitizenship Monday and in return got exit permits from the EastBerlin government.   ``We are free,'' read a hand-lettered banner unfurled as thecheering refugees emerged from the East German Embassy clutchingnew identity cards.   They were taken in two buses to the West German Embassy for thecitizenship papers the West Germans automatically provide to EastGermans. The refugees said they expected to leave Warsaw on Tuesday.

The changes apparently would give the United States the right tocontinue producing chemical weapons after the treaty was signed,and would allow the United States to maintain a portion of itsstockpile until all nations capable of making chemical weapons signthe proposed treaty.   The shift ``is going to cause a little commotion in thenegotiations,'' said an administration arms control expert whospoke on condition of anonymity. ``It will cause us difficulties inGeneva,'' where the multilateral negotiations are under way.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said Monday that ``unlessthe president clarifies his position on this issue _ makes adecision and makes it known _ it is likely that little progresswill be made in Geneva toward achieving the multilateral treatyprohibiting chemical weapons which the president, ironically, hasstated is one of his highest priorities.''</TEXT></DOC>
