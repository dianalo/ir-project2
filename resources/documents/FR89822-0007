Wherethe invention involves a biological material and words alone cannot sufficientlydescribe how to make and use the invention in a reproducible or repeatablemanner, access to the biological material is necessary for the satisfactionof the statutory requirements for patentability under 35 U.S.C. 112. Therules set forth examining procedures and conditions of deposit which mustbe satisfied in the event a deposit is required to provide the necessaryaccess. The rules do not address the substantive issue of whether a depositis required under any particular set of facts. These rules will be effective for all applications filed on or after January1, 1990, and for all reexamination proceedings in which the request forreexamination was filed on or after January 1, 1990, except that depositsmade prior to the effective date which are acceptable under current practicewill be acceptable in such applications and proceedings. Since most ofthe provisions reflect existing policy and practice, little change to existingpractice or burden on applicants for patent and patent owners relying onthe deposit of biological material is anticipated. Applicants and patentowners are encouraged to comply with these rules prior to the effectivedate.The final rules on the deposit of biological materials for patent purposeshave evolved over several years of actual experience in administering theguidelines set forth in section 608.01(p) of the Manual of Patent ExaminingProcedure, including several administrative and judicial decisions, andinteraction with interested public, bar and industry groups. A draft policystatement on the deposit of biological materials was circulated among interestedbar and industry groups and published in the BNA-Patent, Trademark andCopyright Journal on May 22, 1986. An advance notice of proposed rulemakingsetting forth rules being considered for deposit of biological materialwas published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, 52 FR 34080 (September 9, 1987), and in the<T3>Official Gazette,</T3> 1082 O.G. 47 (September 29, 1987). Finally,a notice of proposed rulemaking relating to the deposit of biological materialsfor patent purposes was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, 53 FR 39420 (October 6, 1988), and in the <T3>Official Gazette</T3>, 1095 O.G. 47 (October 25, 1988).In this notice of final rulemaking, a description of the changes in thetext of the proposed rules is provided along with an explanation of thereasons supporting the changes. In addition, comments received in responseto the notice of proposed rulemaking are analyzed. Finally, an explanationof the content of the final rules is provided, together with a compilationof relevant comments and responses that have been made during the rulemakingprocess. This explanation and compilation of previous comments and responseswill serve as a set of guidelines that will be reproduced in the Manualof Patent Examining Procedure in due course.<ITAG tagnum="84">Changes in Text of Proposed Rules </ITAG>Several changes have been made in the text of the final rules from thetext of the proposed rules which were published for comment in the noticeof proposed rulemaking. Those changes are discussed below.Section 1.200 as proposed has been renumbered as andSection;1.801 as adoptedand the term ``patent purposes'' as proposed has been replaced with theterm ``purposes of patents for inventions under 35 U.S.C. 101'' as adoptedto clarify that the regulations pertaining to the deposit of biologicalmaterial do not apply for purposes other than patents for inventions. Thus,these regulations are not applicable to applications for plant patentsunder 35 U.S.C. 161-164.Section 1.201 as proposed has been renumbered as andSection;1.802 as adoptedand the term ``or Opportunity'' in the heading thereof has been insertedafter ``Need'' to reflect the permissive nature of a deposit when not necessaryto satisfy 35 U.S.C. 112.Paragraph (a) thereof as proposed provided that where a claimed inventionis or relies on a biological material, the disclosure may include a depositof the biological material deposited in a depository and under conditionscomplying with these regulations, provided a precondition was satisfied.The precondition was that the biological material not be known and readilyavailable to the public and not be describable in writing alone. Paragraph(a) as adopted eliminates this precondition, does not require that thebiological material be, or be used for, a claimed invention, does not requirethat the deposit be made in a depository and under conditions complyingwith these regulations, and more accurately states that the disclosuremay include reference to a deposit, since the deposit is not physicallypart of the disclosure. Paragraph (a) as adopted merely provides that wherean invention is, or relies on, a biological material, the disclosure mayinclude reference to a deposit of such biological material.Paragraph (b) of andSection;1.802 prescribes that biological material neednot be deposited unless access to the material is necessary to satisfy35 U.S.C. 112. If a deposit is necessary, it shall be acceptable if madein accordance with these regulations. Proposed paragraph (b) made no referenceto 35 U.S.C. 112. Situations where a biological material is known and readilyavailable to the public or can be made or isolated without undue experimentationare now listed as some, but not an exhaustive set, of the circumstanceswhere deposit need not be made. The term ``from known and readily availablematerial'' has been dropped from the end of the term ``can be made or isolatedwithout undue experimentation'' as redundant. Paragraph (b) as adoptedalso prescribes that once deposited in a depository complying with theseregulations, a biological material will be considered to be readily availableeven though some requirement of law or regulation permits access only underconditions imposed for safety, public health or similar reasons. Proposedparagraph (b) did not include the condition of deposit in a depositorycomplying with these regulations.Proposed paragraph (c) thereof was limited to reference to a specific organismor other biological material in a specification disclosure as not creatinga presumption that the material was necessary to satisfy 35 U.S.C. 112or that a deposit thereof is required. Paragraph (c) as adopted eliminatesthe term ``specific organism or other'' as redundant and also includesthe act of deposit by an applicant or patent owner as not creating a presumptionthat the deposit is or was required.Section 1.202 as proposed has been renumbered as andSection;1.803 as adopted.Paragraph (a) thereof as proposed prescribed that a deposit shall be madein any International Depositary Authority (IDA) or any other depositoryrecognized as suitable by the Office. Paragraph (a) as adopted now specifiesthat such deposits shall be recognized for the purpose of these regulationsso as not to preclude deposits made for other reasons such as a gratuitousdisclosure. Paragraph (a)(2) as adopted eliminates the requirement in theproposed rule that impartial consultants be from the biotechnology industryor governmental agencies. Paragraph (a)(2) as adopted also contains newsub-subparagraph (vii) as a requirement which a suitable depository mustmeet, <T3>viz</T3>., that it promptly notify depositors of its inability to furnishsamples, and the reasons why. This requirement appeared, in essence, inproposed andSection;1.204(a).Proposed paragraph (b) thereof has not been adopted. Replacement of depositsis governed solely by andSection;1.805, <T3>infra.</T3>Proposed paragraph (c) thereof has been adopted as paragraph (b). In subparagraph(2) thereof, ``(b)'' has been changed to ``(a)(2)'' to correct an inadvertenterror in the proposed rule.Proposed paragraph (d) thereof has been adopted as paragraph (c) exceptthat the reference to paragraph (a) has been changed to paragraph (a)(2)to more clearly delineate which category of depository is intended to becovered by this paragraph of andSection;1.803 and all references to otherparagraphs whose designations have been changed by adoption of these ruleshave been changed accordingly.Proposed paragraph (e) thereof has been adopted as paragraph (d).Section 1.203 as proposed has been renumbered as andSection;1.804 as adopted.Paragraph (a) thereof prescribed that an original deposit of a biologicalmaterial may be made before filing an application for patent or, pursuantto a requirement that will be made by the examiner no later than the datethe Notice of Allowance and Issue Fee Due is mailed, during pendency ofthe application for patent. Paragraph (a) as adopted adds a preconditionto making an original deposit that the biological material be specificallyidentified in the application as filed. Since proposed paragraph (a) didnot address original deposits made during the pendency of an applicationthat were not made pursuant to a requirement of an examiner, the rule asadopted states that original deposits may be made during pendency of anapplication for patent, subject to andSection;1.809, <T3>infra</T3>, which prescribes, <T3>inter alia</T3>, when during the pendency of an application for patenta deposit shall be made when made pursuant to a requirement by the examiner.Paragraph (b) thereof as proposed required a statement that, for an originaldeposit made after the effective filing date of an application for patent,the biological material deposited was the same biological material describedin the application as filed. Paragraph (b) as adopted substitutes the word``a'' for the word ``the'' since more than one biological material maybe referred to in the application as filed, drops the word ``same'' andrequires the statement that the biological material deposited is a biologicalmaterial specifically identified in the application as filed.Section 1.204 as proposed has been renumbered as andSection;1.805 as adoptedand a reference to supplemental deposits has been added to the headingthereof. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of the section as proposed have been substantiallyrewritten as paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). New elements have been addedand some eliminated, although some elements of the proposed rule on replacementdeposits have been adopted, either with similar language or different language.Elements of the proposed rule on replacement deposits which have not beenadopted include a requirement that replacement deposits be made or be madewithin a specific time limit. Ramifications in Office proceedings fromnot making a replacement deposit, or in the case of a patent, not diligentlymaking a replacement deposit, are stated.A requirement in the proposed section that depositories promptly notifydepositors of an inability to furnish samples has been adopted as andSection;1.803(a)(2)(vii),<T3>supra.</T3>Paragraph (a) of andSection;1.805 requires a depositor, after receiving noticeduring the pendency of an application for patent, application for reissuepatent or reexamination proceeding, that the depository possessing a depositeither cannot furnish samples thereof or can furnish samples thereof butthe deposit has become contaminated or has lost its capability to functionas described in the specification, to notify the Office in writing, ineach application for patent or patent affected. In such a case, or wherethe Office otherwise learns, during the pendency of an application forpatent, application for reissue patent or reexamination proceeding, thatthe depository possessing a deposit either cannot furnish samples thereofor can furnish samples thereof but the deposit has become contaminatedor has lost its capability to function as described in the specification,the need for making a replacement or supplemental deposit will be governedby the same considerations governing the need for making an original depositunder the provisions set forth in andSection;1.802(b). A replacement or supplementaldeposit made during the pendency of an application for patent shall notbe accepted unless it meets the requirements for making an original depositunder these regulations, including the requirement set forth under andSection;1.804(b).A replacement or supplemental deposit made in connection with a patent,whether or not made during the pendency of an application for reissue patentor a reexamination proceeding or both, shall not be recognized by the Officeunless a certificate of correction under andSection;1.323 is requested bythe patent owner which meets the terms of paragraphs (b) and (c) of thissection. The proposed rules did not provide for certificates of correctionrelating to replacement or supplemental deposits.Paragraph (b) of andSection;1.805 prescribes that a request for certificateof correction under this section shall not be granted unless the certificateidentifies the accession number for the replacement or supplemental deposit;the date of the deposit; and the name and address of the depository.Paragraph (c) of andSection;1.805 prescribes that a certificate of correctionunder this section shall not be granted unless the request therefor ismade promptly after the replacement or supplemental deposit has been madeand includes a verified statement of the reason for making the replacementor supplemental deposit; a verified statement from a person in a positionto corroborate the fact, and shall state, that the replacement or supplementaldeposit is of a biological material which is identical to that originallydeposited; a verified showing that the patent owner acted diligently_inthe case of a replacement deposit, in making the deposit after receivingnotice that samples could no longer be furnished from an earlier deposit,or in the case of a supplemental deposit, in making the deposit after receivingnotice that the earlier deposit had become contaminated or had lost itscapability to function as described in the specification; a verified statementthat the term of the replacement or supplemental deposit expires no earlierthan the term of the deposit being replaced or supplemented; and otherwiseestablishes compliance with these regulations, except that if the personmaking one or more of the required statements or showing is an attorneyor agent registered to practice before the Office, that statement or showingneed not be verified.Paragraph (d) of andSection;1.805 prescribes that a depositor's failure toreplace a deposit, or in the case of a patent, to diligently replace adeposit and promptly thereafter request a certificate of correction whichmeets the terms of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, after beingnotified that the depository possessing the deposit cannot furnish samplesthereof, shall cause the application or patent involved to be treated inany Office proceeding as if no deposit were made.Paragraph (e) as adopted is identical to proposed paragraph (d) exceptthat the word ``the'' before ``patent'' has been replaced with ``a'' becausethe term ``the patent'' had no antecedent basis, and the term ``accordingto these regulations'' has been inserted after the word ``replaced'' tomake it clear that the rebuttable presumption according to this paragraphapplies only where the replacement deposit has been made according to theseregulations.Paragraph (f) as adopted is substantially similar to proposed paragraph(e) with respect to an applicant's ability to make a replacement for anyreason during the pendency of an application for patent. Paragraph (f)extends such applicant's ability to supplemental deposits as well. Thefirst two sentences of proposed paragraph (e) prescribing when a replacementdeposit shall be made while an application is still pending and that anapplicant notify the Office when a replacement deposit is necessary havebeen adopted in andSection;1.805(a), <T3>supra.</T3>Paragraph (g) as adopted is identical to proposed paragraph (f) exceptthat supplemental deposits are also included and the reference to anothersection therein has been changed to reflect its renumbering.Paragraph (h) as adopted is substantially similar to proposed paragraph(g) except for two changes. One is that the word ``the'' before ``biologicalmaterial'' has been changed to ``a'' because the term ``the biologicalmaterial'' had no antecedent basis. The other change is replacement ofthe term ``viable deposit is in the depository'' with the term ``depositorycan furnish samples thereof''. The term ``in the depository'' was not clear.The word ``viable'' before ``deposit'' would have excluded biological materialsnot capable of reproduction either directly or indirectly. For biologicalmaterials which are so capable of reproduction, samples of viable depositsthereof which become non-viable cannot be furnished by the depository.Paragraph (i) as adopted modifies paragraph (h) as proposed. Whereas theproposed rule proscribed a patentee from replacing a viable deposit wherethe depository can furnish samples, the rule as adopted states that theOffice will not recognize in any Office proceeding a replacement depositof a biological material made by a patent owner where the depository couldfurnish samples of the deposit being replaced.Section 1.205 as proposed has been renumbered as andSection; 1.806 as adopted.The proposed rule had set the term of deposit as, <T3>inter alia, </T3>at least thirty years after the date of a viable deposit.The rule as adopted sets the thirty-year term to begin after a deposit,before or during pendency of an application for patent, is made. The termof a deposit made by a patent owner is not prescribed. However, andSection;1.805(a), <T3>supra, </T3>prescribes that a replacement or supplemental deposit madein connection with a patent will not be recognized in any Office proceedingunless a certificate of correction under andSection; 1.323 is requested bythe patent owner which meets the terms of paragraphs (b) and (c) of andSection;1.805, one of which terms is a verified statement by the patent owner thatthe term of the new deposit expires no earlier than the term of the depositbeing replaced or supplemented. An additional change in the rule as adoptedis the replacement of the term ``deposited biological material'' with theword ``deposit'' since the former term had no antecedent basis.Section 1.206 as proposed has been renumbered as andSection; 1.807 as adopted.The rule as adopted is identical to the rule as proposed except for thereference to a rule which has been renumbered.Section 1.207 as proposed has been renumbered as andSection; 1.808 as adopted.In paragraph (a) thereof, first word, ``The'' as proposed has been replacedwith ``A'' because ``The'' had no antecedent basis.In view of the non-adoption of proposed andSection; 1.207(c), <T3>infra, </T3>paragraph (a)(2) as adopted refers to only paragraph (b),not paragraphs (b) and (c).Paragraph (b)(1) as proposed permitted a depositor to require, <T3>inter alia, </T3>that a depository furnish samples only if a requestfor a sample is in writing and signed. Paragraph (b) as adopted permitsa depositor to require a request to be in writing or other tangible form.The signing requirement, however, has not been adopted.Paragraph (b)(3) as proposed permitted a depositor to require, <T3>inter alia, </T3>that a depository furnish the depositor with a copyof the request. This requirement has not been adopted.Paragraph (c) as proposed has not been adopted.Paragraph (d) as proposed, with one change, has been adopted as paragraph(c). The change is the insertion of the term ``made to the Office'' afterthe term ``Upon request'' to make it clear that certification imposes noburden on a depository.Section 1.208 as proposed has been renumbered as andSection; 1.809 as adopted.The term ``required'' when referring to ``deposit'' in proposed paragraphs(a), (b) and (c) thereof has been changed to ``needed'' as adopted forpurposes of consistency with andSection; 1.802. The term ``in case one hasnot been made, or'' as proposed in paragraph (a) has been replaced with``and if needed,'' as adopted for purposes of clarification. The statementas proposed that a deposit accepted in any acceptable depository underandSection; 1.202(a) shall be accepted for patent purposes if made underconditions complying with andSection; 1.207(a) has not been adopted. Thestatement is redundant in view of the provision in andSection; 1.802(b) asadopted that a deposit necessary for the satisfaction of 35 U.S.C. 112shall be acceptable if made in accordance with these regulations. Sincethe question of deposits may come up in reissue applications and reexaminationproceedings as well as in applications for patents, paragraph (a) as adoptedcovers examination of all such applications and proceedings. Paragraph(a) as adopted also refers to supplemental deposits since issues of theneed for a supplemental deposit may arise where a deposit has lost itscapability to function as described in the specification. Paragraph (a)as proposed prescribed that affected claims would be rejected in an Officeaction. Paragraph (a) as adopted drops ``in an Office action'' and insteadprescribes that the claims would be rejected ``where appropriate.''Paragraph (b)(1) as proposed was limited to applicants. Paragraph (b)(1)as adopted covers applicants for patents and patent owners involved inspecified Office proceedings. The provision for applicants for patentsin paragraph (b)(1) as adopted is identical to the provision for applicantsin paragraph (b)(1) as proposed except for the additional adoption of areference to supplemental deposits. Paragraph (b)(1) as adopted additionallyprovides for patent owners responding to a rejection under paragraph (a)of this section by requesting a certificate of correction of the patentwhich meets the terms of paragraphs (b) and (c) of andSection; 1.805.Paragraph (b)(2) as proposed has not been adopted. Subparagraph (3) hastherefore been renumbered as (2) and the reference therein to paragraph(b)(2) has been eliminated. Two additions have been made. One, since thequestion of deposit may come up in connection with a reissue applicationor reexamination proceeding, the term ``or patent'' has been inserted after``application'' in the first sentence. Two, since paragraph (a) providesfor a rejection under 35 U.S.C. 112 when a deposit actually made cannotbe accepted, it is considered an appropriate response that a deposit actuallymade should be accepted. Thus, the term ``and/or why a deposit actuallymade should be accepted'' has been inserted at the end of the first sentenceof paragraph (b)(2) as adopted.Paragraph (c) as proposed has been adopted except that the term ``for patent''has been inserted after ``application'' in the first sentence to make itclear that this paragraph does not apply to other applications, such asapplications for reissues. Additionally, the word ``the'' before the proposedterm ``required deposit'' has been changed to ``a'' because the term ``therequired deposit'' had no antecedent basis. Finally, the term ``37 CFR''preceding ``1.136'' in the proposed rule has been replaced with ``andSection;''as adopted to be consistent with standard nomenclature.Paragraph (d)(3) as proposed required a taxonomic description of the deposit.Paragraph (d)(3) as adopted requires a description of the deposited biologicalmaterial sufficient to specifically identify it and to permit examination.Paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) have otherwise been adoptedexcept for the addition of prefatory articles ``The'' or ``A''.<ITAG tagnum="84">Response to and Analysis of Comments </ITAG>Written comments from sixteen (16) sources were received in response tothe notice of proposed rulemaking. Some suggestions made in comments havebeen adopted as presented or in modified form and others have not beenadopted. A detailed analysis of the comments follows. <T3>Comment: </T3>The proposed rule numbers, except andSection; 1.200, arethe same as those of the old interference rules, and it appears to be Officepractice to normally avoid using rule numbers which end in ``00,'' especiallyfor a rule, viz., andSection; 1.200, which is the first of a group of rules.The rules, if adopted, should have different numbers. <T3>Response: </T3>The suggestion has been adopted. Proposed andSection;andSection;1.200 through 1.208 have renumbered as andSection;andSection; 1.801 through1.809 as adopted, respectively. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two comments ask whether the rules will apply retroactively.One comment suggests that they should and further, that the benefits providedfor depositors in proposed andSection; 1.207 (b) and (c) take effect immediatelyso that those patent applicants who would benefit from them will be encouragednot to delay in filing or obtaining a patent until a final rule takes effect.<T3>Response: </T3>To the extent the rules codify existing office practice,they are already effective. Otherwise, the rules will be effective in applicationsfor patent or for reissue of patent filed on or after January 1, 1990,and in reexamination proceedings in which the request for reexaminationwas filed on or after January 1, 1990, except that deposits made priorto the effective date which are acceptable under current practice willbe acceptable in such application and proceedings. Applicants and patentowners are encouraged to comply now with those requirements of the rulesnot required by existing Office practice. <T3>Comment: </T3>A sentence should be added at the end of proposed andSection;1.200 to clarify that the rule does not preclude the possibility of depositingother biological materials for patent purposes, such as plants <T3>per se, </T3>even though not within the scope of the term ``biologicalmaterial'' as defined by the rule. Adding such a sentence would be consistentwith previous concerns expressed to the Office over the possible requirementfor deposits with respect to plant patents. With the added sentence, therule would not address any kind of requirement for deposit in plant patents.<T3>Response: </T3>In a response to a comment in the notice of proposedrulemaking, it was stated that the Office did not intend to propose ruleson deposits under the Plant Patent Act (35 U.S.C. 161-164) at this time,nor will the Office take the position that a deposit is required underthe present provisions of 35 U.S.C. 162. The text of the rule adopted inandSection; 1.801 is the same as proposed in andSection; 1.200 except thatthe rule now explicity states that the regulations are for purposes ofpatents for inventions under 35 U.S.C. 101. Thus, these regulations donot and are not intended to address the question of deposits in plant patentapplications. <T3>Comment: </T3>One comment suggests that the language in andSection; 1.200should be expanded to make it clear that other biological materials, suchas plants <T3>per se, </T3>are not precluded from being deposited. Another commentassumes that the Office intends to limit the scope of ``biological material''as defined by this rule. The rules and commentary should indicate thatthe scope and effect of the rules are limited to biological materials asdefined in the rules. This rule is acceptable provided it simply defineswhat constitutes biological material. <T3>Response: </T3>None of the suggestions have been adopted. In a responseto a comment in the notice of proposed rulemaking, it was stated that biologicalmaterial is defined in the proposed rule in terms of a non-exhaustive listof what it includes and that no materials were explicitly excluded. Theresponse also stated that the Office does not contemplate that there wouldbe many situations where a material that is not capable of self-replicationeither directly or indirectly would be acceptable as a deposit under theseregulations but that an applicant was not precluded in any given case fromattempting to show why such a material should be acceptable. Plants <T3>per se </T3>are an example of such materials. <T3>Comment: </T3>The proposed rules do not, but should, address a problemassociated with marine sponges and other marine macroorganisms. These materialsand their natural location can be adequately described so that one skilledin the art could obtain them using the necessary equipment. But their taxonomyis in a developmental stage and scientific names are subject to revision.Deposit and maintenance of these materials in viable form is not practical.They can and have been deposited in non-viable form, preserved or fixatedin a suitable non-destructive medium, where their shelf life is expectedto be at least 30 years. <T3>Response: </T3>See the response to the previous comment. As statedin a response to a comment in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking,the PTO Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences held that a descriptionof the precise geographic location of marine tunicates used in a claimedinvention was adequate to satisfy the enablement requirement of 35 U.S.C.112. <T3>Ex Parte Rinehart, </T3>10 USPQ2d 1719 (PTO Bd. Pat. App. andamp; Int.1985). It was also stated in that response that the term ``readily'' asused in the term ``known and readily available'' appearing in the proposedrules is considered appropriate to define that degree of availability whichwould be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the comment states thatthe subject materials and their natural location can be adequately describedso that one skilled in the art could obtain them using the necessary equipment,the disclosure would appear to be sufficient to meet the enablement requirementsof 35 U.S.C. 112 without a deposit so long as their degree of availabilityis reasonable under the circumstances. <T3>Comment: </T3>In a response to a comment in the notice of proposedrulemaking which was in response to a solicitation for comments in theadvance notice of proposed rulemaking on the setting of an appropriateminimum number of seeds to ensure availability of the seed through theenforceable life of the patent, it was stated that the Office does notintend to propose rules quantifying a minimum number of seeds but thatthe Office will consider 2500 to be a minimum number in the normal caseand will provide an applicant an opportunity to provide justification whya lesser number would be suitable under the circumstances of a particularcase. One comment suggests that 2500 may present problems where the normalyield of a plant is only a few seeds. A more reasonable minimum is 1250.Another comment suggests that there be no minimum number but an obligationon the part of the depositor to replace a seed each time one is requested.<T3>Response: </T3>Since the Office has stated that an applicant will beprovided an opportunity to show why a lesser amount than 2500 seeds wouldbe appropriate in a particular case, the policy of requiring a minimumnumber of 2500 is adhered to. An obligation on the part of the depositorto replace a seed each time one is requested is simply impractical.<T3>Comment: </T3>The title of proposed andSection; 1.201 should be changedfrom ``Need to make a deposit'' to ``Opportunity to make a deposit'' sincethe provision states that ``the disclosure <T3>may</T3> include a deposit of a biological material * * *.''<T3>Response: </T3>The suggestion has been adopted in part. Since andSection;1.802 applies to situations both when a deposit may be made (optional)and when a deposit is necessary, the heading of the rule states both needand opportunity in the alternative.<T3>Comment: </T3>Proposed andSection; 1.201(a) should state that the disclosuremay include reference to a deposit, rather than that the disclosure mayinclude a deposit.<T3>Response: </T3>The suggestion has been adopted in andSection; 1.802(a).<T3>Comment: </T3>Proposed andSection; 1.201(a) does not clearly permit depositswhere conditions enumerated therein do not apply. The proposed rule shouldbe revised by eliminating the requirement that the biological materialnot be known and readily available to the public before a deposit may bemade. The proposed revision would make clear that an applicant has a universaland unconditional right to make a deposit of a biological material wheneverthe biological material cannot be described in writing alone, regardlessof whether the material is known and readily available. The rule as proposedis not consistent with the permissive use of deposits where they mightnot be mandated. The proposed revision would dispel any suggestion or implicationthat the legal standard under which deposits are mandated is that the biologicalmaterial be neither known nor readily available. Obviously, such materialseven if unknown and not readily available might be enabled solely througha written description, rendering deposit unnecessary.<T3>Response: </T3>The suggestion has been adopted in andSection; 1.802(a).In addition, the rule as adopted permits deposits even where the biologicalmaterial can be described in writing alone and even where the claimed inventionis not, or does not rely on, the biological material. Section 1.802(a)as adopted permits reference in the disclosure to a deposit of a biologicalmaterial, the only precondition being that an invention is or relies onthat material. The requirement in the proposed rule that the biologicalmaterial not be known and readily available to the public and not be describablein writing alone, and that the material be, or be used for, the claimedinvention, has not been adopted.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two comments suggest that andSection; 1.201(a) refer to35 U.S.C. 112. One comment suggests that andSection; 1.201(a) should makesome reference to 35 U.S.C. 112 for completeness. Another comment suggeststhat proposed andSection; 1.201(a) contains no standard and should thus makereference to 35 U.S.C. 112, for example, by inserting words to the effectthat the biological material cannot be described in writing alone to satisfythe requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112.<T3>Response: </T3>The suggestions have not been adopted. <T3>But see </T3>the response to the next comment.<T3>Comment: </T3>Proposed andSection; 1.201(b) should be revised by statingthat biological material need not be deposited unless necessary for thesatisfaction of the statutory requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112. Thus, therule would state that the ultimate reason for a requirement for a depositwould be to satisfy 35 U.S.C. 112. Further, the rule should state one circumstance,among others, where a biological material need not be deposited, <T3>viz.</T3>, where it is known and readily available to the public orcan be made or isolated without undue experimentation. The last sentenceof proposed andSection; 1.201(b) should state a precondition that a depositof the biological material be made in a depository complying with theseregulations.<T3>Response: </T3>The suggestions have been adopted in andSection; 1.802(b).<T3>Comment: </T3>Proposed andSection; 1.201(c) should be revised by statingthat the actual deposit of a biological material referred to in a specificationdisclosure also does not create a presumption that the material is necessaryto satisfy 35 U.S.C. 112 or that the deposit is or was required. The proposedrevision would recognize that the act of deposit does not and should notconstitute an admission by the applicant that the deposit was made becauseit was necessary to satisfy 35 U.S.C. 112. For example, deposit may benecessary in the United States prior to the time a patent application isfiled in order for an applicant to be entitled to assert a priority rightunder patent laws of a foreign country based on a United States applicationwhich makes reference to such deposit. Additionally, applicants ought tobe encouraged to make deposits in questionable cases without such act beingconstrued as an admission of any sort.<T3>Response: </T3>The suggestion has been adopted in andSection; 1.803(c).<T3>Comment: </T3>The term ``or other biological material'' in proposedandSection; 1.201(c) should be changed to ``or any other biological material''to make sure that all biological materials that would normally be consideredfor deposits are included.<T3>Response: </T3>The comment is not understood. Nevertheless, it is moot.The term ``specific organism or other biological material'' in proposedandSection; 1.201(c) has been changed to ``biological material'' in andSection;1.802(c) as adopted.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two comments suggest that proposed andSection; 1.202(a)(2)unnecessarily limits who may be consulted in determining the suitabilityof a depository to be recognized by the Office to those in the biotechnologyindustry or Government agencies. Views from academia may be wanted. Oneof the comments suggests, therefore, that the term ``from the biotechnologyindustry or governmental agencies'' be deleted from andSection; 1.202(a)(2).<T3>Response: </T3>The suggestions have been adopted in andSection; 1.803(a)(2).<T3>Comment: </T3>Proposed andSection; 1.202(a) should be revised to statethat a deposit shall be recognized for the purposes of these regulationsif made in a depository according to subparagraph (1) or (2) thereof. Theproposed revision would allow for deposits other than in Office-recognizeddepositories, but give deposits in Office-recognized depositories the ``safeharbor'' advantages of these regulations.<T3>Response: </T3>The suggestion has been adopted in andSection; 1.803(a).Simply put, the rules do not prohibit deposits made under any conceivableconditions. The Office will treat a deposit not made according to theseregulations, however, as if no deposit had been made.<T3>Comment: </T3>The provision set forth in proposed andSection; 1.202(c)(3),i.e., that a depository seeking status under paragraph (a)(2) indicatethat it intends to be available, for the purposes of deposit, to any depositorunder these same conditions, should also be listed in andSection; 1.202(a)(2),which enumerates the qualifications for a depository seeking recognitionas suitable by the Office.<T3>Response: </T3>The suggestion is not being adopted. The requirementin proposed andSection; 1.202(a)(2)(v), and andSection; 1.803(a)(2)(v) as adopted,that the depository be impartial and objective, is inclusive of a requirementthat it be available, for purposes of deposit, to any depositor under thesesame conditions.<T3>Comment: </T3>One comment suggests that the proposed rules do not adequatelydefine the term ``depositor''. It could be the inventor, the assignee,one to whom the inventor has an obligation to assign, or the individualwho signs the deposit form. In the case of joint inventors with differentinstitutional ties, who is the depositor? Assuming that where the inventoris a university professor, the depositor is the university, deposit inthat university's depository would be precluded by proposed andSection; 1.202(a)(2)(ii)and possibly andSection; 1.202(a)(2)(v). An exception should be made fornon-profit organizations. They should be allowed to ``self-deposit'' sinceit is highly improbably that they would refuse to provide samples to thirdparties. The availability of a strain from a university was found to satisfy35 U.S.C. 112 in <T3>Merck and Co., Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Chase Chemical Co.</T3>, 273 F.Supp. 68, 77, 92, 155 USPQ 139, 146,159 (D.N.J. 1967). Another comment suggests that it is not clear, wherethe depositor is a separate, independent division of a particular entityand the depository is another separate, independent division of the sameentity, whether this arrangement meets the terms of proposed andSection;1.202(a)(2)(ii).<T3>Response: </T3>None of the suggestions have been adopted. In andSection;1.803(a)(2)(ii) as adopted, a depository recognized to be suitable by theOffice and not otherwise an IDA must exist independent of the control ofthe depositor. In a response to a comment in the notice of proposed rulemaking,it was stated that the term ``depositor'' is intended to include the partyon whose behalf the deposit is made. It was further stated in that responsethat the rationale of the Office in requiring that a depository, if notan IDA, be independent of the depositor was adequately discussed in theadvance notice of proposed rulemaking. The advance notice stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The concept of an independent depository of an IDA as an acceptabledepository is based on the need and desire to ensure the safe and reliablestorage of a deposited biological material under circumstances that arefree of the opportunity for intentional or negligent handling of the depositedmaterial. The use of an independent depository or an internationally recognizeddepository will tend to preserve the integrity of the deposit process againstthose that may accidentally alter the deposited material, may wish to tamperwith the deposited material or may wish to resume control of its availabilitywhen the patent is no longer enforceable, and to preserve the interestof the public in the free access to the biological material for any purposeonce the term of the patent expires. Further, while the PTO is constrainedto approve independent depositories other than an IDA, the PTO has neitherthe resources nor capability to assess the individual capability of anyparty that wishes to act as its own depository. The rules under considerationare intended to minimize depositories that will be found acceptable.</ITAG>The above discussion applies to non-profit organizations as well as for-profitorganizations. Moreover, it is clear from the discussion above that thescope of the term ``depositor'' is limited only by the requirement thatthe depositor have no control over the depository. Such a relationshipis not necessarily inconsistent with one where there is some legal relationshipbetween depositor and depository. The <T3>Merck </T3>case cited above does not stand for the proposition thata university is necessarily an acceptable depository because it makes availablesamples of a biological material. In <T3>Merck</T3>, the availability of the biological material from the universitywas evidence that the biological material was known and readily available.While a deposit by an applicant in a depository under the applicant's controlwill not be recognized by the Office as a deposit under these regulations,an applicant is not precluded from showing that the deposited material,by virtue of conditions of public knowledge of unrestricted availabilityof samples of the deposit, is known and readily available to the public.However, depositors should be aware that relying on such a showing ratherthan making a deposit according to these regulations involves a risk thatthe biological material might in the future not be readily available. Theuniversity relied on in the <T3>Merck</T3> case, for example, eventually ceased its practice of makingbiological materials readily available.<T3>Comment: </T3>Proposed andSection; 1.202(b) is intended to apply in theevent that a depository ceases to enjoy the status of a recognized depository.The manner of making a substitute deposit in such a situation would notseem to be fully explained by a reference to proposed andSection; 1.204.For example, if a depository were to cease operation, it might not be ableto, in the words of proposed andSection; 1.204(a), ``promptly after havingnoted its inability to furnish samples, notify the depositor of such inability''.Second, the rule as proposed is difficult to follow. For example, it indicatesthat a substitute deposit ``must be viable if the biological material isof a kind capable of self-replication''. The implication that certain depositsmight be non-viable is at best confusing in the absence of a definitionfor viability.<T3>Response: </T3>Proposed andSection; 1.202(b) has not been adopted. Section1.805, the rule as adopted on replacement deposits, puts the burden exclusivelyon the applicant or patent owner, whatever the case may be, to both makea replacement deposit and make the necessary showing that such a depositcomplies with these regulations. Viability is dealt with exclusively byandSection; 1.807 as adopted.<T3>Comment: </T3>Three comments suggest that it be a requirement of therules that the biological material have been in existence at the time offiling the patent application. One comment suggests that a sentence beadded to proposed andSection; 1.208(a) to require that the application asfiled state that the biological material is in existence. The other commentssuggest that proposed andSection; 1.203 require an averment that the depositedbiological material was in existence at the time the application was filed.<T3>Response: </T3>None of the suggestions have been adopted. Patent lawdoes not require an actual reduction to practice as a condition precedentto filing a patent application. While few, if any, situations can be imaginedwhere the description requirement of 35 U.S.C. 112 can be satisfied wherethe biological material was not in existence at the time of filing, therules do not preclude such a situation. <T3>But see </T3>the response to the next comment.<T3>Comment: </T3>Proposed andSection; 1.203(a) should require that a biologicalmaterial may be deposited only if an adequate antecedent basis exists inthe specification as filed, i.e., the biological material to be depositedmust be specifically identified therein. <T3>Response: </T3>The suggestion has been adopted in andSection; 1.804(a).It must be clear from the application as filed that the invention claimedand described in the specification ``was fully capable of being reducedto practice (i.e., no technological problems, the resolution of which wouldrequire more than ordinary skill and reasonable time, remained in orderto obtain an operative, useful process).'' <T3>Feldman </T3>v.<T3> Aunstrup,</T3> 517 F.2d 1351, 1355, 186 USPQ 108, 113 (CCPA 1975),<T3>cert. denied,</T3> 424 U.S. 912 (1976). <T3>Accord, In re Lundak,</T3> 773 F.2d 1216, 1221, 227 USPQ 90, 94 (Fed.Cir. 1985). <T3>Comment: </T3>Two comments suggest that proposed andSection; 1.203(a)be revised so that it addresses the permissible situation where a depositis made during the pendency of an application for patent not pursuant toa requirement made by an examiner. <T3>Response: </T3>The suggestion has been substantially adopted in andSection;1.804(a). An original deposit may be made, subject to andSection; 1.809,during pendency of the application for patent. Where andSection; 1.809 doesnot apply, i.e., where a deposit is ultimately not required, a depositmay be made at anytime during pendency.<T3>Comment: </T3>The Office should discuss in the commentary accompanyingthe notice of proposed andSection; 1.203(b) as a final rule the meaning andintent behind the requirement that the deposited biological material bethe ``same'' as the material described in the specification. For example,does the Office contemplate that the statement constitute a representationthat the deposited material is in essentially the same form as was in existenceat the time of the filing of the patent specification, and, accordinglyas specifically described therein? <T3>Response: </T3>Proposed andSection; 1.203(b) has been adopted as andSection;1.804(b) but with the word ``same'' deleted and the term ``described''replaced with ``specifically identified.'' Under andSection; 1.804(b), thebiological material deposited must be a biological material specificallyidentified in the application as filed.<T3>Comment: </T3>One comment asks whether a patent which is defectivebecause of the lack of a deposit can be rectified by making the depositin connection with a reissue application. Another comment points out thatthe issue of post-grant original deposits is not addressed by these regulationsand the Office is urged to comment to this effect in the final promulgationof the rules. <T3>Response: </T3>It is assumed from the comment that a deposit was necessaryat the time the patent was issued. A patent defective because of lack ofa necessary deposit is necessarily fatally defective for failure to complywith the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112. Reissue is not available insuch cases. <T3>See In re Hay,</T3> 534 F.2d 917, 189 USPQ 790 (CCPA), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>429 U.S. 977 (1976). Whether reissue is availablewhere a biological material necessary for compliance with 35 U.S.C. 112was known and readily available at the time of issuance of the patent andsubsequently ceased to be readily available is not addressed by this response.Nor do the rules address the question of post-issue original deposits,whether necessary or not to comply with the patent statutes.<T3>Comment: </T3>Many comments were received regarding proposed andSection;1.204 and the subject of replacement deposits. One comment suggests thatthe time limits in proposed andSection; 1.204(a) for making replacement deposits,specifically as they apply post-grant, are totally arbitrary. For example,a replacement deposit made four months after notice from the depository,without a suitable petition for extension of time, could not be reliedon. A number of comments suggest that in proposed andSection; 1.204(a), itis not clear who is required to petition whom in order to obtain an extensionof time in which to make a replacement deposit. A depository is not equippedto deal with the legalities of such matters. If the petition is filed withthe Office, there will be administrative burdens. Another comment suggeststhat instead of specified time limits and petitions for extensions of time,the rule should state that where a patentee makes a replacement deposit,the patentee shall promptly request a certificate of correction identifyingthe particulars of the replacement deposit and that no such certificateof correction shall be granted unless the request includes, <T3>inter alia,</T3> a verified showing that the patentee acted diligentlyin making the replacement deposit. A certificate of correction in providingthe particulars of the new deposit (depository and accession number) wouldprovide the simplest and most straightforward vehicle under which the patenteecould assure continuing public notice (and accordingly public access) toparticular biological materials described in the specification. Correctionsto the issued patent would be made subject to all conditions of these depositregulations and an additional specific requirement that the replacementdeposit be made diligently after the notification is received that samplescannot be furnished from the deposit. This generalized requirement of diligenceis preferable to the more rigid and cumbersome procedures set forth inthe rules as proposed.<T3>Response: </T3>The provisions of a three-month time limit for makinga replacement deposit and petitioning for extensions of time to extendthe limit in proposed andSection; 1.204(a) applied by their terms only topatentees or patent owners. These provisions have not been adopted. Exceptin reexamination and reissue applications, it is beyond the rulemakingauthority of the Office to regulate issued patents. Thus, instead of requiringpatent owners to make replacement, or supplemental, deposits and to makethem within a specified time, or to require them to request certificatesof correction, paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of andSection; 1.805 as adoptedspecify that a replacement or supplemental deposit made in connection witha patent, whether or not made during the pendency of an application forreissue patent or a reexamination proceeding or both, shall not be recognizedin any Office proceeding unless the patent owner requests a certificateof correction under andSection; 1.323 provided certain specified conditionsare met, including that the patent owner acted diligently in making thereplacement or supplemental deposit and promptly thereafter requested thecertificate of correction.<T3>Comment: </T3>The rules should indicate that replacement deposits madeduring the pendency of an application will be treated in exactly the sameway as any other deposit made after the filing date. <T3>Response: </T3>The suggestion has been essentially adopted in andSection;1.805(a) which states, <T3>inter alia,</T3> that a replacement or supplemental deposit made inconnection with an application for patent shall be accepted if it meetsthe requirements for making an original deposit under these regulations,including the requirement set forth under andSection; 1.804(b)<T3>Comment: </T3>The rules should address a situation where the depositis of a non-viable biological material, such as a marine sponge or othermarine macroorganism. Filling requests for samples can ultimately consumethe entire deposit. Two other comments suggest that a depositor be permittedto charge the requesting party a fee sufficient to cover the cost of replacingthe deposit. A competitor could ``drain off'' the store of deposit andthereby require replacement at significant economic hardship to the depositor.<T3>Response: </T3>Where the biological material deposited is capable ofself-replication either directly or indirectly, exhaustion of the depositwould appear to be highly unlikely. Regardless of the type of biologicalmaterial deposited, however, the depositor must assure that samples thereofbe available beyond the enforceable life of any patent relying on the material.<T3>Comment: </T3>Nothing in the regulations which define the suitabilityof a depository requires that the depository itself must provide noticeto depositors in the event of an inability to furnish samples yet proposedandSection;1.204(a) does. <T3>Response: </T3>The suggestion has been adopted in andSection;1.803(a)(2)(vii).<T3>Comment: </T3>A number of comments suggest that the legal ramificationsof an additional deposit made pursuant to proposed andSection;1.204(h), i.e.,made where an earlier deposit has become contaminated or has lost its capabilityto function as described in the specification, are not clear. Some of thesame comments go on to suggest that the deposit provided for in andSection;1.204(h)be termed a ``supplemental'' deposit rather than an ``additional'' depositto emphasize the relationship between it and the earlier deposit, thatsuch a deposit have the same legal effect as the earlier deposit providedthe patent holder provides a verified statement that it is identical tothe earlier deposit, and that it have the same accession number as theearlier deposit, perhaps with a suffix modification. One comment suggeststhat the rules require that a deposit under paragraph (h) be assigned thesame accession number but with an appropriate suffix. A depository commentatorasks that where a deposit under paragraph (h) is made, which deposit_theearlier or the later one_should be made available to the public. Currently,this deposit advises a requesting party that there are two deposits. <T3>Response: </T3>The suggestion of replacing the term ``additional''with the term ``supplemental'' has been adopted but in a somewhat differentsetting. Whereas proposed andSection;1.204(h) stated that nothing in theregulations was intended to prohibit a patentee from making an additionaldeposit, paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (f) and (g) of andSection;1.805 as adoptedprovide for patent owners as well as patent applicants making supplementaldeposits of a biological material earlier deposited from which a depositorycan still furnish samples. These paragraphs provide for supplemental depositssimilar to the provisions in these paragraphs for replacement deposits,including the requirement of showing diligence in making the deposit inconnection with a patent, except that instead of making the deposit afterreceiving notice that samples could no longer be furnished from an earlierdeposit, as in the case of a replacement deposit, the deposit is made afterreceiving notice that the earlier deposit had become contaminated or hadlost its capability to function as described in the specification. Whilethe rules specify that the Office in any Office proceeding will recognizesupplemental deposits if made under certain conditions, it is not knownwhat legal effect a court will give to such recognition. As far as whataccession number a depository should give to a supplemental deposit, thisis a matter within the discretion of the depository. As to which deposit,either an earlier deposit or a supplemental deposit, should be made availableto the public, this would depend on the accession number requested. A supplementaldeposit made according to these regulations would be freely available tothe public to the same extent as an original deposit made according tothese regulations. Obviously, nothing in these regulations prohibits adepository from advising a requesting party that there is more than onedeposit of a particular biological material. <T3>Comment: </T3>To the extent proposed andSection;1.204 regulates the effectson patents, in other than certain statutorily defined situations such asreexamination and reissue, for failure to make replacement deposits accordingto the rule, it exceeds the rulemaking authority of the Office. An exampleis proposed andSection;1.204(c). <T3>Response:</T3> Section 1.805 as adopted, to the extent it addressesreplacement deposits made by patent owners, contains no affirmative provisionsrequiring or prohibiting replacement deposits. Rather, it prescribes whatan applicant or patent owner may do vis-a-vis the Office if a replacementdeposit is made and what the ramifications are in any Office proceedingif a replacement deposit is not made or improperly made. Proposed andSection;1.204(c)was, and andSection;1.805(d) as adopted is, limited to Office proceedings.The provision that a patentee may not replace a viable deposit where thedepository can furnish samples in proposed andSection;1.204(h) has been replacedin andSection;1.805(i) as adopted with the provision that the Office willnot recognize in any Office proceeding a replacement deposit made by apatent owner where the depository could furnish samples of the depositbeing replaced.<T3>Comment:</T3> One comment suggests that the term of deposit in proposedandSection;1.205 is excessive. The term should be through the expirationof the patent plus 10 years. Another comment suggests that andSection;1.205be adopted except that the last sentence should be deleted and the term``viable'' before ``deposit''be dropped. The term ``viable'' should bedeleted as viability is dealt with elsewhere, e.g., proposed andSection;1.206.The last sentence should be deleted because, while the Office may set whatit considers adequate terms of deposit on or before patent grant, it hasno statutory authority or mechanism for supervising the term of the agreementof the deposit. The last sentence is also highly indefinite in failingto indicate how far beyond the enforceable life of a patent the depositmust be maintained.<T3>Response:</T3> The suggestions have been adopted in part. ProposedandSection;1.205, including the last sentence, has been adopted as andSection;1.806except that the thirty-year term applies to any deposit made before orduring pendency of an application for patent. No requirement of viabilityis stated in the rule. The Office agrees that once a patent issues, ithas no authority or mechanism for supervising the term of the agreementof the deposit. But the Office does have the authority to set the termof deposit while an application is still pending. That is all andSection;1.806does. In almost all cases, the term of deposit as set forth in the firstsentence of andSection;1.806 will extend beyond the enforceable life of thepatent for which a deposit was made. The last sentence of andSection;1.806is intended to cover those rare circumstances where extended prosecutionin the Office results in expiration of the term of deposit as set forthin the first sentence while the patent is still enforceable. At this time,there appears to be no need to specify any finite time period beyond theenforceable life of a patent. If experience demonstrates that the publicinterest is not being served by the present provisions, an appropriateamendment will be proposed.<T3>Comment:</T3> A depository commentator suggests that the requirementin proposed andSection;1.207(b)(1) that a request for a sample of the depositedmaterial be signed poses an administrative burden on depositories whichaccept telephone, telex and electronic mail requests for samples. Requiringthat a request be signed can and will delay the receipt of samples by manydays. The signing requirement should not be adopted.<T3>Response:</T3> The suggestion has been adopted in andSection;1.808(b)(1).<T3>Comment:</T3> A depository commentator suggests that the requirementin proposed andSection;1.207(b)(3) that a copy of the request be providedto the depositor poses a problem since most requests also include a requestfor samples of many other deposited biological materials. For such a request,it would be necessary to send a copy to each depositor, blanking out theother deposits not made by that depositor. It should be sufficient thatthe depositor is notified to whom and the date a sample was provided. Thecost will be much greater if a copy has to be supplied.<T3>Response:</T3> The suggestion has been adopted in andSection;1.808(b)(3).<T3>Comment:</T3> A depository commentator suggests that in proposed andSection;1.207(b),it is not clear, after the term of the patent, whether the deposit is againrestricted as it was before the patent was granted, i.e., not furnishedunless the requesting party has the proper authorization from the depositoror the Commissioner, or whether the deposit is no longer subject to subparagraphs(1), (2) and (3) thereof and can be furnished without any specific identificationor notification. It is suggested that either a statement be added as towhat happens after the term of the patent or the term ``during the termof the patent'' be deleted.<T3>Response:</T3> The suggestions have not been adopted. Section 1.808(a)(2)requires that subject to paragraph (b) thereof, all restrictions imposedby the depositor or the availability to the public of the deposited materialwill be irrevocably removed upon the granting of the patent. Paragraph(b), by its terms, is limited to the term of the patent. A contract betweena depositor and a depository according to paragraph (b) but which extendsbeyond the term of the patent would violate paragraph (a)(2). It shouldbe self-evident that for deposits in compliance with these regulations,samples of the deposit may be furnished without any specific identificationor notification for requests made after the term of the patent.<T3>Comment:</T3> While many comments suggest adoption of a rule restrictingthe transfer of a sample of a deposited material to a third party withoutthe depositor's permission, such as proposed andSection;1.207(c), as wellas the adoption of a rule requiring other restrictions on access to depositedmaterial, two comments suggest that such rules not be adopted. The rationaleis that if a deposit is basically a replacement for that which could notbe adequately written in the patent specification itself, no specific statutoryauthority exists for restricting access to the deposited material any morethan the patent law would countenance restrictions on access to the writtendescription itself. If abuses exist by virtue of the absence of limitationson access to deposited materials, then the remedy for patent infringementis as applicable to deposited material as it is to infringers acting fromknowledge of the written description itself. Accordingly, unrestrictedaccess to deposits should be allowed. One of the comments suggests furtherthat if there are to be some restrictions to access, proposed andSection;1.207(c)is otherwise problematic and ineffective. For example, the limitation onaccess applies to ``derived'' materials which could include wholly noninfringingderivatives which might themselves constitute a patentable invention ofa third party requester. The proposed rule would deny the third party requesterthe right to what ought to be an unrestricted right to sell or otherwisedispose of this derivative material to third parties. Moreover, the proposedrule is remediless since the Office neither has continuing jurisdictionover the patentee nor a third party requester. Two depository commentatorsexpressed reservations about proposed andSection;1.207(c). One suggests thatthe first sentence therein is in direct contradiction to the long-standingpolicies of both NRRL and ATCC. Most depositories no longer require thistype of guarantee from requesting parties as they find it almost impossibleto enforce. The other suggests that the administrative burden to the depositoryin handling agreements made pursuant to the proposed rule will be greatand the cost will be borne by the depositor. At $10 an agreement and 300requests a year for a particular deposit, the cost to the depositor wouldbe $3,000 a year. If andSection;1.207(c) is adopted, there should be somemention that if a depository charges a fee for this service, the fee mustbe paid or the depository will not be obligated to provide the service.In the European Patent Office (EPO), which has a similar provision, theEPO, not the depository, obtains the agreement and advises the depositoryto make the sample available. The comment asks if the Office is preparedto do this. Additional comments ask what rules govern a new deposit forpatent purposes of the same or derived biological material by a requestingparty if the substance of proposed andSection;1.207(c) is adopted. Some commentswere in response to a solicitation in the notice of proposed rulemakingfor alternative approaches and suggestions for an appropriate definitionof ``essential characteristics'' with respect to derived material in proposedandSection;1.207(c).<T3>Response: </T3>The Office has decided not to adopt a rule permittinga depositor to require that a sample of a deposited biological materialshall be furnished only if the requesting party has agreed not to makethe material or a derivative thereof available to a third party withoutthe depositor's permission. Thus, proposed andSection; 1.207(c) has not beenadopted. The Office agrees with many of the comments about shortcomingsin the proposed rule. Fundamentally, however, the proposed rule has notbeen adopted in view of the rationale stated in the comment that no greaterrestriction on access to a deposit should be permitted than is permittedon access to the written description itself, even considering that thepractical value of access to a deposit may be substantially greater thanaccess to the written description and that infringement may be more difficultto police. While it might be argued that the adoption of proposed andSection;1.207(b)with revisions as andSection;1.808(b) is inconsistent with this rationale,the Office believes that permitting the depositor to require a requestingparty, in essence, to identify itself is not unreasonable under the circumstancesand is consistent with international practice as embodied in the BudapestTreaty.<T3>Comment: </T3>Many comments which suggest the adoption of the substanceof proposed andSection;1.207(c) also suggest the adoption of rules incorporatingthe recommendations made in the April 8, 1987 World Intellectual PropertyOrganization (WIPO) report on the Industrial Property Protection of BiotechnologicalInventions (1) to use the biological material only for experimental purposesconcerning the invention, and (2) not to export the biological materialexcept to a country for which a relevant patent has been granted. The reasonsgenerally given were that it is necessary to protect the patentee and enhancethe patentee's ability to enforce a patent relying on a deposited material.One comment suggests that incorporating the recommendation on experimentaluse would clarify what is permitted by law. In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,53 FR at 39423-24, the Office described the difficulties in drafting aregulation incorporating these recommendations and requested specific suggestionsas to how to draft a regulation which both accomplishes the intended purposeand is not inconsistent with law. No specific suggestions were received,although one comment suggests that where a deposited material is coveredby an unexpired U.S. patent, a rule be adopted permitting the depositorto require the requesting party to agree to comply with the provisionsof 35 U.S.C. 271. Another comment suggests that legislation is necessaryto deal with the problems addressed by the WIPO recommendations. A restrictionagainst exports could be considered to be violative of 35 U.S.C. 112 sinceforeign requesters would be denied access to deposits where a patenteehad never sought foreign patent protection. A restriction to experimentalpurposes only, while more justifiable, raises two problems. One is that``experimental purposes'' have not been defined and the term has been opento several interpretations. The other is that the proper redress for non-experimentaluse is a suit for patent infringement, not a suit based on the requester'spromise to the depository. The comment suggests that a rule be adoptedpermitting the depositor to require that a requesting party acknowledgethat the furnishing of a sample of the deposited biological material doesnot constitute a license, express or implied, to use that sample for anypurpose.<T3>Response: </T3>None of the suggestions have been adopted for essentiallythe same rationale discussed in the response to the previous comment. Nonesuggest how to draft a regulation which both accomplishes the intendedpurpose and is not inconsistent with law, and which provides a compellingjustification and rationale for departing from present policy and practice.The suggestion that a requesting party agree to comply with 35 U.S.C. 271as a condition precedent to obtaining a sample of deposited biologicalmaterial is interpreted as an agreement not to infringe a correspondingvalid patent, something which a requesting party is already bound not todo under law. The suggestion that a depositor be permitted to require arequesting party to acknowledge that there is no express or implied licenseto use a sample for any purpose exceeds the rulemaking authority of theOffice since certain unlicensed uses of patented subject matter have beenfound by the courts to be permissible.<T3>Comment: </T3>Many of the comments suggesting adoption of the substanceof andSection;1.207(c) and/or the WIPO recommendations on experimental useand export also suggest adoption of rules permitting additional restrictions.One comment suggests requiring the recipient of biological material toreport, at least annually, to the patent holder, on the research and otherresults obtained by use of the biological material. The same commentatorsuggests that even after patent expiration, an unlicensed recipient shouldnot be permitted to use the biological material for other than experimentalpurposes absent agreement from the depositor. The commentator would prohibitcommercial use of the biological material without permission of the depositor.Another comment suggests that the policy consideration for permitting depositsis to insure that the patented invention can be practiced after patentexpiration. Requiring a requesting party to enter into an agreement withthe depositor defining the terms and conditions under which a sample ofthe deposited material would be used, making an accounting of such use,and proof of compliance, is neither unreasonable nor contrary to law. Itwould not place an administrative burden on the Office since the depositorycould be permitted to release samples only if the requesting party signsa license. Any attempt by the depositor to impose an unlawful restrictionand withhold release would be a matter for the courts, not the Office.Another comment suggests various additional restricitons be adopted. Theseare (1) that the requesting party have residence in the U.S. or in thecountry where the depository is located, if different; (2) that the patenteebe given the option to restrict furnishing of samples to independent expertsonly for the duration of the patent; and (3) that the deposit be releasedonly if the depositor expressly consents (in the absence of which validityof the patent must be resolved without recourse to the deposit). Restriction(1) should be adopted so that the deposit cannot be legally exported toa country where the patent owner has no enforceable rights. Restriction(2) should be adopted to prevent access of the deposited material to potentialinfringers. Its adoption should be coupled with a statement that a depositreleased to an expert shall be regarded as being available to the public.Restriction (3) should be adopted as an extension to the description inproposed andSection;1.201 that the disclosure ``may include a deposit.''In other words, the patentee at any time during the patent term shouldbe able to rely on the written description alone for satisfying 35 U.S.C.112, such as where the reasons for requiring a deposit originally no longerexist.<T3>Response: </T3>None of the suggestions have been adopted for essentiallythe same reasons discussed in the responses to the previous two comments.<T3>Comment: </T3>A depository commentator suggests that proposed andSection;1.207(d)needs further deliberation. Now, publication in a U.S. patent of a depositand accession number is sufficient for that depository (ATCC) to make samplesavailable. The Office should be prepared to receive several thousand requestsfor certification under andSection;1.207(d) if adopted. If the Office isgoing to certify the availability of deposits, it should certify the availabilityof all deposits. Easier than the proposed rule would be to include a statementin the patent that there is a deposit, its accession number and where itis deposited, and that it has been made under the condition that it isavailable upon publication of the issued patent.<T3>Response: </T3>The suggestion has not been adopted. The comment appearsto be interpreting the term ``Upon request'' at the beginning of proposedandSection;1.207(d) to mean ``Upon request to a depository for a sample ofa deposited material'', or in other words, the commentator appears to haveinterpreted the proposed language as requiring the depository to requestcertification from the Office each time a request for a sample of a depositis made. It was not intended to impose such a burden on depositories. Rather,it was intended that the term ``Upon request'' refer to a request madeto the Office. Therefore, proposed andSection;1.207(d), revised by insertingthe term ``made to the Office'' after ``Upon request'', has been adoptedas andSection;1.808(c).<T3>Comment: </T3>One comment suggests that there is no apparent reasonfor the use of the different words ``[e]stablishing'' and ``[a]rguing'',in proposed paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3), respectively, of andSection;1.208since the same meaning is intended by each. Either word alone should beused in both subparagraphs (2) and (3). The same comment goes on to suggestthat the reference to paragraph (b)(2) in the last sentence of proposedandSection;1.208(b)(3) is redundant since the examiner may be convinced thata deposit is not required where the applicant has established that theinvolved biological material is known and readily available to the public.A comment along the same lines suggests that paragraph (b)(2) is unnecessary.As a purely logical matter, an applicant ought to be entitled to replyto a rejection either by making an acceptable deposit or arguing why adeposit is not required under the circumstances. Proposed andSection;1.208(b)(2)is merely one possibility for an argument that a deposit is not required.<T3>Response: </T3>The suggestions have been adopted. Proposed andSection;1.208(b)(2)has not been adopted and proposed andSection;1.208(b)(3) has been substantiallyadopted as andSection;1.809(b)(2). In addition, andSection;1.809(b)(2) providesfor examination with respect to a patent, since deposit issues may arisein connection with a reissue application and/or a reexamination proceeding,and provides also for an argument that a deposit actually made should beaccepted.<T3>Comment: </T3>A number of comments suggest that the term ``taxonomicdescription'' in proposed andSection; 1.208(d)(3) is unclear and inappropriatein some cases. One comment suggests that it is not clear how complete adescription is required. If construed in its broadest sense, it could havethe undesirable effect of delaying filing of an application until taxonomiccharacteristics have been determined. Some biological materials withinthe scope of the proposed rules, such as plasmids, are not susceptibleof taxonomic description. The requirement that the specification containa taxonomic description should not be adopted since such a descriptionmay not be possible and since the availability of a deposit makes sucha description superfluous, since the taxonomy is inherent in the deposit.The response to comments made earlier regarding the taxonomic descriptionrequirement is inconsistent with the proposed rule. The response statesthat the extent to which a taxonomic description is required will dependon the facts of the case yet the proposed rule states that the specificationshall contain such a description. The response states that the taxonomicdescription must be sufficient for purposes of 35 U.S.C. 112 yet the requirementof a deposit presupposes that a written description alone will not satisfythe statute. The need to verify that the deposited biological materialis that disclosed in the specification arises only when the deposit ismade after the filing date. That situation can be dealt with by deletingthe taxonomic description requirement from andSection; 1.208(d) and addinga new subparagraph (e) which would provide that in cases where a depositis made after the filing date and where the nature of the material permits,a taxonomic description is required in addition to the items specifiedin subparagraph (d). Another comment suggests that the term ``taxonomic''be deleted since it is irrelevant to many types of deposits and would providegreater clarity to the rules. Another comment suggests that the currentlanguage in proposed andSection; 1.208(d)(3) be replaced with ``Fully identifyand describe the deposited material''.<T3>Response: </T3>The suggestions have been adopted in part. Section 1.809(d)(3)as adopted requires a description of the deposited biological materialsufficient to specifically identify it and to permit examination. Whilethe rule does not by its terms require a taxonomic description, such adescription should satisfy the rule as adopted in cases where the biologicalmaterial deposited admits of a taxonomic description.<T3>Comment: </T3>The Office should petition the Budapest Assembly to addressthe same issues dealt with in the proposed rules so that they apply toboth U.S. and foreign filings. Uniformity in the rules is important, especiallyfor U.S. inventors who file here and abroad.<T3>Response: </T3>While uniformity in both U.S. and foreign rules is desirable,this is not deemed to be the appropriate forum in which to address thesuggestion.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Specific Sections</ITAG>Biological Material (Section 1.801)The section indicates that the rules pertaining to deposits for purposesof patents for inventions under 35 U.S.C. 101 are intended to relate tobiological material. For the purposes of these rules, the term ``biologicalmaterial'' is defined in terms of a non-exhaustive list of representativematerials which can be deposited in accordance with the procedures definedin these rules. Since these rules are intended to address procedural mattersin the deposit of biological material for patent purposes, and are notdesigned to decide such substantive issues such as whether a deposit ofa particular organism or material would be recognized or needed to be madefor the purposes of satisfying the statutory requirements for patentabilityunder 35 U.S.C. 112, the definition provided in this section is intendedto be permissive_specifically defining materials which can be deposited.Biological material includes material that is capable of self-replicationeither directly or indirectly. Direct self-replication includes those situationswhere the biological material reproduces by itself. Representative examplesof materials capable of self-replication are defined in the rule. Indirectself-replication is meant to include those situations where the biologicalmaterial is only capable of replication when another self-replicating biologicalmaterial is present. Self-replication after insertion in a host is oneexample of indirect self-replication. Examples of indirect replicatingbiological materials include viruses, phages, plasmids, symbionts, andreplication defective cells. The list of representative examples of eachtype of replicating material includes viruses to demonstrate that the listsare not intended to be mutually exclusive.Although plant material is included within the scope of the definitionof biological material for purposes of patents for inventions under 35U.S.C. 101, these rules on deposits are not applicable to applicationsfiled under the Plant Patent Act (35 U.S.C. 161-164). The Office is ofthe view that a deposit is not required under the present provisions of35 U.S.C. 162. Thus, no plant patent granted under the provisions of 35U.S.C. 161-164 need be supported by a deposit. As with other biologicalmaterial deposited for purposes of patents for inventions under 35 U.S.C.101, the deposit of plant material together with the written specificationmust enable those skilled in the art to make and use the claimed invention.As with some types of reproducible biological material, seeds can be reproducedonly after a growing season which may be relatively long. Although therules do not specify a specific number of seeds to be deposited to meetthe requirements of these rules, the Office will consider 2500 to be aminimum number in the normal case, but will give an applicant the opportunityto provide justification why a lesser number would be suitable under thecircumstances of a particular case. The Department of Agriculture requiresa deposit of 2500 seeds for the grant of a Plant Variety Protection Certificate.As the reproduction of seeds will often take a substantial period of time,the Office will require, at a minimum, a number of seeds that is likelyto satisfy demand for samples once the patent is granted.Section 1.801 does not attempt to identify what biological material eitherneeds to be or may be deposited to comply with the requirements of 35 U.S.C.112. For the most part, this issue must be addressed on a case-by-casebasis. Thus, while the Office does not presently contemplate that therewould be any situations where a material that is not capable of self-replicationeither directly or indirectly would be acceptable as a deposit, an applicantis clearly not precluded in any given application, by these rules, fromattempting to show why the deposit of such a material should be acceptableto satisfy the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112.Need or Opportunity to Make a Deposit (Section 1.802)This section permits a deposit of a biological material to be referencedin a patent application where an invention is, or relies on, a biologicalmaterial. The invention may rely on a biological material for the purposesof making or using the invention, either as a preferred mode or an alternativemode of operation. It is not necessary, for the purposes of paragraph (a),that a deposit be required to satisfy the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112before a reference to a deposit is permitted in the specification.There is no necessary implication or presumption that can or should bemade about the need for a deposit simply because reference to a depositis made in an application disclosure. As noted in paragraph (b), biologicalmaterial need not be deposited unless access to such material is necessaryfor the satisfaction of the statutory requirements for patentability under35 U.S.C. 112 and that access is not otherwise available in the absenceof a deposit. Where a deposit is required to provide the necessary access,a deposit is acceptable for patent purposes only where it is made in accordancewith these regulations. Even where access to biological material is requiredto satisfy these statutory requirements, a deposit may not be necessaryif access sufficient to satisfy these requirements is otherwise available.For example, applicant could show that the biological material is knownand readily available to the public. The concepts of ``known and readilyavailable'' are considered to reflect a level of public accessibility toa necessary component of an invention disclosure that is consistent withan ability to make and use the invention. To avoid the need for a depositon this basis, the biological material must be both known and readily available_neitherconcept alone is sufficient. A material may be known in the sense thatits existence has been published, but is not available to those who wishto obtain that particular known biological material. Likewise, a biologicalmaterial may be available in the sense that those having possession ofit would make it available upon request, but no one has been informed ofits existence.By showing that a biological material is known and readily available orby making a deposit in accordance with these rules, applicant does notguarantee that such biological material will be available forever. Publicaccess during the term of the patent may affect the enforceability of thepatent. Although there is a public interest in the availability of a depositedbiological material during and after the period of enforceability of thepatent, the examiner need not be unduly concerned about continued accessto the public. Unless there is a reasonable basis to believe that the biologicalmaterial will cease to be available during the life of the patent, theexaminer should accept current availability as satisfying the requirement.The incentives provided by the patent system should not be constrainedby the mere possibility that a disclosure that was once enabling wouldbecome non-enabling over a period of time through no fault of the patentee.<T3>In re Metcalfe, </T3>410 F.2d 1378, 161 USPQ 789 (CCPA 1969).There are many factors that may be used as indicia that a biological materialis known and readily available to the public. Relevant factors includecommercial availability, references to the biological material in printedpublications, declarations of accessibility by those working in the field,evidence of predictable isolation techniques, or an existing deposit madein accordance with these rules. Each factor may or may not be sufficientalone to demonstrate that the biological material is known and readilyavailable. Those applicants that rely on evidence of accessibility otherthan a deposit take the risk that the patent may no longer be enforceableif the biological material necessary to satisfy the requirements of 35U.S.C. 112 ceases to become accessible.The Office will accept commercial availability as evidence that a biologicalmaterial is known and readily available only when the evidence is clearand convincing that the public has access to the material. A product couldbe commercially available but only at a price that effectively eliminatesaccessibility to those desiring to obtain a sample. The relationship betweenan applicant relying on a biological material and the commercial supplierrelied upon is one factor that would be considered in determining whetherthe biological material was known and readily available. However, the merefact that the biological material was available only through the patentholder or the patent holder's agents or assigns shall not, by itself, justifya finding that the necessary material is not readily available, absentreason to believe that access to the biological material would later beimproperly restricted.The mere reference to a deposit or the biological material itself in anydocument or publication does not necessarily mean that the deposited biologicalmaterial is readily available. Even a deposit made under the Budapest Treatyand referenced in a United States or foreign patent document would notnecessarily meet the test for known and readily available unless the depositwas made under conditions which are consistent with those specified inthese rules, including the one that requires, with one possible exception,that all restrictions on the accessibility will be irrevocably removedupon the granting of the patent.Applicant may show that a deposit is not necessary even though specificbiological materials are required to practice the invention if those biologicalmaterials can be made or isolated without undue experimentation. Depositsmay be required to support the claims if an isolation procedure requiresundue experimentation to obtain the desired biological material. <T3>Ex Parte Jackson, </T3>217 USPQ 804 (PTO Bd. Pat. App. 1982) No depositis required, however, where the required biological materials can be obtainedfrom publicly available material with only routine experimentation anda reliable screening test. <T3>Tabuchi </T3>v. <T3>Nubel, </T3>559 F.2d 1183, 194 USPQ 521 (CCPA 1977); <T3>Ex Parte Hata, </T3>6 USPQ 2d 1652 (PTO Bd. Pat. App. andamp; Int. 1987).Once a deposit is made in a depository complying with these rules, andunder conditions complying with these rules, a biological material willbe considered to be readily available even though some requirement of lawor regulation in the United States or in the country where the depositoryinstitution is located permits access to the material only under conditionsimposed for health, safety or similar reasons. This provision is consistentwith the Budapest Treaty (Article 5) and is designed to permit the patentingof inventions involving materials having restricted distribution, wherethe restrictions are imposed for the public, as opposed to the private,welfare.Paragraph (c) specifically provides that the mere reference to a depositof biological material in the specification disclosure or the actual depositof such material does not create any presumption that such referenced ordeposited material is necessary to satisfy 35 U.S.C. 112, or that a depositin accordance with these regulations is or was required. Since referenceto a biological material cannot be added to a specification disclosureafter filing an application without risking the prohibited introductionof new matter (35 U.S.C. 132), applicants must be permitted to addressthe need to make a deposit in accordance with these regulations withoutjeopardizing a filing date. Thus, the examiner has the burden of showingthat a deposit is required to satisfy 35 U.S.C. 112, and cannot rely onwhether a deposit has been made or has been referenced in the specificationdisclosure to establish a <T3>prima facie </T3>case that the disclosure does not comply with 35 U.S.C.112 without a deposit.Acceptable Depository (Section 1.803)This section indicates that a depository will be recognized as acceptablefor the purposes of these regulations if it is either an InternationalDepositary Authority (IDA) established under the Budapest Treaty, or ifit is a depository recognized as suitable by the Commissioner. After theeffective date of these regulations, a deposit of biological material whichis made in a depository which is not recognized as acceptable under thisregulation will not be considered as satisfying the requirements of 35U.S.C. 112. On the other hand, if a deposit is not required to satisfythe requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112, it is permissible to make referenceto such a deposit even though it may not be in a depository or made underthe conditions which are acceptable under these regulations. As new depositoriesare accepted under the Budapest Treaty or are recognized as suitable bythe Commissioner, their identity will be announced in the Official Gazette.An organization may be recognized as suitable by the Office if the procedureand conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) are followed. Generally,it is not the intention of the Office to recognize as suitable any organizationwhere the need for a suitable depository for patent purposes is being metby depositories recognized as IDAs under the Budapest Treaty. Suitabilitywill be judged by the Commissioner, based on need and the information suppliedby the organization seeking status, and information obtained from othersources that may be consulted. While there is a desire to provide flexibility to a patent applicant inselecting an appropriate depository, these rules are not intended to permiteach patent applicant to become its own depository since both the patentowner and the public have an interest in the continued availability andaccessibility of the deposit during the enforceable life of the patent,and the public has a continuing interest in its availability when the patentis no longer enforceable. The concept of a depository independent of thecontrol of the depositor or an IDA as an acceptable depository is basedon the need and desire to ensure the safe and reliable storage of a depositedbiological material under circumstances that are substantially free ofthe opportunity for intentional or negligent handling of the depositedmaterial. The use of an independent depository or internationally recognizeddepository will tend to preserve the integrity of the deposit process againstthose that may accidentally alter the deposited material, may wish to tamperwith the deposited material or may wish to resume control of its availabilitywhen the patent is no longer enforceable, and to preserve the interestof the public in the access to the biological material once the term ofthe patent expires. When a depository having status under paragraph (a)(2) of this regulationseeks to change the kinds of biological materials that it will accept andmaintain for the purposes of these rules, a communication requesting sucha change should be directed to the Commissioner containing the informationrequested in paragraph (b). When such a change is requested, the requestingorganization should provide a complete list of the kinds of biologicalmaterials it will accept. Paragraph (d) of this section indicates that once a depository is recognizedas suitable for the purposes of this rule, or has defaulted or discontinuedits performance under this section, notice thereof will be published inthe Official Gazette of the Patent and Trademark Office.

Paragraph (a) specifies not only a permissibletime frame for making an original deposit, but also specifies that thebiological material deposited must be specifically identified in the applicationfor patent as filed. The requirement for a specific identification is consistentwith the description requirement of the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112,and to provide an antecedent basis for the biological material which eitherhas been or will be deposited before the patent is granted. The description in the Lundak application as filed (now patent 4,594,325)provides a suitable illustration of the specific identification and descriptionwhich is required in an application for patent as filed. In that application,an immortal B-cell line was disclosed and claimed. The cell line was referredto in the application as filed as WI-L2-729 HF2. The methods of obtainingand using this cell line were also described in the application as filed.A deposit of the cell line was made with the American Type Culture Collection(ATCC) about a week after the application was filed in the United States.The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that therequirements of access by the Office to a sample of the cell line duringpendency, and public access after grant, were met by Lundak's procedures.The Court further held that the addition of information designating thedepository, accession number, and deposit date of the deposited cell linein ATCC after the filing date did not violate the prohibition against newmatter in 35 U.S.C. 132. <T3>In re Lundak</T3>, 773 F.2d 1216, 227 USPQ 90 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Itmust be clear from the application as filed that the invention claimedand described in the specification ``was fully capable of being reducedto practice (i.e., no technological problems, the resolution of which wouldrequire more than ordinary skill and reasonable time, remained in orderto obtain an operative, useful process).'' <T3>Feldman </T3>v. <T3>Aunstrup</T3>, 517 F.2d 1351, 1355, 186 USPQ 108, 113 (CCPA 1975),<T3>cert. denied</T3>, 424 U.S. 912 (1976). When the original deposit is made after the effective filing date of anapplication for patent, applicant is required to promptly submit a verifiedstatement from a person in a position to corroborate that the biologicalmaterial which is deposited is a biological material specifically identifiedin the application (the filing date of which is relied upon) as filed.The nature of this corroboration will depend on the circumstances in theparticular application under consideration, including the length of timebetween the application filing date and the date of deposit. While few,if any, situations can be imagined where the description requirement of35 U.S.C. 112 can be satisfied where the biological material was not inexistence at the time of filing, the rules do not preclude such a situation.There is no requirment in the patent law that an actual reduction to practiceoccur as a condition precedent to filing a patent application. The requirementfor a verified statement is not necessary under paragraph (b) of this sectionif the person making the statement is an attorney or agent registered topractice before the Office. For the purposes of complying with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112, adeposit of a biological material may be made at any time before filingthe application for patent or during the pendency of the application subjectto the conditions of andSection;1.809. Where the deposit is needed to satisfythe requirement of 35 U.S.C. 112 and is made during the pendency of theapplication, it must be made no later than the time period set by the examinerat the time the Notice of Allowance and Issue Fee Due is mailed. A necessarydeposit need not be made by applicant until the application is in conditionfor allowance so long as applicant provides a written assurance that anacceptable deposit will be made on or before the payment of the issue fee.This written assurance must provide sufficiently detailed information toconvince the examiner that there is no outstanding issue regarding depositsthat needs to be resolved. Those applicants intending to file patent applications in a country foreignto the United States relying upon biological material that must be depositedto satisfy the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112 when the application is filedin the United States are cautioned that in many countries the deposit mustbe made before the filing date of the priority application in order toobtain foreign priority rights. Thus, while the deposit of a biologicalmaterial subsequent to the effective filing date of a United States applicationis sufficient to comply with 35 U.S.C. 112, an applicant may not be ableto rely on the filing date of such a U.S. application if a patent is soughtin a country foreign to the United States. Replacement or Supplement of Deposit (Section 1.805)This section relates to the deposit of a biological material to replaceor supplement a previous deposit. The term ``replacement'' is directedto those situations where one deposit is being substituted for another.An applicant may have greater latitude in replacing a deposit during thependency of an application than after the patent is granted. Replacementwill typically take place where the earlier deposit is no longer viable.The term ``supplement'' is directed to those situations where the earlierdeposit is still viable in the sense that it is alive and capable of replicationeither directly or indirectly, but has lost a quality (e.g., purity, functionality)it allegedly possessed at the time the application was filed. The proceduresin these rules contemplate that only the original depositor would havea right to replace or supplement the original deposit.Paragraph (a) relates to the procedure for replacing or supplementing adeposit with respect to a pending application or a patent. An applicantfor patent or patent owner whose patent is the subject of a reissue applicationor reexamination proceeding is required to notify the Office when it obtainsinformation that the depository possessing a deposit either cannot furnishsamples thereof or can furnish samples thereof but the deposit has becomecontaminated or has lost its capabilty to function as described in thespecification. When the Office is so notified or otherwise becomes awareof such information, the need for making a replacement or supplementaldeposit will be determined by the same considerations used to determinethe need for an original deposit under andSection; 1.802(b).A replacement or supplemental deposit made in connection with a pendingapplication for patent will be accepted if it meets all the requirementsfor making an original deposit. It should be noted that for a pending applicationfor patent, applicant need not replace or supplement the identical materialpreviously deposited, but may make an original deposit of a biologicalmaterial which is specifically identified and described in the applicationas filed. Whether this alternative deposit will meet the requirements of35 U.S.C. 112 with respect to the claimed subject matter must be resolvedby the examiner on a case-by-case basis.A replacement or supplemental deposit made in connection with a patent,whether or not it is the subject of a pending reissue application or reexaminationproceeding, shall not be recognized in any Office proceeding unless a certificateof correction under andSection; 1.323 is requested by the patent owner whichmeets the terms of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. These paragraphsspecify the procedures that a patent owner must follow to ensure both thata replacement or supplemental deposit will be recognized in any Officeproceeding and that a certificate of correction under this section containing``up to date'' information about a deposited biological material will begranted. The term ``recognized in any Office proceeding'' as used in thissection includes the proceeding in which a request for certificate of correctionunder this section is acted upon. Paragraph (b) describes the informationwhich must be contained in the certificate of correction, whereas paragraph(c) describes when the request must be made and the information which mustbe provided in the request to make the correction. The rules require, <T3>inter alia</T3>, that replacement or supplement of a deposit be madediligently, followed by prompt request thereafter for a certificate ofcorrection, as conditions precedent to being recognized in any Office proceeding.Thus, for example, if a patent owner learns early during the term of thepatent that the depository cannot furnish samples of a deposit describedin the patent and the patent owner fails to both diligently make a replacementdeposit and promptly thereafter request a certificate of correction underthese rules, a replacement deposit made years later when the patent becomesthe subject of a reissue application or reexamination proceeding will notbe recognized by the Office nor will any request for certificate of correctionin connection with that deposit be granted.Where a proper request for certificate of correction is made and has beengranted, any correction made to the original patent will be automaticallyincorporated into any reissued or reexamined patent unless changes aremade during examination of the reissue application or reexamination proceeding.Paragraph (d) of andSection; 1.805 sets forth the Office position that thefailure to make a replacement deposit or, in the case of a patent, diligentlymake a replacement deposit and promptly thereafter request a certificateof correction which meets the terms of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section,after notification that samples of an earlier deposit cannot be furnished,shall cause the application or patent involved to be treated in any Officeproceeding as if no deposit were made.Paragraph (e) thereof indicates that the Office will apply a rebuttablepresumption of an identity between the replacement deposit and an originaldeposit where a patent making reference to the deposit is relied on duringany Office proceeding. This means that where a replacement deposit is permittedand made, the examiner will assume that the same material as describedin the patent is accessible from the identified depository unless evidenceto the contrary comes to the attention of the Office.An applicant for patent may make a replacement or supplemental depositduring the pendency of the application for any reason. The provisions ofparagraph (f) of andSection; 1.805 recognize that since an original depositmay be made during the pendency of the application subject to the conditionsof andSection; 1.809, a replacement or supplemental deposit logically cannotbe held to any higher standard or any further requirements. Likewise, theprovisions of paragraph (g) indicate that neither a replacement nor a supplementaldeposit need be made where, at the point in time when replacement or supplementwould otherwise be necessary, access to the necessary biological materialwas otherwise available. For example, a replacement or supplemental depositwould not be required under the circumstances where access to the necessarybiological material was established through commercial suppliers.The provisions of paragraph (h) of andSection; 1.805 indicate that a replacementdeposit is not required even though the depository cannot furnish samples,under certain conditions, to those requesting a sample outside of the jurisdictionwhere the depository is located. The conditions are specified in this paragraphas being limited to national security, health or environmental safety reasons.Finally, paragraph (i) of this section indicates that the Office will notrecognize in any Office proceeding a replacement deposit made by the patentowner where the depository could furnish samples of the deposit being replaced.The best evidence of what was originally deposited should not be lost throughdestruction or replacement if made in association with an existing patent.A supplemental deposit may be accepted in an Office proceeding, however,depending on the circumstances in each case.Term of Deposit (Section 1.806)The term of deposit must satisfy the requirements of the Budapest Treatywhich sets a term of at least 30 years from the date of deposit and atleast five (5) years after the most recent request for the furnishing ofa sample of the deposit was received by the depository. In the event thatthe 30-year term covers the 17-year term of the patent plus six (6) yearsto include the Statute of Limitations, no further requirement is necessary.The mere possibility of patent term extension or extended litigation involvingthe patent should not be considered in this analysis.In the event that the 30-year term of deposit measured from the date ofdeposit would necessarily terminate within the period of enforceabilityof the patent (normally the 17-year term plus six (6) years), samples mustbe stored under agreements that would make them available beyond the enforceablelife of the patent for which the deposit was made. No requirement shouldbe made as to any particular period of time beyond the enforceable lifeof the patent. The purpose of the requirement is to insure that a depositedbiological material necessary for the practice of a patented inventionwould be available to the public after expiration of the patent for whichthe deposit was made. The term of the deposit must comply with the requirementsof each sentence of andSection; 1.806 whether or not the deposit is madeunder the Budapest Treaty. A specific statement that the deposit complieswith the second sentence of this section is required only where the 30-yearterm would terminate within the enforceable life of the patent.Viability of Deposits (Section 1.807)This section requires that the deposit of biological material that is capableof self-replication either directly or indirectly must be viable at thetime of deposit and during the term of deposit. This requirement for viabilityis essentially a requirement that the deposited material is capable ofreproduction. For the purpose of making a deposit under these rules, thereis no requirement that evidence be provided that the deposited materialis capable or has the ability to perform any function described in thepatent application. However, as with any other issue of description orenablement, if the examiner has evidence or reason to question the objectivestatements made in the patent application, applicants may be required todemonstrate that the deposited biological material will perform in themanner described.Under the Budapest Treaty, there is a requirement that the deposit be testedfor viability before it is accepted. Thus, a mere statement by applicant,an authorized representative of applicant or the assignee that the deposithas been accepted under the Budapest Treaty would satisfy andSection; 1.807.For each deposit which is not made under the Budapest Treaty, a viabilitystatement must be filed in the patent application and contain the informationlisted in paragraph (b) of this section. Under paragraph (c), the examinerwill accept the conclusion set forth in a viability statement which isissued by a depository recognized under andSection; 1.803(a). If the viabilitytest indicates that the deposit is not viable upon receipt, or the examinercannot for scientific or other valid reasons accept the statement of viabilityreceived from the applicant, the examiner shall so notify the applicantstating the reasons for not accepting the statement and proceed with theexamination process as if no deposit had been made.Furnishing of Samples (Section 1.808)This section requires that the deposit of biological material be made undertwo (2) conditions:(1) Access to the deposit will be available during pendency of the patentapplication making reference to the deposit to one determined by the Commissionerto be entitled thereto under andSection; 1.14 and 35 U.S.C. 122, and(2) With one exception, that all restrictions imposed by the depositoron the availability to the public of the deposited biological materialwill be irrevocably removed upon the granting of the patent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The one exception that is permitted is specified in paragraph (b)of this section which permits the depositor to contract with the depositoryto require that samples of a deposited biological material shall be furnishedonly if a request for a sample, during the term of the patent meets anyone or all of the three conditions specified in this paragraph. These conditionsare:(1) The request is in writing or other tangible form and dated; and/or(2) The request contains the name and address of the requesting party andthe accession number of the deposit; and/or(3) The request is communicated in writing by the depository to the depositoralong with the date on which the sample was furnished and the name andaddress of the party to whom the sample was furnished.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">It should be noted that this exception to the general rule that allrestrictions will be removed must be strictly followed and that no variationsof this explicit exception will be accepted as meeting the conditions ofthis section. This exception is consistent with the provisions in the BudapestTreaty and its implementing regulations (Rule 11.4).Since the mere description of a deposit or identity of a deposit in a patentspecification is not necessarily an indication that a requirement for depositwas made or that a deposit which complies with these rules has been made,accessibility to a deposited material referenced in a patent may dependon the satisfaction of conditions not apparent on the face of the patent.For these reasons, and upon request made to the Patent and Trademark Office,the Office will certify whether a deposit has been stated to have beenmade under conditions which would make it available to the public as ofthe issue date of the patent grant provided the request is made to theDirector of Patent Examining Group 180, and contains the following information:(1) The name and address of the depository(2) The accession number given to the deposit (3) The patent number and issue date of the patent referring to the depositand(4) The name and address of the requesting party.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For those deposits made pursuant to the Budapest Treaty, the WorldIntellectual Property Organization provides a form (Form BP-12) for requestinga certification of the availability of samples of deposited microorganismspursuant to Rule 11.3(a) of the regulations under the Budapest Treaty.Copies of this form are available from the Director of Patent ExaminingGroup 180.Examination Procedures (Section 1.809)This section sets forth procedures that will be used by the examiner toaddress a deposit issue. Deposit issues may arise in the examination ofclaims in applications for patent and for reissue of a patent, and in theexamination of new or amended claims in a reexamination proceeding. Theburden is initially on the Office to establish that access to a biologicalmaterial is necessary for the satisfaction of the statutory requirementsfor patentability under 35 U.S.C. 112. Once the Office has met this burden,the burden shifts to the applicant or patent owner to demonstrate thataccess to such biological material either is not necessary or is alreadyavailable, or that a deposit of such material is being or will be made,replaced or supplemented in accordance with these regulations.Under paragraph (a) of this section, once the examiner has determined thataccess to a biological material is necessary, and that access is not presentlyavailable in accordance with these regulations, the examiner should makean appropriate rejection under 35 U.S. 112.The applicant or patent owner may respond, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)of this section, to a rejection made under paragraph (a) thereof by arguingwhy a deposit is not needed under the circumstances and/or why a depositactually made should be acceptable. Other prescribed responses which areavailable to such a rejection depend upon whether the rejection is madein an application for patent, on the one hand, or in a proceeding involvinga patent, i.e., an application for reissue patent or reexamination proceeding,on the other hand.In an application for patent, applicant may respond, pursuant to paragraph(b)(1) of this section, by either making an acceptable original, replacementor supplemental deposit in accordance with these regulations, or assuringthe Office in writing that an acceptable deposit will be made on or beforethe date of payment of the issue fee. In a proceeding involving a patent,the patent owner may respond, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section,by requesting a certificate of correction of the patent which meets theterms of paragraphs (b) and (c) of andSection; 1.805. In all cases, any otherresponse shall be considered non-responsive. The rejection will be repeatedand made final until the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this sectionare satisfied or the examiner is convinced that a deposit is not requiredfor the claimed subject matter.As set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, in the event that an applicationfor patent is otherwise in condition for allowance except for a neededdeposit and the Office has received a written assurance that an acceptabledeposit will be made, the Office will mail to the applicant a requirementthat the needed deposit be made within three (3) months together with theNotice of Allowance and Issue Fee Due. Although the period for paying theissue fee cannot be extended under the provisions of andSection; 1.136, theperiod for satisfying the requirement to make an acceptable deposit maybe extended under the provisions of that section. Failure to make the neededdeposit in accordance with this requirement may be considered a failureto prosecute the application under 35 U.S.C. 133 and result in abandonmentof the application.The type of written assurance which will be considered acceptable by theOffice that an acceptable deposit will be made within the required timemust include sufficient information to conclude that there is no outstandingissue with regard to the deposit of an appropriate biological materialunder conditions which satisfy these rules.In a proceeding involving a patent, it may not be possible to request acertificate of correction of the patent which meets the terms of paragraphs(b) and (c) of andSection; 1.805. For example, if the patent owner is onnotice that samples of an original deposit can no longer be furnished bythe depository, failure to diligently make a replacement deposit will precludegrant of a certificate of correction. A replacement deposit subsequentlymade will not be recognized by the Office nor will a request for certificateof correction, even if made promptly thereafter, be granted. It would alsonot be possible to request a certificate of correction of the patent whichmeets the terms of paragraphs (b) and (c) of andSection; 1.805 where no originaldeposit was made before or during the pendency of the application whichmatured into the patent.A patent defective because of lack of a necessary deposit is necessarilyfatally defective for failure to comply with the first paragraph of 35U.S.C. 112. Reissue is not available in such cases. See <T3>In re Hay,</T3> 534 F.2d 917, 189 USPQ 790 (CCPA 1976). Whether reissueis available where a biological material necessary for compliance with35 U.S.C. 112 was known and readily available at the time of issuance ofthe patent and subsequently ceased to be readily available is problematic.Nevertheless, the rules do not provide for post-issue original deposits.Where an applicant for patent has any doubt whether access to a biologicalmaterial specifically identified in the specification is necessary to satisfy35 U.S.C. 112 or whether such a material, while presently freely available,may become unavailable in the future, the applicant would be well-advisedto make a deposit thereof before any patent issues. Similarly, where apatent owner has any doubt whether a deposit referred to in the specificationis of a biological material necessary to satisfy 35 U.S.C. 112 and, ifthe material is necessary, whether it is otherwise known and readily available,the patent owner would be well-advised to follow the procedures set forthin paragraphs (b) and (c) of andSection; 1.805 after receiving the noticespecified in those paragraphs.Paragraph (d) of this section sets forth the requirements for the contentof the specification with respect to a deposited biological material. Specifically,the specification shall contain the accession number for the deposit, thedate of the deposit, the name and address of the depository, and a descriptionof the deposited biological material sufficient to specifically identifyit and to permit examination. The description must be sufficient to permitverification that the deposited biological material is in fact that disclosed.Once the patent issues, the description must be sufficient to aid in theresolution of questions of infringement. As a general rule, the more informationthat is provided about a particular deposited biological material, thebetter the examiner will be able to compare the identity and characteristicsof the deposited biological material with the prior art.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Considerations</ITAG>The rules are in conformity with the requirements of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (Pub. L. 96-354), Executive Orders 12291 and 12612 and the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>The General Counsel has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, SmallBusiness Administration, that this rule change is not expected to havea significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of smallentites (Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354). The deposit practicewill not impose extra work on patent applicants (whether small or largebusinesses or individuals).The Patent and Trademark Office has determined that this rule change isnot a major rule under Executive Order 12291. The annual effect on theeconomy will be less than $100 million. There will be no major increasesin costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, Stateor local government agencies, or geographic regions. There will be no adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.The Patent and Trademark Office has also determined that this notice hasno Federalism implications affecting the relationship between the NationalGovernment and the States as outlined in Executive Order 12612.These rules contain a collection of information requirement subject tothe Paperwork Reduction Act which has been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget under Control No. 0651-0022. Public reporting burden for thiscollection of information is estimated to average one hour per response,including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing datasources, gathering and maintaining the data needed to make a deposit orrequest a sample, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.It is further estimated that a respondent depository would spend aboutfive hours collecting and submitting the necessary information to be recognizedas a suitable depository by the Office. Send comments regarding this burdenestimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, includingsuggestions for reducing this burden, to the Office of Management and Organization,Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, DC 20231, and to the Office ofInformation and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington,DC 20503 (Paperwork Reduction Project 0651-0022). No comments regardingthis burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information,including suggestions for reducing this burden, were received in responseto the notice of proposed rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 37 CFR Part 1</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Courts, Freedom of information,Inventions and patents, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Smallbusiness.For the reason as set out in the preamble, 37 CFR part 1 is amended asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1_RULES OF PRACTICE IN PATENT CASES</ITAG>1.
