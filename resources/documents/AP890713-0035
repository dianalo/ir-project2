The committee, after giving tentative approval to a $5.3 billionrevenue increase, is putting finishing touches on the package. Aidessay the subject of capital gains likely will be raised again beforethe final vote, as will an attempt to defer a new tax that financescatastrophic health insurance.   The revenue-increase plan, a mishmash of mostly technical changesaffecting corporations, was approved by voice vote in a closed-doorsession Wednesday after the committee, by a 22-11 margin, rejectedBush's call for a capital gains cut.   Another voice vote eliminated a proposed one-year extension ofthe 3 percent tax on telephone service, which is due to expire Dec.31, 1990.   Still left in the bill are increases in taxes on snuff andchewing and pipe tobacco; imposition of income tax withholding onsome farm workers who now are exempt; a one-year extension of the 8percent airline ticket tax and the 5 percent levy on air freight,and imposing Social Security taxes on some deferred compensation.   Tentatively approved but still subject to change are the biggestrevenue-raisers in the bill: repeal of special dividend and interestdeductions benefiting lenders and employers for investments inemployee stock-ownership plans.   Those changes would bring in more than $1.6 billion of the $5.3billion of revenue increases that the committee is under orders toraise for deficit reduction in the budget year that begins Oct. 1.   The committee attached a provision wiping out most of thedisputed parts of a 1986 law, known as Section 89, that requiresemployers to use complex tests to prove their employee health-careplans are not weighted in favor of higher-paid workers.   Under the committee's action, no Section 89 provisions would beenforced before Jan. 1. After that date, any employer-paid healthplan would be acceptable if made available to 90 percent ofemployees and the employer paid at least half the premium.   The health premium charged a worker earning under $20,000 a yearcould not exceed $1,000 for a policy covering only the employee and$2,000 for a policy covering a family.   Small businesses would get an additional break. The healthinsurance provided by an employer with fewer than 20 workers wouldpass federal muster as long as the company gave coverage to allworkers and contributed the same premium for all.   Section 89 was enacted to encourage expansion of health coverageto more workers. The committee proposal, similar to changes approvedby the Senate, does not repeal anti-discrimination requirements;they simply free employers from complex tests to prove their plansare fair.   Most of the votes against the cut in capital gains taxes, whichapply to profits from the sale of stock and other assets, were castby Democrats. They are wary of voting a capital gains cut becausealmost all the benefits go to upper-income people.   However, aides working for members of both parties say there is achance Democrats might change their minds if Bush offers to supportother tax changes that they favor.   The administration proposed the capital gains tax cut as a way toraise revenue. Although there is general agreement that such areduction would boost revenues during the first year, by encouraginginvestors to sell some long-held assets, congressional economistsinsist a cut would lose money later.</TEXT></DOC>
