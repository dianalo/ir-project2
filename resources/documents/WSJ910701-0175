Glavin,president and chief executive officer, said.   Mr. Glavin said the company would conduct initial clinicaltrials of its HIV vaccine on 10 to 15 uninfected patients inCalifornia. Among the patients: polio pioneer and ImmuneResponse founder Jonas Salk.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We don't say this vaccine will eliminate the HIVinfection. But it does give you something to fight theinfection,&quot; Mr. Glavin said.&quot;We may be able to preventsomeone who is HIV-infected from progressing into gettingAIDS conditions.&quot;   Despite advances in the testing of its vaccine, ImmuneResponse expects to report a second-quarter net loss of$900,000, or six cents a share, largely because the companyis in the research and development stage of its products, Mr.Glavin said.   A year earlier, the company reported net income of$232,759, or two cents a share. Mr. Glavin says the firmexpects to report revenue for the quarter just ended of morethan $1 million, compared with $1,041,145 a year earlier.   Mr. Glavin said that the loss for Immune Response, whichis conducting research and development for several vaccinesbut has no products on the market, was expected. Since lastyear, the company has been in a joint agreement withRhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. to develop, make and market thecompany's HIV Immunotherapeutic vaccine, which is undergoinghuman clinical trials in patients infected with the virus.Mr. Glavin said the partners alternate paying for developmentcosts, thus Immune Response's loss for the quarter this yearand net income in the previous second quarter.   Various other companies are in different stages of testingtheir own acquired immune deficiency syndrome vaccines. TheImmune Response vaccine, the company's first product underdevelopment, is based on a scientific approach firstsuggested by Dr. Salk. He proposed using whole butinactivated AIDS viruses to inoculate people alreadyinfected. Where other researchers use genetically engineeredor synthetic virus proteins, Dr. Salk has chosen to use livevirus killed with gamma radiation.   Some scientists have said they believe such viruses to beunsafe in humans, but Immune Response said it safelycompleted testing of the vaccine on humans infected with theAIDS virus. The uninfected patients to be inoculated thisyear will be tested for changes in their immune responsesystem. If such a response registers, the company will testthe vaccine in a larger population of patients, perhaps inAfrica, where there is rapid growth in the AIDS virus.   To date, Immune Response's primary research has been onusing the vaccine in patients who are already HIV infected.In an initial study of these, the safety of the vaccine wasconfirmed, Mr. Glavin said. In addition, after more than ayear of follow-up, 10 of the 19 showed a gain in their levelsof immune cells, with a substantial improvement in theirT-cell count, the white blood cells that are normallydepleted over time by AIDS. The number responding to skintests of their immune reactivity jumped to 63% from 20%.   The study began in 1987, and Mr. Glavin said that of the19 HIV-infected patients, 15 have stabilized and remain freeof the AIDS virus, three have either developed AIDS or seentheir condition worsen, and one has died of the disease. &quot;Thenumbers are staggeringly in our favor,&quot; Mr. Glavin said.&quot;This is remarkable vis-a-vis the results anyone else isgetting.&quot;   The company is now in the third phase of testing thevaccine for efficacy in infected patients and expects to haveresults in September 1992. Mr. Glavin said he believes itwill be the first therapeutic vaccine to come up for Food andDrug Administration approval, probably in 1993.   In addition, the company is working on vaccines to treatcertain autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,multiple sclerosis and Type I diabetes. It plans to beginhuman clinical trials this year on patients with rheumatoidarthritis and a year after that on those with multiplesclerosis and Type I diabetes. Mr. Glavin said that althoughothers are working on similar vaccines, he believes ImmuneResponse will be the first to apply for FDA approval. He saidthe company is also beginning work on a vaccine for tumortherapy.   For the six months, Mr. Glavin said, the company expectsto report a loss of almost $3 million, or about 24 cents ashare, compared with net of $89,868, or one cent a share.Immune Response expects revenue of about $2 million, comparedwith $2,302,123 last year.   The company, which recently completed a secondaryoffering, has about $54 million cash on hand, Mr. Glavinsaid, and expects to spend about $8 million this year onresearch and development.</TEXT></DOC>
