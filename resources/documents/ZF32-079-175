 Many of PrePrint's users found the program unsuitable for highproductivity.andM;In response to the complaints, Aldus recently released PrePrint 1.5, a majorenhancement over the first version.andP;  Not only has the new version made itpossible, even sensible, to separate color pages created in PageMaker 4.01,it is also capable of separating Adobe Illustrator 3.0 and Aldus FreeHand 3.0files as well.andP;  While not without its flaws, this new version of PrePrintshould help re-establish PageMaker as a credible source for color publishing.andM;Out with the old.andP;  The biggest problem with the old version was theimpossibility of printing precise page ranges or plates.andP;  If you had, forexample, a document with five pages, PrePrint would pop out all the magentaplates, followed by all the cyan plates and so on.andP;  If you had to change filmin the middle of a job or if a PostScript error stopped the job, you werelikely to end up with out-of-register plates and a pile of wasted film.andP;  Youcouldn't, for example, print just a cyan plate of the third page to replace ascratched piece of film.andP;  As a result, operators had to laboriously breakeach document into single pages or risk enormous film waste andinconvenience.andP;  The new version of PrePrint allows for complete flexibilityin page and plate selection.andM;PrePrint's ability to include DCS files makes life easier for those who wantto do retouching and separation in such programs as Photoshop or Letraset'sColorStudio, and simply pass the separated files along to PageMaker.andP;  Withnew capabilities for editing images in CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) inboth those programs, preseparated DCS files will take on even moreimportance.andM;The old version of PrePrint also ignored the imagesetter calibration settingsand applied its own Printer Description Extension (PDX) imagesettercorrections.andP;  As a result, most calibration adjustments were doubled, in manycases throwing density settings way off.andP;  In PrePrint 1.5, the calibration ofthe imagesetter can be set to override the PDX calibrations.andM;The older version of PrePrint delivered decent separations, but like all newseparation programs it had weaknesses, especially in adjusting saturationlevels in certain colors.andP;  Version 1.5 has improved its color model and seemsto have gotten a few of the kinks out of the color-translation tables.andM;In with the new.andP;  Aside from correcting some of the worst features of theearlier version, PrePrint 1.5's capacities have been significantly extended.andO;PrePrint now can handle separated TIFF files in CMYK form, a likely secondarystandard after the DCS format.andP;  Even better, since few applications currentlyhandle these files now, you can substitute a low-resolution RGB (red, green,blue) version of the TIFF file in an application such as FreeHand and thenautomatically substitute the high-resolution version of the file at printtime, with cropping and rotation information in place.andM;For users wishing to produce pages for several different formats, PrePrintnow allows you to globally reset the dot-gain parameters for the wholedocument.andP;  This is extremely helpful for producing an ad that will run onboth magazine stock and newsprint.andM;The Print command offers a detailed description of exactly what it is you aregoing to print, including colors, dimensions, all crop marks, dot gain andother printing options.andP;  This feature makes it easy to fix last-minutemistakes.andM;The most important new feature in PrePrint 1.5 is the enhanced linking.andP;  Filelinking was present in the earlier version, but it has been polished andextended.andP;  You can link any graphic file to the main separation file at anytime.andP;  This means that it is easy to make changes or corrections to a graphicfile and substitute it without having to open up PageMaker and re-save themaster file.andM;Still rough in places.andP;  Some features that users objected to in the firstversion have not been fixed.andP;  You still have to save the main files inPostScript format before processing them; you cannot print separationsdirectly from PageMaker.andP;  This has its advantages in linking, but many userswant to print from the application rather than go through an extra step.andM;Moreover, PrePrint is a fairly costly program for a PageMaker designer tobuy, and many are likely to leave that burden to the service bureau operator.andO;As a result, few clients will create low-resolution sample separations inadvance (as many XPress users do), and the result will be a larger number ofmisconceived separations.andP;  We hope that Aldus will bundle at least a limitedversion of PrePrint with PageMaker in the future, perhaps in a version thatworks only with 300-dpi printers.andM;Who is it for?andP;  The color-correction controls (commands such as Sharpen,Enhance Midtones, Contrast and Brighten) are simplified for novice users.andO;This command format may be a big help to non-technical users who want tostart making simple adjustments, but for sophisticated users, a clearerunderstanding of what is going on underneath is more valuable.andP;  For example,how much sharpening does the Sharpening command actually do -- and is thisthe same as the unsharp masking feature in other applications?andP;  We expectthat even novice users will want to become experts eventually.andM;Conclusions.andP;  PrePrint 1.5 is a big improvement over its predecessor.andP;  Thecrippling problems have been fixed and several important new features havebeen added.andP;  The product is finally a reasonable alternative for those whoprefer to create color pages with PageMaker.andM;On the other hand, PrePrint still has a long way to go.andP;  Aldus hasn't decidedwhether this is a program for users or service bureaus, a production tool forprinting, or a color-correction tool.andM;It's also unclear whether PrePrint is designed for novices or experts.andO;Perhaps the modest choice of version number (instead of 2.0) means Aldus hasleft PrePrint some more room to grow.andM;Aldus Corp. is at 411 First Ave., Seattle, Wash.andP;  98104.andP;  Phone (206)622-5500; fax (206) 343-3360.andM;While it is still early, the reaction from service bureaus using AldusPrePrint 1.5 ranges from enthusiasm to moderate respect.andP;  Most find thequality of the separations at least acceptable, and all are pleased by theprogram's improved ease of use and features.andM;Daniel Clark, at Raging Fingers in Los Angeles is overjoyed about thechanges.andP;  &quot;It's like night and day,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We are now getting bright,fully saturated colors without errors.&quot; Clark found that the program makesAldus FreeHand especially viable for serious color work that includesimported photographic images.andM;For Van Tanner of Desktop Publishing Services Inc. in Greensboro, N.C., thekey feature is the ability to run longer jobs.andP;  &quot;We can do a 15-page colorPageMaker job in one run, which we would have never dared to do with theolder version,&quot; he said.andM;Steve Werner of Central Graphics in San Diego found that the new program putsout decent separations and is reliable on routine jobs.andP;  He warned againstgetting involved with extremely complex pages, however, especially those withDCS (Desktop Color Separation) files.andP;  Others we talked to said the programseemed slow at processing DCS files and less than 100 percent reliable onvery large DCS images.andP;  Werner noted that the separated files have no problemwith the patented High Quality Screening (HQS) on the company's Linotype 330.andM;Ed Bell of LaserWriting in Denver, said he is still &quot;not in love with theinterface.&quot; Though with some experience and experimentation, he conceededthat it is possible to get good color output from the package.andP;  -- By SteveHannafordandM;PrePrint 1.5andM;Aldus Corp.andM;PrePrint 1.5 finally makes PageMaker a platform for serious color publishingand gives very good separation capabilities to PageMaker, Illustrator andFreeHand.andP;  Aldus responded to complaints from the service bureau industry andmade PrePrint into a usable product.andP;  But the program still hasn't quiteestablished for whom and what it is intended, and the price tag is guaranteedto scare away all but imagesetter owners.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
