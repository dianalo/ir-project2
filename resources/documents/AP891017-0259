Wall Street's near-record Friday the 13th plunge and subsequentgyrations in stock markets worldwide was sparked by the failure ofa management-employee group to get financing for its planned $6.75billion buyout of United Airlines.   Nervousness about further market volatility might make it harderfor European bidders to raise funds for debt-financed deals.Would-be buyers also are likely to scrutinize the profitability andbreakup value of their targets much more closely, the experts said.   Market gyrations also could exacerbate anti-buyout, anti-junkbond sentiment in Europe, where there is widespread ambivalenceabout the import of these American takeover techniques.   ``Human nature being what it is, when there a fright in themarket people immediately begin to question whether they ought tobe doing what they're doing,'' said Bruce Classon, managingdirector of corporate finance at Bankers Trust Co. in London.   ``European banks and even American banks will be more cautiousthan in the past,'' said Roger Brooke, chief executive of CandoverInvestments, a London-based buyout firm.   Big, highly leveraged deals are raising controversy.Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith's $21 billionall-securities bid for the British conglomerate BAT Industries PLChas prompted a storm of protests in Britain.   In a leveraged buyout, or LBO, a bidder borrows funds to takeover a company, then uses that company's profits or sells itsassets to pay off the debt.   Such deals frequently are financed with the high-yield,high-risk debt securities called junk bonds. Junk bonds are sonamed because of their low credit ratings, which means they have aconsidered to have greater default risk than higher-rated bonds.   A slowdown in such deals could further deflate the London stockmarket, which recently has gotten some support from takeoverspeculation.   Cheaper share prices resulting from the market downturn couldspur cash buyout bids, although not to the extent seen after theOctober 1987 stock market crash, experts said.   ``Investors and bankers are looking at economic prospects morecautiously around the world,'' said Guy Dawson, head of corporatefinance at Morgan Grenfell Group PLC.   ``You will see a slowdown in the market,'' Dawson said. ``Eitheryou will see fewer buyouts or they will be done at lower prices.''   But he added, ``I don't think it spells the end of the LBOmarket at all.''   Bidders turned their attention to London and the rest of Europeas a potential LBO market because competition among buyout housesin the United States has reduced yields of such deals there.   But higher interest rates in Europe have been making it moreexpensive to finance buyouts. In Britain, Europe's biggest takeovermarket, interest rates are 15 percent, an eight-year high, partlydue to government attempts to curb inflation.   Also working against LBOs are concerns about corporateprofitability in a climate of slowing economic growth and higherinflation, particularly in Britain.   Critics say companies with heavy debts can go bust when interestrates rise and also have less leeway to spend money on research anddevelopment.   Europeans also are biased against buyouts because they fear theywill cause job losses, worsening the Continent's relatively highunemployment.   Matthias Graeper, a consultant in the Hamburg office of theBritish buyout firm Schroder Ventures Manager Ltd., said: ``Thereare some bad feelings about junk bonds and the purchase prices ofsome companies in the United States but I think we can avoid themistakes in Germany.''</TEXT></DOC>
