From this group a sample of 222 patients wasanalyzed. They included 111 patients with colonic polyps and 111 withcancer. These cases were carefully examined, in terms of age, frequencyof this pathology according to sex, symptom-illness rate, and the radiologicaldata were compared with the endoscopic and histological findings. Thedata were processed using a computerized program. A critical correlationof the data obtained revealed that: 1) The surest symptom of colon carcinomais blood in faeces with or without changes in defaecation frequency.Nor should isolated bowel disorders be ignored (''irritated'' colon dueto organic injuries). 2) The diagnostic accuracy of double contrast enemais very close to that of endoscopy, provided that intestinal cleaningis adequate (this in fact is an important aspect of the examination).3) The mean age of the patients in this group is high and cancer is morecommon than polyps. This seems to be due to the back of a complete diagnosticsequence, in which radiology has a specific and important role.</TEXT></DOC>
