Mario Biaggi, with 48 candidatesbeing excused and 58 others asked to return.   Last week, 94 potential jurors were excused for hardshipreasons, leaving 106 who had filled out a 63-item questionnaireabout their feelings and who they might know involved in the case.   On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Constance Baker Motleyexcused 48 candidates based upon their answers while 58 were askedto return Tuesday, either to be requestioned or to appear for thefirst time.   The jurors will have to decide the fate of Biaggi, his eldestson, former Bronx Borough President Stanley Simon and fourco-defendants, who are accused of turning the Wedtech Corp. into a``vehicle for making illegal payments to public officials.''   The seven are charged with participating in a racketeeringenterprise that allegedly looted millions of dollars in stock andcash from Wedtech, a Bronx defense contractor now in bankruptcyproceedings.   All are charged with racketeering and conspiracy, each carryinga maximum 20-year penalty upon conviction. Biaggi also is accusedof extortion, bribe-receiving, wire fraud, perjury and filing falsetax returns, and the other defendants also face various othercharges.   Wedtech was a small, Bronx machine shop that grew into amultimillion- dollar-a-year defense contractor. It rose through aSmall Business Administration program that allowed minority-ownedfirms to obtain government contracts without competitive bidding.   A number of federal, state and local inquiries are looking intoallegations of bribery, influence peddling and other wrongdoing.   Asked about one of his responses to the questionnaire, apotential juror, Joseph C. Siragusi, told Mrs. Motley he hadproblems with the concept of programs set up especially to helpminorities and women.   When Mrs. Motley further explained the concept to him, Siragusisaid: ``Under that circumstance, I wouldn't consider it unfair.''   When there were no objections from defense and governmentattorneys, Mrs. Motley ruled there was no reason to excuseSiragusi. He will be reinterviewed Tuesday.   Raymond Joseph Sullivan, another jury candidate from the Bronx,was asked if he had stated on the questionnaire that he opposedprograms helping minorities.   ``Sure did,'' Sullivan said. ``I have four children. I wouldn'twant to see them denied a job.''   Sullivan was asked to return when court resumes at 9:30 a.m.Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
