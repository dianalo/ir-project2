Dukakis' opposition to the mobile MX and Midgetman missiles lefthim on the defensive, while Bush was claiming the INF treaty withthe Soviets, the ceasefire in the Persian Gulf and the Sovietwithdrawal from Afghanistan as evidence that the Reagan militarybuild-up was yielding dividends.   When Dukakis donned a helmet and went for a ride in an M-1 tank,the Republican used the film footage for ads ridiculing the Democratand charging he ``opposed virtually every defense system wedeveloped.''   Dukakis took to reciting a litany of the new weapons he supports,from the Stealth bomber to the Trident II missile for submarines toadvanced cruise missiles, as well as anti-tank and otherconventional weaponry.   While Bush was quick to pounce on Dukakis' opposition to the MXand Midgetman, he was slower to admit that he could not afford both,if elected.   ``My secretary of defense is going to have a very difficultdecision in which system to go forward with,'' the Republican said.   There will be plenty of difficult decisions at the Pentagon forthe next president. Military and congressional analysts agree thePentagon budget would have to be raised by at least $250 billionover the next five years to pay for all the new weapons in thePentagon pipeline.   Both Dukakis and Bush have essentially ruled out such bigincreases. Bush has said the military would be subject to his``flexible freeze'' on all spending except Social Security. Dukakisfavors ``stable'' defense budgets.   ``It's been a dirty little secret of the Reagan administrationthat for the whole second term the defense budget has undergone realdeclines,'' said Kenneth Adelman, Reagan's former director of theArms Control and Disarmament Agency.   After doubling in his first four years, the Pentagon budget hasfallen 10 percent in real dollars since 1985. It is still 53 percenthigher than before the Carter-Reagan build-up.   Lawrence Korb, a former Reagan assistant secretary of defense,said: ``Right now in defense you have a $400 billion program and a$300 billion budget. Whoever gets in there is going to have to getthat program down. ... Something will have to go.''   As he came under fire from Bush, Dukakis tempered his criticismof the Midgetman, a single-warhead weapon favored by such Democratsas Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia. Dukakis said current Midgetmanproposals are too expensive, but he would work with Congress ``tofind a sensible, affordable way'' to modernize land-based U.S.missiles.   Bush charged his opponent was ``viscerally uncomfortable withanything related to the nuclear arsenal.'' He cited Dukakis' refusalto allow construction in Massachusetts of a bakup radio network toallow military communications during a nuclear war.   Dukakis also favors scrapping two planned supercarrier taskforces that cost $18 billion each.   On the Strategic Defense Initiative, Dukakis called for scalingback the research budget from $4 billion to $1 billion and said:``We'll continue research on strategic defenses, but we're not goingto waste hundreds of billions of dollars on a system our bestscientists say won't work, at a time when we're shortchanging ourtroops in the field and mortgaging our future.''   But Bush promised to develop and deploy SDI ``as fast aspossible'' so that the United States would not be defenselessagainst ballistic missiles. Bush questioned why Dukakis would spend``a dime'' on SDI if he considered it a fraud.   Dukakis contended that what the American military really needs isa ``conventional defense initiative'' to beef up front-line forcesin Europe.   Bush said, ``I believe that the administration's approach inrebuilding America's defenses is fundamentally correct.''   But the big military build-up, which actually started in thefinal years of the Carter administration, already is over.   Building up conventional strength, as Dukakis promises, isn'tcheap.   Adelman, now vice president of the Institute for ContemporaryStudies, said: ``Dukakis cannot save any money like he talks aboutby cutting down the strategic forces and pouring those funds intoconventional forces. There's not going to be that much to pour in.Strategic forces account for at the most 12 percent of the U.S.defense budget. Eighty-eight percent is conventional.''   Military analyst Joshua M. Epstein said it is Bush's figures thatdon't add up.   ``Bush is talking about trying to drive eight lanes of trafficthrough a three-lane tunnel as far as the Pentagon budget isconcerned. He has just not realistically faced up to the budgetconstraints that will be imposed by Congress,'' said Epstein, aBrookings senior fellow.   ``If you're not prepared to cut some of these glamor programsthen things like readiness and training and personnel andmaintenance and conventional forces are going to take a beating,''he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Release Anytime</NOTE></DOC>
