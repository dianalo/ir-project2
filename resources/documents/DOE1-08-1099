If we look at convergencestability and computing time alone, some of the results can be summarizedas follows. In cases where a wide-boiling mixture is processed and theflow rates of product streams are variable during the iterations, theproblem is the absorption type; and when at least one of these two featuresis not found, the problem is the distillation type. Methods where liquidmole fractions or component liquid flow rates are not included in theindependent variables are inapplicable to nonideal mixtures. The Block-Hegnermethod presents most excellent results in distillation type problems,but the approximate treatments in linearization used in the other methodslimit their usefulness to an extent larger than we can expect from theoriginal reports. The Naphtali-Sandholm method is most appropriate toabsorption type problems. Each method has its own advantages and affirmativestatements should not be given, but the present paper reports other informationthat is useful in determining which method is most effective in a specificsituation.</TEXT></DOC>
