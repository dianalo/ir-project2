Michael Dukakis was running away with the New York primary, Jesse Jackson's stock dropped 90% -- to a penny a share.    Sen. Albert Gore's shares weren't doing too well, either. &quot;Selling Gore for two cents,&quot; came the trader's cry. No response. The trader tried again: &quot;Selling Gore for any price.&quot;    Here in the trading pit at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, the commodity is presidential futures. And the 25 or so traders are speculating on who will become the Democratic and Republican nominees.    The market, which opened on Feb. 4, was organized by several Wharton students and professors. For a $10 investment, students initially received five shares of stock in each of 13 announced presidential candidates and two dark horses. Then, for a frenzied hour about once a week, they gathered to trade. Because of the pace of the primaries, small fortunes were lost as quickly as made.    Before the Iowa caucuses, for example, Paul Simon opened at 30 cents a share -- close on the heels of Gov. Dukakis and Richard Gephardt. Two weeks later, following the New Hampshire primary, Sen. Simon's stock plummeted to seven cents; by March, the shares were worthless. (These days, only George Bush and Gov. Dukakis are showing strength. Mr. Bush's shares go for 90 cents each.)    Although the stakes are more similar to penny-ante poker than pork bellies, the traders play their parts convincingly, shouting out bids and waving papers around. Yet some transactions are more whimsical than wise. At the most recent session, Michael Thorson, a Wharton MBA student as well as a market organizer, made this offer: &quot;I'll sell you three Jacksons for a quarter -- but it's got to be a quarter, not two dimes and a nickel.&quot;    Sometimes emotions got in the way of rational trading. Joel Friedlander, another student, figured voters would eventually notice that Gov. Dukakis was a weak candidate, so after Iowa he dumped his Dukakis shares at 35 cents each; now they're trading at 83 cents. Says Mr. Friedlander: &quot;I guess it was a mistake.&quot;    After tomorrow's Pennsylvania primary, trading will be suspended and portfolios frozen as traders prepare to leave the pit for summer vacations. The final payoff ($1 a share for each party's nominee) will be tallied after the conventions.    But to collect their cash, these traders will have to pay a commission of sorts: The market bosses won't send them a cent unless they've turned in their own envelopes, stamped and self-addressed. </TEXT></DOC>
