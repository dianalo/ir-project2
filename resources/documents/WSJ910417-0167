Companies took over other companies mainly to growbigger, not because the acquired firm was in an even vaguelyrelated business. A standard argument was that management wasa transferable skill. If you could run a steel company, whycouldn't you operate a soft-drink firm?   Some companies did all right. General Electric, which gotan early start on extreme diversity, is still a haleconglomerate. &quot;Their management skills,&quot; says an enviouscorporate executive, &quot;are unbelievable.&quot; GE doesn't like theterm &quot;conglomerate,&quot; preferring to call itself an integrated,diverse firm with shared management practices. OK, we'llaccept that.</LP><TEXT>   The term conglomerate got a bad name in the 1980s whenmany companies found management skills weren't astransferable as they thought. Unprofitable subsidiaries andaffiliates were becoming a burden for a lot of firms,particularly as interest rates soared. Markets were becomingmuch more competitive, both at home and abroad, andexecutives decided that now was the time to become lean andmean. The deconglomeration of American business was underway.   The process was pushed in a variety of ways. If a unit wasperforming poorly, the first option was to fix it. Ifmanagement decided it couldn't do that, the unit was closedor, if a buyer could be found, sold.   That last option was where Clayton andamp; Dubilier Inc., aprivate investment firm founded in 1978, began to find aniche. The company, a brochure says, &quot;focuses primarily onthe purchase of private companies and subsidiaries ordivisions of public corporations where it believes thepotential exists to materially improve, with minimum risk,the financial and operating performance of the business.&quot;   Clayton andamp; Dubilier is a leveraged buy-out firm, heavilyreliant on debt to finance its transactions. But LBOs, likeconglomerates, have been getting a bad press lately. Companyofficials stress that Clayton andamp; Dubilier arranges onlyfriendly deals, and that they usually involve more equitythan most LBO transactions. Chairman Martin Dubilier notesthat the firm manages a fund of equity capital in excess of$1 billion, provided by a variety of financial institutions,pension funds and academic endowment funds. &quot;When we use thatup,&quot; he says, &quot;I suspect we'll raise some more.&quot;   The financing, of course, has to work, but Clayton andamp;Dubilier thinks it differs from other LBO firms primarily inits heavy emphasis on operations. About half of its dozenprincipals have backgrounds primarily in business management.   Most of Clayton andamp; Dubilier's 15 acquisitions had beenunits of larger companies. It wanted managements that couldmake it on their own, but they had to be managements thatwould play the game Clayton andamp; Dubilier's way. Clayton andamp;Dubilier principals sit on the companies' boards, monitorperformance and, if things don't work out, may changemanagers.   Clayton andamp; Dubilier has always viewed itself as a partnerof the acquired firm's management, although the Clayton andamp;Dubilier partners are somewhat more equal than the others.Its latest transaction, however, pushes partnership muchfurther than ever before. For $1.5 billion it has acquiredthe laser-printer, typewriter and office-products business ofInternational Business Machines Corp.   But this was not the clean, buy-it-and-go sort oftransaction that Clayton andamp; Dubilier has usually set up. IBM,through its bankers, approached Clayton andamp; Dubilier a yearago. Clayton andamp; Dubilier liked the idea and set up a companyto continue the typewriter/printer business: LexmartInternational Inc. But there was still a long way to go.   IBM wanted to retain a 10% interest in Lexmart which,after all, produced the printers that went along with IBMcomputer systems. Clayton andamp; Dubilier wanted to go onmarketing some Lexmart products under the IBM logo, at leastfor a few years. (Some IBM typewriter users, incidentally,will be glad to hear that Clayton andamp; Dubilier has no intentionof phasing out that product, despite the declining market fortypewriters.) Before the deal was completed, there were 60agreements dealing with specific parts of the transaction.   There were other complications. IBM really didn't careabout selling printers; it sold computer systems. IBM didn'tsell computer keyboards either. The typewriter/printer unit,Mr. Dubilier says, actually had no salesmen. Over the pastyear, Clayton andamp; Dubilier has built up a sales force of 530people, some of them from IBM, some from outside.   All of this effort has helped in the downsizing of IBM.IBM indicated last month that its first-quarter earningswould be significantly below analysts' expectations. Thecompany has announced that it plans to reduce its work forceby 10,000, with about 4,000 of the decline coming in the U.S.and about 6,000 in Europe. In addition, Lexmart will drawaway about 4,200 IBM employees.   Work force reductions aren't pleasant. IBM doesn't callthem layoffs; the reducing will be handled through earlyretirements, incentive programs and attrition. If an employeereally fouls up, though, he may become the victim of a&quot;management initiated separation.&quot; All of this is expensive,but analysts estimate that the IBM gain of about $700 millionon the Lexmart deal will about match the cost of the payrollreductions.   Employees may be supporters of the partnership approach.&quot;The people at the IBM typewriter/printer unit had alwayswanted to run it themselves,&quot; Mr. Dubilier says. &quot;Now they'llhave a chance to.&quot;   ---   The typewriter-printer business recently sold byInternational Business Machines, mentioned in a recentcolumn, is now operated by a new company called LexmarkInternational, not Lexmart as the column said.
