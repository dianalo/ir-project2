Webbdisclosing his decision to resign.   Dear Mr. President:</TEXT><TEXT>   Over the past three months the Department of Defense has beenstruggling to implement a mandated $33 billion reduction of thefiscal year 1989 budget approved by you last year. The NavyDepartment was directed to absorb a significant share of thisreduction, which eventually became approximately $12 billion.   Like many others, I have serious concerns regarding the entirebudget reduction process. First, the Department of Defense has beenrequired to absorb cuts at a ratio almost twice as great asnon-defense programs. Second, many defense reductions themselveshave been made in the wrong areas, and without clear strategicthought. I am particularly upset with the nature of the cuts asthey affect the department under my authority.   ``On three separate occasions, the uniformed and civilianleadership of the Navy Department provided the secretary of defensewith proposed cuts totaling the amount required to meet the budgetreduction, but which also would preserve the cherished goal of youradministration to rebuild our Navy to a minimum level of 600 ships.   In each case, the advice of this senior leadership, concurred inby the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was ignored. I can only conclude thatthe decision to reduce the level of our fleet to a point that itmay never reach the 600-ship goal was motivated by other thanmilitary and strategic reasoning.   During the four years I have served in your administration, Ihave repeatedly expressed my gratitude at your decision to rebuildthe greatest Navy in the world. Since I became secretary of theNavy last year, I have stated just as frequently my belief that theforce levels of our sea services remain minimal and must not bereduced.   Even in the current budget environment, such force levels couldhave been maintained. Since recommendations to that effect wererejected by your secretary of defense, I am unable to support himpersonally, or to defend this amended budget during budgetdeliberations. Consequently, I find it necessary to resign from myposition as secretary of the Navy.   Thank you for the opportunity to have served our country duringfour of our nation's most critical and productive years.   Respectfully yours,   James H. Webb Jr.</TEXT></DOC>
