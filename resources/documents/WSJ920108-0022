The institutions are among 45 credit unions and smallbanks closed by the state last year. Although 36 havereopened with federal deposit insurance, many of the largestinstitutions weren't able to get insurance and thus haveremained closed.</LP><TEXT>   Northeast Federal, based in Hartford, Conn., confirmed areport in the American Banker that its Northeast Savings F.A.unit is holding talks with state officials to buy EastProvidence, Columbian, Providence Teachers and GreaterProvidence and Trust credit unions.   Under the proposed agreement, the state of Rhode Islandand depositors would, in effect, subsidize the acquisition.Depositors -- who haven't had access to most of the money intheir accounts at the closed institutions -- would have touse $23 million collectively from their deposits to buysenior debt from Northeast Federal; Northeast could opt topay interest on the debt in additional debentures for fiveyears.   The state of Rhode Island also would buy $40 million ofpreferred stock from Northeast, which would pay a dividend onthe shares.   In addition, in acquiring about $350 million in assets ofthe four credit unions, Northeast would have six months todetermine the losses on the credit unions' portfolios and thestate would be required to cover those losses.   George Rutland, chairman and chief executive officer ofNortheast Federal, said federal regulators have estimatedthat the losses would be at least $40 million. &quot;It'simpossible to tell at the present time. They're {state} goingto have to put up whatever it is,&quot; he said.   The state also would create a $10 million account forNortheast to be used if lawsuits occur because of thetakeover, said Mr. Rutland. Northeast added that it also isnegotiating to be indemnified by the state against possibleenvironmental liabilities attached to the credit unions.   Northeast said it would use the proceeds from the sale ofstock and debt securities to help retire about $60 million ofpreferred stock held by the Resolution Trust Corp.   The closing of the 45 institutions on Jan. 1, 1991, hascaused a year-long political crisis in Rhode Island anddeepened the recession in the state. Angry depositors contendthat the state was lax in overseeing the private depositinsurance company, whose funds were depleted after thefailure of a small Providence bank.   Of the nine institutions that are still closed, two otherRhode Island credit unions are in the process of beingreopened after being acquired. Three others are beingliquidated because buyers can't be found and they havesustained such huge losses that they haven't been able toqualify for deposit insurance.</TEXT></DOC>
