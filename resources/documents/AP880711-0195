(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Under the sunlit arch of a plasticgreenhouse, an artificial swamp of cattails and elephant grasssprouts from hydroponic troughs, soaking sustenance from a city'ssewage.   This could be the waste treatment plant of the future.   Picture it: A natural system that uses microbes and marsh plantsto transform raw sewage into sparkling clean water. Unlikeconventional sewage facilities, which cost a fortune to run, thisone makes money. It leaves no nasty sludge. It creates energy. It'sso pretty it can be used as a park.   ``We're looking at a whole new generation of waste treatmentthat's cheaper and much more efficient than anything that'savailable now, and produces useful resources,'' said WilliamJewell, a Cornell University agricultural engineer.   Beside Ithaca's new $40 million conventional treatment plant,which settles, aerates and chemically treats about 5 milliongallons a day, Jewell has set up a pilot model of his system withthe capacity to purify 10,000 gallons of sewage a day _ about what100 people would produce.   The demonstration is funded by the state energy office and theGas Research Institute, a utility-sponsored group trying to findnew sources of natural gas.   In Jewell's system, raw sewage is partially cleaned in a tankfulof bacteria, then piped into long, low troughs in a greenhouse,where it provides a ``nutrient film'' on which plants thrive. Theplants are grown hydroponically _ with no soil. Their roots form adense mat as they soak up the pollutants.   A bonus to Jewell's sewage plant is that methane, sold asnatural gas, is produced by the first-stage bacterial process. Morecan be made by harvesting the plants and putting them through adigester using the same bacteria.   Jewell figures a plant with the capacity to handle the sewage of10,000 people could generate $400,000 worth of methane a year. Heestimates that for a community of 10,000, his system would costless than $1 million to build, compared to at least $5 million fora conventional plant.   ``These are the wastewater treatment system of the future forsmall towns, especially since the federal grant money for sewagetreatment has dried up in the last few years,'' said B.C.Wolverton, at NASA's National Space Technology Laboratory in BaySt. Louis, Miss.   Wolverton's artificial marshes, which use floating plants likewater hyacinths or rooted ones like bulrushes, have treated all thechemical waste and sewage from the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration lab for more than 12 years. ``We've saved manymillions of dollars by using these systems.''   Most of the systems that Wolverton has designed are for towns offewer than 3,000 people. But an experimental system in San Diego,using water hyacinths to make potable water from sewage, isexpected to handle a million gallons a day.</TEXT><HEAD>This Oceanographer is No Jacques Cousteau</HEAD><DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Frank Sciremammano gets seasick and hasmore stories about getting stuck in airports than getting stuck atsea.   So it may seem surprising that NASA has given him more than$100,000 in grants the past two years to study the Antarctic Ocean.   Sciremammano, a professor at Rochester Institute of Technology,has only actually seen the Antarctic twice, but he believes heknows as much about it as anyone, thanks to satellites andcomputers.   ``Satellite oceanography is still in its infancy, but more andmore people are getting interested,'' he said. ``When I got startedin 1984 there were really only two or three groups involved.''   Now, there are textbooks on the subject and seminars to discussnew developments in the field that involves sophisticated radarmeasurements taken by satellite to study a wide range ofinformation about the ocean's behavior.   Sciremammano says satellites can revolutionize some aspects ofoceanography because scientists will no longer be limited to bitsand pieces of data.   ``The satellites provide a global picture that traditionalmethods can't,'' he said. ``You can put instruments in the waterand get a lot of wonderful information, but only about thatparticular point.''   So Sciremammano pores over charts and tables, checks hiselectronic mailbox and keeps stacks of computer disks in his office.   He said his research, which focuses on the nature of thecircumpolar current which swirls around the continent of Antartica,could someday provide some definitions for the El Nino, anunexplained weather phenomenon that causes severe droughts andflooding on both sides of the Pacific Ocean, and for themuch-talked about ``greenhouse effect.''   Sciremammano admits that his work _ he teaches mechanicalengineering _ and his landlocked location make him somewhat of anoddball oceanographer.   ``That has its advantages. People leave me alone. I don't havecolleagues coming down to tell me about their latest adventure,''he said. ``But I do feel a little isolated sometimes.''</TEXT><HEAD>Desert Creature Points Way to Precious Water</HEAD><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tiny crustaceans that don't behave like youraverage desert dwellers may help identify potentially fertilefarmland in arid regions.   On the barren waste near Moshe Shakah's office at Sde Boker inthe Negev desert, pine, carob and pistachio trees grow withoutirrigation in an area that averages only 3{ inches of rain a year.The reason, Shahak says, is a grayish, segmented, armor-platedrelative of the wood louse known as an isopod.   The species Shahak is studying _ Helilepistus realuluri _ has aname longer than its .7-inch-long body.   ``The isopod has two qualities you'd never expect to find in thedesert,'' says Shahak, a Ben Gurion University desert ecologyspecialist who has studied the isopods since 1972. ``Its rate ofwater loss is very high and it has an inflexible life routine.''   In order to survive the summer, when temperatures soar over 104degrees, the isopods must find soil with a moisture content of 6percent to 10 percent. The family _ an adult male and female and upto 90 offspring _ digs a tunnel up to 27 inches deep, knowingintuitively where the moisture content of the soil will be highenough to sustain them, Shahak says.   As they burrow, the isopods leave a tell-tale mound of chewed-upsoil above ground, indicating their presence and thus the presenceof life-sustaining soil under the hard desert surface, he says.   Shahak found a direct correlation between the number of isopodsand the presence of moisture in the soil.   Aharon Yair, a Hebrew University geomorphologist, verifiedShahak's data, which contradicted current belief that the soil withthe highest water content was found at the bottom of desert valleybeds. Yair's readings showed that isopods dig their holes halfwaydown the slopes of the desert hills, at the point where the rockends and the soil begins.   Dr Eliyahu Ravitz, an expert on desert research at HebrewUniversity's Faculty of Agriculture, says that the findings areinteresting, but that most trees need soil with at least 20 percentwater content.   Shahak said he increased the moisture in the areas pinpointed byisopods by digging holes to trap rainwater not normally absorbed bythe baked earth.   He believes his findings could help solve the severe foodshortages caused by extended periods of drought in Ethiopia andother African nations.   ``If it works here, it will work in Africa too,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for July 14</NOTE></DOC>
