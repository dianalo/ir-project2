<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-62-0872 </DOCNO><TEXT>The non-linear evolution of initially small disturbances at an interfaceseparating two fluids of different density and velocity and includingsurface tension effects is investigated with the use of the vortex-sheetdiscretization approach. The location of the interface is tracked intime by following the motion of each vortex under the combined influenceof all other vortices. Viscous diffusion is taken into account by allowingthe core of the vortices to grown in time, while the influence of surfacetension and density discontinuity is incorporated in an equation governingthe evolution of the circulation of each vortex. Surface tension, diffusion,and large density ratios are shown to reduce the growth of the disturbance.</TEXT></DOC>
