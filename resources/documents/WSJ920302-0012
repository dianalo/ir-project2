In a shift from his long-held position that phonecompanies should transmit video programming only for others,FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes told lawmakers that phone companiesshould be allowed to own a portion of the programming theywould carry. Under current law, phone companies aren'tallowed to carry cable-television programming, and cablesystems cannot handle general telephone traffic.</LP><TEXT>   In testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee'scommunications panel, Mr. Sikes also said that cable systemsshould be allowed to carry phone calls. He said he supportedthe goals of a Senate bill aimed at speeding up constructionof fiber-optic phone networks, but he expressed reservationsabout certain provisions.   The bill would allow phone companies to program up to 25%of the capacity of fiber-optic networks, but Mr. Sikes didn'tendorse a specific level. Limits on phone companyprogramming, as well as a requirement that phone companiesrun their TV business out of separate subsidiaries, wouldpreclude the possibility of anticompetitive behavior, hetestified. Both restrictions, he suggested, could expire in10 years once robust competition developed.   The bill, which is sponsored by Sens. Conrad Burns (R.,Mont.) and Albert Gore (D., Tenn.), isn't considered likelyto pass this year, but the debate is likely to intensify nextyear as phone companies push to enter the cable business.</TEXT></DOC>
