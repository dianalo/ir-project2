Sullivan, in testimony to a House subcommittee Wednesday, alsosaid the Bush administration is ``strongly opposed'' to programs togive clean needles to drug addicts because they can be viewed assanctioning drug abuse.   However, pressed by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., subcommitteechairman, the secretary agreed to convene an expert panel torecommend how such programs could be studied scientifically. He saidthe panel could report back to the subcommittee in several weeks.   Sullivan had said in a March interview with The Associated Pressthat he did not believe needle exchanges condone drug abuse and thefederal government would be ``very supportive'' of communitiesexperimenting with such programs.   Many experts believe the deadly AIDS virus has been spreadthrough the population partly by the use of previously-used needlesby drug addicts.   Sullivan's statements marked the second issue on which he hasbackpedaled after straying from the Bush administration line.Earlier, his statements that he supported the Supreme Court decisionlegalizing a woman's right to abortion nearly derailed hisnomination. Later, he said he opposed abortion except in cases ofrape, incest and danger to the mother's life.   At Wednesday's hearing before the House Energy and Commercehealth subcommittee, he did not answer directly when asked if hisviews had changed since March.   But he said ``what has occurred is that I have had extensivediscussions'' with AIDS and drug abuse experts as well as members ofCongress about the issue.   Sullivan's earlier statements alarmed some in the Bushadministration, including drug czar William Bennett. At the time,presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush ``is opposed toexchangeable needles under any condition.''   In March, Sullivan said, ``As someone who is concerned abouthealth, if this is a strategy that shows promise of helping toarrest the spread of AIDS, I think this is something that doesdeserve a chance for an appropriate trial.''   However, asked Wednesday if he would support needle exchanges ifthey were shown scientifically to be effective, he said he stillwould ``want to consult with the other members of the Cabinet,Bennett and others, to look at this thoroughly.   ``We want to gather all the information that we can about theseprograms, and because of the fact that there has not been evidence,clear evidence that these programs are effective, we are notprepared to advocate or come forth with programs,'' he said.   Sullivan said his department planned no efforts to conduct itsown evaluation of the effect of clean-needle programs, but he saidthe National Institute on Drug Abuse, which is part of HHS, wouldconsider applications for research grants for others.   Needle-exchange programs are underway in several U.S. cities,including New York; Tacoma, Wash.; and Boulder, Colo. Abroad,England, Australia, Sweden and the Netherlands have such programs.   Sullivan said studies evaluating the effectiveness of some ofthese programs are ``not convincing'' because none has compared agroup of addicts receiving clean needles with a group that is not.Also, it is not clear whether findings that show decreased needlesharing and no increase in drug abuse are resulting from otherfactors, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
