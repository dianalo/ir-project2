Most of the other widely watched U.S. stock averages have already set new highs.    But even more striking is how the strength in American stocks is being matched by surging prices in most of the world's equity markets.    Tokyo's market, defying some Americans' predictions that its towering stock prices could only lead to a terrible plunge, has kept climbing to a record. West Germany's stock market is up 17% since April. London has been strong, and Stockholm is up a whopping 63% from its low point of the past 12 months. Political turmoil in Italy hasn't stopped its equity market from setting highs since the 1987 crash.    Hong Kong stocks are an exception. They rose steadily in the 1989 first half but then dropped, undermined by the upheaval in China and an uncertain future after the British colony reverts to Chinese control in 1997; even so, they are down only 3.3% for the year.    Yoshindo Takahashi, the president of Nomura Securities Co.'s research arm in the U.S., notes that for the moment, anyway, the world's markets seem to have forgotten about some of the problems that rattled them in the past: oil shocks, international debt problems, inflation worries and U.S. budget deficits.    That spate of amnesia was evident on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. The Dow Jones Industrials climbed above their old closing high of 2722.42 before easing back on profit taking to end at 2712.63, up 26.55 points on the day.    What's sparking the gains in country after country?    Foreign stocks have been pulled higher partly by the updraft from Wall Street. The U.S. economy, for all its problems, is still a dominant force, and, consequently, so is the U.S. stock market.    &quot;The most important unifying theme is that the Federal Reserve in the U.S. has so far been able to achieve a soft landing without putting the U.S. economy into a recession and {nevertheless} keep the rate of inflation within acceptable limits,&quot; says Graeme MacLennan, investment director at Ivory andamp; Sime PLC in Edinburgh, Scotland.    World-wide, equity investors have enjoyed a similar bouillabaisse of delectable trends: falling interest rates, solid corporate profits, steady economic growth, relatively low inflation and mostly hospitable political environments.    &quot;The world economies are still in a growth stage,&quot; says Matthew Windridge, the research chief at Banque Paribas Capital Markets Ltd. in London. Before the October 1987 market crash, he says, &quot;markets either got overheated or there was a potential for overheating. Now, markets are anticipating that that's been avoided and that the old cycle of four years of growth and two years of recession has been avoided.&quot;    About half of this year's international bull market is due to just a natural recovery from the global crash of two years ago, according to Anthony Regan, the chief international investment officer for Putnam Cos., a Boston fund-management firm. &quot;The crash is receding from memory,&quot; he says. &quot;You have prices that are generally no higher than before the crash, yet corporate earnings and dividends have continued to grow strongly.&quot;    Helping keep the bull market going have been political developments. &quot;There's been a confluence of a world-wide shift to the right, a pro-business bent and the globalization of markets and business,&quot; says Donald P. Haroz, the international portfolio strategist for Hoguet, Keller, Wittman andamp; Co., a New York money-management firm.    He cites the conservative governments of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Britain and Chancellor Hermut Kohl in West Germany; President Bush's administration, widely considered a friendly carry-over from Ronald Reagan's; in Japan, the continuing dominance of the free-market ideals of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, even though the party itself has become a bit wobbly. &quot;Even France, though it returned to a Socialist government, is socialist with a center-right flavor,&quot; Mr. Haroz says.    Mr. MacLennan of Ivory andamp; Sime notes the &quot;corporate takeover syndrome, not just in the U.S. but the U.K., where we are getting megabids.&quot; Noting the $21.37 billion offer for B.A.T Industries PLC and the $5.67 billion that Hanson PLC paid for Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, he adds: &quot;Even by American standards, these are enormous bids.&quot;    Much of Europe's acquisition activity has been sparked by the plan to pull down trade barriers in the 12-nation European Community in 1992. Although takeovers, particularly hostile ones, remain relatively rare on the Continent, money managers expect more and more of them in West Germany, France and the Netherlands. The prospect of an increasingly competitive environment after 1992 also has been encouraging companies to control costs and raise productivity -- moves that bolster their profits and their stocks.    Simultaneously, Mr. Windridge of Paribas says, &quot;markets are anticipating the end of the cold war and the potential for much more trade with the East Bloc.&quot; So far, the biggest beneficiaries have been the West German and Austrian stock markets because of those countries' traditionally strong trading relationships.    Also propelling the global bull markets have been ample liquidity -- available cash -- and solid corporate profits. Major central banks, fearing a global recession after the market crash, relaxed their monetary policies to reduce interest rates. At the same time, some economists say, the currency-stabilization moves since February 1987 have forced central banks to intervene heavily in foreign-exchange markets. That also has lead to easier credit policies, especially in Japan. The upshot: A lot of money has been sloshing around the world, and institutional money managers have been pouring it into stock markets.    For institutions -- not individuals -- are powering this year's rally. Small investors were clobbered by the crash and &quot;in most countries are still nervous about buying equities,&quot; Putnam's Mr. Regan says.    Foreign investors are also playing a role, and the smaller the market the greater their influence. Foreigners represent only about 3% to 4% of the total value of the Tokyo stock market, but they can account for as much as 15% to 20% of some smaller bourses, analysts say. They specifically point to the Spanish, Australian, Austrian and Scandinavian markets.    &quot;One of the biggest influences in overseas markets is Japanese money,&quot; says Mr. MacLennan of Ivory andamp; Sime, which manages funds for two large Japanese institutions. He says that as they grow more knowledgeable about foreign equities, Japanese institutions such as life insurers and trust banks are diversifying their equity investments away from Wall Street -- which used to account for as much as 90% of their overseas stock portfolios.    Foreign money can be mixed blessing, however. &quot;If you see a major correction, foreign money is likely to move very quickly,&quot; says Mr. Windridge of Paribas. In addition, money managers warn that foreign institutions, which look at more than just stock prices, may shift large sums quickly if currency expectations change markedly.    The 1987 crash, coupled with this year's bull market, persuades some analysts that global equity markets are generally linked in the direction they move, though their movements vary widely in degree. Thus, Mr. MacLennan says, &quot;if we hit a glitch, all the stock markets&quot; may well slump.    However, many analysts remain cautiously optimistic for the rest of this year and into the 1990 first quarter, though few expect stock-market gains matching those since the crash. Behind the optimism: a combination of stable commodity prices, receding inflation and high liquidity. In addition, most economists see interest rates generally falling, except in Japan.    Moreover, the global economic slowdown that would accompany lower interest rates may not affect all countries simultaneously. A recent study by Salomon Brothers contends that business cycles in the U.S., Japan and West Germany -- the three biggest economies -- are less synchronized than at any time in the past 20 years. Nicholas P. Sargen, an economist at Salomon, says that while the U.S. economy is slowing quickly, economic growth in Japan and Germany is exceeding expectations.    Moreover, both Japan and Germany are expected to stimulate their domestic economies, Mr. Sargen says. Japan's cabinet recently approved a tentative budget calling for a 3% rise in spending, the biggest increase in a decade. West Germany is scheduled to cut income taxes.    &quot;Thus, while the U.S. economy is currently slowing, a slowdown in Japan and Germany may not occur until next year,&quot; Mr. Sargen says. Therefore, he views the risk of a global recession as &quot;slight.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
