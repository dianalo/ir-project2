The contracts were awarded to General Dynamics Corp., McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Rockwell International Corp. Over the next 36 months, each separately will produce parts to be subject to thermal, stress and aerodynamic testing.    In this phase of the project, the three airframe manufacturers are still in competition for the best design, but the Pentagon has yet to decide whether the final production contract will be awarded to a single winner or to two or more working as a team. Boeing Co. and Lockheed Corp. were eliminated from the competition to build the vehicle's airframe.    A Pentagon spokesman called the decision to grant the awards a &quot;major milestone&quot; signaling that the project participants are confident that they can build a plane that can reach hypersonic speed -- or five times the speed of sound -- and enter into earth orbit without the use of disposable rockets. &quot;In effect, we're out of the paper design phase and into the building of large-scale components to demonstrate what the plane can do,&quot; the spokesman said.    As announced earlier, the remaining three airframe manufacturers will collaborate with two designated engine-makers, United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitney unit and Rockwell International, in producing components for ground-testing in 1990. The engine manufacturers were awarded $85 million each last August for the first 18 months of this phase.    If the contractors succeed in proving their technology in 1990, the program will go on to the next stage, involving building and flight-testing the experimental craft, called X-30.    Other contract awards announced by the Defense Department include the following:    Gould Defense Systems Inc., a unit of Gould Inc., received a $54.8 million addition to a Navy contract for Mark-48 torpedoes.    Rockwell International Corp. received a $34.4 million addition to a Navy contract for navigation equipment.    Brunswick Corp. received an $11.5 million Defense Logistics Agency contract for chemical protective gloves. </TEXT></DOC>
