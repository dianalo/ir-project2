DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rock 'n' roll and rap musicians rallied acrossthe street from the White House on Monday to protest groups theysay want to censor their music.   ``I think the framers of our Constitution would not have wantedto create a constitutional revolution where you couldn't rap andyou couldn't rock and you couldn't roll,'' Barry Lynn of theAmerican Civil Liberties Union told about 200 people in LafayetteSquare.   Attending the rally, held on the 200th anniversary of Congresssending the Bill of Rights to the states for ratification, wereJoseph Simmons of the rap group Run DMC and Vernon Reid of LivingColour. Statements from Frank Zappa and Bruce Springsteen were read.   The musicians' principal target was the Parents' Music ResourceCenter, a non-profit group that has been critical of what itconsiders violent and suggestive lyrics.   Among leaders of the Arlington, Va.-based group are Tipper Gore,wife of Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., and Susan Baker, wife ofSecretary of State James A. Baker III.   ``They are never going to be happy until the only thing thatthey see or hear is the America that they wish were out there, theAmerica that fits their cultural standards,'' Lynn said.   Jennifer Norwood, executive director of the Parents' MusicResource Center, said Monday that her group does not advocatecensorship.   ``We do not support legislation and we don't supportrestrictions on popular music of any kind,'' she said.   ``We do support our voluntary agreement with the recordingindustry, which has been in effect since 1985. The individualrecord companies ... decide which albums are the ones that get theconsumer information. We don't play a role in that decision-makingprocess.''   The consumer information can include lyrics printed on albumcovers so parents can decide if they find the music's messageobjectionable.   Dave Marsh, master of ceremonies for the rally, said musiciansshould be able to ``sing about drugs and the gang culture andteen-age sexuality and a whole list of issues that need to be sungabout and talked about.''   He said Music in Action, a group that opposes Mrs. Gore'sorganization, had gathered 50,000 signatures protesting theactivities of the parents' group.   ``When we first did our concerts and this woman Tipper Gore ...said that it was our fault that people fight and do things likethat because she didn't have anything better to say,'' saidSimmons, known professionally as Run.   Living Colour's Reid said the parents' group was involved in``an attack on the creative impulse.''   ``Say somebody is writing a song that talks about sexualpolitics ... and in the course of that song they use profanity toexpress their anger about something,'' he said. ``If the censorshipgroups prevail, that artist will think twice about the kind oflyrics he is writing.''</TEXT></DOC>
