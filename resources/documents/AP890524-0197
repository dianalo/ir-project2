(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Science is at the point where humandiseases can be attacked on the molecular level, doctors saidWednesday at the opening of a $50 million center devoted to joininglaboratory work and patient care.   More than 20 international scientists, including five NobelPrize winners, gathered at ceremonies and a symposium at theBeckman Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine at StanfordUniversity.   ``I don't think it's too far off base to say that the new era ofgenetic and molecular medicine will offer changes as significant tomedical sciences as occurred more than 100 years ago whenscientists discovered that bacteria were the underlying cause ofdisease,'' said Nobelist Paul Berg, director of the center.   David Korn, dean of Stanford's medical school, said the centerhas attracted at least 40 ``world-class medical scientists'' andwould have an annual budget of $20 million to $40 million.   The center, adjacent to Stanford Hospital, has brought togethersuch researchers as molecular scientists and doctors specializingin pediatrics, infectious diseases and other areas.   ``The right mind, looking at a frustrating clinical problem canoften come up with an insight, which if transferred back into theright scientific environment, can open up a whole new field ofresearch,'' Korn said.   Other Nobel laureates at the symposium were David Baltimore ofthe Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Michael Brown andJoseph Goldstein of the University of Texas Southwestern MedicalSchool and Arthur Kornberg of Stanford.   Controlling genetic diseases, such as sickle cell anemia andcertain cancers, through molecular genetics were among the paperspresented at the three-day symposium.   ``All along we've said that this line of research will lead tosignificant advances and benefits in medicine,'' said Berg. ``Now Ithink they are very close at hand. In the next decade, the impactof molecular genetics in medicine will be mind-boggling. I expectwe'll see a succession of major breakthroughs in understanding and,ultimately, in dealing with human disease.''   Researchers in molecular and genetic medicine seek to understandhuman disease or physiology in terms of molecules and genes, Bergsaid.   ``The idea of the program is to reach out and encompasseverybody who shares that same philosophical perspective,'' he said.   The center and a few others like it will speed up application ofresearch work because they provide ``a very necessary channel ofcommunication between the patient and the laboratory,'' Korn said.``It really is a two-way street. It isn't only from the laboratoryto the bedside.''   Molecular biologists are probing genetic susceptibility inpeople to particular forms of arthritic disease and identifyingcertain kinds of cells that cause arthritic damage. The researchersare trying to inactivate those specific harmful cells withoutshutting down the whole immune system.   The same strategy is being used in infantile diabetes andmultiple sclerosis.   There also is evidence that certain genetically designed growthhormones would allow doctors to push radiation therapy andchemotherapy to higher levels than ever in fighting cancer. Thehormones would be used to protect and rescue the bone marrow fromobliteration by the therapy.   Another area of research is the search for a tiny group ofpowerful cells that, when activated by a hormone, specifically goafter kidney cancers without injuring anything else.   ``Talk about magic bullets! This is a kind of magic bullet thateverybody's been looking for,'' Korn said.   Still another frontier of research is the study of how cells inthe nervous system communicate with each other on a molecular level.   Korn cautioned against misinterpreting scientists' enthusiasmfor breakthroughs in the laboratories, or successful tests withsome patients, with promises of imminent cures for cancer and otherdiseases.   ``I do think this is a revolution and I do think that molecularbiology is going to have as profound effects on medicine asanything that's happened in the history of biological science,'' hesaid. ``But I'm not going to tell you that one year from now wewill have cures for a lot of diseases.''</TEXT></DOC>
