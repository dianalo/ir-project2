The biggest deal in history _ the $25 billion leveraged buyout ofRJR Nabisco Inc. by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp;Co. _ was not included in the annual list because the buyout won'tbe completed until 1989.   Also pending at year's end was Grand Metropolitan PLC's $5.7billion takeover of Pillsbury Co., the magazine said in its reportto be published in the Jan. 30 issue.   Fortune said the total value of the 50 largest business dealslast year was $111.8 billion, easily surpassing the $94.6 billionvalue of the 50 biggest deals in 1985, the previous record for themagazine's list.   Last year's transactions provided at least $687 million inadvisory fees to those overseeing the deals _ also a record for thelist _ not counting commissions on related financing, Fortune said,citing public documents and other sources.   Despite the publicity over the RJR Nabisco deal, Fortune saidmost of last year's takeovers and restructurings were done theold-fashioned way: not by corporate raiders wielding borrowed money,but by corporate managers eyeing expansion.   The No. 2 deal last year was Canadian developer Robert Campeau's$6.5 billion acquisition of Federated Department Stores Inc., theyear's biggest deal involving a foreign company, Fortune said.   In third place was the $5.15 billion buyout of Farmers GroupInc., the California insurance company, by British tobacco-retailingconglomerate BAT Industries PLC.   The No. 4 deal was the $5.09 billion acquisition of Sterling DrugInc. by Eastman Kodak Co.   In fifth place was Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.'s $4.7 billiondeal to pay a special dividend to stockholders of the railroad andnatural resources company to fend off a takeover bid by the HenleyGroup.   In sixth place was the Kroger Co.'s $3.9 billion deal to pay aspecial dividend to fight takeover bids for the supermarket chainfrom Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Haft family.   The No. 7 deal, the $3.6 billion buyout of papermaker Fort HowardCorp., was the only leveraged buyout in the top 10.   In eighth place was the $3 billion acquisition of TrianglePublications Inc., which publishes TV Guide, by Rupert Murdoch'sNews Corp.   The No. 9 deal was the $2.8 billion stock buyback by UAL Inc.,the parent company of United Airlines.
