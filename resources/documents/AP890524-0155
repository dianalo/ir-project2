WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The West German president calledWednesday for unity within the NATO alliance and warned politiciansagainst letting the pursuit of votes sway policy.   In an address marking the nation's 40th anniversary, PresidentRichard von Weizsaecker criticized a ``majority mandate'' style ofleadership in a reference apparently aimed at Chancellor HelmutKohl.   Kohl is at the center of a dispute with NATO over the fate ofshort-range nuclear weapons based on West German soil. Bonn hasinsisted on immediate superpower talks to remove the short-rangemissiles in defiance of the alliance's plan to upgrade the rockets.   Kohl's position was seen to follow a general drift to the leftamong West Germans, who believe recent improvements in East-Westrelations warrant some relaxation of military policies. It was seenas an attempt to reverse a major slide in popularity for Kohl'sconservative Christian Democratic Union.   ``It is not high-handedness that is the greater danger, butrather an attempt, in pursuit of votes, to simultaneously fulfilltoo many wishes,'' Weizsaecker told politicians, diplomats andcelebrities attending the festivities.   He called for unity within the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization. The alliance begins a meeting Monday and theshort-range missile crisis will be high on the agenda.   ``Under the conditions of the Cold War it was easy to beunited,'' Weizsaecker said of the alliance. ``It becomes moreuncomfortable when the world no longer gives clear information onwho is for us and who is against us.''   Weizsaecker praised Soviet reforms and called for new thinkingin the West as well. He warned, however, that despite the warmingtrend in East-West relations, it would be unthinkable to stray fromthe alliance.   ``We in West Germany are irrevocably embedded in the EuropeanCommunity and the Atlantic Alliance,'' Weizsaecker said. ``Asuperpower we are not, but neither are we the plaything ofanother.''   Parliament President Rita Suessmuth, who also addressed thegathering in the flower-decked Beethoven Hall, said the continuingdivision of Germany marred the celebrations.   ``In spite of the gratitude we feel today, we cannot besatisfied with the situation of a nation divided by walls andbarbed wire,'' Mrs. Suessmuth said. On Tuesday, the 69-year-oldWeizsaecker was re-elected to a second five-year term. In hisacceptance speech, he praised West German economic prowess but saidmuch work lies ahead.   ``We have no ground for self-satisfaction,'' Weizsaecker said.``We have not become angels under the Basic Law.''   The Basic Law, adopted May 23, 1949, is the constitutionalfoundation of West Germany and has won praise for guiding thedefeated nation from ruin to international respect.   West Germany is the world's largest exporter and enjoys one ofthe highest standards of living. But Weizsaecker suggested thenation's way of life is threatened by resistance to social change.</TEXT></DOC>
