The president hopes his latest plan, the construction byAmerican troops of formal refugee camps inside Iraq, can becarried out in a matter of weeks. The administration iscalculating that it then simply can hand the new reliefsystem over to the United Nations, coax refugees to beginreturning to their homes, and quietly withdraw the U.S.troops.</LP><TEXT>   But the new plan is seen in Congress and elsewhere as onlya temporary solution that raises the prospect of a lengthy,Palestinian-like problem unless the Kurds are moved closer totheir real homes in Iraq. &quot;Forty years from now we may becursed the same way the Palestinian camps curse us now,&quot; saidHouse Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell(D., Mich.).   As a result, the administration faces growing calls, fromboth supporters and critics of its war against Iraq, to set along-term strategy to help Iraqis who fear Saddam Hussein.   House Speaker Thomas Foley has set the tone forcongressional reaction by generally supporting Mr. Bush whileasserting that the steps now being taken can only betemporary. &quot;It would be extremely unfortunate if the Kurdishpopulation were to live for a long period in these camps,&quot;the Washington Democrat said. &quot;The culture and life ofraising a generation in camps such as have existed in otherparts of the world has terrible consequences.&quot; Mr. Foleyadvocates the use of economic pressure -- specifically, acontinued oil embargo -- to put pressure on Iraq to allow therefugees to return home safely.   But others go further, saying U.S. military presence maybe needed farther inside Iraq to help the Kurds. &quot;The goalhas to be to get them back to their villages,&quot; said SenateArmed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), whovoted against approving the war. &quot;The principle is alreadyestablished that we are on Iraqi soil. Why not protect themwhere they can live?&quot;   Mr. Bush is adamant about avoiding deeper militaryinvolvement. But his strategy is based partly on hopes thatevents will unfold favorably for the U.S. inside Iraq andpartly on an assumption that the U.N. will assume more of theburden than it has been able to so far.   The administration's fondest wish remains that the Iraqiarmy will get rid of Saddam Hussein, producing a governmentthat Kurdish and Shiite refugees will see as lessthreatening. If that doesn't happen, the administration plansto try to incorporate the new refugee base camps it isbuilding into a broader U.N. relief effort being coordinatedby Sadruddin Aga Khan, a special envoy of U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.   The problem, though, is that when U.S., British and Frenchtroops depart the camps in northern Iraq, there likely willbe a need for a U.N. military force to take their place. Thatprobably would require a new U.N. Security Councilresolution, and there is deep fear in the U.S. that China,always leery of international interference in Third Worldcountries, would veto it. In that case, Mr. Bush may face theunpleasant option of turning the camps over to U.N. civiliansand hoping that the Iraqi military doesn't move in.   In many respects, the options now being debated are areplay of the debate between economic sanctions and militaryaction that raged before the war. The president's supportersare split. Some conservatives fear the U.S. already has gonetoo far and won't be able to walk away from the camps. Theadministration has sought to relieve such concerns, and afterbriefings yesterday conservative lawmakers appeared satisfiedthat there is sufficient separation between the camps andIraqi forces that there won't be any danger to Americantroops.   Others think there isn't any risk in taking an even moreforceful stand. &quot;Even Saddam Hussein has learned the risks ofhurting an American soldier,&quot; said Rep. Robert Torricelli(D., N.J.).   The most severe option is presented by Rep. Stephen Solarz(D., N.Y.), who co-sponsored the January war resolution. Heargues the White House should seek a U.N. resolutionsupporting the removal of Saddam Hussein. Critics say theproposal is unrealistic and simply a political ploy to shiftblame to the U.N., but Mr. Solarz says Mr. Bush is &quot;graduallyand incrementally&quot; moving to the same position.   A more moderate approach -- and one with wider support --is aimed at enforcing a cease-fire internally in Iraq througha combination of economic pressure and an internationalpeacekeeping force to protect the refugees.</TEXT></DOC>
