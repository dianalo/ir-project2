Wolf, the former Republic Airlines executive who was tapped torun Chicago-based UAL in 1987, wasn't the only corporate officialwho stands to make a huge profit on the long-negotiated buyout.   If the $300-a-share deal goes through, John C. Pope, UAL's chieffinancial officer, stands to make $3 million on his 10,000 sharesand $34.65 million for his options.   Wolf and Pope would continue to run the company under the buyoutplan, which calls for UAL workers to own 75 percent of the company.A management group headed by Wolf would own 10 percent and theremaining 15 percent would be held by British Airways PLC.   Other details of the plan were revealed in the massive SECdocuments, filed just before closing time Thursday and made publicFriday.   Just a week before the pilot-management agreement was reached,union leaders representing United pilots and flight attendants metfor an hour on Sept. 8 with representatives of Robert M. Bass GroupInc. ``to discuss whether there might be a basis for considering ajoint pilot-Bass Group bid for (UAL),'' according to the filing.   But ``the pilots reaffirmed their satisfaction with the jointpilot-management bid'' and ``determined to proceed with that bid.''   Bass, a billionaire Texas investor, has been mentioned previouslyin speculation about a UAL takeover.   United's largest union, the International Association ofMachinists and Aerospace Workers, has opposed the buyout.   In addition to contacts with the pilots and flight attendants,Bass has sought meetings with the Machinists to discuss whether theywould be interested in supporting his bid, according to theMachinists.   The documents also disclosed that while investor Marvin Davis wastrying to acquire UAL for as much as $275 a share, UAL's financialadviser First Boston Corp. also was in contact with an unidentifiedthird party ``that had previously indicated an interest in making aproposal to acquire'' UAL.</TEXT></DOC>
