The DWPF will be controlledbased on glass composition. The waste glass physical and chemical properties,such as viscosity, liquidus temperature, and durability are functionsof glass chemistry. Preliminary models have been developed to evaluatethe effects of feed composition variability on the glass properties.These properties are presently being related to the waste glass compositionin order to develop process control paradigms that include batching algorithms,hold points, and transfer limits. 3 refs., 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
