In New York, the last-minute choiceof Republican bosses is an economist who isn't evenregistered in the party. In Massachusetts, the leadingcandidate for the Democratic nomination may not even beallowed on the primary ballot.   New York's Governor Mario Cuomo is following the path ofMichael Dukakis as he raises every tax in sight in a futileattempt to close a yawning deficit. You'd think Republicanswould seize the opportunity to force a real debate on thestate's future. Wrong. A total of 16 people have declined torun.</LP><TEXT>   Last week party bosses refused to accept New YorkUniversity Dean Herbert London, a Republican who is alreadythe choice of the Conservative Party, as their own nominee.Instead, in a flurry of late-night meetings they anointedeconomist Pierre Rinfret as their man. Mr. Rinfret willlikely be ratified at the GOP state convention that openstoday.   Like Mr. Rinfret, Mr. London has little campaignexperience. But he is aggressively challenging thespendthrift Cuomo record. Mr. London wants the New YorkRepublican Party to finally cut free of its Rockefeller rootsand embrace privatization, tax cuts and a real effort atcrime control.   But GOP leaders have as their main focus protecting theironly patronage rice bowl -- control of the State Senate.Instead of Mr. London, they prefer the more subdued andliberal Mr. Rinfret, whom many GOP leaders admitted they hadnever met. Since he is a registered independent, the GOPexecutive committee will have to grant him a special waiverto run. Unless Mr. London wins votes from 20% of the bosses'hand-picked delegates at the state convention, Mr. Rinfretwill be unopposed on the GOP primary ballot.   In Massachusetts, Democratic bosses are also trying to usean archaic exclusionary rule to keep a viable candidate offthe ballot.   John Silber, the neoconservative president of BostonUniversity, is now the leading candidate for the Democraticnomination for governor. A Boston Herald poll gives him 28%,Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy 23% and Attorney General Frank Belotti19%. However, no candidate can appear on the Septemberprimary ballot unless he or she first wins 15% or more of thevotes cast at a state convention next month. Many partydelegates are teachers' union members who despise the fieryMr. Silber. He gets only 8% support in a delegate poll, whileMr. Belotti is first with 33%. Mr. Silber could still winenough sympathy votes to push him over 15%, but delegatesstrongly oppose lifting the rule. The Boston Herald claims&quot;they would rather deny 700,000 primary voters a realchoice.&quot;   The days when party bosses could pick a candidate behindthe scenes and force party members to accept the choice haveended in most states. New York and Massachusetts still retainanti-democratic methods for selecting candidates. In theory,state conventions are held to exclude fringe candidates. Inpractice, they are often an anti-democratic device to allowan entrenched party faction to retain power.   As the entire world seems to embrace open politicalprocesses, it's time to clear away some of the obstacles toeffective democracy in this country. Exclusionary rules suchas those in New York and Massachusetts only perpetuate thecontrol of party bosses, block new ideas and faces fromentering the public debate and increase the level of votercynicism and nonparticipation in elections.</TEXT></DOC>
