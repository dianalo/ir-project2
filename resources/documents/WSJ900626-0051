By a 5-4 vote, the high court ruled that, in the absenceof strong evidence of the intent of a patient who isincompetent, states aren't required to honor the wishes of apatient's family to stop artificial feeding and water and toallow the patient to die.</LP><TEXT>   The decision, written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist,is the Supreme Court's first foray into the legally andethically complex and highly emotional issue of the right todie. The ruling leaves the states substantial leeway to adopttheir own approaches, outlining some significant parametersfor legislatures to follow.   Most significantly, by emphasizing the need for clearevidence of a patient's wishes, the ruling is likely toencourage greater use of so-called living wills that allowindividuals to spell out in writing in advance their wishesabout being kept alive through tube feeding or other means.   Living-will laws vary widely, however, in the roughly 40states that have passed them. While most allow thetermination of artificial-breathing equipment and otherlife-support efforts, many don't specifically allow a personto authorize in advance the removal of feeding and watertubes. So, there is likely to be new pressure on statelegislatures to modify some living-will laws or to adopt newones.   Appeals courts or supreme courts in at least nine stateshave found either a state or federal constitutional right toprivacy that limits a state's ability to refuse to stopartificial feeding of patients in vegetative states. Theruling yesterday may affect those decisions if stateofficials try to impose new limits.   &quot;The ruling means that if you write down your wishes inadvance about tubefeeding, they will have to be takenseriously,&quot; said Fenella Rouse, a lawyer with the Society forthe Right to Die.   Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe agreed thatthe ruling &quot;will encourage more precise expressions&quot; of anindividual's wishes, but warned that &quot;living wills are notfoolproof&quot; as they may be challenged as insufficient evidenceof one's intent.   The emphasis on evidence of one's wishes was disturbing tothe American Medical Association. Nancy Dickey, an AMAtrustee, said, &quot;Written decisions made ahead of time are notthe best way to make choices about health care which ischanging all the time.&quot; The ruling, she said, &quot;is a voiceagainst the right of the doctor and patient to make decisionsat the bedside.&quot;   The court ruling left unresolved a major question relatedto the use of living wills. The court's majority said statesdon't have to honor the wishes of a patient's family; but thejustices didn't decide what approach states should take whena patient has designated a surrogate to make health-caredecisions, either through a living will or through apower-of-attorney appointment. In a separate opinion, JusticeSandra O'Connor, who joined the majority, said states may beconstitutionally required to recognize the authority ofsurrogate decisionmakers.   The justices recognized for the first time that theConstitution protects the decision of a person who iscompetent to make such judgments to refuse artificial feedingand water. &quot;That will help fortify the rights of patients,&quot;said Dr. Dickey.   The high court ruling came in the case of Nancy Cruzan, 32years old, who has been unconscious since January 1983, whenher brain was severely damaged by a lack of oxygen after acar accident in southwestern Missouri. Doctors say she won'trecover but that she could live for 30 years receiving foodand water through a tube. Her condition is described as a&quot;persistent vegetative state&quot; -- more alert than a coma, butstill unconscious. Her parents want to stop providing foodand water to her, saying that she expressed a desire in thepast not to live after a serious injury if she couldn'tfunction normally.   The Missouri Supreme Court refused to cut off her food andwater, finding her intent unclear. The Supreme Court upheldthat decision, saying a state may require a high standard ofproof of a patient's wishes.   Justice William Brennan dissented, joined by JusticesThurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun, saying she has afundamental right &quot;to choose to die with dignity.&quot; JusticeJohn Stevens also dissented.

A federal appeals court in the District of Columbiaaffirmed the FCC's order in a brief decision in November.   The FCC said that between Aug. 1, 1984, and Dec. 31, 1986,Comsat, which provides phone links, earned more than itsauthorized 12.48% return on investment. Comsat challenged theFCC's authority to order refunds and other retroactiverelief.   In its December 1987 order, the FCC said that Comsat mustdeposit the refund in an escrow account, while the FCCdecided how to disburse the money. Nearly all of it would goto American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and other long-distancecarriers, the FCC said, and the agency would order thecarriers to refund it to ratepayers.
