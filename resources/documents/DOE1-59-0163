By introducing site basisstates (local representation) we were able, in the limit of {Delta}/Gamma-barandless;andless;1,where {Delta} is the coupling interaction between the nearest neighborsand Gamma-bar is the average on-site anharmonic energy, to reduce theproblem to Anderson-like model for a one-dimensional electron systemwith diagonal disorder. Assuming a Cauchy distribution for on-site anharmonicity,we have calculated the degree of localization. It is shown that the degreeof localization increases with the increase of the randomness.</TEXT></DOC>
