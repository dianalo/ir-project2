ReservoirPlace 1601 Trapelo Rd.andP;  Waltham, MA 02154 (617) 890-4499 (800) 992-0085andM;List Price: FormWorx with Fill andamp; File, $149; FormWorx, $95.andM;Requires: 512K RAM, two disk drives, DOS 2.0 or later.andM;In Short: FormWorx's chief assets are its powerful data entry and databasefunctions.andP;  It runs strictly in text mode, so it can't handle fancy graphics,but if your forms are relatively simple, FormWorx does the job with aplomb.andO;Not copy protected.andP;  FormWorx with Fill andamp; File lets you create formson-screen and then fill them out with the aid of powerful database functions.andO;This $149 program from FormWorx Corp., works only in text mode.andP;  This is bothits main strength and its biggest weakness.andM;Getting started with FormWorx is much easier than with most graphics-basedforms packages, and it allows you to cook up simple forms much faster.andO;Moving or deleting elements is a straightforward process, not subject to theinevitable quirks of graphics-mode operation.andP;  And, of course, its text filesprint much more quickly than graphics files.andM;FormWorx's editing tools make it easy to create boxes, lines, and fillpatterns using the ASCII graphics characters.andP;  You can turn on word wrap orcenter text within a selected area.andP;  But you can't resize or align selectedelements or make proportions equal automatically.andP;  Nor can you create visualflourishes such as diagonal lines, background shading, boxes with roundedcorners, and lines of several different thicknesses.andM;You also cannot directly import graphics images into a form.andP;  The best youcan do is to create an overlay on your LaserJet with the image you want toprint on it.andP;  The manual has some guidelines on how to do this, but it's notan easy process, and converting .PCX files to the format required by theHewlett-Packard command language requires a separate utility program.andM;The version of FormWorx we tested didn't come with soft fonts, although thevendor says it plans to add these to the product's next release.andP;  FormWorxdoes let you mix different cartridge fonts in a form, but you must first callup a configuration menu and enter the printer control codes that turn thesefonts on and off.andP;  Another drawback: since all fonts are the same sizeon-screen, positioning them can be tricky.andM;FormWorx's lack of WYSIWYG representation forces you to scroll a form on thescreen to see it all, and that can make it difficult to judge its proportionsproperly.andP;  This problem is aggravated if you use the program's horizontal orvertical print-compression options, which let you use a small font to squeezea detailed form onto a single page or draw horizontal lines that come rightto the upper or lower edge of text (useful for underlining fill-in fields).andO;Since these options don't change the appearance of your form on-screen, youmust work with an elongated or widened version of what actually prints out.andM;DATABASE POWERandM;FormWorx is most capable when it comes to filling in your forms.andP;  To attachdatabase fields to the forms you create, you simply use the cursor toposition and size each field on the form.andP;  You can move through the fields onthe form in any order, and you can select data verification options from amenu.andP;  Menu options let you fill the current field with the system date ortime, carry a value over from the previous record, increment a serial number,or calculate a field from the values in other fields.andM;Each time you fill the form in, you collect and store the data as a record ina dBASE-compatible file, which can hold up to 32,000 records.andP;  The programcan also import and export ASCII data files.andP;  You can view or print recordsaccording to selection criteria, which can include range specifications andBoolean operators.andP;  You can even create a link to a second database file orselect user-defined field values from a lookup table.andP;  This allows you, forexample, to check the address and other related information automaticallywhen you enter a name on the form.andM;Unfortunately, there are some rather nasty facets to FormWorx's data-handlingmethods.andP;  For example, the program does not prevent you from creating invalidfields, and it's all too easy to end up with unexpected results when you'rechanging the database structure.andM;FOR THE POWER USERandM;The program is not easy to install.andP;  In fact, the difficulty involved inconfiguring the printer options and setting up a database with FormWorx willprobably prove too much for the average office worker.andP;  The vendor expectsthat a systems expert will handle the more-technical aspects of installation.andO;The company has accordingly included a powerful script language with thepackage, allowing you to create custom menus with user-defined prompts foreach selection.andM;With its powerful database features, FormWorx is an efficient way to turnlarge quantities of data into filled-out forms.andP;  It can be relatively quickand easy for designing simple forms, and it's certainly capable of veryattractive output.andP;  But for graphical sophistication and WYSIWYG display,you'll have to look elsewhere--or wait for the forthcoming MicrosoftWindows-based version of FormWorx.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
