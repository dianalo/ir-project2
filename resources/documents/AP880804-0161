(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Four of IBP Inc.'s meat-packing plants passeddetailed safety and health inspections by state and federalofficials, IBP Chairman Robert L. Peterson said in the company's1987 annual report.   Those inspections resulted in ``no headlines,'' Peterson said,in contrast to big headlines that followed allegations in July 1987by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.   OSHA levied a $2.59 million fine at IBP's Dakota Cityheadquarters plant, alleging that IBP did not report workerinjuries there.   ``We are vigorously appealing OSHA's Dakota City record-keepingassessment, which we believe is in error,'' Peterson said. ``Weexpect to be vindicated.''   ``IBP works hard to safeguard its employees,'' the report said.``We will put our track record on the line against any othermeatpacker in the country. It is a matter of common human decencyto be concerned about the safety of employees. In addition, ithappens to make good business sense.''   Unions representing IBP workers have long contended thecompany's plants are unsafe.   The inspections the four plants passed included safety practicesand employee protection during actual operations, Peterson said.   The annual report was the first by the company since its stockbecame available for public ownership last October. OccidentalPetroleum Corp. had owned IBP for six years and retains a 50.5percent ownership.   The report said a seven-month labor dispute last year at theDakota City plant had a satisfactory resolution but, together withstart-up costs for three new pork plants, cost the company nearly$20 million.   The strike ended with an eight-year labor agreement Petersonsaid will stabilize the company's labor situation.   ``We regret the continued confrontations at Dakota City,'' hesaid. ``However, we have the obligation at IBP to manage for thelong-term, profitable growth of our business. This will ultimatelybenefit our employees as well as our stockholders.''   He said the company had pre-tax losses of $4.9 million in 1987from starting operations at new pork facilities at Louisa Countyand Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Madison. The plants now areprofitable and are expected to be major contributors to IBP'searnings growth, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
