ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrats formally backed President Bush'sPersian Gulf policy Friday but coupled their endorsement with ascathing attack on his domestic policies.   A resolution adopted by the executive committee of theDemocratic National Committee denounced ``a decade of Republicangreed and debt'' and blamed the savings and loan scandal on``hear-nothing Republican regulatory policy.''   The resolution was the principal action at the opening sessionof the party's two-day meeting.   Another highlight was the appearance of Sen. Sam Nunn ofGeorgia, making his first speech to a national committee meeting.   Five years ago, Nunn was a founder of the Democratic LeadershipCouncil, which was created as a conservative counterweight to thenational party.   Nunn's denied his appearance before the executive committee wasa signal he is interested in running for president in 1992.   ``I have no inclinations or plans to run for president,'' Nunntold reporters who crowded around him as he left the party meeting.   The senator has stirred presidential speculation with suchactions as his resignation from the all-male Burning Tree golf cluband his recent declaration of support for abortion rights afterdecades of being in the opposition camp.   Nunn said his interest in party politics began with formation ofthe DLC, which he described as an effort to ``get the DemocraticParty back in the mainstream.''   Asked if he thought the people he'd just spoken to were now inthe mainstream, Nunn replied, ``Well, I don't know everybodyhere.''   Nunn said he didn't think the tendency of Americans to rallyaround the president in a time of crisis would hurt Democraticcandidates in the fall.   ``I don't think it's a partisan issue,'' he said. ``I don'tthink the public's going to be voting in November based on theMiddle East.''   Like the Democrats he addressed, Nunn was quick to praise Bush'shandling of the crisis.   ``I think he's done a very good job,'' said the senator.   The resolution adopted by the Democrats opened with thestatement that ``Today, our nation stands united in support ofAmerica's mission in the Middle East, united in opposition toIraq's aggression. We, the Democratic Party of the United States,do here formally express our support for our armed forces and thePersian Gulf policy of our commander-in-chief.''   The praise stopped at the shore of the Persian Gulf.   The next paragraph called on the nation to ``abandon Republicaneconomic policies.''   The party voiced agreement with Bush's call for spendingreductions but added that ``we insist that those reductions mustnot discriminate against those who benefited least from a decade ofRepublican greed and debt.''   It said, ``The Sandamp;L crisis is the certain result of do-nothingRepublican public philosophy, hear-nothing Republican regulatorypolicy, and see-nothing Republican administration of justice.''   The full Democratic National Committee was scheduled to adoptthe resolution at its meeting on Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
