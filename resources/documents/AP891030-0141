Gen. Herman Stadler, the police publicrelations chief said of the 70,000-member rally Sunday at a soccerstadium on the edge of Johannesburg.   It was the largest ever anti-government event, and virtuallyevery aspect violated security laws.   But authorities approved the event in advance and policemaintained a low profile as African National Congress leaders,released from prison Oct. 15, endorsed the organization's guerrillacampaign and called for increased economic sanctions against thewhite-run government.   ``There is no doubt this event will go down in history as themost dramatic, most poignant, and perhaps the most politicallysignificant since the start of the struggle for liberation,'' saidthe Sowetan, the nation's largest black-oriented daily newspaper.   The ANC has been outlawed since 1960, but Sunday's rally was theclearest signal yet that the government is willing to allowpeaceful public activities by the organization.   The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, said it would be betterto lift laws restricting political freedom than to enforce themselectively.   ``The best thing for (the government) to do, if it is not goingto apply the laws, is to do away with them,'' the editorial said.   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok told government-run TVSunday night that peaceful protest offers a needed outlet for thosewith political grievances.   ``I don't think we need to be afraid that these protests, whichare monitored, will break into violence,'' Vlok said.   But Andries Treurnicht, head of the pro-apartheid ConservativeParty, called for an urgent session of Parliament to debate thegovernment's relaxed stance toward protests.   ``The ANC, under its own flag and that of the Communist Partyalongside, is enjoying complete freedom to propagate its aims andambitions and issues one ultimatum after the other to thegovernment,'' Treurnicht said.   ``The government's authority to maintain law and order and toenforce the laws of the land is being blatantly challenged,'' headded.   Police spokesman Col. Vic Haynes said police were studyingSunday's rally to determine whether anyone should be prosecuted.   However, police have made similar statements after severalrecent demonstrations and have not taken any action.   When a magistrate approved Sunday's rally, he warned organizersnot to promote the aims of the ANC.   ``We refused,'' said Cyril Ramaphosa, a union leader and one ofthe main organizers. ``The ANC lives. It is amongst us.''   The seven ANC leaders freed unconditionally Oct. 15 appeared ona podium beneath huge banners of the ANC and the South AfricanCommunist Party. Six of the seven had spent at least 25 years inprison.   Deafening cheers erupted when the men, led by Walter Sisulu,slowly circled the playing field behind an honor guard of 20 youngmilitants, clad in khaki uniforms and marching in military style.   ``ANC! ANC!'' shouted the crowd, many dressed in the movement'scolors of green, black and gold.   Sisulu said his movement would never abandon its guerrillacampaign unilaterally but would consider suspending violence andentering talks if the government freed all political prisoners,legalized the ANC and lifted the state of emergency.   De Klerk, who assumed power in August, has offered to negotiatea new constitution within five years that would extend politicalrights to blacks but protect white interests. The ANC wants aconstitution that would establish a one-person, one-vote system.</TEXT></DOC>
