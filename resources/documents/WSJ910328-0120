Thatsentiment reflects the opinion of many of this nation's elitethat ill will toward Japan comes from &quot;misunderstandings&quot;about the country.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Shima hopes to launch his Global News Network -- orGNN -- by the middle of the year. Under that plan, NHK wouldjoin with leading American and European networks, eachcontributing eight hours a day of news.   In addition, NHK and Media International Corp. -- aconsortium staffed largely by former NHK employees and ownedby four dozen major Japanese companies -- are starting todisseminate Japanese shows overseas. Next month, the companywill begin broadcasting via satellite eight to 10 hours a dayof Japanese and English-language shows in the U.S. andEurope. For nearly two years, NHK has aired business andcultural programs in the U.S. on Public Broadcasting Servicestations.   &quot;Most of the companies&quot; supporting Media International&quot;have gone through U.S.-Japan economic friction,&quot; says TakaoYoshiki, a former official of Sumitomo Bank Ltd. and currentpresident of the consortium. &quot;So they understand the ideaabout Japan not being understood fully.&quot;   But Mr. Shima and his allies face a tough battle gettinganyone outside Japan to take their plans, or their programs,seriously. While consumers around the world eagerly snap upJapanese television sets, few U.S. networks want Japaneseprograms for mass audiences.   Mr. Shima repeatedly tells reporters that CapitalCities/ABC Inc. and the Geneva-based European BroadcastingUnion are likely partners for GNN. But those companies soundpolitely disinterested.   &quot;Mr. Shima's ideas are laudatory in principle but maybenot practical,&quot; an ABC executive says. &quot;We're keeping an openmind, but this isn't our main worry at the moment,&quot; echoesPierre Lantenac, who runs EBU's news projects.   The export of Japanese programming is only one leg of the63-year-old Mr. Shima's sweeping strategy to overhaul andinternationalize the network he took over three years ago.NHK and its Japanese cohorts are also buying and underwritingmore U.S. and European programming to air in the highlycompetitive Japanese market.   In December, Mr. Shima circulated world-wide a five-pagedocument outlining his ideas for GNN. The blueprint includesnews centers in New York, London and Tokyo. It estimates apotential market of 70 million households in the U.S., Europeand Japan within five years, raising revenue of 37 billionyen a year.   NHK also is forging closer ties with ABC. As early as thisweek, the two broadcasters are expected to announce a newwide-ranging contract. That will include NHK paying nearly$30 million to ABC over three years for exclusive rights tobroadcast ABC materials in Japan, about three times more thanNHK currently pays for the rights to ABC shows. The twonetworks already are working together, along with Gostelradioof the Soviet Union, on a series of programs titled &quot;A VisualHistory of the 20th Century.&quot;   But NHK and ABC seem to view their relationshipdifferently. While Mr. Shima preaches about GNN, ABC boastsabout selling more programs to Japan. American broadcastexecutives say NHK's programming, which tends to be drier,less analytical, and less graphically sophisticated, haslimited mass appeal in the U.S.   &quot;We will explore things, and if they make sensefinancially we'll go along,&quot; the ABC official said. &quot;We'renot saying we're on board for an open commitment.&quot; One NHKofficial describes the partnership as &quot;dosho, imu,&quot; aJapanese expression meaning &quot;same bed, different dreams.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
