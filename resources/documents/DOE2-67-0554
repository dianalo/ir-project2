<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-67-0554 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Brookhaven Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) is a 50-MeV electron linacdesigned to produce electron bunches which can be synchronized with thepicosecond pulse of a 100-GWatt CO{sub 2} laser. This facility will beused to study the acceleration of electrons by the laser-grating techniqueas well as by an inverse free-electron laser, and will also provide apicosecond source of x-rays via nonlinear Compton scattering. Here wereport on the design of the electron gun which will provide rf bunchesof up to 10{sup 10} electrons synchronized with the laser beam. (AIP)</TEXT></DOC>
