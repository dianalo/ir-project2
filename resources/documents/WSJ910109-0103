Aserpentine path led them around the pointed leaves of yuccacactus, around brittle sagebrush and impenetrable clusters oftumbleweed.   As they walked across the calm, sundrenched grassland Inoticed that one of the pair was shaking. &quot;Cold?&quot; I asked.&quot;No,&quot; he replied, &quot;excited to be here.&quot; Not a sportsman inthe world could blame him.</LP><TEXT>   The Kansas prairie that surrounded him is home to some ofAmerica's most magnificent whitetail and mule deer. Where thehabitat is right there are antelopes, wild turkeys andcountless coveys of quails and pheasants. Without a doubt,it's some of the finest game country that can be found today.   Yet the hunters were looking for a hunt of the past ratherthan the present. The short walk that took them to the top ofa small rise, in a way, took them back a dozen decades ormore. It was then that they saw it -- a half-ton, humpbackedanimal cloaked in a thick brown and chestnut coat, wearing apair of short, ebony horns on its massive head.   A stalk was planned and the hunters were off. Thoughunusual in modern times, a buffalo hunt is something that theplains above the Smokey Hill River had seen countless timesthrough the centuries.   &quot;This used to be some of the finest buffalo country inAmerica,&quot; said Wilbur Williams, as he looked out over theprairies of his Smoky River Buffalo Ranch, which offersguided hunting expeditions. The main season runs fromNovember through March. &quot;They were here in the millions; oldaccounts tell of herds stretching as far as the eye couldsee.&quot;   And according to Mr. Williams, a self-trained naturalistand historian, the vast herd attracted a variety of huntersthroughout the centuries. While roaming the ranch as both aboy and a man, Mr. Williams has found tools and weapons fromsuch past hunters as the Pawnee, Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes.   The grounds that now make up his buffalo ranch wereutilized by white hunters as well. Trappers headed for themountains and travelers headed for the promise of Californiaor Oregon relied on the buffalo for a source of food. Thosewho followed, however, relied on them as a source formoney-making hides.   &quot;This area was at the heart of the big buffalo-hunting eraof the late 1860s and 1870s,&quot; said Mr. Williams. &quot;There was alot of history made around here. Bill Cody and Bill Comstockhad their famous buffalo-hunting contest just north of hereto see who could use the name Buffalo Bill. And over theyears I've found at least two shoe boxes full of oldcartridges left behind by the hide hunters.&quot;   The original herds and the hide hunters disappearedroughly a century ago. A lifelong love of the big animalscaused Mr. Williams to bring them back. With a carefulbreeding program and supplementation, the native Kansan hasreestablished a self-sustaining herd here. And the huntershave returned, hunting an experience, trying to relive a lifeof old.   &quot;The main reason I came was to fulfill a lifelong dream,&quot;said Darrell Wuertz, one of the pair of hunters. &quot;Ever sinceI was little I dreamed about walking the ground where thebuffalo lived and taking one with a black-powder rifle in theway that the mountain men would have so many years ago. Forsomeone like me, just being here is worth the drive fromIndiana.&quot;   That weekend eight hunters from a halfdozen states hadtraveled to Mr. Williams's ranch for the same reasons as Mr.Wuertz. All but one hunted with replicas of originalpercussion or flintlock muzzleloaders, most of which they'dbuilt with their own hands. Some even walked the plains inbuckskin clothing.   Other groups have pitched tepees and camped among thecottonwoods. Mr. Williams contributes to the realism byserving meals of buffalo around an open campfire. He and hisassistants wear dress of the period, and hunters who chooseto can hunt with one of Mr. Williams's original Sharps&quot;buffalo rifles.&quot;   No matter what the gun of choice, those who come meet withsuccess. Though an animal of surprising quickness and speed,the buffalo has never been as challenging as, say, whitetaildeer. The two hunters eventually were able to sneak withinrange in the midst of the expansive prairie. Roy English wasfirst to fire and Mr. Wuertz was quick to add a humaneinsurance shot.   But the day was far from over for Messrs. English andWuertz. They, Mr. Williams and an associate labored far intothe afternoon. When they were done they had the skin removedand readied to be made into a massive buffalo robe. Moreimportantly, the meat was trimmed and ready for the trip backto Indiana.   &quot;That's another big reason why we came,&quot; said Mr. English.&quot;We're going to be taking home meat and you can bet we'regoing to use it all.&quot;   The two hunters will not only be eating a lot, they'llalso be eating well. According to Mr. Williams, thethree-year-old bull will produce close to 500 pounds ofsuperbly delicious meat. As an added bonus, it's a meat thatthe hunters can feast on to their heart's content. &quot;Buffalois a meat that's high in protein but very lean,&quot; said Mr.Williams. &quot;It's not zero-percent cholesterol, but it's muchless than beef. It's a very healthy meat.&quot;   ---   Mr. Pearce is a free-lance writer in Manhattan, Kan.</TEXT></DOC>
