(editorial)andM;</TITLE><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Third-party input could enhance system softwareandM;In its 11 years, Apple has worn its pride like an emblem of superiority andused it to carve out a piece of the market.andP;  The company should be proud ofits role in creating the personal computer and setting lofty standards forthe industry as a whole.andM;But Apple's pride also has an unseemly side, a kind of conceit that, some Macdevelopers say, impedes the development of the Macintosh.andM;According to these critics, Apple is afflicted with a malady that's all toocommon in the computer industry, the NIH (Not Invented Here) syndrome.andP;  Inother words, if we didn't invent it, we don't want it.andM;While not unique to Apple's culture, and in fact typical of most corporationsthat suffer a heavy dose of insecurity and a surplus of egotism, the NIHsyndrome tends to stifle innovation by deterring companies from acquiring keyproducts or technologies from outside developers.andM;In Apple's case, this insularity is not pervasive.andP;  Strategic investments byApple in connectivity products from companies like Touch Communications andSybase and outright purchases of Network Innovations and Orion NetworkSystems belie the NIH tag, and Apple did buy some code last year fromex-employee Andy Hertzfeld to speed up color QuickDraw.andM;But in the area of system software, the core code underlying many of thefundamental innovations of the machine, the grousing Mac developers areright.andP;  Apple's NIH attitude is a critical reason why Macintosh systemsoftware has improved only incrementally in the past five years.andM;While the Mac's system software languishes, third-party vendors have beendelivering products that make up for many of the system deficiencies.andP;  FifthGeneration's Suitcase and ALSoft's Master Juggler, for example, allow formore than 15 desk accessories in the System file.andP;  CE Software's QuicKeys andDiskTop provide macro functions and file management functions, respectively.andM;Silicon Beach Software's SuperCard, due out later this year, provides anumber of significant enhancements to HyperCard, which is, of course, bundledwith the Mac.andM;Other companies have core technologies that could help Apple bring outlinefonts, interprocess communications, sophisticated text handling and soundcapabilities to users as part of the system much sooner than if Applepracticed its NIH policy.andM;Apple's mandate for system software is to provide consistency, quality and ahigh level of functionality.andP;  Users shouldn't have to look to third-partydevelopers -- and pay extra in the process -- for fundamental features tomake up for Apple's sluggish development process.andM;They wouldn't have to if Apple were to move away from the NIH mind-set in1989.andP;  Innovation has been one of the cornerstones of Apple since itsinception, a source of well-earned pride; now, rather than trying to reinventthe wheel, Apple should look toward purchasing more of the wheels it needs tokeep the Mac roadworthy.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
