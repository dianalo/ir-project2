The Texas savings and loan said the application must be approved by federal regulators. It said it currently has regulatory net worth of $15 million, or 1.5% of liabilities, while federal regulations require it to have net worth equal to at least 3% of liabilities. It has $979.5 million in assets.    Because of its decline in net worth, First Federal also said its stock won't be quoted on the Nasdaq system, but will be quoted on the pink sheets.    First Federal has signed a letter of intent to be acquired by Prime Group, a Chicago real estate and development company, for $3.50 a share, or $7.8 million. That transaction is pending.    In addition, First Federal is protesting the Dallas home loan bank's demand that it add $63.4 million to its loan-loss reserves. </TEXT></DOC>
