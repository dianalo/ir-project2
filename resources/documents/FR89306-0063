NCHSR will use a contractorto survey a representative sample of patients with Acquired Immunity DeficiencySyndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses and the providers of servicesto these patients. The purpose of the survey will be to obtain data whichwill allow for making informed national estimates of the use, costs, andfinancing of health services for patients with AIDS and other HIV-relatedillnesses and to examine variations in resource use across geographic areas,risk groups, and stages of illness. Records will be obtained solely tosupport the congressionally-mandated responsibility for the conduct ofhealth services research activities by NCHSR. Participation in the surveysubject individuals will be strictly voluntary. The records in this system will be maintained in a secure manner compatiblewith their content and use. The contractor will be required to adhere tothe provisions of the Privacy Act and the HHS Privacy Act Regulations.The System Manager and the Contract Project Director will control accessto the data. Only contractor personnel whose duties require the use ofsuch information will have regular access to the identifiers of the recordsin this system. Records will be stored in locked files or safes, in securedareas. Computer terminals will be located in secured areas. Data storedin computers will be accessed through the use of passwords known only toauthorized contractor personnel. These passwords will be changed frequently.Names and other identifying particulars will be deleted when data fromoriginal records are encoded on data files for delivery to the Government.Once the Government has received and accepted all servies and deliverablescalled for delivery under the terms of the contract, the contractor willdestroy all individual respondent identifiers and maintain no copies. The data collection activities of NCHSR are governed by 42 U.S.C. 242m(d),section 308(d) of the PHS Act. Under this provision, information collectedwhich can be identified with an individual may not be used for any purposeother than the purpose for which it was collected, i.e., health servicesresearch, unless that individual has given specific consent for such release.No data will be used to affect the subjects individually; there will beno use of the data to make determinations about individual's rights, benefits,or privileges. NCHSR proposes to use a contractor to collect and processthe ACSUS data as NCHSR lacks the internal resources to conduct the surveyand process the data. Contracted services will include data collection,collation, analysis, and computer input. The contractor is subject to thePrivacy Act and the confidentiality provisions of 42 U.S.C. 242m(d), andHHS contract officials and the ACSUS project officer will monitor contractorcompliance. NCHSR is proposing only one routine use which will permit the disclosureof records to the Department of Justice should the Department of Healthand Human Services become a defendant in litigation in which the systemrecords could become evidence. The following notice is written in the present, rather than the futuretense, in order to avoid the unnecessary expenditure of public funds torepublish the notice after the system has become effective.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 22, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Wilford J.
