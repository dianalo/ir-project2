By cutting U.S. crops available for export, the searing water shortage in the country's midsection promises to strengthen competitors in the global food-trade war, including the European Community, Brazil, Argentina and Australia. That poses a long-term setback for U.S. farm exports, a major positive contributor to the trade balance and to the agricultural economy.    There are bright spots, of course: U.S. farm-export business so far is good, as foreign buyers rush to meet their supply needs before prices rise even more. U.S. corn stockpiles are abundant, probably enabling the U.S. to keep up with demand this year. The nation has enough grain to meet its food-aid commitments to poor nations. And soaring prices for U.S. commodities will help raise the dollar value of farm exports this year, despite likely declines in volume.    The Reagan administration remains fairly upbeat about U.S. export prospects. Thomas Kay, administrator of the Foreign Agricultural Service, said he expects rising commodity prices to boost the value of U.S. farm exports, which would help offset any loss in volume. Because world market prices will also rise, &quot;I don't think we'll be any less competitive in the long run than we are now,&quot; he said.    Nevertheless, the coming supply reduction, particularly in soybeans and wheat, seems certain to weaken the U.S. campaign to regain its dominance of world food trade. So far, U.S. farmers are mostly alone in their suffering; crops are relatively healthy in the rest of the world. That promises to raise U.S. grain and soybean prices above prevailing world levels, putting U.S. farmers at a competitive disadvantage.    While it's too early to assess the overall harm to major U.S. crops, some analysts, including John Schnittker, a Washington consultant, predict that export volume for wheat, corn and soybeans, the principal U.S. export crops, could drop 5% to 10% this year. &quot;We're talking significant rationing across the board,&quot; says Richard Loewy, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York. The drought is &quot;absolutely a setback&quot; for U.S. grain trade, he says.    An example of the potential problems arose earlier this week, when an expected subsidized sale of U.S. grain to China fell through. Trade sources said the planned sale of 500,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at about $108 a ton failed after U.S. officials realized that at current drought-elevated prices, the government would have to subsidize U.S. exporters at a rate of about $45 a ton.    Such subsidized sales have been important in the past year, especially in boosting U.S. wheat exports. But the Reagan administration seems certain to resist export subsidies in the face of high U.S. market prices, which raise government-subsidy costs. Largely as a result, some traders see U.S. wheat exports falling more than 15% this year to about 1.35 billion to 1.40 billion bushels from 1.66 billion bushels last year.    Soybean exports are likely to suffer even more. Acreage cutbacks under current U.S. farm policy, coupled with potential drought damage, are likely to mean that the U.S. produces less than half the world's soybeans this year for the first time, said an executive of a major exporter. Other major food-producing nations are likely to move quickly to take advantage of any U.S. supply shortage. Soybean production is likely to rise 10% or more this autumn in Argentina and Brazil, the nation's two chief competitors.    As a result, &quot;We will lose market share dramatically&quot; in the coming year, the executive said.    At the same time, wheat production in the European Community, Australia, Argentina and other nations is likely to soar. &quot;The EC has a wonderful crop -- big, and good quality,&quot; says Andrew Bellingham, analyst with World Perspectives Inc., a Washington consultant. &quot;They're enthused about what's happening. It will make them more able to compete . . . (and make it) more difficult for the U.S.&quot;    Recent trends in U.S. farm trade and policy had already laid the groundwork for an export setback. Ample production and U.S. export subsidies had depressed world prices, particularly for wheat, and boosted demand. Aggressive U.S. sales practices helped lift the U.S. share of world grain and soybean trade to about 48% last year from a recent low of about 37% in 1985.    But at the same time, the U.S. has cut planted acreage more than 20% under various conservation and price-support programs. That raised the prospect of shortage in the event of crop troubles.    The situation resembles 1983, when acreage cutbacks followed by a drought slashed U.S. corn production more than one-third. After that, the U.S. share of world grain trade skidded while other food-exporting nations, encouraged by rising world prices, boosted production sharply. The result was a period of overproduction, low prices and hardship for U.S. farmers.    ---   Bruce Ingersoll contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
