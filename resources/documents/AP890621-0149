The Republicans, headed by a former Waffen SS soldier, havetapped an ultraconservative vein with strong nationalistic appealsand demands to virtually bury the Nazi past.   The Republicans won 7.1 percent of the vote and six seats inSunday's balloting for the European Parliament. It was their firstnationwide test.   ``The party has automatically improved its chances for the nextelections,'' said West German pollster Wolfgang G. Gibowski.``Nothing succeeds like success.''   Gibowskia, a director of the independent Forschungsgruppe Wahlenpolling organization of Mannheim, added, ``A party that shows at thefirst shot it can get more than 5 percent of the vote will no longerbe subject to doubts among voters about whether they're wastingtheir ballot by voting for it.''   Five percent of the vote is the minimum needed for a party togain seats in the Bonn Parliament, and many people are predictingthe Republicans will succeed during national voting in December 1990.   The Republicans will receive $8.2 million in campaign fundsallotted by the government to various political parties.   Founded in 1983, the Republicans came to prominence in cityelections in January in West Berlin, gaining 7.5 percent of the voteand 11 seats in the city legislature. They ran on a platform to ridthe city of foreign workers.   Later, the Republicans picked up support in the few races wherethey fielded candidates in municipal elections in Hesse state.   Franz Schoenhuber, the former SS soldier who heads theRepublicans, told thousands of cheering supporters in February thatyoung Germans should be absolved of guilt for the Holocaust.   ``Today's young generation of Germans is no more guilty forAuschwitz than the sons and daughters of Americans who committedgenocide at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,'' Schoenhuber said.   Schoenhuber, who claims the party has 16,000 members, has alsorailed against the Common Market as a threat to West German nationalinterests and made strong law-and-order appeals that reportedly havegained support among police groups.   There have been clashes between left-wing demonstrators andpolice guarding Republican rallies.   Some critics accuse the Republicans of having neo-Nazitendencies. Federal officials have refused to call them right-wing``extremists,'' which include various neo-Nazi groups.   Heinz Galinski, the leader of West Germany's Jewish community,predicts the Republicans will win 5 percent of the vote next yearand sit in Parliament.   ``The success of the Republicans is not temporary,'' Galinski, a76-year-old survivor of Auschwitz, told The Associated Press. ``Wemust figure in the future on having a further increase in theradical right-wing.''   Since Sunday's voting for the European Parliament, one main issuehas been whether Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative ChristianDemocrats would form a coalition with the Republicans to stay inpower following the 1990 voting.   Kohl rejects the idea. Schoenhuber denies he wants to work withKohl's party but says he has had contacts in that direction from theChrisitan Democratic Party's more conservative Bavarian sisterparty, the Christian Social Union.   ``We're in the happy position of being the courted bride and notthe flirtatious bridegroom,'' Schoenhuber said Monday in summing uphis view of where the party stands.   Republican leaders also have announced they plan to move theparty headquarters from Munich to Bonn to increase their profile,while saying they will run in numerous state and local races beforethe 1990 national voting.   Among the leftist politicians worried by the Republicans' highprofile is Gerhard Schroeder, head of the opposition SocialDemocratic Party in the Lower Saxony state parliament.   He blamed Kohl's party for reviving hopes for the reunificationof West Germany and East Germany, especially during the recent visitof Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. That, according toSchroeder, fueled the Republicans' own strident demands forreunification.   ``That is an appeal to national feelings that has nothing to dowith reality,'' Schroeder said. ``That's a chance for theRepublicans. They thrive on that hope.''   Schroeder has called for a united front involving politicalparties, churches and labor unions to carry out a campaign to haltthe Republicans. He wants to target young people in particular toeducate them about the ultra-right.</TEXT></DOC>
