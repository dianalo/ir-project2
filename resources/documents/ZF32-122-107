 Attendance was up to 70,000 people, andthere were more exhibitors than last year (about 700).andP;  Considering thatComdex took place only six weeks ago, the health of PC Expo is a sign thatthe computer industry can still sustain more shows than any reasonable personwould expect.andM;The Windows exhibits seemed to cover half of the main hall.andP;  It didn't seemto matter much where the so-called &quot;Windows Pavilion&quot; started or stopped,since everyone in the computer business seems to be producing or planning aWindows product.andP;  This applies to Macintosh, Unix, and IBM mainframedevelopers as well as those with DOS products.andM;The Corel booth should win the prize for the sheer energy of their marketingstrategy.andP;  They are increasing the power of their art product; moving tomultiple platforms; releasing a CD-ROM version; and holding a million-dollarcontest for art created on CorelDRAW.andP;  Their large presentation area wasstanding room only almost continuously.andP;  But the thing that impressed me mostwas the announcement of a bug fix.andP;  I have become accustomed to companiessidestepping bug fixes by pretending that there were never any bugs to beginwith.andP;  But Corel was outright proud to be addressing the needs of customers.andM;Multi-platform strategiesandM;As the massive success of Windows 3.0 sends shocks through the PC industry,there is more and more priority given to cross-platform development.andM;The trend to support multiple operating systems was very evident at the show.andO;Here are some examples:andM;DOS to Windows: WordStar International plans to use Windows as the road totheir successful future.andP;  WordStar already has their Legacy Windows wordprocessor, but it is isolated from the traditional WordStar interface.andP;  Theyplan to upgrade their entire product line so the DOS product gets more of aWindows look and the Windows product retains the famous WordStar hotkeyinterface.andM;I walked away impressed at the painstaking attention they are paying to theelegance of their graphical user interface.andP;  The development team seemskeenly aware that people are moving to Windows for a consistent and moreintuitive way to interact with the computer.andP;  I would be surprised if theyare not serious contenders within a year.andM;Macintosh to Windows: M.Y.O.B, the prize winning small business accountingpackage for the Macintosh, has been released in a Windows version.andM;Dynodex, a powerful and elegant Address Book manager on the Macintosh waspreviewing as a Windows version.andP;  I asked Director of Sales Bob Kinnin if hewas worried about rumors that the Windows market is smaller than originallyanticipated.andP;  He said that whatever the numbers are, they expect to do quitewell.andP;  The target audience for their address book product is &quot;almost anyone&quot;so they don't feel any special concern over the numbers game.andM;Mainframe to Windows: Information Builders' FOCUS/EIS is for the quickdevelopment of Windows-based executive information systems.andP;  It is one of themost intuitive and powerful Windows front end builders I have seen yet.andO;FOCUS/EIS combines the power of a Windows front end builder with the depthand maturity of an existing database development language.andM;Computer Associates is also developing interfaces for its mainframe productson Windows stations as well as developing a line of Windows software.andM;Tools for cross platform development are also available.andP;  One of the mostestablished is Digitalk's Smalltalk V which is available for Windows as wellas DOS, Presentation Manager, and the Macintosh.andM;One surprise was the existence of another Basic language for Windows.andP;  Thisone is from GFA,the multinational giant based in Germany.andP;  GFA-Basic is oneof the top selling languages in Europe.andP;  Already established as a crossplatform GUI builder (used extensively for the popular Commodore and Amigainterfaces there), GFA is hoping to establish inroads in the US market.andM;Windows shows proliferateandM;With new Windows events appearing monthly, some of America's biggestpromoters are repositioning their Windows shows to stake out mind share.andM;CM Ventures, promoters of the semiannual Windows andamp; OS/2 Conferences, isstressing its corporate end-user focus.andP;  The Windows World event fromMicrosoft and the Interface Group is known as a reseller event.andP;  And thenewest show, IDG's PC Windows Exposition, is selling itself as a show for therest of us.andM;Microsoft continues to promote events on its own.andP;  It is in the midst of a24-city Discovery Days fair for entry level end users (see &quot;Marketing Watch,&quot;this issue).andP;  Corporate users, meanwhile, will be served by Microsoft'sDevelopers' Tools Forum, a week-long event August 25-29 in Seattle featuringhow-to sessions on Microsoft's C, Basic, and macro languages.andP;  Third-partydevelopers can attend free &quot;Behind Windows&quot; briefings in nine major cities inJuly and early August.andP;  Developers can also attend a $445 technicalconference on version 3.1 scheduled for August 12 and 13 in Seattle.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
