DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former Wedtech Corp. official says theex-chairman of the scandal-plagued defense contractor oncesuggested killing another official insured by the company for $15million.   But Lawrence Shorten, testifying Monday at the racketeeringtrial of Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., and six others, said he nevertook the suggested murder plot seriously.   Shorten, once Wedtech's chief financial officer, is one of fourformer company officials to plead guilty to state and federalcharges, and was the second to testify at the trial in exchange forleniency.   Biaggi, Wedtech founder John Mariotta and five others areaccused of turning Wedtech, now in bankruptcy proceedings, into aracketeering enterprise that made millions of dollars in payoffs tosecure government contracts.   Under cross-examination by the defense, Shorten admitted thatafter he and other Wedtech executives forced Mariotta out of thecompany in 1985, they kept paying premiums for a $15 millioninsurance policy on Mariotta despite Wedtech's financial problems.   Shorten, however, denied that another Wedtech executive, AnthonyGuariglia, wanted to keep up the policy ``because it might come inhandy.''   ``But he did say that if John Mariotta died the company coulduse the $15 million?'' pressed Mariotta attorney Jeffrey Glekel.   ``He did make that statement, yes,'' said Shorten.   The witness said Guariglia called him in late 1985 to talk abouta conversation with then-Wedtech Chairman Fred Neuberger.   ``I think he said to the effect, `Wait till you hear this one.'I said `What?' He said, `Freddie came up with the bright idea toknock off John Mariotta.'   ``I said to him: You are not serious?' He says, `No, I justthought you'd want to know that Freddie made that statement.'''   Guariglia and Neuberger are expected to testify for thegovernment.   The defense has been trying to depict them and other formerWedtech officials as liars and thieves who have admitted crimes farmore serious than the ones Biaggi and his co-defendants are accusedof.   Mario Moreno, another one of the four cooperating Wedtechofficials, testified earlier that Neuberger suggested hiring anIsraeli hitman to kill Mariotta.   Shorten said Neuberger often boasted of having connections withan Israeli hitman.   ``He said he could take care of everything, he could hire a`consultant from Israel,' but it had nothing to do with JohnMariotta. It was more joking than anything else,'' said Shorten.   Shorten said later that local Teamsters officials suggestedkilling Mariotta in March 1986.   ``They said it could be done for $50,000,'' said Shorten. ``Werejected it out of hand, that it was a crazy thought, that wewouldn't get involved in anything like that.''   Moreno has testified that Wedtech paid off Teamsters officialsfor labor peace and that a union leader offered to ``eliminate''Mariotta because they were afraid he might ``spill the beans'' onthe payoffs.   Moreno also testified that most of the executives rejected theidea, although he said Neuberger complained they were acting like``Boy Scouts.''</TEXT></DOC>
