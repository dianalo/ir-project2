To be sure, the markets are far from convinced that the U.S. deficit no longer poses a problem. By the same token, though Japan's trade surplus has been steadily narrowing over the past year, analysts question whether the rate of shrinkage can be sustained.    Nevertheless, the clear recent improvements in the trading performances of the industrialized world's two biggest economies has focused attention on the laggard showing of Western Europe's economic powerhouse. Though Germany earlier this week announced a slight contraction in its merchandise-trade surplus for February -- to 8.2 billion marks ($4.86 billion) from 8.5 billion marks in January -- the figures appear basically stuck at levels that are unacceptable to its trading partners.    Thus, starting at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's annual meeting of ministers here today and tomorrow and moving to next month's seven-nation economic summit in Toronto, prescriptions for increasing world growth will inevitably center on Bonn.    Despite all this, &quot;German-bashing,&quot; by the Americans at least, is likely to be more muted than in recent years. A combination of circumstances and frustration that earlier criticisms produced so few results explains why. Because most of Germany's trade is with Europe anyway, even a rapid fall in Germany's trade surplus would help the U.S. trade deficit only indirectly.    Nonetheless, Germany's record stands in stark contrast to Japan's. The Japanese trade deficit has declined in each of the past 12 months, and it has declined for what American officials consider the right reasons. Japan is undergoing a major change in spending habits, with Japanese buying more at home and selling less abroad. Japanese exports to the U.S. in April, for instance, dropped a little to $7.34 billion, while exports to Japan soared 40%, to $3.21 billion. The Japanese economy in general is booming.    German officials plead that they have indeed done some of the things the U.S. has asked them to, such as lowering their interest rates and cutting income taxes (though not as quickly as Washington would like). While this has produced only feeble growth of 1.7% last year and perhaps a little over 2% this year, the officials argue they can't inject any further economic stimulus without touching off the inflation that Germans fear so intensely. Germany is already running a budget deficit, equivalent to 3.5% of its gross national product, a higher proportion than in the U.S.    &quot;The Germans have a very difficult, perhaps insurmountable, political problem,&quot; says a senior OECD official. &quot;The things they spend their government money on, the things their consumers buy, and how they raise their government revenues are very different from those things in Japan.&quot; For example, while major new roads, bridges and airports are being built in Japan, the transportation system is essentially finished in Germany.    German consumers are also more sated than their Japanese counterparts. &quot;What are we supposed to buy?&quot; asks a German banker. &quot;We've got a nice house, two cars and a VCR already.&quot;    While much of the world points to a still-stubborn 8% unemployment rate, and argues that providing jobs for these 2.2 million Germans would create a new consumer demand, German officials insist that flooding the economy with money won't necessarily create jobs. Concedes an international monetary official: &quot;The Germans don't have much room for maneuver.&quot;    International policy makers are trying a new tactic: touting small-scale, microeconomic changes, code-named &quot;structural adjustment,&quot; to free up parts of the European, and especially German economy by extending the hours shops can remain open, by making it easier for businesses to hire and fire workers, by making credit cards more available. Much of this will be speeded by the demolition of most inter-European trade barriers by 1992, but Germany, in particular has a lot to adapt to.    &quot;We are advising such adjustments as cutting government subsidies to farming and ailing industries,&quot; says the OECD official. &quot;This is a question of political will, not of the size of budget deficits or trade surpluses.&quot; He adds: &quot;We are urging it on all of Europe, because we're more likely to get Germany to cooperate in the European context than by haranguing them alone.&quot;    Says a senior U.S. official: &quot;The Germans keep telling us they simply can't do any more in the short term and there are many people in the administration who think they might be right.&quot; He adds: &quot;And there are many others who are so tired of yelling at them that they've just given up.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
