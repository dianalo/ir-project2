The reduction in price risk is expected to more than offset the coupon risk facing the investors and thereby stimulate the demand for these long-term bonds. Mr. Bryan's analysis of the problem appears incomplete. Viewing the bonds from the issuer's perspective leads to interesting conclusions.    The coupon on floating-rate T-bonds is proposed to be tied to the T-bill rates. An increase in the T-bill rates will lead to a corresponding increase in the T-bond rates as the spread between the rates will be fixed. Consequently, a high level of T-bill rates will lead to an increase of the government's debt service obligations across the board. Budget balancing, political pressures or simply prudent management will dictate that the Treasury constrain the interest expense. With the prevailing fixed-rate bonds, such interest expense constraints provide a check on the growth of national debt. The proposed floating-rate financing gives no incentive to restrain the issuance of new debt as the floating-interest rates potentially remain under the Treasury's control.    Lalatendu Misra   Assistant Professor of Finance    College of Business   University of Texas   San Antonio, Texas   ---   Mr. Bryan made a good case for issuing floating-rate Treasuries in order to reduce the interest cost on the national debt. However, the assertion that this change would lower the interest rate on corporate bonds and residential mortgages wasn't based on sound reasoning.    He makes the implicit assumption that the public will shift its holdings of debt from short-term Treasury bills to floating-rate Treasury bonds, resulting in a flatter yield curve. However, it is entirely possible that the public will shift from corporate bonds or residential mortgages, resulting in higher rates on these securities. Even if investors did switch from T-bills to floating T-bonds, resulting in lower floating T-bonds rates, investors would continue to calculate rates for fixed-rate corporate debt by calculating a risk premium on existing fixed-rate Treasuries.    It's very unlikely that a switch to floating-rate Treasuries will lower corporate bond or residential interest rates, and it's possible that these rates could rise if the public substitutes private long-term debt for floating-rate Treasuries. There are no magical ways to lower interest rates. If the government wants to lower borrowing costs of the nation's businesses and homeowners, it will have to cut the deficit and provide incentives for the American people to save.    J.D.
