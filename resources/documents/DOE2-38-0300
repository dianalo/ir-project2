Thenotion of heat flow during solidification, of nucleation processes, ofthe crystal growth mechanisms, as well as formation of crystal-melt interfaceand crystallization of different phases, is given. Ingot formation, meltflow, defect formation in the ingot are also considered. Problems ofingot solidification in the process of alloy continuous casting and weldingbath solidification are elucidated. Methods permitting to control crystallizationprocesses so as to produce the structures required are described. 269refs.; 45 figs.; 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
