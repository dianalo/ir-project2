Most recently, Sandinista police beat and arrested 39 organizers of a previously approved demonstration in the town of Nandaime. Sandinista justice then sentenced the demonstrators without trial to six months in prison. The civic opposition leaders were subsequently charged as &quot;delinquents&quot; against the state, which could bring them six years in prison. We now have learned that one of the protesters -- ironically named Alejandro Sandino -- has died in prison. The Sandinistas say he died of a heart attack. His family claims he was murdered. Another prisoner, Miriam Arguello, who is a lawyer and was the main speaker at the Nandaime rally is also reported to be sick. An amendment to the Contra bill should demand a medical inspection of these detainees. </TEXT></DOC>
