Such maneuvers have long appealed to some U.S. investors and Wall Street brokers. But lately, it's Japanese life insurance companies that are showing a particular zeal for pursuing dividend stocks.    Yesterday, for example, Security Pacific topped the Big Board actives list with more than 5.5 million shares changing hands. The lure: the stock carries a 5.9% yield and will begin trading ex-dividend today. More than 65.9 million shares of Southern Co. were traded Monday, the day before that stock, with a 9.1% annual yield, went ex-dividend.    In addition to Southern Co., investors Monday also went after Chase Manhattan, Pinnacle West Capital, Eastern Utilities Associates and Cincinnati Gas andamp; Electric. Trading in these five issues accounted for nearly 41% of the 275.3 million shares that traded on the New York Stock Exchange that day.    This activity &quot;makes the public believe that there is a lot of trading going on,&quot; says Kenneth Ducey, a vice president at S.G. Warburg andamp; Co. in New York.    Wall Street pros, however, perceive most dividend-related trading as a mirage. Some Japanese investors own the stocks for 10 minutes or less, and just want to appear as holders of record on the right day to finesse certain Japanese accounting rules. Such trades &quot;absolutely&quot; foul up market volume figures, and make the stock trading look much more vigorous than it really is, says John Havens, a Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. trader.    Here's what the Japanese are up to:   Japan's top life insurance companies have big capital gains in their investment portfolios, as well as plenty of policyholders who are pledged 7% or better returns on their full-life insurance policies. Trouble is, under Japanese accounting rules, those capital gains can't readily be paid out to policyholders. Only dividends and interest income can be.    So the Japanese insurers want dividends. Quickly and with as little fuss as possible.    Enter handy stocks like Security Pacific -- with a yield far higher than what's available in Japan. &quot;In accounting terms, we can get some dividend income&quot; by buying such stocks just before the dividend is paid, says Katsutoshi Oki, a portfolio manager at Nippon Life Insurance Co. Mr. Oki says his company doesn't do such trading much, but traders say Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. and Dai-Ichi Mutual are among the leaders.    In fact, Japanese insurers can sell the stock just minutes after they buy it, but have the trade settled after the stock goes ex-dividend. That way, they need hardly worry about the stock price fluctuating during their oh-so-brief ownership period. And that creates the odd spectacle of the same block of a high-dividend stock changing hands over and over, so each Japanese insurer can claim the dividend for itself.    That explains why so many shares can reportedly trade without moving the price much. Security Pacific barely budged yesterday, and the day before, Southern Co. climbed all of 1/4 to 24 1/4, in a rising market.    &quot;These aren't real trades,&quot; carps a block trader at a major Wall Street firm. The Japanese jump in and out of stocks so fast that their money really isn't at risk, he explains. What's more, commissions on such trades often run only one cent a share, he says, compared with six or seven cents a share on regular trades.    Come March 31, Japan's ravenous appetite for high-yield stocks may calm down. The Ministry of Finance in Tokyo is expected to issue new guidelines for insurance companies that may let them pass on more capital gains directly to policyholders, ending the need for dividend-capture shenanigans. But &quot;it could take until September or March 1989&quot; for new rules to sink in, says Nippon Life's Mr. Oki. &quot;It's complicated.&quot;    In addition to Japanese investors, dividend-capture strategies appeal to U.S. corporations, because 70% of the dividend income they collect is tax-free. But unlike the quick-trading Japanese, the U.S. corporate investors must hold the shares for 46 days to qualify for the tax break.    Some corporate investors buy a basket of utility or preferred stocks and hedge it by selling a basket of similar issues. Since utility and preferred issues generally all move in tandem, this technique should guard a portfolio against a market drop.    Before the crash, some investors would sell call options to hedge against any losses in the stocks during the required 46-day holding period. However, the strategy backfired in October, when stocks fell so sharply that premiums from the sale of the options didn't provide sufficient protection.    Some brokerage and money management firms go after stocks that pay a big dividend and offer a discount when the quarterly payouts are reinvested in the company's stock. They buy and sell the stocks quickly, in the same way the Japanese insurance companies do.    Among recent dividend plays, Chase Manhattan, Southern Co. and Eastern Utilities offer a 5% discount when dividends are used to buy their stocks.    Reactions are mixed among companies whose stocks figure in various dividend ploys. &quot;The volume grows dramatically, especially with the Japanese in the picture. But there's no cause for alarm,&quot; says Michael Noel, treasurer at Southern California Edison.    Other companies aren't so serene. A trader at one brokerage firm recalls a frantic call from an executive worried about the sudden spike of trading in his company's stock. His fear: it might signal that an unfriendly buyer was accumulating a large stake.    &quot;If he believed someone was accumulating a block of stock without moving the price,&quot; says the trader, &quot;then maybe the company should be taken over.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
