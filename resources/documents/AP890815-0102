Well, that _ if their justice system goes forward and there isa _ there is an indictment against him, I would be remiss if Ididn't try to see him brought to trial.   Q. Well, sir, can't you take the lead in that and encourage theJustice Department to proceed?   A. I've put it just exactly the way I want to put it.   Q. Mr. President _   A. We've got to get to the back of the room here.   We're _ yeah?   Q. Can you explain why you have not retaliated for the murder ofColonel Higgins?   A. Retaliated for his murder?   Q. Yes, sir.   A. If I could find some action _ diplomatic, military, privatesector, public sector _ that I thought would help get the hostagesout or guard against future hostage taking, I would take such action.   Military action _ I'd like to know that what action we took wasnot going to victimize a lot of innocent people.   And I'd like to be sure of all the facts before taking action onthe Higgins case.   And I wish I could tell you we had all the facts, and we don't.   So, when you _ when you look at the action that the United Statescan take, I don't want to _ I don't want to be responsible for theloss of innocent life.   I also must _ would have to weigh, if we considered militaryaction, the lives of the Americans that were being asked to carryout that action.   So, it's just not clear yet, but if I could find a way to takethose hostages, get them and bring them out, and that required usingthe military force of the United States, make no mistake about it, Iwould do it in an instant.   Yeah? Right in the back. You have a follow-up?   Q. Yes. May I ask what you're doing to increase the intelligencethat would let you do something like that? Have you ordered the CIAto try to get assets in Lebanon?   A. Well, the problem there is it takes a long time.   And I do think that the period that we went through quite a fewyears ago has resulted in less human intelligence than is necessaryto come to grips with something as murky as hostage-holding.   And so I'd like to do more, and the various agencies know of myinterest in this, but I don't want to hold out the wrong kind ofhope that you can say, ``let's get more agents, more intelligence ofthe human source'' and that that happens overnight.   It just doesn't work that way.   Yeah, way in the middle in the back, yes?</TEXT><HEAD>MORE</HEAD></DOC>
