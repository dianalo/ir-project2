A subscriber to Sullivan's Chartist newsletter, her wealth hadincreased 45 percent on the year and she stopped to give Sullivan a dozenflowers. Never in his two decades in the investment business had Sullivan beenso rewarded.;   After she left, Sullivan told his staff, &quot;If ever there was asign of a market top, this is it.&quot;;   When profits come so easy, stock market&quot;corrections&quot; -- as they are known on Wall Street -- occur to bring stocksback down from their lofty heights. And a correction is what many moneymanagers are calling this recent stock downturn.;   &quot;I'd call it a correctionbecause I can see things turning up,&quot; said Vin Bajakian, manager of theVanguard Wellington Fund.;   In a correction, markets retrace some of thegains they've built as a way to make up for mistakes some overzealousinvestors have made. In a bear market, stocks fall in value for an extendedperiod -- an event that hasn't happened in a major way since the early 1980s.;  &quot;The market has a life of its own and it will do what it wants to,&quot; Bajakiansays. &quot;We can take a rational view of it only after the fact.&quot;;   Before the1980s, corrections often took weeks or months to put overheated stocks intheir place. They are part of the normal ebb and flow of investment ideas inthe stock market. When too many people get nervous, prices usually fall to alevel where new buyers are more comfortable.;   But today, these moves cantake place in days -- or in a matter of hours, as occurred late last Fridayafternoon. And few investment experts were surprised at the recent push tolower stock prices.;   &quot;Corrections today tend to be violent and quick,&quot; saidMike DiCarlo, who runs the John Hancock Special Equities Fund in Boston. &quot;It'snot like investors haven't had a pretty good year already.&quot;;   In the lastyear, investors have made tremendous profits in some of the market's riskiestareas.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Orange County Register  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911122  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  371  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, November 22, 199100327069,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
