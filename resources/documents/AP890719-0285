Britain's BAT Industries PLC, which swallowed up Farmers lessthan a year ago after another hostile battle, last week became thetarget of an investment group headed by takeover strategist SirJames Goldsmith.   That group has said it will sell the Los Angeles-based insurancegiant if its $21 billion takeover proposal succeeds.   Insurance regulators in the nine states where Farmers operatesare not saying whether they will oppose the new bid. But theproposal appears likely to face the same regulatory hurdles thatslowed BAT's takeover last year.   ``A major issue here is: Should insurance companies be subject tothese types of takeovers?'' asked Ted Kulongoski, director of theOregon Department of Insurance and Finance. Kulongoski has final sayover the Goldsmith group's application to take over Farmers in hisstate.   ``When you have a product that is such an integral part ofsociety, that the government mandates, should it be subject totakeovers that can load debt on the company and pass it off to theconsumer?'' Kulongoski said.   Oregon, Washington and Idaho regulators initially opposed BAT'stakeover of Farmers last year, giving in only after the hostile bidwas replaced by a friendly merger agreement.   California regulators also rejected the merger, but that decisionwas overturned by a state court.   The Goldsmith proposal faces reviews by regulators in thosestates, along with regulators in Ohio, Texas, Illinois, Arizona andKansas.   ``We all didn't know we were having a dress rehearsal for thissummer's production,'' Ed Southon, deputy state insurancecommissioner in Washington, said of the new bid.   ``We haven't taken a position for or against,'' Southon said.``But if it is decided that this is a hostile takeover, we willprobably handle it the same way we did last year _ by opposing it.''   In California, where the insurance company is based and doesabout 40 percent of its business, state Department of Insuranceofficials complained that the acquisition application the Goldsmithgroup filed was incomplete.   ``We now have to review the application and will not comment onit until the 60-day review process is up,'' said department attorneyLorraine Johnson.   Ms. Johnson said the application, received last week, would notbe reviewed until it was considered ``substantially complete.'' Shedeclined to elaborate.   Goldsmith's investment group made its $21.5 billion bid on July11, saying BAT's strategy of diversifying into financial serviceshad failed. Goldsmith said that if the takeover succeeds, he wouldsell the group's non-tobacco businesses, including Farmers, to paytakeover costs.   Farmers has about $11 billion in assets, most in the insurancebusiness. It ranks third in home and auto insurance behind StateFarm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. and Sears, Roebuck and Co.'sAllstate unit, and is the nation's seventh-largest property andcasualty insurance company.   Insurance analyst Gerald Lewinsohn of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. Inc. inNew York said he didn't know of any case in which state regulatorseffectively blocked the takeover of an insurance company. ``But theysure can drag things out for a long time with hearings,'' he said.   ``If you review the battle by Farmers last year, you can see whatcan happen. Each state held hearings,'' he said.   Farmers initially resisted the merger last year with BAT, theworld's largest tobacco company, suggesting BAT had suppressedresearch pointing to the dangers of smoking.   State regulators also expressed concern that BAT would dropFarmers' special discounts for non-smokers. The company owns themaker of Kool and Viceroy cigarettes, among others.   Farmers also persuaded numerous state and national lawmakers toattack BAT because it has operations in racially segregated SouthAfrica.   The initial resistance paid off for the insurance company and itsshareholders. After an acrimonious battle, Farmers in August 1988agreed to a $5.2 billion cash acquisition at a price $15 per sharehigher than the initial $4.2 billion offer of January 1988.   Farmers spokesman Jeffrey C. Beyer declined to discuss theGoldsmith offer, referring all questions to Batus, BAT's U.S.subsidiary in Louisville, Ky. Batus spokesman Wyatt Wilson alsodeclined comment.   BAT's board of directors has said it considers the proposed offerunwelcome and voted to reject it.</TEXT></DOC>
