The Senate adopted a compromise package of bills providing antitrust agencies with more information and more time to decide the impact of such transactions, while eliminating some current restrictions against directors' serving on the boards of competing companies.    The measure, which cleared the Senate Friday with little debate and hardly any controversy, is bound to prompt increased pressure by consumer and business groups on the House Judiciary Committee to schedule additional hearings and focus on the issue, according to congressional aides.    But Rep. Peter Rodino (D., N.J.), the committee's chairman, has moved cautiously in pushing legislation in this area. His version of the antitrust package includes a controversial provision requiring a detailed economic-impact statement for many large mergers and takeovers. That idea is strongly opposed by some business groups as well as by many lawmakers.    Some lawmakers believe Rep. Rodino's bill may falter in the House unless it's modified, and they question whether there is enough time left to fashion an alternative measure this year.    The Judiciary Committee hasn't scheduled any drafting sessions. Still, one congressional aide predicted that the Senate action will prompt increased attention to the issue in the House.    The Senate measure, among other things, aims to plug loopholes in antitrust statutes allowing many partnerships to begin takeover bids without first notifying the government under the Hart-Scott-Rodino law. The proposal has broad bipartisan support among lawmakers, and also has been embraced by many of the capital's most influential business lobbyists.    Partly in response to congressional urgings, the Federal Trade Commission already has issued regulations intended to eliminate many of the same loopholes.    But the Senate package goes further by requiring both controlling partners and general partners to file under the Hart-Scott-Rodino law. The FTC regulations deal only with controlling partners who would received 50% or more of the partnership's profit. Although he supported the overall measure, Sen. Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.) asserted that this language could cause confusion, unnecessary paperwork and &quot;is likely to result in the required reporting of competitively insignificant transactions.&quot;    The Senate bill also would exempt some smaller acquisitions from the pre-merger filing requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino law. In most cases, any company acquiring more than $20 million in stock or other assets of another company would have to notify the government in advance. The reporting limit for individuals proposing to make such purchases was raised to $15 million in assets of the acquiring individual. The current limits are $15 million and $10 million, respectively.    And for especially complex or controversial mergers, the bill would allow federal antitrust enforcers to ask a court for as many as 45 extra days in which to complete a review of the antitrust consequences of such transactions.    The Senate measure also would prohibit competing companies with net worth of more than $10 million from sharing directors. The current cutoff is $1 million. In addition, the bill would adjust the limit in future years to changes in the Gross National Product, the total value of the nation's output of goods and services. </TEXT></DOC>
