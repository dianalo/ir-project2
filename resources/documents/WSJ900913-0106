With fraud and other abuses by financial advisers on therise, say regulators, it's more important than ever forinvestors to check the background of their broker or planner.A history of disciplinary actions, or discrepancies in anadviser's credentials, can be a tipoff to potential trouble.</LP><TEXT>   One of the first things investors can do to check out afinancial adviser is to call their state securitiesdepartment. (Investors can get local numbers by calling theNorth American Securities Administrators Association inWashington, D.C., at 202-737-0900.)   When you call the state securities department, employeesthere can enter the name of an individual or firm into a50-state computer data base maintained jointly by the NorthAmerican Securities Administrators Association and theNational Association of Securities Dealers.   The system, called CRD, for Central RegistrationDepository, keeps track of anyone registered to sellsecurities in any state. It maintains records on anindividual's education and former employment. It also showswhether he or she has ever filed for bankruptcy; been thesubject of a complaint by state or federal regulators or thesubject of a legal injunction against doing business, or beenconvicted of or pleaded guilty to investment-relatedmisdemeanors or felonies.   If a broker or financial planner is not listed in the database at all, &quot;you've got a problem,&quot; says John Perkins, theMissouri commissioner of securities. It could mean they arenot registered to sell securities.   But, in some circumstances, a person or firm may have alegitimate reason for not registering. This would includeanyone who doesn't sell investments (such as financialplanners who accept only fees and don't sell investmentproducts -- a group that comprises about 10% of all financialplanners). Firms that sell commodities, including foreigncurrencies, may also be absent from CRD, since they are notrequired to register under the securities laws of moststates.   If the CRD computer draws a blank, investors should askthe firm or person for references from such sources as tradeassociations and banks with which they do business. They canalso ask securities regulators for help in identifying otheravenues to investigate, says Missouri's Mr. Perkins.   However, even if a person or firm is registered, and hasno negative information filed, the investor's job isn't done.Says Mark Maddox, Indiana commissioner of securities: &quot;Simplybecause a company is properly registered and has nodisciplinary action doesn't mean a lot these days.&quot;   For example, sometimes the information supplied toinvestors by state securities departments from the CRD systemisn't always complete or accurate. Recently, a reporterphoned state securities regulators in four states. She askedif any negative information existed on a brokerage firm thathad, in fact, been barred from doing business in at least onestate. One state employee said the company wasn't listed inthe CRD system, while two others said the company was listedbut had no disciplinary history.   Also, the securities industry is resisting efforts byregulators to require that brokers and other advisersdisclose information about pending legal actions againstthem.   Because of such limitations, investors may have to makeother inquiries. But other resources may not be much better.For example, Financial Planning Resource Foundation Inc., anonprofit firm in Holland, Pa., claims to have a data base on&quot;problem&quot; financial planners that is &quot;infinitely better&quot; thanthe ones operated by the states, since it pools informationthe states generate with information from &quot;law enforcementagencies and investigating bodies&quot; in the fields ofaccounting, banking, insurance and securities.   But when asked how the database gets its information, itsfounder, financial planner William Knegendorf, says thatfinancial planners around the country &quot;mail innewsclippings.&quot; He says the system has no computer ties toany regulatory group, and so far follows only 35 statesclosely. (A recent call to Financial Planning Resource's 900number, to inquire about a firm that has been included in thestates' CRD system since last spring, drew a blank.) &quot;Wedon't claim to be perfect,&quot; says Mr. Knegendorf.   Investors who aren't satisfied with the databases at theirdisposal, however, can often find out a lot on their own. Oneof the best places to start is by checking the references andcredentials of one's financial adviser.   That's what 83-year-old Florida investor Hobart C. Reiddid. Last June, he says, a broker with Group America, anAgoura Hills, Calif., firm that sells commodities over thephone, persuaded him to invest $30,000 in Swiss francs andDeutsche marks.   But after he invested, Mr. Reid, a retired graphic artist,had second thoughts. He called Delaware Trust, the bank hisbroker said was holding the currencies. When bank officialstold him they did no business with Group America, Mr. Reidsays he called his broker at Group America, who told him thata &quot;mistake&quot; had been made. Mr. Reid then received a documentthat indicated that his investment was being held by MerrillLynch andamp; Co.   Mr. Reid says he felt reassured by this, but decided tocheck with Merrill Lynch anyway. He gave the document hereceived to a Merrill Lynch broker, who forwarded it tointernal investigators in New York. Merrill says it foundthat Group America did not have a connection to Merrill.   Mr. Reid says he then got a call from Bill Whitely, GroupAmerica's president. &quot;They said would I be satisfied if I gotmy money back. I said heck yes. They sent it FederalExpress.&quot;   Mr. Whitely of Group America says that the reference toMerrill Lynch on the statement sent to Mr. Reid was acomputer mistake.   Regulators say Mr. Reid's investigatory tenacity may havehelped him in his getting his money back. &quot;Squeaky wheels --they pay off,&quot; says Bill McDonald, assistant commissioner ofthe California Department of Corporations. Still, he adds,referring to Mr. Reid, it's better if investors do thecheckups before they invest.</TEXT></DOC>
