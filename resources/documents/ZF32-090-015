 As we entered the 1990s, firmssuch as Compaq Computer, AST Research, and Zenith blindly continued to treatIBM as their primary competition and focused on the care and feeding of theirdistribution channels rather than the requirements of their customer base.andM;It took an overly aggressive (and successful) advertising campaign by DellComputer to clue the &quot;brand-name&quot; PC manufacturers in as to what was reallyhappening on the street.andP;  Although firms like Compaq had relatively solidproduct lines, their support and pricing policies were clearly antediluvian.andO;Dell's advertisements were right for Compaq's jugular, implying that all yougot by opting for the high-priced spread was an empty Brooks Brothers suitand a decidely emptier wallet.andM;Dell may have been playing hardball with its ads, but they were fundamentallyon the mark.andP;  In the spring of 1991, after months of watching their share ofthe PC market slide into the direct sales abyss, Compaq and othermanufacturers dramatically slashed the prices of their computers across theboard.andP;  Things heated up even more quickly in the highly competitive notebookarena.andP;  Faced with the prospect of being inundated by a tidal wave ofinexpensive, high-quality 286 and 386SX laptops, Toshiba and TexasInstruments shaved the list prices of their overpriced notebook products byas much as 40 percent.andM;The New York Times and other mainstream publications subsequently proclaimeddoom and gloom for &quot;PC clone&quot; makers.andP;  What hasn't been heralded is the factthat dealers' cost hasn't been lowered a commensurate amount.andP;  Forty-percentmargins at list used to be the rule, but the war against the direct channelhas inflicted the unkindest cut of all.andM;Dealers are complaining that the spring bouquets they received from suppliersare decidedly odoriferous, with margins as low as 25 percent.andP;  Even given thelatest round of competitive cuts, most life forms above the amoeba in thefood chain know that the direct channel is committed to maintaining itssignificant price/performance edge in both the short and long term.andM;The real losers in the latest round of price wars are small retail computerstores, and I haven;t heard a compelling argument yet that justifies grantingany of them exemption from Darwinian economics.andP;  The once-ubiquitousBusinessland chain has forsaken retail sale altogether, closing the doors onits last store in December of 1990.andP;  Given the quality of their in-storesales force, we're all safer for it.andM;ComputerLands across the country haven't been able to give IBMs or Compaqsaway.andP;  Sales of Macintosh systems and low-cost Hyundai PC compatibles aresaid to ball that's keeping the chain afloat while top management and salespersonnel continue to bail out.andM;The only retail survivors may be the software and hardware superstores, whichhave been run on slim margins from their inception.andP;  Chain store giantInacomp has apparently read the writing on the wall--it began opening its ownmegastores earlier this year.andP;  Unfortunately, such enterprises require a hugeinvestment in inventory and rapid cash flow to keep their heads above water.andM;The last time I ran over to the local CompUSA to pick up some computer rags,both the stock on the shelves and discounts on systems looked decidedlythinner than in months past.andM;So what about IBM?andP;  With its highly profitable mainframe business making likea sedated carp, IBM has found itself afloat in a lifeboat with a slow leak,amidst a sea of sharks.andP;  With the cash cow's milk turning sour, more emphasisis being placed on making sure that the business that is being brought incarries margins bigger than Word for Windows can handle.andM;If all IBM had to worry about were the &quot;high-profile&quot; competition, it wouldbe as happy as a clamshell laptop.andP;  Collectively speaking, though, the directsales channel has been kicking IBM's silicon derriere for years, and thingshave been going downhill faster than John Aker's headcount.andP;  In early 1991,even Apple Computer left them in the lurch, garnering more market share ofnew computer sales than IBM.andM;Rather than go for a bigger piece of the pie, Blue Boy is seeking to stay inPC Fat City by leaning heavily on one-third of the Lincoln principle, namely:You can fool some of the people all of the time.andP;  The siren song being sunginto the ears of tone-deaf Fortune 500 execs says IBM has a secret plan towin the computer wars, and you don't want to be caught in the wrong camp whenOperation Digital Storm is finally unleashed, do you?andM;Heck, Stormin' Norman has no problem with hundred-dollar ash trays andfive-hundred-dollar screwdrivers.andP;  Why bat a corporate eye at four thousandfor an 386SX or ten grand for a genuine IBM 486?andM;Lest we stand accused of ill-mannered Blue bashing, let's give IBM somecredit for its humanitarian works in the area of keeping dead operatingsystems alive.andP;  Virtually everyone had figured that IBM would jump on theWindows bandwagon after Bill &quot;Godfather&quot; Gates made several generous offersof peace and conciliation to the warring OS factions.andM;A month after refusing his gentle overtures, the IBM developers awoke onemorning to find the decapitated head of OS/2 in their satin sheet bed.andO;They've done a remarkable job of riding the dead horse for half a year, buteven the least-astute industry oddsmakers are beginning to get a whiff of thestate of its decomposition.andM;On a personal level, the most disconcerting aspect of the recent shock wavesemanating from the direct sales epicenter has been the virtual elimination ofwhat I used to refer to as the &quot;Rodney Dangerfield&quot; aspects of this venue.andP;  Itake pride in the fact that Shopper's audience consists of the toughest, mostinformed, and most streetwise PC purchasers in the business.andP;  However, in thenot-too-distant past, being a direct-channel booster earned one instant&quot;untouchable&quot; status in the caste system of computer public relations.andM;After spending years of perfecting the art of crashing trade-show parties andmedia events, it's downright unnerving to start getting real invitations.andO;Hmmmm ...andP;  may be if I send out copies of past columns with my RSVPs, I canget back on the blacklist.andM;Arlan Levitan has been making life a living hell for computer magazineeditors since 1981.andP;  When he is not competing with Third-World debtors of theWorld Bank for rights to Guinness' coveted &quot;missed deadlines&quot; title, hedabbles in RISC chip masks development.andP;  Arlan can be found on CompuServe at70675,463.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
