Opponents of apartheid say U.S. shareholders continue tosupport resolutions demanding that their companies reduceinvestments in South Africa and end financial links with it.</LP><TEXT>   In April, the European Community responded to PresidentF.W. de Klerk's reforms by ending the embargo on buying steeland other metals from South Africa. The International BoxingFederation ended a five-year boycott, scheduling a titlefight for June at the Sun City resort.   The Bush administration has hinted that it would like aneasing or lifting of the 1986 federal law that imposedlimited economic sanctions against South Africa. But itappears to be awaiting additional reforms before pushing forthe removal of sanctions.   U.S. opponents of apartheid argue that Mr. de Klerk'sreforms are far too modest.   Many shareholder resolutions demanding the sale of SouthAfrican assets got 10% to 20% of the votes at annual meetingsthis year, said Carolyn Mathiasen of Investor ResponsibilityResearch Center Inc. in Washington.   She said that was slightly lower than last year.Anti-apartheid activists said the vote percentages were atleast equal to 1990's.   Some of the resolutions passed and all got enough votes toremain on the agendas of 1992 annual meetings. A major goalof the movement is to embarrass companies into divestiture bykeeping the issue before the public.   Large institutional investors that led the drive fordivestiture, and businesses that have left South Africa, showlittle sign of relaxing their efforts.   Tough anti-apartheid laws passed by more than 130 stateand local governments have put the most pressure oncorporations still operating in South Africa.   Ms. Mathiasen's organization said 214 U.S. companies havepulled out since 1984 and 106 remain.   On April 26, J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. stopped processing Americandepositary receipts for South African companies. Thereceipts, known as ADRs, are a type of security that permitsU.S. investment in foreign stocks. Morgan's announcement cameafter Massachusetts legislators demanded an investigation ofthe bank's links with South Africa.   Massachusetts law prohibits companies with South Africanties from doing business with the state. Morgan, the nation'sfourth-largest bank, could have been excluded from a $2billion state bond offering.   Security Pacific Corp. of Los Angeles also has stopped itsSouth African ADR business in the past year.   On Feb. 25, Shell Oil Co. lost the renewal of a five-yearcontract to operate 13 service stations on the New JerseyTurnpike because of the company's South African investments.   Ten U.S. companies allowed their distribution or licensingagreements in South Africa to expire within the last year,according to Ms. Mathiasen's research center.   &quot;I think these are deeply held beliefs that took awhile toget into the mainstream of political thought in this country,but now they are solidly there,&quot; said Michael Zucker of theAmalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union.   Another anti-apartheid activist, John Schultz, said: &quot;Thesocial activists who oppose the apartheid system certainlyapplaud the changes that have taken place, but there is stilla long way to go.&quot; Mr. Schultz is president of the SocialInvestment Forum of Minneapolis, a group of investment funds,banks and individuals that base investment decisions on acompany's conduct.   Others say the criticism is too harsh.   If Mr. de Klerk &quot;does not receive some form ofencouragement from the U.S. to recognize what he has done, itcould . . . slow down the progress that we all want to see,&quot;said Joel Stern, a New York financial consultant.</TEXT></DOC>
