Abdul Haq, field leader of the main faction of guerrillaspositioned around Kabul, said Afghan soldiers ``don't want to diefor the regime and the party people are on their way out ofAfghanistan.''   He spoke in a recent interview in Peshawar, where a seven-partyalliance of Afghan guerillas is headquartered.   Western diplomats in Pakistan say about 10,000 members ofAfthanistan's ruling People's Democratic Party have fled the countrysince the Soviets began their withdrawal last May.   By Western estimates the party has about 55,000 members, butPresident Najib and other party leaders have placed the membershipat about 200,000.   The Soviets sent more than 100,000 soldiers into Afghanistanbeginning in December 1979 to help the government battle theanti-communist rebels. Under a U.N.-mediated agreement signed lastApril the Soviet Union is to remove all of its military forces byFeb. 15.   Haq, 30, said the Afghan Marxists ``could be taken care of infive or 15 days,'' after the Soviet pullout.   He said most of the government troopers are undisciplined youngmen pressed into military service, but he acknowledged that unitssuch as the elite Palace Guard and the state security force arestill in fighting shape.   ``They will be the last people to leave after the Soviets,'' Haqsaid.   He claimed the rebels have infiltrated the army, the Palace Guardand new communist commando units. He said some ranking militaryofficers have pledged their allegiance to the rebels but remained inthe Marxist fold to dismantle it from within once the Soviets leave.   Byt Haq said he fears there will be chaos in Kabul if rebelleaders are not ready with a political alternative to Najib'sgovernment.   The guerrillas have announced plans to convene a shura, orcouncil, consisting of 60 nominees from each of the seven rebelparties to select a transitional government.   Moscow has said a broad-based council is a move in the rightdirection but that the organization should include representativesof the People's Democratic Party.   Haq said such a combination of anti-communist Moslems andMarxists would be ``a formula for continued fighting and not peace.''   In Iran, a spokesman for Afghan rebels based there complainedthat they had not been consulted about political moves beingprepared by their colleagues in Pakistan.   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, in a report monitored inCyprus, quoted Mohammad Karim Khalili of the Iran-based Afghanrebels as saying on state-run television: ``The decision to createsuch a shura has been made without coordination with the coalitionand independent Afghan groups.''   The Afghan resistance is divided into two major groups _ theIran-based Shiite Moslem alliance and the larger Sunni Moslemcoalition headquartered n Pakistan.   The Shiite alliance, fearing it would lack strength in the shura,wants a Cabinet to be formed before agreeing on the council.</TEXT></DOC>
