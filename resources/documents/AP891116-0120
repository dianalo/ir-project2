WELCH</BYLINE><UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Congressional supporters of expanded federalfinancing of abortions are conceding defeat for this year but saythey'll renew their fight next year, aided by growing politicalpressures.   ``This is not the last inning, not by any means,'' said Rep. LesAuCoin, D-Ore., a leader of the abortion-rights lawmakers. ``Westill have next year, and if that doesn't work out, we have nextNovember's elections.''   The House on Wednesday approved an appropriations bill forhealth and other programs that includes abortion language _demanded by President Bush _ that continues the ban on federallyfunded abortions for poor women except when the life of the motheris in danger.   Bush vetoed a previous version of the bill last month because itwould have permitted federally financed Medicaid abortions for poorwomen who are victims of rape or incest.   The Senate approved the bill today, after adding a series ofunrelated amendments, including one providing penalties forproviding ``dial-a-porn'' obscene telephone communications tominors. The bill now goes back to the House for concurrence.   The Senate passed the appropriations bill on a voice vote andwith virtually no mention of the abortion issue. Sen. ArlenSpecter, R-Pa., noted that the House had failed to sustain Bush'sveto of the abortion provision.   ``That is the conclusion of that issue,'' Specter said. ``Thetime has come for us to move ahead. ... The time for talk hasended.''   Although the rape-and-incest provision covers a relatively smallnumber of additional abortions, by most estimates, the issue becamea symbolic battleground in the political struggle over abortion.That struggle has taken on increased intensity since the SupremeCourt last summer gave states more leeway to regulate abortions,and proponents of abortion rights won key elections last week inVirginia and New Jersey.   Last month's House vote was the first time in a decade it hadbacked the more liberal abortion provisions, which the Senate alsoapproved. But the House failed by 51 votes to override Bush's veto.   AuCoin said abortion-rights supporters believe politicalpressure will build as a result of Bush's veto and increased publicattention on the abortion issue.   They rejected what they described as compromise efforts byanti-abortion lawmakers to permit financing of abortions for rapeand incest victims who report the crimes within a time limit, suchas 72 hours. AuCoin said that would be a ``bogus compromise''providing political cover to lawmakers who voted to sustain Bush'sveto.   The House approved the bill on a voice vote after an emotionaland sometimes bitter revival of the debate over abortion.Anti-abortion forces did not attempt to amend or defeat the measure.   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who has led the fight for abortionrestrictions, took strong exception to AuCoin's reference to Hyde'sside as being ``anti-choice,'' and hurled stronger words back.   ``The pro-killer crowd _ the death squads of the left,'' Hydesaid. ``We can play that game too.''   The disputed abortion provision is part of a $157 billionappropriations bill for labor, education and health programs forthe 1990 fiscal year.   The House and Senate both approved another appropriations billfor the District of Columbia, which Bush similarly vetoed becauseof abortion. The new version, approved 229-191, prohibits the useof federal money for D.C.-funded abortions except when the mother'slife is endangered, but would let the district government use localfunds for abortions.   Anti-abortion forces said the House action on the D.C. billcould invite another Bush veto.   At the same time, the administation suffered at least atemporary setback in the Senate, which voted 52-44 to insist on aprovision in a foreign aid spending bill that would send $15million to the United Nations Population Fund.   Abortion opponents want to delete the money because the U.N.agency operates in China, which has restrictive limits on familysize and allegedly imposes forced abortions and sterilizations onwomen. The Senate vote sent the bill back to the House, which voteda day earlier to give Bush the final decision on whether o fund theU.N. agency.</TEXT></DOC>
