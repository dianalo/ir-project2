Mr. Meisler, who said he continues tothink that the stock and bond markets are headed for a rally,called yesterday's action &quot;sloppy, with no real trends.&quot;   Business among institutional investors picked up atDonaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette, according to Robert Antolini,head of the firm's OTC trading department. But he noted thatinvestors didn't place big bets among the most active stocks,where prices were relatively stable. Among the most heavilytraded issues, Apple was up 1/8 at 38 7/8; Intel was up 1/4at 40; Sun Microsystems gained 3/8 to 23; MCI Communicationsrose 5/8 to 35 3/8; and Seagate Technology rose 1/4 to 11.   Smaller investors continued to stay away from the market,Mr. Antolini said. &quot;It's the state of the securities businessat the moment,&quot; he explained. &quot;Most of the retail orders nowhave their money in mutual funds and let other people maketheir decisions for them.&quot;   Stockholder Systems of Norcross, Ga., was the day'sbiggest gainer. Shares of the marketer of financial softwaresoared 51% to 14 after the company said it agreed to beacquired by Nynex, the New York-based Baby Bell company.Under a pooling transaction, each Stockholder Systems sharewill be exchanged for one share of Nynex common worth between$15 to $16.20.   Two small biotechnology companies, Centocor and Xoma,again stepped into the spotlight as debate continued overwhich company will benefit the most from competing drugs theyare developing to treat septic shock syndrome.   Centocor jumped 3 1/2 to 33 1/4 after Kidder Peabodyanalyst Robert Kupor upgraded his investment opinion on thebiotechnology company to an &quot;aggressive buy&quot; from a &quot;hold.&quot;Mr. Kupor said in an interview that he thinks Centocor'sCentoxin will be used by far more doctors to treat septicshock syndrome than a competing drug, Xomen-E5, developed byBerkeley, Calif.-based Xoma, whose shares fell 1 1/8 to 183/4.   Calling Centoxin far more effective in treating later,deadlier stages of the syndrome, Mr. Kupor said he now thinksthe company will eventually capture about 75% of a world-widemarket for the drugs that he estimates will be $1 billion.The analyst raised his earnings outlook for the Malvern,Penn.-based company, and now expects Centocor to earn $1.45 ashare in 1991, $3.85 a share in 1992 and $5 a share in 1993.   However, Shearson's Mr. Meisler said that firm'sbiotechnology analyst, Teena L. Lerner, continues to thinkthat Xoma will come out on top in competition with Centocor.   Phoenix-based Aztar was a newcomer among the most-actives.Nearly 1.1 million of the casino operator's shares traded, orabout three times average volume; it closed up 3/8 at 6 3/8.Paul E.
