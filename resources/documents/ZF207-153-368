(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>WriteNow 2.0andM;I must be getting old.andP;  Three years ago a word processor this powerful wouldhave satisfied everyone, even me.andP;  It would have been the talk of the town.andO;But in 1989, even its publisher rates WriteNow 2.0 as just an entry- tomedium-level word processor.andP;  Special, but not one of the big three.andM;Even so, WriteNow is the fastest, best pure writing program available.andP;  Itdoes the basic thing that word processors were created to do best.andP;  You'renot going to find graphics editors, add-on or Post-it notes, page-layoutability, indexing, or outlining in WriteNow.andM;Of course, being too pure a writing tool isn't a virtue either.andP;  Today'stechnology offers a lot to writers, and WriteNow has a good and usefulselection of writing features.andP;  There's an excellent spelling checker, mailmerge (including label creation), graphics inclusion, footnotes, andexcellent header and footer control.andM;WriteNow isn't a new program.andP;  The original version was a well-received,justly popular program, but it lacked a lot of features.andP;  For example,importing and exporting (even to text-only files) required a separatetranslator program.andP;  Version 1.0 of WriteNow was praised for its speed, itsability to run on any Mac (including 128K machines), and its excellentbuilt-in spelling checker.andP;  The new version has kept all that was good inversion 1.0 (what a pleasant surprise!) and has added to the program.andM;WriteNow still runs on any Mac, a feat remarkable in this day of wordprocessors that require multiple megabytes of memory and hard disks.andP;  Version2.0 is even faster than the previous version, which used to be the fastestword processor.andP;  It also has a new and equally good spelling checker that canuse the same dictionaries that version 1.0 used, so you can still use yourcustomized dictionary.andM;The list of new and improved features is too long to print in its entiretyhere.andP;  One of the highlights is direct import and export to text only, textwith line breaks, MacWrite, and RTF formats.andP;  RTF is Microsoft's Rich TextFormat and is currently the only way to import from and export to Word.andO;However, WriteNow now uses external filters for import and export.andP;  Thatmeans that T/Maker can produce and cheaply distribute new filters.andP;  They'reworking on one specifically for Word, and if it isn't available now, it willbe out shortly.andM;Other notable new features include full cursor-key support; the ability tohide graphics in documents, which speeds up the already excellentperformance; a built-in utility that counts characters, words, andparagraphs; both static and dynamic time and date stamps; and a Window menu-- useful since you can have many documents open at once.andP;  &quot;Smart quotes&quot; areavailable for those who prefer them.andM;WriteNow has a wonderful interface, as intuitive as the original MacWriteinterface.andP;  You really don't need to refer to the excellent manual to getstarted.andP;  The basic writing tools and functions are right where they shouldbe, and there are very few surprises in using them.andP;  This is the way a Macapplication is supposed to work.andM;There are a few things that I wish T/Maker had done differently.andP;  I don'tlike the way line spacing is controlled.andP;  Instead of clicking on icons in aruler or using menu commands to select single, space-and-a-half, or doublespacing, you use an icon to adjust the spacing one point at a click (or holdthe mouse button down continuously and watch the increments zip by).andP;  Todouble-space 12-point type requires 12 clicks; to get it back to singlespacing (after it's too late to Undo) requires 12 more clicks.andP;  Not only isthat too much unnecessary labor, it doesn't always produce optimal spacing.andO;Some very small-bodied fonts look double-spaced with less than exactly doubletheir size as line spacing, while the reverse is true for some large-bodiedfonts.andP;  Word actually makes such distinctions.andP;  While the system used istotally flexible, presets that take into account type size and style wouldhave been nice -- at least for single, space-and-a-half, and double spacing.andM;One nice touch is that line spacing can be fixed or flexible.andP;  Fixed spacingfreezes the actual distance between lines, regardless of what size of type isin the line or whether there are graphics in the line.andP;  Flexible spacingallows the actual spacing to adjust to fit large characters, super- andsubscripts, and graphics.andM;What you see is really what you get with WriteNow.andP;  The program can handle upto four columns of text.andP;  It shows the actual columns on the screen with theactual column breaks.andP;  As you edit or add text, you can see the breaks changeto reflect your editing.andP;  The screen also shows headers, footers, andfootnotes as they will appear when printed.andP;  The only thing that keeps themultiple-column screen from being perfect is that the tops of the columnsusually appear misaligned on-screen.andP;  Don't worry, WriteNow does that toavoid some time-consuming recalculations.andP;  When you pring, everything will beproperly aligned at the top.andM;There's one problem with the way WriteNow deals with columns.andP;  Although theactual text is handled very well, the margins and the spaces between columnsare handled very akwardly.andM;The space between columns is the sum of hte left and right margins of thecolumns.andP;  There's no easy way, for example, to have the left-most columnflush left and the right-most column flush right and a 1/4-inch space betweencolumns.andP;  In fact, there's no way to specify a single intercolumn width.andO;This needs fixing.andM;Fonts are handled in the normal Macintosh manner, which is to say correctly.andO;In addition to the normal style options, you can select condensed or expandedtype.andP;  Expanded type often prints much better on ink-jet printers like GCCTechnologies' Write-Move.andM;There's no provision for style sheets, other than the ability to copy andpaste rulers.andP;  For me, this is WriteNow's worst shortcoming.andP;  The manualsuggests several workarounds that can give something of a limited style sheeteffect, but I found them involved enough to fall into the Why Bothercategory.andM;The ability to find and replace material is vital to writers.andP;  The WriteNowFind/Replace function is excellent.andP;  You can search for a single wild-cardcharacter and find and replace based on font, size, or style.andM;Footnotes are well done.andP;  Very long footnotes are broken over multiple pages(or columns) as necessary.andP;  Your footnotes can contain graphics as well astext.andP;  Unfortunately, your footnotes are exactly that: notes at the bottom ofthe page where they are referenced.andP;  There's no provision for automaticallycreating endnotes.andM;The spelling checker has an interface that I wasn't used to, and its buttonsand shortcuts were also new to me.andP;  However, it's a very easy module tolearn, and far less complicated than several less capable spelling checkers.andO;It shows well-chosen suggestions in buttons, but this seems to slow thingsdown at times.andM;WriteNow comes with three dictionaries.andP;  The 50,000-word dictionary is whatwill be used if you don't take any other action.andP;  It's a good, fairlycomplete dictionary, and adding and deleting entries is simple.andP;  But if youhave a hard disk, you should use the excellent 100,000-word dictionary.andO;There's also a blank (empty) dictionary that you can use to create your owncustom dictionary.andM;For the more technically oriented, superscripts and subscripts can themselvesbe superscripted and subscripted to as many levels as you desire.andP;  WhiteNowprovides left, center, right, and decimal tabs to aid in creating tabularmaterial, and you can easily add leaders before any tab.andP;  Leaders can beadjusted by changing font sizes.andM;If you're a writer shopping for a new word processor and you don't need thepage-layout or indexing features of the $400 programs, WriteNow will serveall of your needs for half the price.andP;  If speed is important to you, you'renot going to find a faster word processor.andP;  A few things need improvement,but overall WriteNow is a superb program and a real (and rare) bargain.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
