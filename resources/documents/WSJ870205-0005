An inter-agency group reporting to Poindexter defined &quot;sensitive&quot; in the broadest of terms, to include &quot;unclassified information that could adversely affect national security or other federal government interests.&quot;. . .    FBI, CIA and Defense Department officials have already visited such commercial information services as Mead Data Central's Nexis and Lockheed's Dialog to inquire as to the names of their clients. . . .    In line with previous administration efforts to gut the Freedom of Information Act, impose lifetime gag orders and conduct random polygraph tests on thousands of government officials, censor scientific papers and target leakers with the Espionage Act, this latest maneuver represents yet another assault on the free marketplace of ideas.    Ronald Reagan's appointees apparently believe in privatizing only power plants and railroads, not information. </TEXT></DOC>
