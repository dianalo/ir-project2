Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, the head of the joint chiefs of staff,called for linking the issues of cutting off arms to the Salvadoraninsurgents and demobilizing U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels, known asContras.   This would ``make the pacification process truly regional,'' hesaid in an interview.   A regional peace process began in August 1987, when five CentralAmerican presidents signed a peace accord known as Esquipulas IIthat called for ending civil wars in Nicaragua, El Salvador andGuatemala.   ``As it is now, it appears the only objective of Esquipulas IIis to dismantle the Contras and consolidate the Sandinistagovernment'' in Nicaragua, Ponce said.   El Salvador's rightist president-elect, Alfredo Cristiani,echoed Ponce's claims Friday during a news conference in CostaRica. He said the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front``recently received new arms from Cuba and Nicaragua, and I don'tthink this indicates the Sandinista government wants peace,'' hesaid.   Cristiani, who takes over June 1 as head of this country'sU.S.-backed government, said Nicaragua is the main obstacle toregional peace.   He was in Costa Rica to discuss the next regional summit withPresident Oscar Arias, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for hisefforts toward regional peace.   In San Salvador, Ponce spoke in the joint chiefs briefing roomnext to an array of 30 Soviet-bloc weapons _ AK-47 assault rifles,Dragunov sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, andsubmachine guns.   Ponce said the weapons were among 60 East-bloc arms capturedfrom insurgent forces this year.   He said 70 percent of rebel weapons come from Cuba and Nicaragua.   Ponce said arms shipments to rebel forces increased beginninglast September. Army intelligence now figures 1,000 AKs haveentered the country in recent months.   The rebels says they capture the vast majority of their arms andmunitions from government soldiers.   They maintain offices in Managua but deny receiving anything butmoral and diplomatic support from Nicaragua.   Rebel leaders interviewed in their northern strongholds say theyhave bought Soviet-bloc weapons, including several hundred AK-47s,since late last year. They say the weapons came from Contra rebelcamps in Honduras.   ``Some Contras may have sold their weapons on the black market,and the (Salvadoran) subversives may have obtained some of themthat way. But not 1,000,'' Ponce said.   He said Nicaragua sends arms to Salvadoran rebels by land andsea in shipments of about 50 rifles at a time. The land routesinclude a stretch through Honduran territory along the mountainousborder with El Salvador.   Ponce said that without outside support, the rebels would losetheir military strength and would have to resort to terrorism.   He said small Nicaraguan vessels, ostensibly fishing craft,deliver arms to guerrillas at several points along El Salvador'sPacific coast.   But he acknowledged that no vessel has been caught transportingsuch weapons.   More than 65,000 Salvadorans, mostly civilians, have been killedin the country's eight-year civil war.</TEXT></DOC>
