The major trade bill now before Congress would permit thecharging of extra ``countervailing'' duties on imports of theAirbus. They would be designed to compensate for the subsidies,raising the price of the foreign planes and thus improving thechances of U.S. aircraft manufacturers making sales to airlineshere.   ``The longer these governments delay in coming to grips withtheir own subsidies for Airbus, the more they heighten the risk ofa major trade conflict,'' Yeutter said in a statement.   With the statement, Yeutter's office distributed a detailedrefutation of a report on March 18 by Airbus Industrie, theconsortium that makes the planes, on U.S. subsidies to aircraftmanufacturers. He criticized the report as containing ``poorscholarship and false conclusions.''   It said the U.S. government had provided about $23 billion indirect and indirect subsidies over the past decade to Boeing Co.and McDonnell Douglas Corp.   U.S. trade officials have long complained that the Europeansubsidies give European aircraft builders an unfair advantage overU.S. companies.   ``The U.S. does not directly support civil aircraft programs,''Yeutter said. ``It is the four European governments that havelavished gigantic sums on Airbus for nearly two decades despite theprogram's inability to show any profit.''   He said he expects to see members of the European governments inParis in mid-May and would like to discuss indirect subsidiesbefore then.   ``We will not hold such discussions on the basis of a `study'that has no credibility,'' he said.   After the last negotiations at Constance, West Germany, on March18, Yeutter said a first step had been taken in a prospectiveagreement on production subsidies but that there was still a longway to go on subsidies for research and development.   The statement issued by Yeutter's office said the U.S.government buys goods for its own needs and not to benefit anymanufacturer. When major contractors make profits, they can spendthem as they will, it added.   ``By contrast, the Airbus partners must spend the money suppliedto them by their governments on commercial airplane development andnothing else,'' the statement said.</TEXT></DOC>
