This framework is needed whatever weapons are actuallyused, and the research, development, and experimentation required toprovide it involves most of the critical technologies. This surveillancesystem should evolve as the supporting technology becomes available,allowing the inclusion of whatever weapons are available and wanted.This restructuring would help assure priority attention to critical technicalproblems despite budget uncertainties and 3) Deployment should be insteps, each of which should provide some capability and have some valuein itself.</TEXT></DOC>
