No. 07/528,586,      filed May 24, 2990, abandoned. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates to a method for creating a design on fabric and/or      garments. </PAR><PAR>  Over the years, in response to changing fashion demands, various methods      have been developed for patterning fabrics. An early example of such a      method is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 1,024,668, which teaches a method for      transferring a pattern of a color changing agent from a paper web to a      fabric. The pattern may be formed on the paper web by application of      discharges, which are agents for removing color from selected areas of a      substrate which has been previously colored. The actual transfer of the      pattern on the paper web to the fabric is effected in various ways,      including employing a roller or the pressure of an engine. Such a method,      however, employing large cumbersome machinery, is time consuming, labor      intensive and costly. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 1,905,346 discloses a method of producing color effects on      fabric, particularly fabric containing organic derivatives of cellulose,      by discharge printing with an oxidizing agent. More specifically, the      fabric is treated with a discharge paste including a thickening agent,      e.g., cellulose ethers, and an oxidizing agent. </PAR><PAR>  In other prior methods for imprinting textiles, a coloring agent floating      upon the surface of a liquid bath is transferred to a fabric or garment so      as to create a desired effect. U.S. Pat. No. 1,846,845 discloses a process      and apparatus for imparting a variegated design to webs of air-porous      material, particularly textile fabrics, wherein a design of color is      floated on the surface of a carrier liquid, preferably water, and is taken      off the surface by a web of the fabric to be patterned. </PAR><PAC>  OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  It is a primary object of this invention to provide a method for creating a      design on fabric, particularly denim garments, which provides a      satisfactory and desired appearance on the garment. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of this invention to provide a method which is      convenient to employ and more efficient than present methods of imprinting      fabrics. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object of this invention to provide a method which, when      used in conjunction with a conventional washing process, will not damage      or excessively wear fabrics and garments, and will result in garments      having a desired imprinted design without involving a high level of      textile wear. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Broadly, the invention is in a method for creating designs on fabrics      wherein a garment is contacted with the surface of a patterning medium,      which surface has upon it a pattern formed from an oxidizing or reducing      agent. The pattern is transferred to the garment and the oxidizing or      reducing agent creates the desired color effect on the garment. More      specifically, the patterning medium, which comprises cellulosic ethers,      e.g., hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, having viscosities broadly in the      range of from 10 to 100,000 cp as measured in 2% aqueous solutions at      20.degree. C., is contained in a trough. Oxidizing or reducing agent is      added to the surface of the cellulosic ether in a desired pattern before      the garment is contacted with that surface. After the garment has been      contacted, it may be treated by art-known methods with neutralizing      agents, rinsed, and further processed. </PAR></BSUM><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The object of the invention, the creation of a desired design on fabric, is      achieved by preparing a patterning medium comprising one or more grades of      cellulose ethers, preferably hydroxypropyl methylcellulose ethers. The      patterning medium is contained in a trough having a depth of several      inches and a width and length sufficient to accommodate the garment which      is to be patterned. Advantageous results are obtained where the trough      size conforms to the garment size. The method involves the step of adding      to the surface of the patterning medium, by means of random dripping,      splashing, spraying, or pouring, an oxidizing or reducing agent. The      oxidizing or reducing agent and the patterning medium are then moved      about, i.e., swirled, together, with a rake or spatula or the like, so as      to form a desired pattern on the patterning medium surface. </PAR><PAR>  A garment is then placed so that one side of its exterior surface contacts      the patterning medium surface, for a time sufficient to permit the      oxidizing or reducing agent to be transferred onto the garment and to      partially oxidize or reduce the color in the garment or fabric. The      garment or fabric is then turned over and the exterior surface of its      other side contacted with the patterning medium. Generally, the contact      time is from 10 to 600 seconds per side. More typically, the contact time      is 20 to 40 seconds per side. In a preferred embodiment, the contact time      is about 1 minute per side. </PAR><PAR>  The garment is then rinsed with a neutralizing agent to neutralize any      excess oxidizing or reducing agent on the garment, and further rinsed with      water to remove any excess cellulose ethers from the garment. The finished      garment will have patterned thereupon a design which substantially      reflects the design pattern which was initially placed on the surface of      the patterning medium. </PAR><PAR>  Any of the commercially available cellulosic ethers may be employed to form      the pattern. By way of example, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose having      viscosities of 50 to 4000 cp for 2% aqueous solutions at 20.degree. C. are      known and commercially available as Methocel E-50 and E-4M, respectively      (Dow Chemical Company registered trademarks. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose      as used in accordance with the invention is known and commercially      available as Klucel (a Hercules, Inc., registered trademark). A preferred      medium is hydroxypropyl methylcellulose having a viscosity from 10 to      100,000 cp as measured in a 2% aqueous solution at 20.degree. C. </PAR><PAR>  The patterning agent may be either an oxidizing agent or a reducing agent.      Any of the known oxidizing and reducing agents may be employed in the      method of the invention. For example, oxidizing agents such as the alkali      and alkaline earth metal salts of hypochlorous acid, e.g., sodium      hypochlorite, may be employed to advantage. The strength of the bleaching      agent and the amount used depends on the desired look of the finished      garment. Broadly, a solution of 0.5 to 15.0% by weight of sodium      hypochlorite may be used to pattern the surface of the medium and from 10      to 1000 ml of such a solution may be employed for each garment to be      patterned. </PAR><PAR>  The garment or fabric to be imprinted with the desired pattern is generally      made of denim, but any cotton or cotton-blended garment or fabric, whether      woven or knitted, may be patterned using the process of the invention. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAR>  A trough which is 30&quot; wide, 40&quot; long, and 3&quot; deep is substantially filled      with a 2% by weight solution of hydroxyethylcellulose. The viscosity of      the solution is 3000 cps at 25.degree. C as measured by a No. 6 spindle 20      rpm Brookfield Viscometer. </PAR><PAR>  A 2% by weight solution of sodium hypochlorite is applied to the surface of      the medium in the trough with a spray bottle. About 50 ml are used for      each side of the garment to be patterned. After the hypochlorite solution      has been sprayed upon the surface, it is lightly mixed into the base      material with a spatula. </PAR><PAR>  A denim garment is then positioned on the surface of the medium for about      30 seconds and then flipped over and the other side maintained for about      30 seconds. </PAR><PAR>  The garment is then further processed to neutralize the oxidizing agent and      to wash off excess base material. The garment is placed in a 1% solution      of sodium bisulfite and then washed in a standard washing machine with a      solution of 3% sodium bisulfite for five minutes at 120.degree. F., and      thereafter rinsed with water for 4 minutes at 160.degree. F. The garment      may thereafter be further processed as is known in the art. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
