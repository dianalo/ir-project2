For years, big corporations have routinely flung adivision to Denver and a subsidiary to Seattle. But now agrowing number of small and medium-sized companies are alsoseparating operations and putting thousands of miles betweenthem. They are building warehouses in Ohio because it has acentral heartland location. They're creating customer-servicetoll-free numbers in Des Moines because Iowans speak with anall-American accent. They're setting up data-processingoffices in North Dakota because the farm belt bulges withskilled people eager to work.</LP><TEXT>   Many also are finding that packing off operations tofaraway locales can save on taxes, satisfy employees, cuttravel costs or even get an operation a couple of time zonescloser to Europe.   Behind the decentralization is the increasingsophistication of telecommunications. The proliferation ofeverything from affordable facsimile machines to cellularphones to sophisticated toll-free telephone arrangements haschipped away at the disadvantages of distance.   &quot;Geography is becoming increasingly irrelevant,&quot; saysCraig Aronoff, founder of the Family Business Forum inMarietta, Ga. &quot;People who recognize this are able to takeadvantage of the same economies as big corporations.&quot;   Patricia Gallup discovered last year how much she couldgain from separating operations. The president and co-founderof PC Connection Inc. wouldn't consider moving from heridyllic (and low-tax) corner of rural New England. Hermail-order firm for computer software and accessoriesoperates out of a remodeled mill and Victorian inn in Marlow,N.H., and she likes to boast about her window views of themill pond, the waterfall and the pine trees.   But her company promises next-day noon delivery. It iseasier to move goods quickly throughout the U.S. from theplains of the Midwest than from a village in the mountains ofNew Hampshire. So Ms. Gallup started speeding deliveries byshipping from a big warehouse it leases in Wilmington, Ohio,last year. Central location isn't the only advantage. &quot;Youcan draw your employees from two labor pools,&quot; she says. &quot;Fora fast-growing company, that's important.&quot;   Computer and telecommunications technologies developed inthe past several years, especially electronic mail andfacsimile transmission, made the move possible byfacilitating instantaneous communication between distantpoints, she says. The same technological advances fostered aninstant-gratification psychology among consumers thatinspired the quick-delivery policy -- and thus made the movenecessary.   The problem for Coverall Cleaning Concepts wasn't movingmachinery; it was moving people, says chief operating officerTed Elliott. Executives of the San Diego office-cleaningfranchiser were spending endless hours in the air to get tomeetings in the Midwest and on the East Coast. The problemwas sure to get worse as the privately held company, whichexpects revenue to jump to $18 million this year from $12million last year, expanded into Europe.   In 1988, Coverall Cleaning opened a satellite headquartersin Chicago, whose O'Hare Airport is a national andinternational hub. The president, the accounting manager andthe national franchise sales director, as well as severaladvertising people, stayed in San Diego. Mr. Elliott, alongwith the vice president for corporate regions, the areafranchise director, the special-projects director, thenational-operations director and several research andadvertising people moved to Chicago.   &quot;It takes about an hour and a half to get to New York orBoston from here, compared with five hours from California,&quot;says Mr. Elliott. The split not only saves time and fareexpenses, it enables the company to keep in phone contactwith its burgeoning network in Britain and France, where thebusiness day ends as California's begins.   Hal Rosenbluth, president of Rosenbluth Travel Inc. ofPhiladelphia, says he was motivated more by a desire to helpdrought victims than by financial considerations when hedecided to transfer some bookkeeping work to the Midwest inthe summer of 1988. Now, he says, &quot;it's almost become acrusade of our company to blend rural and corporate America.&quot;   His original plan was to hire 20 people somewhere in thefarm belt for temporary data-entry jobs. But when 80 peopleapplied for the positions in the little town of Linton, N.D.,he took on 40 of them. What happened next stunned him.   &quot;There was virtually no absenteeism or turnover. Thequality of the work was extremely high,&quot; says Mr. Rosenbluth.So he made the jobs permanent and kept hiring; the number ofemployees in Linton totals 100 today, and is expected to growto 200 soon.   While Rosenbluth Travel has regional offices, Linton isthe only place outside the Philadelphia headquarters that isassigned national tasks, currently data-entry,data-processing and accounting. In January, the company willalso install a &quot;total-client-satisfaction center&quot; in theNorth Dakota town, says Mr. Rosenbluth.   Five years ago, he adds, such a foray into the unknownwouldn't have been possible. &quot;The telecommunicationsstructure wasn't there -- the fiber optics that run into ourfacilities,&quot; he says. And Mr. Rosenbluth says he still heldto the &quot;ethnocentric belief that you should do business rightwhere you are. That's eroding as people see how technologyerodes boundaries.&quot;   That erosion is something even the very small businessowner can exploit. Take Charles Gleason, owner of GleasonCorp., a life-insurance firm with about half a milliondollars in annual revenue. Mr. Gleason used to fight traffican hour each way to get to his Detroit office in the morningand his home to the suburbs in the evening.   Today, he works at home, when he's not taking his 10-plusweeks of annual vacation. Make that at homes -- the one onthe lake in Chelsea, Mich., in the summer and the one onSanibel Island, a Florida vacation spot and wildlife refuge,in the winter.   Technology made the switch possible, he says. Fax machinesare invaluable, as is the telephone technology that canswitch 800 calls from location to location and route serviceinquiries to his administrative assistant's office in herhome near Pontiac, Mich. Gleason Corp.'s overhead costs aredown and, because the firm is in two markets now, itseconomic base is broader. &quot;Business in Detroit has been adisaster for the past two years, but Florida is booming,&quot; Mr.Gleason says.   &quot;I'm on the cutting edge of a new business philosophy,&quot; heexults. &quot;This new technology we have can enhance our lifestyle. I used to play golf two or three times a year. Now Iplay two or three times a week.&quot; Another advantage for the62-year-old insurance salesman is that he can drift at hisown pace into eventual retirement. Meanwhile, he says hemakes between $115,000 and $175,000 a year.   Of course, splitting up a company's operations hasdrawbacks. One is cost: Ms. Gallup of PC Connection notes shehad to &quot;duplicate all her systems,&quot; from support staff toback-up power generators, at her new Ohio facility. Anotheris loss of camaraderie. Mr. Elliott of Coverall Cleaning sayshe misses &quot;brainstorming with the president over lunch,&quot; andgripes that getting the core executives together has become amajor production. And Mr. Gleason says changing his workplacetwice a year means &quot;I lose a lot of momentum.&quot;   But Mr. Elliott, for one, thinks dispersing operations isthe wave of the future. &quot;The survivors are already doing it,&quot;he says.   &quot;It's a must.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
