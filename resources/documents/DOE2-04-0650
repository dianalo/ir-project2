<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-04-0650 </DOCNO><TEXT>After privatization of the UK Electricity Supply Industry (ESI), the newArea Boards will be free to generate their own electricity and this islikely to result in the opening up of the UK market to imported steamcoal. It has been estimated that the current generating system couldabsorb 10/15 mta of steam coal imports with only minimum required portinvestment. At present, however, there is only one significant deepwaterport that can handle fully-laden Cape size carriers (the British Steelberth at Hunterston, on the Clyde) and sustained expansion will be dependenton some improvement in the import terminal industry. The CEGB in fact,already has plans underway for an 8 mta import berth at Fawley, nearSouthampton which will accommodate Cape size vessels and serve new coal-firedpower stations. Further private terminals are planned for constructionon the east coast. Demand for imported steam coal is likely to causeonly gradual increases in price, if it is itself gradual rather thansudden. If this is the case, coal imports will retain their cost advantage.2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
