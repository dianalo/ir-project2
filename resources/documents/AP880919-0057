The handwritten Arabic language statement, signed by the IslamicJihad for the Liberation of Palestine, was accompanied by aphotograph showing the four hostages playing cards. It wasdelivered Sunday to the Beirut office of a Western news agency andBeirut's An-Nahar newspaper.   The four men were kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987 from the campus of theU.S.-affilitated Beirut University College. They are Alann Steen,49, a journalism instructor; Jesse Turner, 41, a visiting professorof mathematics and computer science; Robert Polhill, 55, a lecturerin accounting; and Mithileshwar Singh, 60, a visiting professor offinance and a legal resident alien of the United States.   The kidnappers first offered to free the four in a statementreleased Thursday. The latest statement, like the previous one,said the hostages would be freed if the United States declaressupport for the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied WestBank and Gaza Strip.   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine is believed to bemade up of Shiite Moslem zealots loyal to Iran and sympathetic tothe Palestine Liberation Organization.   ``This initiative still stands and we are waiting for responsesin light of which we shall take the next steps required by theinterests of the blessed uprising,'' the statement said.   ``Our inclination to free the hostages is not an invitation fornegotiations, but it comes within our conviction of human andethical values,'' it said.   That appeared to be a reply to the U.S. State Department'sassertion, in response to Thursday's statement, that it wasunwilling to negotiate with the kidnappers.   The recent statements by the captors has triggered speculationthat they are softening their demands.   The group previously had demanded the release of 400 Arabprisoners held by Israel and its militia allies in south Lebanon.Israel refused to free anyone.   They four educators are among 17 foreigners missing and believedkidnapped in Lebanon since March 1985. The others are sixAmericans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and twounidentified men.   The longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped in Beiruton March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
