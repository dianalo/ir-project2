It was Shamir's most conciliatory statement yet on Israel'sfuture role in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   ``At a certain stage, when there is autonomy, the army will leaveseveral urban centers and be focused in some other areas,'' he toldreporters after addressing a group of visiting American rabbis.   Shamir pointed out that a troop redeployment is called for in theU.S.-brokered Camp David accords, which he supports.   The 1978 accords call for electing local Palestinianrepresentatives to hold peace talks with Israel, along withrepresentatives of Egypt and Jordan.   There would then be a five-year period of autonomy, followed byfurther negotiations on the final status of the territories.   The PLO and many Palestinians in the territories occupied in the1967 Middle East war reject the Camp David accords and the conceptof autonomy, maintaining these ideas are intended to circumvent thePLO and contradict Palestinian demands for an independent state.   Shamir said the most crucial step in the peace process is tobegin negotiations. ``Once we get to this stage, positive resultswill come,'' he said.   But he reiterated that Israel will not speak to the PalestineLiberation Organization and will not accept an independentPalestinian state.   Shamir outlined his views as paralleling the Camp David accords,which led to Israel's peace treaty with Egypt.   ``The peace process will be comprised of two stages,'' he said.``First an interim condition and this will include full autonomy. Inthe second stage (there will be) direct negotiations withoutpreconditions between Israel, Palestinian Arabs and Arab countries.''   Shamir's government has been under increasing pressure to pursuea peace initiative because of international criticism of its strongpolicies in putting down the 13-month uprising in the occupiedterritories and PLO chief Yasser Arafat's latest diplomaticinitiative.   At least 370 Palestinians have been killed, most by Israeli armygunfire, since Palestinians began their rebellion against Israel'soccupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Arafat made a series of statements last fall saying the PLOaccepted Israel's right to exist and renounced terrorism.   In December, the United States agreed to open a dialogue with thePLO based on Arafat's statements, and several of Israel's Europeanallies have urged Israel to open talks with Arafat's representatives.</TEXT></DOC>
