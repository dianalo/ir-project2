The Group of Seven industrial democracies ganged up against thedollar after agreeing last weekend that the dollar's rise in recentmonths was ``inconsistent with longer run economic fundamentals.''   Tuesday's intervention knocked only a fraction of a percent offthe dollar's value, in contrast to Monday's decline of nearly 6West German pfennigs and 4 Japanese yen.   Some traders said the attractiveness of U.S. interest ratesmight bring investors back to dollar-denominated securities oncethe central bankers let up.   In fact, the dollar ended the day above its lows of the session.   ``Maybe the dollar has taken it just a little bit on the chinbut it has fought back quite nicely,'' said Victor Polce, vicepresident and manager of corporate foreign exchange at AlgemeneBank Nederland NV in New York.   Dealers agreed that most of the major government banks had solddollars, but they disagreed on how large the sales were.   Some of the dollar's drop against the West German mark came fromcontinued speculation that the West German central bank would raisea key interest rate next month, drawing global investors away fromdollars and into marks.   In contrast, the dollar rose against the Japanese yen becausefewer people expected the Bank of Japan to raise rates, dealerssaid.
