The Commission initiated this proceeding June 7, 1983, with the releaseof a Notice of Inquiry (NOI), FCC 83-525. That NOI stated that the Commissionsought to develop policies and guidelines for the construction and useof common carrier transmission facilities in the Caribbean region duringthe 1985-1995 period. Six alternative plans were proposed by the UnitedStates International Service Carriers (USISCs) and Communications SatelliteCorporation (Comsat) for consideration. The USISCs proposed the introductionof digital or analog cables linking the region, while Comsat offered twoNo New Cables plans.2. On February 5, 1986, the Commission released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(NPRM) narrowing the range of alternative plans which should receive furtherconsideration to the USISCs Plan 2A Modified and Comsat's No New Cablesplans. The USISCs subsequently changed the routing of Plan 2A Modifiedand redesignated it as ``Plan 2A Modified, as amended''. Following commentsby the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the Commonwealth) which urged the inclusionof Puerto Rico via an additional fiber optic cable connecting Puerto Ricoto the U.S. Mainland, the Commission requested additional comments fromATandamp;T and others concerning the feasibility of this proposal.3. On July 16, 1987, additional comments were sought in response to theFurther Planning Update submitted by ATandamp;T which proposed to includePuerto Rico in the Transcaribbean cable. This configuration would use thecapacity of the Florico-2 fiber optic cable to link Puerto Rico to theU.S. Mainland and then extend to the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Colombia.4. In evaluating plans concerning the possible construction of a Transcaribbeancable, we applied the criteria enumerated in our NPRM: forecasted demandand demand flexibility for the Carribean region during the planning period;the need for media and route diversity; restoration capabilities; the introductionof digital optical fiber technology and the attendant benefits of intermodaland intramodal competition; the costs of the proposed alternative plans;and foreign correspondents' acceptance. 5. We find that the USISC's Revised TCS-1 Plan, which proposes the constructionof a Transcarribbean Cable system in 1989, linking Florida, Puerto Rico,the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Colombia, the most acceptable plan.It will introduce new digital fiber optic cable technology to the regionfor the first time and will maintain media and route diversity, enhancerestoration options, be consistent with national security considerations,promote intramodal and intermodal competition, and enable Puerto Rico toconnect the U.S. mainland and other points in the Caribbean region. Thisplan also has the approval of the carriers' foreign correspondents. 6. The Transcarribbean cable will allow growth traffic to cable as wellas satellite media. The cable will establish for the first time a meaningfullevel of media diversity on the United States-Colombia route. Constructionof the Transcaribbean Cable will also provide direct media diversity toColombia, one of the larger traffic routes in the Carribean area. 7. It will also extend the benefits of digital optical fiber submarinecable technology to Haiti, Antigua, Barbados, Dominica, the French Antilles,Grenada, Guyana, Montserrat, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, Tortola, Trinidad andSt. Vincent through the extension of circuits in the cable by digital microwavesystems. It will promote technological development for the region and enhancecustomer choice. The Transcarribbean cable will provide the region withterrestrial digital communication with other parts of the world throughconnections with digital optical fiber cables in the Atlantic and PacificOcean regions. 8. Attendant with the introduction of new technology are the benefits ofintermodal and intramodal competition. In the Carribbean region, accessto digital cable facilities could increase intermodal competition, promoteefficiency, and create a downward pressure on rates. Intramodal competitionwill be increased because those carriers desiring cable circuits but presentlyunable to obtain them will have them available for use. It will also improveintermodal competition to those points by permitting services now providedexclusively by satellite to be provided by cable as well. We also believethat intramodal competition in the Carribean region will be increased withthe introduction of the Transcaribbean cable, since those carriers desiringnew digital cables, rather than the existing analog cables, will have themavailable for use. 9. We do not reach any conclusion as to cost benefits associated with theseplans because their costing methodologies and the support data are vastlydifferent, rendering a comparison meaningless. Further, we postpone considerationof the Central America cable to a later portion of this proceeding. Finally,because the Commission is developing post-1988 circuit distribution guidelineson a wordwide, rather than region-by-region basis, we will resolve thatissue in the circuit distribution proceeding, CC Docket No. 87-67. Notwithstandingthe Commonwealth's reservations, we conclude that construction of the Transcarribbeancable is consistent with our policy in promoting global telecommunicationsthrough international cooperation and comity. 10. The action contained herein has been analyzed with respect to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 and found to impose no new or modified informationcollection requirements on the public. Implementation of any new or modifiedrequirements will be subject to approval by the Office of Management andBudget as prescribed by the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Ordering Clauses </ITAG>11. According, it is ordered, pursuant to sections 4(i), 4(j), 201-205,214, and 403 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i),154(j), 201-205, 214, 403 (1976) that we adopt the following policy guidelinesfor the Carribbean Ocean Region: (1) We find that a Transcaribbean submarine fiber optic cable, RevisedTCS-1, as described in the Further Planning Update with a ready for servicedate as early as the fourth quarter of 1989 is in the public interest.(2) We defer consideration of the Central American Cable to a future phaseof this proceeding. 12. Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.605, it is ordered, that sections 603 and 604 of the Act do not apply becausethe policy guidelines adopted herein is a rule of particular applicabilityand economic impact on ATandamp;T and other members of USISCs who are notsmall entities, and is, hence, not subject to the Regulatory FlexibilityAct. 13. It is further orded that CC Docket 83-525 remains open for additionalproceedings upon further order of the Commission. 14. It is further ordered that the Secretary of the Commission shall causea summary of this Report and Order to be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and shall mail a copy of this decision to theChief for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration.<ITAG tagnum="20">Federal Communications Commission </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">H.
