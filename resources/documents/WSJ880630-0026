The biotechnology concern said that under the plan, one preferred stock purchase right will be distributed as a dividend for each share of common held at the close of business July 13. Each right, exercisable under certain conditions, will entitle common shareholders to buy one one-hundredth of a share of newly issued preferred stock at an exercise price of $95 per right.    Under certain conditions after a takeover, each right would entitle its holder to purchase common stock in the acquiring company equal to the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the market value of the acquiring company's common shares, Genetics Institute said.    Genetics Institute said the rights will expire on July 13, 1998 unless redeemed or exchanged at an earlier date.    A Genetics Institute spokesman said that no offers for the company are outstanding. </TEXT></DOC>
