The survivor brought to the surface late Friday was taken to ahospital in Dipalog, about 450 miles southeast of Manila. His leftleg was so badly injured that doctors had to amputate it, anofficial said. The survivor was not identified.   Benito Tolentino, mayor of the town of Sibutad, told reportersthat the cave-in occurred in a network of tunnels on the slopes ofMount Lablab after two days of heavy rain softened the soil.   He said 28 people were working in the area, which is below a45-foot-deep shaft, when the surface collapsed.   Tolentino said rescuers in Sibutad, about 30 miles from Dipalog,were armed only with picks and shovels and were having difficultyreaching the trapped miners.   He said there was little hope that any of them were still alive.   Tolentino ordered a temporary halt to any more gold prospectingat the site.   About 20,000 prospectors from different parts of Mindanao islandhave converged on the mountainside since gold was discovered lastSeptember, Tolentino said.   He said at least 12 people had been killed in previous cave-ins.   As in many other ``gold rush'' areas on Mindanao, prospectorsoften burrow into mountains without any professional supervision.Authorities in Manila estimate that hundreds of people have beenkilled in such cave-ins, with many of them unreported.   Armed only with picks and shovels, the miners dig deep into theearth and haul dirt out in bags. Other workers then sift goldnuggets and gold dust by washing off the dirt in streams usingwooden pans.</TEXT></DOC>
