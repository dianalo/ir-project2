Due to the high flexibilityof the SIS accelerator the medical program can be performed in additionto the planned physical experiments with minor interference only. Theclose geographical proximity of the three institutes involved and theaccelerator which will be completed by the end of 1989 provide the uniqueopportunity to carry out relevant clinical, medical-physical, physical-technical,and radiobiological research in a relatively short time and, comparedto similar projects in other countries, at low cost.</TEXT></DOC>
