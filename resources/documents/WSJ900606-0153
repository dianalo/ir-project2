Based on preliminary tests over the past year, the newbromine-free agents cause &quot;zero to extremely low&quot; ozonedepletion, said Donald P. Dunn, a Du Pont marketing manager.Halons, which can do severe damage, are being phased out byinternational agreements that call for a production freeze by1992.</LP><TEXT>   Du Pont, a chemicals and energy company, currently sellsabout $8 million to $10 million a year of fireextinguishants. The world-wide market is about $80 million.Du Pont's new products could be used in aircraft, ships,computer rooms, museums, hospitals and petroleum-productionfacilities, Mr. Dunn said.   Du Pont has invested more than $170 million on researchinto alternatives to chlorofluorocarbons and Halons, whichare both substances widely blamed for damaging the ozonelayer. Du Pont is concentrating on substitutes made up ofhydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons, orHCFCs.   By excluding the bromine compound, the active agent inHalon, Du Pont's new products are safer for the environment,Mr. Dunn said. But he added that they would be two to threetimes more expensive, and would require using more volume forcomparable effectiveness.   Du Pont's products will be produced commercially at itsMaitland, Ontario, facility and in small quantities at apilot facility in Deepwater, N.J.   Approval of the products are subject to separateapplications and standards testing by the U.S. Army, AirForce and Navy, as well as the National Fire ProtectionAssociation. Mr. Dunn said the company expects to market theproducts commercially beginning in 1995.   Du Pont's main competitors in manufacturing fireextinguishants are Imperial Chemical Industries PLC inBritain and Atochem in France as well as Great Lakes ChemicalCo. and several smaller companies in the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
