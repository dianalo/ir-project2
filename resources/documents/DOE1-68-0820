HE Hisham Nazer,the Saudi Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, confirmed recentlythat; Saudi Arabia follows a moderate oil policy; it does not allow pricereductions to go too low, nor increase prices in a way that will causeconsumer countries to consider oil substitutes. Former Saudi ArabianOil Minister, Ahmed Zaki Yamani, had already stated his country's determinationto keep oil prices steady, a decision that has stuck. Yamani indicatedthat because export volumes and the real price of oil were expected tofall during the 1980s, OPEC's share of world exports would decline fromits peak of 1980. The oil price decline in real terms has a number ofimplications for the West. Inflationary pressures will be lower; revenuesfrom the domestic US oil windfall profits tax will be lower; the gapbetween the controlled price of natural gas and oil could be narrowed,lessening the financial effects on gas users of decontrolling naturalgas; the cost of putting oil in the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve wouldbe reduced; and the US Government might have to decide whether or notto allow oil dependence on vulnerable Gulf supplies to increase to itsearlier level. The energy-security problem still exists. 24 references.</TEXT></DOC>
