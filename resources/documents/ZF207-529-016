Venus always played a strategic role in Vice.andP;  It still plays astrategic role in AFS, but now it goes by a name more functional, if lessseductive: the cache manager.andP;  Likewise, Virtue is now just referred to asAndrew's user interface.andP;  So we'll be talking about AFS, the cache manager,and the user interface throughout this article, not Vice, Venus, and Virtue.andO;The Toolkit The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is an object-oriented, windowbasedenvironment for developing applications with flexible user interfaces.andP;  It'sintended to let developers take advantage of the graphics capabilities ofworkstations.andP;  And that it does.andP;  ATK includes a set of sophisticatedcomponents, such as multifont text, raster images, and even animation (albeitsimple animation).andM;The toolkit is extendible.andP;  Developers can create new objects that pop intothose that already exist.andP;  Likewise, they can embed existing objects tocreate new applications without a detailed knowledge of what's beingembedded.andM;Two window systems are supported by ATK: X.11 and the original Andrew windowsystem with tiled windows.andP;  But ATK is easily ported to others (an OS/2 andPresentation Manager port are rumored to be in the works).andP;  Actually, it isconceptually window-system independent and, for that matter, operating-systemindependent.andP;  That way, applications are consistent, no matter what they'rerunning on.andM;The ITC has also implemented a well-defined ASCII data stream for objects sothat they can be saved as files and-this is a biggie-transmitted through themail.andP;  Andrew's message system uses this ability for its multimedia mail.andO;IMPLICATIONS.andP;  Clearly, IBM and the ITC have commercial hopes for ATK.andP;  It'sstill considered an experimental technology, but that doesn't mean it won'timpact the commercial market.andP;  Vendors may not be banging down doors tryingto get it, but they are excited about it.andM;The Open Software Foundation (OSF) is courting the idea of including ATK, inits research program.andP;  The toolkit would serve as a research vehicle for thedevelopment of future commercial systems.andP;  To OSF, the ITC fins the familiaruniversity role of developer and forecaster in the evolution of newtechnology from which the vendor community can learn.andP;  OSF anticipates thatparts of ATK will be absorbed into the commercial market-particularly itsmultimedia capabilities and its ability to transmit live objects (e.g., whenyou send a document to somebody, you transmit not just the page, but theunderlying structure, too).andP;  While we've begun to see products with multi-media elements (e.g., IBM's MO:DCA and Digital's CDA), a set of interchangestandards needs to evolve before we'll see live objects being zapped throughmany message systems (see &quot;Life for Compound Documents in a MultivendorWorld,&quot; page 6).andP;  Funding from OSF would go into distribution and support ofATK or into providing it to OSF members.andP;  Meanwhile, the toolkit is availableon NET's X tape with the same licensing status as X-Window.andP;  OBJECTS ASBUILDING BLOCKS.andP;  The Andrew Toolkit is a framework for building andcombining objects.andP;  It has an embedded structure that, in addition to a setof basic components such as buttons, sliders, and composition components,includes six higher-level components: multifont text, tables (spreadsheets),equations, drawings, rasters, and animation.andP;  These can be embedded into eachother in an assortment of combinations.andP;  It's a little like the picture onthe Morton Salt box: a girl carrying a Morton Salt box that shows a pictureof a girl carrying a Morton Salt box, and so on.andP;  With ATK, you can create atable object that contains a text object that contains an image object...andO;(you get the picture).andM;ATK objects are cooperative.andP;  The toolkit is based on a minimal protocol thatlets objects talk to each other about user interface issues, so developerscan devote themselves to the actual interaction between objects.andP;  EXTENDINGTHE TOOLKIT.andP;  At the heart of ATK is the Andrew Class System (Class), whichinvests the toolkit with its object-oriented, embedded nature.andP;  Herein liesATK's extendibility.andP;  Class has a dynamic load-and-link facility that allowsdevelopers to build new objects out of existing ones.andP;  Objects are strungtogether instead of being rebuilt.andP;  In addition, the ITC has come up with aninterpretive language called &quot;Ness&quot; that lets even patient nontechies extendthe toolkit without using C code.andP;  And that's the point.andP;  The ITC didn't wantto be at the beck and call of every department at CMU.andP;  If a member of themechanical engineering department wants to include circuit diagrams in anobject, he can do it himself.andM;The Class System is a C-based, object-oriented preprocessor.andP;  It's modeledafter C++.andP;  Apparently, C++ didn't quite offer the capabilities the ITC waslooking for, like dynamic loading and sufficient object/ source similarity tomake debugging easy.andP;  Besides, C++ requires a licensing agreement, and theITC didn't want to develop a product that required another licensed product.andM;With Class, The ITC has concocted a number of features for Andrew's userinterface.andP;  Andrew's multimedia editor, for one, was built using the dynamicload facility.andP;  It's actually a meta-editor and loads the appropriate objecteditor code when needed.andP;  When a music component, for instance, is embeddedinto text, it is dynamically loaded into the application, and the user isvirtually unaware that the music component was not part of the originaleditor.andP;  The Class system also had a hand in other Andrew interfaceapplications, such as the Help system (Andrew offers both context-sensitiveHelp and a general Help index); a console, or status window, that displaysthings like date and time, CPU load, mail notification, and file systeminformation; and the Andrew message system.andP;  POINT OF VIEW.andP;  ATK offersdevelopers some versatility by providing the ability to have multiple,simultaneous views of a single object.andP;  For instance, you can look at asingle text object as a document, an outline, or a table of contents.andP;  Youcan even have two views of one object in a single window.andP;  Tables and chartsare the obvious examples here.andP;  When you tinker with a spreadsheet, you canhave a corresponding chart view that automadcally reflects your changes.andM;This multiple-view scenario calls for a special design.andP;  There must bemultiple ways to present a component with the same underlying data.andP;  To dothis, ATK separates components into data objects and views.andP;  The data objectcontains the actual information (e.g., the very characters) of an object,while the view contains information about how the data is displayed and howthe  user manipulates it.andM;Separating the data from the view allows data objects to be used differentlyfrom the way they were originally conceived.andP;  Developers can create new viewsof existing data objects, and existing data objects can be used as buildingblocks for more complex objects.andP;  The View Tree.andP;  An ATK component relies onits relationships to other components, both the ones it contains and the onesthat contain iL The toolkit structures these relationships in a view tree.andO;At the top of the tree is the interaction manager, which can have a long lineof descendants.andP;  It all depends on the depth of the object in question.andP;  Youcan consider the tree as a chain of responsibility, and the interactionmanager as a delegator.andP;  The interaction manager never deals with an eventitself, it merely accepts events (e.g., keystrokes or mouse clicks), thenpasses them off to the child view.andP;  Me child view may be able to process anevent itself.andP;  If not, it passes the event down to one of its own children,which may hand it down further.andM;Here's a scenario: Someone is manipulating an image that's contained in atext object that also contains a table.andP;  The interaction manager says, &quot;Aha!andO;Data is being manipulated in that text object; its view needs changing,&quot; andalerts its child, the text view.andP;  The text view, in turn, looks at its twochildren, the table view and the image view, and decides to let the imageview process the event.andP;  The Graphics Layer.andP;  The ITC created a separateobject that provides the graphic interface for views.andP;  It also provides awindow system-independent layer and default printer support.andP;  However, thecurrent graphics layer won't let you get to the underlying window system.andO;APPLICATIONS.andP;  We thought it a good idea to give you a peek at the kinds ofapplications ATK produces.andP;  The ITC seemed particularly proud of the creationof a piano, which was built with sub-objects such as switches, sliders,buttons, and text.andP;  On screen, it looks like a scale of piano keys.andP;  As youslide the mouse pointer over the keys, they'll make music.andP;  The pianocaptures the notes of any tune you might compose and replays it at yourbidding.andP;  Or you can put it in another application, or even send the pianoand tune electronically to be modified by someone else.andP;  (The piano is postedon a CMU bulletin board.) Pretty neat, huh?andM;On the more practical side are the user interface tools (some of which we'vealready mentioned, such as the editor).andP;  Among them is an experimental Unixshell called &quot;Bush&quot; that gives you a tree-like view of Unix directorystructures.andM;The applications aren't all ITC-developed.andP;  For instance, members of thehistory department came up with a program that contains loads of historicaldata and various ways of viewing it.andP;  You can, for example, look u theteen-age, female popu-  lation of Cork, Ireland, before the potato famine.andO;Once you get it, you can view the demography on a map: scale it, size it,zoom in, and compare it to the demography after the famine.andP;  The File SystemWhen CMU started the Andrew project, the campus had lots of computing goingon with different machines and an incredible need for communication (soundfamiliar?).andP;  Thus, the Andrew File System (AFS) was designed to support anumber of diverse machines on a single file system.andM;To the user, AFS looks a lot like the Unix file system.andP;  It also attachessimpler file systems for simpler machines (like Macintoshes or PCs); tothese, AFS looks like an extension of the native system.andP;  The user views thesame set of files no matter what machine he or she is working on - the MicroVax on the desk or the RT down the hall.andP;  AFS is a single shared filetree that is distributed across a group of servers.andP;  But the user is sparedthe intricacies of its distributed implementation (e.g., the user doesn'thave to keep track of file locations).andM;The AFS network is based on TCP/IP and made up of Ethernets and Token-Ringstied together by bridges.andP;  Although other protocols are used on variousnetwork segments at CMU, the routers operate at the IP packet level.andP;  Anyworkstation on the network has direct access to AFS.andP;  Lower-powered machines,such as PCs and dumb terminals, hook up to the system via a set of machinescalled Unix servers, which are reserved explicitly for this task.andP;  THEDESIGN.andP;  Crucial to AFS is workstation-caching.andP;  When you retrieve a filefrom the server, it is cached--in its entirety - on your hard disk.andP;  If youfind yourself with a huge file, AFS will automatically read it in chunks.andO;This disk-caching principle sets AFS apart from the usual record-basedschemes.andP;  File server trallic is reduced because, since users have most oftheir data cached locally, they don't have to keep nagging the central filesystem.andP;  Furthermore, the design gives the computer on your desk a highdegree of autonomy because files are cached and reused locally.andM;But not if you have a diskless computer on your desk.andP;  AFS doesn't supportdiskless machines, and lots of networked computer users in the corporateworld have them.andP;  This will be a stumbling block in AFS's route to commercialviability.andM;At CMU, AFS is distributed among approximately 30 servers with about 1,000client machines.andP;  The servers are relatively small: Sun3/ 260s and RTs.andP;  Eachis equipped with three to six 400-megabyte disks.andP;  The distributed,small-server design has advantages for theandM;university's      computingandM;needs: It's easily expandable; it's dependable (a single server might crash,but it won't allect the others); and it simplifies the development process byusing the same hardware and operating system as the workstations.andP;  However,no one is dismissing the use of larger, more centrlized servers.andP;  In fact,AFS is being adapted for the MVS operating system (see  CommercialAspirations&quot; below).andP;  Communication.andP;  AFS uses remote procedure calls (RPCS)for all interprocess communications.andP;  The RPC mechanism, called Rx, usesstreams to transfer entire files and 64KB file chunks between file serversand workstations.andP;  CACHE CONSISTENCY.andP;  AFS's cache-based, distributed designdemands a solid, file-consistency solution.andP;  Again, AFS developers wereconcerned with reducing server and network loads.andP;  To do this, the systemuses callbacks.andP;  Instead of constant version-checking messages being sent tothe server, the server lets you know when a cached file has been modified.andO;AFS offers open/close granularity for shared files.andP;  So a user on oneworkstation doesn't see the changes written at another workstation until theother file is closed and an open system call is executed.andM;As far as overwriting files goes, you're working with Unix; the last writerwins.andP;  However, file locks are available to keep disreputable (or just plainhalf-witted) coworkers from overwriting files.andP;  CACHE MANAGER.andP;  The Andrewcache manager, the crux of AFS/client activities, lives on clientworkstations and interfaces to the Unix kernel via Sun's vnode interface.andO;Basically, the cache manager is in charge of finding and retrieving filesfrom the server.andP;  Thus, users don't need to know the location of a file; theyjust need to ask for it.andP;  The cache manager takes care of servercommunications and stores the file locally.andP;  Likewise, it routes updatedfiles back to the server.andM;The cache manager recognizes a file on servers by its fid (file identifier)and version number.andP;  In order to cut down on processor time, Andrewdevelopers decided to free file servers from translating pathnames to fids.andO;Instead, the cache manager keeps track of pathnames.andP;  Additionalresponsibilities of the cache manager include: * Keeping copies of recentlyused files on the local disk * Reproducing Unix system-call semantics *Freeing cache space when it becomes full * Performing RPCs to the fileservers * Caching directories and file status information * Maintaining userauthentication tickets (see &quot;Security&quot; be-  low) * Keeping track of theuser's various IDs (see &quot;Wide Area File  System&quot; below) SECURITY.andP;  Securityis a critical issue at CMU.andP;  You can't really trust your workstation especially in a university setting where, more often than not, you're sharingit).andP;  Furthermore, a good many workstations and PCs at CMU have access to thenetwork, so sending passwords over the network wasn't an option.andO;Authentication.andP;  The ITC scrapped its original authentication system andadopted one produced at NUT called Kerberos (developed for Project Athena).andO;In essence, the system won't recognize you unless you answer its encryptedmessage.andP;  (The  messages, incidentally, are unique.andP;  They're neverrepeated-an added measure against would-be data thieves.) Once you answer,the system checks your identification and hands off a ticket to the cachemanager, which provides access to the system for 25 hours.andP;  After that, youlog in again.andP;  Access Lists.andP;  AFS uses access control lists to specify theclass of operation for each user (or group of users).andP;  The seven classes are:read, write, insert, delete, lookup, lock, and administer (i.e., change theaccess list).andP;  LOGICAL VOLUMES.andP;  To make fife easier for the systemsadministrator, AFS groups files into &quot;logical volumes.&quot;andP;  Typically, a volumewould be a single user's files (although the end user is really not aware ofit).andP;  That way, systems administrators deal with volumes rather than individual files for operations like backup and load-balancing between fileservers.andP;  The cache manager is responsible for gathering volumes into acoherent file tree.andP;  Clones.andP;  One luxury of distributed architectures isresiliency.andP;  It's okay if a server fails because files are copied on mulfipleservers.andP;  Read-only versions of volumes, called clones, are replicatedthroughout the Andrew file system.andP;  Clones serve a number of purposes.andP;  Forexample, new software releases are made by cloning the system binaries.andP;  AtCMU, each user's logical volume is cloned every midnight for backup the nextday.andP;  Users can find these volumes under the name &quot;OldFiles&quot;; thus, theprevious day's work is available without having to resort to backup tapes.andO;PERFORMANCE.andP;  Allow us an anecdote here.andP;  Our trip to Pittsburgh-the actualplane ride-was fun ...andP;  and revealing.andP;  One mention of the word &quot;Andrew&quot; tothe passenger in the window seat, and the whole planeful of passengers (well,okay, maybe just the first four rows or so) was buzzing about it.andP;  Anybodyeven remotely connected with CMU (even someone associated with Pitt) hadheard of Andrew and had something to say about it-good and bad.andP;  We wereintrigued.andP;  Anything that generated so much energy must be worthwhile.andM;One grievance repeated now and again during the flight was that Andrew wasslow, especially at peak hours-say between 1:00 and 2:00 p.m.andP;  Well, wedidn't see any applications until about 4:00, but, yes, the system wassluggish.andP;  Caching puts reins on network congestion, but there will still beperiods of heavy trallic on a system that supports 1,000 client machines on avery large number of internetworked LANS.andP;  WIDE AREA FILE SYSTEM.andP;  The ITC isin the midst of an AFS-based, wide-area file system experiment.andP;  A wide areafile system is just what it sounds like: a large-scale, shared, distributedfile system.andP;  It's intended to let individual organizations share files whileletting them also maintain independent control and data protection.andO;Transparency is the goal.andP;  Ideally, you could be in New Jersey sharing fileswith a site in Montana (or even Hawaii, for that matter), and be completelyoblivious to the network's existence.andP;  In other words, it isn't necessary toexplicitly name the computer on which a particular file is stored (as it iswith DECnet, for instance).andM;A wide area file system seems a logical next step from the advances that havebeen made in distributed network computing (DNC) and single-organizationsystems (such as NFS, Locus, DS, and, obviously, AFS).andP;  It's also a naturalextension of the network services around today, such as remote login, filetransfer, and E-mail.andM;The project has two main purposes: to determine the advantages of a wide areafile system over existing network services and to put the power of AFS to thetest.andP;  We're talking about a system that is capable of supporting thousandsof workstations across thousands of miles.andP;  In the end, the ITC expects asmany as 20 sites will be using the file system.andP;  Right now, there are half adozen experimental sites: Dartmouth, the National Institutes of Health, Mt.andO;Xinu (Berkeley, California), NET, the University of Michigan, and CMU.andO;Implementation.andP;  The system is AFS.andP;  It has everything we've been describing:caches, callbacks, logical volumes, access control lists-you name it.andP;  Thewide area AFS is a connection of cooperative cells.andP;  (Cells are groups offile servers and clients).andP;  The cache manager knows which volumes belong towhich cell.andP;  It also remembers all the user's IDs (which may vary accordingto cell) and gives the user appropriate connections.andP;  As long as the user haspermission, a workstation in one cell can access files-climb the file tree,so to speak-of another (see illustration).andM;The system inherently requires a speedy WAN.andP;  NSFNet is the backbone, whichruns at 1.5 Mbps, and RPCs should also speed things up.andP;  Speed will be anissue.andP;  AFS is already fairly slow at fetching files from servers.andP;  Ifretrieving a remote file is annoyingly delayed, no one will bother.andO;COMMERCIAL ASPIRATIONS.andP;  IBM would certainly like to make a product out ofAFS, which isn't to say that the company has no other options.andP;  IBM supportsSun's NFS (Network File System) and its own DS (Distributed Services) system.andO;DS is impressive (see Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  4), but it's proprietary (at least at themoment.andP;  OSF could make it part of its operating system).andP;  NFS is open, butit belongs to Sun.andP;  Enter AFS.andP;  It's open, it has benefits over NFS (e.g.,andO;the AFS authentication and disk-caching mechanisms), and IBM can leverage itas an IBM product.andP;  AIX will be the next implementation.andM;An MVS version is also in the offing.andP;  Granted, we've been talking a lotabout AFS's distributed nature.andP;  But there's no reason its caching andcallback mechanisms can't be applied to big, centralized machines.andP;  In fact,that's how it's being implemented for a project at the University ofMichigan.andP;  UM plans on using 3090 mainframe servers to create a system thatsupports 30,000 workstations.andP;  How well will a Unix-conceived file systemadapt to MVS systems? The environments are worlds apart.andP;  We'll wait and see.andO;In Light of NFS.andP;  The basic premises behind AFS and NFS don't exactly mesh.andO;The goal of AFS is to reduce communication, which must seem almostsacrilegious to a company that advertises &quot;the network is the computer.&quot; AHthe same, NFS is the de facto standard, and Andrew developers aren't ignoringit.andM;The AFS cache manager can coexist with an NFS implementation so workstationscan access both NFS and AFS servers.andP;  Additionally, the CMU computer sciencedepartment has written a server that exports AFS files using NFS protocols.andO;Thus, NFS clients can have wide area file service via an intermethate machinein their LAN (although the security provided in this scenario will be theleast common denominator).andM;But NFS isn't the only file system out there.andP;  Somewhere down the line, theITC would like to construct an export server to let arbitrary distributedfile systems export files to AFS.andP;  Multimedia Messages The Andrew MessageSystem (AMS), an end-user application, the fruit of the Andrew toolkit andfile system, is definitely not your average E-mail.andP;  Users can send evencomplex compound documents-with all the elements that distinguish thetoolkit-electronically.andP;  How much of that document gets lost in transi- tiondepends on the sophistication of the machine at the other end.andP;  If you'resending it to another workstation, it's great.andP;  The document actually stayslive.andP;  When you send it to a text-only destination, AMS creates a no-frillsversion with text descriptions of the other media elements (see illustrationbelow).andM;AMS also supports multimedia bulletin boards.andP;  At CMU, it supports over 1,800bulletin boards, including netnews, the Dow Jones information servicebroadtape, and all sorts of messages (fun, informational, off-beat) from theuser community.andP;  Bulletin board magazines can be set up to weed out thetangle of bulletin board messages on specific topics.andP;  The mail and bulletinboards share a common interface.andP;  A user who wants to keep a message from abulletin board simply puts it in his or her own mail folder.andP;  AMS STRUCTURE.andO;The Andrew file system and toolkit both shaped the design of AMS.andP;  Withoutthe toolkit, the system simply wouldn't generate multimedia messages.andP;  Butthose multimedia messages take up a lot of room.andP;  The message databases ofAMS are hefty (gigabytes of message text), but the distributed file systemaccommodates them and simplifies accessing them.andP;  ne message database is inone place-the file system.andP;  Furthermore, AFS's authentication feature combatsmessage forgeries and permits private bulletin boards and shared mailboxes.andM;AMS is divided into three layers of functionality: the application layer, theclient library layer, and the message server layer.andP;  Users deal only with AMSat the application level; client library and message server activities takeplace in the background.andP;  Application Layer.andP;  The application layer is usedto create and retrieve mail messages.andP;  The interface of mail applicationsvaries (naturally) according to machine type.andP;  AMS has three user interfacelevels.andP;  The most basic, CUI (common user interface), doesn't requireanything more sophisticated than a teletype display.andP;  Visual user interface(VUI) is a notch above that-at PC level.andP;  Andrew's fancy multimediainterface, called Messages, is confined to workstations.andP;  CUI Library.andP;  Theclient library, or CUI library, is the middleman between the application andthe message server.andP;  It implements various abstractions of client interfacesas well as communications with the message server.andP;  It's written in C andruns in Unix, VMS, DOS, and Macintosh.andP;  Message Server.andP;  The message serveractually accesses the message database (which is stored in AFS and holds allAMS messages and bulletin boards).andP;  Clients access the message server via anRPC called SNAP.andP;  DELIVERY SYSTEM.andP;  The delivery system, logically, sendsmail  messages.andP;  Originally, the ITC hoped to simply use the standardBerkeley sendmail program, but the characteristics of AFS got in the way.andO;Therefore, the AMS delivery system was entirely rewritten to take advantageof the file system's authentication system, its support of non-Unix machines,and its distributed nature.andM;Aside from the fact that it copes with AFS, the AMS delivery system has otheradvantages over standard Unix systems.andP;  For instance, it provides locationindependence.andP;  Senders don't have to know machine locations, just usernames-and they don't even need to be sure of those.andP;  The delivery system hasa user name look-up facility called &quot;white pages&quot; that makes allowances formisspelled names.andP;  So if you're not sure how to spell the name &quot;Breitmeyer,&quot;the system will come up with some probabilities.andP;  The white pages database isstored in AFS and is accessed by the message server, which, in turn, exportsit to the client interface.andP;  Commercial Ramifications: What Can We Learn? Forstarters, we know we need industry standards that will achieve the same goalsas the Expres project: the exchange of processable objects among dissimilarhardware and software environments.andP;  The industry is starting to put outcompound document/object architectures, but can they be transmitted amongvarious systems? Nope.andP;  Before long, users will demand a common mechanism forexchange.andM;Interoperability is also a plug for the Andrew file system.andP;  Very well, Sun'sNFS is open, too, and it's also the industry standard.andP;  But even Sun couldlearn a trick or two from AFS.andP;  AFS's disk-caching scheme makes the system afar better network decongestant than NFS.andP;  AFS's logical volumes also makethings easier for administrators to configure and recon- figure the system.andO;Moreover, AFS's authentication system provides better security than NFS,which depends on Unix access rights.andM;The commercial world will also be eyeing this year's AFS projects, namely thewide area file system and the MVS port.andM;The toolkit may be Andrew's first direct impact on the marketplace.andO;Recently, there's been a lot of hoopla surrounding user interfaces.andO;Tomorrow's standard user interface will be like Andrew's: graphical andobject oriented.andP;  The recent spurt of compound document/object architecturesand applications with graphical user interfaces makes the Andrew toolkit seemparticularly pertinent-especially for the proliferation of Unix.andP;  The ITCmaintains that, if Unix is to gain an edge on the PC world, it needs toprovide a higher-quality user interface than PCs do.andP;  Furthermore, it needsto coexist with the office environments already in place.andP;  PCs andMacintoshes aren't going anywhere.andP;  The toolkit's flexibility in regard towindow and operating-system independence can help bridge that PC/Unix gap.andO;Life for Compound Documents in a Multivendor WorldandM;THINK FOR A MINUTE about the concept of a living document-not merely acompound document, mind you, but a compound document that keeps itsfunctionality even when it's sent across a multivendor system.andP;  Interestingprospect.andP;  In it is the idea of compound documents as works in progress.andO;When you're working on an important business report, you usually go through afew stages: gathering information, collaborating ideas with other people,getting the report reviewed and approved, revising it, prettying it up, etc.andO;As compound documents and computer-supported cooperative work continue toflourish, users will want to exchange multimedia objects, even among diverse systems.andP;  YOU CAN'T GET EVERYTHING YOU WANT.andP;  However, the industry isn'tready to accommodate those users.andP;  In its way is a lack of standards.andP;  ODA isone of the industry's most promising vehicles for compound document exchange,but, as yet, it's not suitable.andP;  ODA supports only a subset of functionalityfor most compound document/object architectures.andP;  For instance, it doesn'thandle spreadsheets or equations, and its style-sheet mechanism isn't asflexible as it could be.andP;  LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS: THE EXPRES PROJECT.andP;  In1986, the National Science Foundation (NSF) began the Expres project, whichsought to enable the exchange of complex information across multivendorsystems.andP;  The players: the Andrew system at Carnegie-Mellon's InformationTechnology Center and the Diamond system at the University of Michigan (UM).andO;(The Diamond system was developed by BBN Systems and Technologies and is nowmarketed under the name &quot;Slate.&quot; For a review, see Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  8.) Andrewand Diamond generate similar-looking compound documents, but their underlyingstructures don't come close.andP;  Hence, the universities began work on a commonexchange solution.andP;  The ODA Toolkit.andP;  A by-product of Expres is the ODAtoolkit.andP;  Despite its limitations, UM and CMU have a lot of faith in ODA'slayout semantics.andP;  (Cited as a major drawback is ODA's weak style-sheetdevice.andP;  Hopefully, the work going on with the toolkit will catalyze someimprovements there.)andM;The toolkit makes it easier to work with ODA by providing amachine-independent collection of functions for conversion.andP;  Translators mapspecific document representations to and from ODA, which becomes anintermediate format.andP;  So, if you're sending a Diamond document (.DMD) to anAndrew (.ATK) user, it's converted first to ODA, and then from ODA to ATK.andO;Some attributes are slightly readjusted in the process (ODA is less flexiblethan either .DMD or.ATK).andP;  So far, the toolkit has been used to convertInterleaf, troff, Diamond, and Andrew documents.andP;  It will be interesting tosee exactly how much information gets lost-or readjusted-once moretranslators are developed.andP;  Translation Overload.andP;  If the ODA toolkit is assuccessful as its developers hope and a whole spray of translators evolve,what might happen to a document that's been run through several systems withvarying capabilities? Two things.andP;  One is that it will be reduced to a commondocument that all the systems could deal with.andP;  The extreme in this case ispretty bleak; the file could be reduced to nothing as each system trashes theinformation it can't support.andP;  The opposite extreme is scary, too.andP;  Thedocument could become completely overladen with redundant information.andM;Time will tell.andP;  Next Steps.andP;  The ITC would like to see the ODA toolkitbecome public domain.andP;  One result the ITC would really like is the formationof an ODA Consortium with the double purpose of continuing to extend ODA soit supports more kinds of documents and making the toolkit available toconsortium members.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
