Comments on the collection of information should bedirected to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office ofManagement and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officer forthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, with copies of such commentsto be sent to John R. Keiper, Jr., Assistant Executive Secretary, Room6108, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 550 17th Street, NW., Washington,DC 20429. The collection of information in this proposed regulation isin andSection;346.19(e)(6). This information is required by the Federal DepositInsurance Corporation to determine the type and amount of assets placedfor safekeeping at a depository, as pledged assets, by a foreign bank.This information will be used to ensure compliance with section 5 of theFederal Deposit Insurance Act and with FDIC's regulatory requirements.The likely respondents are foreign banks which have insured branches anddepositories for the pledge of assets by insured branches. <T3>Estimated Total Annual Reporting and/or Recordkeeping Burden: </T3>144hours. <T3>Estimated Average Annual Burden per Response: </T3>1 hour. <T3>Estimated Number of Responses: </T3>144. <T3>Estimated Annual Frequency of Responses: </T3>on occasion and semiannually.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>After a thorough review, under FDIC's regulatory review program, of itsregulation dealing with foreign banks, 12 CFR Part 346, the FDIC is proposingchanges to that regulation. In particular, substantial changes are proposedin regard to exemptions from the deposit insurance requirement, the currentcapital equivalency ledger account provision, and the country exposureprovision. Other changes, primarily technical, are being proposed to provisionsconcerning the pledge of assets. There are also a number of proposed miscellaneouschanges throughout the regulation. The capital equivalency ledger account provision would be changed substantially.The current provision would be eliminated, and the title used previouslyin the regulation, <T3>i.e., </T3>``asset maintenance,'' would be reinstated, with significantsubstantive changes being made in the requirements of the regulation. Inlieu of the current requirement at andSection;346.20 that head office fundsequivalent to 6% of the preceding quarter's average book value of the thirdparty liabilities of the branch be maintained, the proposal would requirethat an insured branch maintain eligible assets as determined by proposedandSection;346.20 in an amount not less than 106% of the preceding quarter'saverage book value of the branch's third party liabilities or, in the caseof a newly established branch, the average book value of the branch's estimatedliabilities for the first full quarter of operation. Assets would haveto be payable in United States dollars, or in a currency freely convertibleto United States dollars. Several changes would be made in regard to exclusionsfrom the asset base. In addition to the current exclusion from eligibilityof any asset classified ``Loss,'' assets designated ``Other Transfer RiskProblem,'' or classified ``Substandard,'' ``Doubtful,'' or ``Value Impaired''would also be excluded, as would intangible assets. The FDIC has decided to retain the requirement for daily maintenance. Domesticbanks must maintain required levels of capital on a daily basis, and thereis no compelling reason to allow for anything other than a continuous maintenanceof the required asset level for insured branches. The FDIC has, in addition,decided to retain the requirement, both here and with respect to the pledgeof assets, that there be a waiver of offset for certificates of deposit.After substantial internal study, the FDIC has determined that the requirementbenefits the FDIC and should not be dropped. It should be noted that the federal bank regulatory agencies are in theprocess of fashioning a new capital policy which is anticipated to takea risk-based approach to capital requirements. If a new capital policyis adopted the FDIC will at that time evaluate whether to apply the principlesof that policy to insured branches of foreign banks. The current restriction on country exposure at andSection;346.23 would bedeleted and the country exposure exclusion in the current capital equivalencyledger accounts would not be reflected in the proposed asset maintenancerequirement. Both in reference to the proposed asset maintenance and assetpledge provisions, however, the FDIC may require a higher ratio of eligibleassets and/or an increase in pledged assets, respectively, based on theconcentration of risk to any one borrower or group of related borrowers,or the concentration of transfer risk to any one country, including thecountry in which the branch's head office is located. The proposed changeswould occur at proposed andSection;346.19(b)(3) and proposed andSection;346.20(a).A number of additional changes are being proposed to the pledge of assetsprovision. Section 346.1(p) would state specifically that a depositorymay not be an affiliate of the foreign bank whose insured branch seeksto use that depository. Other proposed changes in andSection;346.19 relatespecifically to the pledge of assets. Throughout the provisions concerningthe pledge, either the term ``pledge'' or ``place'' would generally replacethe term ``deposit.'' Several changes would be made to andSection;346.19(b).The provision would expand on the current definition of value, requireperiodic computations only as of the last date of the second and fourthquarters, respectively, and no longer contain the statement regarding thetwo-day adjustment period, since that requirement in specified elsewherein the regulation. Proposed andSection;346.19(c) would specify that the approvalrequired for a depository to be used is prior written approval and, further,that the depository must be attorney in fact for the foreign bank for thepurpose of transferring title to pledged assets to the FDIC. In regardto the assets which may be pledged under andSection;346.19(d), language wouldbe added to indicate that any pledges are for the benefit of the FDIC orits designees and that assets must be denominated in United States dollars.Proposed andSection;346.19(d)(3) would allow the pledging of commercial paperrated P-2, as well as P-1. Changes would be made at andSection;346.19(d)(5)in regard to local government obligations. Those obligations would, underthe proposal, be required to have a credit rating within the top two ratingbands of a nationally-recognized rating service, with any conflict in theratings to be resolved in favor of the lowest rating. Proposed andSection;346.19(d)(7)would allow notes issued by U.S. banks, bank holding companies, or insuredbranches to be included as assets eligible to be pledged if those noteshave a credit rating within the top two rating bands of a nationally-recognizedrating service (with any conflict in the ratings to be resolved in favorof the lowest rating). The notes would also have to be payable in the UnitedStates and issued by other than an affiliate of the pledging foreign bank.Proposed andSection;346.19(e) would cover the original pledge, additionalrequired pledges, substitution of assets, delivery of other documents,acceptance and safekeeping by the depository, reporting requirements, accessto assets, release of assets, interest earned on assets, expenses of theagreement, substitution of the depository, and waiver of terms. The substanceof the proposed regulation is similar to that of existing andSection;346.19(e),with proposed technical changes and expansion of certain requirements.For instance, at proposed andSection;346.19(e)(6)(i)(B), the informationin a foreign bank's certification would be expanded from that in the currentregulation. The quarterly reports currently required at andSection;346.19(e)(2)(ii) and (iii) would now be semi-annual as specified in proposed andSection;346.19(e)(6)(ii).(Computation of the pledge as required at andSection;346.19(b) would be computedafter the second and fourth quarters, respectively.) Proposed andSection;346.19(e)(7)simply expands on the FDIC's right of access in order to evaluate pledgedassets. Proposed andSection;346.19(e)(10) would specify that if the foreignbank is not allowed to retain interest, the FDIC will specify the dispositionof that interest. Proposed andSection;346.19(e)(12) would deal with the substitutionof a depository and would replace the provision at current andSection;346.19(e)(10)dealing with the termination of the agreement. Major changes are being proposed in the provision relating to exemptionsfrom the deposit insurance requirement at andSection;346.6. It should benoted that the current regulation keys a number of provisions into theconcept of the acceptance of an initial deposit. Branches, especially noninsuredbranches of foreign banks, should be cautioned that they must maintainrecords which clearly establish the amount of the initial deposit, sincethat concept exists in the current regulation and continues to exist inthe proposed regulation. A change is being proposed at andSection;346.6(a)(1)which would allow exemption from deposit insurance for virtually any businessentity, regardless of any size limitations such as those which currentlyexist. Current andSection;346.6(a)(4) would be eliminated since it is a grandfatherprovision which no longer applies. The ``de minimus rule'' which currentlyexists at andSection;346.6(a)(5) would be eliminated, and a checklist ofexempt depositors would be substituted for that section. This checklist,found at proposed andSection;346.6(a)(5), allows an exemption for individualswho are not U.S. citizens but are residents in the United State if theyare employed by certain listed organizations. Proposed andSection;346.6(a)(6)is the current andSection;346.6(a)(7) and exempts individuals who are notcitizens and not residents of the U.S. at the time of the initial deposit.Other miscellaneous changes are being proposed throughout the regulation.The proposal clarifies the definition of ``foreign bank'' at andSection;346.1(a)to conform with the current state of statutory law on the subject. An attempthas been made in that definition to clarify the situation of those institutionswhich were considered to be foreign banks under the International BankingAct but are also domestic insured banks under the Federal Deposit InsuranceAct; andSection;346.21, which currently speaks to this subject, would beeliminated. Those institutions which are ``insured banks'' other than becausethey have an insured branch in this country, and which are otherwise domesticstate-chartered banks are not subject to the provisions of andSection;andSection;346.17,346.18, 346.19 or 346.20. In other words, these institutions are not subjectto the indicated provisions relating to the agreement to provide informationand to be examined, to the recordkeeping requirements, to the pledge ofassets, nor to the asset maintenance rules; however, these institutionsare subjects to other statutory and regulatory requirements by virtue oftheir being domestic insured banks. A change is proposed at andSection;346.4(b) to eliminate an outdated grandfatherprovision which allowed foreign banks establishing State branches beforeSeptember 17, 1978 to operate those branches as noninsured branches untilSeptember 16, 1979 without deposit-taking restrictions. Appendix A to Part346 is also being eliminated. The initial intent of this appendix was toprovide current lists of states which require deposit insurance as a prerequisiteto receiving a charter and of states which do not require such depositinsurance. The administrative difficulty of maintaining such lists accuratelydoes not warrant retaining the appendix. State banking departments will,of course, continue to monitor their respective requirements. Section 346.17(a)(1)would specify that information provided must be in English. Amendments to andSection;346.7, concerning notification to depositors, arealso being proposed. It is proposed that negotiable certificates of depositof more than $100,000 no longer be exempted from the requirement of eithera statement on a form evidencing a deposit or an acknowledgement by thedepositor. Experience has shown that confusion can and does exist in regardto deposits of more than $100,000. In addition, a depositor of more than$100,000 generally does expect some FDIC coverage. The provision at currentandSection;346.7(a)(2) that any State branch exempt from the insurance requirementunder andSection;346.6 would, within 30 days from the date of accepting aninitial deposit of less than $100,000, have to notify existing depositorsin writing that the branch is not insured by the FDIC is being eliminated.It is believed that although this provision was important at the time ofits adoption, the requirements for display of signs indicating that depositsare not insured and for statements on negotiable certificates of depositare sufficient to cover any likely risk of confusion to a depositor. Other technical and stylistic changes, including some clearer statementsof what party or parties at the FDIC would normally have authority to actin specific situations, would be made throughout Part 346, as well as inan amendment to andSection;303.8. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Board of Directorshereby certifies that the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. There are presently22 foreign banks which have insured branches, and they are world-wide institutionswith assets ranging from approximately $1 to 240 billion. The requirementsof 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604 that initial and final regulatory flexibility analysesbe made do not apply to this proposal since this proposed rule would notadd an economic burden to small entities. In addition, pursuant to the FDIC's statement of policy on the draftingof regulations, it has been determined that a cost-benefit analysis, includinga small bank impact statement, is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG> 12 CFR Part 303Administrative practice and procedure, Authority delegations, Bank depositinsurance, Banks, banking.12 CFR Part 346Bank deposit insurance, Foreign banks, banking, Banks, banking, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements.In consideration of the foregoing, the FDIC hereby proposes to amend Parts303 and 346 of title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 303_APPLICATIONS, REQUESTS, SUBMITTALS, DELEGATIONS OF AUTHORITY,AND NOTICES OF ACQUISITION OF CONTROL</ITAG>1.

Section 346.20 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 346.20</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Asset maintenance.</ITAG>(a) An insured branch of a foreign bank shall maintain on a daily basiseligible assets in an amount not less than 106% of the preceding quarter'saverage book value of the branch's liabilities or, in the case of a newly-establishedbranch, the estimated book value of its liabilities at the end of the firstfull quarter of operation, exclusive of liabilities due to the foreignbank's head office, other branches, agencies, offices or wholly owned subsidiaries.The Director of the Division of Bank Supervision or his designee may imposea computation of total liabilities on a daily basis in those instanceswhere it is found necessary for supervisory purposes. The Board of Directorsmay require that a higher ratio of eligible assets be maintained if thefinancial condition of the branch warrants such action. Among the factorswhich will be considered in requiring a higher ratio of eligible assetsare the concentration of risk to any one borrower or group of related borrowers,or the concentration of transfer risk to any one country, including thecountry in which the foreign bank's head office is located. Eligible assetsshall be payable in United States dollars or in a currency freely convertibleinto United States dollars.(b) In determining eligible assets for the purposes of compliance withparagraph (a) the branch shall exclude the following:(1) Any asset due from the foreign bank's head office, other branches,agencies, offices or affiliates;(2) Any asset designated ``Other Transfer Risk Problem'' or classified``Substandard,'' ``Doubtful,'' ``Value Impaired,'' or ``Loss'' in the mostrecent state or federal examination report;(3) Any deposit of the branch in a bank unless the bank has executed avalid waiver of offset agreement;(4) Any asset not supported by sufficient credit information to allow areview of the asset's credit quality, as determined at the most recentstate or federal examination;\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Whether an asset has sufficient credit information willbe a function of the size of the borrower and the location within the foreignbank of the responsibility for authorizing and monitoring extensions ofcredit to the borrower. For large, well known companies, when credit responsibilityis located in an office of the foreign bank outside the insured branch,the branch must have adequate documentation to show that the asset is ofgood quality and is being supervised adequately by the bank. In such cases,copies of periodic memoranda that include an analysis of the borrower'srecent financial statements and a report on recent developments in theborrower's operations and borrowing relationships with the bank generallywould constitute sufficient information. For other borrowers, periodicmemoranda must be supplemented by information such as copies of recentfinancial statements, recent correspondence concerning the borrower's financialcondition and repayment history, credit terms and collateral, data on anyguarantors, and where necessary, the status of any corrective measuresbeing employed.<ITAG tagnum="28">Subsequent to the determination that an asset lacks sufficient creditinformation, an insured branch may not include the amount of that assetamong eligible assets until the FDIC determines that sufficient documentationexists. Such a determination may be made either at the next federal examination,or upon request of the branch, by the regional director of the FDIC regionin which the branch is located.</ITAG>(5) Any asset not in the branch's actual possession unless the branch holdstitle to such asset and the branch maintains records sufficient to enableindependent verification of the branch's ownership of the asset, as determinedat the most recent state or federal examination;(6) Any intangible asset.(c) A foreign bank which has more than one insured branch in a state maytreat all of its insured branches in the same state as one entity for purposesof compliance with paragraph (a) of this section and shall designate onebranch to be responsible for maintaining the records of the branches' compliancewith this section.(d) The average book value of the branch's liabilities for a quarter shallbe, at the branch's option, either an average of the balances as of theclose of business for each day of the quarter or an average of the balancesas of the close of business on each Wednesday during the quarter. Quartersend on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of any given year.For days on which the branch is closed, balances from the previous businessday are to be used. Calculations of the average book value of the branch'sliabilities for a quarter shall be retained by the branch until the nextfederal examination.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 346.21</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Removed and Reserved]</ITAG>13.
