The grade and size requirementsare the same as implemented last season. Olives used in limited use stylesare too small to be desirable for use as whole or pitted canned olivesbecause their flesh-to-pit ratio is too low. However, they are satisfactoryfor use in the production of products where the form of the olive is changed.Their use in such products over the years has helped the California oliveindustry meet the increasing market needs of the food service industry.The requirements for domestic olives were recommended by the CaliforniaOlive Committee, which works with the Department in administering the marketingorder program for olives grown in California. The establishment of suchrequirements for imported olives is required pursuant to section 8e ofthe Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>December 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>George J.

The order is effective under theAgricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674),hereinafter referred to as the Act.This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and DepartmentalRegulation 1512-1 and has been determined to be a ``non-major'' rule undercriteria contained therein. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has consideredthe economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesssubject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be undulyor disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to theAct, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought aboutthrough group action of essentially small entities acting on their ownbehalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.There are seven handlers of California olives subject to regulation underthe order and approximately 1,400 producers in California. Approximately25 importers of olives are subject to the olive import regulation. Smallagricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration(13 CFR 121.2) as those having annual gross revenues for the last threeyears of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are definedas those whose gross annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. Most butnot all of the olive producers and importers may be classified as smallentities. None of the olive handlers may be classified as small entities.Nearly all of the olives grown in the United States are produced in California.The growing areas are scattered throughout California with most of thecommercial production coming from inland valleys. About 75 percent of theproduction comes from the San Joaquin Valley and 25 percent from the SacramentoValley. Olive production has fluctuated from a low of 24,200 tons in the 1972-73crop year to a high of 146,500 tons in the 1982-83 crop year. Last year'sproduction totalled about 64,000 tons. The various varieties of olivesproduced in California have alternate bearing tendencies with high productionone year and low the next. The industry expects the 1988-89 crop to beabout 85,000 tons. The primary use of California olives is for canned ripe olives which areeaten out of hand as hors d'oeuvres or used as an ingredient in cooking.The canned ripe olive market is essentially a domestic market. Very fewCalifornia olives are exported. This action allows handlers to market more olives than would be permittedin the absence of this relaxation in size requirements. This additionalopportunity is provided to maximize the use of the California olive supply,facilitate market expansion, and benefit both growers and handlers. The interim rule was issued August 3, 1988, and published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 30, 1988 (53 FR 33100). That rule invitedinterested persons to submit written comments through September 29, 1988.One comment was received strongly favoring the grade and size requirementsestablished by the interim final rule.The interim rule modified andSection; 932.153 of Subpart-Rules and Regulations(7 CFR 932.108-932.161). The modification established grade and size regulationsfor 1988-89 crop limited use size olives. The modification was issued pursuantto paragraph (a)(3) of andSection; 932.52 of the order. That rule also madenecessary conforming changes in the olive import regulation (Olive Regulation1; 7 CFR 944.401). The import regulation is issued pursuant to section8e of the Act. Section 8e provides that whenever grade, size, quality,or maturity provisions are in effect for specified commodities, includingolives, under a marketing order, the same or comparable requirements mustbe imposed on the imports.Paragraph (a)(3) of andSection; 932.52 of the marketing order provides thatprocessed olives smaller than the sizes prescribed for whole and pittedstyles may be used for limited uses if recommended by the committee andapproved by the Secretary. The sizes are specified in terms of minimumweights for individual olives in various size categories. The section furtherprovides for the establishment of size tolerances.To allow handlers to take advantage of the strong market for halved, segmented,sliced, and chopped canned ripe olives, the committee recommended thatgrade and size requirements again be established for limited use olivesfor the 1988-89 crop year (August 1-July 31). The grade requirements arethe same as those applied during the 1987-88 crop year, as are the sizesand the size tolerances. Permitting handlers to use small olives in limiteduse style canned olives will have a positive impact on industry returns.In the absence of this action, the undersized fruit would have to be usedfor non-canning uses, like oil, for which returns are lower. The requirementshereinafter set forth in andSection; 932.153 are the same as those containedin the interim rule.Paragraph (b)(12) of andSection; 944.401 of the olive import regulation allowsimported bulk olives which do not meet the minimum size requirements forcanned whole and pitted ripe olives to be used for limited use styles ifthey meet specified size requirements. Continuation of the limited useauthorization for California olives by this final rule requires that similarchanges be made in paragraph (b)(12) of andSection; 944.401 to keep the importregulation in conformity with the applicable domestic requirements. Theseconforming changes will benefit importers because they will be able toimport small-sized olives for limited use during the 1988-89 season endingJuly 31, 1989.Based on the above, the Administrator of AMS has determined that this actionwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities.After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information andrecommendations submitted by the committee, and other available information,it is determined that the provisions as hereinafter set forth will tendto effectuate the declared policy of the Act.Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is found and determined that good cause existsfor not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days afterpublication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> because: (1) This action leaves in effect requirementscurrently being applied to California and imported olives under an interimrule; (2) the olive import requirements are mandatory under section 8eof the Act; (3) this action relieves restrictions on handlers and importers;(4) the interim final rule provided a 30 day period for comments, one commentwas received strongly favoring this action; and (5) no useful purpose wouldbe served by delaying the effective date of this action until 30 days afterpublication.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>7 CFR Part 932Marketing agreements and orders, Olives, California.7 CFR Part 944Food grades and standards, Fruits, Import regulations.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Parts 932 and 944 areamended as follows.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 932_OLIVES GROWN IN CALIFORNIA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 944_FRUITS; IMPORT REGULATIONS</ITAG>1.
