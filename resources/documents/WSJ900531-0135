Today, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) is scheduled to presideover a fact-finding meeting in Washington that couldeventually lead to Congress's appropriating funds to repayfirms hurt by so-called individual sureties, says an aide toSen. Hatch.</LP><TEXT>   Subcontractors and government officials will discuss withMr. Hatch surety problems they have encountered and means tohelp the victims. Some federal investigators estimate suchsureties have cheated small businesses out of tens ofmillions of dollars in the scandal.   At the same time, however, a separate effort in Congressseeks to revive the individual-surety business -- just as itis dying out in the face of tough new federal regulations.This time, fans of the measure say, small businesses will besafeguarded.   An individual surety is supposed to be a well-heeledperson who for a fee from the prime contractor providesfinancial-guarantee bonds on a government building project.If the prime contractor fails to finish the job, the suretyis supposed to step in and make sure that the work gets doneand that all the subcontractors get paid, even if some of themoney has to come from his own pocket.   Government contracting officials say the use of individualsureties grew sharply in recent years as contractors found itincreasingly difficult to get bonding from insurancecompanies.   As reported in this newspaper and elsewhere over the pastyear, the individual-surety market was invaded in recentyears by individuals whose prime asset turned out to be anability to vastly inflate their own net worth on financialstatements. Many of these bogus financial statements slippedby federal contracting officers and weren't discovered untilthe building jobs went sour and subcontractors weren't paid.   In February, federal acquisition regulations were changedto substantially toughen rules on individual sureties. Forinstance, if a surety wants to claim real estate on his networth statement, he has to prove his ownership and the valueof the property. He also must give the government a lien onthe property until the job is done, says J. William Green, aNavy contracting attorney.   Since the new regulations went into effect, &quot;the number ofcontractors using individual sureties has shrunk to almostnothing&quot; around the country, says Albert Proctor, an attorneywith the Army Corps of Engineers. Before the rule changes,some government agencies estimated that individual suretieswere appearing on more than 10% of their construction jobs.   Unfortunately, the new rules may be too effective, saysMr. Green, the Navy attorney who has been a vocal advocate oftougher individual-surety regulations. Now &quot;all thosesmall-business men who used individual sureties have a chanceto argue that they can't get any of the {governmentcontracting} action because the rules are too stringent.&quot;   Which is exactly what some businessmen and theirrepresentatives are arguing. The new individual-surety rules&quot;have had a devastating impact on our members,&quot; says RalphThomas, executive director of the National Association ofMinority Contractors, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group.   Partly because minority contractors tend to be smaller andnewer than their white counterparts, they have had a moredifficult time getting insurance-company bonding and haverelied on individual sureties, he says. Mr. Thomas estimatesthat up to 75% of his members that do government constructioncontracting have been hurt by the new rules.   In response to such complaints, Rep. Cardiss Collins, anIllinois Democrat, is sponsoring a bill to authorize a pilotproject that would allow individual sureties to formself-policing associations. These groups would ensure thatclaims against individual members got paid. Critics worrythat such a plan would simply pool bad risks and wouldn'tsignificantly reduce the risk of abuse. The House GovernmentActivities and Transportation subcommittee, which Ms. Collinschairs, has scheduled a hearing next Wednesday on theindividual-surety issue.   What makes the debate particularly vexing is that forevery contractor who has been hurt by the tough new rules,there seems to be a subcontractor hurt by the old lax rule.For example, Camilo Ramirez says he is owed over $98,000 formasonry work his small firm did in 1988 on a building projectfor the National Aeronautics and Space Administration inCalifornia. When the prime contractor failed to pay, theindividual sureties also failed to come up with the money.   The absence of that money left him unable to pay hisworkers or keep up payments on his equipment, which waseventually repossessed, says Mr. Ramirez. Creditors arehounding him for thousands of dollars of unpaid bills and hisbusiness, which he spent eight years building, is essentiallyclosed down. The financial stress contributed to the breakupof his marriage, says the 37-year-old Mr. Ramirez. &quot;This hasruined my life. I have nothing now,&quot; he adds.   He does have some unhappy company in the form of about twodozen other subcontractors who say they are owed a total of$2.8 million on the same NASA job. These firms have bandedtogether to demand the federal government pay them, andrepresentatives of some of these firms are to meet with Sen.Hatch today.   Getting Uncle Sam to pony up in such matters is a tallorder, concedes John Tacke, the subcontractors' attorney. Thegovernment aimed to keep itself out of such payment disputesby requiring sureties.   A NASA spokeswoman said the agency believes it actedproperly on the contracts.   Sen. Hatch is looking at introducing special legislationto pay these subcontractors and others &quot;who fell into the pitbefore the surety rules were changed,&quot; says Robert Lockwood,an aide to the senator. Already, he adds, more than a dozensenators have expressed interest in co-sponsoring such ameasure.</TEXT></DOC>
