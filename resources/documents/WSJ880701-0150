The disclosures in the news media, he complained, &quot;may very well jeopardize&quot; portions of his sweeping Pentagon-fraud investigation.    What angers Mr. Hudson, known as a man who likes to be in control, are disclosures that don't fit into his strategy.    Mr. Hudson, the U.S. attorney in Alexandria, Va., has vigorously urged his Justice Department superiors to put a lid on details of the case, according to law-enforcement officials. But he nevertheless is pushing for public release, probably by late this month, of government affidavits and court documents that would provide fresh details of the suspected bribery and fraud schemes. Federal Bureau of Investigation managers are reluctant to release the data, but Mr. Hudson's apparent hope is to encourage witnesses to provide more evidence.    A tenacious, single-minded approach has been the hallmark of the 40-year-old Mr. Hudson, who previously gained attention as a suburban prosecutor crusading against drug pushers, prostitutes and pornography.    Critics accuse Mr. Hudson of trying to promote himself in the Pentagon investigation by briefing lawmakers about the investigation and fighting ferociously, behind the scenes, to keep other Justice Department officials away from the case. Meanwhile, some Defense Department officials complain that they, too, are being denied access to information by the prosecutor's team.    In the interview, Mr. Hudson said that he was ordered by Attorney General Edwin Meese to brief congressional leaders about the general outlines of the investigation. But the prosecutor specifically disputed claims, made by some lawmakers and their aides after the session, that he predicted 20 or more individuals were likely to plead guilty and begin cooperating with the government in the next few months. &quot;I didn't cite any specific figures to Congress,&quot; Mr. Hudson said.    Mr. Hudson also indicated that it is likely to take a year or more for investigators to complete the bulk of their work. And, he added, 'there is a strong possibility that I may very well try some of the resulting cases myself.&quot;    In the meantime, he said, premature release of documents or information could tip off potential targets about the prosecution's strategy. However, Mr. Hudson emphasized, &quot;I think it's too early to tell&quot; whether that actually has happened.    Mr. Hudson's hands-on approach isn't any surprise to those who know him. Helen Fahey, a long-time deputy who replaced Mr. Hudson as Arlington County Commonwealth Attorney, says the words to describe her former boss &quot;clearly are diligence and perseverence.&quot; Even now, associates say, Mr. Hudson still insists on personally supervising some high-profile drug cases and other major prosecutions that aren't linked to the Pentagon scandal.    &quot;He is the toughest, most unrelenting prosecutor that I've ever met,&quot; says George Varoutsos, an old friend and president of the county bar association. He acknowledges, though, that Mr. Hudson sometimes appears overbearing and &quot;doesn't have much of a sense of humor.&quot;    Mr. Hudson is no stranger to controversy. In 1982, he created a furor by secretly tape recording a conversation between a defendant and a court-appointed defense attorney who the prosecutor suspected was unethically demanding an additional fee from his client. John Youngs, a Virginia attorney who has clashed with Mr. Hudson in the past, argues that aggressiveness may be the prosecutor's greatest weakness. As a county prosecutor, he claims, Mr. Hudson had a &quot;blanket policy of prosecuting everything hard.&quot;    Since 1985, when Mr. Meese appointed him chairman of the much-publicized Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, Mr. Hudson's outspoken conservative views on social issues have been the focus of public attention. The 11-member commission generated controversy by concluding that exposure to sexually explicit material &quot;bears a causal relationship&quot; to rape and other sexual crimes against women and children, a link that immediately was challenged by many experts.    Mr. Hudson urged the commission to take a tougher stand, criticized overall police efforts against pornography as inadequate, and encouraged anti-pornography groups nationwide to use the report as a blueprint for boycotts and other community-based efforts. And he used his position to attack sexual promiscuity as &quot;not something that should be socially condoned.&quot;    ---   Karen L. Froslid in Washington contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
