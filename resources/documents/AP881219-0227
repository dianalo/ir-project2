(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Miracle cures and cheaper, healthier food areon the horizons of biotechnology, but for companies able to copewith the regulatory patchwork of the embryonic industry the futureholds huge earnings.   The Industrial Biotechnology Association predicts that sales, nowestimated at $600 million, will rise to between $25 billion and $30billion in the year 2000 and between $75 billion and $100 billion in2025.   Genetically engineered products to cure AIDS and some cancers, tomake pork and beef leaner and healthier, and to protect crops frominsects, weeds and the weather, are just a few of the promises heldout by the industry.   The United States remains the leader in all aspects ofbiotechnology _ diagnostics, medicine, forensics and agriculture,analysts say. But Japan and Western European nations are makinginroads, partly due to a strong government role in financing and, insome cases, looser regulations.   Agencies like the National Institutes of Health and NationalScience Foundation have responded to challenges from abroad inrecent years with more grants to universities and industry, but noteveryone sees that as an answer.   ``They are good to a certain point. They're more directed towardthe research and what we're really about is developing a commercialproduct,'' said Don Reed, chief financial officer of Massachusetts'Cambridge BioScience Corp.   U.S. companies have not yet taken their business to countrieswith looser regulations, such as France or Italy, said Jeff Gibbs,one of three authors of ``Biotechnology and The Environment:International Regulation.'' But it could happen, he said, eventhough the European Community is studying whether to establishuniform, probably stronger, rules.   What companies are doing is taking advantage of the newness ofthe U.S. regulatory environment. The Patent and Trademark Office,facing a backlog of more than 6,000 biotech applications, asked theindustry association in early November to train more patentexaminers to handle the caseload.   Turf battles between federal agencies trying to decidejurisdiction for each new biotechnology product and the constantlychanging science complicate the task of companies seeking a piece ofthe market, said Jan Kurtz, with the science advisory board for thefederal Environmental Protection Agency.   ``We're trying to make a patchwork quilt,'' Ms. Kurtz said.``It's not easy to promulgate new legislation. The questions are allnew.''   Mike Cannell of the Wisconsin Family Farm Defense Fund, Inc., agroup opposed to biotechnology in agriculture for economic andsafety reasons, said, ``It doesn't take a black heart to imagine theworst when the chemical companies are supplying most of theregulatory data.''   The industry says fears of genetically engineered bacteriarunning wild mislead the public and legislators into seeking totoughen the regulatory road.   Big companies have the experience and financial strength to dealwith regulatory delays, but smaller companies feel the pressure.They can no longer ask investors to wait as in the early days ofbiotechnology.</TEXT><HEAD>Venezuelan Doctor Studies Indian Tribe For Cervical Cancer Virus</HEAD><DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A study of women with radicallydifferent sex lives _ prostitutes and totally monogamous Indians _found new evidence linking promiscuity to transmission of a virusthat can cause cervical cancer.   Dr. Jose Azocar compared pap smear samples from the prostituteswith those of Piaroa women, part of a strictly monogamous group thatlives in traditional villages scattered in this South Americannation's Amazon jungle. Cancer is the No. 2 killer in Venezuela;cervical cancer is the most common form in women.   ``It is widely accepted among scientists that HPV causes cervicalcancer, but it is thought that other factors are involved, includingmany births, early onset of sexual activity, and promiscuity. Iwanted to see to what point these other factors were involved,''Azocar said in a recent interview.   Azocar and his colleagues took samples from 125 Piaroa women fromthree villages and found no evidence of HPV or cervical cancer. Theyalso took pap smears from 130 prostitutes; between 25 percent and 40percent, depending on the city, had HPV, and among these there was ahigh incidence of different grades of pre-cancerous tumors.   Sexually speaking, the major difference between the two groupswas the frequency of sex, Azocar said. ``We showed that women whohad many children and who started sex at an early age didn'tnecessarily have HPV. This provides solid data that cervical canceris a sexually transmitted disease.''</TEXT><HEAD>White Has Folks Climbing Trees To Collect Pollen</HEAD><DATELINE>LUTHER, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   All Karl White could get with his degree inbiology was a job climbing trees to collect plants.   But the job happened to be for a company pioneering in allergywork in the middle of hay-fever country, and now other people areclimbing trees for him.   His Crystal Labs supplies 40 percent of the powdered mold, pollenand other allergy villains purchased by labs that make allergy testsand vaccines.   ``Oklahoma is really the center point of all hay fever,'' Whitesaid. Within 500 miles are deserts, trees, hills and mountains, notto mention the Johnson grass and ragweed that flourish in the stateitself.   The location may be perfect and the business lucrative, but Whitesays it also federally regulated, highly seasonal and workers canface some unexpected hazards when they venture into the wildcollecting specimens.   Crystal Labs produces up to 1,100 pounds a year of powder frompollen, mold, animal skin, insects and food. His most expensiveproduct is mites, part of house dust, which sell for about $3,000 anounce when crushed to powder.   Mold can be grown all year in the lab, but plants have to becollected for pollen at just the right time _ just before the pollenis released. The season begins in February with elms and runsthrough October's goldenrod. That's the busiest time for White'sfive employees and 20 contractors.   The work can have complications: Well-meaning citizens oftenassume that people collecting plants are doing something illegal.   ``The most dangerous animal I have run into was humans,'' Whitesaid. ``Almost everytime we go out and start collecting someoneturns me in thinking I'm trying to collect marijuana.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Dec. 22</NOTE></DOC>
