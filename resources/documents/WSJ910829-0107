There had been much talk of Mr. Gorbachev's reappointinghis longtime ally, Eduard Shevardnadze, but Mr. Shevardnadzepublicly stated several times that he didn't want the jobagain. It isn't known whether Mr. Gorbachev offered the jobto Mr. Shevardnadze, though the two were scheduled to meet,according to the independent Soviet news agency Interfax. Mr.Pankin's appointment was announced on the evening news, withno mention of Mr. Shevardnadze.</LP><TEXT>   Alexander Bessmertnykh, Mr. Pankin's predecessor, wasdismissed by Mr. Gorbachev after the coup because he hadn'tspoken out publicly against it.   Mr. Pankin, 60 years old, remained loyal to Mr. Gorbachevby denouncing on the radio what he termed the barbarousmilitary putsch that took Mr. Gorbachev's job away from him,according to Reuters. Mr. Pankin is a poet and formerjournalist who spent eight years as Soviet ambassador toSweden before being sent as envoy to Czechoslovakia. There,he oversaw the withdrawal of Soviet troops and worked on waysto restore trading links that were cut when the Soviet-ledComecon trade association was dissolved.   A Swedish diplomat in Washington remembers Mr. Pankin asan eager supporter of glasnost and perestroika during histime as ambassador in Sweden, from 1982 to 1990. &quot;He becamemore and more outspoken and had a lot of contacts in Swedishsociety,&quot; the diplomat recalls.   Marshall Goldman, associate director of the RussianResearch Center at Harvard University, said, &quot;To have heldhimself out there separately from what was going on (duringthe coup), I would think he would be pro-Western and havedemocratic instincts.&quot; He added, &quot;The guy clearly is a man ofprinciple willing to withstand the overwhelming tide.&quot;   Melor Sturua, a longtime friend, says that Mr. Pankin was&quot;exiled&quot; and made ambassador to Sweden because he was aconstant thorn in the side of former Soviet leader LeonidBrezhnev, and before him, Nikita Khrushchev. As editor inchief of Pravda Youth, &quot;he tried to extend the boundaries ofjournalism under censorship,&quot; said Mr. Sturua, an Izvestiapolitical writer who now is on leave at the HumphreyInstitute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota.   Mr. Pankin also was responsible for implementing thecopyright law in the Soviet Union, Mr. Sturua added. &quot;Hetried to civilize our copyright laws.&quot; Mr. Sturua also saidthat Mr. Pankin speaks English, but not fluently.   As foreign minister, Mr. Pankin now faces the difficulttask of informing the world about who is currently in chargeof the Soviet Union and its foreign policy. As RussianPresident Boris Yeltsin struggles with Mr. Gorbachev forcontrol of the government, and independence-minded republicsmake plans to split off, anxieties world-wide are mountingover such critical matters as the future of the Soviet armedforces and the country's nuclear weapons arsenal.   Foreign bankers are also worried about Sovietdebt-servicing capability after Mr. Yeltsin ordered thatoperations involving foreign exchange and precious metals beconducted only with the approval of his republic. But theRussian Federation later said it had agreed to give theSoviet Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs control over thesematters. The Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs,Vneshekonombank, is responsible for servicing the SovietUnion's foreign debt, which is about $60 billion, and has areputation as a prompt and reliable payer.   While many officials and employees of the Foreign Ministryhad wanted the job to go to Mr. Shevardnadze because of hishighly regarded performance in the past, Mr. Shevardnadzewarded off the pressure, saying he wanted to help build ademocratic reformist political party that would help ensurethe recent victory of democratic forces over conservativeCommunist hard-liners. He resigned last December with thewarning that a &quot;dictatorship&quot; was coming to the Sovietgovernment.   Mr. Gorbachev's purge of those who plotted against him andwho attempted to establish the dictatorship that Mr.Shevardnadze was apparently talking about, continuedyesterday. Mr. Gorbachev dissolved the governing body of theKGB, the Collegium, and ordered the transfer of thousands ofKGB troops that the Collegium controlled to the DefenseMinistry. The Tass news agency reported that 12 people,including former KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov and sixother members of the junta that temporarily placed Mr.Gorbachev under house arrest had been charged with treason,which carries the death penalty. An eighth member of thejunta committed suicide.   Mr. Gorbachev also appointed a commission to investigatethe KGB and its agencies and their role in the failed coup.The parliament also dismissed Mr. Gorbachev's cabinet ofministers, after he said they could no longer be trustedbecause they failed to meet and oppose the coup.   Also yesterday, a delegation from the Russian governmentand the Soviet Parliament arrived in the Ukraine, which hasdeclared its independence, subject to a December referendum.Officials there had become alarmed when Mr. Yeltsin said hereserved the right to contest any borders with any republicthat quit the Soviet Union.   ---   Robert S.
