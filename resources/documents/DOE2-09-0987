The microscopic elements in the turbulent ensembleare taken as laminar diffusion flamelets that are distinguished by theextent of stretching to which they are exposed and, additionally, bythe degree to which their reactants are premixed. Extensive laminar flameletcomputations are performed using a detailed mechanism for the metane-airsystem consisting of more than 250 elementary reactions of 39 chemicalspecies. The degree both of flow field stretching and of partial premixingof reactants is varied systematically. The agreement of the numericalresults with experimental data available from the literature is foundto be excellent. First numerical simulations of turbulent flames on thebasis of the extended flamelet model are performed. The results showthat partial premixing of laminar diffusion flamelets is essential forthe prediction of turbulent flame structures. 29 references.</TEXT></DOC>
