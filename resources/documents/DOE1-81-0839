However, in the many areas of the state where regraded overburdenis suitable for plant growth, presumably less soil needs to be respread.Research directed toward determining respread soil thickness requirementsculminated in 1986 in an effort to change soil salvage and respread regulationsthrough the administrative process established by the Surface MiningControl and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) and the North Dakota StateProgram. Factors which contributed to this successful application ofresearch results to regulatory changes in North Dakota include participationby independent research organizations, long-term financial support forreclamation research, frequent and effective communications among technicalstaffs, and active participation by all parties in the rule-making process.</TEXT></DOC>
