As a result, the tolerance dosein case of radiotherapy of the carcinoma of the urinary bladder was revealedto be as low as TDF 100. The tolerance dose in case of radiotherapy ofthe carcinoma of the uterine cervix treated mainly by conformation radiotherapytechnique or two-axes arc therapy was proved to be TDF 110 - 120, andtreated mainly by intracavitary irradiation 120 or over.</TEXT></DOC>
