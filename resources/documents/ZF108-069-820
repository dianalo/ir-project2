Z-248s, which are 80286-based machines, orpurchase new micros until seeing what type of Desktop II machines would beavailable.andM;&quot;We've been living with what we've got until we saw what was on the contract.andO;We're pretty pleased with what's on it,&quot; said Kenneth S. Becker, the computerhardware manager at an Air Force laboratory at McClellan Air Force Base,Calif.andM;Becker said his lab considered upgrading its Z-248s with 386 processors buthas decided to order new machines via Desktop III for artificial intelligenceapplications, heavy-duty number crunching, file serving and softwaredevelopment.andM;Some non-Air Force microcomputer users, for whom this contract is optional,are taking a more conservative approach.andM;&quot;On the surface, it's too good a deal, so you have to be a skeptic,&quot; said oneveteran computer specialist with a Navy organization that supports severalhundred microcomputer users.andM;&quot;But if it's legit and it's good equipment, then this is a killer deal,&quot; thespecialist added.andM;The Unisys Corp. PW2 820, the standard advanced workstation under thecontract, has a 20-MHz 386 processor with an 82385 cache controller and 32Kof high-speed static RAM cache, 4M RAM expandable to 24M of 32-bit memorywith 8M on the system board, a SCSI interface adapter, a serial mouse, a101-key keyboard and a 3-1/2-inch, 720K/1.44M floppy drive, said Staff Sgt.andO;William Dunlap, a spokesman for the Air Force Standard Systems Center.andM;The standard basis workstation, the Unisys PW2 816, has a 16-MHa 386, nocache RAM and 2M standard RAM expandable to 16M.andP;  Both workstations can beordered with math coprocessors.andM;Although Air Force would not release prices last week, DOD officials whoreceived price lists said the advanced workstation will cost $905.andP;  The basisworkstation will cost $668.andP;  Workstations with math coprocessors will cost$743 and 993.andM;Hard drives, monitors and video adapters must be ordered separately, Dunlapsaid.andP;  Ten hard drives are available, ranging from 42M to 340M.andP;  Alsoavailable are a 616M external write once, read-many drive and an external553M CD-ROM drive.andM;Microsoft Corp.'s MS-DOS Version 4.01 with MS-Windows/386 Version 2.11 willbe the standard MS-DOS operating environment.andP;  The Santa Cruz OperationInc.'s SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 with Xsight/Motif will be thestandard UNIX environment.andP;  Mixed MS-DOS/UNIX environments will run under SCOVP/ix.andM;Based on the price lists obtained by GCN, the advanced workstation with a14-inch, 640- by 480-pixel color VGA monitor and adapter and a 42M internalSCSI hard-disk drive will cost $1,400.andP;  A similarly equipped basicworkstation will cost less than $1,200.andM;Before shipments can start, the Unisys micros still must pass the functionaltest demonstration, set to begin today at Gunter Air Force Base, Ala., andscheduled to run for 10 to 15 days.andM;&quot;I would expect realistically that shipments would be starting in the Marchtime frame,&quot; said James McGuirk, vice president and general manager of UnisysAerospace Operations, the group in charge of the Desktop III contract.andM;&quot;With the protest, we had to stop all discussions [with the Air Force].andO;We're really in the process now of trying to get the administrative functionsstraightened out,&quot; McGuirk said recently in an interview.andM;Under the contract, Unisys must be able to ship at least 3,500 units permonth for the first four months of the contract.andP;  After that initial ramp-upperiod, Unisys must be able to ship at least 6,000 per month.andM;If all options are exercises, the Air Force estimates agencies might buy250,000 micros worth more than $700 million.andP;  The contract is mandatory forthe Air Force and optional for other DOD organizations.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
