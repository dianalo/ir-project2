Numerous evaluations of the performanceof these systems have been reported in the literature. However systematicevaluations of the processing functions of DSA image processors havenot been widely reported. Such an evaluation for one commercial systemis presented in this paper. Functions evaluated include linear transformation,logarithmic transformation, integration, subtraction and temporal filtration.The observations indicate that image processing results are frequentlyachieved by indirect routes which compromise the fidelity of the imagedata.</TEXT></DOC>
