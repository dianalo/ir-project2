Superior, a supplier of replacement parts for piston aircraft engines, is the third sale of a unit by Neoax's precision component business. Proceeds from the three sales totaled $200 million, with pretax gains of $83 million. The company said $77 million of the gains will be included in third-quarter results.    In the 1988 fourth quarter, the Stamford, Conn.-based company had a loss of $11 million on sales of $100 million.    Neoax said proceeds from the sales will be used to reduce debt and preferred-stock obligations. It said the sales will let it concentrate on its core business of providing waste management services to industrial customers.    SP Acquisitions is a new company formed by HMA Investments Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
