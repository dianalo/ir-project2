The figure represents the newspaper's first monthly operating profit since it began in 1982.    Company officials said the paper had a loss of about $900,000 in April and is expected to be &quot;marginally unprofitable&quot; during the summer, when business is normally slower.    But in the final quarter of 1987, &quot;indications point to a meaningful profit,&quot; Gannett said.    Wall Street reacted favorably to the announcement. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Gannett closed at $54.875, up $1.875. When the paper was started in September 1982, Gannett officials had predicted it would be profitable by the end of 1987.    Moreover, Gannett said it now expects USA Today's total loss for 1987 to be considerably smaller than the original projected range of $30 million. Gannett also promised to make public later this year a breakdown of the newspaper's start-up and development costs.    The company said USA Today's paid circulation now is 1,311,792, an increase of about 5.8% from a year earlier.    Analysts have estimated that USA Today's cumulative operating losses have exceeded $300 million since its founding, but Gannett has never confirmed the estimates. </TEXT></DOC>
