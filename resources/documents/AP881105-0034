FBI spokesman William Carter said Friday a criminal investigationwould be launched if a preliminary inquiry determined that federallaw had been violated.   The bureau will review the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, whichdeals with unauthorized access to government computers or computersin two or more states.   If records within the computer systems that were ``infected'' arefound to have been destroyed or harmed, the FBI could conduct afull-scale investigation, Carter said.   The virus is an unauthorized computer program that officials thisweek said reproduced in computers nationwide and apparentlyinstructed them to send copies of itself to other machines through aresearch network, Arpanet.   Although there was no apparent damage, computers were turned offas they became overloaded with material.   The New York Times reported in today's editions that the virusprogram was created by a graduate student at Cornell University,Robert T. Morris Jr., 23, whose father is one of the government'smost respected computer security experts.   Two sources with detailed knowledge of the case told the Timesthat Morris wrote the set of computer instructions as an experiment.The virus was intended to live in the Arpanet undetected, slowlymaking copies that would move from computer to computer, the reportsaid. But a design error caused it instead to replicate madly out ofcontrol, ultimately jamming more than 6,000 computers nationwide.   M. Stuart Lynn, Cornell's vice president for informationtechnologies, said early today the university had not talked toMorris but was investigating his computer files.   ``So far we have determined that his account contains files thatappear to hold passwords for some computers at Cornell and Stanfordto which he is not entitled,'' Lynn said in a statement. ``We alsohave discovered that Morris' account contains a list of passwordssubstantially similar to those found in the virus.'' Passwords arethe codes needed to gain access to computer systems.   The Ithaca, N.Y., school scheduled a news conference for today.   Several telephone calls to the family's home in Silver Spring,Md., near Washington, went unanswered. Later, an answering machinewas attached and messages left on it were not returned.   The younger Morris also could not be reached. The university saidit did not have a local address for him, and Lynn said collegeofficials believed he was on his way to Washington.   Arpanet, established by the Defense Department's AdvancedResearch Projects Agency, is used by researchers and defensecontractors to share data.   Officials said the virus also spread into some governmentcomputers, from NASA's Langley Research Center at Hampton, Va., tothe Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.   At Los Alamos, computer security officer Jimmy McClary said thevirus had caused no damage but a few hundred scientists suffereddelays in their work.   Dr. Raymond S. Colladay, the director of the Advanced ResearchProjects Agency, told a Pentagon briefing the virus had beendefeated in roughly 24 hours' time after being spotted Wednesdayevening.   He said the Pentagon was confident the computer network hadresumed normal operations.   ``It was a benign virus; by that I mean it didn't destroyfiles,'' Colladay said.   Colladay said the computer experts and researchers who use thesystem had concluded the virus program _ while fairly sophisticated_ did not contain any ``Trojan horse'' bug that could crop up againat a later time.   Colladay said he had ordered a new study by his agency of thesecurity procedures used by Arpanet. He said Pentagon officialspurposely had designed the network as an ``open'' system anddeliberately rejected various security procedures in the past oncost grounds.   Colladay and Col. Thomas M. Herrick, the manager of the DefenseData Network, said the Arpanet differed significantly from thecomputer networks that handle classified military information.Herrick said there was never any danger or possibility the viruscould have jumped from the Arpanet to a classified system.   The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act prohibits gaining access to a``federal interest computer without authorization'' and engaging inconduct which ``alters, damages or destroys information.''Conviction carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison.   One of the definitions of a federal interest computer is one oftwo or more computers used in committing an offense which are notall situated in the same state.</TEXT></DOC>
