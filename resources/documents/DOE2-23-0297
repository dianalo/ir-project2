Data from animal studies using radiationsof carefully controlled penetration suggest the depth should be changedbut there is a question about the applicability of these data for humans.NCRP Scientific Committee No. 80 is currently considering the appropriatedepth(s) for measuring skin dose. The basis for their deliberations,the likely consequences of their decision and the authors' recommendationsare discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
