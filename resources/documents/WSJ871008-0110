The talks followed a threat by Canadian Labor Minister Pierre Cadieux that the government would introduce back-to-work legislation if the two sides weren't able to reach a settlement soon.    More than 4,500 postal clerks and mail sorters across Canada were on strike against, or locked out by, the government-owned postal agency yesterday, the eighth day of rotating strikes.    The agency, which is using temporary workers to staff strike-bound postal stations, says mail is moving at normal levels. Employees are represented by the 23,000-member Canadian Union of Postal Workers.    The chief unresolved issue is Canada Post's plan to franchise some of its operations to the private sector. The agency says the move is necessary for it to be self-sufficient by March 1989, as mandated by law. The union opposes the plan, which it says would result in a loss of 4,200 jobs. </TEXT></DOC>
