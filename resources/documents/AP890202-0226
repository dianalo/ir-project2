The Senate voted 95-5 to reject the raise for Congress and othertop federal officials, and to change the law to eliminate currentprocedures which allow a pay increase to take effect without a vote.   Then, the Senate gave voice vote approval to legislation to banmembers from pocketing speaking fees or other honoraria, should thepay raise take effect.   Five senators voted against the package to eliminate thecurrently-proposed pay increase, to roll back the pay raise if thedeadline is missed by the House, and to require votes on all futurepay raises. They were Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.; Edward M. Kennedy,D-Mass.; Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii; Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska; andTed Stevens, R-Alaska.   The final joint resolution was approved by a voice vote.   The vote against the pay increase was lopsided but largelysymbolic, since both chambers must vote to block it. Houseprocedures make it easier to protect a pay raise in that chamber,and Wright, D-Texas, continued as the main target of opponents as hemaneuvered to protect most of the raise.   House members' public positions, like those of the Senate, havebeen overwhelmingly against the 51 percent pay increase, which mustbe disapproved by both chambers before Feb. 8 or it willautomatically take effect.   But Wright said Thursday a ``clear majority'' of members, nowpaid $89,500, privately supported his plan for dodging apre-deadline vote and then voting a partial rollback of the raisealong with a ban on honoraria.   However, the restrictive parliamentary procedure planned by thespeaker requires a tough two-thirds vote before the bill could besent to the Senate. The 51 percent raise above the current $89,500salary would remain in effect unless both chambers agreed to cut itback, and House opponents vowed to roll it back to zero whetherWright wins or loses.   ``It would be very difficult for the speaker to find two-thirdsfor this resolution,'' said Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, even thoughWright's tactic would force pay raise opponents to appear to bevoting to protect the full pay increase.   Wright released partial results of a personal questionnaire,showing 57 percent of House members opposing a pay raise vote beforethe deadline and 54 percent favoring instead a vote to reduce theraise to 30 percent.   The $26,850 pay raise he was proposing was ``a decent raise butnot an exorbitant raise,'' Wright said, compared with the $45,500increase proposed by former President Reagan and endorsed byPresident Bush.   The 30 percent figure was equal to the amount of income Housemembers could lose in a ban on honoraria. The Senate figure is$35,800, as they are currently allowed to retain honoraria equal to40 percent of their salaries.   House members would still make the same amount of money they makenow, he said. ``The difference is we will be serving one master, nottwo, that is, the American people,'' he said.   Actually, most House members would find their incomessubstantially increased, since fewer than half reach the currenthonoraria limit of 30 percent of income, according to theirfinancial disclosures.   Wright said it was his intention that all top federal officials,including federal judges, would receive the same increase. Under hisstrategy, federal judges might still win the full 51 percent payincrease, since under the Constitution those new salaries cannot bereduced once enacted.   Wright has met with House Republican leader Bob Michel ofIllinois to solicit his endorsement of the plan. Wright was joinedat his news conference only by four leading Democratic members, andthe second-ranked Republican in the House supported the concept of adollar-for-dollar trade-off of salary for honoraria.   ``If we do an effective job of prohibiting outside earned income,then an adjustment of that size would be appropriate,'' he said.``Whether we do it before or after the eighth (of February) is lessimportant than what's in the package,'' he said.   As the Senate opened its debate, Majority Leader George Mitchell,D-Maine, said also supported the concept behind the speaker's 30percent proposal, and said it was unfair to Wright to take the bruntof criticism. But he acknowledged the Senate would follow publicopinion and kill the entire raise.   ``If contemporary public opinion were the sole determinant, thepay... would be the same as it was in 1789,'' he said.   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole said, ``I do think there shouldbe a pay raise'' but he said ``there's no way you can explain'' 51percent.   Although a Senate vote to kill the pay raise was long expected,the House leadership's original plan was to weather the storm ofpublic protest and let the pay raise take effect. Then, to lessenthe political damage, they planned action on a bipartisan package ofreforms including an honoraria ban.   Wright this week changed the course when he promised to hold avote to kill the raise before the deadline if a majority of Housemembers wanted it.   A subsequent Associated Press survey on Wednesday showed 88percent of those responding favored such a vote, but Wright said 57percent of those responding to his private tally wanted the deadlineto pass.   Wright's survey ``exposes members to a charge of lying,'' saidRalph Nader, the consumer advocate, citing the Associated Press andsurveys by his own organization.   Numerous public surveys showed members of both chambers wouldvote overwhelmingly against accepting the pay increase.   Wright said the House would vote on rolling back the increase onFeb. 9 as part of an ethics package which would include:   _ An immediate ban on members accepting fees for speaking,writing, consulting, or legal or professional services.   _ Restrictions on travel expenses.   _ A repeal, effective in 1991, of the law allowing seniorlawmakers to pocket excess campaign funds.   Wright's proposal came on the eve of the annual House Democraticretreat at the posh Greenbrier resort in West Virginia, which issubsidized by corporate and union donations.</TEXT></DOC>
