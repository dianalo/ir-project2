The observations were carried out using the Universityof Maryland/Max-Planck-Institut ISEE 3 ULECA (Ultra Low Energy ChargeAnalyzer) sensor, which unambiguously identifies protons and alphas usingthe electrostatic deflection versus residual energy technique. The downstreamparticles exhibit anisotropies due largely, but not entirely, to convectionin the solar wind. Using a detailed technique to find the reference framein which the particle distribution functions are isotropic, we find thatthis frame is moving with respect to the solar wind at speeds from tensto hundreds of kilometers/second, is usually within {similar_to}20% ofthe magnetic field direction, and is directed toward the Sun. We identifythis reference frame as the rest frame of the scattering centers whichisotropize the particle distribution functions. In the solar frame thescattering center frame sometimes moves at the Alfven velocity, but justas often it has significantly higher or lower velocity. The spectralindices of the proton and alpha distribution functions are found to beremarkably constant during the downstream period, being generally insensitiveto changes in particle flux levels, magnetic field direction, and solarwind densities. In two of the three events the proton and alpha spectraare the same throughout the entire downstream period, in agreement withpredictions of diffusive shock acceleration theory. We find that diffusiveacceleration theory cannot predict the particle spectra using only solarwind data. However, using the scattering center velocities, we are ableto correctly predict the particle spectra indices for these three events.copyright American Geophysical Union 1988</TEXT></DOC>
