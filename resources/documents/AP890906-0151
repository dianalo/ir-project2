Pilot Mike McCulley was more blunt: ``I can't imagine how it canhurt anyone unless it hits him on the head, and that's prettyremote. I think it is a complete non-issue except as a philosophicalissue to some people.''   Galileo will be powered by a pair of 122-pound radioisotopethermoelectric generators (RTGs), each containing about 24 pounds ofhighly toxic plutonium-238 dioxide. Instruments called thermocouplesconvert the heat released by the plutonium's decay into electricity.   They are the only known devices that can power a spacecrafttraveling deep into the solar system far from the sun. Similar RTGsprovided power to the Voyager 2 probe that last month relayedstunning photos from Neptune.   The United States has launched 22 nuclear-powered spacecraftsince 1961, with all the plutonium packages encased in superhardenedmaterial designed to survive the worst possible fire or explosion.None resulted in the release of radioactive material, even thoughone package was aboard a rocket that exploded and two survivedflaming re-entries through Earth's atmosphere after accidents.   Some anti-nuclear and environmental groups have protested the useof plutonium aboard Atlantis, citing the 1986 space shuttleChallenger explosion as an example of how things can go wrong. Theycontend a similar explosion could result in radioactivecontamination of the Cape Canaveral area and a subsequent increasein cancer illnesses and death.   Because of the nuclear material aboard, the White House has toapprove the mission, and a decision is expected within a few days.   The opposing groups have said that if approval is given theywould seek a court order to block the launch, now scheduled for Oct.12.   NASA estimates the odds of another shuttle disaster at somewherebetween 1-in-80 and 1-in-800.   The agency said an exhaustive post-Challenger safety reviewindicates the chances of a launch accident in which substantialquantities of plutonium, pulverized to breathable form, could bereleased is about 1-in-2,700. And even then, NASA said, anycontamination would be minor.   The five astronauts who will fly the Galileo mission were askedabout the potential danger at a news conference and in individualinterviews Wednesday.   ``Testing shows that they are built to last and withstand aboutanything you can imagine,'' said mission specialist Ellen Baker.``Everyone I love will be at the launch, and I feel they will beperfectly safe.''   She noted that ``some environmental groups knowledgeable aboutthe RTGs have given their seal of approval on this.''   ``NASA and the Department of Energy have done an excellent jobwith the safeguards,'' said mission specialist Shannon Lucid.   ``If the president doesn't sign off on the RTGs, I would be verydisappointed,'' said Franklin Chang-Diaz, another missionspecialist. ``We would have taken a step backward in space.   ``Without RTGs we wouldn't have had those wonderful images fromNeptune or other planets, and the Galileo mission would not bepossible,'' he said.   Once released from Atlantis, Galileo will embark on a six-yearjourney to Jupiter. Once there it will fire a scientific probe intothe Jovian atmosphere and orbit the planet for 22 months ofextensive exploration.</TEXT></DOC>
