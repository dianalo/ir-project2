The group, in a report prepared for Energy Secretary James D.Watkins, said it found no persuasive evidence that the cold fusionprocess would produce useful sources of energy.   University of Utah scientists last March first announced they hadattained cold fusion, and the claim sparked worldwide efforts toreproduce the phenomenon. Some laboratories have supported the Utahclaims but most have not.   Cold fusion is the claim that the decomposition of water at roomtemperature into hydrogen and oxygen by an electric current passingthrough a palladium electrode leads to the absorption of hydrogenatoms in the electrode. The atoms then fuse to produce helium andlarge amounts of heat.   If such a process could work on a large scale, it would makepossible limitless supplies of cheap energy.   The panel, known as the Energy Research Advisory Board,recommended to Watkins that no special funds be earmarked forinvestigating cold fusion and that the government not establishspecial programs or research centers to work on the issue.   ``Nuclear fusion at room temperature would be contrary to allunderstanding gained of nuclear reactions in the last half century;it would require the existence of an as-yet-undiscovered nuclearprocess,'' the report said.   The panel said it was ``sympathetic toward modest support'' forexperiments with existing funds. This research should focus onconfirming or disproving the claims that excess heat was produced inthe University of Utah experiment.   Separately, the advisory board said in a draft interim report toWatkins that it doubted the potential for using a linear acceleratorinstead of a new nuclear reactor to produce tritium, a radioactivegas needed to make nuclear warheads.   Scientists at Brookhaven and Los Alamos national laboratories andat Westinghouse-Hanford Co. in Washington state concluded in areport earlier this year that a linear accelerator could maketritium more cheaply, quickly and safely than could a new nuclearreactor. Energy Department officials in Washington, however, havesaid the accelerator technology is too uncertain to count on yet.   Watkins in August asked his advisory board to study theaccelerator option.   In a draft of its interim report to Watkins, the panel said thatwhile an accelator would pose fewer safety and environmentalproblems than a new nuclear reactor, those advantages may be morethan offset by the accelerator's need for large amounts ofelectricity to operate.   ``It may be simpler, in fact, to use a nuclear reactor to producetritium directly ... rather than have it, or a fossil plant, produceelectricity to operate the accelerator,'' the report said.   The panel plans to issue a final recommendation to Watkins byFebruary.</TEXT></DOC>
