The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates 2,955 federallyinsured savings and loans, said Friday that December marked theeighth consecutive month of net withdrawals, reversing the tide ofdeposits that poured into Sandamp;Ls following the 1987 stock market crash.   Meanwhile, in other developments:   _Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman, inan interview, confirmed published reports that the Federal ReserveBoard put together a contingency plan last weekend in the event thatthe announcement of President Bush's proposal for the savings andloan crisis triggered depositor runs.   _The FDIC said it has taken control of six more savingsinstitutions, bringing to 10 the number of Sandamp;Ls brought under theagency's jurisdiction since Bush gave it that responsibility onMonday.   The December withdrawals, topping the one-month record of $7.0billion set in November, occurred at a time of mounting publicityabout Sandamp;L problems. Regulators closed or merged 75 institutions thatmonth.   But Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria,Va., attributed the development to interest rate movements ratherthan to nervousness by Sandamp;L customers.   He said customers are turning to money market mutual funds andother investments because Sandamp;Ls are resisting pushing up interestrates as fast. However, he predicted Sandamp;L deposit rates likely wouldbe forced higher as the Federal Reserve Board tightens credit in aneffort to dampen inflation.   ``Boy, that's hard on the bottom line,'' he said. ``This does notbode well for thrift earnings.''   Indeed, one member of the Federal Reserve Board, Martha Seger,dissented from a policy-making board's decision in December to pushinterest rates higher on the grounds that could aggravate Sandamp;Ls'problems.   Her opposition to higher rates was revealed in minutes releasedFriday of the Dec. 13-14 meeting of the Federal Open MarketCommittee.   However, economist Martin Regalia of the National Council ofSavings Institutions said the president's effort this week appearsto have bolstered confidence in savings institutions.   ``If you look at the stock market, they look at this wholeprocess as being a net plus,'' he said. ``Thrift stocks have risenin the last few days because I guess they feel the problem is beingaddressed.''   James Barth, chief economist of the bank board, attributed alarge share of the December deposit flow to a single, healthyinstitution which shrank its deposit base by $3.4 billion as part ofa deliberate strategy of substituting lower cost borrowing. He alsonoted that money normally flows out of savings accounts in Decemberas people spend to celebrate the holidays.   Seidman, in an interview Friday, said administration officialswho he declined to name were predicting depositor runs when Bushannounced his Sandamp;L plan and that the president insisted the FederalReserve have an emergency plan in place.   ``I was on the other side (of the argument) but I was just aseager as anybody to have a plan in place in case I happened to bewrong,'' he said.   The FDIC, which insures bank deposits, will take control of morethan 200 insolvent Sandamp;Ls in the next four to six weeks under acooperation agreement with the agency insuring thrift deposits, theFederal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.   The six institutions taken over Friday by the FDIC are: FirstFederal of Arkansas and Savers Federal Savings and Loan Association,both of Little Rock, Ark.; Sandia Federal Savings and LoanAssociation, Albuquerque, N.M.; Bright Banc, Dallas; UniversitySavings Association, Houston; and Deseret Federal Savings and LoanAssociation, Salt Lake City.</TEXT></DOC>
