The figures, contained in an annual Public Health Service report,show that blacks are dying younger than whites, blacks are twice aslikely to die in infancy as whites and substantially fewer blackwomen who are pregnant receive early prenatal care.   ``The report shows, as have others for as long as they have beenissued, that there is a disparity between the health of our whiteand black populations,'' said Health and Human Services SecretaryLouis Sullivan.   The report is a compilation of statistics previously released bythe National Center for Health Statistics, which is part of thehealth service. It is based on figures for the years 1970 through1986, the latest year for which comprehensive data is available.   While life expectancy at birth for whites increased from 75.3years in 1985 to 75.4 in 1986, life expectancy for blacks declinedfrom 69.5 to 69.4 during the period, the report said. For allAmericans, life expectancy was 74.8 in 1986, up from 74.7 the yearbefore.   For whites and the overall population, the figures were the samein 1984 as in 1985, but for blacks the 1986 decline in lifeexpectency followed a similar one in 1985, when it was 69.7, whichSullivan called ``a disturbing trend.''   The report said the life-span declines among blacks were theresult of increases in deaths from AIDS, homicides, influenza andpneumonia.   ``I think the basic things related to nutrition, poverty, accessto (health) care affect a wide variety of conditions from infantmortality to mortality at later ages and also is probably related tomortality from drug-related violence,'' said Dr. Manning Feinleib,director of the National Center for Health Statistics.   Among the report's other findings:   _Live births to unmarried women more than doubled from 1970 to1986, from 11 percent to 23 percent of all births. In 1986, 11percent of women of Asian and Pacific Islander descent who gavebirth were unmarried, compared with 16 percent of white women, 42percent of American Indian women and 61 percent of black women.   _Between 1970 and 1986, deaths from heart disease declined by 31percent, although it remains the leading cause of death in America.During the same period, death from stroke, the third-leading cause,dropped by 53 percent. Declines in smoking are believed to be thereason for the declines.   _Accidents, including motor vehicle accidents, were thefourth-leading cause of death in the country in 1986 and the mostfrequent cause of death before age 65 among males.   _Although homicide ranks 12th among all causes for death, ittakes nearly as many lives as accidental injuries for black maleswho die before they are 65.   ``These data point us in the direction of expanding our agenda inthe upcoming decade to include a greater focus on such criticalhealth areas as prevention of AIDS, unintentional injuries, homicideand suicide _ many of which demand individual and societalbehavioral change,'' Sullivan said at a news briefing on the report.</TEXT></DOC>
