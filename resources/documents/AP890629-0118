No details were immediately available. Police scheduled a newsconference to discuss the arrest of the person suspected of applyingthe potent herbicide that is making the 50-foot oak's leaves turnbrown and fall off.   Legend has it Stephen F. Austin, the father of Texas, signed atreaty with the Indians under the tree's branches, althoughhistorians give little credence to the story. Over the years, peoplehave proposed marriage under its boughs.   The attack on the venerable oak saddened many, and offeringsranging from get-well cards and flowers to crystals and chicken souphave been left at the ailing tree, which has a 127-foot limb spreadand is 52.5 inches in diameter at chest height.   The vandal could be charged with criminal mischief, punishable byup to 20 years in prison.   The Austin American-Statesman, citing unidentified sources,reported earlier that a man is suspected of poisoning the tree in anattempt to invoke a magic spell.   The circle of herbicide poured next to the tree may be a symbolof unrequited love, the newspaper said.   It was not immediately known if the man cited in the report wasthe one under arrest.   Du Pont Co., which produces the herbicide, Velpar, at a plant inLa Porte, put up a $10,000 reward for the vandal's conviction. TheTexas Forestry Association added $1,000.</TEXT></DOC>
