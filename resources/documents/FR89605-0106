The Staff believes thatthe options self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') should give carefulconsideration to at least three possible measures to further integratethe nation's options markets: an intermarket order routing linkage, a mechanismfor order-by-order routing to the market with the best price, and a centrallimit order file. A. Background The trading of standardized options on securities exchanges began in 1973,with the organization as a national securities exchange of the ChicagoBoard Options Exchange (``CBOE''), and the Commission's approval of theCBOE's options pilot program.\4\<NOTE/> This pilot initially was limited to call options on only16 underlying stocks. Listed options trading expanded rapidly from 1973until July 1977, when the options exchanges, at the Commission's behest,agreed to a moratorium on any further listings. In addition to the CBOE'sprogram, the Commission approved options pilot programs at four other exchanges:the American (``Amex''),\5\<NOTE/> Philadelphia (``Phlx''),\6\<NOTE/>    Pacific (``PSE''),\7\<NOTE/> and Midwest (``MSE'') \8\<NOTE/> Stock Exchanges. Applications by the New York Stock Exchange(``NYSE'') and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'')to trade options also were pending. By mid-1977, the number of call optionsclasses traded on exchanges had grown from 16 to 219, and put options tradingalso had been approved.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 9985 (February 1,1973), 1 S.E.C.

The MSE's options program was merged into the CBOE'sin 1979.  The development of options trading programs by the exchanges that followedthe CBOE raised the question of whether, and under what conditions, multipletrading \9\<NOTE/> should occur. In February 1976, the CBOE initiated tradingof an option class that already was being traded on the Phlx, and in Marchof that year, the Commission approved the PSE options program, which includedlistings of options classes already traded on other exchanges. Other exchangesquickly followed and also began to engage in multiple trading. BetweenFebruary    1976 and July 1977, 22 classes of call options were tradedon more than one exchange.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The NYSE did not begin to trade options on listed stocksuntil 1985. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21759 (February 14, 1985),50 FR 7250. The Commission has approved in principle a proposal by theNASD to trade standardized options. Indeed, the NASD commenced on September13, 1985, and subsequently terminated on July 18, 1986, a program to tradestandardized options on certain over-the-counter (``OTC'') stock indexes.<T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 22404 (September 13, 1985)50 FR at 38235. Nevertheless, the part of the NASD's proposal that wouldhave integrated the trading of options with their underlying stock wasdeferred pending further developments in the OTC market. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22026 (May 8, 1985), 50FR 20310. In July 1977, in response to concerns over the rapid growth in listed optionstrading and possible trading and sales practice abuses, the Commissionrequested that the options exchanges refrain from listing any options classesbeyond those already listed as of July 15, 1977. In October 1977, the Commissionannounced that it would undertake a comprehensive investigation and studyof the standardized options markets (``Options Study'').\10\<NOTE/> In announcing this Study, the Commission expressed concernover, among other things: (1) The adequacy of the SROs' surveillance systems;(2) the adequacy of Commission and SRO rules to prevent fraudulent, deceptiveand manipulative practices in connection with options trading; (3) thedevelopment of the standardized options markets in a manner consistentwith the public interest and the perfection of the mechanisms of a nationalmarket system; and (4) the development of appropriate standards for evaluatingparticular programs which would have the effect of expanding or alteringexisting pilot options trading programs.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 14056 (October 17,1977), 42 FR 56706.<ITAG tagnum="94"><ITAG tagnum="69"><ITAG tagnum="50">SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="18">[Release No. 26871; File No. S7-15-89]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Options Market Structure </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>AGENCY:</T2> Securities and Exchange Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ACTION:</T2> Request for comment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUMMARY:</T2> The Securities and Exchange Commission is releasing aconcept release, prepared by the staff of the Commission's Division ofMarket Regulation, which discusses the market structure issues associatedwith options multiple trading and outlines several possible market structureenhancements.

The Options Study was completed and a report was released on December 22,1978.\11\<NOTE/> The Options Study Report examined some of the major issuesof market structure in the standardized options markets, including multipletrading,\12\<NOTE/> and steps the Commission should consider to assure evolutionof the standardized options markets in a manner consistent with establishmentof a national market system.\13\<NOTE/> By examining certain indicia of market quality, such as continuity\14\<NOTE/> and liquidity,\15\<NOTE/> the Options Study found that multiple trading may improvethe quality of markets for multiply traded options classes, at least inthe short run.\16\<NOTE/> In addition to market quality factors, the Report describedhow multiple trading could promote competition among market centers, leadingto greater operational efficiencies, improved services and new technologicaldevelopments. The Report also noted that the statutory goal of competition``among brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and between exchangemarkets and markets other than exchange markets'' \17\<NOTE/> hardly could be pursued if multiple trading were not permitted. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Report of the Special Study of the Options Markets tothe Securities and Exchange Commission, 96th Cong., 1st Sess.

As discussed in greater detail below, the Options Study recognized thatmultiple trading could result in some degree of market fragmentation, inthat pricing in the various markets might not always accurately reflectthe aggregate buying and selling interest for a particular security. TheStudy also recognized that, even in a multiple trading environment, concernsover fair competition among markets might remain. In March 1980, after implementing a number of the Options Study recommendations,the Commission ended the voluntary moratorium on expansion of the standardizedoptions markets.\18\<NOTE/> Although the Commission, in ending the moratorium, resolvedto permit the expansion by the options exchanges of put and call optiontrading, it deferred a decision to expand multiple trading. After notingthe potential benefits, on the one hand, and the fragmentation and faircompetition concerns, on the other hand, the Commission concluded that``under appropriate circumstances, the benefits of expansion of multipletrading appear to outweigh any adverse consequences.'' \19\<NOTE/> The Commission decided, however, to defer the general expansionof multiple trading ``in order to afford the [SROs] an opportunity to considerwhether, and to what extent, the development of market integration facilitieswould minimize concerns regarding market fragmentation and maximize competitiveopportunities in the options markets.'' \20\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16701 (March 26,1980), 45 FR 21426 (``Moratorium Termination Release''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 21431.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ <T3>Id. </T3>The options markets were asked to consider jointly whether market integrationfacilities should be built, and if so, how these facilities should be designed.To provide some guidance, the Commission outlined three possible (complementaryor alternative) approaches: (1) A market linkage system similar  to theIntermarket Trading System (``ITS''); \21\<NOTE/> (2) a requirement that brokerage firms handling retail ordersindividually route each order to the market center showing the best quotationaccompanied by a quotation size (<T3>i.e., </T3>number of contracts) equalling or exceeding that of theorder; and (3) an order exposure system for options public limit orders.The Commission suggested that the third approach, a limit order exposuresystem, might be the most fruitful course for the options exchanges topursue, and that the prospects for the other two integration measures mightbe limited insofar as a firm quote rule could not be applied, at that time,to options trading.\22\<NOTE/> A market linkage system or individualized routing of retailorders would depend, to a large extent, on the quality and reliability(<T3>i.e., </T3>firmness) of quotation information.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ The ITS is an inter-market order and message routingfacility among the nation's securities markets. <T3>See </T3>discussion <T3>infra </T3>at notes 59-63 and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ The options exchanges had argued that a firm quote rulewould not work in the options environment. Due to the derivative natureof options and the need to update multiple series whenever there is a changein the price of the underlying stock, it was thought that quotes couldnot be updated quickly enough to accommodate a firm quote rule. Further,the CBOE maintained that such a rule would be difficult to administer inthe competing market maker trading systems used by the CBOE, MSE and PSE.Letter from Joseph W. Sullivan, President, CBOE, to George A. Fitzsimmons,Secretary, SEC, dated August 1, 1977. The options exchanges formed an inter-exchange task force to respond tothe Commission's request in the Moratorium Termination Release that theystudy the feasibility of market integration measures. The task force issuedtwo reports, in January and September of 1981,\23\<NOTE/> in which it concluded that a limit order exposure systemwas not likely to reduce substantially the adverse effects of multipletrading. The task force did not explore any other possibilities for addressingmarket structure concerns in a multiple trading environment.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ Interim Report of the American, Pacific, and PhiladelphiaStock Exchanges and the Chicago Board Options Exchange in response to ReleaseNo. 34-16701, dated January 8, 1981; and Supplementary Report of the American,Pacific and Philadelphia Stock Exchanges and the Chicago Board OptionsExchange in response to Release No. 34-16701, dated September 1, 1981.The CBOE also submitted separate presentations on some of the market structureissues raised in the Moratorium Termination Release. <T3>See </T3>Letters from Walter E. Auch, Chairman and Chief ExecutiveOfficer, CBOE, to George A. Fitzsimmons, Secretary, SEC, dated September22, 1980, and January 8, 1981. In the meantime, in view of the Commission's deferral of an expansion ofmultiple trading, and the limited number of attractive new options availablefor listing, the Commission asked the options exchanges to develop a fairmethod for allocating among themselves new options. In response, the exchangesproposed and the Commission approved the lottery system for allocatingnew options (``the Allocation Plan'').\24\<NOTE/> This system has remained in place with little modificationsince its adoption in 1980. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16863 (May 30, 1980),45 FR 37928.The Commission has, however, declined to restrict multiple trading in otherproducts. For example, in approving the CBOE's proposal to trade optionson Government National Mortgage Association securities, in February 1981,the Commission stated that it did not believe that its decision to defermultiple trading in equity options should apply to non-equity options.\25\<NOTE/> This was followed, on December 2, 1981, by a policy statementin which the Commission announced its view that ``competitive forces shouldbe permitted to define the structure of the non-equity options marketsto the maximum extent possible,'' and that it would not designate any singleexchange as the exclusive market place for non-equity options.\26\<NOTE/> In adopting this policy, the Commission rejected the argumentsof many industry commentators, who maintained that the same concerns raisedin the equity options context_market fragmentation and unfair competitionbetween markets_would apply in the non-equity options context. The Commissionfound that these concerns were outweighed by the benefits of multiple tradingand by the difficulties that would be involved in allocating non-equityinstruments. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 17577 (February 26,1981), 46 FR 15242. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 18297 (December 2,1981), 46 FR 60376. In 1985, the Commission approved proposals by the options exchanges totrade options on certain OTC equity securities.\27\<NOTE/> In doing so, the Commission again considered the multipletrading question and concluded that the benefits of allowing multiple tradingwould outweigh any adverse effects. Among other things, the Commissionfound that, even if actual competition among exchanges for a given optionis short-lived and a primary market for the option emerges, it is betterthat this should occur as the result of market forces than through thelottery allocation system. The Commission again urged options market participantsto consider the development of market integration facilities, and voicedthe belief that the approval of multiple trading for options on OTC stocksmight provide the necessary impetus for the options exchanges to developsuch facilities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22026 (May 8, 1985),50 FR 20310. In November 1986, the Commission released two staff studies on the effectsof options multiple trading.\2\\8\<NOTE/> These studies found that multiple trading led to improvedquality of markets, as measured by bid-ask spreads, and that these benefitsoutweighed the detrimental effects of any pricing disparities between markets.These studies concluded that multiple trading would produce substantialsavings to investors.\29\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ Directorate of Economic and Policy Analysis, ``The Effectsof Multiple Trading on the Market for OTC Options'' (November 1986), andOffice of the Chief Economist, ``Potential Competition and Actual Competitionin the Options Market'' (November 1986). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ The CBOE, Phlx and PSE challenged the findings of thestudies. <T3>See </T3>Rule 19c-5 Adoption Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 1, at notes 25-26 and accompanying text. B. MultipleTrading and Options Market Structure Sections 6(b)(8), 11A, and 23(a)(2) of the Act express Congress' intentthat the securities markets be free from competitive restraints to thefurthest extent possible consistent with the other goals of the Act. Ithas long been the Commission's policy to foster competition among the nation'ssecurities markets and encourage multiple trading of securities. In particular,the Commission has supported the trading of NYSE-listed securities on regionalexchanges, and has acted to remove barriers to regional exchanges competingwith the Am.w and NYSE. Against this background, the Commission's deferral,since 1980, of an expansion of multiple trading in equity options, andthe continued dearth of potential competition in equity options trading,are an anomaly. In view of the development of the options markets since1980 and the recognition that multiple trading is likely to bring benefitsto investors, the Commission determined that restrictions on options multipletrading impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate infurtherance of the purposes of the Act. Accordingly, in 1989, the Commissionadopted Rule 19c-5 which amends the rules of national securities exchangesgoverning the listing and trading of standardized options to prohibit (aftera specified phase-in period) any exchange from limiting by any means itsability to list any stock option class because that option class is listedon another exchange.\30\<NOTE/> The Commission also designed the Rule to provide a substantialphase-in period to reduce market structure and operational concerns. Specifically,commencing January 22, 1990, no options exchange may limit its abilityto list up to ten standardized stock option classes overlying exchange-listedstocks that were also listed on another options exchange on or before January22, 1990. Further, as of January 22, 1990, no options exchange can limitits ability to list any standardized options class first listed on anotheroptions exchange on or after January 22, 1990, because that options classis listed on another options exchange. Finally, as of January 21, 1991,no options exchange may limit by any means its ability to list any stockoptions class because that class is listed on another exchange. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ <T3>See </T3>Rule 19c-5 Adoption Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 1. Any consideration of market structure issues associated with options multipletrading must be guided by Congress' findings regarding the essential ``goalsand objectives of a national market system for qualified securities'' expressedin Section 11A of the Act.\31\<NOTE/> Section 11A encourages ``fair competition among brokers anddealers, among exchange markets, and between exchange markets and marketsother than exchange markets'' and ``the availability to brokers, dealers,and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactionsin securities.'' In section 11A, Congress also made the finding that ``[t]helinking of all markets * * * through communication and data processingfacilities will foster efficiency, enhance competition, increase the informationavailable to brokers, dealers and investors, facilitate the offsettingof investors' orders, and contribute to best execution of such orders.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ <T3>See </T3>Senate Report, <T3>supra </T3>note ?3, at 7.As the Commission observed in an early statement on the development ofa national market system: ``[t]he major problems to which the idea of anational market system is addressed are those arising from `market fragmentation,'or the existence of multiple, geographically separated forums in whichtrading in the same security occurs * * *.'' \32\<NOTE/> This dispersion of trading activity in fragmented marketscould, under certain circumstances, result in pricing disparities betweenmarkets, that is, prices which do not reflect a complete assessment ofthe aggregate buying and selling interest for a particular security.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 14416 (January 26,1978), 43 FR 4354, 4356.In addition to the inefficiencies inherent in such disparate pricing, multipletrading also may raise so-called ``best execution'' concerns. Regardlessof whether there are significant pricing disparities or merely marginalprice differences between markets, orders may not be routed to the marketplacewhere they would be executed at the best available price. This so-called``best execution'' concern is of particular significance for retail orders.A brokerage firm typically does not make retail order routing decisionson an order-by-order basis; instead it designates one market as ``primary''\33\<NOTE/> and automatically routes all retail orders to that marketunless and until it designates another market as primary. Institutionaland other large or complex orders, on the other hand, are normally providedindividualized attention by the firm's options trading desk, or ``specialhandling.'' <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ The Options Study Report observed that ``[a]lthough thebases that * * * large retail firms use for designating an exchange as``primary'' vary from firm to firm, a principal factor that the firms consideris the volume of public orders that are [sic] executed on each exchange.''Options Study Report, <T3>supra </T3>note 11, at 831. As explained below in the discussion of``fair competition'' among marketplaces, there are now indications thatbrokerage firms rely increasingly on market quality considerations in determiningwhere to route retail orders. <T3>See infra</T3> notes 40-41 and accompanying text.Multiple trading need not, however, lead to significant pricing and bestexecution problems. The Options Study Report concluded that:<ITAG tagnum="20">dispersion of order flow among market centers need not result in pricinginefficiencies [because] public dissemination of quotation and transactioninformation may to a large extent assure that professional and nonprofessionalmarket participants are apprised, on a current and continuous basis, ofthose markets offering the most favorable execution opportunities (at leastfor orders of modest size) so that they have the opportunity to direct* * * orders appropriately * * *. In addition, competition among marketmakers on the floors of exchanges   multiply trading an option class and,in many circumstances, the trading activities of professional traders andarbitrageurs may discipline option pricing among market centers to a substantialdegree.\34\</ITAG><NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ Options Study Report, <T3>supra </T3>note 11, at 842-43.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Moreover, in adopting Rule 19c-5, after reviewing the recent experiencewith multiple trading, the Commission found that the market fragmentationproblems from OTC options have been minimal, and little evidence existsthat full-scale multiple trading would significantly increase these problems.\35\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ <T3>See </T3>Rule 19c-5 Adoption Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 1, at note 117 and accompanying text.Market openings present a special situation regarding inter-market pricingdisparities and best execution concerns. While public dissemination ofquotation and transaction information (and, perhaps, an inter-market linkage)may serve to limit adverse fragmentation effects from arising during thetrading day, it is more difficult to disseminate and absorb quotation informationfrom another market when both exchanges are trying to open the same optionclass simultaneously. This is particularly the case because the openingprice of each option series will be dependent on the price at which theunderlying stock opens. Pricing disparities are most likely to occur wheretwo or more markets open trading in the same security more or less simultaneouslywithout the benefit of price and order imbalance information from all marketstrading the security. For example, the Options Study Report described  one particularly dramatic instance in 1978, where the same Bally optionopened at $5 on one exchange and at $10 on another exchange twenty minuteslater, without there having been an appreciable change in the price ofthe underlying stock in that interval.\36\<NOTE/> More recent experience with multiple trading, however, hasnot produced significant pricing problems. In adopting Rule 19c-5, theCommission noted that the exchanges have been able to mitigate pricingproblems at the opening, even if this has meant allowing the primary marketto open and establish a price first.\37\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ Options Study Report, <T3>supra </T3>note 11, at 840. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ <T3>See </T3>Rule 19c-5 Adoption Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 1, at note 112 and accompanying text.In addition to market fragmentation, concern also has been expressed thatmultiple trading may not fully facilitate ``fair competition'' among marketplaces.Specifically, commentators have argued that even with multiple trading``fair competition'' may be impeded by brokerage order routing practices.\38\<NOTE/> As indicated above, brokerage firms tend not to route retailorders on an order-by-order basis to the market displaying the best quotation.Instead, for each option the firms will designate one market as ``primary''and direct all retail order flow to that market. In the past, the Commissionhas been concerned that primary market designation decisions have beenguided almost exclusively by the volume of trading in a security alreadyoccurring on a particular exchange.\39\<NOTE/> Accordingly, the designation decisions of a few large brokeragefirms could cause the bulk of all retail order flow in an option to berouted to a single exchange. In the Moratorium Termination Release, theCommission expressed its concern that, because of this so-called primarymarket phenomenon, meaningful competition for order flow in any given optionmay be no more than a transitory phenomenon. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Statement of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.in Response to Release No. 34-24613, dated February 1, 1988 (``CBOE response'')at 11. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ Firms have responded to criticism of these mechanicalrouting practices by arguing that, in routing orders to the market withthe most business, they are more likely to receive an execution at a pricebetween the bid and offer and less likely to ``miss the market.''It appears, however, that brokerage firms now consider a broader rangeof factors than merely volume in making market designation decisions. Forexample, one major firm, Merrill Lynch, described in its comments in theRule 19c-5 proceedings the process by which it designates a primary marketfor multiple traded options.\40\<NOTE/> Designation decisions are made by a standing committee composedof individuals from various areas of the firm experienced in options-relatedfunctions. Among the factors considered by this committee, according tothe firm's comments, are ``the quality of the markets made by the assignedspecialist or market makers, the depth and liquidity of the market, andthe operational facilities and responsiveness of the exchanges to complaintsand suggestions for improving their facilities.'' Recent experience withmultiple trading of OTC options suggests that firms also may be more willingto review periodically their order routing decisions.\41\<NOTE/> Furthermore, as the release adopting Rule 19c-5 explains,recent experience with multiple traded options on OTC stocks suggests thatthe competition between and among exchanges for order flow may not be asshort-lived as once thought. Nor has one exchange emerged as the only winnerin competition for order flow in multiple traded OTC options.\42\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ Letter from Daniel P.

The experiencewith multiple trading of options on OTC stocks since 1985 has shown, however,that, even in the absence of market integration  facilities, some of theseconcerns may have been exaggerated. Particularly with respect to marketfragmentation concerns, the experience with multiple trading of OTC issueshas failed to produce anything like the dramatic pricing disparities discussedin the Options Study Report.\43\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ <T3>Id. </T3>at note 112 and accompanying text. Nevertheless, the Staff believes that an exploration of market integrationfacilities which might further reduce pricing inefficiencies, enhance bestexecution opportunities and increase competitive alternatives is valuable.The Staff emphasizes, however, that the purpose of this discussion is notto dictate, at this time, changes in the trading environment for optionsbut to facilitate analysis by the options markets and the securities industry.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Quotation Information in the Options Markets </ITAG>The availability and reliability of comprehensive quotation informationfor options is an important element in considering the concerns traditionallyassociated with multiple trading. Current and reliable quotation informationenhances the ability of market participants to direct orders to marketsoffering the most favorable execution. The dissemination of such quotationinformation also furthers the ability of markets to compete for order flowand to facilitate the activities of market professionals who ensure thatpricing among markets remains in line.  To understand the existing quote and trade reporting regime for options,and to consider whether modifications would enhance a multiple tradingenvironment, it may be helpful to outline the rules governing the collectionand dissemination of quotations for stocks. Pursuant to section 11A(a)(1) \44\<NOTE/> and other provisions of the Act, the Commission has adoptedrules governing the collection, display, and reliability of stock quotes.Pursuant to the Quote Rule (Rule 11Acl-1 under the Act) \45\<NOTE/> all exchanges are required, at all times that they are openfor trading, to make available to securities information vendors the highestbid and lowest offer for certain equity securities that they trade. Subjectto certain exceptions, the rule also requires exchange members to honortheir quotes, <T3>i.e.</T3>, the rule requires ``firm'' quotes. In addition, to ensurethat all markets have an equal opportunity to advertise their prices, theVendor Display Rule (Rule 11Acl-2 under the Act) \46\<NOTE/> provides that, in displaying quotations, securities informationvendors must include either: (1) The best bid and best offer from amongall markets (with identifiers indicating the reporting market center(s)making available these best bids and offers), or (2) a montage showingquotations from all reporting markets. Many securities information vendorsdo, in fact, elect the second display mode and show a montage of quotationsfrom all reporting markets. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ 15 U.S.C. 78k-1(a)(1) (1982) . <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ 17 CFR 240.11Acl-1 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ l7 CFR 240.11Acl-2 (1988). By their terms, neither the Quote Rule nor the Vendor Display Rule applyto quotations for options. Nonetheless, a system for the collection anddissemination of quotation and transaction information for options hasdeveloped that is in many ways similar to that for stocks. All of the optionsexchanges are participants in a national market system plan for the collectionand dissemination of quotation and last sale information. The plan is administeredby the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA''). Each exchange collects\47\<NOTE/> and transmits to the OPRA system ``bids and offers at statedprices or limits with respect to [options] in which it provides a market,sufficient in number and timeliness to reflect the current state of themarket in such [options].'' \48\<NOTE/> OPRA in turn makes this quotation information available tosecurities information vendors, which disseminate it to their subscribers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ The mechanics of this process differ according to whetherthe exchange uses a unitary specialist system or a competing market makersystem. At the Amex, NYSE and Phlx, the specialist is responsible for quotations.At the CBOE and PSE, which use competing market maker systems, an exchangeemployee is responsible for monitoring and publishing quotations as theyare made from among competing market makers, floor brokers, and the OrderBook Official (an exchange official who holds the book of agency limitorders). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ <T3>See</T3> Plan for Reporting of Consolidated Options Reports and QuotationInformation, section V(b) (available on file at the Commission's home officein Washington, DC). A significant issue in considering whether the existing quote and tradereporting regime for options needs to be adapted for multiple trading isthe extent to which equity options quotes are firm, or otherwise reliable.In the past, many commentators have argued that firm quotes are not possiblein the options environment, and that this lack of firm quotes precludesbuilding market linkage systems. Because of the derivative nature of options,and the need to adjust quotes in numerous series in response to a singleprice change in the underlying security, it was thought to be impracticalor even impossible to require options market professionals always to honortheir quotes. A firm quote requirement also was thought to pose specialproblems for the exchanges using multiple market maker systems; for example,it was argued that there would be difficulties in identifying the memberof a trading crowd responsible for a quote, and in providing a mechanismfor quotes to be modified or withdrawn. There have been two developments in recent years which suggest that thearguments that firm options quotes are not possible should be reexamined.First, the development and use by the options exchanges of sophisticatedautomated systems, known as ``Autoquote'' systems, has made it possiblefor market professionals to update their quotes in numerous options seriessimultaneously.\49\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ We recognize that while use of Autoquote systems mayassist in market-making activity, it also may contribute to strains onthe capacity of market data systems by generating more quotations, in morecondensed periods of time, than would be possible if quotes were enteredonly manually. Second, and more importantly, most options markets have developed systemsor trading policies to provide what are, in effect, firm quotes for publiccustomer orders of up to ten contracts in certain options. The CBOE andAmex have developed automated execution systems (known as Retail AutomaticExecution System or ``RAES'' and the automatic execution system or ``AUTO-EX'',respectively) which provide executions of such orders at the best bid oroffer available on each exchange at the time of order entry.\50\<NOTE/> Market makers on the CBOE, and specialists and RegisteredOptions Traders on the Amex who participate in these systems are requiredto accept executions, on a rotation basis, by the systems at the applicableinside quote. Although these systems do not currently include all equityoptions listed on the two exchanges, the Commission recently approved proposalsby the exchanges that would allow all such options eventually to be included.\51\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ The Phlx also has filed a proposed rule change, SR-Phlx89-03,with the Commission to adapt its automated order routing and confirmationsystem, known as ``AUTOM,'' to include an automated execution functionfor certain eligible market and marketable limit orders. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 25995 (August 15, 1988),53 FR 31781 (relating to CBOE's RAES); Securities Exchange Act Rel. No.25996 (August 15, 1988), 53 FR 31779 (relating to Amex's AUTO-EX system).The availability of what are, in effect, firm quotes for certain ordersis not limited to the CBOE and Amex. The Phlx and PSE, which currentlydo not use automated execution systems, have adopted trading policies toensure that for certain series of options (generally, the most active ones)public customer orders are filled at the best bid or offer prevailing onthe exchange. In particular, the trading policies, termed ten-up requirements,require that when specialists/market-makers are responsible for the bestbid and/or offer in certain specified option classes, customer orders areto be filled to a minimum depth of ten contracts by the specialist/market-makersin the trading crowd.\5\\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ <T3>See</T3> PSE Rule VI, Sections 48 and 79, and PSE Options Floor ProcedureAdvice B-12; Phlx Rule 1033(A). The PHLX recently expanded its ten-up requirementto all options series traded on the PHLX and to instances where floor tradersare not quoting the best bid or offer. Securities Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 26669 (March 27, 1989), 54 FR 13282. In addition, the CBOE has fileda proposed rule change with the Commission to create a pilot program torequire firm quotes for up to ten contracts for public customer orders.Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 26570 (February 24, 1989), 54 FR 8857.These developments show that firm quotes in options are, at least to alimited extent, possible. In particular, the development by the optionsexchanges of systems and trading policies which provide firm quotes forpublic customers demonstrates the fallacy of the argument that firm quotesare inherently incompatible with options trading. While firm quotes maybe possible in retail options trading, however, the involvement of professionaltraders presents special problems.  If required to honor their quotes forprofessional traders, options market makers and specialists are vulnerableto being ``picked off'' by professional traders whenever they have notadjusted their quotes quickly enough.\53\<NOTE/> This could impose substantial costs and risks on market makers,which could cause market makers to reduce the number of securities in whichthey make a market. If this were to occur it might effect options marketliquidity.\54\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ In other words, although market makers may be willingto honor disseminated quotes for public customers' orders, which reflectthe relatively random flux of buy and sell orders, they may be less willingto make those quotes available to other professional traders where thereis a greater likelihood that such traders may be acting on informationgenerally not known to public customers. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\4\ <T3>See also</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26361 (December 15,1988), 53 FR 51605 (order approving NASD proposed rule change limitingaccess to the Small Order Execution System for professional traders). The Staff does not believe that it is now necessary or appropriate to extendthe firmness requirement of the Quote Rule to options. It is importantto recognize that the options markets generally provide accurate quotes,even where the quotes are not expressly firm. Moreover, firm quotes forsmall customer orders are now generally available. It appears that optionsquotes are sufficiently reliable to support an intermarket linkage or anorder routing switch. Furthermore, the Staff believes that the OPRA infrastructure and the standardsand procedures for collecting and disseminating market information arefundamentally adequate  to support multiple trading. Clearly, the adoptionof multiple trading may require a review of existing procedures and enhancementsof data storage and processing capacity.\55\<NOTE/> The Staff is confident, however, that the options exchangesand OPRA will be able to address these tasks. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ <T3>See infra</T3> note 58. In adopting the Vendor Display Rule for stocks (described above), the Commissionrecognized that the manner in which securities information vendors displaymarket information can have implications for competition among markets.In requiring that vendors display either the best bid and offer from amongall markets or a montage showing quotations from all markets, the Commissionsought to ensure that all markets would be able to engage in price competitionon an equal basis. The Staff has considered whether it may be necessaryto adopt vendor display requirements for options in a multiple tradingenvironment, and, to this end, has conducted a review of the current practicesof a group of vendors \56\<NOTE/> regarding multiply traded options on OTC stocks. The Stafffound that many of these vendors provide a montage showing the quotes ofcompeting exchanges for each series of these OTC options, although in somecases the montage is not part of the vendor's basic service. All carry,in one form or another, quotation information from all markets tradinga particular options  class. In other words, for multiply-traded optionson OTC stocks, vendors currently carry the data that is necessary to makeorder routing choices among markets. We note, however, that none of thevendors contacted provides this data in the form of the best bid and offerfrom among all markets. We anticipate that as multiple trading evolves,pursuant to the terms of Rule 19c-5, vendors might wish to offer quotationinformation for the more active multiply traded series in the abbreviatedform of a best bid and offer. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\6\ The Staff surveyed Automated Data Processing, BridgeInformation Systems, Quotron, Track Data, and Wang Financial InformationService Corp. The Staff preliminarily has concluded that it is not necessary to imposevendor display requirements for options. The staff does believe, however,that vendor practices should be consistent with the notion of fair competition.Accordingly, we will continue to monitor vendor practices closely as multipletrading is phased in pursuant to the terms of Rule 19c-5.\57\<NOTE/> In particular, the Commission would be concerned by, andwould not permit, vendor practices that do not provide competing exchangesan adequate opportunity to disseminate their quotes, as would be the case,for example,  were a vendor discriminatorily to eliminate information fromcompeting markets.\58\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\57\ The Commission has explicit authority under the Act toprescribe rules and regulations to ``assure the prompt, accurate, reliable,and fair collection, processing, distribution, and publication of informationwith respect to quotations for and transactions in . . . securities andthe fairness and usefulness of the form and content of such information.''Section 11A(c)(1)(B) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 78k-1(c)(1)(B)(1982)]. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\58\ The Staff recognizes that vendors may be constrainedby data capacity management considerations. A number of commentators inthe Rule 19c-5 proceeding, including the Information Industry Association(``IIA'') and Automated Data Processing, expressed concern that multipletrading could lead to a proliferation of options market data and placeincreasing strains on the operational capabilities of vendors. The IIAsuggested several specific measures to address vendor capacity concernsin a multiple trading environment. It recommended that: (1) Proceduresbe considered to permit quotation reporting to begin before the marketopening, to reduce the information reporting ``peak'' that typically occursat the opening; (2) quotation reporting for inactive option series be deferredfrom the opening until less active periods of the day; (3) use of Autoquotebe discouraged. Letter from Kenneth B. Allen, Senior Vice President, IIAto Jonathan Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated February 12, 1988. The Staff believesthat the options exchanges should consider the capacity enhancements recommendedby IIA. It is to address concerns over market data capacity, in part, thatthe Commission has determined to ``phase-in'' multiple trading accordingto the terms of Rule 19c-5. The Staff plans to work with the IIA, OPRAand options SROs during the phase-in period to address these issues. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Market Integration Facilities </ITAG>The discussion of means to alleviate the market fragmentation concernstraditionally associated with options multiple trading has focused on threemeasures: (1) An intermarket linkage to allow orders to be sent among markets;(2) a mechanism to route small customer orders to the ``best'' market andto guarantee an execution at the best bid or offer of the competing markets;and (3) a central limit order file. The Staff believes that each of thesemeasures has merit and should be given serious consideration by the optionsexchanges. A. Intermarket Order Routing LinkageThere is currently one major intermarket linkage system in operation. Thissystem, known as the ``Intermarket Trading System'' (``ITS''), was developedjointly by several of the stock exchanges, and authorized by the Commissionas a national market system facility, pursuant to section 11A(a)(3)(B)of the Act.\59\<NOTE/> The ITS is a computer-communications linkage among the majorstock exchanges and certain NASD market makers that provides facilitiesand procedures for: (1) The display of composite quotation informationat each of the participant markets so that brokers are able to determinereadily the best bid and offer available from any participant for a multiply-tradedsecurity; (2) efficient routing of orders and administrative messages betweenmarket participants; and (3) participation, under certain circumstances,by members of all participating markets in opening transactions in thosemarkets.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\59\ 15 U.S.C. 78k-1(a)(3)(B) (1982). Trading through ITS occurs in the following manner. When a floor brokerreceives an order to buy or sell stock,\60\<NOTE/> he will compare the quotations in his market with the ITSdisplay of quotations from other markets. If the ITS display shows thatanother market has a superior quote, the broker may send the order throughthe ITS to that market.\61\<NOTE/> To do so, he   will send a ``commitment to trade,'' goodfor a specified amount of time (either one or two minutes), through theITS to that exchange. If the bid or offer is still good at the receivingmarket when the commitment arrives, the receiving member will send a responsethrough the ITS accepting the commitment. The ITS also is available forrouting proprietary orders between markets. Indeed, the System is oftenused by specialists on regional exchanges to ``lay off'' inventory positionsin the New York market. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\60\ Essentially all listed reported stocks which are multiplytraded are eligible for trading in the ITS. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\ The ITS Plan does not require that the order be routedto the market with the better quote. The order may be executed in the marketin which it is received, with that market often matching the better quote.The ITS has helped to prevent pricing disparities among the participatingexchanges and has helped to ensure that orders are not executed at an inferiorprice on one exchange while a superior price is available at another exchange.To this end, the ITS participants have adopted ``trade-through'' rules,which generally prohibit executing orders on one exchange if a superiorprice is available at a linked exchange,\62\<NOTE/> and a block trade policy.\63\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\62\ The rule is enforced by requiring an exchange memberwho has initiated a trade-through to: (1) Satisfy the superior bid or offerin a separate transaction with the exchange member whose quote has beentraded through; (2) to adjust the price of the transaction that constitutedthe tradethrough; or (3) to cancel the transaction. <T3>See </T3>Plan for the Purpose of Creating and Operating an IntermarketCommunications Linkage, Exhibit B. The ITS trade-through rule was approvedin Securities Exchange Act Release No. 17703 (April 9, 1981), 22 S.E.C.Doc. 707. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\63\ A block trade, for purposes of the policy, is a tradeinvolving 10,000 or more shares, or a market value of $200,000 or more,that is effected at a price outside the bid or offer displayed from anotherITS market. The ITS trade-through policy requires (subject to a numberof exceptions) that a member representing a block-size order send, at thetime of execution of a block trade, to each ITS market displaying a bid(offer) superior to the execution price a commitment to trade at the executionprice for the number of shares displayed with the superior quote. <T3>Id.</T3> An intermarket linkage system similar to the ITS was one of the marketintegration approaches suggested by the Commission in the Moratorium TerminationRelease. At that time, the Commission questioned whether such a systemwould work in the options environment because of the lack of firm quotes.According to the Commission: ``[t]he successful implementation of a marketlinkage system . . . is virtually entirely dependent upon the quality andreliability of quotation information disseminated by each market center.However, the Commission has received significant commentary that a firmquote rule . . . could not be applied to options.''\64\<NOTE/> At the same time, the Commission recognized that, even inthe absence of firm quotes, an intermarket linkage might help to reducepricing disparities between markets by facilitating arbitrage activityfrom the floors of the exchanges, and that it could provide a prompt andefficient means for options market makers to ``lay-off'' their order imbalances.\65\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\64\ Moratorium Termination Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 18, 45 FR at 21431. (footnote omitted) <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\65\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 21432 n.58.It appears that the lack of firm quotations is no longer the impedimentit once was to the development of an options intermarket linkage. The natureof quotation information has changed since the Commission considered theprospects for an inter-market linkage in the Moratorium Termination Release.As explained in the preceding section, the development by three optionsmarkets of automated small order execution systems, and the adoption bytwo options exchanges of trading policies requiring firm quotes, has shownthat the options markets now believe that options quotations provide asufficient basis for pricing orders of up to ten contracts. The Staff has examined sample equity options trading data to determinewhat proportion of all orders are for ten or fewer contracts. Data fora sample one week period, January 18-22, 1988, showed that approximately82% of all trades executed on the five options exchanges were for ten orfewer contracts. This data shows that a large proportion of equity optionsorders falls within the size range in which reliable quotations have beenshown to be possible.\66\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\66\ We recognize that the automated execution systems andthe trading policies described above provide firm pricing only for publiccustomer orders.  Although the absence of reliable quotes has been the principal conceptualimpediment to an intermarket linkage system for options, other objectionsalso have been raised. Critics have argued that such a linkage would betoo slow for the fast pace of options trading, and that it would provetoo    costly to route individual orders from one market to another inpursuit of the best price.\67\<NOTE/> Also, it has been argued that an intermarket linkage wouldnot lend itself to the kind of multiple component transactions, such asspreads and straddles, that are common in options trading.\68\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\67\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Statement of the Pacific Stock Exchange Incorporatedin Response to Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 34-24613(January 27, 1988), at 1 and Appendix A. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\68\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>CBOE response, <T3>supra </T3>note 38, at 26.  The Staff believes that these objections are, to a large extent, basedon erroneous assumptions regarding the necessary scope and trading capacityof such an intermarket linkage. For example, one of the exchanges respondingto proposed Rule 19c-5 observed that, while approximately 1,400 stocksare traded in the ITS today, a linkage for options might have to accommodateas much as all of the 21,000 individual options series traded on exchangestoday. Clearly, it is an exaggeration to expect that all_or even most_listedequity options will be multiply traded.\69\<NOTE/> Indeed, of the 449 OTC stocks eligible for options trading,only 103 (23%) have options overlying them, of which only 10 (9.7%) aremultiply traded. Moreover, even with respect to those that are multiplytraded, not all series would need to be eligible to be traded through the   linkage; participation in the linkage could be limited to the more activenear-term at-the-money series which are multiply-traded.\70\<NOTE/> Nor need the linkage necessarily support heavy trading tofulfill its purpose of preventing the adverse effects of market fragmentation.\71\<NOTE/> We recognize that such an intermarket linkage for optionswould not be able to accommodate multiple component transactions unlessit could be designed to allow for customized multiple component quotations.We believe, however, that the mere creation of an intermarket order routingchannel will be likely to prevent significant intermarket pricing disparities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\69\ The American Stock Exchange has suggested that the currentlottery system encourages the continued listing of lightly traded options,which, in a competitive environment, would tend to be ``pruned'' away bythe exchanges. Statement of The American Stock Exchange regarding MultipleTrading of Options, dated February 1, l988. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\70\ Equity option trading tends to be concentrated, withthe most activity occurring in a relatively small group of series. Forexample, data from August 15, 1988, (a randomly selected date) shows thattrading in the 100 most active series accounted for 39.6% of the totalcontract volume of that day, and trading in the 450 most active seriesaccounted for 70% of total contract volume. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\71\ We note that in 1987, daily average volume on the ITSwas a relatively modest 7,069 trades and 7,625,926 shares.  The cornerstone of such a system would be an undertaking among the exchangesto formalize and extend their current practices and guarantee executionsof agency orders routed through the system at each exchanges' current quotes.For example, the exchanges might agree to guarantee executions of up toten contracts for more actively traded options series and up to a lessersize, perhaps five contracts, for thinly traded series.The exchanges may wish to consider whether the linkage also should be availablefor routing larger agency orders, professional orders and even limit spreadorders, albeit without firm quotes. Such a system, like the ITS, wouldneed to provide for the display of composite quotation information at eachof the participating markets. It also should be designed for fast and efficientinput of orders, particularly in those markets with multiple market makers.In light of the fast pace of options trading, and the need to respond quicklyto price changes in the underlying stocks, an options linkage should, perhaps,require that orders sent through the system be accepted or rejected morequickly than is the case in the ITS. The options SROs also may wish toadopt default procedures to provide that an execution automatically occurwhen an order has not been accepted or rejected within the applicable timeperiod.\72\<NOTE/> An intermarket linkage for options need not, in the Staff'sview, be as elaborate as the ITS to achieve its desired effect. For example,the application of a trade-through rule may not be necessary at the inceptionof an options linkage.\73\<NOTE/> Also, for reasons that are discussed in the following section,it may not be practical to use such a linkage to coordinate market openings.Finally, an options linkage should be designed to be flexible so that optionscan quickly be added and deleted, in view of the fact that certain optionsmay be multiply traded for only a short time before a dominant market emergesand other markets delist.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\72\ <T3>Cf. </T3>Division of Market Regulation, <T3>The October 1987 Market Break </T3>(Feb. 1988) at 7-48 (suggestingthat ITS participants consider adopting default procedures). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\73\ A block trade policy, such as the ITS policy (described<T3>supra </T3>note 63), may not be appropriate in the options context.The requirement that market participants who execute block trades ``takeout'' superior quotes in other markets is premised on those quotes beingfirm. As noted above, however, the ``firmness'' of options quotes is changing,and if an options linkage facility were to be developed, the options marketsmay wish to consider developing special policies for handling large-sizedorders.  In sum, the Staff believes that it would be possible to develop a workableintermarket options order routing system that would, by enhancing bestexecution opportunities and providing a second level of competition amongthe exchanges, help to augment the beneficial effects of multiple trading.The Staff recommends that the options markets review the feasibility ofimplementing an intermarket order routing linkage for multiply-traded options.B. Small Order Switching Facility The second market integration measure that has been considered is a mechanismto route orders, on an order-by-order basis, to the ``best'' market. Thiscould be accomplished either by requiring brokerage firms to make order-by-orderrouting decisions, or by developing a switching facility to which all orderswould be sent for routing to the best market. In either event, this approachwould, like an inter-market linkage, also depend on the quality and reliabilityof quotation information. Implementation of an order-by-order routing approach would require a fundamentalchange in behavior on the part of brokerage firms, particularly large,retail-oriented firms, which generally select one primary market for thereceipt of most order flow. Absent a switch, requiring firms to route allorders one-by-one would be costly. Moreover, in accepting customer orders,brokerage firms assume certain fiduciary obligations to their customers,including the duty of ``best execution.''\74\<NOTE/> Critics of the order-by-order routing approach have arguedthat an order routing switch or rule would be too inflexible, and thatit would fail to take into account the fact that the quoted price aloneis not necessarily the only factor in determining where to obtain the bestexecution. For example, the market with the best quote at any particularmoment is not necessarily the one with the most depth and liquidity orthe most reliable execution and clearing services.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\74\ <T3>See </T3>Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(iv) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 78k1(a)(1)(C)(iV)(1982)]. Nevertheless, it may be possible to proceed with a market integration approachthat is based on limited order-by-order routing for small customer orders,that does not require development of a central switching facility or individualorder routing decisions by firms, and that is based on modification andexpansion of existing exchange facilities. As explained above in connectionwith the nature of quotation information, the CBOE and Amex have developedautomated execution systems  which provide executions of retail ordersat the best bid or offer available on each exchange at the time of orderentry. If the markets that do not currently have automated execution capabilitiesbuild such systems, these systems could be linked and modified to includea message switch on each. Incoming orders in options that are traded onboth exchanges would be automatically retained for execution or routedto the other exchange's system, depending on which exchange was then offeringthe best price.\75\<NOTE/> The Staff believes that this type of linkage would reducefurther the possibility of pricing disparities between markets. While sucha system would remove the firm's opportunity to use its best judgementas to how to achieve best execution of its customers' orders, the systemmay provide greater benefits than are available through the exercise ofsuch judgment. For example, firms employing options automatic executionsystems already have determined that the advantages of an assured quote-basedexecution of its customers' orders exceed the potential benefits of achievinga superior execution between the quotation spread. A switching facilitywould provide execution of customer orders at the best disseminated quotein a multiply traded environment. Moreover, because orders automaticallywould be directed to the market with the best price (where they would beguaranteed an  execution), this type of linkage would greatly enhance opportunitiesfor competition among markets. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\75\ The NASD's Small Order Execution System (``SOES'') operatesin a manner similar to this. Orders entered into SOES are automaticallyexecuted against either the market maker displaying the best bid or offer,or the market maker designated by the firm entering the order. Accordingly, the Staff recommends that the options markets review the feasibilityof developing a procedure to route customer market and marketable limitorders of up to ten contracts to the market disseminating the best bidor offer (as the case may be) and provide a guarantee of execution foragency orders at that price. The system need not be mandatory, but couldbe offered as a voluntary alternative to firms who wished both to ensuretheir customer's order an execution at the best disseminated quotationand, at the same time, encourage quote competition among options markets.C. Central Limit Order File The third market integration measure that has been considered in connectionwith multiple trading is a central limit order exposure system_an electronicfacility for collecting, displaying, and providing automatic executionof, limit orders in multiply traded options. If successfully implemented,a central limit order system would have the potential to enhance fair competitionamong brokers and dealers and among markets, to provide inter-market orderinteraction and thereby reduce market fragmentation, and to ensure thatpublic customer limit orders are protected and are not bypassed by professionalor institutional orders executed on other markets.As already mentioned, the Commission asked the options exchanges to considersuch a facility when the Moratorium was lifted in 1980. The Commissionenvisioned an electronic facility which would (1) allow brokers to enterand retrieve public limit orders directly; \76\<NOTE/> (2) queue orders for execution on the basis of price/timepriority; (3) provide on each options exchange a display summary of ordersin the system; (4) provide floor members on each options exchange an equalopportunity to execute automatically against orders in the system; and(5) provide the floor member executing against the limit order and thebroker entering the order an immediate execution report.\77\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\76\ Although the Commission suggested that only public limitorders be included in the system, it invited the SROs to consider whetherall limit orders should be included. Moratorium Termination Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 18, 45 FR at 21432 n.59. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\77\ <T3>Id.</T3>The task force formed by the exchanges reasoned that the effectivenessof a limit order exposure system in addressing the concerns associatedwith multiple trading would depend on the extent to which the system wasused, <T3>i.e.</T3>, on the proportion of order flow affected by the system.In an attempt to predict this, the task force examined the extent to whichlimit orders were then used in options trading and the extent to whichthese limit orders were in fact ``booked'' with the specialist or orderbook official. The task force found that while limit orders were widelyused in options trading, they  often were not ``booked.'' The task forceexplained that limit orders were used in different ways and for differentreasons in options trading than they traditionally had been in the equitymarkets. An equity investor typically would use a limit order when he wishedto buy at a price below, or sell at a price above, the prevailing marketprice, and the order generally would be ``booked.'' An options investor,on the other hand, would often use a limit order even when willing to tradeat the current market price, to protect against an unfavorable execution.Such orders typically would not be ``booked'' for the same reason thatthey were placed to begin with_because of the danger of receiving an unfavorableexecution before being able to retrieve an order from the book. In sum,the task force concluded that, because of the manner and extent to whichlimit orders were used in options trading, a central limit order exposuresystem would not be likely to address fair competition and market fragmentationconcerns.\78\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\78\ Having reached this conclusion, the task force did notproceed to what was to have been the second phase of its effort_considerationof technological and cost factors associated with a limit order exposuresystem.The Staff believes that the options SROs should reexamine the prospectsfor a central limit order exposure system. The circumstances under whichoptions are traded have changed considerably since the options exchangesexamined this issue in 1980/81.\79\<NOTE/> Technological developments such as the implementation ofelectronic limit order books at the NYSE, and the development by the NASDof a limit order processing and execution capability for SOES,\80\<NOTE/> have shown that a central limit order system is now operationallyfeasible. While the Staff is unable to estimate the actual percentage oflimit orders which would be entered into such a system, the ability toparticipate in trades in other markets would appear to provide a powerfulincentive for routing orders to the system. In addition, such a systemwould permit participants in each competing market to have access to allbooked limit orders. Accordingly, a limit order system potentially couldincrease opportunities for market-maker competition and provide nationwideprice protection for all limit orders. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\79\ We note that the advent of guaranteed executions of retailorders up to a certain size at an exchange's best price (either throughautomated execution systems or exchange trading policies) may have changedthe way in which limit orders are used in options trading. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\80\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26476 (January 19, 1989),54 FR 3881. Consideration of a central limit order system would raise a number of policyand technical considerations. A threshold question is which limit ordersshould be included in the system; that is, whether only public orders shouldbe eligible, and whether there ought to be a limitation on the size oforders (public or other) that could be entered. The Staff is inclined tobelieve that the system, at least initially, should  be limited to publiccustomer orders because of the heightened concerns regarding the executionof public customer orders in a multiple trading environment. In addition,the Staff believes that limiting the availability of the system to publiccustomers will reduce concerns over the impact of any such file on thestructure of the existing trading markets and therefore will enable theexchanges to more easily design and implement such a system. A closely related issue is what rules of protection or priority shouldapply to orders entered into the system in relation to other orders. Forexample, limit orders entered into the system could be given priority overany options order elsewhere at the same price; in other words, all proposedoptions transactions would be required to clear the limit order systembefore or upon being executed.\81\<NOTE/> In the alternative, limit orders entered into the systemcould be provided price protection so that orders outside the system couldnot be executed at inferior prices unless limit orders at superior pricesin the system were satisfied.\82\<NOTE/> The Staff believes that any system that may be developedshould provide, at a minimum, price protection for public limit orders.\83\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\81\ The rules of the CBOE (which allows only public customerlimit orders to be entered into the exchange's limit order books) providefor such preferential treatment of public limit orders. CBOE Rules 6.45and 7.4. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\82\ The rules of the Amex (which allows both public and professionalorders to be entered into the exchange's limit order books) provide forsuch protection of ``booked'' limit orders. Amex Rule 155. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\83\ We understand, however, that it may be desirable to provideexceptions from price protection or priority rules for spread transactions,to the same extent that exchange rules currently exempt such transactions.<T3>See</T3> CBOE Rule 6.45(d) and Amex Rule 950(d), Commentary .01. Priority rules with respect to orders in the system also would have tobe established. The most likely alternative would be for orders to be queuedon the basis of price first, and then time of entry into the system. Thecontent of these intra-system priority rules also would depend, however,on what type of limit orders are eligible to be entered into the system.For example, if proprietary orders of brokers and dealers could be enteredinto the system, it may be desirable to afford priority to public customerlimit orders. Among the more technical considerations would be how to design the systemto provide maximum flexibility and speed in functions such as entering,retrieving or updating orders, and generation of execution reports to allparties to a transaction. The Staff believes that a central limit order system has the potentialto alleviate the concerns associated with multiple trading, and recommendsthat the options markets review the feasibility of implementing such asystem.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Market Openings </ITAG>Concern over pricing disparities in a multiple trading environment hasoften been focused on market openings.\84\<NOTE/> It is at that point in the trading day, in theory, that differingmixes of buy and sell orders among markets are most likely to produce significantpricing disparities. Indeed, the early experience with multiple trading,before the imposition of the Moratorium, produced several dramatic instancesof disparate pricing at the opening.\85\<NOTE/> Despite the potential for pricing disparities at the opening,however, the Commission staff studies of multiple trading of options onOTC stocks failed to reveal any significant pricing problems at the opening.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\84\ Options market openings differ from openings in stocks.The various series in a given options class are opened in a set sequence,in a practice known as the ``opening rotation.'' Options openings do notbegin until the underlying stock has been opened. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\85\ <T3>See supra </T3>note 36 and accompanying text. To ascertain how much of daily trading potentially could be affected bywhatever pricing problems that do occur, the Staff has sought to determinewhat proportion of daily trading takes place at the opening. Data for twosample weeks, the weeks of September 28 to October 2, 1987, and January18 to 22, 1988, showed that trades executed before 10 a.m.\86\<NOTE/> accounted for 8.2% and 9.2% respectively of the daily numberof trades, and for 7.6% and 6.4% respectively of daily contract volume. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\86\ The period of up to 10 a.m. is, perhaps, over-inclusiveas a measure of trading that occurs at the opening. The Staff has considered, but does not currently recommend, a number ofpossible measures to coordinate market openings in options. For example,an inter-market order and message routing linkage, as discussed in thepreceding section, could include a pre-opening application to share orderimbalance information and to allow markets to participate in each other'sopenings. ITS, for example, provides such an application for stocks. Inlight of the derivative nature of options, however, the number of differentseries involved, and the differences between unitary specialist and multiplemarket maker trading systems, the Staff recognizes that such an arrangementmight prove too cumbersome and time-consuming in the options context. Another possibility considered by the Staff would be to designate one marketto open trading, with the designation perhaps rotating among competingmarkets. The drawback with this solution is that it would provide the marketchosen to do the opening an unwarranted competitive advantage. If the designationwere to be changed frequently, it could result in public investor confusionand costly operational changes for member firms. Moreover, if the designationwere rotated, nonprimary markets might not have sufficient order flow orcapital to properly price each option series. Multiple trading of options on OTC stock has not produced significant pricingdisparities at the opening. The Staff believes that coordination at theopening among markets trading the same option may only be necessary whenthere are unusual market conditions. For these instances, the options exchangesshould establish means of assured communications, such as dedicated telephonelines or electronic mail facilities between trading posts in the competingmarkets. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Conclusion </ITAG>The Commission has found that multiple trading of options is likely tobring benefits to investors that will substantially outweigh any adverseconsequences of market fragmentation, even in the absence of integrationfacilities among markets. The Staff believes that it would be possibleto devise integration measures that would address the concerns associatedwith market fragmentation. The Staff believes that the options markets should avail themselves ofthe advance notice provided and the Commission's policy of phased-in implementationof Rule 19c-5 to consider developing market integration facilities. TheStaff is committed to working closely with the options markets in theirevaluation of the feasibility of such facilities.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
