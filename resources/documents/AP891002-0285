(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Johnny Lee was an unknown honky-tonkperformer before his song ``Lookin' for Love'' from the movie``Urban Cowboy'' climbed the charts.   His stardom, though, was merely a blink in time. His career,finances and personal life all plunged, and now he's trying toregain some of what he lost.   He has a 10-album contract with Curb Records. He's sellinganother LP, ``Woods andamp; Water,'' through TV marketing. His biography,``Lookin' for Love,'' has just been published by Diamond Books.   ``The negative stuff is in the past,'' Lee said. ``Things arepositive now. I look forward to making good records, having afamily, being happy and healthy and being alive.''   When ``Urban Cowboy,'' with John Travolta and Debra Winger, cameout in 1980, Lee's ``Lookin' for Love'' became a hit on both thecountry music and pop charts. Another song, ``Cherokee Fiddle,''was also on the movie's soundtrack LP, which sold 3 million copies.   He and his country buddy, Mickey Gilley, came to representcountry chic in their snappy cowboy hats, spiffy Western shirts andexpensive cowboy boots. They appeared on TV shows such as ``FantasyIsland,'' ``CHIPs,'' ``The Dukes of Hazzard'' and ``The Fall Guy.''And Lee married actress Charlene Tilton, who portrayed Lucy Ewingon TV's ``Dallas.''   Today, he and Gilley are hardly friends. He went four yearswithout making a record. All the money he thought he made duringhis peak years has vanished. He and Tilton divorced. They had achild, Cherish Lee, 7.   ``I lost everything except my talent,'' the 43-year-old singersaid. ``I never saw a dime.''   Lee has since remarried, to Deb Lee in November 1986. Thatmarriage was a year after he released ``Keep Me Hanging On,'' hislast album until this fall's ``New Directions.''   For reasons still unclear to Lee, no record company wanted him.   ``I felt absolutely useless,'' he said. ``My dignity was takenaway. I just worked jobs at clubs here and there _ did whatever Icould do. It was quite devastating for a while.''   Lee was a nightclub singer in the Houston area when he waschosen to sing ``Lookin' for Love'' in the ``Urban Cowboy'' movie.   ``Everybody related to it,'' he said. ``It's a meaningful,simple song. To this day, everyone still knows the words to thatsong.''   He followed it with hit records such as ``One in a Million,''``Pickin' Up Strangers,'' ``You Could've Heard a Heart Break'' and``Yellow Rose,'' which also was the theme song for the former TVseries.   But he had trouble getting money he felt was due him from hiscareer. An associate who was handling money Lee earned fromperforming told him the money had been deposited in safe accounts,but when Lee tried to get his money back he was unable to do so. Hehired lawyers to try to get the money, but legal fees mounted andhe finally could afford them no longer. He gave up.   ``I was ready to get on with my life and start over. That's whatI had to do, start over,'' he said.   He and Gilley went their separate ways under strainedcircumstances, Lee said, because Gilley apparently felt Lee didn'tsupport him in his own legal battles.   ``I still think the world of Mickey,'' Lee said. ``I love himlike a brother. But I've called him numerous times and he's neverreturned my calls. I'm a little let down with him. It hurts me tothink so much of someone ... you can only do that for so long. Ifthey don't think the same about you, what are you going to do?   ``I still think he's a great talent and a great guy and I missthe relationship we had.''   Lee estimates that he owns at least 100 cowboy hats.   ``I just always have worn them,'' he said. ``All the clothes Ihave go with them.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Oct. 13-15</NOTE></DOC>
