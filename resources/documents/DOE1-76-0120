One of the principal advantages of the dynamic method isthat the high pressures, densities, and internal energies achieved aredetermined simply by the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy.Diagnostic techniques have been developed to measure the properties ofmaterials at high dynamic pressure during the experimental lifetime,which is generally less than 1 {mu}s. Shock compression is an irreversibleprocess accompanied by heating, which must be taken into account in theanalysis of experimental data and in relating shock-compression datato states achieved by static compression methods. The purpose of thispaper is to describe briefly the phenomenology of shock compression,to discuss how shock data for metals have been used to generate the pressurescales for all static-compression experiments above -- 5 GPa, and todescribe ways in which shock compression might potentially be used tosynthesize and/or process into useful form novel materials like the newhigh-T/sub c/ superconducting oxides.</TEXT></DOC>
