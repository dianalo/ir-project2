One cartoon posted in the manufacturing-engineering office at GM's suburban-Detroit Technical Center shows a huge toilet with a long drain and an arrow pointing at the drain's end. &quot;You are here,&quot; says the caption. Another cartoon depicts a middle-aged man sitting at a kitchen table with his wife and kids. &quot;I have called this meeting,&quot; the man is saying, &quot;to let you know that, because of the situation at GM, I will have to let some of you go.&quot;    The world's largest industrial company, which in the past year has battled soaring costs and sagging sales and which ousted dissident H. Ross Perot from its board of directors, now is fighting terrible morale. &quot;Morale is bad,&quot; concedes one executive who sits on the company's administration committee, &quot;and the lower you go in the organization, the worse it gets.&quot; The situation presents a major challenge for GM's new president, Robert C. Stempel, as the company continues to implement needed cost-cutting measures.    Lousy morale certainly isn't unique to GM, for white-collar layoffs are sweeping across America, changing long-held notions of job security and corporate loyalty for tens of thousands of people. But GM's situation is perhaps the most dramatic. Its managerial ranks have long been among the most secure in industrial America, immune even to the auto-industry depression of the early 1980s. But no more. As competition in the auto industry reaches unprecedented levels, many GM managers are reeling from three years of shocks that are disrupting careers and lives and spawning unaccustomed insecurity.    In 1984, Chairman Roger B. Smith announced a sweeping reorganization that thrust thousands of employees into new jobs in new locations with new bosses. Then, after GM's competitive inadequacies became apparent last year, the company launched a series of tough measures to regain fighting trim.    It abolished cost-of-living pay raises for white-collar workers. It replaced merit raises this year with lump-sum payments that don't increase the salary base. It is abandoning cash bonuses, a 70-year tradition. And most dramatic of all, it has launched a campaign to eliminate 25,000 white-collar employees this year and 15,000 more next year -- more than a quarter of its 146,500 salaried staffers.    &quot;We've got a lot of people sitting around wondering whether they'll be next,&quot; says Donald E. Hackworth, a vice president who heads a group of manufacturing plants. &quot;That's what gnaws on them.&quot; But he notes the even-worse alternative: eliminating all 40,000 jobs in one fell swoop.    Still, some measures have been crudely implemented. In March, GM announced a $5 billion-plus stock-buyback program during the very week it was informing middle managers about the switch to lump-sum payments. Many GM managers fear that an across-the-board suspension of merit pay will prompt talented up-and-comers to go job-hunting.    Other companies are clearly looking at GM for executive talent. Lewis B. Campbell, a manufacturing manager for GM's Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada group, says his calls from headhunters have tripled since the April 16 cash-bonus announcement. The change &quot;scares the hell out of me,&quot; says Mr. Campbell, because 60% of his compensation comes from the bonus. Nonetheless, he says he accepts the need for tough measures and is sticking with GM because he believes that it won't let him suffer financially.    Like Mr. Campbell, many at GM say they understand its need to slim down. And many praise GM for trying to be humane. Departing managers can get severance benefits so generous -- 12 months' pay for those with seven to 10 years of service, for instance -- that they are being called the &quot;golden handshake.&quot; Those leaving also get comprehensive outplacement services, including seminars on developing entrepreneurial skills.    Nonetheless, even the most necessary, most humane measures can go down as bitter pills, and they can pose risks to GM as well. Some employees have become so consumed with who's leaving, and who might leave next, that they don't get much work done. &quot;I spend a lot of time on the phone talking to guys who have been canned or guys who want to leave,&quot; says a quality-control supervisor who confesses that his work has suffered. &quot;I call them, they call me. GM has become a giant water cooler.&quot;    What's more, some of the best managers -- those most able to land other jobs -- are leaving because they are disillusioned, even though GM isn't paying severance benefits to people it wants to keep. One is Hulki Aldikacti, the engineer behind GM's innovative Pontiac Fiero sporty car. &quot;You would think that with 650,000 employees, statistically GM would have one Leonardo da Vinci, 200 geniuses and 200,000 above-average people,&quot; says Mr. Aldikacti, now the president of a small engineering firm. &quot;Then why does GM have all these problems?&quot;    The answer, he suggests, is that GM's size makes it difficult to turn around. Mr. Aldikacti, who says he can be more effective at a smaller company, adds, &quot;I feel much better even though I didn't get a golden handshake.&quot;    Such departures could leave GM stuck with less talented people. &quot;It's very tricky and delicate,&quot; says Eugene Jennings, a Michigan State University management expert. &quot;You have to be prepared for one out of four that you want to keep to leave.&quot; He adds, however, that GM must pay that price. &quot;If Roger {Smith} tries to worry about morale too much, he'll get in trouble,&quot; he says. &quot;You simply have to understand there will be a lot of hurt people.&quot;    That there are, even though so far GM hasn't resorted to outright firings. Instead, managers have been told to select subordinates as candidates for &quot;voluntary&quot; departure; not enough employees are volunteering on their own. A manual urges the managers to use &quot;skill and compassion&quot; and to cite the need for GM's &quot;economic survival&quot; in 20-minute meetings with targeted employees. Then, the employees visit an outfit such as Mainstream Access Inc.    Mainstream is a New York firm that GM's Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada group hired to help persuade managers to leave -- and to ease the process. So extensive is this effort that GM retains two similar firms at other operations -- Drake, Beam andamp; Morin Inc., also of New York, and Jannotta, Bray andamp; Associates, based in Birmingham, Mich. The Troy, Mich., building where Mainstream has set up shop is owned by GM.    Inside are rooms called &quot;decision workshops,&quot; a huge hall that houses rows of cubbyholes with telephones as well as a library stocked with newspapers and help-wanted advertising from around the country. In one room, a long, gray wall is covered with neatly typed notices of available jobs. A white chalkboard hangs on an adjoining wall with names scribbled in colored chalk, the names of people who have landed jobs elsewhere.    &quot;The first reaction {of GMers sent to Mainstream} is to reject the idea of leaving GM,&quot; says Vincent Murray, who runs Mainstream's Troy office. &quot;We try to open them up for wanting a change and give them all the support they need to make the transition.&quot;    But Mr. Murray concedes that the task isn't always easy. He remembers one GM employee bursting into angry exchanges with a counselor and stalking out screaming. Another, he recalls, shouted, &quot;Hell, I never thought I'd say this, but maybe I'll buy a Toyota.&quot;    &quot;Some wonder how GM could do this to them,&quot; Mr. Murray adds, &quot;because they gave the company their life and blood. There's a lot of anger toward top management. People say, 'We trusted them, we thought they knew what they were doing, but it turns out they didn't.'&quot;    Several employees deride career counseling as nothing more than exercises in intimidation. &quot;I was basically told that if I didn't accept the {severance package}, I would be forced out or fired,&quot; says Edward Sova, a 38-year-old drive-train planner. He says he returned to his office and decided to stay at GM.    But that wasn't so simple. Mr. Sova says he, and seven other managers who didn't want to leave, were put in a specially created area that was bare except for desks and telephones. There he stayed nearly four months, doing homework for a course that he was taking at night, and, after finally deciding to leave, updating his resume and writing application letters.    &quot;I left because of the threat of being forced out,&quot; says Mr. Sova, who was hired last January as a program-control specialist by American Motors Corp. His new job may be uncertain because of Chrysler Corp.'s plan to acquire AMC.    Others, such as Dennis Balut, a 42-year-old draftsman who helps design car interiors, say they are determined to fight to stay. &quot;If I leave now, I will get an $800 monthly pension, but if I stay until I'm 65, in 2010, my pension would be $3,400 a month,&quot; Mr. Balut says. &quot;And where else would I get four weeks' vacation?&quot;    Mr. Balut, who earned $46,000 last year, hired a Detroit attorney, V. Paul Donnelly, to represent him. &quot;We do have an agreement in our policy and practice book that layoffs will be based on seniority,&quot; Mr. Balut explains. &quot;It isn't a contract, but it will hold up in court.&quot; Williams C. Brooks, general director of GM's personnel administration, however, says that the policy and practice book is &quot;an ever-changing document, changing as times change and practices change.&quot;    Meanwhile, Mr. Balut says that, for his defiance, he has been put at a desk &quot;in front of my boss's office&quot; along with four others refusing to leave GM. There, since March, they have been filing product-description manuals in binders. &quot;That's normally a messenger's job,&quot; Mr. Balut says. &quot;Right now, the bad part is sitting there the whole day, doing nothing. It gets to you; you get depressed.&quot;    James P. DeRonne is equally depressed. Last October, the 48-year-old engineer, who had been testing seat and body-panel tolerances, was asked to consider the voluntary-separation program, he says, but refused. In March, he was asked to take a week off to think about it. &quot;I told them I wouldn't change my mind,&quot; he says. Then, he was asked to go to Mainstream. He went. &quot;I told them they couldn't convince me to leave GM.&quot;    The world has changed for Mr. DeRonne since his return to his office after that day at the outplacement firm. Even though his pay has remained the same, Mr. DeRonne says he has been assigned to wipe grease off 50-gallon oil drums and cut test samples of sheet metal with a saw. &quot;I was finally given a torch, which I had never handled before,&quot; he says. &quot;I finished my job in three days, working my tail off. Then, they told me the job normally takes two days. If I had a gun, I would have used it.&quot;    Mr. DeRonne's plight is taking a toll on his family, which includes eight children. &quot;He isn't the same person anymore,&quot; Mrs. DeRonne says. &quot;The children want to go on a vacation, but he keeps putting it off. That's hard on the little kids who don't understand. And my 16-year-old daughter has been under so much pressure from school that she's ready to give up. She's crying that college education didn't do daddy any good.&quot;    GM's Mr. Brooks says the individual cases, such as Mr. Balut's or Mr. DeRonne's, are &quot;isolated,&quot; and adds that &quot;the intent of the {separation} program is not in any way to bring retribution to anyone who doesn't want to leave.&quot; While GM has a policy of not discussing individual cases such as Mr. DeRonne's, Mr. Brooks acknowledges that people who don't want to leave have been &quot;deployed&quot; in other &quot;activities&quot; available in their departments when their regular jobs have been eliminated. He says GM wants to avoid ill feeling among employees because &quot;we want to make sure that people who stay will be loyal employees.&quot;    Some GMers do like the severance packages. &quot;I saw this as a golden opportunity,&quot; says Charles Rowe, a 43-year-old quality inspector getting 20 months' pay for his 20 years at GM. &quot;Where would I get additional money like this?&quot; Mr. Rowe, who always wanted his own company, plans to start a consulting firm specializing in quality control.    Many others are leaving not because they see opportunities elsewhere but because they see few opportunities at GM. After more than 15 years at the company, one design manager decided to leave because, amid all the cutbacks, he didn't see any chance of being promoted soon, even though he had been rated &quot;immediately promotable&quot; in performance reviews.    He tried switching to another division, but the outlook there didn't appear any better. GM eventually gave him a severance package -- with less money than if the company had suggested his departure -- after he went all the way to a vice president to make his case. (Like some others, he asked not to be named because he has joined a firm doing business with GM.)    Amid the uncertainty and upheaval, a fiery motivational speaker named Michael Wickett has gained a following. The boyish-looking 43-year-old, who years ago went through his own bout of business failure and personal despair, has been hired by several GM departments to bolster morale. And some GM employees have followed him to seminars on self-esteem and goal-setting given without GM's sponsorship. On one recent evening at the nondenominational Church of Today, near GM's Technical Center, he told a full house, including a group of GMers: &quot;So what if morale is bad at GM! Repeat after me. I am not waiting. . . . Today is my day. . . . I feel good. . . . I feel great.&quot;    Mr. Wickett helped give David Lindsey, until recently senior administrator for technology planning at Chevrolet, the courage to cut the umbilical cord with GM. The 44-year-old Mr. Lindsey wasn't urged to leave, but he decided to anyway because he saw a better future elsewhere. He has started a marketing-consulting firm, Automotive Technologies Inc., in Troy to help supplier companies increase sales to the auto industry. &quot;It's hard to leave a company that has given you security and comfort all these years,&quot; he says. &quot;But the {auto} market has changed, and GM isn't competitive.&quot;    There's no way to measure how much low morale has hurt productivity at GM. But apparently it has, if only in the feeling that &quot;we don't work as a team like we used to,&quot; says Casimir Zachara, a 53-year-old design engineer.    Craig Barton, a 42-year-old engineer in GM's engineering and architecture department, attributes &quot;a lack of enthusiasm and attention&quot; to the increase in corrections that his group has to make on design projects. Both Messrs. Barton and Zachara say they have taken Dale Carnegie classes and have attended Mr. Wickett's seminars to improve their own attitudes; they say they now see opportunities as GM downsizes and restructures itself.    But not everyone can regain his enthusiasm. &quot;It's fairly common to see people spending time passing around newspaper clips {on GM} or standing idly around bulletin boards,&quot; says Mr. Rowe, the quality inspector leaving voluntarily. &quot;You know they aren't generating work.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
