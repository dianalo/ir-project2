The official Tanjug news agency later denied the reports, sayingAdem Demaqi remained in jail and had not yet served out a15-year-prison term he began in 1976.   Gunfire was heard overnight in Podujevo, a town 20 miles northof this provincial capital, as Albanians fired into the air tocelebrate the release of Demaqi, a dissident who has spent nearly29 years in jail for alleged separatist activity.   The release of Demaqi was one of the main demands byparticipants in large demonstrations that shook the region lastmonth during which at least 27 people died in clashes with riotpolice.   Pristina radio reported Sunday that authorities had releasedDemaqi, a 53-year-old sociologist who has been imprisoned almostcontinuously since 1959.   More than 20,000 people gathered to greet him in the village ofLjupce near Podujevo, and thousands more were were proceeding therein hope of seeing him, said Sefki Ukai, a local reporter.   Several hundred university students gathered early today aroundtheir dormitories in Pristina chanting ``Demaqi! Demaqi!'' and``Victory! Victory!''   About 20,000 ethnic Albanians marched through Decani, a townsome 45 miles west of Pristina, chanting ``Democracy! Democracy!''and demanding to speak to the authorities, local journalist sourcessaid.   Thousands of schoolchildren, who have boycotted classesthroughout the province for week, skirmished with police in severaltowns, but no casualties or arrests were reported.   Protesters are demanding free elections and greater autonomy forKosovo, a province of 1.9 million people, 90 percent of whom are ofAlbanian origin.   The authorities in Yugoslavia's largest republic of Serbia, ofwhich Kosovo is an administrative part, claim they must retaincontrol over the province to prevent what they describe as``harassment and persecution'' of the Serbian minority there byethnic Albanians.   They accuse Albanian ``terrorists and separatists'' of incitingunrest to allow Kosovo to secede from Yugoslavia and joinneighboring Albania.   In a related development, the trial of 15 prominent ethnicAlbanians accused of engaging in counter-revolutionary activitieswas adjourned today because the father of one of the defenseattorneys was killed during a clash Friday between security forcesand demonstrators.   ``If our lawyers and their kin are not safe, then we willdismiss them all and defend ourselves,'' Azem Vlasi, a formerCommunist Party head of Kosovo, told the court in Titova Mitrovica,30 miles north of Pristina.   The trial, which has been going on since last October, wasadjourned until next week, Vlasi's wife told The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
