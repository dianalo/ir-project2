Thursday's action, which does not affect depositors, brings thenumber of failed Sandamp;Ls under government management to 244 in 33states.   The institutions in the latest batch are in California, Florida,Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico and Tennessee.   They are:   _Sierra Federal Savings and Loan Association, Beverly Hills,Calif., with $49 million in assets.   _American Interstate Savings, Los Angeles, with $27 million inassets.   _Commonwealth Savings and Loan Association of Florida, Margate,Fla., with $1.68 billion in assets.   _Peoples Bank for Savings, Streator, Ill., with $53 million inassets.   _Parrish Federal Savings Bank, Denham Springs, La., with $15million in assets.   _New Mexico Federal Savings and Loan Association, Albuquerque,N.M., with $253 million in assets.   _Home Federal Savings and Loan Association, Memphis, Tenn., with$218 million in assets.   All seven institutions will be managed by the Federal DepositInsurance Corp., which insures commercial banks and under proposedbailout legislation would get new authority over the Sandamp;L agency.   The goal of the takeover program is to minimize losses and limitrisk until Congress provides the money to close the institutions orsubsidize their sale to new owners.   Negotiators from the House and Senate are working to presentPresident Bush with a finished bill before Congress leaves for itsAugust vacation.</TEXT></DOC>
