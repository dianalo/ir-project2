The European aircraft consortium also confirmed that its1991 profit was between two to three times that of 1990 andthat profitability should remain about the same level in1992.</LP><TEXT>   Airbus Industrie has never published financial accounts,but officials close to the group say that the consortium madea profit of about $100 million in 1990.   Airbus Industrie Chief Executive Jean Pierson said thegroup's 1991 profit came after repayments totaling $700million to the consortium's partners, which includeAerospatiale S.A. of France, Deutsche Airbus G.m.b.H., a unitof Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, British Aerospace PLC andConstrucciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.   The payments are for refundable loans that the partnersreceived from the governments to finance the development ofthe Airbus family of commercial aircraft.   This would suggest that Airbus Industrie was actually ableto turn in an operating profit of close to $1 billion in1991, a year that Mr. Pierson described as a &quot;catastrophe&quot;for the world airline industry.   Mr. Pierson said Airbus Industrie's revenue in 1992 shouldbe around the $7.7 billion recorded in 1991. That figure wasalmost 65% above the $4.68 billion of sales reported for1990, reflecting the steep rise in deliveries last year to163 planes from 95 in 1990.   The rise was partly due to Airbus catching up on deliverydelays caused by a protracted strike at British Aerospace,which makes wing sections for the Airbus family. Airbus plansto deliver 160 jets this year.   The 101 new orders booked last year together were worth$9.4 billion and were dominated by high-value widebody sales.Mr. Pierson observed that Airbus &quot;didn't do too badly&quot; in1991 despite the cancellation of 24 orders by airlines facingfinancial difficulties. All the planes have been reclassifiedwith other customers.   He said Airbus's target is still to capture 30% of theworld market for commercial jets in the 100 seat or morecategory, compared with 26% in 1991. Airbus took a 29% marketshare in the categories in which it actually competes.</TEXT></DOC>
