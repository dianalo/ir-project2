A federal jury found Eugene Laff, 52, former chairman of HaasSecurities Corp., guilty of five charges _ conspiracy, two countsof stock manipulation, mail fraud and obstruction of a Securitiesand Exchange Commission investigation.   The case in U.S. District Court in Manhattan was the firstinvestigation emanating from trading activity surrounding the Oct.19, 1987, crash.   Prosecutors had charged that the firm's scheme to artificiallyinflate the prices of penny stocks _ inexpensive securites tradedover the counter _ could not be maintained after the market dropand share prices tumbled.   Laff, of Greenwich, Conn., faces up to five years in prison anda $250,000 fine on each of the five counts when sentenced Feb. 15by Judge Thomas P. Griesa.   His attorney, John Lang, said he would likely appeal theconviction.   Prosecutors said Laff manipulated the stock prices by making itappear that the stocks were in demand, orchestrating purchasesthrough accounts controlled by Henry Lorin, the head of a smallinvestment company, and Stanley Aslanian, a former Haas trader andpresident.   Both Lorin and Aslanian pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperatewith prosecutors in the Laff case.   The defense had argued that Laff was unaware of any scheme toinflate prices. His attorney blamed the scheme on Lorin andAslanian.   Many of the witnesses during the two-month trial were Haascustomers who testified that they lost their life savings when thecompany collapsed.   Haas Securities was a 75-year-old firm that had 12,000 customersbefore going out of business nine days after the crash when it nolonger had enough capital to stay afloat.</TEXT></DOC>
