The Regulation requires banks to make funds available totheir customers within specified time frames and to disclose their fundsavailability policies to their customers. A number of states have alsoenacted laws governing funds availability. The Act (section 608) and RegulationCC (andSection;229.20) provide that any provision of state law in effecton or before September 1, 1989 that provides for a shorter hold for a categoryof checks than is provided under Federal law will supersede the Federalprovision.Provisions of state law governing funds availability that permit a bankto make funds available for withdrawal in a longer period than permittedunder Regulation CC are considered inconsistent and are preempted by RegulationCC. In addition, state disclosure and notice requirements concerning fundsavailability related to accounts covered by Regulation CC are preemptedby the Federal disclosure scheme. Regulation CC provides for Board determinationsof whether state law related to the availability of funds is preemptedby Federal law upon the request of a state, bank, or other interested party.The Board published for public comment a proposed preemption determinationwith respect to the Wisconsin funds availability law. (54 FR 5495, February3, 1989). The Board received two comments from the public on the proposedinterpretation. The Wisconsin Credit Union League requested that the interpretationbe broadened to cover the Wisconsin funds availability statutes applicableto credit unions and savings and loan associations. These statutes parallelthe state statute applicable to commercial banks. The final interpretationaddresses the extent to which the Federal law preempts the state laws governingfunds availability of deposits to accounts at commercial banks, savingsand loan associations, and credit unions.The comment received on behalf of the Wisconsin Bankers Association requestedthat the Board preempt entirely the state exceptions to the availabilityschedules and permit the use of the Federal exceptions, even where thestate schedule is not preempted by Regulation CC. Such an interpretationwould not be consistent with the Board's standards of preemption adoptedin its earlier preemption determinations and incorporated in the Commentaryto andSection;229.20(c) of Regulation CC. (See amendments to Regulation CCand Commentary, in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>). Therefore, the Board did not adopt this requestedrevision to the interpretation.The comment submitted on behalf of the Wisconsin Bankers Association alsosuggested that the state law requiring second-day availability for Treasurychecks and Wisconsin state and local government checks should supersedethe Federal law more broadly than provided for by the Board's proposeddetermination. Specifically, the commenter requested that the state's second-dayavailability requirement supersede Regulation CC not only to the extentthat it does not permit the use of a special deposit slip, but also tothe extent that it does not impose the other conditions to second-day availabilitythat are imposed by Federal law. The Board did not expand the circumstancesunder which state law requiring second-day availability of state and localgovernment checks supersedes Federal law because Federal law provides forsecond-day availability in these circumstances. First, the Regulation CCcondition to second-day availability that the check be deposited in anaccount held by a payee of the check is substantially similar to the statelaw condition that the check be endorsed only by the person to whom itwas issued. Second, the state law requires second-day availability onlyfor Wisconsin state and local government checks deposited in a Wisconsindepository institution. This meets the Federal condition that the checkbe deposited in a depositary bank located in the same state as the stateor local government that issued the check.Generally, Federal law preempts the Wisconsin funds availability requirements.Wisconsin law supersedes Regulation CC, however, with respect to in-statechecks that are defined as nonlocal under the Federal law, and with respectto state and local government checks, to the extent that fewer conditionsto prompt availability are required under the state law. Wisconsin lawcontinues to apply to the extent that it covers accounts or deposits notsubject to the Federal rules.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 229 </ITAG>Banks, Banking, Federal Reserve System.For the reasons set out in the preamble, 12 CFR Part 229 is amended asfollows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 229_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.

This preemption determination specifies those provisionsof the Wisconsin funds availability law that are not preempted by the Actand Regulation CC. (See also the Board's preemption determination regardingthe Uniform Commercial Code, section 4-213(5), pertaining to availabilityof cash deposits.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Wisconsin Statutes sections 404.213(4m), 215.136, and 186.117 requireWisconsin banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions, respectively,to make funds deposited in accounts available for withdrawal within specifiedtime frames. Generally, checks drawn on the U.S. Treasury, the State ofWisconsin, or on a local government located in Wisconsin must be made availablefor withdrawal by the second day following deposit. (The law governingcommercial banks determines availability based on banking day; the lawsgoverning savings and loan associations and credit unions determine availabilitybased on business days.) In-state and out-of-state checks must be madeavailable for withdrawal within five days and eight days following deposit,respectively. Exceptions are provided for new accounts and reason to doubtcollectibility. In addition, Wisconsin Statutes section 404.103 permitscommercial banks to vary these availability requirements by agreement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Coverage </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Wisconsin law defines ``account'', with respect to the rules governingcommercial banks, as ``any account with a bank and includes a checking,time, interest or savings account'' (Wisconsin Statutes section 404.104(1)(a)).The statutes relating to the funds availability requirements applicableto savings and loan associations and credit unions do not define the term``account.'' The Federal preemption of state funds availability requirementsapplies only to ``accounts'' subject to Regulation CC, which generallyconsist of transaction accounts. Regulation CC does not affect the Wisconsinlaw to the extent that the state law applies to deposits in savings, time,and other accounts (including transaction accounts where the account holderis a bank, foreign bank, or the U.S. Treasury) that are not ``accounts''under Regulation CC. (Note, however, that under andSection; 229.19(e) ofRegulation CC, <T3>Holds on Other Funds, </T3>the federal availability schedules may applyto savings, time, and other accounts not defined as ``accounts'' underRegulation CC in certain circumstances.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Wisconsin statute applies to ``items'' deposited in accounts.This term encompasses instruments that are not defined as ``checks'' inRegulation CC (andSection; 229.2(k)), such as nonnegotiable instruments,and are therefore not subject to Regulation CC's provisions governing fundsavailability. Those items that are subject to Wisconsin law but are notsubject to Regulation CC will continue to be covered by the state availabilityschedules and exceptions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Availability Schedules </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Temporary schedule. </T3>The Wisconsin statute requires that in-statenonlocal checks be made available for withdrawal not later than the fifthday following deposit (Wisconsin Statutes sections 404.213(4m)(b)(2); 215.136(2)(b);186.117(2)(b)). This time period is shorter than the seventh business dayavailability required for nonlocal checks under andSection; 229.11(c) ofRegulation CC, although it is not shorter than the schedules for nonlocalchecks set forth in andSection; 229.11(c)(2) and Appendix B-1 of RegulationCC. Thus, the state schedule for in-state nonlocal checks supersedes theFederal schedule to the extent that it applies to an item payable by aWisconsin bank that is defined as a nonlocal check under Regulation CCand is not subject to reduced schedules under andSection; 229.11(c)(2) andAppendix B-1. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Permanent Schedule. </T3>Under the Federal permanent availability schedule,nonlocal checks must be made available for withdrawal not later than thefifth business day following deposit. The fifth day availability requirementfor in-state items in the Wisconsin statute supersedes the Regulation CCtime period adjustment for withdrawal by cash or similar means in the permanentschedule, to the extent that the in-state checks are defined as nonlocalunder Regulation CC.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Next-day availability</T3>. Under the Wisconsin statute, the proceedsof state and local government checks must be made available for withdrawalby the second day following deposit, if the check is indorsed only by theperson to whom it was issued (Wisconsin Statutes sections 404.213(4m)(b)(1);215.136(2)(b); and 186.117(2)(a)). Regulation CC requires next-day availabilityfor these checks if they are (1) deposited in an account of a payee ofthe check, (2) deposited in a depositary bank located in the same stateas the state or local government that issued the check, (3) deposited inperson to an employee of the depositary bank, and (4) deposited with aspecial deposit slip, if the depositary bank informed its customers thatuse of such a slip is a condition to next-day availability. Under the Federallaw, if a state or local government check is not deposited in person toan employee of the depositary bank, but meets the other conditions setforth in andSection; 229.10(c)(1)(iv), the funds must be made available forwithdrawal not later than the second business day following deposit. TheWisconsin statute supersedes Regulation CC to the extent that the statelaw does not permit the use of a special deposit slip as a condition toreceipt of second-day availability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Exceptions to the schedules</T3>. Wisconsin law provides exceptionsto the state availability schedules for new accounts (those opened lessthan 90 days) and reason to doubt collectibility (Wisconsin Statutes sections404.213(4m)(b); 215.136(2); and 186.117(2)). The state availability lawalso permits commercial banks to vary the funds availability requirementsby agreement (Wisconsin Statute section 404.103(1)). In all cases wherethe Federal schedule preempts the state schedule, only the Federal exceptionsapply. For deposits that are covered by the state availability schedule(e.g., in-state nonlocal checks), a state exception must apply in orderto extend the state availability schedule up to the Federal availabilityschedule. Once the deposit is held up to the Federal availability limitunder a state exception, the depositary bank may further extend the holdonly if a Federal exception can be applied to the deposit. Any time a depositarybank invokes an exception to extend a hold beyond the time periods otherwisepermitted by law, it must give notice of the extended hold to its customerin accordance with andSection; 229.13(g) of Regulation CC.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Business day/banking day</T3>. The definitions of ``business day''and ``banking day'' in the Wisconsin statutes are preempted by the RegulationCC definition of those terms. For determining the permissible hold underthe Wisconsin schedules that supersede the Regulation CC schedule, depositsare considered available for withdrawal on the specified number of ``businessdays'' following the ``banking day'' of deposit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Wisconsin law considers funds to be deposited, for the purpose ofdetermining when they must be made available for withdrawal, when an itemis ``received at the proof and transit facility of the depository.'' Forthe purposes of this preemption determination, funds are considered depositedunder Wisconsin law in accordance with the rules set forth in andSection;229.19(a) of Regulation CC.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Disclosures</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Wisconsin statute does not require disclosure of a bank's fundsavailability policy. The state law does require, however, that a bank givenotice to its customer if it extends the time within which funds will beavailable for withdrawal due to the bank's doubt as to the collectibilityof the item (Wisconsin Statutes sections 404.213(4m)(b); 215.136(2); and186.117(2)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Regulation CC preempts state disclosure requirements concerning fundsavailability that relate to ``accounts'' that are inconsistent with theFederal requirements. The state requirement is different from, and thereforeinconsistent with, the Federal disclosure rules (andSection; 229.20(c)(2)).Thus, the Wisconsin statute is preempted by Regulation CC to the extentthat the state notice requirement applies to ``accounts'' as defined byRegulation CC. The Wisconsin requirement would continue to apply to accounts,such as savings and time accounts, not governed by the Regulation CC disclosurerequirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,March 31, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William W.
