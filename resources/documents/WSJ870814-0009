Garcia</HL><DD> 08/14/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   The fifth anniversary of the bull market was marked with yet another record-setting move as stock prices rose in active trading yesterday.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 22.17 points to 2691.49 surpassing its two-day-old record of 2680.48. This week alone, the average has gained nearly 100 points. The bull's run on Wall Street has added 246.4% to the industrial average in the past five years.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index moved up 2.26 to 334.65, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.27 to 186.97, both records. There were 961 issues advancing and 695 declining on the Big Board.    Despite the birthday, it was business as usual at the New York Stock Exchange -- no cards thrown in the air, no champagne corks popping. Volume was strong but slower than earlier in the week; 217.1 million shares were traded, compared with 235.8 million shares Wednesday.    Yesterday's advance in the stock market was accompanied for the first time this week with a rally in the bond market. Much of the gains in the bond market came late in the day on reports that there was strong demand for the Treasury's offering of $9.01 billion of 30-year bonds.    The advance also lifted the Nasdaq OTC composite index and the American Stock Exchange's Major Market index to highs.    While traders still said that demand from domestic and foreign investors continued to push stock prices higher, the market got an added push from buy programs tied to stock-index futures. A midafternoon flurry that briefly put the Dow Jones Industrial Average over 2700 was driven by futures-related programs, traders said.    Some traders also said that Japanese investors are starting to take some profits.    For the time being, many market professionals believe that there is cash in investors' hands that can propel stock prices to still loftier levels. Peter DaPuzzo, a senior executive vice president in charge of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said &quot;There's still plenty of capital chasing fewer and fewer shares.&quot;    One trader in the over-the-counter market said he quickly found buyers for a million shares of a stock that is usually very thinly traded. &quot;This is getting to be too easy,&quot; he added.    However, Mr. DaPuzzo noted that the slate of new stock offerings is just starting to build, which could bring a lot more shares to the market quickly. He added that the new offerings would become especially troublesome for the market when weak, highly speculative firms decide it is a good time to go public.    Robert Robbins, a market strategist with Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta, believe the media hype surrounding the fifth anniversary of the bull market may be luring some investors into the stock market. One New York broker said he was getting calls from clients he hadn't heard from in quite a while.    Among yesterday's gainers were auto stocks. General Motors added 1 1/2 to 91 1/2, Ford Motor rose 5/8 to 109 1/8 and Chrysler gained 1 1/8 to 44 1/2. Early August car sales rose 12% from a year earlier, helped by financing incentives.    The Commerce Department reported that July retail sales rose a larger-than-expected 0.8%. Some economists said the report could be misleading because much of the July increase was the result of auto sales. But because car dealers are selling inventories on hand, the higher sales are doing nothing to stimulate production.    Putting this view of the numbers aside, retailing stocks moved higher. Sears Roebuck gained 3/8 to 58 3/4, J.C. Penney rose 1 5/8 to 65 1/8, Limited added 3/8 to 50 1/2 and May Department Stores moved up 3/4 to 49 5/8.    Federated Department Stores advanced 2 1/8 to 57 3/4. Some attributed the advance in the stock to rumors of a leveraged buyout or another transaction to take the company private.    Caesars World dropped 4 5/8 to 30 1/2 on trading of about 1.3 million shares after opening for trading at 3:15 p.m. EDT. Late Wednesday the New Jersey Casino Control Commission voted down Caesars' recapitalization plan, saying it &quot;lacks any clear business purpose&quot; and would burden the company &quot;with staggering debt.&quot;    Caesars' plan calls for each shareholder to receive a one-time cash dividend of $26.25 per share and one share in the reconstituted company.    Among airline stocks, Allegis rose 1 1/4 to 95 1/2. United Airlines' pilots union, which has been trying to buy the air carrier from Allegis, said Chemical Bank has agreed to syndicate the bank financing necessary to complete the purchase.    Although precious metals prices tumbled in the futures markets on profit-taking, gold, silver and other mining stocks were only slightly lower.    After the close, Ivanhoe Partners, owned by affiliates of Mesa Limited Partnership, NRM Energy L.P. and Harbert Corp., said it has acquired a 9.1% stake in Newmont Mining and may seek to acquire the company or gain a position on its board. Newmont Mining fell 1/4 to 77.    Jim Walter moved up 1 3/8 to 59 7/8. The company accepted an acquisition offer of $60 a share from an investor group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.    Manpower slid 2 1/4 to 76 in active trading. The company is considering adopting a poison pill measure and is in talks to acquire several temporary-help firms in Europe. Such moves could thwart Blue Arrow's $1.21 billion tender offer for Manpower.    Utah Power andamp; Light gained 3 5/8 to 30 1/8 on trading of more than one million shares after agreeing to be acquired by PacifiCorp in a stock swap. PacifiCorp fell 7/8 to 35.    Harcourt Brace Jovanovich slipped 1/2 to 10 1/4. The book publisher disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that the regulatory agency is investigating its $3 billion recapitalization plan.    Matsushita Electric rose 2 5/8 to 178 1/4. An article in yesterday's Wall Street Journal reported that analysts in Japan are strongly recommending the stock, saying it has done well in adjusting to the higher yen. In the U.S., analysts are urging the sale of Matsushita's American depositary shares because of expectations of an increase in the yen, which would make it harder for the electronics concern to sell its products outside of Japan.    Tiffany climbed 2 1/4 to 32 after the jewelry maker and retailer reported that fiscal second-quarter earnings surged.    Computer Factory lost 1 to 24. The company reported that earnings for the fiscal third quarter rose to 13 cents a share from eight cents a year earlier. A company official told Dow Jones News Service that some Wall Street analysts had expected earnings to triple from a year earlier.    Arrow Electronics added 1 1/8 to 9 1/2. The stock was recommeded by Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. </TEXT></DOC>
