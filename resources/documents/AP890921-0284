BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With Thursday's announcement of the state's 113thbank closing this year, Texas tied last year's record on a scorecardof failure that experts say may slow, but won't end, for severalyears.   ``We believe that 1990 is going to show a slight increase in thenumber of independently chartered banks that fail,'' said TexasBanking Commissioner Kenneth Littlefield. But ``we will continue tohave bank failures for two more years that are the result of pastlending decisions.''   ``We have seen the peak as far as the absolute numbers areconcerned,''added Sandy Flannigan, a Houston-based analyst forPaineWebber Inc.   Nationally, the numbers should remain about the same next year,according to Alan Whitney, a spokesman for the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. in Washington, D.C.   The failures will continue, Whitney said, ``even though theeconomy in Texas and other parts of the Southwest has begun tostabilize somewhat, because changes in the banking industry alwayslag from 18 months to 24 months.''   On Thursday, Littlefield shut down Rose Capital Bank in Tyler.   The bank, which had assets of $64.6 million and deposits of about$61.1 million, was purchased by First City Bancorp of Texas Inc. for$25,000. First City also will purchase about $46.4 million of RoseCapital's assets.   The FDIC will provide $16.8 million in assistance, and retainassets with a book value of $18.2 million.   The 113 Texas failures this year included 20 involved in thefederal seizure of MCorp banks and 24 from the shutdown of banksowned by Texas American Bancshares Inc.   The number does not include the 12 banks of National BancsharesCorp. of Texas that were bought by Equimark Corp. of Pittsburgh in afederally assisted transaction.   Last year's 113 included 40 banks taken over from FirstRepublicBank Corp. Those banks became NCNB Texas National Bank,which remains the state's largest bank.   Nationally, Rose Capital was the 160th failure this year, a hugejump from 10 years ago. Ten banks failed each year from 1979 to 1981and ``we thought it was Armageddon,'' the FDIC's Whitney said.   Since then, the numbers have grown each year: 42 in 1982, 48 in1983, 80 in 1984, 120 in 1985, 138 in 1986, 184 in 1987 and 200 lastyear.   Although regulators frequently cite poor management andinadequate supervision as reasons for specific failures, RobertRieke, a banking analyst at Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc. in Dallas,said regulators themselves are partially at fault.   He said that from 1982 to 1985 ``the regulators justindiscriminately approved bank charters and these bankingorganizations never had the opportunity to grow in size.''   Rieke predicted it would take five years to clean the slate.   Littlefield, who took over as Texas banking commissioner threeyears ago, said, ``In hindsight, it's easy to make that conclusion:that there were too many banks chartered.''</TEXT></DOC>
