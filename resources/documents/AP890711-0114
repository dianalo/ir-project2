America stands with you,'' he said,renewing his pledge to help the Poles redeem their shattered economyand seek greater political freedoms. ``America stands shoulder toshoulder with the Polish people in solidarity.''   ``Long live Bush!'' came back the reply from the crowd of 25,000people. Another 25,000 lined the streets of this seaport to cheerBush's motorcade, and some threw flower petals at his limousine.   The president was introduced to the chanting, flag-wavingaudience by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who said he hoped thevisiting American realized ``our country should and deserves to behelped. ... God Bless America. May God bless our homeland,'' Walesasaid.   The speech concluded, Bush and Walesa stood together to acceptthe cheers of the crowd, then turned to the monument to slainworkers and held up their hands in a V-for-Victory sign favored bythe union movement.   Later, Bush flew to Hungary, another Communist country in thethroes of extraordinary political and economic reform. He travels toParis on Thursday for the economic summit, followed by a trip nextweek to the Netherlands.   Scrapping his prepared text in Budapest, Bush told the crowd thatwaited in the rain in Kossuth Square to greet him: ``I salute theleaders oif Hungary. I salute the reforms and change that is takingplace in this wonderful country.''   ``We want to work with Hungary to continue the changes andreforms,'' said Bush.   After the shipyard speech, Bush joined Communist Party leaderWojciech Jaruzelski and laid a wreath at the Westerplatte Monumentcommemorating where the first shots of World War II were fired.   At the airport, Jaruzelski hailed the departing president as ``anexperienced and far-sighted statesman who attracts warm feelings,''and thanked him for ``the sincere and partner-like character of thetalks we held. We have sown new seeds.''   Bush made the trip to the Solidarity Workers Monument outside themain gate to the Lenin shipyard after a private lunch at Walesa'shome.   The president said Walesa had asked for private investmentassistance in their talks. ``I can give strong support for thatstanding right here in his yard,'' Bush said.   Later, introducing Bush at the Solidarity monument, Walesa saidPoland needs help to keep its economic reforms from failing. If thathappened, he said, ``it would be a failure of democracy'' and wouldhave a destabilizing effect throughout Eastern Europe.   On Monday, Bush had outlined a program of $115 million in U.S.aid and proposed easier repayment terms for Poland's $39 billioninternational debt.   He said he would take Walesa's call for private investment to theeconomic summit starting Friday in Paris, and ``we'll see where wecome out.''   Shouts of ``Welcome President Bush!'' rang out and hand-heldAmerican flags fluttered in the air as the president arrived at themonument to Polish workers killed in an uprising in 1970 during thebirth of the labor movement. Thousands lined the route of hismotorcade, then massed at the monument to hear Bush's pledge tostand with Poland.   Bush stressed that hard work and sacrifice are still ahead forPoles as they try to rebuild their economy.   But his main message was one of help and hope that their 40-yearstruggle _ first against the Nazis, then against Communistsuppression _ will realize the ``ancient dream'' of freedom. And hedid so by referring to President Kennedy's dramatic speech at theBerlin Wall 26 years ago.   In grimmer times, Kennedy had stood outside the barrier betweenEast and West and said that if anyone thought Communism was the waveof the future, ``Let them come to Berlin.''   Bush put it this way:   ``Today to those who think that hopes can be forever suppressed,I say let them look at Poland. To those who think that freedom canbe forever denied, I say, let them look at Poland. And to those whothink that dreams can be forever repressed, I say let them look atPoland _ for here, in Poland, the dream is alive.   ``It is here in Poland where we can work to end the division ofEurope. It is in your power to help end the division of Europe,''Bush said. ``The people of Poland can show the world what a freepeople with commitment and energy can accomplish.''   Walesa and the crowd seemed reluctant to let the president go.   Bush urged Poles to stay in their country and help withrebuilding, rather then emigrate as so many thousands have done overthe years. ``Stay with us. Stay with us,'' they asked him.   Standing in Walesa's backyard after lunch, Bush said, ``I clearlysalute'' his accomplishments toward democratic reforms and ``want towork with him and Poland'' to achieve economic reforms.   Walesa, who wore a silver Solidarity pin on his black tie, toldreporters, ``We're not after any loans. We're after cooperation.''   He said that if Western banks could open branches in Poland with$10 billion and ``could strike a good deal in Poland, that would fixour economic problem.''   ``This is what I asked Mr. President about. That was my primaryappeal and request,'' Walesa said.   Earlier Walesa said in an ABC-TV interview that Bush's $115million aid proposals ``don't really help.'' The Solidarity leadersaid: ``It's just a sort of a drop in the bucket. We need shocktreatment.''   The crowd at the Solidarity monument, which included miners inblack uniforms with tall, feather-topped black hats, chanted ``LechWalesa! Lech Walesa!'' and ``Solidarity! Solidarity!''   Crowned by three crosses topped with anchors, the Solidaritymonument commemorates the first three shipyard workers killed bygovernment security forces during 1970 strikes over food prices inwhich hundreds are believed to have died. Officially, the death tollwas 45.   Earlier, during a brief visit to the 14th century Oliva Cathedralin suburban Gdansk, Bush was greeted by several thousand flag-wavingPoles who sang ``May You Live 100 Years'' and tossed red and whiteroses and carnations at his motorcade.   When he left the cathedral for the ride to Walesa's home, thepresident stood on his limousine's running board and waved to crowdschanting ``Solidarity! Solidarity!''</TEXT></DOC>
