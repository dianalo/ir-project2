During the seventh day of discussions on Friday, the Sandinistagovernment remained adamant in its insistence on a full withdrawalof Contra forces from Nicaragua to base camps in Honduras.   For its part, the Nicaraguan resistance stood firm in refusingto consider even a partial withdrawal of the estimated 5,000Contras deployed in Nicaragua.   United Nations and Organization of American States mediatorswere spending the weekend drafting a revised working document forpresentation to the negotiators when they resume their discussionshere on Monday at the OAS.   President Daniel Ortega suspended the cease-fire on Nov. 1,citing what he described as Contra terrorist activities. He hassaid the Feb. 25 national elections will go ahead as planned evenif no truce agreement is reached.   After a two-hour negotiating session Friday, Sandinista ViceForeign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco warned that a cease-fire inplace, as proposed by the Contras, would create in Nicaragua asituation similar to that in El Salvador where truces have nevertaken hold.   ``We consider that an effective cease-fire in Nicaragua means aseparation of forces, and a separation of forces means all theContras to withdraw with their arms to their camps in Honduras,''Tinoco said. ``Otherwise, there will be no cease-fire.''   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros said such a retreat would leavethe rebels at a disadvantage.   ``Once our forces have withdrawn from certain areas, thegovernment forces have taken advantage to move there in force,deploy huge amounts of weapons, huge amounts of forces, to repressour civilian supporters,'' he said.   After two days of talks at the United Nations and five morehere, Matamoros said there are ``substantial differences'' butnoted that both sides are willing to continue the negotiations.   Tinoco also ruled out the possibility of reaching a compromiseby allowing the Contras to redeploy in designated enclaves insideNicaragua, subject to international inspection.   He said the Nicaraguan terrain doesn't lend itself to such asolution because much of the country is heavily wooded and therebels would have the ability to move in and out of the enclavesundetected.   The enclave concept, he said, ``has never functioned in humanhistory.''   OAS mediator Hugo De Zela of Peru resorted to understatement incharacterizing the status of the talks.   He said there are ``some discrepancies'' between the two sides.But, he added, ``the fact that we are continuing signifiesprogress.''</TEXT></DOC>
