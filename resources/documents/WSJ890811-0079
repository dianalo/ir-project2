The settlement, if approved by U.S. District Judge A. Joe Fish of Dallas, would rank among the five largest malpractice settlements ever paid by a law firm in the U.S., according to malpractice insurers.    The payment also would rank as the second largest obtained by the FSLIC in its prosecution of malpractice claims against law firms that advised savings associations. A year ago, the Philadelphia law firm of Blank, Rome, Comisky andamp; McCauley agreed to pay the FSLIC $40 million to settle claims from the law firm's involvement with Sunrise Savings andamp; Loan Association of Boynton Beach, Fla. That settlement was rejected by the federal judge handling the case but has been resubmitted and is awaiting the judge's written approval.    The FSLIC initially sought $100 million from Jenkens andamp; Gilchrist in a lawsuit filed in June 1987 over the firm's advice to the now-defunct State Savings andamp; Loan Association of Lubbock, Texas, and Brownfield Savings andamp; Loan Association of Brownfield, Texas.    The cost of defending that lawsuit -- more than $5 million -- prompted Jenkens andamp; Gilchrist's lead malpractice insurer, Texas Lawyers Insurance Exchange, to file a separate suit to withdraw its coverage. A state district judge ruled last month, however, that the policy didn't permit the coverage to be withdrawn.    Jenkens andamp; Gilchrist, with 183 lawyers, is settling the FSLIC suit involving the two Sandamp;Ls for $10 million, all but $150,000 of which will be covered by the firm's policy with Texas Lawyers Insurance Exchange. Gregory, Self andamp; Beutenmuller, a small firm that spun off from Jenkens andamp; Gilchrist, is separately paying the FSLIC $5 million to settle. Four former partners from Jenkens andamp; Gilchrist aren't settling, according to a letter to Judge Fish from Jenkens andamp; Gilchrist's defense attorney, Lyman G. Hughes.    A separate agreement with the FSLIC calls for Jenkens andamp; Gilchrist's insurers to pay $10 million to settle claims not yet filed involving the firm's work for Vernon Savings andamp; Loan Association, a Dallas thrift whose lending practices have led to federal criminal charges against seven former officers and borrowers.    Thomas Cantrill, a Jenkens andamp; Gilchrist managing partner, wouldn't comment on the terms of the settlement, except to say, &quot;We are working with the FSLIC in an effort to resolve our differences.&quot; Lawyers with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in Washington, representing the FSLIC, also declined to comment on the terms of the settlement. </TEXT></DOC>
