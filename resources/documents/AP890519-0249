(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Miniature porcelain critters decorating anoffice window are the only evidence of animals at Avon ProductsInc.'s test laboratory.   The cosmetics maker has closed the facility at its research andmanufacturing center in Suffern, N.Y. where until early last summerit squirted beauty potions on rabbits and mice to determine if theconcoctions were safe. Besides disbanding its animal-testingoperation, Avon says it hasn't asked independent laboratories totest on animals since mid-March and Chairman James E. Preston hasdeclared the company will discontinue testing permanently.   It might sound like Avon should win plaudits from animal welfareactivists, but it's about to get a booby prize.   On June 2, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals plans tobestow a ``Pinocchio Award'' on the Avon chairman, contending Avonhas lied about its commitment to stopping the use of animals inproduct safety tests and has failed to honestly describe pastprocedures.   Avon, recently involved in a nasty tussle repelling unsolicitedtakeover advances from Amway Corp., has been receiving lots ofunwanted attention from PETA's operatives. They've picketedPreston's Connecticut home and are urging an international boycottof Avon products.   The Pinocchio award, a 10-foot replica of a nose, is bound togenerate some additional unwelcome publicity.   The problems confronting Avon are similar to those facing manycompanies that have relied on animals for decades to test productsranging from eye shadow to candy bars.   But Avon and other cosmetics makers have been targeted by theanti-animal-testing movement to heighten publicity, even thoughthey account for only a tiny portion of the animals subjected tolab experiments.   Henry Spira, a long-time animal rights activist and head of aNew York-based coalition that once campaigned against Revlon Inc.,says pointing a finger at beauty peddlers that use eye-blindingtests on rabbits is an ``optimal'' strategy.   ``The juxtaposition of the dream of beauty and the nightmare ofthe rabbits'' is a perfect protest theme, says Spira.   Moreover, there is a strong perception that testing cosmetics isa frivolous reason for maiming or killing animals. Lipstick andmascara aren't among life's necessities.   This perception helps evoke more sympathy than if protesterstargeted animal testing in the development of life-saving drugs ormedical treatments.   Spira doesn't condone PETA's tactics against Avon and applaudscompanies for taking steps toward recognizing animal rights. ``Itdoesn't make any sense to me to dump on a company that'sresponsive,'' says Spira.   Susan Rich, coordinator of PETA's campaign, doesn't deny thatAvon and other companies have moved away from testing.   ``We certainly acknowledge the progress that they have made,''she says, citing the decline in the number of animals used byindustries. Avon, for example, says 2,423 animals were used in1988, down from 4,063 in 1987 and 14,500 in 1981.   But she says only constant reminders will keep Avon and othercompanies accountable. ``We've not asked these companies to stopanimal testing overnight. But we want them to commit themselves totimetables.''   The decision was made to intensify pressure on Avon partlybecause, in PETA's view, the company sent confusing signals aboutits position.   Avon chief Preston, in a recent interview, attempted to clarifywhere his company stands.   ``We are not going to authorize, condone or request anytesting,'' he says. However, Avon opposes prohibiting such testsand has lobbied against legislative bans proposed in several states.   Part of the reason for this stance may be the rapidbreakthroughs in skin care treatments and beauty formulas.Suppliers, anxious to market these products, may want to checktheir safety quickly. Until non-animal test methods are readilyavailable, inventors may have no choice but to test on animals.   Moreover, Preston says some important overseas markets for U.S.cosmetics require animal tests. Avon doesn't intend to askforeigners to change their laws.   There is no U.S. law that requires cosmetic testing on animals.But the Food and Drug Administration says it will expect companiesto conduct such tests until alternatives are accepted.   ``The FDA position is that the use of animal tests by industryto establish the safety of regulated products is necessary tominimize the risks from such products to humans,'' the agency saidin a recent policy letter.   Given these circumstances, Preston says: ``Our position is thesafety of consumers and the international competitiveness of theAmerican cosmetics industry comes first.''   For now, Avon and a few U.S. competitors say they are willing todelay introduction of new products until safety can be determinedthrough non-animal tests.   In suspending animal tests last week, Mary Kay Cosmetics becamethe latest beauty-products firm to say it may have to delay releaseof some items.   The drive toward alternatives accelerated in January when NoxellCorp., maker of Noxzema skin creams and Cover Girl cosmetics, saidit was screening many cosmetics by applying them to tissue culturesin lab dishes instead of squirting them into rabbits' eyes.   Avon also has replaced this procedure, the so-called Draize eyeirritation test.   The test, named after a former FDA official, has been widelyused for nearly 50 years. The solution to be tested is injectedinto the eyes of rabbits, usually an albino breed because theabsence of natural coloring allows easier observation. Rabbits wereselected because they lack tear ducts that would help wash away thesolution.   A growing number of companies in the cosmetics, chemical andpharmaceutical industries are attempting to validate new non-animaltesting methods.   At labs nationwide, experiments are done with bacteria, cellcultures, living tissue in test tubes and computer simulations.   Some labs, like the Johns Hopkins Center for Alternatives toAnimal Testing, were established with financing from companies inindustries in which animal testing has been standard procedure.   In the end, companies may find that non-animal replacements arefar less expensive and much more accurate than animal testsdeveloped decades ago. National Testing Corp. of Palm Springs,Calif., for example, says its Eytex method adopted by Avon issignificantly cheaper than the Draize test.   Says activist Spira: ``Even if there were no animal movement,the movement for alternatives would continue on its own.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Monday, May 22</NOTE></DOC>
