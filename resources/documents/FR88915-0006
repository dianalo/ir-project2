Gilbertson, Centerfor Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD-210), Food and Drug Administration,5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301-295-8000.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This document amends four final OTCdrug monographs in (1) 21 CFR Part 336 for OTC antiemetic drug products(as set forth in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of April 30, 1987; 52 FR 15886); (2) 21 CFR Part341 for OTC antitussive drug products (as set forth in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of August 12, 1987; 52 FR 30042); (3) 21 CFRPart 341 for OTC bronchodilator drug products; and (4) 21 CFR Part 357,Subpart B for OTC anthelmintic drug products. The amendments revise thewording of the age ranges for children's dosages currently contained inthe final monographs, as necessary, to clarify and indicate uniformly thatthe adult dosages are also for children 12 years of age and over; thatthe dosages for children 6 years of age and older and for children 6 to12 years of age are for children 6 years of age to under 12 years of age;and that the dosages for children 2 to 6 years are for children 2 yearsof age to under 6 years of age. These amendments do not change the actualage ranges specified in the final monographs. These changes in the current wording of the age ranges for children's dosagesare not related to the notice of intent on pediatric dosing informationfor OTC human drugs published by the agency in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of June 20, 1988 (53 FR 23180). Any regulatorychanges that may result from that notice of intent will be incorporatedin the four final OTC drug monographs identified above, in a future issueof the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Because these labeling revisions represent minor clarifying changes thatdo not change the substance of the labeling requirements contained in thefinal monographs and because OTC drug products on the market may currentlybe in compliance with the labeling designated in the above-mentioned finalmonographs, the agency has determined that these labeling revisions donot need to be implemented on the effective date of this final rule, butmay be implemented by manufacturers at their next printing of labels foraffected products. The agency has examined the economic consequences of this final rule inconjunction with other rules resulting from the OTC drug review. In a noticepublished in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5806), the agencyannounced the availability of an assessment of these economic impacts.The assessment determined that the combined impacts of all the rules resultingfrom the OTC drug review do not constitute a major rule according to thecriteria established by Executive Order 12291. The agency therefore concludesthat no one of these rules, including this final rule amending the finalOTC monographs for antiemetic, antitussive, bronchodilator, and anthelminticdrug products, is a major rule. The economic assessment also concluded that the overall OTC drug reviewwas not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L.96-354. That assessment included a discretionary Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis in the event that an individual rule might impose an unusual ordisproportionate impact on small entities. However, this particular rulemakingamending the final OTC monographs for antiemetic, antitussive, bronchodilator,and anthelmintic drug products is not expected to pose such an impact onsmall businesses. Therefore, the agency certifies that this final rulewill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action isof a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significanteffect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact statement is required.As noted above, these amendments institute changes that are of a nonsubstantivenature. Because the amendments are not controversial and because, wheneffective, they provide clarification of final OTC drug monographs, FDAfinds that the usual notice and comment procedures are unnecessary. Theamendments, therefore, shall become effective October 17, 1988. However,interested persons may, on or before October 17, 1988, submit written commentson these amendments to the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Threecopies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals maysubmit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number foundin brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seenin the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday throughFriday.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>21 CFR <T3>Part 336</T3>Labeling, Over-the-counter drugs, Antiemetic drug products.21 CFR <T3>Part 341</T3>Labeling, Over-the-counter drugs, Antitussive drug products, Bronchodilatordrug products.21 CFR <T3>Part 357</T3>Labeling, Over-the-counter drugs, Anthelmintic drug products.Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the AdministrativeProcedure Act, Subchapter D of Chapter I of Title 21 of the Code of FederalRegulations is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 336_ANTIEMETIC DRUG PRODUCTS FOR OVER-THE-COUNTER HUMAN USE</ITAG>1.
