Also today, the Communist government canceled a planned visit bya delegation from the left-leaning West German opposition party, theSocial Democrats.   The number of refugees reaching West Germany neared 14,000 today,and Budapest vowed to keep its borders open for East Germans headingWest.   Several times in the past few days, West German Chancellor HelmutKohl has urged the East German leadership to make political andeconomic improvements to curb the number of refugees. The SocialDemocrats have also called for reforms.   But Guenter Mittag, the Central Committee member in charge of theEast German economy, rejected those calls in a commentary today inthe Communist Party daily newspaper Neues Deutschland.   ``The reform proposals of those people contain only one point:they want the type of reform that does away with Socialism,'' Mittagwrote. ``Thanks a lot for that. It just won't be that way!''   Mittag also accused West Germany of causing the exodus with``promises, enticements and also with psychological pressure.'' Hecalled on those left behind to do everything possible to strengthenthe nation of 16.6 million people.   Neues Deutschland expressed its ``thanks and joy'' for Thursday'sannouncement that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will visitEast Berlin for the nation's 40th anniversary celebrations on Oct. 7.   East German leader Erich Honecker has vigorously rejected callsfor the kind of reforms Gorbachev advocates for the Soviet Bloc.   Soviet Politburo member Yegor Ligachev said in Berlin that Moscowis East Germany's ``loyal friend'' and accused West Germanpoliticians and news media of mounting a ``tendentious campaign''against East Germany.   Most of the current wave of East German refugees are young peoplewho have turned their back on the political repression and economicdifficulties in their home country. Many are skilled workers leavingbehind a huge hole in their nation's work force.   Harry Tisch, a Central Committee member who heads the state-runlabor union in East Germany, acknowledged that the government wouldhave to find solutions to ``bridge this gap.''   ``It certainly won't be easy,'' Tisch said during a visit toStuttgart. ``Naturally, it's not unproblematical for us that youngskilled workers from the German Democratic Republic are resettlingin the Federal Republic of Germany.''   According to statistics released Thursday by the West Germangovernment, East Germany is suffering its biggest talent drain fromthe nation's work force since the Berlin Wall went up in 1961.   The ministry report said 55 percent of the refugees who have cometo West Germany since August are between 18 and 30 years of age. Itsaid 86 percent had successfully completed high levels of jobtraining.   The figures, compiled from information provided by the newcomersduring registration after arrival, indicate that 33 percent had beenemployed in heavy industry and 25 percent in the service sector,where shortages already had been reported. According to the report,most had occupied middle-level positions.   The East German leadership has been hampered by Honecker'sprotracted recovery from gallbladder surgery last month, leading oneCommunist Party official to call the country a ``ship without acaptain.'' But Tisch told the news conference today that Honeckerwas ``on the way to recovery.''   In East Berlin, Parliament President Horst Sindermann announcedthat the Communist government had canceled the opposition SocialDemocrats' visit that had been scheduled for next week.   Sindermann accused the party, which routinely strives for betterties to East Germany, of planning a ``confrontation'' with theCommunist government.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats hadalready bitterly criticized plans for the trip, saying the SocialDemocrats should avoid the appearance of showing support for theCommunist government's rigid stance.</TEXT></DOC>
