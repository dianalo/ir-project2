At an Aug. 16 meeting, the committee voted to leave monetary policy unchanged for the moment, but to lean toward tighter policy should more signs of higher inflation or robust economic growth emerge. The Fed increased the discount rate, the rate it charges on loans to financial institutions, to 6.5% from 6% on Aug. 8.    The minutes of the Aug. 16 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee were released Friday after the customary period of about six weeks. The committee, which includes all seven Fed governors and the presidents of five regional Fed banks, met again last week.    According to the minutes, the committee was nearly unanimous in deciding against any immediate policy moves, but was split on future direction.    &quot;Many thought that some further firming was likely to be needed, perhaps relatively soon,&quot; the minutes show. &quot;These members saw substantial risks that inflationary pressures would intensify.&quot; One member of this camp -- Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland -- dissented from the Aug. 16 vote. He argued that inflation already was too high and favored tighter policy.    Other members, while willing to lean more toward a tighter than easier monetary policy, &quot;were less certain of the potential need for further monetary restraint, especially in the near term,&quot; the minutes say. &quot;These members emphasized that . . . the tightening actions over the past several months represented . . . a major policy move whose restraining impact wasn't yet fully reflected in the economy.&quot; They feared that the Fed might tighten too much, hurting vulnerable financial institutions, consumer and business borrowers and debtor nations.    The Fed has nudged short-term interest rates up about 1 1/2 points since the end of March in an attempt to retard the growth of the economy and head off an acceleration of inflation. Since the middle of August, there have been some signs that the economy has begun to cool off. Short-term interest rates have been stable and long-term rates have dropped a bit. Some members of the open market committee seem to be prepared to declare victory and let interest rates remain stable for a while, but others are still convinced of the need for tighter policy to prevent an inflationary outburst.    The minutes also show that &quot;a number of members&quot; of the committee argued that the Fed ought to pay closer attention to the growth of the money supply as a guide to making policy, &quot;although only a few favored giving primary emphasis to these measures.&quot; But &quot;several members&quot; opposed such a strategy, saying they weren't convinced that the money supply is a reliable guide. They prefer to watch statistics that track the economy directly, such as measures of factory output and consumer and producer prices.    The open market committee agreed to set the target range for the federal funds rate between 6% and 10%, up from the earlier 5%-9% range. The federal funds rate, the interest rate that the Fed influences most directly, is the rate at which banks lend to each other. </TEXT></DOC>
