If any problems arise, they say,Israel is credit-worthy and will, as always, take care of itsobligations.   But a review of U.S. aid to Israel over the years revealsa more complicated picture involving special deals that windup costing taxpayers more than advertised in the beginning.</LP><TEXT>   Consider the $1.2 billion in economic aid that the U.S.transfers to Israel each year. Unlike most foreign subsidies,which are paid in quarterly installments, this one isremitted in a lump sum at the beginning of the U.S. fiscalyear. That means the U.S. has to borrow the funds againstfuture revenues, and therefore pays interest on theborrowings -- at U.S. taxpayer expense.   And what does Israel do with its expedited subsidy? Itlends the money back to the U.S., purchasing Treasury billsthat in one recent year earned Israel $76.7 million ininterest payments from Uncle Sam.   A similar gimmick last year accomplished the politicallysensitive purpose of increasing Israel's military subsidy.Congress directed that the U.S. disburse the military aidright away. That money, too, was invested in U.S. governmentsecurities, where it has been drawn down as needed. The netresult is that Israel will earn more than $34 million thisyear in interest on the grant, according to a senior Israeliofficial.   As one congressional aide puts it, there's a&quot;truth-in-labeling&quot; problem: &quot;The nature of the aid effort issometimes more than we realize.&quot;   But as the Bush administration squares off againstIsrael's plea for $10 billion in immediate loan guarantees,some officials are trying to find out precisely how muchmoney Israel's special carve-outs cost. Rep. Lee Hamilton(D., Ind.), though a supporter of Israeli aid programs, saysthat in recent years, his House Foreign Affairs subcommitteehas identified Israel as one of three whose aid&quot;substantially exceeds the popularly quoted figures.&quot;   In Israel's case, he says, the publicly quoted figure is$3 billion. But the State Department has provided him withfigures indicating that Israel's aid in 1991 actually exceeds$4.3 billion -- not including $400 million in housing loanguarantees provided earlier this year. Egypt and Turkey alsoreceive funds in excess of the widely cited figures, he says.   &quot;It is important we understand . . . the total amount ofU.S. assistance, rather than cloak it as we have done byputting it under so many spigots,&quot; Rep. Hamilton says.   Israeli officials say it is unfair to look at theU.S.-Israeli financial relationship as one in which onlyIsrael benefits. Officials described it as a partnership inwhich the U.S. gains strategically from Israeli intelligenceand technical know-how. Israel, they add, is the U.S.'s mostloyal Middle East ally. An official describes the aid programas a bargain for the U.S. and says the cost to the U.S. toprotect its interests in the Middle East would be much higherif Israel didn't exist.   And unlike Egypt, Israeli officials say, Israel hasn'tasked the U.S. to forgive its military debts. Indeed, theypoint out, Israel spends about $1.2 billion a year repayingborrowings from the U.S. government and commercial banks.   That is true -- as far as it goes. Congress gave Israel asure-fire way of repaying its debt in the mid-1980s, whenIsrael was in deep economic trouble. Lawmakers directed thatthe U.S. provide Israel with economic assistance equaling orexceeding its annual debt repayment to the U.S.   The bottom line: Israel is using most of its $1.2 billioneconomic grant this year to repay debt that grew from U.S.military loans, according to figures Israel supplied to theU.S. this month.   In fact, military loans have a way of becoming grants.From 1974 to 1989, Israel received a total of $16.4 billionin &quot;loans&quot; that the U.S. converted to &quot;grants,&quot; according tocongressional researchers. The money went out in the firstplace with the understanding that it wouldn't be repaid; itwas categorized as loans because loans don't requireoversight by U.S. officials, while grants do, the researcherssay.   The financial-aid pot is sweetened in other ways. A fewyears ago, the U.S. allowed Israel and some other countriesto refinance portions of their military debt with banks thatprovided lower interest rates. This arrangement saves Israelabout $150 million a year in interest payments -- money thatwould have otherwise gone to the U.S., according to StateDepartment figures. The U.S. agreed to guarantee repayment on90% of the bank loans.   Israel's request for the $10 billion loan guarantees hasheightened concern in some quarters about its economicstability. Rep. David Obey (D., Wis.), for one, supports therequest, but wants a delay so Congress can answer a few keyquestions. &quot;Does Israel have the financial capacity to paythese loans back without -- and I underline without --additional U.S. assistance?&quot; he asks. Israel says it does,but Rep. Obey says his appropriations subcommittee will holda hearing in two weeks.   &quot;Anytime you are asked to put your name on a $10 billionloan guarantee, you have an obligation to know doggone wellthat it is wired together well enough so you don't wind upholding any liabilities,&quot; Rep. Obey says.   But Israel's strongest supporters don't want a delay. Theyargue that the program would also provide jobs and exportsfor Americans, and that Israel always pays its debts. Israel&quot;has never even been late with loan payments {and} it hasgood credit ratings among international commercial lenders,&quot;Sen. Harris Wofford (D., Pa.) said last week. &quot;Our guaranteewill enable Israel to borrow money from American banks atmore favorable rates.&quot;   Either way, there's little doubt that Israel reliesheavily upon foreign aid and borrowing to maintain itseconomy, according to congressional researchers. Since 1976,they say, Israel has been the largest annual recipient ofU.S. foreign assistance; between 1949 and the present, theU.S. has provided Israel with $53 billion in grants andloans.   With the massive immigration of Soviet Jews and others,Israeli officials say that more U.S. help is critical.Between 1990 and 1996, they expect one million people to haveimmigrated to Israel. Right now, they say, Israel's&quot;absorption efforts&quot; -- the cost of resettling refugees --represent 16.1%, or $5.3 billion, of its $33 billion budget.By 1992, they say, the resettlements will take nearly 19% ofIsrael's budget.   These officials make no excuses for wringing every dollaror special favor from Congress. Israel forever is findingcreative ways to stretch its U.S. aid, find new dollars, orpump up its ailing economy.   The U.S. even helps bankroll Israel's own foreign-aidprogram, providing a $7.5 million grant that Israel, in turn,uses to finance development projects in Third World countriesand for the training of foreigners.   Although military aid has traditionally been used partlyto help spur purchases of U.S. goods, Israel is authorized tospend an increasing amount of its $1.8 billion annualmilitary grant on procurements within its own borders.Congress designated $475 million for this purpose in thecurrent year. This not only creates domestic spending andjobs for Israel, it generates hard currency, according tocongressional researchers.   Israel's basic source of U.S. aid amounts to $3 billion --the $1.8 billion military grant plus the $1.2 billioneconomic grant. But U.S. figures demonstrate that with thevarious programs benefiting Israel, the aid level easilyexceeds $3 billion. Some officials, such as Rep. Obey, thinkthat when the value of all cash, equipment and programs isadded together, the amount is closer to $5 billion. Israelsays that isn't so, but acknowledges that its assistance thisyear was nearly $4 billion.   One reason: This year Israel also received $650 million insupplemental economic aid for the damages and costs itincurred during the Persian Gulf War. A report prepared byRep. Hamilton's Foreign Affairs subcommittee shows thatCongress also provided $45 million to help resettle SovietJews and $7 million for Israeli-Arab cooperative programs. Itset aside $42 million for development of the Arrowanti-tactical ballistic missile defense system.   The U.S. also earmarked $100 million toward expanding ajoint U.S.-Israeli military stockpile. In addition, Israel iseligible to receive as much as $700 million in surplus U.S.defense equipment.   Despite the size of the aid program, there is littleoversight by the U.S. In the case of the $1.2 billioneconomic-support program, the grant agreement allows the U.S.to review Israel's documentation on how it spends the money.But U.S. officials don't exercise that option, relyinginstead on quarterly disbursement reports from Israel.   The latest report consisted of a one-page letter.</TEXT></DOC>
