ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic Party regulars on Wednesdaydescribed incoming party chairman Ronald H. Brown as ``his ownman,'' but there was widespread concern that his ties to JesseJackson and Edward M. Kennedy would reinforce the party's liberalimage.   ``I don't see him as Jackson's man,'' said Sam Shipley, chairmanof the Delaware Democratic Party. ``I see him as his own man. Ithink most (people) see him as Jackson's man, but not the partyleaders.''   An Associated Press survey of state Democratic Party leaders andelected officials disclosed a wide range of opinion about the impactBrown's election might have on party fortunes.   They spoke as the chairman-to-be prepared to head into the Southon Thursday on a trip designed to confront concerns of party leadersin a region marked by the conservative cast of its politics.   Now unopposed for the party leadership post, Brown will becomechairman at the Democratic National Committee meeting in Washingtonon Feb. 10 _ the first black to head a major political party. Heemerged the victor in a five-way contest that included three formerHouse members and the chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party.   Brown joined Jackson's presidential campaign in May 1988 and ashis convention manager was Jackson's principal negotiator with aidesto Michael Dukakis.   Brown also played a major role in Kennedy's 1980 presidentialcampaign and was general counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committeewhen Kennedy was chairman.   While many party officials said they were confident of Brown'sindependence, doubts remained among conservative Democrats. Theirconcerns were based not on Brown's views on issues but on his tiesto party liberals.   ``He is Jackson's man,'' said John Henry Anderson, the GeorgiaDemocratic Party chairman. But he expressed desire to work withBrown.   ``Nothing is as bad tomorrow as it looks today,'' he said.   Louisiana Sen. John Breaux, chairman of the Democratic SenateCampaign Committee, was one of the last holdouts for an alternativeto Brown.   But Breaux said Brown's role as convention chairman for theJackson presidential campaign should not be held against him.   ``There were a lot of moderates and whites who urged him to takethat job at the convention and be a moderator,'' Breaux said. ``NowI think the same people should be willing to give him a chance.''   He urged Brown to appoint a task force to address the concerns ofmoderates.   Some legislative leaders voiced concern that Brown's selectioncould hurt Democrats in local races _ a possibility most respondentsthought unlikely.   ``I don't know Ron Brown,'' said R. Clayton Mitchell, speaker ofthe Maryland House of Delegates. ``I don't know anything about RonBrown. But people I've talked to are concerned it might hurt us.''Mitchell said there was a conservative trend in the country and ``alot of people are concerned we're moving away from the nationaltrend.''   Martin Tandler, a New York businessman active in raising moneyfor Democratic Senate and House candidates, said Brown's election``may be a problem in that on a national level the Democratic Partyhas managed to either paint itself or be painted into a corner thatrepresents the interests of minorities and women and disenfranchisedto the exclusion of the middle class.''   ``It's a very positive step for us to pick a black chairman,''said John Marino, executive director of the New York DemocraticParty. ``That's because we don't look at Ron Brown as simply beingblack. We look upon him as someone who can unite all Democrats andput it together.''   Some of the strongest early opposition to Brown came from AlabamaDemocratic chairman John Baker, who said he would considerboycotting national party functions if Brown became chairman. Hesaid a Brown chairmanship would be a victory for the ``ultra-liberalwing'' of the party.   Joe Reed, a black Alabama Democratic official, countered that``with that kind of talk (by Baker), Lee Atwater (the Republicannational chairman) would not have a hard job getting blacks to jointhe Republican Party.''   Mac Parsons, an Alabama state senator with strong ties toorganized labor, said Brown's election furthers the image of theDemocrats as the party of blacks and liberals.   ``Unfortunately, in politics, once the image is created, it'sawfully difficult to change, even if the image is incorrect,'' hesaid.   Peter Kelly, a Connecticut party leader, said Brown might have totake a step comparable to Richard Nixon's move to normalizerelations with China, a step made easier by Nixon's long history asa fervent anti-communist.   ``Ron Brown comes from the liberal wing of the party and will, asthe saying goes, have to go to China like Nixon did,'' Kelly said.``The ball's in his court.''   Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado met with Brown last weekend and saidhe told Brown ``the party's goals need to be redefined. I meant thatthe Democrats have to help to make a free market work and be frugalin spending.''   Romer said that while there was a perception that Brown is tiedto Jackson ``it will be corrected shortly.''</TEXT></DOC>
