HONG</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   North Korea launched a campaign Friday to promotesocialism, warning that it could be destroyed by political reformand a multiparty system.   Radio Press, a private Japanese news agency that monitorsCommunist news reports, said the campaign suggests that North Koreais watching the recent reforms in East Europe with ``a strong senseof crisis.''   ``If political pluralism and the multiparty system were allowedin socialist society, they would bring grave consequences.Anti-socialist forces may come to the fore and destroy thepolitical unity of the popular masses and fundamentally demolishthe socialist system,'' ruling Communist officials of North Koreasaid.   Official Radio Pyongyang broadcast news of the campaign in a50-minute report from the Communists' Workers Party organ, RodongSinmun. The Korean Central News Agency carried a full text of theRodong Sinmun article as well as eight other related stories.   North Korean media have remained silent on the dramatic changesin Eastern Europe, and the reports Friday did not mention them.   However, an article carried by the Korean Central News Agency'sEnglish service said socialism ``is facing a grave challenge.''   The article asserted that the socialist system was bound to winout. ``Socialism tomorrow which withstood challenge of theimperialists today is sure to be crowned with the honor of finalvictory,'' it said.   North Korea, one of the most isolated countries in the world,has been making a timid attempt to emulate the policies of opennessand economic reform undertaken by China and the Soviet Union.   However, the hard-line state remains firmly under the grip ofPresident Kim Il Sung, who has been ruling it since 1945. Neitherhe nor his heir-designate son, Kim Jong Il, has shown signs of adesire for major reform.   The party article said, ``The capitalists not only oppose thesocialist, communist idea _ a great ideology which indicates thepath of a worthy life of man _ but also spread reactionarybourgeois ideology and culture ....   The article went on to say: ``If there is a crisis in socialistcountries, it is not a crisis resulting from `lack' of commodities,but a crisis resulting from lack of communist ideology.''   ``The only effective prescription to cure the fatal disease ofthe capitalist society and achieve world peace and commonprosperity of mankind is to liquidate the capitalist exploitingsystem and advance toward socialism,'' it said.</TEXT></DOC>
