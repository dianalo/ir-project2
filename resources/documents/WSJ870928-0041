George Deukmejian is expected to sign a bill this week that would exempt the tobacco industry from most product-liability suits in that state, continuing a national wave of court and legislative actions that has sharply narrowed the industry's exposure.    The California bill is particularly significant because its provisions are retroactive. That may result in the dismissal of some 30 pending suits against tobacco companies -- nearly a quarter of all those pending in the country.    Noting California's often trend-setting status, tobacco industry analysts predicted the legislative momentum may carry over to other states, which could effectively stunt the latest round of suits seeking damages from tobacco companies.    But some specialists in the tobacco litigation think the measure, approved by legislators amid a flurry of session-ending bills, is more a product of California politics than an indication of how other states will act. Noting several important pending cases in other states, Donald Garner, a law professor at Southern Illinois University, said, &quot;This is a decade-long battle; these cases have a ways to go.&quot;    Lawyers said the bill provides the strongest shield in the nation against product-liability suits. Under the measure, a manufacturer or seller would be immune from such suits if the product that caused injury is inherently unsafe, is known to be unsafe by the &quot;ordinary consumer&quot; and is a common consumer product intended for personal consumption -- such as, the bill states, tobacco, sugar, alcohol, butter and castor oil. </TEXT></DOC>
