The indictment charges that Brad Wilkus, the exchange's former director of telecommunications, set up his own corporation and acted as middleman in a $635,000 transaction that he arranged between a telephone-equipment supplier and the exchange. He allegedly told the exchange that equipment would have to be bought through a local distributor, which turned out to be him. The fraud was alleged to have occurred between March 1983 and December 1984, as the exchange was purchasing telephone equipment for its new building.    The Merc, which in 1985 sued Mr. Wilkus in federal court here, has said that no other exchange employees were involved in or knew about the alleged scheme.    Yesterday, a Merc spokeswoman wasn't certain whether the exchange's suit against Mr. Wilkus is still pending. Other exchange officials and Mr. Wilkus couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
