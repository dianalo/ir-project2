The nuclearwinter hypothesis, the basis of which was first proposed in 1982, directedscientific research into the consequences of massive amounts of dustand smoke, from nuclear detonations, on the earth's climate and subsequentlyon the ecology of the earth. This thesis presents the evolution of thenuclear winter hypothesis in order to elucidate its unique aspects forglobal devastation and the consensus of plausibility which the hypothesisholds in the scientific community. The hypothesis has aroused a flurryof debate on its implications for nuclear policy. With the historicalaspects of the nuclear era as a backdrop, the question of incorporatingnew scientific information on the consequences of nuclear war into policyis discussed. The observed responses of the U.S. and Soviet Union andthe implications for future actions in response to the nuclear winterhypothesis are examined-- leading to the conclusion that the hypothesiswill have little or no impact on U.S. and Soviet nuclear policy.</TEXT></DOC>
