In the short term, OPEC's biggest problem is to maintain the discipline of its members to restrain oil output. Although the cartel has been surprisingly successful this year in defending its benchmark price of $18 a barrel, it must limit production for at least the rest of this decade to avoid another price collapse, most experts say.    &quot;OPEC basically has a major management job for the next 2 1/2 years,&quot; says Lawrence Goldstein, executive vice president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.    This summer, demand for OPEC oil has surged, and most of the exporters have been eager to oblige. OPEC production is currently estimated at 19 million barrels a day -- well above the 16.6 million ceiling set by the cartel for the 1987 second half.    The larger-than-planned production shows that some OPEC members are putting national goals ahead of cartel policies. For example, Iraq, locked in a seven-year war with Iran, refuses to accept an output quota, and OPEC members supporting Iraq in the war look the other way. Several other members are anxious to produce heavily to make up revenues lost in last year's oil-price collapse.    So, although most members insist that they will abide by quotas when averaged over a three-month period, Kuwait and others now producing heavily aren't likely to cut back sharply next month just to stay within their third-quarter limits.    In fact, some oil economists believe that OPEC has already overproduced despite its discipline in curbing output earlier this year. They expect renewed volatility in oil markets, and perhaps even renewed price declines before year end, barring a halt in tanker traffic, which would drive up prices.    So far, however, the effects of OPEC overproduction have been mitigated by other factors. After the recent run-up beyond $22 a barrel, oil prices on spot and futures markets have dropped back to their levels prior to last month's increased tension in the Persian Gulf. But generally, world oil prices still range between $18 and $20 a barrel -- at or above OPEC's official quotes and nearly double the 1986 low. The relative firmness has been partly due to a rush to buy oil in recent weeks by refiners -- and speculators -- wanting additional inventories.    &quot;The only reason we don't have $15 oil today is because of the stocking-up over fears that the Persian Gulf (oil shipping) was going to be interrupted,&quot; says Norman P. Higby, a Menlo Park, Calif., energy forecaster.    Within a few weeks, Iraq will be pumping an additional 500,000 barrels a day through a new pipeline through Turkey. And, eventually, OPEC will have to deal with extra oil -- perhaps as much as two million barrels more a day -- that Iraq and Iran can produce once the war ends.    OPEC's frustrations could drag on for another three or four more years, says Daniel Yergin, the president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. But by then, he adds, the world's oil players will clearly be &quot;entering a new production environment&quot; in which the Persian Gulf nations will capture a commanding share of international petroleum markets. </TEXT></DOC>
