Overall, the two-year budget the Reagan administration releasedMonday proposes an increase in defense spending by 2 percent abovethe rate of inflation with $315.2 billion in budget authority for1990 and $330.89 billion for 1991.   Outlays _ the money to be spent during the 12 months of fiscal1990 _ total $303 billion, including $9.2 billion for EnergyDepartment nuclear weapons and research programs. Outlays for fiscal1991 amount to $314.4 billion.   President-elect Bush is expected to amend the Reagan budget afterhe takes office Jan. 20. The vice president has talked about abudget request that matches inflation instead of providing realgrowth.   If Bush fails to change the budget, Congress will surely do so.For the past four years, Congress has cut defense spending increasesto levels below the rate of inflation. The reaction from legislatorsto the latest Reagan budget indicates that this time will be nodifferent.   ``We know one thing about this defense budget, it isn't likely tobe approved the way it was submitted _ with an increase of 2 percentover and above inflation,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman ofthe House Armed Services Committee, in a statement he issued Friday.   ``What we need to know before Congress can go to work is whatGeorge Bush wants in his defense budget. I am eager not only to readthe new president's lips on defense, but also his first defensemessage to Congress,'' Aspin said.   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the SenateArmed Services Committee, said the budget is a ``good foundation,''but reserved comment until further study.   Among the requests likely to be changed by Congress or Bush are$94.6 million in spending authority in 1990 and $124.3 million thenext year for research on a new Navy anti-satellite weapon andelimination of a proposed single-warhead intercontinental ballisticmissile, the Midgetman.   The budget also calls for moving into production the new B-2stealth bomber, the Trident II submarine-launched nuclear missileand a rail-mobile version of the giant MX intercontinental ballisticmissile.   ``What worries me is the hasty rush to the next generation ofmilitary hardware,'' said Gordon Adams, director of the Center onBudget and Policy Priorities, an independent analysis group.   Congress is likely to question a budget that ``shaves the edgesof readiness and sustainability,'' Adams said.   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said the administration madesome hard choices in either canceling or delaying two dozenprograms, but the budget will not weaken the nation's ability todefend itself.   ``The moderate 2 percent real growth rate proposed in this budgetis an attempt to steer a sustainable and fiscally responsible coursethat allows the United States to maintain its current forcestructure and to acquire the weapons systems necessary to ensure ournational security,'' he said.   The budget includes an increase in spending authority on theStrategic Defense Initiative, commonly known as Star Wars, from $4.1billion in 1989 to $5.9 billion in 1990 and $7 billion in 1991.   Bush has said he supports Star Wars research, but it remainsunclear how quickly he will pursue the program.   Star Wars is a ``softball for cutting,'' according to Adams, whobelieves the inflated total will give Bush a chance to trim thebudget by about $2 billion.   ``SDI is destined to be no more than a research program,'' saidJohn Steinbruner, director of foreign policy studies at theBrookings Institution, a liberal think tank.   The budget plan also requests $500 million to begin shutting downunneeded military bases, reduce the Defense Department's civilianworkforce of 1.1 million by 5,000 people and shift more than twodozen existing weapon programs toward multi-year contracts.   Meanwhile, Reagan asked Congress for a small increase in fundingfor veterans' medical care and pensions as he proposed outlays of$29.9 billion for the new Department of Veterans Affairs.   Outlays for the Veterans Administration, which provided benefitsand services to veterans for 58 years, are estimated to be $29.2billion in fiscal 1989. The budget for the new department, whichassumes Cabinet status in March, calls for a $700 million increase.   Among the budget proposals are a slight increase in outlays formedical care, from $11.4 billion in 1989 to $11.5 billion in 1990.Proposed outlays for total pensions are $4 billion, a $94 millionincrease over the estimated total for fiscal 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
