The measure was approved 391-0 in the House and by voicevote in the Senate. The Bush administration had threatened aveto over the billion-barrel size, but aides said yesterdaythat the president is expected to sign the measure.</LP><TEXT>   Separately, Energy Secretary James Watkins told the SenateEnergy Committee that, despite concerns about refinerycapacity, the administration expects the nation to be able toget through the rest of the year without experiencingsignificant shortages of oil or refined products. But headded that the next meeting of the International EnergyAgency on Sept. 26 will be &quot;very key&quot; in determining whethera multilateral drawdown of emergency oil stockpiles isneeded.   In addition, Mr. Watkins unveiled a set of measuresdesigned to boost domestic energy production and spurconservation. With this package, the department's efforts todate are aimed at offsetting the loss of more than 1.1million barrels of oil daily by the end of 1991.   Separately, the Environmental Protection Agency releasedan analysis showing that clean-air legislation pending beforea House-Senate conference committee would save 800,000 to onemillion barrels of oil a day by the year 2005, when theprovisions are fully in place. Of this amount, 300,000 to500,000 barrels would come from utilities' switching tonatural gas from oil to meet requirements under sections ofthe bill aimed at curbing acid rain. The rest would resultfrom provisions requiring cleaner-burning fuels and the useof nongasoline-powered fleet vehicles and cars in somecities.   The legislation authorizing the continued buildup of thereserve doesn't set a deadline for filling it, whichcurrently contains about 590 million barrels of oil that thegoverment began stockpiling in salt domes in Louisiana andTexas in response to the 1973-1974 Arab oil embargo. The 750million mark was to have been reached by the mid-1990s.   The legislation also gives the administration additionalflexibility to conduct a test of the SPR, something somelawmakers and oil-industry officials have been clamoring forto ensure that in the event of an emergency, any drawdown ofoil would go smoothly. It also provides for a program inwhich the Energy Department would set up one or more reservesthat would be separate from the SPR and contain a refinedproduct, such as gasoline.   In increasing the reserve, the legislation also allows theU.S. to begin leasing some of the crude oil as a way toreduce the costs of filling it. In addition, it gives thepresident the authority to order a limited drawdown of theSPR to deal with a domestic disruption.   In his Energy Committee testimony, Secretary Watkins said,&quot;I do believe we can manage&quot; during the fourth quarterwithout serious shortages. He referred to the time betweennow and the end of the year as a &quot;transitional period&quot; whenefforts to increase production and conservation are takinghold at the same time demand is increasing as winterapproaches.   Still, he said the administration is &quot;very concerned aboutthe ability of refiners to continue operating at near-maximumcapacity for an extended period of time.&quot; Moreover, he saidthere is a problem with the quality of oil coming on line toreplace the lost Iraq and Kuwait crude and with thedistribution of supplies. Currently, he said, gasolineinventories are tight but adequate.   In his testimony, Mr. Watkins said that &quot;right now wedon't see any across-the-board gross unfairness&quot; by oilcompanies in responding to the Mideast crisis, though headded that &quot;a few percent&quot; are always going to try to takeadvantage of the situation. So far, he said, there has beenjust a &quot;normal market response.&quot;   Mr. Watkins said the various measures the department hasdesigned to increase domestic energy production and encourageindustry to switch to natural gas or other fuels would offset607,500 barrels of oil a day. Among major provisions, thedepartment will work to resolve a problem over permits thatis holding up production in the Beaufort Sea north of Alaska.In addition, the department urged Congress to open the ArcticNational Wildlife Refuge for exploration.   Moreover, Mr. Watkins said the agency would work toexpedite various natural-gas pipeline projects. He said thedepartment wants to remove regulatory barriers that preventthe delivery of natural gas to California, where it could beused to recover hard-to-get oil.   The department also wants to speed the permit process ofwaste-to-energy plants and accelerate the conversion of thefederal automobile fleet to non-gasoline fuels. As a firststep, Mr. Watkins announced the award of a $910,740 contractto Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. to provide 65vehicles that can run on either gasoline or an alternativefuel.   The conservation measures are aimed at saving 530,000barrels of oil a day. Mr. Watkins said the nation could save30,000 to 80,000 barrels of oil each day by reducing theaverage octane level to 87 from 88.5. Octane measures anengine's anti-knock capabilities.</TEXT></DOC>
