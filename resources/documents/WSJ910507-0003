The IBM price cuts, which range from 12% to 60%, follow bysix weeks a surprisingly aggressive series of workstationintroductions by Hewlett-Packard Co. Consultants andsecurities analysts say market leader Sun Microsystems Inc.and Digital Equipment Corp. also will probably have to cutprices before long. Digital and Sun declined to comment onpricing plans.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The competition is heating up, and prices are goingnowhere but south,&quot; said Steve Milunovich, a securitiesanalyst at Salomon Brothers.   The price competition isn't likely to reach the cutthroatlevel of personal computers just yet. Workstation makersstill can compete based on the technology in their boxes,while personal-computer companies must compete on pricebecause they use essentially the same parts. But because theHewlett-Packard introductions caught competitors unpreparedto respond in kind immediately, they are expected to turn topricing in the meantime.   Bill Filip, who runs IBM's workstation business,acknowledged in an interview that the price cuts are,&quot;frankly, a response to a number of competitive actions.&quot;   In announcing in late March that first-quarter operatingearnings would decline about 50%, IBM said even itsfast-growing workstation business wasn't doing quite as wellas hoped, and Mr. Filip said yesterday that little hadchanged since March. He added, however, that the workstationbusiness may still meet his goals for the year.   Mr. Filip said the sharpest of the price cuts occurredonly partly because of competitive pressure. He said IBM wasalso taking advantage of some manufacturing efficiencies onits high-end workstations and was hoping that the severereductions would attract a whole new range of corporatebuyers.   He said IBM was cutting the base price of one high-endsystem, the 550, to $52,500 from $130,000, even though thesystem only recently became available. Another highendmachine, the 950, had its price cut to $94,500 from $146,640even though it won't be available until next month. Inaddition, the main memory that comes with the 950 will bedoubled to 64 megabytes, or million characters of data. Thehard disk's size will be doubled, too, to 1.7 gigabytes, orbillion characters of data.   The IBM prices leave Hewlett-Packard with an edge, but atleast put IBM in the same ballpark as, and increase its edgeover, Sun and Digital in the much-watched ratio of price toperformance. Such comparisons are difficult, however.Hewlett-Packard lags well behind rivals in terms of thenumber of software application packages that run on itsmachines, for instance, while Sun has an edge in how easy itssystem software is to use.   &quot;The workstation market has always been pretty competitivewith pricing on the low end, but they're escalating the waron the high end for the first time,&quot; said Vicki Brown, ananalyst with International Data Corp., a market-research firmin Framingham, Mass.   She said the price cuts could position the biggerworkstations to take over more of the work traditionallyreserved for minicomputers. Workstations have typically beenused for high-powered scientific and engineering work. ButIBM's workstation business has been trying to place itsrelatively inexpensive machines throughout companies tocoordinate the traffic on networks of personal computers anddumb terminals, as the more-expensive minicomputers do.   Ms. Brown said the IBM price cuts may also be designed tolock in customers in anticipation of a high-end announcementSun is expected to make later this year.   The price cuts for the low end and the middle of the IBMline were much smaller than they were for the high end, butIBM sweetened the pot on almost all the machines by doublingthe amount of main memory. IBM can add memory more cheaplythan its competitors because it is the world's largest chipproducer, while almost all its competitors must buy theirmemory chips.   The lower prices still leave Hewlett-Packard with a bigprice-to-performance edge and leave IBM's entry price wellabove its competitors'. IBM has been expected to correct theentry-price problem by introducing a low-end machine for lessthan $10,000 late this summer, and Mr. Filip said that planis still on track.   IBM, Armonk, N.Y., also announced a faster version of itsFortran compiler, which translates instructions from asoftware application into a language that the hardware canunderstand. IBM said the compiler improves its machines'performance by 25% to 30%, although the gains will show uponly for heavy-duty number-crunching work, such as that doneby engineers.   IBM's competitors generally played down the significanceof IBM's move. An official at Digital Equipment's workstationgroup, who asked not to be identified, said: &quot;This wouldsuggest that IBM has to cut prices to get more outside sales.He said that Digital workstation salesmen seldom encountercompetition from IBM and speculated that many of IBM'sshipments may be internal or to developers. He added that &quot;ifthey have an under-$10,000 workstation, that would besignificant.&quot;   Anil Gadre, a marketing executive at Sun, noted that Sunlast week reported an exceptionally strong fiscal thirdquarter and suggested that Sun wouldn't have to react to IBM.&quot;Historically, people have responded to us rather than usresponding to them,&quot; he said.   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,IBM shares closed at $103.375, up $1.</TEXT></DOC>
