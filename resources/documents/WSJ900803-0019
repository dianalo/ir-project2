Mr. Bush issued two executive orders early yesterday, oneimposing an asset freeze and trade embargo against Iraq, theother blocking transfers of official Kuwaiti assets in theU.S. to shield them from Iraqi takeover.</LP><TEXT>   The combination of sanctions against Iraq is the mostsevere economic penalty the U.S. can impose against a nation.The order severs all transportation and financial linksbetween the two countries and bars U.S. citizens from workingin Iraq. But unlike the similar sanctions the U.S. placed onIran in 1979 during the hostage crisis, the moves againstIraq aren't expected to have much impact on the Arab nation.   A Commerce Department official said there is a &quot;limited&quot;U.S. business presence in Iraq. He estimated there are lessthan 100 Americans working there now, mainly as techniciansand engineers.   Also, U.S. officials say that Iraq has only minimal assetsin the U.S., and U.S. companies export only about $1.2billion in goods -- mostly farm products -- to Iraq. Iraq canquickly make up for the $2.3 billion in oil it ships to theU.S. from the price increases it will cause by taking overKuwait's oil fields.   In the U.S., banks acted quickly on the president'sorders. The manager of international money transfer at amajor New York bank said that by 6 a.m. yesterday, his bank,and presumably other big U.S. banks, had shut down thetransfers of Kuwaiti and Iraqi assets.   Handling the freeze against Iraq won't be a problembecause of the country's small holdings in the U.S. ThomasSams, who runs the Iraq desk at the Commerce Department,called Baghdad's holdings here &quot;minuscule.&quot;   But dealing with Kuwait's huge assets could be morecomplicated, because they are divided between official, orgovernment holdings, which are blocked, and private assets,which aren't covered by the president's order. U.S. officialssay they don't know how big Kuwait's U.S. holdings are.According to the Commerce Department's tabulation of holdingsin real estate and major corporate shares, Kuwait's directinvestment in the U.S. totaled $4.2 billion last year.   But officials estimate that private and official Kuwaiti&quot;portfolio&quot; investment in stocks and bonds could amount to anadditional $35 billion to $55 billion, for total U.S.holdings of about $40 billion to $60 billion. However, someprivate analysts estimate that the holdings are far smaller.Sharif Ghalib at the Institute for International Finance, forexample, says his calculations show total Kuwaiti assets of$15 billion in the U.S.   Michael Bradfield, an attorney in the Washington office ofJones Day Reavis andamp; Pogue who specializes in banking, saysthat &quot;sorting out what's public and what's private in a placelike Kuwait is extremely difficult. It will put judgmentalburdens on banks that they certainly would rather not have.The Kuwaitis have assets all over the place and sorting allthat out is going to be a long-term problem, assuming thesituation remains as it is.&quot;   The Kuwaiti Investment Office, the financial arm of thegovernment, has major stockholdings in a number of companies,including British Petroleum Co. In addition, private Kuwaitiinvestors have broad interests in real estate, retailing andother U.S. assets.   Santa Fe International Corp., Alhambra, Calif., apetroleum concern acquired by the Kuwaitis in 1981 for $2.5billion, said it continues normal business operations.   John J. Mika, vice president administration, said in aninterview that communications with the State and Treasurydepartments indicate that &quot;the freeze isn't intended to bepunitive to companies such as Santa Fe International.&quot; Mr.Mika said the company, with about 2,000 employees world-wide,issued its normal payroll yesterday.   Commercial relations between the U.S. and Iraq have beenrelatively slow to develop, aside from oil purchases andannual shipments of about $1 billion of rice, wheat, corn andsoybean products to Iraq. Washington and Baghdad didn't havefull relations until 1984, and then Iraq's bitter war withIran limited commercial opportunity. After the war ended twoyears ago, U.S. interest began to pick up. General MotorsCorp. negotiated to assemble cars in Iraq, and construction,irrigation and other companies began to look for businessthere.   The sanctions will end about $200 million in short-termExport-Import Bank insurance for shipments of U.S.manufactured goods, and agricultural credits that have rangedfrom $500 million to $1 billion a year recently. Butyesterday, Iraq announced that it was suspending repaymentson $2.2 billion of credits it owes the U.S.   Yesterday the House voted 416-0 to authorize an embargo onvirtually all trade with Iraq and to impose new sanctions,including tighter standards on the export of manufacturedgoods and technology to Baghdad. The bill goes beyond theadministration in some areas and would give Congress greaterleverage in reviewing any future decision by Mr. Bush to liftthe restrictions.   ---   David Rogers in Washington and Frederick Rose in LosAngeles contributed to this article.   ---              How the Crisis Boiled Over                                                                                                          July 17 -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein denouncesPersian Gulf countries that exceed their production quotas,accusing them of stabbing Iraq in the back.
