President Bush's aides said the proposal would eliminateor substantially ease controls on 40 of 120 productcategories that currently are under export restrictions tothose countries, and create a more practical list &quot;fromscratch.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The Commerce Department said the proposed changes wouldeliminate licensing requirements for U.S. exports valued atbillions of dollars annually.   The Bush plan would release most off-the-shelf personalcomputers from the existing controls and give certain EasternEuropean countries access to some mainframe computers such asInternational Business Machines Corp.'s 4381 MG24, DigitalEquipment Corp.'s VAX 800 and Control Data Corp.'s Cyber 910.The use of these mainframes could rapidly improve EasternEurope's performance in banking, airline reservations andlight industry, U.S. officials said.   A spokesman for IBM, in Armonk, N.Y., called the proposal&quot;a very modest first step.&quot; He said that criticalapplications -- such as banking, education and health-caresystems -- &quot;require substantially more computing power thanis provided by this order.&quot;   Some of the applications cited by U.S. officials -- suchas banking and airline-reservation systems -- have appetitesfor computing power that are among the most ravenous of anycomputer applications now in use. Those applications tend torun on hardware that has 10 to 15 times the computing powerof the systems that could be exported to Eastern Europe underthe Bush administration proposal.   Meanwhile, a spokesman for Maynard, Mass.-based DigitalEquipment said, &quot;We're quite encouraged by this. We see it asa positive.&quot; He said that under the new proposal, Digitalcould sell its MicroVAX 3000 line in areas where itpreviously was limited to selling five-year old MicroVAX 2computers.   The White House announcement capped three months ofintensive interagency discussions on how the U.S. can meetthe demands of its allies for liberalized trade with theSoviet Union and Eastern Europe. The Coordinating Committeeon Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, the forum in whichthe U.S. discusses such issues with its allies, will hold ahigh-level meeting in June in Paris to discuss these issues.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the U.S. wantsCocom to complete work on the new &quot;core list&quot; by year end.However, the U.S. recommendations for Eastern Europe could beacted on more quickly because many prospective transactionsawait such decisions.   In addition to giving Eastern European countries favoredtreatment in importing mainframe computers, the U.S. also isproposing to allow those countries to obtain moderntelecommunications equipment, including fiber-optic circuitswith a capacity of as much as 156 megabits and some microwavetransmission systems.   The U.S. proposal isn't likely to go far enough to suitWest Germany and other European members of Cocom. However,Dennis Kloske, undersecretary of commerce for exportadministration, said it would &quot;allow us to engage in a realand substantive discussion with the allies.&quot;   The White House, heeding the intelligence community'sadvice, decided to keep most digital switching equipment onthe restricted list, even for Eastern Europe. The U.S.,though, is agreeable to eliminating all export controls oncertain cellular communications systems and satellite groundstations, the White House said.   The reaction of U.S. industry groups was mixed, though.Richard Iverson, president of the American ElectronicsAssociation, called the core-list proposal &quot;terrific&quot; becauseit signifies the administration's intention to catch up withrapidly changing events in Europe. But he also said that theadministration should have gone further in easing controls oncomputers and added digital switching equipment to the listof unrestricted products.   John Pickitt, president of the Computer and BusinessMachines Manufacturers Association, said he hopes there is&quot;negotiating room&quot; in the U.S. proposal so that somerefinements can be made at the Cocom meetings.   U.S. officials insist that the White House proposal isgenerous concerning computers since it would eliminatecontrols on most personal computers using Intel Corp.'s 80386microprocessor, which represents mid-1980s technology. Thesemodels, which are among the most widely used in thenoncommunist world, include IBM's AS 400, Control Data'sCyber 840 and Hewlett Packard Co.'s 3000, Commerce Departmentofficials said.   Apple Computer Inc., the Cupertino, Calif., personalcomputer manufacturer, said that the proposals, if accepted,would open for Eastern bloc distribution its entire MacintoshPC line. Such a move wouldn't endanger national security, anApple spokeswoman said, who added that the company recentlybegan evaluating Eastern European markets on acountry-by-country basis. It's still too early to say how thecompany would sell and distribute its PCs there, given thedifferent currencies and the lack of distribution systems,the spokeswoman said.   State Department officials said the White Houseannouncement reflects the work of many agencies, includingthe Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency. ThePentagon previously resisted significant changes in the Cocomlist, but Defense Secretary Richard Cheney finally consentedto the proposal, a senior Pentagon aide said.   The U.S. also proposes to remove restrictions onnumerically controlled machine tools with an accuracy asclose as two to three microns; a micron equals one thousandthof a millimeter. Under the current rules, Cocom countriescan't ship to the Soviet Union machine tools with a precisionof less than 10 microns.   The proposed changes are likely to benefit U.S. vendorsmost in the computer field and Western European suppliersmost in machine tools. U.S. and Western European companiesare in toe-to-toe competition for telecommunicationsequipment sales in Eastern Europe.   The U.S. will also urge Cocom to give favorable licensingtreatment to Eastern European countries that adoptCocom-approved safeguards against the reshipment ofcontrolled goods to unauthorized users. A Pentagon officialsaid these safeguards could include on-site verification, thepassage of export-control laws, and some degree of&quot;intelligence-sharing&quot; with Cocom suppliers.</TEXT></DOC>
