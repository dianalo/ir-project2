This study was designed to evaluatethe late-occurring biological effects resulting from the alpha emissionfrom /sup 238/Pu. Although the /sup 238/PuO/sub 2/ particles were veryinsoluble when inhaled, they fragmented and dissolved with time, resultingin translocation of /sup 238/Pu from the lung to skeleton and liver.Several dogs died with radiation pneumonitis from one to six years afterexposure. In addition, adenocarcinomas of the lung were found. The mostcommon cause of death was from osteosarcoma. The types of osteosarcomasobserved included osteoblastic, chondroblastic, fibroblastic, telangiectatic,and combined type. The bone tumors were associated with, and appearedto arise from, areas of radiation osteodystrophy. A fibrosarcoma of theliver has also occurred. Degenerative liver changes were found in mostdogs but their significance remains unclear. Because of the distributionof /sup 238/Pu in the body after inhalation exposure, the biologicaleffects present, often in the same dog, a complex array involving morethan one organ system. This implies that people inhaling /sup 238/Puare at risk to develop cancers in several organ systems with the principlerisk being to the skeleton.</TEXT></DOC>
