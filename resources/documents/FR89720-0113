Introduction and Background </ITAG>The New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE or ``Exchange'') submitted onJuly 13, 1988,\1\<NOTE/> copies of a proposed rule change, and on December 8, 1988and June 23, 1989, copies of amendments to that proposal,\2\<NOTE/> pursuant to section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Actof 1934 (``Act'')\3\<NOTE/> and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\4\<NOTE/> to modify the Exchange's shareholder approval policy fordomestic companies, as set forth in andSection; 312.00 of the NYSE ListedCompany Manual. The proposal will continue to require shareholder approvalas a prerequisite to listing securities to be issued in certain circumstancesas set forth in the policy, but will revise the circumstances triggeringthe shareholder vote requirement, and provide definitions and exceptionsto the policy.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ This filing was published for comment in Securities ExchangeAct Release No. 25944 (July 26, 1988), 53 FR 28930 (August 1, 1988). TheCommission received four written comments along with a written responseby the NYSE to these comments as discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The December 8, 1988 and June 23, 1989 Amendments (respectively,Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2), which were approved by the Exchange'sBoard on July 6, 1989, were published for comment in Securities ExchangeAct Release No. 26959 (June 23, 1989), 54 FR 27259 (June 28, 1989), thetext of which are discussed below. <T3>See </T3>notes 12 and 13 <T3>infra </T3>and accompanying text. No comments were received on theseamendments. The NYSE has also requested that the changes proposed in AmendmentNo. 2 be approved on an accelerated basis. <T3>See </T3>letter from Daniel P.

The NYSE's proposal to amend its shareholder approval policy was the resultof the Exchange's review, begun in 1984, of its voting rights policies.In June 1984, the Exchange formed the Subcommittee on Shareholder Participationand Qualitative Listing Standards (``Subcommittee'') to consider the continuedrelevance and appropriateness of the Exchange's voting rights policieswhich included the so-called one share, one vote \5\<NOTE/> and shareholder approval policies.\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25891 (July 7, 1988),53 FR 26376 in which the Commission adopted Rule 19c-4 under the Act, ananti-disinfranchisement rule that applies to all national securities exchangesand associations. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ At that time, the Exchange declared a moratorium on compliancewith its one share, one vote rule and its shareholder approval policy forthe period necessary to complete a review of these rules. The NYSE believedthat it would not be able to provide its listed companies any real guidanceon how their proposed transactions would be viewed until the Exchange completedits review of its voting rights policies and modified such policies. Currently, Paragraph 312 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual requires priorshareholder approval as a pre-requisite to the listing of securities issuedin connection with certain transactions. These transaction relate primarilyto issuances of common stock or securities convertible into common stock\7\<NOTE/> in connection with: (a) Options granted to or special remunerationplans for directors, officers and key employees; (b) actions resultingin a change of control; (c) transactions involving the acquisition of propertyfrom directors, officers and substantial security holders; (d) transactionsinvolving the issuance of 18\1/2\% or more of the outstanding common sharesfor acquisitions of a business, company or other assets or property; \8\<NOTE/> and (e) transactions where the present or potential issuanceof common stock and any other consideration has a combined fair value of18\1/2\% or more of the market value of the outstanding common shares.\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ This would not include issuances solely involving a publicoffering for cash. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The term ``acquisitions'' has been interpreted by theNYSE to include, among other things, issuances of securities for cash.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Both the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'') andthe National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') have similarprovisions. The Amex's shareholders' approval policy requires shareholderapproval for, among other things, approval of applications to list additionalshares issued in connection with an acquisition where the present or potentialissuance could result in an increase in outstanding common shares of 20%or more. <T3>See </T3>Amex Company Guide Section 712. The Amex has filed a proposedrule change with the Commission to amend certain provisions of this policy.<T3>See </T3>SR-Amex-88-26. The NASD has a similar requirement, but appliesa 25% threshold standard rather than 20% and additionally requires shareholderapproval for actions resulting in a change in control of the issuer. <T3>See </T3>Part III, section 5(i)(1) of Schedule D of the NASD By-Laws.Pursuant to its review, the Subcommittee noted that certain provisionsof the current shareholder approval policy have proven difficult for theExchange staff to apply. In addition, the Exchange noted that the Subcommitteewas unable to find any conceptual basis for selecting 18\1/2\% as the standard,rather than some other figure, with respect to the issuance of stock inacquisitions.\1\\0\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\Several years ago, the standard with respect to issuancesof stock in acquisitions was ``approximately 20%.'' Overtime, the Exchangestaff increasingly interpreted this standard as meaning 18\1/2\%, withthe result that this figure became a fixed standard. Pursuant to its review, the Subcommittee submitted its initial recommendationsto the NYSE's Legal Advisory Committee (``LAC''). After review by the LAC,the Subcommittee's recommendations were returned for further modificationand revision. Subsequently, the Subcommittee's final recommended modificationsto the Exchange's current shareholder approval policy received the concurrenceof the LAC. The Subcommittee recommended that the Exchange retain its present shareholderapproval policy with certain modifications which, according to the NYSE,were designed to simplify the Exchange's administration of the policy andconform it to more realistic standards.\11\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\As initially proposed, the modified policy also receivedconcurrence for the Exchange's Listed Company Advisory Committee and AmericanSociety of Corporate Secretaries. On July 7, 1988, the Board of Directorsof the Exchange approved the proposed policy modifications. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Description of the Proposal </ITAG>The NYSE proposes to amend its shareholder approval policy set forth inandSection;312.00 of its Listed Company Manual in several ways. First, therule proposal would identify those situations where a shareholder voteis needed for the issuance of securities in connection with the acquisitionof property from directors, officers or substantial security holders orany company or party in which such persons have a direct or indirect interest.Under the proposal, shareholder approval would not be required for theissuance of securities in connection with the acquisition of property fromdirectors, officers or shareholders who hold less than 5% of the outstandingshares of the company or less than 5% of the company's voting power, orto an acquisition of an entity or property in which directors, officersand 5% shareholders of the listed company had interests aggregating lessthan 5%. Further, shareholder approval would not be required if the issuancesof securities in connection with the acquisition of property from an officer,director or substantial security holder represents less than 1% of thenumber of shares or voting power outstanding prior to the issuance. Second, the threshold amount for requiring shareholder approval for certainissuances of common stock in connection with acquisitions would be increasedfrom the current 18\1/2\% standard to 20%. The Exchange originally proposedto raise this standard to 25%, but reduced it to 20% in Amendment No. 2to the proposed rule change. The proposal also would amend the rule toapply to total voting power\1\\2\<NOTE/> in addition to the stock outstanding at the time of the issuanceand to specifically exclude public offerings for cash. Accordingly, anysuch issuances of securities, other than a public offering for cash, wouldrequire shareholder approval if the securities issued represented 20% ormore of the outstanding voting power or shares outstanding prior to theissuance. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\The Exchange proposes to define ``voting power outstanding''as the aggregate number of votes which may be cast by holders of thosesecurities outstanding which entitles the holders thereof to vote generallyon all matters submitted to the company's security holders for a vote.<T3>See </T3>NYSE Amendment No. 2, at 3. Third, the proposal would eliminate the requirement for shareholder approvalof transactions involving a combination of the issuance of common stock<T3>and </T3>any other consideration which has a fair value of 18\1/2\%or more of the market value of the outstanding common shares and the commonshare portion represents a market value in excess of 5% of the market valueof the common shares. Fourth, the policy requires shareholder approval prior to listing securitiesissued pursuant to options and special renumeration plans\1\\3\<NOTE/> for directors, officers and key employees. The proposal woulddelete key employees from this provision. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\<T3>See </T3>NYSE Amendment No. 1, and text accompanying note 15, <T3>infra. </T3>As initially proposed this provision required shareholderapproval prior to the adoption of such a plan. Finally, the Exchange proposes to grant financial distress exceptions toandSection;312.03(c), which is the provision requiring shareholder approvalfor any issuance of common stock, other than a public offering for cash,where the issuance is equal to 20% or more of the outstanding common stockor voting power. Under the proposal the financial distress exception wouldbe available if: (a) Delaying the issuance in order to obtain shareholderapproval would jeopardize the company's existence; (b) the company's auditcommittee approved the waiver; and (c) appropriate notice of such actionis sent to all shareholders of the company at least 10 days prior to theissuance. The proposed rule change as originally filed with the Commission, would``grandfather'' those companies which had issued shares in violation ofthe current policy during the period in which the Exchange's voting rightspolicies were under review by the Committee. In Amendment No. 2 the NYSEhas proposed to extend this grandfather period through the filing of thisAmendment. The Exchange stated that the decision to grandfather companiesin this manner is consistent with the position taken by the Exchange regardingthose companies which had violated the Exchange's one share, one vote policywhile that policy was under review by the Committee. The NYSE also had proposed that the requirement of a shareholder vote forthe issuance of securities resulting in a change in control be deleted.In Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change, the Exchange reinstatedthis requirement.   <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Summary of Comments</ITAG>Four comment letters were received regarding the NYSE proposal.\14\<NOTE/> Two of the commentators focused their discussion solely ona proposed amendment to subsection (1) of andSection;312.00 which would haverequired shareholder approval of options and special remuneration plansfor directors or officer prior to the adoption of the plan. These commentatorsexpressed concerns that the proposed rule would effectively change thelong established practice under the existing rule of permitting NYSE listedcompanies to adopt such a plan prior to shareholder approval, as long asno securities are actually issued under the plan until after shareholderapproval is received.\15\<NOTE/> In response to this comment, the NYSE amended its proposedrule change to clarify that approval need be secured only prior to theissuance of securites under the plan.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ All of these comment letters were submitted to the Commissionin response to the Exchange's initial proposal. No comments were receivedregarding NYSE Amendment No. 1 or NYSE Amendment No. 2. <T3>See </T3>letters from Joseph E. Bachelder, Esq. (``Bachelder'') toJonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated September 27, 1988; Philip L. Ball,Esq. (``Ball'') to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated August 19, 1988;Frank M. Macoice, Jr., First Vice President and Assistant General Counsel,Merrill Lynch (``Merrill Lynch'') to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC datedAugust 30, 1988; and Sullivan andamp; Cromwell (``Sullivan andamp; Cromwell''to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated August 22, 1988. The NYSE formallyresponded to these comment letters. <T3>See</T3> Letter from David Domijan, Senior Vice President, New Listingsandamp; Corporate Liaison, NYSE to Howard L. Kramer, Esq., Assistant Director,SEC, dated November 28, 1988 (``NYSE Response'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ <T3>See</T3> Bachelder letter; Merrill Lynch letter.Sullivan andamp; Cromwell generally supported the NYSE's proposed changesto andSection;312.00, but made two suggestions regarding language additionsto the propsed rule. First, it was suggested that the word ``related''be added to the phrase ``any transaction or series of transactions'' asthat phrase is used in andSection;312.00(c) as proposed. Sullivan andamp; Cromwellbelieved that this would eliminate some of the subjectivity of determiningwhat constitutes a series of transactions.\16\<NOTE/> The NYSE incorporated this recommendation in Amendment No.1. Second, Sullivan andamp; Cromwell addressed the provision which statesthat shareholder approval may not be required for issuances to a personnot previously employed by the company if the securities are issued asan inducement essential to entering into an employment contract. They suggestedthat the proposal more specifically indicate that shareholder approval``is not'' required rather than ``may not be'' required in such a case,and that the requirement that the issuances of securities must be an ``essential''inducement to employment be eliminated from the policy. Sullivan andamp;Cromwell believed that as proposed this provision would be subject to considerablesubjective interpretation which could be eliminated by amending the proposedlanguage as described above.\17\<NOTE/> In response to this comment, the Exchange stated that thetext relating to the granting of options as an inducement to employmentreflects the Exchange's current and consistent practice, as set forth inandSection;703.09(A) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. Accordingly, theExchange did not amend this section as suggested by the commentator.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ <T3>See</T3> Sullivan andamp; Cromwell.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ <T3>SEe</T3> NYSE response, <T3>supra</T3> note 14.Finally, one commentator recommended four changes to the proposed rulechange. Mr. Ball suggested that the proposed rule provide for the following:(1) A 1% exception from andSection;312.03(a) for granting of options to meeta ``raid'' on a company's personnel or otherwise retain personnel; (2)that the 20% threshold test (originally proposed as 25%) be measured ona fully-diluted common stock basis to reflect more accurately the impacton shareholders of such issuances; (3) that stock dividends and stock splitsshould be excluded from andSection;312.03(c) regarding the issuance of 20%(25%) or more of outstanding shares or voting power in any transactionsor series of transactions; and (4) that the Paragraph 312.05 defintionof the minimum vote necessary to constitute shareholder approval shoulddistinguish between votes actually present and cast at an anual meetingversus the use of consents in lieu of convening an annual meeting and thatabstentions should not affect the minimum vote required for quorum purposes.\18\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ The NYSE did not believe that any changes recommendedby Mr. Ball were appropriate. With respect to Mr. Ball's first comment,the NYSE stated that during the course of the Committee's review of theExchange's shareholder approval policy, the only de minimis exception deemedappropriate related to transactions with officers and directors as setforth in proposed 312.03(b). In regard to the second issue raised, theNYSE stated that there is no reason to change the manner in which it traditionallyhas applied the outstanding common share threshold. In response to Mr.Ball's third point, the NYSE noted that the policy does notapply to stockdividends and stock splits because they are distributions rather than transactions.Finally, the NYSE responded to Mr. Ball's last comment by stating thatthe appropriate standard for determining the minimum vote necessary toconstitute approval is, and should remain, based on votes cast.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Discussion </ITAG>The Commission carefully has reviewed the NYSE's filing, as amended, aswell as the comment letters submitted with respect to the proposal, todetermine whether the proposed modifications to andSection;312.00 are consistentwith the Act. The Commission believes that the proposed rule change isconsistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act which, among other things, requiresExchange rules to ``remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism ofa free and open market and in general to protect investors and the publicinterest.'' The NYSE traditionally has required certain minimum standards of corporategovernance for its listed companies. The NYSE, in adopting the proposedrule change, has reiterated its belief that approval of certain significantcorporate transactions is an important aspect of its corporate governancelisting standards. It has proposed the changes contained in SR-NYSE-88-19in order to improve the application of the policy. For reasons discussedbelow, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change achieves thisobjective without vitiating the underlying purpose of the Shareholder ApprovalPolicy. First, the Commission notes that several of the proposed modificationswill enhance the objectivity of the application of the policy to specifictransactions. By deleting the term ``key employee'' from andSection;312.03(a)the Exchange will eliminate the uncertainty of determining who properlywould be characterized as such an employee for purposes of this provision.\1\\9\<NOTE/> Moreover, the proposed modification to andSection;312.03(b)will establish an objective standard in determining who is a ``substantialsecurity holder'' and whether an officer, director or substantial securityholder has a substantial interest in property for purposes of requiringshareholder approval for an acquisition of property from such a person.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\<T3>See </T3>text accompany note 13, <T3>supra</T3>. Second, the Commission believes that the NYSE's determination not to requireshareholder approval for insignificant or deminimus acquisitions, <T3>i.e., </T3>involving issuances of less than 1% of the outstanding commonstock or voting power, from officers, directors and substantial securityholders is reasonable. This change will enable companies to enter intosuch limited transactions without the burden of allowing for the time tocall a shareholders meeting and for solicitation of proxies. The Commissionnotes that it is reasonable for the NYSE to have determined that the burdenupon issuers in such a situation may outweigh the benefits to be gainedby requiring shareholder participation in such minor transactions. Similarly,by expressly amending the rule to take into account the ``voting poweroutstanding'' in addition to the number of shares outstanding when determiningwhen a shareholder vote is needed for various issuances\2\\0\<NOTE/> the rule will focus more specifically on the actual effectof an issuance on shareholders. This is particularly true for companieswith dual class capital structures, where the classes have different votingrights. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\For example, the policy would now require shareholderapproval for transactions involving issuances of common stock representing20% or more of the outstanding voting power of the common stock prior tothe issuance in addition to issuances of 20% or more of the number of sharesof common stock outstanding prior to the issuance. Third, the Commission believes that the exemption from shareholder approvalfor financially troubled companies is an appropriate and limited adjustmentto the application of the policy. We note that the exemption is only availablewhere the time necessary to obtain approval would jeopardize the continuedexistence of the company, and where the company's independent audit committee\2\\1\<NOTE/> has approved the waiver. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\The NYSE requires companies to establish and maintainan audit committee comprised solely of directors independent of managementand free from any relationship that, in the opinion of the Board of Directors,would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment as a Committeemember. <T3>See </T3>Paragraph 303.00 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. Fourth, the Commission believes that retention of the policy's requirementfor shareholder approval of actions resulting in a change of control,\2\\2\<NOTE/> will provide the Exchange with the flexibility and discretionnecessary in ascertaining whether shareholder approval is appropriate withregard to a particular issuance of less than 20% of the common stock orvoting power of the issuer. In this regard, the Commission notes that dependingon the facts of the particular transaction, such an issuance may be sufficientin some situations to accomplish such a change in control.\2\\3\<NOTE/> Although the Exchange originally intended the proposed rulechange to remove subjectivety from its application of the policy, the Exchangedid not intend to alter the Policy's purpose of ensuring shareholder ratificationof significant issuances of securities. Clearly, an issuance resultingin a change of control is significant. Accordingly, its retention is importantto the effectiveness of the policy, although it is less ``objective'' thanthe other provisions of the Policy as amended. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\As intially proposed, the rule change eliminated thechange of control provision from the policy. The Exchange, however, determinedto retain this provision. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\We note that in proposing to eliminate the change ofcontrol standard, the NYSE stated that there is a widely held belief thatthe ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding common shares or votingpower in a widely held company in most instances constitutes control. Accordingly,the NYSE had concluded that the specific threshold standard in the rulefor shareholder approval should encompass most change of control situations.The decision to retain the change of control standard recognizes, however,that in some situations issuances of less than 20% (25%, as originallyproposed) may also constitute a change of control that should require shareholderapproval. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is appropriate for theNYSE to retain its change of control standard, because the specific thresholdpercentage may not, as NYSE originally envisioned, encompass all changeof control situations. Fifth, the Commission recognizes that the proposed rule will permit sometransactions without shareholder approval that would not be permitted bythe current policy as a result of increasing the 18\1/2\% threshold standardto 20%, and eliminating the requirement for shareholder approval of tranactionsinvolving the issuance of common stock in combination with any other considerationwhich has a specific fair value of 18\1/2\% or more of the market valueof the outstanding stock. The Commission, however, believes that the increaseof 18\1/2\% to 20% represents a <T3>de minimis </T3>change to this provision. Moreover, as noted above,the policy's change of control provision will afford the Exchange the flexibilityto analyze the facts and circumstances of a particular transaction to determineif shareholder approval is appropriate as a result of a change of control,even though the tranaction may fall below the 20% standard. The deletionof the fair value provision removes the difficult and subjective determinationas to the value of the ``other consideration.'' In addition, this deletionproperly limits NYSE shareholder vote requirements to situations wherethe issuance of securities is central to the transaction in question. As noted above, the NYSE proposes to provide grandfathered status for allcompanies which had issued shares in violation of the current shareholderapproval policy during the period that the Exchange conducted its reviewof this policy, and extended through the filing of Amendment No. 2. Whilethe Commission is concerned about those shareholders who were deprivedof their right, pursuant to andSection;312.00, to vote on certain importantcorporate decisions, the Commission believes that it is not inconsistentwith the Act to grandfather companies as proposed by the NYSE. In arrivingat this decision, the Commission has taken into account the fact that thesecompanies entered into otherwise violative transactions at a time whenthe Exchange had declared a moratorium on the application and enforcementof its shareholder approval policy.\2\\4\<NOTE/> The Commission is sensitive to the fact that the Exchangewas not able to provide these companies with effective guidance on howtheir proposed transactions would be viewed once the Exchange completedits review of its shareholder approval policy and modified that policy.\2\\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\The reasons for the moratorium are discussed in SecuritiesExchange Act Release No. 25891 (July 7, 1988), 53 FR 26376. The Commissionviews the moratorium as a unique circumstance without any precedentialvalue for future Exchange actions regarding enforcement of its rules. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\As noted above, the Commission previously has grandfatheredcompanies that issued stock in violation of the NYSE's one share, one votepolicy during its moratorium. <T3>See </T3>Section II and note 24, <T3>supra. </T3>The Commission can find no justification for treating thosecompanies that violated the NYSE shareholder approval policy during thismoratorium any differently. The Commission finds good cause for approving this proposed rule changeprior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of AmendmentsNo. 1 and No. 2 in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>in that the proposed modifications to the Exchange'sshareholder approval policy previously were noticed\2\\6\<NOTE/> and the subsequent amendments to the initial filing wereeither nonsubstantive clarifying changes or reflect changes that make theshareholder approval policy closer in substance to the standards set forthin the existing policy rather than make additional changes to the proposedmodified policy. Moreover, the Commission has not received any commentsregarding the proposed amendments. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\<T3>See </T3>notice of proposed rule change, <T3>supra </T3>note 1. We note that the notice on the original proposalwas issued more than 30 days ago. Based on the above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changeis consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulationsthereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and in particular,the requirements of Section 6 and the rules and regulations thereunder.<T3>It is therefore ordered, </T3>Pursuant to section 19(b)(2)\2\\7\<NOTE/> of the Act, that the above mentioned proposed rule changebe, and hereby is approved.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\7\15 U.S.C. 785(b)(2) (1982). <ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority.\2\\8\<NOTE/> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\15 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
