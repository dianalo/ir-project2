JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Janice Walsh was eager to take the Nissan300ZX for a test drive. Like many potential buyers, she wants ``acar that's fun,'' regardless of its gas mileage. Automakers aregiving her what she wants.   Mileage statistics for 1991 model cars released Tuesday by theEnvironmental Protection Agency show virtually no gains in averagefuel efficiency since 1987 with more than half the cars gettingfewer than 23 miles per gallon.   While midsize and many of the ``performance'' cars such as theNissan 300ZX are getting much better mileage today than a decadeago, the EPA said ``overall fleet fuel economy figures haveincreased only slightly'' since 1982.   Over the last five model years, the average fleet figures havebeen stuck at about 28 mpg. The EPA said the 1991 models about tobe introduced average 28.1 mpg, a shade higher than last year, butno better than figures for 1987.   Down the road from where Ms. Walsh and her young son eyed theNissan that gets 18 mpg in the city, John Webb and his wife lookedover a Mercury Grand Marquis - a big car with a V-8 engine and acavernous trunk.   ``When we travel we want a good size car and lots of trunkspace,'' said Webb, a retiree who says the Marquis fits the billalthough its city mileage is a thirsty 17 mpg.   ``We really haven't talked about mileage,'' Webb said.   The Persian Gulf crisis has prompted renewed efforts in Congressto require automakers to improve fuel economy.   But Tuesday, the Senate voted 57-42 to block legislation thatwould require automakers to dramatically increase the averagemileage of their fleets to 40 mpg by 2001, a 40 percent increasefrom today's average of about 28 mpg. The vote ended any chance thebill will pass this year.   President Bush had threatened to veto the bill if it had clearedCongress and there was formidable opposition in the House as well.   Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen and a frequentcritic of the auto industry, accused automakers of pushing ``biggerengines, more muscle and acceleration which they call performance''instead of trying to make cars more fuel efficient.   ``They want to sell speed instead of fuel economy,'' saidClarence Ditlow, head of the Washington-based Center for AutoSafety. ``The performance cars are the higher priced cars and theones with more options and more profits.''   But those in the auto business say they're only giving thecustomer what he or she wants.   ``It's not the industry pushing performance. It's the consumerthat's been demanding it in the last few years,'' argues Ray Turk,the Nissan salesman at Herb Gordon AutoWorld in suburban Marylandwhere Ms. Walsh was shopping.   As in previous years, the 1991 models reflected a wide range ofmileage from the minicompact Geo Metro that gets 58 mpg on thehighway and only slightly less in city driving to the luxurioustwo-seater Lamborghini Diablo that guzzles at 9 mpg on citystreets.   In between are about 1,000 models and variations of models ofcars, trucks and vans.   The EPA list includes only 35 cars subject to a gasoline``guzzler'' tax that kicks in for cars getting 22.5 mpg or less andin the case of the Lamborghini Diablo amounts to $3,200.   But those numbers may be misleading.   For tax purposes, only the raw fuel economy test scores areused, not the lower EPA figures that are adjusted through amathematical formula to better reflect actual driving conditions.Increasingly popular passenger vans, speciality vehicles and trucksalso are excluded.   Using the adjusted EPA figures, more than half the cars listedshowed a fuel economy of fewer than 22.5 mpg with the averagemileage for increasingly popular passenger vans and 4-wheel drivespeciality vehicles coming in at fewer than 20 mpg.   Four of the 10 cars with the best fuel economy were variationsof the Geo, a Japanese-built car sold through General Motors.   The others were two variations of the Honda Civic, two versionsof the Suzuki Swift, the Daihatsu Charade and the diesel-poweredVolkswagen Jetta, all with mileage estimates of between 37 mpg and49 mpg in the city and 43 mpg to 52 mpg on the highway.   At the other extreme were the Lamborghini Diablo, five versionsof the Rolls-Royce, two BMWs and a pair of Ferraris. None of the 10vehicles achieved more than 12 mpg in city driving.   According to industry figures, those worst and best performersaccount for only a small fraction of the vehicles likely to be onthe nation's highways. The industry estimates cars that get betterthan 40 mpg account for less than 3 percent of sales, while theluxury cars that make up the worst mileage performers are far fewerin number.   Energy conservation advocates and environmentalists said thelatest figures demonstrate the failure of the auto industry to pushfuel economy in marketing and research.</TEXT></DOC>
