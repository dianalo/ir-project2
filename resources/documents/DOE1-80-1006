The purpose of the study was to determine the fair marketvalue of the oil- and gas-producing properties purchased during thatperiod and to derive the oil and gas price projections, inflationaryexpectations, investment requirements, remaining reserves, payout, andthe rate of return expected from the acquisition by purchasers. Whileoriginally used as a basis for property taxation analysis, the studyhas been expanded to include the trend of change in evaluation criteriaover the 3-year time span during which oil and gas prices and corporateeconomic and investment policies have undergone significant changes.The time relation of specific evaluation criteria derived from actualsales and purchases by a cross section of independents and major operatorsgives a clear picture of the attempts by operators to make sound investmentdecisions in times of economic uncertainty. The data used for the studyare actual evaluations of the properties used by the purchaser in makingthe acquisition decision in the form of engineering reports or othersources, including personal conversations.</TEXT></DOC>
