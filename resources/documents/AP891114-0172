(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA's planned launch of its lastunmanned rocket Saturday will send the first of several satellitesto study how the universe has evolved since its birth in the ``bigbang'' 15 billion years ago, officials said Tuesday.   The new launch date for the $150 million, 4,850-pound CosmicBackground Explorer was announced after space agency engineersfixed a faulty guidance computer on the rocket that will carry thespacecraft into orbit.   ``This is going to begin an explosion of knowledge about theuniverse,'' David Gilman, manager of the $400 million CosmicBackground Explorer program, said during a news conference at thespace agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.   The satellite, the Hubble Space Telescope and three otherobservatories to be placed in Earth orbit during the 1990s ``aregoing to provide us with an unprecedented, unbelievable view of theuniverse,'' program scientist Larry Caroff said.   ``We will see things we haven't even imagined,'' he predicted.``Hold on to your hats because this is going to shake up the worldof science.''   The satellite is scheduled for launch from Vandenberg Air ForceBase on the central California coast during a 30-minute periodstarting at 6:24 a.m. PST Saturday.   The 16-by-28-foot, solar-powered satellite is to be carried intoa 559-mile-high, near-polar orbit by a 116-foot-tall Delta rocket,the last unmanned, expendable rocket to be launched by the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration.   NASA will continue to launch manned shuttles and possiblyunmanned cargo shuttles with reusable boosters. But the Air Forceor private companies will charge NASA to launch any payloads thatrequire unmanned, expendable rockets.   The satellite's launch had been scheduled for Friday, then wasdelayed until Sunday because of a malfunctioning guidance computer.But the computer was replaced so quickly last weekend that thelaunch was moved up to Saturday, said Peter Eaton, a NASA rocketofficial.   The satellite was to have originally been put in orbit by ashuttle, but was diverted to an unmanned rocket after the 1986Challenger disaster.   Once in orbit and after a 30-day shakedown, the satellite willspend up to two years measuring cosmic background radiation, whichmakes up about 2 percent of the static on a television set. Itincludes microwaves, heat and other electromagnetic radiation givenoff by the ``big bang,'' the gargantuan explosion scientistsbelieve created the universe an estimated 15 billion years ago.   ``The radiation we're measuring is actually the remnant of thegreat explosion itself,'' project scientist John Mather said.``We're looking at it as it was a very long time ago. We're seeingthe primary cosmic fossil.''   With the three most sensitive sensors of their types, thesatellite will measure ``the collective glow of all the stars andgalaxies and whatever else has been there since the beginning,''Mather said.   That will help scientists learn more about what happened in thetime between three minutes after the big bang, when the firstatomic nuclei or centers formed, and 500,000 years later, when thefirst atoms formed. It also will search for light from the creationof the first stars and galaxies about 200 million years after theprimeval fireball.   Mather said NASA will share information from the mission withthe Soviet Union, which has flown one similar research mission andplans two others.   A shuttle is scheduled to carry the Hubble Space Telescope intoorbit in March. An optical telescope of unprecedented power, italso may see formation of the earliest galaxies, said NancyBoggess, deputy project scientist on the Cosmic Background Explorerprogram.   That will be followed by the shuttle launches of the Gamma RayObservatory in June and the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility in1997, Gilman said. A private, expendable rocket will launch theSpace Infrared Telescope Facility in 1999, he added.</TEXT></DOC>
