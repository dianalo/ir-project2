Subsequent actions concerningthe conditions of approval and program amendments are identified at 30CFR 935.11, 935.12, 935.15, and 935.16. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Submission of Amendments</ITAG>By letter dated March 8, 1988 (Administrative Record No. OH-1019), theOhio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation (Ohio) submittedProgram Amendment Number 33, which revises Rule 1501:13-4-02 of the OhioAdministrative Code (OAC). On July 1, 1988 (Administrative Record No. OH-1066),Ohio submitted further revisions to OAC 1501:13-4-02(B)(1)(b) and (B)(1)(c).OSMRE announced receipt of the March 8, 1988, proposed amendment in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 11, 1988 (53 FR 11887) and, in the samenotice, opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for apublic hearing on its adequacy. Following receipt of the July 1, 1988,revisions, OSMRE reopened the public comment period for an additional 15days on August 8, 1988 (53 FR 29746). A summary of the comments receivedand their disposition appears in the section of this notice entitled ``Summaryand Disposition of Comments.'' <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Director's Findings</ITAG>Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings concerning Program AmendmentNo. 33. 1. OAC 1501:13-4-02(B)(1)(b) The proposed revision would require that each exploration notice includethe name, address, and telephone number of the individual who will be presentor <T3>or</T3> (rather than ``and'' as in the previous language of this provision)responsible for exploration activities. The corresponding Federal regulation at 30 CFR 772.11(b)(2) contains languageidentical to that of the previous State rule. However, the preamble tothis rule, originally promulgated as 30 CFR 776.11(b), indicates that itsintent was to require information identifying the specific individual,e.g., foreman, corporate agent, or other representative of the applicant,whom the inspector or other representative of the regulatory authoritycould contact directly for inspection, enforcement and other purposes.(See 44 FR 15018, March 13, 1979.) By letter dated June 28, 1988 (Administrative Record No. OH-1066), Ohioexplains that this responsible individual is often not the same person(usually the driller) who is actually present at the exploration site ona continuous basis. There is nothing in the preamble to the Federal ruleto indicate that OSMRE intended to require that the designated contactperson (responsible individual) actually be present on-site at all times.In fact, given the limited nature of much exploration activity, good managementpractices would often dictate otherwise. Furthermore, like 30 CFR 772.11(b)(1),OAC 1501:13-4-02 (B)(1)(a) requires the same identifying information ofthe applicant, who is ultimately responsible for the exploration operation.Therefore, the Director finds that, provided the designated responsibleindividual is readily accessible and can be easily contacted by the personwho is actually present onsite, the proposed change is no less effectivethan the Federal rule. 2. OAC 1501:13-4-02(B)(1)(c) To improve consistency in terminology, Ohio is replacing ``area'' with``site'' when referencing the location of exploration activities. Sincethis is a nonsubstantive wording change, the Director finds that it willnot render the rule less effective than its Federal counterpart at 30 CFR772.11. 3. OAC 1501:13-4-02(C)(1) As revised, this rule would require that the person conducting the explorationoperation give telephone notice on the date of commencement of any explorationactivities to the Ohio Division of Reclamation district office having jurisdictionover the exploration area. The Federal counterpart at 30 CFR 772.11 does not require such notice.However, under 30 CFR 730.5 and 730.11(b), States are not necessarily limitedto the procedures and requirements contained in the Federal rules. Therefore,since the change does not conflict with any Federal requirement, the Directorfinds that the revised rule is no less effective than its Federal counterpart.4. OAC 1501:13-4-02(C)(1)(a) As revised, this rule would allow the Chief to exempt exploratory operationsinvolving only drilling activities from being considered a substantialdisturbance of the land surface unless those activities would affect landsdesignated as unsuitable for coal mining operations. The corresponding Federal rules in 30 CFR Part 772 contain no such exemption.However, as discussed below, it does allow drilling to be considered anonsubstantial disturbance under certain circumstances. The preamble tothe Federal definition of ``substantially disturb'' in 30 CFR 701.5 specifiesthat the determination of whether drilling activities would result in substantialdisturbance must be made either on a case-by-case basis, using the definitionof ``substantially disturb'' as guidance, or through guidelines supplementingthe State program. (See 48 FR 40624, September 8, 1983.) All guidelinesmust be consistent with the definition of ``substantially disturb'' tobe no less effective than the Federal rules. In the June 28, 1988, administrative record accompanying this amendment,Ohio establishes guidelines for use in determining whether a disturbancewould be substantial. These guidelines are vague and lacking in definitivecriteria, but, properly interpreted, they are not inconsistent with theFederal or State definitions. However, Ohio further states in this documentthat it intends to consider the construction of roads to facilitate drillingto be a nonsubstantial disturbance since such roads would only be usedfor a short duration.The Director finds this statement to be inconsistent with the definitionof ``substantially disturb.'' As discussed at length in the preamble tothis definition (48 FR 40624, September 8, 1983), the revised Federal ruledid not intend to categorically exclude drilling operations. Indeed, thepreamble clearly states that ``usually such a substantial disturbance wouldoccur when drilling is combined with other activities (e.g., * * * constructionof roads to a drilling site or the removal of vegetation and topsoil forthe drill pad, in addition to the drilling itself).'' Depending on site-specificenvironmental conditions, these activities may not always result in substantialdisturbance; however, the categorical exclusion intended by Ohio is clearlyinconsistent with the Federal rule. Any exclusion of roads constructedfor drilling operations must be based on their environmental impact, notthe extent to which they are used. Negative environmental impacts of roadsare usually related more to their construction and maintenance than totheir degree of use.The Director agrees with Ohio that drilling is usually the least environmentallydisruptive form of exploration; however, it does not follow, as Ohio implies,that drilling is therefore a nonsubstantial disturbance. Minimization ofenvironmental impacts is desirable and a purpose of SMCRA, but minimizationalone does not justify a determination of no substantial disturbance. Thedecision as to whether a particular activity would create a substantialdisturbance must be based on the absolute impacts which would result fromthat disturbance, not on how those impacts compare with the impacts whichwould be caused if differing methodology were used.Therefore, the Director finds that the rule change itself, which allows,but does not require, Ohio to consider drilling to be a nonsubstantialdisturbance, is no less effective than the Federal rule, provided Ohiointerprets this rule in a manner consistent with this finding.5. OAC 1501:13-4-02(E)(2)This proposed revision provides that notices of intent to explore shallexpire on the first anniversary of the date of issuance unless a requestfor renewal is filed with the Ohio Division of Reclamation at least 60days prior to the expiration date. Although the corresponding Federal ruleat 30 CFR 772.11 does not specify when a notice of intent to explore expires,under 30 CFR 730.5 and 730.11 States may adopt procedures and requirementsin addition to those contained in SMCRA and the Federal rule. Therefore,since the Ohio provision does not conflict with any Federal requirement,the Director finds that the revision is not inconsistent with section 512of SMCRA and will not render the State rule less effective than 30 CFR772.11.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments</ITAG>Public CommentsThe comment period and opportunity to request a hearing announced in theApril 11, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>ended on May 11, 1988. The public comment periodwas reopened in the August 8, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>and ended on August 23, 1988. No public commentswere received and the scheduled public hearing was not held as no one requestedan opportunity to provide testimony.Agency CommentsPursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and the implementing regulations at30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited from various Federal agencieswith an actual or potential interest in the Ohio program. Only the SoilConservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture provided comments,the disposition of which is summarized below:1. <T3>Comment: </T3>The guidelines criterion concerning barren areas, whichstates that the creation of such areas will be minimized, should be revisedto require that areas with slopes greater than two percent be regradedto the original contour and reseeded with a permanent pasture mixture.<T3>Response: </T3>This comment has not been adopted since it would bea performance standard, not a criterion for determining whether a proposedactivity would constitute a substantial disturbance, which is the purposeof the guidelines.2. <T3>Comment: </T3>Erosion during and after construction of roads for accessby drilling equipment may be a major disturbance.<T3>Response: </T3>The Director agrees. As discussed in Finding 4, he isrequiring the State to determine whether road construction would constitutea substantial disturbance on the basis of actual and potential environmentalimpact, rather than the extent to which the road would be used, as originallyproposed.3. <T3>Comment: </T3>OAC 1501: 13-4-02(B)(1)(h) should be revised to allowthe notice of intent to explore to include either a statement that theexploration operations will not substantially disturb the ground surfaceor a plan to reclaim significant disturbances, rather than just the formeras is currently required.<T3>Response: </T3>The commenter's suggestion would impermissably weakenthis rule by allowing persons to substantially disturb the land's surfacewithout first obtaining an exploration permit. Therefore, it has not beenadopted.4. <T3>Comment: </T3>Drill holes created by coal exploration should be sealedafter drilling so as to protect aquifers and prevent future dumping ofwaste materials.<T3>Response: </T3>The Ohio program already contains this provision. OAC1501: 13-4-02(E)(2) and 13-8-01(G) require that all coal exploration operationscomply with the requirements of OAC 1501: 13-9-02, which requires thateach hole drilled be cased, sealed, or otherwise managed as approved bythe Chief to prevent acid or other toxic drainage from entering groundor surface waters.5. <T3>Comment: </T3>Any slurry or brine created from exploration drillingshould be contained in the immediate area and/or removed from the siteand disposed of in an approved manner.<T3>Response: </T3>Neither the State nor the Federal rules include thisstandard. However, both do require compliance with all State and Federalrequirements concerning water quality, which should achieve the resultdesired by the commenter. Also, OAC 1501: 13-4-02(B)(1)(g) requires thatnotices of intent include a description of the practices to be followedto reclaim the area and to prevent adverse environmental impacts, and OAC1501: 13-8-01(I) requires that coal exploration operations be conductedin a manner which minimizes disturbance of the prevailing hydrologic balancein accordance with OAC 1501: 13-9-04.6. <T3>Comment: </T3>Where a substantial disturbance determination has beenmade, a plan to control erosion, establish permanent vegetation and preservewater quality should be prepared.<T3>Response: </T3>OAC 1501: 13-4-02(B)(2)(a) already contains this requirement.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Director's Decision</ITAG>Based on the findings discussed above, the Director is approving ProgramAmendment Number 33 as submitted on March 8 and July 1, 1988, with thepartial exception of the revision of OAC 1501: 13-4-02(C)(1)(a) as discussedin Finding 4. As provided by 30 CFR 732.17 (a) and (g), any provisionsthat are not approved by the Director may not be implemented as part ofthe Ohio program.This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the Stateprogram amendment process and to encourage States to conform their programswith the Federal standards without delay. Consistency of State and Federalstandards is required by SMCRA.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Procedural Determinations</ITAG>National Environmental Policy ActThe Secretary has determined that, pursuant to section 702(d) of SMCRA,30 U.S.C. 1292(d), no environmental impact statement need to be preparedon this rulemaking. Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility ActOn July 12, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted OSMREan exemption from Sections 3, 4, and 7, and 8 of Executive Order 12291for actions directly related to approval or conditional approval of Stateregulatory programs. Therefore, this action is exempt from preparationof a regulatory impact analysis and regulatory review by OMB.The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not havea significant effect on a substantial number of small entities under theRegulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This rule will not impose any new requirements; rather,it will ensure that existing requirements established by SMCRA and theFederal rules will be met by the State.Paperwork Reduction ActThis rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subject in 30 CFR Part 935</ITAG>Coal mining, Intergovernmental relations, Surface mining, Underground mining.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: January 23, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
