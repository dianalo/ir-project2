The Phoenix-based company's board of directors announced thedecision on Wednesday, reacting to a recommendation from aboard-appointed advisory committee.   Several parties had expressed interest in acquiring the company,but no proposals were received by the bidding deadline, Circle Ksaid in a prepared release.   The board was told by Wasserstein Perella andamp; Co. Inc., hired inFebruary as financial advisors to the committee, that a successfulleveraged transaction wasn't likely under current market andoperating conditions.   The firm noted that an unsuccessful attempt might have an adverseaffect on the company.   The board cited a weak securities market and the thin operatingmargins of convenience stores as reasons for its decision to stopseeking acquisition proposals. It also decided against a financialrestructuring and instructed management to devote its efforts tostrengthening and improving the company's existing operations.   Circle K already has disposed of most of its non-store-relatedbusinesses and currently owns only about 12 percent of its 4,680stores. The rest have been sold or leased back.   Aggressive expansion had left Circle K with a heavy debt load.Circle K in June reported a $23.1 million fourth-quarter loss onrevenue of $931.2 million.   The board on Wednesday also set Oct. 16 as the record date forthe annual shareholders' meeting to be held on Nov. 21 and decidednot to declare a dividend on the company's common stock for thecurrent quarter. It did declare a $2 per share dividend on certainshares of a preferred stock payable on Sept. 28, company officialssaid.   ``It is my understanding that there is no comment being made,''on the board's actions, said Bonnie Briglia, Circle K chairman KarlEller's personal secretary, when Eller was called for comment.   Eller indicated interest in May in a leveraged buyout. In aleveraged buyout the acquisition is financed through high yieldingbonds, or loans that are repaid with earnings or by a sale of assets.   At that time, analysts speculated that Eller's interest wasintended to spur a sense of urgency among possible outside buyers.</TEXT></DOC>
