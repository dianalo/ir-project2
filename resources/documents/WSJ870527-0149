The cuts average about 13% and follow several rate decreases earlier this year.    The telecommunications concern said the request is part of its effort to move toward market-based, competitive pricing and to move its customers toward long-term commitments. Comsat said it is able to make such reductions because of an unexpected increase this year in demand for satellite services, particularly in voice-grade service and the unit's International Business Satellite Service.    The reduction requests include the voice-grade service, International Business Satellite and full-time video. They also include a new nine-year long-term rate that will provide as much as a 30% discount on voice-grade services.    Comsat asked to make the reductions effective in 45 days, but it hopes to accelerate the effective date once the 15-day comment period has expired. </TEXT></DOC>
