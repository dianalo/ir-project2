(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL's trustee says he has asked that Jimand Tammy Bakker curtail their increasingly frequent visits toHeritage USA.   ``They're not creating a big disturbance, but it's sort of anirritant,'' M.C. Benton said Tuesday.   The trustee said he was told that Tammy Bakker and a member ofthe band of the ``PTL Today'' show recently got into an argument infront of the studio audience minutes after the program ended.   ``I got a report that she had been particularly abusive,''Benton said. ``So I just said, `That's enough. I've got enoughother problems without having to worry about them.'''   Benton said PTL lawyers asked the Bakkers, through the couple'sattorneys, to restrict themselves voluntarily to residential areasat Heritage USA, the Christian theme park run by the evangelicalempire built by Bakker.   ``Mr. Bakker's father and mother live there and I didn't want toshut him out of visiting them,'' said Benton, who was appointed byU.S. Bankruptcy Court in May to oversee the sale of Heritage USAproperty to pay PTL creditors.   Bakker attorney Jim Toms said Benton had not communicated thosewishes either to him or to Bakker's other lawyer, Ryan Hovis.   ``I'm astonished to hear such a thing,'' Toms said. ``Therecertainly has been no breach of the peace, and when he's thefounder of the ministry and has a substantial constituency there,I'm astonished that Mr. Benton would prohibit him from going on theproperty.   The Bakkers moved to the Lake Wylie area in June after nearly ayear in exile in Tennessee and California. Bakker resigned from PTLin 1987 in a sex and money scandal but has been trying ever sinceto return.   In the past month, the Bakkers announced their intentions to buyHeritage USA and return as its leaders.   Benton is considering several offers to buy PTL, including onefrom Bakker, and is to report his recommendation to BankruptcyJudge Rufus Reynolds in August.</TEXT></DOC>
