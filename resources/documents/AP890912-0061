Two other men who refused to admit their guilt were given lifesentences in a group trial in a city gymnasium that was aired onnational television and reported in detail in the Beijing Daily.   More than 2,400 people, including Beijing's Communist Party chiefand Politburo member Li Ximing, attended the sentencing.   Last week, in a similar trial, seven people who allegedly stoleweapons from troops during the June 3-4 military attack onpro-democracy demonstrators were given jail terms of up to 13 years.Another seven who turned themselves in were let go.   The government has promised leniency to all student activistswanted by police for their activities during the pro-democracymovement. It has issued a similar promise during its currentcampaign against corruption, a major issue raised by students duringthe protest movement.   Those who refuse to admit their crimes or give themselves up arebeing threatened with harsh punishment.   In the corruption cases, Wu Keqiang, vice director of a leatherfactory, was accused of illegally trading in steel, other metals andimitation leather in deals worth $92,700 between 1981 and 1987.   He was also charged with bribing factory managers with televisionsets, refrigerators, tape recorders, cameras, electric fans,watches, washing machines motorcycles and bicycles worth $9,000 toset up his black market transactions.   He was sentenced to death and executed immediately after themeeting, the report said.   Also sentenced to die was Shen Xiaoping, 31, a purchasing agentfor an electronics company, who was charged with stealing $105,000by using fake receipts. The report did not say if the sentence wascarried out.   Wang Huaiyin, manager of a construction materials plant, shouldhave been sentenced to death for embezzlement and accepting bribes,the Beijing Daily said. But because he gave himself up to policelast February, he was allowed to go free.   The court also set free three others said to have voluntarilyconfessed their crimes.   In a separate report, the Beijing daily said citizens have turnedin six submachine guns, three pistols and 644 bullets in the past 10days. That followed a call by security forces for citizens to giveup weapons seized during the June military drive to recaptureTiananmen Square from pro-democracy demonstrators.   In another development, the Chinese government is erecting itsown statue on approximately the same spot on Tiananmen Square wherestudent demonstrators raised the ``Goddess of Democracy'' that wasto become a symbol of their movement.   The 26-foot-high statue of a worker, peasant, soldier andintellectual will be completed before Oct. 1 National Daycelebrations, the official Xinhua News Agency said.   The report said the statue will be located about 105 feet southof the national flag pole at the northern end of the square.   The 33-foot high Goddess of Democracy, fashioned from whiteplastic foam by eight Beijing art schools, was unveiled on about thesame spot on May 30. It was destroyed when military tanks invadedthe northern end of the square on June 4.   The student statue, modeled after the Statue of Liberty, incensedthe Chinese authorities, who said it was an ``insult to the nationalimage and dignity.''</TEXT></DOC>
