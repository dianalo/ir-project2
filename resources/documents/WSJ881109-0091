Soaring buy-out prices, highlighted by the record bidding for RJR Nabisco Inc., are cited most frequently by pension funds, insurance companies and endowments as the reason for curbing new commitments to leveraged buy-out funds.    But many institutional investors say their pricing concerns were building even before the three-week-old battle for RJR, and are linked to more general fears about a possible recession that could lead to defaults by highly leveraged companies.    &quot;We really have pulled in our horns in the last few months or so,&quot; says Kipp Koester, who oversees $200 million in LBO fund investments for Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., Milwaukee. &quot;Unlike the stock market, the prices of LBOs have escalated to multiples higher today than they were before&quot; the October 1987 stock market crash, he adds.    Money invested by pension funds and other institutions in leveraged buy-out funds has fueled the current surge in megadeals, including bids of more than $20 billion for RJR. With about $25 billion already pledged to leveraged buy-out funds, there isn't any shortage of money to keep the current buy-out binge going -- because takeovers totaling an estimated $250 billion could be financed by those commitments using borrowed money.    But future funding might not be so easy to come by if institutions pull back from further equity investments in leveraged buy-outs. Moreover, Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, and other banking regulators, have been expressing concern about massive bank lending for leveraged buy-outs.    &quot;There are more people that are nervous today because of the RJR Nabisco transaction, and I don't particularly blame them,&quot; says Martin Dubilier, chairman of the buy-out firm of Clayton andamp; Dubilier Inc. He adds that huge breakup transactions, in which a takeover target is broken up and its parts sold, could result in a backlash against all buy-outs, many of which don't include such asset sales.    For the moment, institutional investors are almost unanimous in saying they will honor existing commitments to buy-out funds, as called for under their partnership agreements with fund sponsors. Under those accords, the limited partners, which typically provide 80% of the equity financing in leveraged buy-outs, hold on to their money until the general partner needs it to proceed with a takeover.    As a result, decisions by institutional investors to curb further funding of leveraged buy-outs wouldn't affect buy-out funds with commitments in hand, such as the $5.6 billion raised by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., which is bidding for RJR. Nor would it affect smaller funds organized by Forstmann Little andamp; Co., which is weighing an RJR bid, or Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which joined with RJR management in making the first bid for the Atlanta-based tobacco and food company.    A KKR spokesman says that any curtailment in leveraged buy-out investing by institutions &quot;doesn't faze us and wouldn't surprise us.&quot; He says that many big investors already have made large commitments to LBOs, and that some may be concerned about the heightened controversy surounding them because of the RJR bidding. But he adds: &quot;We've turned away equity investors that want to be part of this deal.&quot;    David Weig, executive director of the Washington State Investment Board, which has about $500 million in leveraged buy-out commitments, says that pension fund decided several months ago against expanding its LBO investments. While voicing confidence in the sponsors of the leveraged buy-out funds in which the state invests, he worries about pressures on them to launch takeovers, regardless of whether a deal is safe. &quot;Every additional deal adds another brick to the boat,&quot; he says.    The state of Michigan pension system, with about $300 million currently committed to leveraged buy-out funds, has been &quot;very concerned across the board about pricing&quot; of takeovers, according to Paul E. Rice, head of the system's LBO investing. &quot;We're taking a breather to evaluate what's happening in the marketplace,&quot; he says, adding: &quot;We'll see what washes out six months from now, or maybe longer.&quot;    Concerns about the skyrocketing prices for leveraged buy-outs have been widespread even among takeover specialists themselves. A survey of 100 leveraged buy-out firms recently found &quot;high market multiples&quot; as the biggest problem affecting their business, according to executive recruiter Russell Reynolds Associates Inc.    The leveraged buy-out firm of McCown Deleeuw andamp; Co., for example, says that when Del Webb Corp. put up for sale its Bullfrog Marina and a group of other recreational businesses this year, McCown was ready to leap at the opportunity. But it wasn't willing to jump high enough: In September, ARA Services Inc. won the properties for $77 million, 25% above McCown's top-dollar offer.    &quot;That's a reflection of our unwillingness to do deals at these prices,&quot; says George McCown, co-founder of the firm that has completed seven leveraged buy-outs since 1985. &quot;I guess we don't understand how people get the numbers to work at these levels when we can't, and we think we're pretty good at it,&quot; he says.    Some investors have concerns other than pricing. The Common Fund, an endowment that handles investments for hundreds of universities, says it is proceeding with plans for a $100 million leveraged buy-out fund; the money would be invested with a group of LBO firms. But the Common Fund wants the universities to be able to pull back their unused commitments of funds if the tax-law changes are imposed to discourage leveraged buy-outs, which make heavy use of tax-deductible interest payments in their financing.    &quot;This is a significant risk,&quot; says George Keane, Common Fund president. He adds that he &quot;wouldn't be at all surprised&quot; if Congress made changes that could &quot;really kill or seriously impair this whole area.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
