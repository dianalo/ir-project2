Sees New Software as Key to Business World</HEAD><BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Steve Jobs, pitching Next Inc.'s priceyworkstation to the business world, recalled the first time he saw acomputer spreadsheet.   It was 1977, and one of the creators of the spreadsheet wasshowing it off at Apple Computer Inc., the Cupertino companyco-founded by Jobs.   ``Somebody was ushering him through, saying it's the mostincredible thing we've seen in software,'' Jobs remembered. ``Wehardly knew how to spell software back then. It was this visualcalculator and they were trying to decide what to call it.''   The name chosen was Visicalc, and the product turned the AppleII, co-invented by Jobs, into a practical business computer and ahuge success.   ``That was the first education we got as to how important thesethings were going to become in our lives,'' Jobs said. ``Any of uswho went through that experience never forgot how much a spreadsheetshapes the future of the computer. We saw the same thing withMacintosh.''   Jobs, who left Apple after a dispute, believes his new company,Next Inc., will have even greater success cracking the businessmarket after the introduction Tuesday of the versatile Wingz graphicspreadsheet from Informix Software Inc. and completion of Next's 1.0operating system.   Next recently began shipping its sleek, black $9,995 workstation,and demand is picking up rapidly, said David A. Norman, chiefexecutive officer for Businessland, Next's U.S. distributor. Normansaid he is sticking by his estimate that Next will account for $100million in sales within 12 months.   ``We have sold hundreds of (Next) machines into the corporatemarketplace and we need to sell thousands,'' said Norman. ``What weneeded was, one, an operating system, and two, real applications.Today marks the beginning of real applications.''   Jobs said Next's heavily automated plant in Fremont is ready tospeed up quickly for high-volume shipments to match Norman's salesexpectations.   ``It has a large enough capacity to support a $1 billioncompany,'' Jobs said. ``We have ambitious goals. I think we'vepassed some real significant milestones. But I think we have a lotof work left to do.''   Jobs said that when Apple developed the Macintosh under hisdirection, ``we kind of went into corporate America through the backdoor. We weren't really accepted in the front door.''   The Next machine, though, was designed to meet the needs ofbusinesses that want to develop their own software quickly andefficiently and use it on an easily operated and reliableworkstation.   ``Next is coming in the front door now,'' Norman said. ``We'regetting the heads of management information systems to see thisproduct and take the factory tour. It's a lot easier for us to getthe products evaluated and get on the approved lists so people canbuy the products.''   Part of Jobs' ambitious plans are tied to a software developmentrelationship with International Business Machines Corp. _ a companyhe once disparaged in ads as ``Big Brother.''   IBM's interest in Next stems from the usefulness of NextStep inspeeding software development and the desire by IBM to get softwarefor its workstations into the marketplace quickly.   The two companies struck a deal giving IBM the right to evaluateNextStep and establish royalty rates and contingency payments if IBMdecides to offer it.   NextStep, which programmers say allows up to 33 percent fasterdevelopment of software, was used by Informix to create its Wingzversion for Next. NextStep is a layer of software that sits betweenthe operating system, which controls the inside of the computer, andthe application programs, such as word processors and spreadsheets.   If the Next-IBM relationship proves successful, it could mean bigtrouble for software leader and longstanding IBM partner MicrosoftCorp., and workstation manufacturers Sun Microsystems Inc., DigitalEquipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Corp.   ``Jobs' wooing of IBM is just the opening skirmish in what hasbecome a sordid battle for intellectual leadership of theindustry,'' says Stewart Alsop, editor of P.C. Letter.   Jobs is working with more than 70 software companies, includingLotus Development Corp., encouraging them to ``do to Microsoft withthe Next computer what Microsoft did to them with the Macintosh.''   Microsoft gained its preeminence in the industry by developingsoftware for IBM and then capturing nearly the entire businessapplication market for the Macintosh.   Jobs, who seeded Next with $7 million of his own money in 1985after he left Apple, owns 50 percent of the company, which has atotal valuation of $600 million.   Canon Inc. of Japan, which invested $100 million in Next earlierthis year, owns 16.67 percent of the company, and the Perot Group,headed by investor Ross Perot, owns 12.51 percent. Next employeesown 20 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
