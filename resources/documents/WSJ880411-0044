He isn't likely to get it. In fact, the counsel, Gerald Ducharme, worries that the European Community's big overhaul of merger matters, part of the EC campaign to remove internal trade barriers by 1992, will do little more than lengthen the long line of bureaucrats Ford already must negotiate with. &quot;You want a one-stop&quot; process to replace the 12 national ones controlling takeovers in Europe, he says. &quot;Unfortunately, the proposed regulations won't do that.&quot;    Across Europe, laws governing takeovers and mergers are a hodgepodge of domestic statutes, court-made precedent and local politics. EC Competition Commissioner Peter Sutherland calls the current system of national controls &quot;totally unreal.&quot;    That is supposed to change by 1992. Under its proposals, the EC would review any acquisition within the Common Market involving a company with annual sales exceeding 50 million European currency units ($62.5 million) and any combination of companies with total revenue of one billion ECUs ($1.25 billion). It would have to decide within two months if there are grounds for a further, four-month antitrust investigation. Combinations deemed to restrict competition would be stopped.    Among the proposals, a major benefit to U.S. companies is one to restrict governments from favoring domestic bidders. In any country, the EC could block a combination of companies that earns 25% of revenue outside home territory. Thus, in a U.K. bid, Jaguar PLC would face the same regulatory hurdles as Ford.    But businessmen say the thresholds mean many mergers will be subject to costly, time-consuming reviews. Worse, if it isn't politically tough enough, the EC can decide to leave important decisions to national governments.    &quot;It can tie you up for six months, then throw you back to the wolves&quot; -- the national authorities -- says Ford's Mr. Ducharme. &quot;With that in mind, I am not too impressed.&quot;    Nevertheless, the rules are intended to bring order to chaos. In Europe's current wave of takeovers, raiders look across borders, but the referees -- each with its own set of rules -- don't. European industry is being shaped in a policy vacuum, creating the potential for abuse of shareholders and consumers alike. Says Detloff von Winterfeld, general counsel for Colgate-Palmolive Co.'s West German unit: &quot;We talk about a Common Market, but for that to happen it is absolutely indispensible that mergers and acquisitions be looked at from a European Community point of view.&quot;    An EC official admits the proposals &quot;may be imperfect,&quot; but promises that industry's biggest nightmare won't materialize: The EC won't defer controversial cases to national governments, he says. &quot;If a merger has a substantial impact on the competitive structure of the Common Market, we will prohibit or authorize it, and that's the end of it.&quot;    The proposal would change the takeover game most in Italy, Belgium, Denmark and Spain, none of which has tough merger-control laws, giving buyers almost free rein. Resistance to change is strongest in France and Britain, which are leery of losing sovereign powers.    The EC proposals have plenty of holes. Nothing is said about takeover tactics, leaving intact scrambled national laws. The differences are widening as governments hustle to regulate raiders.    The differences can mean winning or losing. Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti couldn't have surprised Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. with his 18.6% shareholding if the company were based in France or Denmark. Not only are disclosure rules stiffer in those countries, but each has tougher restrictions on bids by foreign investors. Mr. De Benedetti knows the rules well. France used them to block his 1986 bid for auto-parts maker Valeo S.A.    After nine years under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Britain is widely viewed as the freest market in Europe. But to protect the small investors at the heart of Thatcherism, Britain has some of the toughest takeover restrictions anywhere. Investors can't buy more than 30% of a company without making a bid for the remainder, and must offer the same price to all holders. In Britain, once Mr. De Benedetti accumulated a 47.01% Societe Generale stake with his allies, he couldn't have doubled his bidding price for the next 7% he wanted. The differences would have effectively killed the bid, lawyers say.    On the other hand, companies in Belgium, the Netherlands and elsewhere have defensive weapons few British companies do. Takeover targets can issue new shares to dilute an attack. Anonymous bearer shares make it hard to find major shareholders. The absence of &quot;squeeze-out&quot; provisions, which allow a controlling holder to buy minority stakes, means bids are more likely to end in stalemate.    Then there are differences in how corporate directors are required to act. In Britain, directors' legal duty is to shareholders; Dutch law obligates directors to protect the company's interest, including employees, customers and creditors. Dutch law is so hostile to unfriendly bids that none has succeeded there since 1960.    Antitrust cases provide the widest differences. Germany and Britain investigate if proposed mergers restrict competition, and often block them. Britain studies, and can prevent, combinations holding a 20% share of any domestic market.    Other countries encourage the creation of strong domestic groups. Italy and Denmark don't have general antitrust law. So the Ferruzzi-Montedison group has 38% of the Italian sugar market, and last year's combination of Fiat S.p.A. and Alfa Romeo S.p.A. has 63% of the auto market.    Germany and the Netherlands have nurtured some of Europe's biggest conglomerates by ejecting predators on national-interest grounds. Some people fear the EC rules would permit those powerful companies to go on a buying spree. Ironically, nations with tough antitrust laws, by blocking mergers to create more powerful domestic groups, may have left local companies vulnerable.    The EC says its purpose is to make European industry more competitive. The rules &quot;override national interests that may be detrimental to EC competition on the whole,&quot; says Mr. Sutherland, the competition commissioner. &quot;The regulations will allow us to intervene to stop national governments from banning mergers&quot; on protectionist grounds.    Whether the rules will promote competition among companies within Europe, or create a few European giants better able to take on Japanese and U.S. rivals, won't be clear for some time. The EC appears to want giants in some industries. It supports an Airbus Industrie big enough to compete against Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. But it seems to prefer several strong auto companies that can compete within Europe as well as outside. </TEXT></DOC>
