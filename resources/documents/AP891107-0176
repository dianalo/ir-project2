(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A propelling charge exploded during artillerytesting at the Yuma Proving Ground, killing two Israeli soldiersinside a tanklike vehicle, U.S. Army officials said Tuesday.   An Israeli team of four soldiers was test firing the modifiedself-propelled M-109 howitzer at the desert base when the accidentoccurred Monday afternoon, Army Capt. Stephen McGeorge said.   The Israeli Defense Force in Jerusalem said the soldiers wereworking on a joint project with the U.S. Army.   Two Israeli soldiers outside the howitzer were injured. They werein satisfactory condition at Yuma Regional Medical Center, the basepublic affairs office said. The identities of the soldiers werewithheld pending notification of relatives.   McGeorge said the propelling charge apparently exploded; theprojectile and fuse were not explosive.   ``The fuse and projectile were filled with sand. They were notexplosive. The shell was an iron body filled with sand and the fusewas inert,'' McGeorge said. He said the shell-fuse combinationweighed about 100 pounds.   McGeorge said the soldiers had fired about 70 of the 100 roundsthey were scheduled to fire Monday. ``These guys were firingintermittently over the course of an eight-hour day,'' he said.   The Israeli army said the accident involved an artillery piecebeing jointly produced by the United States and Israel. Countriesbuying U.S. equipment sometimes test the equipment at U.S.facilities, U.S. officials said.   The proving ground is in Arizona's southwestern corner, near theCalifornia line. The site of the accident was sealed off pendinginvestigation.   McGeorge declined to discuss which country was responsible formaintaining the artillery. ``That will be part of theinvestigation,'' he said.   Because the howitzer was a prototype, investigators will have``far more detailed'' records on its parts and maintenance, than ifthe accident had happened in the field, McGeorge said.   The howitzer was severly damaged, McGeorge said.   He didn't know its cost and declined to discuss the specificmodifications.   The Yuma Daily Sun reported Jan. 3 that Israeli soldiers weretesting an M-109 equipped with computerized fire control andnavigation systems. The systems would allow the self-propelledhowitzer to automatically point its cannon at a target while keepingconstant track of its own location, the Sun said.   The Sun also reported officials planned to increase thehowitzer's firing speed to three rounds every 15 seconds from fourrounds a minute by installing a new loading device that would insertthe howitzer's 100-pound shell into the breech automatically.   McGeorge said the howitzer may have been equipped with thedevice, called a flick rammer, ``but they were not trying for anyspeed records.''</TEXT></DOC>
