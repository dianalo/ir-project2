Newsbytes requestedinformation from 50 Byte advertisers and received 17 replies, or one third,in response.andP;  Only one, however, from BIX (Byte Information Exchange), wascustomized to fit our local Moscow needs.andP;  All the rest were the samematerials sent in States or in Europe.andM;(Kirill Tchashchin/19900601)</TEXT></DOC>
