At present, about 100 million tons of dirt are producedper year, 1,300 million tons are deposited, occupying an area of morethan 6,700 hectares. China pays more attention to the comprehensive utilizationof dirt and land reclamation. The utilization of dirt includes the recoveryof low quality coal, increasing the width and height of the foundationsof roadways and railway lines subjected to subsidence arising from coalmining, making bricks with dirt, the recovery of pyrite and the productionof coal needed by fluid-bed furnaces. Land reclamation with dirt mainlyrefers to filling subsidence pits nearby the shaft mouth, which is, afterbeing treated and strengthened, used as construction site or foundationsfor villages. For this reason, tests on the loads of foundations madeof dirt in part of the areas have been carried out to determine theirbearing loads. The subsidence pits in other areas, after being filledwith dirt, were reclaimed as farm land and planted with trees, or thesubsidence pits accumulated with water have been built into artificiallakes.</TEXT></DOC>
