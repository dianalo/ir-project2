A light signal is passed into one end of the opticalfibre. Any physical movement of the structure, or sectional movementsalong the optical fibre path, such as deflection, bending, displacement(changes in linear uniformity) or fracture of the structure will necessarilyaffect the optical fibre. As a consequence, detectable changes will occurin the electro-optic signature (for measurements made at the input endof the optical fibre) or in the light signal transmission (for measurementsmade at the opposite end of the optical fibre). Such measurements canbe periodically or continuously made to determine the magnitude and locationof physical movement of the structure. In addition, by utilizing additionaloptical fibres, the direction of such physical movement can be determined.The optical fibre itself can be used as a communication link for thetransmission of data and voice.</TEXT></DOC>
