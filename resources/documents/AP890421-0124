Afghan soldiers returned fire, launching a barrage of missilesinto the mountains east of Kabul.   The exchange of fire continued for about two hours. It was thebiggest strike on the capital since April 15, when 11 rockets werefired, killing at least three people.   The guerrillas, known as the mujahedeen or Islamic holywarriors, are waging a war to oust the pro-Soviet government. Therebels are supported by Pakistan, the United States, Saudi Arabiaand China.   Rebel rockets struck the Soviet Embassy on Thursday, shatteringwindows but causing no casualties, according to Soviet diplomatswho spoke on condition of anonymity. They said they did not believethe strike, from about 20 miles northwest of the capital, wasdeliberate.   The United States closed its embassy in Kabul before Soviettroops completed their withdrawal Feb. 15. Since then, Mosleminsurgents have attacked Kabul intermittently but have concentratedtheir firepower on the strategic eastern city of Jalalabad.   Radio Kabul, monitored in Pakistan, reported Thursday that rebelrocket attacks on Jalalabad had killed two people. The guerrillasreportedly were blasting the city from key positions to the southand east, said Radio Kabul. The radio also said four people werehurt Thursday when rockets landed in Kabul.   Jalalabad's fall would be considered a major victory for therebels. It would be the biggest city they have captured and wouldbe a major blow to the morale of the government. Western observersalso have predicted a domino effect, ending with the capital ofKabul.   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to back thegovernment and withdrew the last of their troops in February undera U.N.-mediated accord.</TEXT></DOC>
