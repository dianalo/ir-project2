Emshwiller and Kathleen A. Hughes@  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal </HL><DD> 09/05/89 </DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO><CO> LIVE CRC </CO><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Live Entertainment Inc.'s choice of a law firm to investigate whether there was any link between Live's operations and the recent murder of its chairman has drawn conflict-of-interest charges from a former client of the firm.    The propriety of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrison doing an &quot;internal review&quot; of Live's operations was challenged by Morris Levy, a record-industry executive who federal officials have said has ties to organized crime. The New York firm represented Mr. Levy in his unsuccessful defense of extortion charges in a New Jersey federal court last year.    Earlier this year, Live bought Strawberries, a New England record-store chain in which Mr. Levy held a majority interest, for $40.5 million. Since the Aug. 20 murder of Live's chairman, Jose Menendez, and his wife, Kitty, press attention has focused on the Strawberries purchase as well as a second acquisition by Live from another person with alleged organized-crime ties.    In an interview, Mr. Levy, who has consistently denied any links to organized crime, said his attorney sent a letter to Paul Weiss charging that &quot;a conflict of interest exists if Paul Weiss represents the interests of Live Entertainment in connection with an in-house investigation into Mr. Levy's former company.&quot;    Paul Weiss no longer represents Mr. Levy, and the firm has sued him in New York state court over $1.3 million in legal fees the firm claims it is owed from the extortion case. Mr. Levy, who is free pending appeal of his conviction, contends Paul Weiss overcharged him and gave him inadequate representation.    Peter Hoffman, acting chairman of Live, denied any conflict of interest because Paul Weiss no longer represents Mr. Levy. Mr. Hoffman also said company officials are &quot;extremely confident&quot; there isn't any connection between the Strawberries purchase and Mr. Menendez's murder.    However, Mr. Hoffman conceded that &quot;if for some God-awful reason&quot; a connection is found, &quot;we will review the situation and likely won't have Paul Weiss involved in anything having to do with Mr. Levy.&quot;    Mr. Hoffman is also president and chief executive officer of Carolco Pictures Inc, which finances, produces and leases movies. Carolco owns 49% of Live, a major distributor and retailer of audio and video entertainment.    Mr. Hoffman said Paul Weiss was chosen partly because the firm &quot;has done a lot of work for us in the past.&quot; However, he said &quot;I can't recall&quot; when asked whether that work included the review Live said it had done of possible organized-crime connections at Strawberries at the time of the purchase. Live has said that review found the record chain to be &quot;whistle clean.&quot;    Richard Borisoff, a Paul Weiss partner, refused to answer any questions about the matter.    Allegations concerning Mr. Levy's past have fueled questions about organized crime in the Menendez case. A Federal Bureau of Investigation affidavit filed in New York federal court identifies Mr. Levy as a longtime &quot;lucrative source of cash and property for leaders of the Genovese&quot; crime family. The affidavit also quotes an unidentified informant as saying that Strawberries was partly owned by a faction of the Genovese family.    Mr. Levy said his dealings with Live over Strawberries were amicable. Despite speculation to the contrary, Mr. Levy says he was &quot;thrilled&quot; with the price he received for the company. He said he met Mr. Menendez twice during negotiations. Mr. Levy said his relations with Live officials &quot;have been very friendly. There is no bad blood.&quot;    A second purchase has also raised organized-crime questions. In a series of transactions beginning in 1986, Carolco purchased International Video Entertainment Inc. from Noel C. Bloom, a Los Angeles businessman. Mr. Bloom was identified in a 1986 report on organized crime by the California attorney general's office as a &quot;major distributor of X-rated movies&quot; and a &quot;former associate of the late Michael Zaffarano of the Bonnanno&quot; organized-crime family. The report also said Mr. Bloom is thought to have received his start in the pornography industry with financial help from another figure connected to organized crime.    Mr. Bloom has refused to comment. However, an attorney for him has described Mr. Bloom as a &quot;reputable&quot; video distributor.    International Video was later merged with another company to form Live Entertainment. </TEXT></DOC>
