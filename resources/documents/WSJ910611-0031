Keating Jr., the former chairman ofAmerican Continental Corp., and three associates.   Judge Lance Ito threw out the counts on the ground ofinsufficient evidence and raised the possibility that theremaining 21 counts might be dismissed at another hearingscheduled for June 28.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We don't think that's likely,&quot; said Sandi Gibbons, aspokeswoman for the district attorney's office.   Mr. Keating and his associates are charged with makingfalse statements and other securities violations inconnection with the sale of more than $250 million ofAmerican Continental unsecured debentures.   American Continental was the parent of Irvine,Calif.-based Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association until thethrift was seized by regulators in April 1989. Mr. Keating, avocal critic of thrift regulation, has become a symbol of thenation's Sandamp;L crisis.   Judge Ito's action wasn't unexpected. In January, he threwout 12 fraud counts against the thrift executives. He citedtechnical problems with some of the prosecution's charges anddismissed the others as &quot;internally inconsistent.&quot; He said itwas possible that more counts would be dismissed at Friday'shearing. A trial has been set for Aug. 2.</TEXT></DOC>
