The release is expected to bolster President Yoweri Museveni'sefforts to organize peace talks with rebel armies fighting hisgovernment in the north and east, Western analysts told TheAssociated Press.   The Internal Affairs Ministry said Museveni had ordered that1,671 prisoners of war be discharged from prisons.   Most of the prisoners were fighting for the Uganda People'sDemocratic Movement, a northern-based guerrilla force. They wereheld without charge after being captured in clashes with governmenttroops.   Museveni evidently ordered their release as a concession toguerrilla leaders with whom government envoys have made contact ina bid for peace in Uganda. The country that has been convulsed bycivil conflicts almost constantly since its independence fromBritain on Oct. 9, 1962.   Museveni seized power in January 1986, ending a five-year waragainst civilian president Milton Obote and the military junta thatousted Obote in July 1985. Museveni formed a government of nationalunity, inviting four other rival parties to join his cabinet.   In September and October 1986 soldiers arrested several men ontreason charges of plotting a coup. Courts have released most ofthe men for lack of evidence.   Soldiers loyal to Obote and other toppled Ugandan leaders,including former military dictator Idi Amin, have mounted guerrillaoperations against Museveni's government since August 1986.   Amin lives in exile in Saudi Arabia and Obote in Britain.</TEXT></DOC>
