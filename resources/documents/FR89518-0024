One of the several subjects discussed in the ANPRM concerned thesafe evacuation of personnel from manned OCS facilities under emergencyconditions. On December 24, 1987, the Coast Guard published a Notice ofProposed Rulemaking (NPRM) (52 FR 48717) entitled ``Emergency EvacuationPlans for Manned OCS Facilities'' (CGD 84-098b). The NPRM proposed regulationsthat would require a comprehensive, site specific contingency plan forthe emergency evacuation of all personnel from manned OCS facilities. TheNPRM did not propose the mandatory use of standby vessels but did proposespecific standards for standby vessels if they were designated in the EmergencyEvacuation Plan (EEP) as an integral part of the plan. The comment period for the NPRM originally closed on January 25, 1988,but was extended until February 25, 1988, in response to public requests(53 FR 2236; January 27, 1988). Forty two comment letters were received.A public hearing was not requested. On March 29, 1988, the Subcommittee on the Panama Canal and Outer ContinentalShelf of the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Merchant Marineand Fisheries held a public hearing in Washington DC to discuss the EEPNPRM. A copy of the transcript of this hearing has been placed in the regulatorydocket at the Office of the Marine Safety Council, U.S. Coast Guard, Room3600, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal persons involved in drafting this final rule were LCDR AnthonyDupree, Jr., Project Manager, and Mr. Stephen H. Barber, Project Counsel,Office of Chief Counsel. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background and Objectives </ITAG>The principal objective of this final rule is to ensure that Outer ContinentalShelf (OCS) facility and emergency assistance personnel are provided withthe direction and equipment necessary for a timely and safe evacuationof an OCS facility in an emergency. The final rule establishes a performancestandard which requires operators (i.e. leaseholders or other entitiesmanaging the leasehold) of all manned OCS facilities (i.e. fixed facilities,floating facilities, and mobile offshore drilling units (MODU's) engagedin OCS activities) to develop and be prepared to implement emergency evacuationprocedures that address all of the recognized circumstances and conditionsthat would require an evacuation of the facility. In developing the final rule, the Coast Guard considered the diversityof the environmental conditions that exist on the OCS and the varying operationalcharacteristics of fixed OCS facilities and MODU's. The Coast Guard believesthat the final rule provides sufficient flexibility for operators to developa site specific EEP which will address the specific evacuation needs ofeach OCS facility. The final rule allows operators to explore and, wherepossible, integrate the latest technology available to ensure the safetyof OCS workers. To ensure that the EEP's adequately address all of the recognized circumstancesand conditions that may result in evacuation of the facility, the CoastGuard will review and, if acceptable, approve each EEP before it is placedon the facility. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments and Changes to the Regulation </ITAG>A total of forty-two letters were received in response to the NPRM. Fortyletters generally supported the concept of an evacuation per-performancestandard but all of the letters contained suggestions for revising theproposed regulations. Two letters opposed the proposed regulations andsuggested that they were not needed. The comments and the resulting changesare discussed below. 1. Three comment letters received from offshore industry associations requestedextension of the original comment period because of the importance of thisregulatory initiative and the difficulty their members were experiencingin providing a meaningful response within the original 30 day comment period.The Coast Guard agreed with this request and extended the comment periodfor an additional 30 days until February 25, 1985, (53 FR 2236; January26, 1988). 2. Two comments objected to the proposal because they believed that theproposed rulemaking duplicated already existing Department of Transportationregulations in 49 CFR Part 192 and that compliance with the proposed rules,therefore, would be redundant and burdensome. They suggested that the proposedrules be removed from consideration as they offer no improvement to currentregulations. This suggestion was not adopted. Part 192 of Title 49 of the Code of FederalRegulations is limited to matters relating to the transportation of gasby pipeline. Section 192.615 requires gas pipeline operators to establishwritten procedures to minimize the hazards resulting from a gas pipelineemergency. Only facilities engaged in gas pipeline operations are requiredto comply with andSection; 192.615. The EEP regulations apply to all OCSfacilities. Gas pipeline facility operators, however, may include pertinentsections of the gas pipeline emergency procedures in their EEP or submitthe gas pipeline emergency procedures to the Coast Guard for review ifthe operator feels it complies with the EEP regulations. 3. Three comments stated that 46 U.S.C. 2304 already allows any vesselto respond to calls for assistance without being required to meet additionalregulations. One of the comments also stated that 46 U.S.C. 3501(e) alreadyauthorizes an offshore supply vessel (OSV) to carry passengers in an emergency.In view of these provisions, all three comments suggested that it is improperfor the Coast Guard to require that standby vessels be certificated. The EEP regulations would not prohibit a vessel from responding to a callfor assistance under the provisions of 43 U.S.C. 2304 or prohibit OSV'sfrom carrying passengers during an emergency. However, any vessel thatis designated as a facility's standby vessel in an EEP, thus making therescue or evacuation of OCS personnel its primary duty, will be requiredto be in compliance with the requirements contained in andSection; 143.401(a).Therefore, this suggestion was not adopted.4. Fifteen comments stated that the requirement for a standby vessel tobe certificated to carry all of the persons on the most populated facilitythat the standby vessel is designated to assist is excessive. The commentsstated that few vessels exist that could meet this requirement. Proposed andSection; 143.401(b) was intended to ensure that the standby vesselwould be capable of providing safe shelter for all of the evacuees thatthe vessel is to rescue. The Coast Guard has reevaluated proposed andSection;143.401(b) and agrees that it may be excessive. Therefore, andSection; 143.401(b)has been revised to require that a standby vessel must be capable of carryingand providing safe shelter for 100 per cent of the persons on the mostpopulated facility it is serving, rather than be certificated to carryall of those persons. Most clean, dry, interior spaces on a standby vessel,including crew spaces and corridors, could be considered safe shelter foremergency transportation of evacuees. Because revised andSection; 143.401(b)no longer requires a designated standby vessel to be certificated to carryall the persons on the most populated facility it is designated to assist,the designated standby vessel would not be required by the vessel inspectionregulations to provide bunks, seats, or life preservers for the personnelon the facility it is designated to assist. Therefore, a new andSection;143.401(c) has been added that requires a designated standby vessel toprovide bunks or aircraft type reclining seats for 10 per cent of the personson the most populated facility the vessel is designated to assist. Thisrequirement was added in order to ensure that the vessel will be capableof accommodating individuals who may be physically injured or sufferingfrom exhaustion. Crew spaces may be used to comply with this requirement.Also, a new andSection; 143.405(a)(17) has been added that requires designatedstandby vessels to provide life preservers for 50 per cent of the personson the most populated facility the vessel is designated to assist. Thisrequirement was added to ensure that the designated standby vessel willbe capable of providing life preservers for facility personnel in the eventsome of the personnel were unable to obtain a life preserver from the facilitybefore evacuation to the designated standby vessel. Because standby vesselswill no longer be required to be certificated to carry all the personson the most populated facility the vessel is designated to assist, andSection;143.405(a)(16) has been revised to require the standby vessel to have anindustrial first aid kit sized for 50 percent of the number of personson the most populated facility the standby vessel is designated to assist.This revision was made to ensure that the designated standby vessel willhave sufficient first aid supplies to treat injured evacuees. 5. One comment stated that vessels, when serving as designated standbyvessels, should be prohibited from carrying hazardous materials and fromcarrying or storing goods or equipment on the decks of the vessel. Thecomment stated that such goods, equipment, and hazardous materials couldinhibit the ability of the vessel to respond to emergencies. The Coast Guard agrees with the comment and has added new andSection; 143.401(d) and (e) which prohibit designated standby vessels from carrying orstoring hazardous materials and from carrying or storing goods, supplies,or equipment on the deck of the vessel or any other location that may hinderevacuation operations. 6. Three comments stated that the term ``highly maneuverable'' in referenceto standby vessels in proposed andSection; 143.403 lacks precision and isopen to different interpretations as to what standard is acceptable. Itwas suggested that proposed andSection; 143.403 be deleted because maneuverabilityappears to be sufficiently covered by andSection; 143.405(a)(1). The Coast Guard agrees with the comments and proposed andSection; 143.403has been deleted from the final rule. 7. Sixteen comments were received regarding the proposed requirement fora fast rescue boat (FRB). The comments stated that an FRB is difficultto launch and retrieve, particularly during heavy seas, and that specialcrew training would be required for proper operation of the boat. The commentssuggested that the requirement for a fast rescue boat be deleted. Two ofthe comments stated that the requirement for a means of retrieving injuredor helpless persons from the water contained in proposed andSection; 143.405(a)(8)is sufficient. The comments stated that modern offshore supply vesselsand crewboats often are highly maneuverable and can be equipped or modifiedfor direct pickup of persons from the water. The Coast Guard has reevaluated this issue and partially agrees with thecomments. The Coast Guard believes that all standby vessels must be equippedwith a safe and effective means of retrieving persons from the water, particularlyhelpless or injured persons. Although the Coast Guard believes that FRB'shave been proven to be one of the best means for retrieving persons fromthe water, it recognizes that, in some sea states, the FRB's themselvescan be difficult to launch and retrieve. The Coast Guard also agrees thatOSV's and crewboats may be capable of being equipped or modified to permitdirect retrieval of persons from the water onto the deck of those vessels.Therefore, the proposed requirement for an FRB has been replaced with andSection;143.405(a)(7), which requires that a means for retrieving persons, includinghelpless and injured persons, from the water be provided. The means ofretrieval may be either a FRB or some other type of equipment or modificationinstalled on the standby vessel. Under andSection; 143.405(a)(7), the meansof retrieving persons from the water must be demonstrated to the satisfactionof the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection. 8. Four comments stated that immersion and buoyant suits are already requiredby Coast Guard regulations for vessels operating above 32 degrees northlatitude. The comments stated that the EEP rules should not expand uponthis requirement and suggested that proposed andSection; 143.405(a)(11) bedeleted. After reevaluating the proposed requirement the Coast Guard agrees thatimmersion and or buoyant suits should be required only on standby vesselsoperating above 32 degrees north latitude in the Atlantic Ocean or northof 35 degrees north latitude in all other waters. However, current CoastGuard regulations for immersion/buoyant suits are not applicable to crewboatsor other vessels certificated under Subchapters T or H of 46 CFR ChapterI. Therefore, andSection; 143.405(a)(10) has been retained but revised toapply only to standby vessels operating in those colder waters. 9. Six comments stated that the 600 gallons per minute (gpm) fire monitorrequired in proposed andSection; 143.405(a)(13) is not of a standard sizecommonly found in the offshore industry. In order to permit the use offire monitors currently found in the offshore industry, the comments suggestedthat the monitor size be changed to either 500 or 750 gpm. The Coast Guard agrees with this suggestion and has revised andSection; 143.405(a)(12)to require a fire monitor with a flow rate of at least 500 gpm. 10. One comment stated that, in addition to requiring a means of radiocommunication between facilities and standby vessels, the regulations shouldrequire a means of communicating with helicopters and other rescue craftthat may take part in an evacuation. The Coast Guard agrees with the comment and andSection;andSection; 143.405(a)(13)and 146.140(d)(5) have been revised respectively to require standby vesselsand facilities to be capable of communicating with other rescue craft.11. Six comments stated that the standby vessel crew size should be determinedby the vessel owner and that facility operator. It was suggested that proposedandSection; 143.407 be revised to allow the vessel owner and facility operatorsufficient flexibility in determining the crew size which best supportsthe facility's EEP.The manning requirement in proposed andSection; 143.407 represents the minimumcrew size that the Coast Guard believes is necessary to properly crew astandby vessel. However, there will be cases in which the Officer in Charge,Marine Inspection, (OCMI) believes that the crew designated on the vessel'scertificate of inspection for 24 hour operation is not sufficient to carryout the functions required of the vessel when it is operating as a standbyvessel. In those cases, the OCMI is authorized under andSection; 143.407to require additional crewmembers as necessary. The vessel owners or thefacility operator may increase the crew size above the minimum set by theOCMI if they believe additional crewmembers are needed. Therefore, thissuggestion was not adopted. 12. Four comments stated that the EEP regulations should contain a requirementfor periodic evacuation drills. The comments stated that periodic interactivedrills that test and exercise all the key elements of the EEP are neededto verify that the plan continues to be viable. The Coast Guard agrees that periodic drills are necessary to ensure thatall personnel are familiar with the EEP. Therefore, a new andSection; 146.125(c)has been added to require that abbreviated EEP drills be held monthly andthat a comprehensive drill exercising all elements of the EEP be conductedannually. Also, a new andSection; 146.140(e)(3) has been added to requirethe operator to ensure that the drills are conducted. 13. Two comments stated that development of a separate EEP for each facilitymay not be necessary. The comments suggested that the regulations shouldallow the development of EEP's covering several facilities in a generalgeographic location.The Coast Guard agrees with the comments and has revised andSection; 146.140(b)to permit the development of an EEP covering multiple sites in the samegeographic area. However, care should be exercised in the development ofEEP's covering more than one facility to ensure that the specific needsof each facility are addressed and that the plan does not become overlycomplicated or so voluminous that its usefulness is jeopardized. 14. Four comments questioned the need to submit the EEP to the OCMI forexamination. The comments suggested that, instead of submitting the preparedEEP to the OCMI, the EEP should be maintained on the facility and madeavailable to the Coast Guard for examination during an on-site inspectionor upon request of the OCMI. The Coast Guard believes that review of the EEP before it is placed onthe facility will give the the Coast Guard the opportunity to inform thefacility operator of areas in the plan that the Coast Guard found to beinadequately addressed and in need of revision. Therefore, this suggestionhas not been adopted. 15. Three comments stated that the Coast Guard should review and approveEEP's instead of just examining them. The comments stated that, unlessthe Coast Guard requires the plans to be approved, there will be no wayfor the Coast Guard to reject an inadequate EEP. The Coast Guard agrees with the comments and has revised andSection; 146.140(a)and (b) to require the plans to be submitted to the OCMI for review andapproval. The OCMI will review the EEP and determine if the plan addressesall the conditions and criteria contained in the EEP regulations. Plansthat are determined to be satisfactory will be stamped ``APPROVED'' andreturned to the facility operator with a letter indicating Coast Guardapproval. Plans that are determined to be deficient will be stamped ``RETURNEDFOR REVISION'' and returned to the facility operator with a letter identifyingthe areas that the Coast Guard found deficient and requiring the plan tobe revised and resubmitted for approval within a specified period of time.Once the EEP is approved, a copy of the stamped plan and a copy of theaccompanying Coast Guard approval letter are required to be maintainedon the facility under revised andSection; 146.140(b). Facility operatorswho fail to have their EEP approved by the Coast Guard will be subjectto penalty under 33 CFR 140.35. 16. One comment suggested that EEP's for MODU's designate the master orperson in charge of the MODU as the person who is primarily responsiblefor implementing the EEP under andSection; 146.140(d)(7). The Goast Guardagrees and has added a new andSection; 146.210(d) accordingly. 17. Three comments suggested that ``other safe place,'' as used in proposedandSection; 146.140(d)(10), be explained in the regulations. The Coast Guardagrees and has revised andSection; 146.140(d)(12)(iv) to explain what areconsidered to be places of safety. The Coast Guard believes that placesof safety may vary with the circumstances and conditions described in theEEP under andSection; 146.140(d)(9). The EEP must provide for evacuationto land under certain situations and may provide for evacuation to a vessel,lifeboat, or another facility under other situations. For example, theEEP may provide for evacuation to a vessel, lifeboat, or another facilityin the event of a localized fire on a facility. However, in the event ofpredictable incidents, such as ice floes, or storms exceeding the designcharacteristics of the facility, the EEP must provide for evacuation toland. 18. Three comments stated that, while the proposed rules require standbyvessels to have a means of retrieving persons from the water, there isno similar requirement to provide for retrieving persons from the waterif a standby vessel is not used. The comments suggested that the CoastGuard should include such a requirement in the regulations. The Coast Guard agrees and has added andSection; 146.140(d)(12)(i) to requirethat the EEP identify the means that will be used to retrieve persons fromthe water during an evacuation. 19. Two comments stated that the proposed rules did not require facilityoperators to identify in the EEP the means that would be used to transferpersons from the facility to a standby vessel or other craft and to retrievethose persons from the standby vessel or craft onto, for example, anotherfacility. The Coast Guard agrees and has added andSection; 146.140(d)(12)(ii) and (d)(12)(iii)to require that the EEP identify the means that will be used to transferfacility personnel to and from standby vessels, lifeboats, or other typesof evacuation craft. 20. One comment stated that the requirement in proposed andSection; 146.140(f)that a written summary of the EEP be given to each person newly reportingon the facility is a needless expense and that the EEP may be difficultto summarize.The Coast Guard agrees that the EEP may be difficult to summarize but believesthat persons newly reporting on the facility should be made aware of thecontents of the EEP. Therefore, andSection; 146.140(f) has been revised torequire that either a brief written summary or an oral briefing on theEEP be given each person newly reporting on the facility. 21. Eight comments stated that standby vessels or some sort of vessel supportis necessary in order to ensure the safe emergency evacuation of OCS facilities.The comments suggested that the Coast Guard require facility operatorsto provide standby vessels or some form of vessel support for the emergencyevacuation of OCS facilities. The Coast Guard agrees that standby vessels,in some cases, could enhance the safety of some OCS facilities. However,the high cost of providing a properly equipped and manned standby vesselmay not always be justified under the circumstances of each case. The CoastGuard believes that evacuation measures using equipment other than standbyvessels, such as helicopters, may prove to be equally effective and morecost efficient in many emergency evacuation situations. Therefore, thesuggestion that standby vessels be required in every case was not adopted.22. Ten comments stated that OCS facility operators should be responsiblefor submitting EEP's only for fixed facilities on their leases and notfor MODU's. (An ``operator'' of an OCS facility is defined in andSection;140.10 as meaning the leaseholder or person controlling or managing thelease area or a portion of the lease area and ``OCS facility'' means afixed or floating facility, as well as a MODU in contact with seabed.)The comments stated that operators are not always familiar with the MODU'sequipment and that the MODU owners are best able to determine the evacuationcriteria for their units. The comments suggested that MODU owners shouldbe required to develop and submit the EEP for their MODU's. It is critical that EEP's be comprehensive and coordinated from a singlesource. The Coast Guard believes that operators will be able to developEEP's that will allow for the easy incorporation of MODU specific data.Operators would be responsible for developing the EEP, determining themeans of transportation to a place of safety, providing the shoreside supportand the weather forecasting service, and listing the duties of the personsto be contacted in event of an emergency. MODU owners should be able toreadily provide the operators with the data needed to incorporate the MODU'sequipment and design criteria into the EEP. Therefore, this suggestionwas not adopted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Incorporation by Reference </ITAG>The material, ``Standard for Marine Buoyant Devices'' (ANSI/UL1123-1987),in andSection; 147.7 has been approved for incorporation by reference bythe Director of the Federal Register under 5 U.S.C. 552 and 1 CFR Part51. The material is available as indicated in that section. If substantive changes are made by the publisher to the materials incorporated,those changes may be considered for incorporation. However, before takingfinal action on the incorporation, the Coast Guard will publish a separatenotice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> for public comment. The reference to the SOLAS Convention in andSection; 143.405(a)(5) of theNPRM has been deleted in the final rule and, therefore, from the list ofmaterials in andSection; 140.7. Section 140.7 is revised to conform witha new format that lists the sections throughout Subchapter N in which theincorporated material appears. <ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures </ITAG>These regulations are considered to be non-major under Executive Order12291 and significant under the Department of Transportation (DOT) regulatorypolicies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). This rule isconsidered significant because of the high level of public and Congressionalinterest in this project. A final regulatory evaluation has been preparedand placed in the rulemaking docket. It may be inspected or copied at theOffice of the Marine Safety Council, Room 3600, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters,2100 Second St. SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001, (202) 267-1477, from 8a.m. to 3 p.m. Copies may also be obtained by contacting that office. The cost of preparing an EEP may vary due to the varying complexity ofthe manned facilities operating on the OCS and the experience of the preparerin drafting emergency evacuation plans. Much of the required informationis already available and is customarily provided to operating personnel.However, some information not previously required may need to be compiled.The Coast Guard estimates the cost of preparing a plan which meets theseregulations to be approximately $725 per facility. The total initial costto industry for providing an EEP for each manned facility, including MODU's,is estimated to be approximately $785,000. The total cost to the CoastGuard to review and approve an EEP is estimated to be $100 per plan. Specific comments were solicited on the costs of preparing and updatingEEP's for OCS facilities and several comments were received. Two commentswere received on the costs of preparing and updating the EEP's. The commentsestimated that the cost of preparing and updating EEP's would be at least$2,000 per OCS facility. Neither comment provided a specific analysis ofwhat their estimated costs included. The Coast Guard reconsidered its costestimates for preparing and updating an EEP and concluded that they arereasonable. The Coast Guard estimated cost represents the estimated averagecost for preparation and update of an EEP. The Coast Guard recognizes thatthe costs may be higher for some companies. However, many facility ownersalready have some basic evacuation procedures in effect and much of theinformation required by the EEP regulations is readily available. Further,many facility owners will be able to prepare one EEP that can be made applicableto numerous facilities because of their close geographic location and similardesign and equipment (andSection; 146.140(b)). Recent regulations (52 FR6974; March 6, 1987) require that MODU operating manuals provide informationfor use in emergency situations (46 CFR 109.121). EEP's may incorporatecertain portions of the operating manual to avoid unnecessary duplicationand cut preparation costs. Five comments were received on the cost to the Coast Guard for the examinationof each EEP. All five comments questioned whether the Coast Guard couldconduct an indepth review of an EEP for $100 a plan. The Coast Guard basedits cost estimate on its experience in the review of other documents, onits assumption that many of the plans, particularly those submitted bythe same operator, will be similar, and on its estimate that it will takean average of three man hours to review each plan. Though the initial costsfor reviewing and approving the first EEP's submitted for approval maybe higher, we feel our cost estimates for review of all the EEP's are reasonable.Specific comments were solicited on the costs of equipping a certificatedvessel as a standby vessel and on the anticipated use of standby vessels.For the purpose of evaluating this rule, the Coast Guard assumed that upto 30 standby vessels would be designated in EEP's. The Coast Guard estimatedthe cost of equipping a certificated offshore supply vessel or crew boatto comply with the standby vessel requirements contained in the EEP regulationsto be between $6,600 and $25,400. Based on these assumptions, tbe totalinitial cost to the support vessel industry to outfit certificated vesselsas standby vessels is estimated to be between $198,000 and $762,000. Thesecosts are lower than the ones contained in the NPRM's draft regulatoryevaluation because the cost of equipping a designated standby vessel witha fast rescue boat (FRB) has been eliminated by the removal of the FRBrequirement from the final rule. The Coast Guard estimated that the dayrate for vessels equipped and manned as standby vessels would increasean average of $177 per day. Further, the total cost to the lease operatorsemploying these 30 standby vessels is estimated to be between $8,366,000and $9,057,000 per year.Two comment letters were received on the Coast Guard's estimated increasein the day rate for vessels used as standby vessels. The comments statedthat the day rate for an offshore supply vessel (OSV) or crewboat equippedto comply with the standby vessel standards contained in the regulationswould increase $200 to $500 per day. In developing its estimate of themaximum increase in the day rate for a vessel equipped and manned as astandby vessel, the Coast Guard gathered information from offshore informationservices and marine suppliers. The Coast Guard's estimate of the averageincrease ($177) in the day rate is believed to be reasonable. Several comments concerning the number of standby vessels likely to beused under these regulations were received. One comment stated that theCoast Guard's estimate of the number of standby vessels likely to be employedin OCS operations (30) is too low. However, the comment did not providean alternate figure on the contention that an accurate count could notbe determined until facility operators had completed their impact assessmentof the rules. Six comments on the estimated number of standby vessels statedthat few, if any, standby vessels would be employed if the vessels wererequired to comply with the proposed andSection; 143.401(b). The proposedregulation would have required designated standby vessels to be certificatedto carry all the persons on the most populated OCS facility that the standbyvessel is designated to serve. The comments stated that few existing vesselswould be able to meet the proposed requirement and the cost of modifyingan existing vessel or building new ones to comply with this requirementwould be prohibitive. The Coast Guard has reconsidered this requirementand has revised andSection; 143.401(b) in the final rule to require thatstandby vessels be capable of carrying and sheltering 100 per cent of thepersonnel on the most populated facility that the vessel is designatedto assist, rather than being certificated for the routine carriage of thatnumber of persons. However, the comments provided no additional data onthe number of standby vessels that would be used if the proposed andSection;143.401(b) was deleted. The primary objective of this rulemaking is to address evacuation planningfor OCS facilities, including MODU's, thereby enhancing the safety of lifeand property on the OCS. However, it is difficult, if not impossible, toquantify the benefits of the regulations because of the unpredictable occurrenceand limitless variety of emergency situations in which EEP's would be ofassistance. Although EEP's would not replace well trained personnel, theycan be of significant benefit. Recent estimates of the value of a humanlife have ranged from $1,000,000 to $11,000,000. The saving of only a fewlives each year would make the preparation of the evacuation plans andthe additional requirements imposed on designated standby vessels costbeneficial. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>These regulations will affect owners and operators of manned OCS facilitiesand the owners, builders, and suppliers of designated standby vessels.Because of the extremely high cost of these manned facilities, their ownersand operators tend to be major corporations. However, it is likely thatat least some of the companies opting to enter the designated standby vesselbusiness may be considered small entities. An estimate for outfitting atypical certificated vessel as a standby vessel is between $6,600 and $25,400.Because the use of designated standby vessels is voluntary, we have nobasis for estimating how many standby vessels will be employed. For thepurposes of evaluating this rulemaking, we have assumed that a total of30 standby vessels will be employed. Based on these assumptions, the totalinitial cost to the support vessel industry to outfit certificated vesselsas standby vessels will be between $198,000 and $762,000. Further, we estimatethat the day rate for a standby vessel outfitted according to the regulationswill increase by as much as $177 a day over the day rate for the same vesselwithout standby vessel equipment in order to cover the added expenses.The Coast Guard requested that individuals who believe that their businessmay qualify as a small entity and felt that the proposed rules would havea significant economic impact on their business notify the Coast Guardand explain why they felt their business qualified. Such individuals wererequested to explain in what way and to what degree they would be economicallyeffected by the proposed regulations. Six comments were received on the impact of this rulemaking on small entities.Though none of the six comments explained why they felt their businessesqualified as a small entity, they all believed that proposed andSection;143.401 on certification requirements for standby vessels and proposedandSection; 143.405 on standby vessel equipment would have a significanteconomic impact on small boat companies. The comments stated that noneof the current vessels operating on the OCS could comply with proposedandSection; 143.401(b) and that few of the small boat owners would be ableto afford to equip their vessels with all the equipment proposed in andSection;143.405, particularly the fast rescue boat (FRB). The comments stated thatif the Coast Guard persisted in implementing these regulations that itwould mean the end of the many small boat companies. The Coast Guard hasreconsidered andSection;andSection; 143.401 and 143.405 and deleted the requirementthat a standby vessel be certificated to carry all the persons on the facilityit is serving, and the requirement for a FRB, to lessen the economic impactof the regulations without decreasing the level of safety intended by thisrulemaking. Further, a concern was expressed during the Subcommittee hearing as towhether these rules would affect the continued use of those vessels commonlyreferred to as ``field boats'' (i.e., vessels, usually small, used to carrymaterials and personnel between OCS facilities). These regulations willnot affect field boats unless they are designated as standby vessels forthe purposes of the EEP. For the above reasons, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) that this final rule willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>This rulemaking contains information collection requirements in andSection;andSection;146.140 and 146.210.
