Among other things, this Act requiresthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a two-yeardemonstration program for tracking medical waste generated in States subjectto the program, even if the wastes are ultimately taken out of the Statefor treatment or disposal. The regulations establishing this program mustinclude a list of medical wastes to be tracked and minimum standards forsegregation from other wastes, packaging, and labeling before transportto treatment and/or disposal facilities. Facilities that incinerate medicalwaste on-site are also subject to certain reporting requirements. The MWTAdesignates Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and those States borderingthe Great Lakes as being subject to the demonstration tracking program.Under certain conditions, however, these designated States may opt outof the program. In addition, any other State may petition the Agency toparticipate in the program. These regulations apply to medical waste generators in States that participatein the program. In addition, they apply to other handlers (transporters,transfer facilities, and treatment or disposal facilities) who manage regulatedmedical wastes that originated in a State that participates in the demonstrationtracking program. The Act also requires EPA to submit a final report and two interim reportsto Congress discussing the program's overall success and the informationobtained from the program to date. The results of the demonstration programwill assist Congress in determining whether or not the provisions of themedical waste tracking program should be extended nationwide. Today's interim final rule specifies the procedures and criteria underwhich States may petition in or opt out of the demonstration program. Italso lists the wastes identified by EPA as medical wastes for the purposesof the Medical Waste Tracking Act and sets forth the regulations and standardsfor implementing the demonstration tracking program under the Act. In addition,today's rule requests public comment on the regulations presented here.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>The regulation is effective June 22, 1989.<T3>Compliance_</T3> The effective date for the demonstration program isJune 22, 1989 through June 22, 1991. Transporters must notify EPA priorto collecting or transporting regulated medical waste generated in a CoveredState during the demonstration program.

Background</ITAG>A. The Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988The Medical Waste Tracking Act (MWTA) of 1988 was signed into law on November1, 1988. This Act amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act, commonly referredto as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), to require theAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgateregulations that establish a demonstration tracking system for medicalwaste.The MWTA was enacted as a response to public concern over the degradationof shoreline areas, particularly in Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York,from washups of sewage and other waste. The medical debris raising themost concern were wastes, such as needles, syringes, blood bags, bandages,and vials. See 134 Cong. Rec. S 10737 (August 3, 1988). There were alsoreports of other incidents of careless management of medical waste; forinstance, by disposal into open dumpsters, creating additional concernfor public safety. 134 Cong. Rec. H 9536 (October 4, 1988).The result of the beach washups was the closure of beaches, economic lossesin affected shore communities, and public concern over the health hazardsassociated with medical wastes and the general degradation of the shoreenvironment. 134 Cong. Rec. S 19745 (August 4, 1988) and 134 Cong. Rec.H 9536 (October 4, 1988). Improper management of medical waste raised concernsover the health risks posed by the infectious character of the waste, thephysical hazard posed by the wastes, particularly needles and other sharps,and the aesthetic degradation of the vulnerable shoreline environment.134 Cong. Rec. S 10738 (August 3, 1988). Congress found the appearanceof medical waste on the beaches to be repugnant, intolerable, and unacceptable.134 Cong. Rec. S 10739-S 10745 (August 4, 1988).The MWTA was enacted against this background of health and environmentalconcerns. The Act was intended to be a first step in addressing these problems.134 Cong. Rec. S 15327 (October 7, 1988). The Act establishes a ``cradleto grave'' system to track medical waste generated in the regions mostaffected by medical waste mismanagement problems to its final destination.The Act thus is intended to address the medical waste mismanagement problemin several ways. First, the tracking system is designed to be implementedquickly so that, to the extent the program controls sources contributingto washups, washups of medical waste in the summer of 1989 will be avoided.<T3>Id. </T3>Second, the bill was designed to prevent careless managementof the waste by establishing tracking and storage requirements and subjectingviolators to administrative, civil, and criminal penalties. 134 Cong. Rec.S 15328 (October 7, 1988). Third, the Act was intended to provide, throughthe tracking system, assurance that the medical waste generated in theaffected States in fact reaches its intended destination, and a mechanismfor tracing incidents of improper disposal to responsible parties. 134Cong. Rec. H 9537 (October 4, 1988) and 134 Cong. Rec. S 10745 (August3, 1988). As noted by the sponsor of the bill, the tracking system is intendedto work as a ``burglar alarm,'' alerting EPA and State officials wheneverwaste has not reached its intended destination and leaving a paper trailthat will lead to the violators. 134 Cong. Rec. H 9536 (October 4, 1988).Finally, the legislation is intended to provide information to Congresson the effectiveness of the program and whether and how a broader programshould be developed. 134 Cong. Rec. S 10743 (August 3, 1988).EPA has developed a regulatory program that should accomplish a numberof objectives set forth in the Act. Under today's regulations, increasedquantities of medical waste will be packaged securely. This will reducethe chances of waste handlers and the public being exposed to medical waste.Although currently available data suggest that medical waste does not generallypose a significant potential for disease transmission, proper packagingwill reduce physical hazards (i.e., needle sticks, etc.), and it will helpensure that any health risks are minimized.Second, due to the presence of labels, marking tags, and a uniform trackingform, medical waste will be more easily identified. This should serve asa deterrent to careless or otherwise improper waste management, and itwill help identify parties who do not manage their waste properly. Betteridentification of medical waste is also likely to lead to the waste beingmanaged separately from, and with greater care than, general refuse.The principal intent of the Act was to prevent beach closings caused bythe washup of medical waste. However, the available evidence suggests thatthe tracking program established today may have only a limited effect onreducing beach washups.According to the report of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation(NYDEC), <T3>Investigation: Sources of the Beach Washups of 1988, </T3>November,1988 (on file for public review in the docket), the debris that washedup on New Jersey and New York beaches consisted of ``floatables,'' solidwastes such as household trash and garbage, wood and miscellaneous debris.NYDEC estimated that between 1% and 10% of these floatables consisted ofinsulin-type syringes, blood vials, and other ``medical-related waste''.The other ``medical related waste'' category encompasses several wastetypes <T3>not </T3>included within today's listing of regulated medical wasteand hence not subject to regulation.NYDEC's investigations of the 1988 washups and comparison with earlierbeach washups have led to the following conclusions:andbullet; With few exceptions, floatable debris cannot be traced to anyspecific source;andbullet; Most of these wastes are likely to come from:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The improper transport and handling of solid waste destined for disposalat the Fresh Kills landfill;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Inadequate handling procedures, supervision, and maintenance at themarine transfer stations;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Combined sewer overflows;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Raw sewage discharges caused by occasional breakdowns at one or moreof New York City's sewage treatment plants; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Storm water outlets; </ITAG>andbullet; Other activities that were judged less likely to contribute include:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Litter deposited by beach users; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Recreational boating; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Commercial shipping; </ITAG>andbullet; Floatables that become stranded on sandbars are sometimes refloatedby the tides and washed ashore; andbullet; Weather conditions contributed to the volume and persistence ofwashups; and andbullet; Illegal disposal appears to account for some of the wastes (i.e.,the blood vials). The amount of medical waste washup was extremely small compared with boththe total amount of garbage that washed ashore and the volume of such wastegenerated and disposed by New York City's hospitals. Moreover, had thesewastes emanated from a hospital, a larger variety of waste types wouldhave been present. Specifically, more noninsulin type syringes, bloodybandages and dressings, bed sheets, and surgical gowns and gloves wouldhave appeared. According to the NYDEC report, the extent and public health significanceof medical waste washups were exaggerated by inaccurate news reports. Forexample, household trash was misidentified as medical waste, and what wereerroneously reported to be discarded laboratory animals turned out to becommon sewer rats that had drowned at sea. Evidence indicates that some of the regulated medical waste is being placedinto the solid waste stream of New York City. Hospitals are sometimes laxin sorting their wastes; doctors, laboratories, nursing homes, and clinicssometimes mix medical-related waste with trash; and intentional dumpingof regulated medical waste is done to avoid the expense of disposal. Outpatientssuch as diabetics and other intravenous users also dispose of their wastein municipal trash. In summary, today's regulations may not significantly reduce the amountof medical waste deposited on beaches. Sources of medical waste not addressedby the regulations (e.g., household medical care and intravenous drug use)are known to contribute significantly to beach waste wash-ups. However,the regulations should ensure that medical wastes from institutions andcommercial sources are being managed properly. Furthermore, one of theintentions of the MWTA is to provide information to Congress about thesources and possible solutions to the medical waste problem. During thetwo-year demonstration program, EPA will collect information on the scopeof the medical waste problem, the usefulness of the tracking system insolving that problem, and the availability of other effective solutions.EPA will be assessing the effects of the program over the next two years.Generally we will look at factors such as: (1) The extent of compliance with the requirements. (2) The quantity and type of debris found on beaches in 1989 and 1990,and compare the results with those from last summer. EPA will try to assess what sources are contributing to medical waste foundon beaches, and therefore, to what extent the demonstration program, evenwhen fully implemented, can reduce washups. Finally, EPA will examine the comments received on today's rule. Many partsof the rule, such as the scope of the wastes that are covered and the packagingrequirements, are based on EPA's best technical judgement. Comments mayprovide additional information and expert recommendations. Additional informationmay also be available from other sources, such as the study the Agencyfor Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) will be conducting underRCRA section 11009. This is discussed below. B. Subtitle J of RCRA The Medical Waste Tracking Act adds Subtitle J, discussed below, to RCRA.<T3>Section 11001 </T3>describes the scope of the demonstration program,which includes Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and the States contiguousto the Great Lakes, which are Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio,Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Other States may petition the EPA Administratorfor inclusion in the program. The States which have petitioned in, to date,include American Samoa. States in the program are referred to as ``CoveredStates.''The States bordering the Great Lakes may opt out of the demonstration programby notifying EPA by April 24, 1989. In addition, Connecticut, New Jersey,and New York may remove themselves from participation if the Governor ofthe State notifies the Administrator by April 24, 1989, and EPA determinesthat the State has implemented a medical waste tracking program no lessstringent than that promulgated by EPA under Subtitle J. Section 11001(d)provides that the program will expire two (2) years after the effectivedate of the regulations. Finally, States that wish to petition in mustdo so by April 24, 1989, in order to be considered for inclusion in thedemonstration program. <T3>Section 11002 </T3>of the Act designates the following general typesor classes of medical wastes that must be tracked under the demonstrationprogram: (1) Cultures and stocks of infectious agents and associated biologicals;(2) pathological waste; (3) human blood and blood products; (4) used sharps(e.g., syringes, needles and surgical blades); (5) contaminated animalcarcasses; (6) surgery or autopsy waste; (7) laboratory wastes; (8) dialysiswastes; (9) discarded medical equipment; and (10) isolation wastes. Section11002 requires EPA to promulgate regulations within six (6) months followingenactment of MWTA (May 1, 1989) that list all of the wastes that are subjectto tracking. EPA cannot exclude any wastes in the first five waste types(1-5), but is authorized to exclude wastes in the second five waste types(6-10) if the Administrator determines that such wastes do not pose a substantialpresent or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperlymanaged. Further, EPA may regulate other waste associated with medicalcare that the Agency determines poses a substantial threat to human healthor the environment. As required by this section, EPA has developed thelist in today's rule, and refers to the wastes covered by the rule as ``regulatedmedical wastes.'' <T3>Section 11003 </T3>discusses the requirements of the tracking program,for which EPA must promulgate regulations by May 1, 1989. Section 11003(a)specifies that the program must provide a system for tracking regulatedmedical wastes listed by EPA regulations under section 11002 (i.e., regulatedmedical waste), from a generator in a Covered State to the receiving, off-siteincineration or disposal facility. (Under today's rule, medical waste thatis incinerated, or otherwise treated and destroyed, must be tracked onlyto the point of such treatment and destruction, provided certain conditionsare met.) The tracking program must use a uniform form for tracking andinclude a system for providing generators with assurance that the disposalor treatment facility has received the waste. In addition, the trackingprogram must provide that: (1) Wastes are segregated at the point of generation,where practicable; (2) wastes are placed in containers that will protectwaste handlers and the public from exposure; and (3) appropriate labelsare placed on containers of the waste. Section 11003(d) allows EPA to establishvarious regulations for different types of medical waste and for differenttypes of generators. Under section 11003(b), EPA may exempt from the tracking program generatorsof less than 50 pounds of medical waste in a calendar month. Section 11003(c)requires that EPA establish recordkeeping and reporting requirements forgenerators that incinerate medical wastes on-site and that would, on thisbasis, be exempt from tracking waste. Reporting must include, at a minimum,the volume and types of medical wastes incinerated during the six (6) monthsafter the effective date of the tracking regulations. <T3>Section 11004 </T3>requires that any person who generates, stores,treats, transports, disposes, or otherwise handles medical waste must furnish,upon the request of any duly designated EPA official or representative,any information relating to such medical waste. The authority providedunder this section is <T3>not </T3>limited to demonstration States or facilities covered by SubtitleJ regulation nor is it limited to the types of medical waste regulatedfor purposes of the tracking program. The provisions of Section 11004 governany ``medical waste'' as defined in section 1004(40) of RCRA. The Act providesEPA this authority for access to information needed to support the developmentof any regulation or report required under Subtitle J, or to assist inthe enforcement of any provision of this Subtitle. <T3>Section 11005 </T3>contains enforcement provisions for the MWTA. Section11005(a) specifies that, upon determining that a violation of SubtitleJ has occurred, EPA may assess a civil penalty for any past or currentviolation and/or order of compliance, or commence a civil action in U.S.District Court. Penalties of up to $25,000 per day for each violation ofa requirement or prohibition under the Act or for failure to comply afterissuance of a compliance order may be assessed. An alleged violator mayrequest a public hearing within 30 days after EPA's issuance of an orderunder this section. Under section 11005(b), criminal penalties of up to $50,000 per day ofviolation or two (2) years of imprisonment may be assessed for those whoknowingly omit material information or give false information in documentsrequired under this Subtitle, or for those who knowingly handle listedmedical wastes and destroy, alter, or conceal required documents. Personswho knowingly violate the requirements or the regulations under SubtitleJ can be fined up to $50,000 per day of violation or imprisoned for upto five (5) years. Repeat offenders under this Subtitle are subject todouble the maximum penalties. Section 11005(c) specifies that any knowing violator who, at the time ofthe violations knowingly places another person in imminent danger of deathor serious bodily injury by his or her violation, may be fined up to $250,000or subject to imprisonment for 15 years, or both. Organizations may befined up to $1,000,000 for knowingly endangering another person. Section 11005(e) states that civil penalties assessed under this Act shallbe in accordance with the Administrator's RCRA civil penalty policy. <T3>Section 11006 </T3>pertains to Federal activities and requires allFederal agencies in a demonstration State to comply with the provisionsof this Act and with all Federal, State, interstate, and local medicalwaste requirements, both substantive and procedural, and including administrativeorders and criminal, civil, and administrative penalties. Certain exemptionsmay be granted by the President if they are in the paramount interest ofthe United States. The President must report to Congress each January allexemptions granted during the previous year. <T3>Section 11007 </T3>concerns Subtitle J's relationship to State law.Subtitle J does not preempt State or local law, or otherwise affect Statelaw, except that any State form for tracking medical waste from personssubject to regulation under Subtitle J must be identical to the one requiredby EPA in today's regulation. However, the State may require submissionof additional information. <T3>Section 11008 </T3>requires EPA to submit to Congress two interim reportsand a final report on medical waste and the demonstration tracking program.The final report is due within three (3) months following expiration ofthe demonstration program, and must include the following information:andbullet; An analysis of medical waste generators in the U.S., the typesand amounts of medical waste generated, and the methods currently usedto manage medical waste;andbullet; Evaluation of the threat posed by medical waste or its incinerationto human health and the environment;andbullet; Estimates of the costs associated with the improper managementof medical waste;andbullet; Estimates of the costs associated with the tracking and managementrequirements under the demonstration program;andbullet; An evaluation of the success of the demonstration program, resultingchanges in medical waste incineration and storage practices, and alternativetracking procedures;andbullet; An examination of available and potentially available methodsfor managing and treating medical waste, including factors influencingthe effectiveness of treatment methods;andbullet; An analysis of the existing State and local controls on the managementof medical waste and the appropriateness of using any existing State requirementsor RCRA Subtitle C (hazardous waste) controls nationwide for medical waste;andbullet; An evaluation of the appropriateness of the Act's provision forpenalties for insuring compliance, including a review of the penalty levelsimposed;andbullet; An evaluation of the effect of excluding households and smallquantity generators from medical waste regulation and potential guidelinesfor these parties; andandbullet; An examination of available and potentially available methodsfor the reuse or reduction in volume of medical waste generated. The two interim reports submitted to Congress must detail any informationavailable in these areas at the time of submission. These interim reportsare due on August 1, 1989, and June 22, 1990, respectively. Because ofthe Congressional and public interest in the medical waste problem, thefinal Report to Congress will contain a comprehensive evaluation of thedemonstration program. In the first interim report EPA will describe indetail the evaluation methodology to be used. The second interim reportwill provide preliminary results of this program evaluation. <T3>Section 11009 </T3>requires the Agency for Toxic Substances and DiseaseRegistry (ATSDR) to report to Congress, by November 1, 1990, the potentialfor infection or injury to workers and the public from handling medicalwaste, estimates concerning the number and seriousness of cases of infectionor injury resulting from handling sharps or from other medical waste managementactivities, and estimates concerning the number of cases of diseases traceableto medical wastes (particularly the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)and Hepatitis-B). EPA is coordinating its activities with ATSDR in thehealth assessment area. <T3>Section 11010 </T3>identifies general provisions for the Subtitle includinga requirement that EPA consult with the affected States (i.e., the 10 Statesnamed in the Act) on the regulations and with the International Joint Commissionwith respect to medical waste originating in Canada. In addition, thissection exempts EPA from otherwise applicable requirements for public commentunder the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and for paperwork burden analysisunder the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) concerning the listing and trackingregulations. <T3>Section 11011 </T3>establishes the effective date for regulations underSubtitle J. The regulations must become effective 90 days after promulgation,unless EPA finds that 90 days is unnecessary for compliance. Section III of the MWTA amended RCRA, adding a new definition of ``medicalwaste'' to Section 1004 of RCRA related to the new program establishedby the MWTA. C. Previous Agency Action Concerning Infectious Waste On December 18, 1978, the Agency proposed comprehensive regulations underthe Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by RCRA, for hazardous waste management.In this proposal, EPA proposed to classify certain infectious wastes ashazardous waste (43 FR 58946). (Wastes listed or designated by EPA as ``hazardous''under Section 3001 of RCRA are subject to stringent ``cradle-to-grave''regulations under Subtitle C of RCRA, which include, among other provisions,tracking of such wastes via a national uniform manifest, restrictions onland disposal, and permits for all treatment, storage, and disposal facilities.)The wastes proposed for listing in 1978 included infectious materials generatedby certain departments in health care facilities and veterinary hospitals,laboratories handling infectious agents, and sewage treatment facilities.These wastes would have been exempt if they were sterilized or incineratedin accordance with specified methods. EPA proposed to list these wastes as hazardous because the Agency believedat the time that if they were improperly managed, they could pose a substantialhazard to human health and the environment. Thus, such wastes would meetthe RCRA Section 1004 definition of ``hazardous waste.'' A number of commentsreceived in response to the proposed regulation claimed, however, thatthere was no evidence that infectious wastes pose serious hazards to humanhealth or the environment. As a result of these comments and EPA's reconsiderationof the hazards posed by these wastes, EPA did not list infectious wasteas a hazardous waste in the final rule (45 FR 33087; May 19, 1980). EPAexplained that it was not listing infectious waste at this time because``* * * the Agency has not been able to complete the work necessary toidentify the treatment methods it would allow to be used to exempt thesewastes from regulation''. <T3>Id. </T3>Instead, the Agency initiated several data collection activitiesto assess the problems posed by infectious waste management and disposal.EPA used the resulting information to develop a guidance document whichwas distributed to the public in draft form in 1982 outlining a practicalapproach for infectious waste management (47 FR 43162, September 30, 1982).The Agency then solicited comments on the draft guidance document, specificallyseeking advice from professionals in the health care industry. The textwas revised based on these comments and published in 1986 as a final guidancedocument, entitled <T3>EPA Guide for Infectious Waste Management. </T3>In addition to publishing the guidance document, the Agency has taken anactive role in training health care professionals in the responsible managementof infectious medical waste. Agency staff have participated as facultyor professional experts at symposia sponsored by the American HospitalAssociation and the American Society for Hospital Engineering. However, in 1987, several isolated incidents of improper management anddisposal of infectious wastes led to increased public concern about thepotential threat of these wastes to human health and the environment. Inresponse, the Agency convened a panel of experts in November 1987 to discussthe definition, proper management of, and risks posed by infectious wastes.On June 2, 1988, the Agency published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 20140), announcing the availability ofvarious documents and requesting public comments on five issues affectinginfectious waste management: the definition of infectious waste; the natureof infectious waste (risks and problems; the extent of mismanagement; pretreatmentand packaging, and disposal requirements); the role of EPA in infectiouswaste management; tracking of infectious waste; and exemptions from medicalwaste management controls. Although the passage of MWTA superceded manyaspects of the June 2 notice, EPA considered relevant comments receivedon the June 2 notice in developing today's rule.D. Consultation and Public Comment Because publication of a proposal for today's rule was not possible givenCongressional requirement that this program be expeditiously implemented,the Agency has made special efforts to coordinate the development and implementationof today's rule with interested parties. The Act specifically requiresEPA to consult with the affected States, and allows for consultation withother interested parties at EPA's discretion, in promulgating today's rule.Also, EPA was directed to consult with the International Joint Commission(IJC) to determine how to monitor the disposal of medical waste emanatingfrom Canada. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Consultation with States and Other Parties </ITAG>EPA began the consultation process by contacting virtually every Stateto obtain information on medical waste regulatory programs. EPA then concentratedon the ten States named in the Act, and developed a detailed summary ofthese States' medical waste regulations, both existing and proposed. (Seethe report entitled, ``State Medical Waste Regulatory Summary Report forMedical Waste Tracking Act States'' available in the docket.) EPA consideredthese regulations in developing the program promulgated today. EPA sponsored two meetings with the affected States to obtain input onthe interim final rule. EPA sponsored a meeting  in New York City on December14, 1988, with the States of Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York to solicittheir input in drafting the regulation. Then, on December 19 and 20, EPA,in conjunction with the National Governors' Association (NGA), sponsoreda two-day workshop in which representatives from the 10 affected States,plus the States of Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, North Carolina,and South Carolina, and from the Great Lakes Commission discussed regulatoryand implementation issues associated with today's Part 259 regulations.(<T3>See EPA/State Meeting to Consider Medical Waste Tracking RegulationIssues,</T3> available in the docket.) The Agency also sponsored a meeting on medical waste on November 14-16,1988, in Annapolis, Maryland. Over 50 individuals representing trade andprofessional associations, government agencies, several States, and otherorganizations attended the meeting. Comments and suggestions were solicitedfrom the participants concerning three major topic areas relevant to theMedical Waste Tracking Act of 1988: medical waste definitions; segregation,packaging, labeling, and tracking requirements; and information needs todevelop the Reports to Congress. The Agency compiled the comments and suggestionsfrom the meeting. (See ``Proceedings of the Meeting on Medical Waste''available in the docket for this rule.) All of these meetings providedinformation upon which this rule is based.In addition to these activities, the Agency met individually with appropriatestaff of several Federal agencies including the Department of Defense (DOD),the Veterans Administration (VA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH),the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the Department of Transportation(DOT) to obtain information on medical waste management practices. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Consultation with International Joint Commission </ITAG>In compliance with the requirements of the Medical Waste Tracking Act,EPA has initiated discussions with the International Joint Commission regardingthe development of the Agency's medical waste tracking program. EPA alsois working with the Canadian Government on the tracking of these wastes.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Future Agency Action </ITAG>A. Actions Under Other Agency ProgramsEPA's efforts on this rule represent only one phase of a multiphase programto investigate and address the medical waste problem. Other aspects ofthis program are described in Section VI. Another continuing effort with particular bearing on this rule is a studyof medical waste generation, treatment, transportation, and disposal inthe States of New Jersey and New York, which have been particularly affectedby medical waste mismanagement. Through a combination of site visits andsurveys, EPA is developing a baseline of information that will be usedlater in evaluating the effectiveness of the demonstration program. B. Reports to Congress In response to section 11008 of RCRA Subtitle J, and as discussed in sectionII.B. of this Preamble, EPA will develop three reports_two interim andone final_describing the extent of the medical waste management problem.These reports will provide Congress with an account of medical waste generation,management, potential for causing adverse health or environmental effects,costs, and the results of the demonstration program. This information isintended to aid Congress in determining the most appropriate course offuture action in this area. The interim reports are to be based on thebest information available to the Agency at the time of submission. Thefinal report will provide a thorough evaluation of the identified subjects.C. Regulatory Assessment Following the evaluation of the demonstration program and the completionof research for the reports to Congress, the Agency also will reassessthe need for regulation of medical waste on a national scale and identifyalternatives to national regulations. Currently, EPA is considering developingguidance for State legislative and regulatory programs for medical wasteas an alternative to national regulations. These programs could be adoptedin whole or in part by individual States, depending on the needs and resourcesof the States. These issues will be addressed in the context of the EPAreports to Congress. D. Educational Activities EPA has undertaken efforts that will enable the Agency and affected Statesto communicate the new requirements promulgated today to the regulatedcommunities within those States. EPA plans to sustain its educational effortsin these States throughout the duration of the demonstration program. Aspart of this endeavor, the Agency continues to recommend its 1986 <T3>EPA Guide for Infectious Waste Management </T3>both to health carefacilities outside the scope of the demonstration program, and as a supplementto today's regulations for health care facilities in the Covered States.Informational materials may be obtained by contacting the implementingState agency, or by calling the EPA RCRA Hotline at (800) 424-9346 or (202)382-3000. The <T3>EPA Guide for Infectious Waste Management </T3>is available for purchaseonly from the National Technical Information Service (telephone (703) 487-4650)as publication PB-86-199130. E. Program Evaluation Congress directed EPA to establish this system as a demonstration projectto determine whether such an approach would be an effective means of reducingbeach closings due to medical waste wash-ups. A critical element of theprogram consists of the evaluation necessary to determine if the approachmandated by the MWTA achieves the policy goals identified by Congress.In consultation with ATSDR, EPA will establish a baseline of existing disposalpractices; the incidences and causes of past beach closings; and the incidencesof recreational and occupational injuries caused by medical waste. Usingthis baseline, EPA will evaluate the program under the following criteria:andbullet; The effect on treatment and disposal practices, including thevolume of elicit disposal;andbullet; The effect on the number of beach closings;andbullet; Changes in aggregate health and environmental effects;andbullet; Changes in risks faced by health care providers, patients, andmedical waste handlers;andbullet; The effect on the cost of medical waste disposal; andandbullet; Covered States effectiveness in utilizing tracking system datato discover improper medical waste disposal. EPA requests comments on these criteria. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Overview of the Demonstration Program Tracking System </ITAG>As indicated above, the principal Congressional concern with medical wastewas the lack of any tracking mechanism. Thus the MWTA requires EPA to institutea tracking program that would provide assurance that medical wastes reachtheir proper destinations for disposal.EPA, for the purpose of these regulations, is using the term destinationfacility to signify the facility to which the medical waste is transportedfor proper disposal. Section 259.10(b) of today's rule defines a destinationfacility as a disposal facility including facilities that both treat anddestroy medical waste (e.g., off-site incinerators) which complete themedical waste tracking form by signing the form and sending a copy to theparty that initiated it, thus closing the chain-of-custody requirements.The framework Congress established does not provide for regulation of household-generatedmedical waste, but otherwise grants EPA authority to regulate medical wastegenerated in the Covered States, even when this waste is transported intonon-Covered States. Therefore, the regulations apply to generators in CoveredStates, and to transporters and owners and operators of transfer, treatment,and disposal facilities who accept or handle regulated medical waste generatedin one of the Covered States. The tracking system promulgated in today's rule will provide assurancesthat regulated medical waste is properly handled and managed from its pointof generation until it reaches the disposal facility. The tracking systemrequires each person in the chain-of-custody of medical waste managementto take responsibility for assuring that the waste reaches the proper treatmentor disposal facility. A tracking form must accompany the waste from generationto disposal or to treatment and destruction, thus leaving a paper trailwhich may identify sources of mismanagement. Exception and discrepancyreporting requirements are specified so that appropriate State and Federalofficials are notified if regulated medical wastes do not reach their designateddestination. Generators, transporters, treaters, and disposers are also required tokeep certain records that will aid in determining whether mismanagementof regulated medical waste has occurred. Additionally, today's rule establishessegregation and packaging standards to limit the possibility of exposureof waste handlers and the general public to regulated medical waste. Thisrule also requires that transporters submit periodic reports that EPA willuse to identify the generators of regulated medical waste, types and amountsof medical waste generated, current methods of medical waste management,and to obtain information on the number and identity of generators of lessthan 50 pounds per month of regulated medical waste. The Agency has determinedthat requiring transporters to submit such reports is the most effectivemeans of obtaining this information during a short demonstration programbecause of their central position within the medical waste management system,the fewer numbers of transporters relative to generators under this rule,and because transporters are more likely to already maintain such typesof information. The Agency has accelerated this rulemaking to ensure that the rule, consistentwith Congressional intent, is in place by this summer's beach season. Therule is issued in interim final form without prior notice and comment,as specifically authorized by Congress, because there is insufficient timeavailable to propose the regulation, accept comments, and promulgate itso that it becomes effective prior to the summer of 1989. In addition,EPA did not shorten the 90 day period between promulgation and the effectivedate of the program (as provided in section 11011) because EPA believesthat the regulated community will generally need the full 90-day periodin order to come into compliance with today's rule. For the same reasons,the Agency is extending the applicability of the consolidated rules ofpractice to administrative hearings for violations of the Act and regulations.The remainder of this section generally outlines the responsibilities ofeach person (i.e., the generator, transporter, and treatment or disposalfacility) in the management of regulated medical waste. As discussed inSection I of the Preamble, the general structure for the system is explainedin section 11003 of the Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988. The Act establishesthree performance standards for the tracking system. The program must:(1) Provide for tracking of the transportation of the waste from the generatorto the disposal facility with the exception of wastes that are incinerated(which need not be tracked after incineration); (2) Include a system for assuring the generator of the waste that the wasteis received by the disposal facility; and (3) Use a uniform form for tracking in each of the Covered States. Given this mandate, EPA looked to two primary sources for developing aFederal medical waste tracking program. First, the Agency examined theexisting Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest (UHWM) system under RCRA SubtitleC. In the UHWM system, a ``manifest'' functions as a shipping documentthat accompanies the waste from its point of generation to its ultimatedestination. The manifest provides a record for waste handlers (generators,transporters, and treatment and disposal facilities), documenting whenthe waste changes hands and if it has ultimately been delivered to a disposalfacility. Second, the legislative history indicates Congressional intent that EPAconsider New Jersey and New York tracking regulations as a model for theFederal program. Therefore, EPA also reviewed the emergency medical wastetracking programs currently being implemented in New Jersey and New York.Both States have instituted medical waste tracking programs similar tothe UHWM. Based on its analysis of these systems, the Agency concluded that a systemutilizing a tracking form would provide the most feasible means for monitoringthe movement of medical. waste from its point of generation to ultimatetreatment and destruction or disposal and that, given the relatively shorttime frame available, the system should be based in large part on the UHWM.Additionally, a tracking form system would be largely self-implementing;under this system, the generator would bear the responsibility for reportingany waste he ships off-site that does not actually arrive at the destinationtreatment and destruction facility or the disposal facility. The papertrail established through the use of a multiple-copy tracking form wouldconfirm the physical delivery of the waste to transporters and designateddisposers, thereby providing checks on the activities of all parties involved.Furthermore, reporting requirements associated with manifesting, such asexception and discrepancy reports, have been incorporated into the trackingsystem to alert the Agency to any anomalies that develop. Finally, theAgency incorporated many of the elements of the New Jersey and New Yorkprograms into the Federal medical waste tracking program. In particular,the Agency felt that the emergency manifest format used by New Jersey andNew York could be adapted readily to achieve the objectives of the Federalprogram; therefore, the New Jersey and New York form have been a basisfor the tracking form promulgated today. In summary, the Agency determined that the medical waste tracking systemoutlined in today's regulation should establish a system separate and distinctfrom the hazardous waste program, yet should incorporate several essentialelements of the UHWM system as well as significant portions of the NewJersey and New York State programs. This combination best meets the objectivesof the Medical Waste Tracking Act. The essential elements of the systemare discussed next.A. Uniform Tracking Form Section 11003 of the Medical Waste Tracking Act requires the Agency todevelop a uniform form for tracking to be used in each of the Covered States.The use of such a form will facilitate inspection and enforcement activitiesand the adoption of standard operating procedures for waste handlers. Section11007 stipulates that States or localities that require a tracking formfor waste subject to the Federal program must use a form identical to EPA's.States, however, may require additional information to be provided on aseparate attachment. Although the Agency initially considered adoptingthe Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest tracking form as the standard form,the Agency has determined that a unique tracking form would be more usefulfor the medical waste tracking program. Several factors contributed tothis decision: (1) The legislative history indicates that the Agency, to the extent possible,should avoid disrupting either New Jersey's or New York's emergency medicalwaste tracking programs. These programs do not utilize the UHWM trackingform. While the Agency recognizes that the form promulgated in today'srule also varies slightly from the State forms, EPA engaged in extensiveconsultations with the two States and, ultimately, the States and EPA agreedthat the form issued today is appropriate for the Federal program; (2) The health care industry generally believes that the information requirements(e.g., DOT shipping description) of the existing hazardous waste manifestare not appropriate; (3) Most generators of regulated medical waste subject to the medical wastetracking form requirements do not have an EPA Hazardous Waste identification(ID) number, which is required for the UHWM, and it would be very difficultto establish an ID system for the estimated 150,000 medical waste generatorssubject to this rule; (4) Because of the special information needs for medical waste tracking,the Agency would need to develop a new set of instructions for completingthe UHWM when it is utilized for tracking regulated medical waste. A newset of instructions for completing this manifest for regulated medicalwaste is likely to create confusion for those persons transporting anddisposing of RCRA hazardous wastes. The potential for confusion may alsobe exacerbated by the short duration and limited scope (i.e., waste generatedin Covered States only) of this program; (5) In most States and under RCRA, medical waste need not be disposed ofin RCRA Subtitle C facilities. However, because transporters and disposalfacility owners and operators have been trained that waste shipments accompaniedby a UHWM may be disposed of only in a RCRA Subtitle C facility, use ofthe UHWM may create confusion over where medical waste may be disposedor treated. As a result, disposal or treatment facilities might rejectmedical waste accompanied by the Subtitle C manifest. At the same time,because waste accompanied by the UHWM would no longer be restricted toSubtitle C facilities, some hazardous waste may be diverted to generalsolid waste facilities. Ultimately, the medical waste tracking system must provide the necessarypaper trail to meet the objectives of the demonstration tracking programwhile, at the same time, being easy to implement by the regulated community.The Agency requests comments as to whether another tracking system or trackingform is more appropriate than the distinct Medical Waste Tracking Formthat has been developed for the Federal demonstration program. For example,the Agency requests comments on whether advance notice of tracking shouldbe required of generators so that a treatment or disposal facility wouldbe notified to expect delivery of regulated medical waste in advance ofthe waste's arrival. B. How the Tracking System Operates Under the medical waste tracking system, the tracking form serves as ashipping document and as a record that will verify the movement and dispositionof regulated medical waste following its generation. Each party (i.e.,generator, transporter, and treatment and disposal facility) who handlesregulated medical waste has responsibilities to make certain that the wasteis properly managed. The following paragraphs identify the general responsibilitiesof each party. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Generator Responsibilities </ITAG>a. <T3>Generators of 50 pounds or more per month. </T3>Today's rule requiresgenerators in the Covered States who generate 50 pounds or more of regulatedmedical waste in a calendar month to complete a tracking form for eachshipment of regulated medical waste intended for off-site treatment ordisposal. The tracking form must be prepared by the generator when regulated medicalwaste is transported or offered for transport off-site (i.e., when thegenerator turns waste over to a transporter for delivery to an off-sitetreatment and destruction or disposal facility). The generator must obtaina copy of the medical waste tracking form (see the acquisition of manifestdiscussion in the section-by-section analysis that follows), complete theform according to the instructions provided in Appendix I to Part 259,and sign and date the tracking form certification by hand. The generatoralso must make certain that the regulated medical waste is properly segregated,packaged, labeled, and marked. Before releasing custody of the waste tothe transporter, he must obtain the signature of the transporter and thedate of acceptance on all copies of the tracking form. The generator mustretain a copy of the tracking form for his records and give the remainingcopies of the tracking form to the initial transporter. The generator alsoshould receive a copy of the form back from the disposal facility within35 days. The generator must file an exception report with the RegionalAdministrator and the State if he does not receive the copy within 45 daysfrom the initial date of acceptance by the transporter. b. <T3>Generators of less than 50 pounds per month. </T3>In many cases, verysmall volumes of medical waste have been responsible for extensive publicconcern. Due to the potential adverse effects that could be caused by mismanagement,the Agency decided not to exempt generators of small amounts of regulatedmedical waste from all aspects of the program. However, as provided bythe statute, today's rule exempts generators of less than 50 pounds ofregulated medical waste per calendar month from preparing a tracking form,unless they ship an individual shipment of 50 pounds or more. Such generators,however, still are required to maintain logs recording each of their shipmentsof less than 50 pounds. In addition, EPA has determined that proper packagingof regulated medical waste is necessary to ensure proper containment ofthe waste and to protect waste handlers and the public from exposure tothese materials. Labeling and marking are directly related to the trackingrequirements because the transporters are initiating forms for these wastes,and other waste handlers must be able to identify the contents as regulatedmedical waste. The Agency, therefore, has not exempted these generatorsfrom the requirements to properly package, label, mark and transport theirwaste in accordance with today's regulations.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Transporter and Transfer Facility Responsibilities </ITAG>a. <T3>General. </T3>Transporters, including transporters who operate transferfacilities, must be authorized through a notification process to transportand/or operate in a Covered State. (The notification procedures are explainedin Subsection V.) After submitting notification, the transporter may acceptregulated medical waste for transport. Before accepting any shipment ofregulated medical waste, however, the transporter must verify that allthe information required on the tracking form is complete and that theregulated medical waste is properly packaged, labeled, and marked. Thetransporter then must sign and date the medical waste tracking form certifyinghis acceptance of the shipment from the generator, and return a copy ofthe form to the generator. The transporter then must carry the tracking document and the associatedmedical waste to the destination facility or to the next transporter ofthe waste. If delivery to the next transporter or destination facilityis not possible, the transporter must contact the generator for furtherinstructions, note such instructions in the space provided on the formfor additional information, and carry out those instructions consistentwith applicable law. Until the signature of the destination facility orsubsequent transporter is obtained, the waste is considered to be in thecustody of the transporter who last signed the tracking form. b. <T3>Consolidation or remanifesting of regulated medical waste. </T3>Undertoday's rule, certain transporters and owners or operators of transferfacilities must initiate tracking forms. A transporter who receives oneor more individual shipments from generators of less than 50 pounds permonth of regulated medical waste that are not accompanied by a trackingform must initiate the form. The transporter is also required to consolidateall such shipments onto a single tracking form. As noted in the section-by-sectionanalysis, transporters and owners or operators of transfer facilities willbe required to attach a separate sheet of paper or log to the trackingform that identifies each generator and the amount of corresponding wastethat has been consolidated onto the tracking form. The Agency also is allowing transporters and owners or operators of transferfacilities to consolidate or remanifest individual shipments of regulatedmedical waste weighing less than 220 pounds onto a single tracking form.The Agency believes that the tracking program would become unimplementableif treatment and disposal facility operators were required to sign andaccount for a tracking form for each and every generator, including generatorsof less than 50 pounds, of regulated medical waste (e.g., a single truckcould contain as many as 500 individual shipments of regulated medicalwaste, each weighing 100 pounds or less). However, to facilitate recordkeepingby transporters, EPA recommends that shipments between 50 and 220 poundsaccompanied by a tracking form <T3>not </T3>be consolidated with shipments of less than 50 pounds fromgenerators exempt from use of the tracking form. To simplify recordkeepingprocedures, EPA believes that shipments between 50 and 220 pounds shouldbe consolidated onto a single tracking form while shipments of less than50 pounds from generators exempt from use of the tracking form should beconsolidated onto a second, separate tracking form. Today's rule also requires that transporters (including owners or operatorsof transfer facilities) maintain copies of all tracking forms for a periodof three (3) years. Transporters must submit periodic reports to the Stateand to EPA summarizing waste quantity information (generation and destination).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Treatment and Disposal Facility Responsibilities </ITAG>a. <T3>General. </T3>When regulated medical waste is delivered to the destinationfacility, the owner or operator of the facility must sign and date thetracking form to certify that the regulated medical waste was received.The owner or operator also must note discrepancies such as differencesin the quantity or type of waste identified on the tracking form and thequantity or type of waste actually received at the facility. When suchdiscrepancies cannot be resolved with the generator and transporters, theowner or operator must notify appropriate State and EPA officials. After acceptance, the owner or operator must send a copy of the signedtracking form to the generator within 15 days of delivery. This representsthe final segment of the tracking loop. It signifies to the generator thathis waste has been received by the destination facility. b. <T3>Treatment or destruction facilities initiating tracking forms. </T3>Anowner or operator of a treatment facility must initiate a tracking formwhen the waste has been treated, but has not been destroyed through suchprocesses as grinding or shredding. Similarly when waste has been eithershredded or ground but not treated the facility must initiate a trackingform. The waste thus still requires transport to a final disposal site.Specific instructions for dealing with this situation are included nextin the detailed section-by-section analysis. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Analysis of the Rule_Part 259 Standard for the Tracking and Managementof Medical Waste </ITAG>The previous section explained the general operation of the demonstrationtracking program, as well as the basic responsibilities of each individualinvolved in the generation, transport, and treatment and disposal of regulatedmedical waste. The paragraphs that follow provide a detailed section-by-sectionanalysis of the rule, discussing the rationale behind the requirements,and providing guidance for interpreting various sections of the rule. Thosesections of the rule that are self-explanatory are not addressed in thePreamble.A. Subpart A_General Subpart A of today's rule provides general information on the new Part259. This section of the Preamble deals with three issues concerning theprogram's scope and applicability: the limitation of the program to medicalwaste generated within the Covered States; effective dates and durationof the program; and notification to EPA by the State when taking enforcementactions. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Waste Generated in a Covered State (Section 259.10) </ITAG>Section V.C. of this Preamble discusses how States may petition in or optout of the demonstration program. States that are in the program are referredto as ``Covered States'' (see RCRA section 11001). Other States are referredto as ``non-Covered States.'' RCRA section 11003(a) requires EPA to establisha demonstration tracking program for listed medical wastes generated ina Covered State. The tracking program applies to such waste, generatedin a Covered State, from its point of generation to its final destinationeven if that destination is in a non-Covered State; however, these requirementsdo not apply to wastes shipped from a non-Covered State to a Covered State,as discussed below. (Shipments into a foreign country are discussed inSection V.H. of this Preamble.) The Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 (MWTA) provides authority to establisha demonstration tracking program based on the type of waste being managedand the fact that the waste has been generated in a Covered State. In lightof the common practice of interstate transport and disposal of medicalwaste, Congress provided this authority in order to ensure that such wastescan be tracked to their point of disposal or point of treatment and destruction(<T3>e.g., </T3>incineration), regardless of whether that destination iswithin a Covered State. No limitation on this authority exists specifyingthat the waste must be generated and disposed of in a Covered State. Infact, Congress amended the original Senate medical waste tracking billthat did limit the program to waste generated and disposed of in a CoveredState. Thus, the statutory basis for the scope of the demonstration programis tied to the waste at issue and is based on such waste meeting two conditions:(1) The waste must be listed by EPA under section 11002, and (2) such wastemust be generated in a Covered State. Where these two conditions are satisfied,all persons or facilities handling such waste are subject to the demonstrationprogram requirements. This includes transporters or facilities locatedin non-Covered States if they receive regulated medical waste generatedin Covered States. Accordingly, while the generator requirements for the tracking programare limited to persons located in Covered States, requirements for transportersand for owners or operators of treatment or disposal facilities apply toany person handling medical waste from a generator in those Covered States,even if the transportation, treatment, or disposal does not occur in aCovered State. Hence, owners and operators of treatment or disposal facilitiesoperating in non-Covered States will still be responsible under today'srule for returning tracking forms to generators in Covered States, thusmaintaining the integrity of the tracking program (see andSection; 259.1(c)).As discussed above, Congress clearly intended the program to apply to themanagement of medical wastes generated in Covered States wherever thatactivity occurs. It is also clear that medical waste which meets one ofthe EPA listing descriptions and was generated outside a Covered State,but transported into or through a Covered State, is not regulated underthe demonstration program. Therefore, there is a need to identify the geographicorigin of a particular shipment of medical waste in order to determinewhether regulatory requirements apply. This raises enforcement and implementationproblems with respect to waste found in a Covered State, but which is claimedto be generated in a non-Covered State and thus is not regulated. EPA hasaddressed this problem in andSection; 259.1(d), which states that any regulatedmedical waste that is transported or otherwise managed within the boundariesof a Covered State will be presumed to have been generated in the CoveredState and thus subject to all applicable tracking requirements. This presumptionmay be rebutted by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that thewaste in question was generated outside the Covered State. The burden ison the regulated party to rebut the presumption. EPA believes the presumption made in andSection; 259.1(d) is necessary toallow effective implementation of the demonstration program. Precedentfor such a presumption is found under other RCRA regulations (<T3>e.g., </T3>40 CFR 261.2 for recycled material). The presumption isbased on the rationale that, since medical waste is generated in all ofthe Covered States, the physical presence of medical waste in a CoveredState is a fairly reliable indication that the waste was generated in thatState. EPA recognizes that there will be exceptions, but believes thatthe burden of demonstrating the origin of the waste should be placed onthe persons managing the medical waste. <T3>Id. </T3>Moreover, providing appropriate documentation should not be difficult.First, under current industry practices, medical wastes shipped out ofState are accompanied by shipping papers. Second, many States not participatingin the demonstration program are nonetheless implementing their own medicalwaste programs, which often include a requirement for manifesting or trackingthe medical waste. In either case, easily accessible and sufficient documentationwill be available to substantiate the claim of nonregulated status. Theperson claiming nonregulated status, however, bears the burden of proofin any enforcement action. Comments are requested on this presumption and on alternative ways in whichthe Agency could implement the distinction between waste generated in aCovered State and waste generated in a non-Covered State. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Effective Dates and Duration of the Program (Section 259.2) </ITAG>Congress specified that the demonstration program would be in place for24 months, beginning on the effective date of the EPA regulations (seeRCRA Section 11001(d)) and that EPA's regulations would generally takeeffect 90 days after promulgation. (See RCRA section 11011.) The regulationspromulgated today will take effect and become enforceable on June 22, 1989.This is the full 90-day period authorized under RCRA Section 11011. AlthoughNew Jersey and New York currently are operating under programs quite similarto the rules promulgated today, the Agency believes the regulated communitiesin those States also will need the full 90 days to implement the medicaltracking form and reach compliance. Therefore, the demonstration programwill expire on June 22, 1991, for all waste generated in Covered States.Enforcement actions, however, may be initiated after the expiration dateto address violations occurring during the demonstration program.B. Subpart B_Definitions Today's rule includes a list of terms that have been defined specificallyto address the management of medical waste. These definitions are includedin Subpart B of the rule (andSection; 259.10). Certain definitions from 40CFR 260.10, applicable to hazardous waste management, have been incorporatedby reference. Other terms used in the hazardous waste regulations, anddefined in andSection; 260.10, have been redefined in andSection; 259.10(a)for use in the medical waste management regulations. Finally, terms thatare unique to the medical waste management regulations are defined in andSection;259.10(b). For three defined terms, ``facility,'' ``transporter,'' and ``landfill,''the only change from the definition in andSection; 260.10 is the substitutionof the words ``medical waste'' for the words ``hazardous waste'' in theSubtitle C definition. This is necessary for the obvious reason that today'srule addresses medical waste and not hazardous waste. Three other termslisted in andSection; 259.10(a); (``storage,'' ``treatment,'' and ``generator'')also replace the words ``hazardous waste'' with the words ``medical waste;''however, the definitions of these terms in andSection; 259.10 also includeother changes from the existing andSection; 260.10 definitions. These additionalchanges are indicated and explained below. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Storage </ITAG>The definition of storage in andSection; 259.10(a) differs slightly fromthe definition of storage in andSection; 260.10. Today's rule specifies thatstorage is the temporary holding of medical waste at a central collectionpoint, whereas the definition in andSection; 260.10 defines storage as thetemporary holding of waste prior to treatment, disposal, or transport elsewhere.This distinction is intended to clarify that medical waste storage is consideredto be those instances where waste is held at a generator's facility whereit is accumulated in the normal course of business prior to packaging,transport, treatment, or disposal (e.g., near a loading dock). It is alsointended to clarify that the temporary holding of medical waste, for instanceduring brief periods for collection (e.g., at a nurses station in the pediatricward), is not intended to constitute storage or subject the temporary accumulationarea to applicable storage requirements. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Treatment </ITAG>Treatment also is defined in today's rule in a different manner than itis defined in andSection; 260.10. Under today's rule, treatment includesany method, technique, or process designed to change the biological characteror composition of any medical waste so as to reduce or eliminate its potentialfor causing disease. This definition differs from the Subtitle C definitionin that changes to the physical or chemical character of medical wastewhich also affect the infectious nature of the waste are not consideredtreatment; rather, the focus of treatment is to reduce or eliminate theinfectious biological character of the waste. Thus, the definition in today'srule emphasizes treatment of the biological hazard. (The definition isthe same as that in the 1986 <T3>EPA Guide for Infectious Waste Management.</T3>) Treatment as defined under today's rule is intended to encompass thoseprocesses, including thermal treatment (such as incineration), steam sterilization,and other treatment techniques (e.g., chemical treatment), that are generallyeffective in reducing or eliminating the infectious risk posed by thesewastes. New technologies capable of rendering medical waste innocuous wouldalso fall within this definition. Finally, the reader should note thatthe discussion above pertains to <T3>waste </T3>treatment. As discussed in a later section of the Preamble,the definition of medical waste also uses the term ``treatment'' but inthat context the term refers to <T3>patient </T3>treatment (e.g., the provision of health care services).The regulatory definition of ``treatment'' also incorporates this distinction.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Generator </ITAG>Generator, as used in today's rule, is intended to include any person,by site, whose act or process produces a regulated medical waste or whoseact first causes a medical waste to be subject to this regulation. Twokey aspects of this definition warrant emphasis. First, person, as definedunder andSection; 259.10, includes any individual, trust, firm, joint stockcompany, corporation (including a government corporation), partnership,association, State, municipality, commission, political subdivision ofa State, any interstate body, or any department, agency or instrumentalityof the United States. This definition is intended to include any form ofbusiness entity and to incorporate the Act's revision of the RCRA definitionof ``person'' under section 11006(b) (Federal Facilities). Second, personsare evaluated by site to determine who satisfies the definition of a generator.Thus, each individual generation site, such as a hospital located on acontiguous piece of property, is an individual generator; however, a hospitalwhich has four (4) noncontiguous pieces of property on which medical wasteis generated, has four (4) generation sites, one on each piece of property,and each site is a generator. In contrast, several ``persons'' (for instance,independent, private practitioners) located in the same building are eachseparate generators, because the definition of generator is a ``person,by site.'' In addition to the terms defined in andSection; 259.10(a) of Subpart B, severalnew terms have been defined in andSection; 259.10(b). These terms are discussedbelow, as they are used in the regulations. C. Subpart C_Covered States When amending RCRA to establish the demonstration tracking progran formedical waste, Congress directed that the effort cover 10 specific States.However, the legislation also contains provisions for allowing these Statesto withdraw from participation in the program and for other States to jointhe effort. Congress provided that the Governors of the States be given30 days from the promulgation date of these provisions to make decisionsregarding their participation. This discussion elaborates on the processfor petitioning in and opting out of the demonstration program. EPA hasmade special efforts, including working with the National Governors' Association,to provide Covered States and States interested in participating in thedemonstration program with information concerning the program. Once the 30-day opt-out/petition in period has expired, EPA will not addadditional States or consider petitions to delete States from the demonstrationprogram. Furthermore, persons who generate or manage medical waste in CoveredStates that do not opt out will be subject to the program for its 24-monthduration as required by section 11001(d). The procedures for States toopt out or petition into the program are discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York </ITAG>Because improper medical waste disposal incidents on the East Coast havearisen most visibly, Congress conditioned the opting out by three specifiedStates_Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York_on a showing that their respectiveState medical waste tracking programs are no less stringent than the Federaldemonstration program. Therefore, if any of these three States requestnot to participate, EPA will evaluate that State's program elements todetermine whether or not they are at least as stringent as the Federalprogram. In the absence of specific Congressional direction regarding therequirement that these States' programs be ``no less stringent'' than theFederal program, EPA intends to use the existing RCRA Subtitle C Stateauthorization criteria as guidance (see 40 CFR Part 271). Under the SubtitleC process, the State's program requirements are generally compared to theFederal requirements item-by-item. If EPA determines that the State's programis no less stringent as the program promulgated today, the Agency willrevise today's interim final rule by amending Part 259 to remove that Statefrom the Covered States list. If the State's program is not found to meetthe no less stringent standard, the State will remain in the Federal program.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Great Lakes States </ITAG>Congress also directed that seven States contiguous to the Great Lakes(Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin)be subject to the demonstration program, unless the Governors of such Statesnotify EPA in writing within 30 days of promulgation that they have chosennot to participate. Congress did not establish a ``no less stringent''standard for these States. EPA will identify those States that elect toopt out in a later <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Other States </ITAG>States not mentioned above may elect to participate in the demonstrationprogram. The Governor of a State electing to participate must petitionEPA by April 24, 1989 to be included on the list of Covered States. Thedefinition of ``State'' in RCRA section 1004(31) includes the several States,the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa,Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. EPA interpretsthe term ``Governor'' to include the Governor in any of the several States,or the equivalent head of the executive branch of the government for thoseother governmental entities. The Act specifies that EPA must determinewhether to include a petitioning State in the program within 30 days ofreceipt of the petition (RCRA section 11001(c)). American Samoa has alreadypetitioned to be included in the program, and EPA will make a determinationregarding American Samoa and any other petition-in States after the 30day period. The Agency is planning to publish the final list of Covered States in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>shortly after the April 24, 1989, opt-out/petition-indeadline. D. Subpart D_Regulated Medical Waste Section 11002 of RCRA requires EPA to develop and promulgate a list ofmedical wastes to be tracked under the demonstration progran. The statuteprovides the basic components of the list by identifying five waste typesthat must be included: (1) Cultures and stocks of infectious agents andassociated biologicals; (2) pathological waste; (3) human blood and bloodproducts; (4) used sharps (e.g., syringes, needles, and surgical blades);and (5) contaminated animal carcasses. The statute also identifies fiveadditional waste types that EPA is authorized to exclude from the demonstrationprogram if the Agency determines that mismanagement of such wastes wouldnot pose a substantial threat to human health or the environment; (6) surgeryor autopsy waste; (7) laboratory wastes; (8) dialysis wastes; (9) discardedmedical equipment; and (10) isolation wastes. The Act also gives EPA authorityto add other medical wastes to the list if the Agency determines that suchwastes may pose a substantial threat to human health or the environment.The Act's designation of two different ``universes'' of medical waste originates,in part, from EPA's <T3>Guide for Infectious Waste Management </T3>(1986). In that document,the Agency identified two universes of medical waste: ``infectious'' medicalwaste and ``miscellaneous contaminated wastes.'' The first universe, ``infectious''medical wastes, included those wastes listed in the Act as waste typesl, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10. The Agency, at the time, believed that all of thesewastes should be specially managed. The second universe included thosewastes listed in the Act as waste types 6, 7, 8, and 9. EPA recognizedthat, depending on the specific characteristics of the ``miscellaneouscontaminated wastes,'' they could be handled appropriately as ``infectious''medical wastes or noninfectious medical wastes based on the determinationof a responsible infection control practitioner. Clearly, one of the most controversial aspects of EPA's guidance documenthas been its inclusion of isolation wastes (waste type 10 in the Act) inthe first universe of ``infectious'' medical wastes. The health care community,medical professionals, and public health officials have strongly criticizedthis aspect of the guidance document stating that, except under specialcircumstances, isolation wastes are unlikely to pose a significant hazardto human health or the environment. Thus, EPA believes that Congress, informulating the statutory list of medical wastes subject to the demonstrationprogram, relied on the basic format of the original waste listing as setforth in the 1986 guidance document (i.e., separating the universe of medicalwaste into ``infectious'' and ``miscellaneous contaminated waste'' categories).However, EPA also believes that Congress concurred with prevailing scientificopinion concerning the relative threat posed by isolation patient waste(listed in the EPA guidance document as an infectious waste category) anddesignated this as a category that the Administrator may exclude from thedemonstration program based on the authority of section 11002(b). In today's rule, medical wastes to be tracked under the demonstration programare referred to as ``regulated medical waste.'' Regulated medical wasteis a subset of medical waste which, in turn, is a subset of ``solid waste''as defined in RCRA section 1004. This relationship is illustrated in Figure1. The term ``regulated medical waste'' includes the list of medical wastes,as determined by EPA, and certain mixtures of these wastes with other typesof wastes. This section of the Preamble discusses the criteria used todefine or designate medical waste as ``regulated medical waste,'' explainsthe content and rationale behind the regulatory listing of regulated medicalwaste, and describes the conditions under which waste classes may be exemptedfrom regulation.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 62</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Definition of Solid Waste </ITAG>Solid waste, as defined in section 1004 of RCRA, includes discarded solid,liquid, semisolid, or contained gaseous material, among other materials.Specifically excluded from the meaning of the term ``solid waste'' is domesticsewage, because Congress did not intend for materials that are legallydischarged to sewers to be regulated under RCRA. Such discharge is subjectto the Clean Water Act and also may be subject to State and local controls.Similarly, materials which health care facilities discharge to sewers flowingto a publicly owned treatment works (POTW) are not ``solid waste'' andare not subject to the demonstration program. For purposes of the demonstrationprogram, the term ``domestic sewage'' has the same specific meaning asin the Subtitle C (hazardous waste management) program (i.e., untreatedsanitary wastes and other materials which flow through a sewer system toa POTW). See 40 CFR 26l.4(a)(1). <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Definition of Medical Waste </ITAG>Medical waste is a subset of solid waste. Section 1004(40) of RCRA, asamended by the MWTA, defines medical waste as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the term ``medicalwaste'' means any solid waste which is generated in the diagnosis, treatment,or immunization of human beings or animals, in research pertaining thereto,or in the production or testing of biologicals. The term does not includeany hazardous waste identified or listed under Subtitle C or any householdwaste as defined in regulations under Subtitle C.</ITAG>Following is EPA's interpretation of this definition. a. <T3>General.</T3> EPA interprets ``diagnosis, treatment, or immunization''to include waste generated during the provision of medical services suchas surgery, dialysis, obstetrical procedures, routine checkups, and healthmaintenance activities. (Treatment in the statutory definition refers tothe provision of patient care; EPA also interprets treatment to mean thepreparation of human and animal remains before interment or cremation.Treatment when used in the context of medical waste management means toreduce or eliminate a medical waste's disease-causing potential.) However,EPA does not interpret ``medical waste'' to include waste generated asa result of activities ancillary to patient care, such as general refusefrom administrative offices, or cafeteria waste. Solid waste generated during ``research pertaining to'' the diagnosis,treatment, or immunization of humans or animals is ``medical waste'' ifit results from one of the following practices: (1) Diagnosis research_wastegenerated by facilities engaged in pathology research, the developmentof diagnostic procedures, and the evaluation of health effects of variouspharmaceuticals and chemicals; and (2) Treatment research_waste generatedduring research pertaining to the treatment of patients and in the evaluationof the effectiveness of such treatment; and (3) Immunization research_wastegenerated during research pertaining to the development of new or improvedvaccines, evaluation of the effectiveness of the vaccines, or in the developmentand evaluation of immunization techniques. Biotechnology wastes are medicalwastes only if the end-product is a biological intended for use in diagnosing,immunizing, or treating humans or animals or in research pertaining tothese activities. Solid waste that is generated as a result of biotechnologyactivities producing microorganisms for pesticide or industrial applications(e.g., mineral extraction, oil recovery, chemical production, and chemicaldegradation) is not medical waste and is, therefore, not subject to therequirements of the demonstration program. In summary, EPA interprets the universe of medical waste generators toinclude, but not be limited to, hospitals, physicians' offices, dentaloffices, veterinary practices, funeral homes, research laboratories thatperform health-related analyses or services, nursing homes, and hospices.However, as discussed later in this section, only a portion of the medicalwaste generated by these facilities is ``regulated medical waste'' andthus subject to the demonstration program. b. <T3>Exclusions. </T3>In developing this definition, Congress determinedthat both hazardous waste and household waste (as defined under the SubtitleC regulations, 40 CFR 261.4(b)(1)) should not be regulated under the demonstrationprogram and, thus, specifically excluded them from the meaning of medicalwaste in the statutory definition (section 1004(40) of RCRA). The terms``hazardous waste'' and ``household waste'' have specific meanings in theSubtitle C (hazardous waste management) program (see 40 CFR Part 261).For purposes of the demonstration program, they retain those meanings.Hazardous waste listed or identified in 40 CFR Part 261 is not ``medicalwaste'' but may be subject to Part 259 requirements when mixed with regulatedmedical waste. EPA interprets the term ``hazardous waste identified orlisted under Subtitle C'' to include any hazardous waste as generated.Accordingly, mixtures of hazardous waste and medical waste are not excludedfrom the definition of ``medical waste'' by virtue of the hazardous wastemixture rule (40 CFR 261.3). Under today's regulation, only mixtures ofhazardous waste and medical waste that are subject to the Subtitle C manifestrequirements are excluded from Part 259 requirements. Mixtures of hazardouswaste and medical waste are discussed later in this Preamble section. Household waste, as defined in the Subtitle C regulations (40 CFR 261.4(b)),is not medical waste, and is not subject to the requirements of the demonstrationprogram. The Agency has stated that the exclusion is limited to waste generatedby individuals on the premises of a residence for individuals and composedprimarily of materials found in waste generated by consumers in their homes.49 FR 44978 (November 13, 1984). Thus, if the waste is domestic waste generatedat a residence, it is ``household waste'' and thus excluded from this program.As a result, the wastes generated by health care providers in private homeswhere they provide medical services to individuals would be ``householdwaste.'' Because the household <T3>wastestream </T3>is excluded, the waste generated by the health careprovider in private homes would not be subject to the tracking or managementrequirements even when removed from the home and transported to the physician'splace of business. Although the Agency believes that nursing homes are ``residential'' insome ways, their primary purpose is the provision of health care services.Because such facilities are primarily for the purpose of providing healthcare and, like a hospital, the residential aspects are a necessary incidentof the health care, and because such facilities are expected to generateamounts and types of medical waste significantly different from waste generatedby consumers in their homes, such wastes are not considered ``householdwaste'' under andSection; 261.4, and must be managed as regulated medicalwaste. EPA will be studying the effects of this household waste exclusionas part of its Report to Congress under section 11008, and will considerregulatory and nonregulatory options for dealing with any mismanagementproblems associated with such waste. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Definition of Regulated Medical Waste </ITAG>Regulated medical waste is medical waste that has not been specificallyexcluded in the provisions and is either (a) a listed medical waste, or(b) a mixture of a listed medical waste and a solid waste. EPA has listedseven (7) classes of medical waste that must be tracked under the demonstrationprogram and has described the items included in each class. The regulateditems have been grouped by waste class so that generators can easily identifythose wastes that are subject to the tracking requirements. Today's rule requires these substances to be tracked under the demonstrationprogram only if they are waste materials and are being shipped off-sitefor treatment or disposal. When these substances are being transportedfrom site to site for analysis or as a commercial product (e.g., pathologicalspecimens or blood), they are not subject to the requirements of the demonstrationprogram, as a result of that shipment, because they are not waste materials.However, if these materials become waste and they meet the definition ofregulated medical waste, they will be subject to these regulations if generatedin a Covered State. Of the seven (7) waste classes listed below, the first six parallel six(6) of the first 10 waste types identified in section 11002 of the statute.The seventh has been added by EPA under the authority of section 11002(a)(11).The descriptions for each of the first six (6) waste classes presentedin Subpart D of today's rule are based on EPA's interpretation of the statuteand the authority provided in section 11002(b) and section 11002(a)(11).The remainder of this section discusses each class of regulated medicalwaste and explains EPA's interpretations regarding the items included ineach class. EPA based these descriptions, in part, on discussions heldduring meetings with various representatives of the health care and solidwaste management communities on November 14-16, 1988, and with State representativeson December 19 and 20, 1988. a. <T3>Class 1_Cultures and stocks. </T3>EPA includes, within this class,those wastes (cultures and stocks of infectious agents) meeting the statutorydescription of section 11002(a)(1), described below:<ITAG tagnum="21">Cultures and stocks of infectious agents and associated biologicals,including: cultures from medical and pathological laboratories; culturesand stocks of infectious agents from research and industrial laboratories;wastes from the production of biologicals; discarded live and attenuatedvaccines; and culture dishes and devices used to transfer, inoculate, andmix cultures.</ITAG>As guidance in determining what ``infectious agents'' are, those agentslisted in Classes 2 through 4 of the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC's)<T3>Classification of Etiologic Agents on the Basis of Hazard </T3>(July,1974) would be included. EPA believes that these guidelines are suitableto indicate which medical wastes warrant regulation. Also, EPA has interpretedthe term ``biological'' to mean preparations made from organisms, or fromproducts of their metabolism, intended for use in diagnosing, immunizing,or treating humans or animals, or in research pertaining thereto. See thedefinition in andSection; 259.10. EPA notes that under the definition of``infectious agents'' and ``biologicals,'' agents that cause disease innon-human animals, but not in humans, are not covered under this class,however, agents that cause disease in both humans and non-human animalsare covered. The main concern with this class is potential hazard to humanhealth. Examples of wastes that may fall in this category include cultures of medicalspecimens, stocks of infectious agents used to produce vaccines, vaccinesthat are off-specification, culture dishes, and swabs used to inoculatecultures. b. <T3>Class 2_Pathological wastes. </T3>EPA's regulatory description of Class2 is based on the language in the section 11002(a)(2) definition, and readsas follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Human pathological wastes, including tissues, organs, body parts,and body fluids that are removed during surgery or autopsy, or other medicalprocedures, and specimens of body fluids and their containers.</ITAG>As described above, the pathological waste class includes wastes of humanorigin only. Thus, except for those specific animal wastes included inClasses 5 and 6, described below, and except for certain items that meetthe conditions of waste Class 1, pathological wastes from veterinary practicesare specifically excluded from regulation under this part. As explainedpreviously, the 10 medical waste types listed in the Act are virtuallyidentical to the infectious medical wastes identified in the 1986 EPA Guidefor Infectious Waste Management. However, the guidance was intended toinclude only human pathological wastes, and thus all examples of pathologicalwaste in the guidance are of human origin. Although the statute and legislativehistory are unclear as to whether Congress intended to include all pathologicalwaste, under this class, EPA believes Congress intended to include thesame wastes that were included in the <T3>EPA Guide for Infectious Waste Management. </T3>Thus, EPA interpretsthe Act to include pathological wastes of human origin only. While EPA is aware that some arguments can be made that animal pathologicalwastes should be included in Class 2 (e.g., it may be difficult, in somecases, to distinguish between human and animal pathological wastes), animalwastes that are known to be contaminated and thus potentially harmful tohuman health are already regulated under waste Class 5. Other animal wastesare regulated under Class 6. For all of the above reasons, the Agency hasdetermined that waste Class 2, pathological waste, should include wastesof human origin only. The Agency requests specific comments on this decision.EPA has added the phrase, ``other medical procedures,'' to account forpathological wastes generated from procedures not normally considered surgery(e.g., obstetrical procedures). Also being included under this waste classare discarded body fluids and discarded specimens of body fluids and theircontainers. These are included at the recommendation of health professionalswho regard the potential for causing health effects posed by such fluidsto be the same as for other pathological wastes.c. <T3>Class 3_Human blood and blood products. </T3>The regulatory descriptionof Class 3 is based on section 11002(a)(3). Class 3 includes:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) <T3>Liquid </T3>waste human blood; (2) products of blood; (3) <T3>items saturated and/or dripping with human blood; </T3>or (4) <T3>items that were saturated and/or dripping with human blood that arenow caked with dried human blood; </T3>including serum, plasma, and otherblood components, <T3>and their containers, which were used or intended for use in eitherpatient care, testing and laboratory analysis, or the development of pharmaceuticals.Intravenous bags are also included in this category.</T3></ITAG>This waste class covers bulk waste human blood and products derived fromblood, such as discarded units of blood and other licensed blood products.EPA has also included in this class the containers used to hold blood (e.g.,blood bags and blood vials) because these containers may be contaminatedby blood, and thus present the same hazards as the blood itself. In addition,the mismanagement of these containers may result in the type of seriousenvironmental degradation that closed beaches in past summers. The legislativehistory indicates that the MWTA was clearly intended to address this typeof degradation. Intravenous bags are being included in this category because they may continueto resemble blood bags even after certain treatment processes. Althoughintravenous bags may not have come into contact with any pathogenic microorganisms,the aesthetic degradation of the environment caused when they are mismanagedwarrants their inclusion in the demonstration tracking program. EPA isusing the authority under RCRA section 11002(a)(11) to list these items,and is including these items in this part of the regulation for convenience.Class 3 also includes items that are saturated and/or dripping with humanblood or that were saturated and/or dripping but have since dried. Thesewastes are aesthetically objectionable and, while they may present lowpotential for causing adverse health effects, in certain instances theypose a potential health threat if mishandled in the presence of other wastematerial such as sharps. This concern should only be present if the bloodis in liquid form. Items with large quantities of dried blood are not likelyto transmit disease. The blood is generally not present in a form (i.e.,liquid) likely to pose a significant hazard to the persons handling thewaste, but blood-caked items may still cause environmental (aesthetic)degradation, so these items are included in Class 3 as described above.d. <T3>Class 4_Used Sharps. </T3>EPA's regulatory description of Class 4,used sharps, is based on section 11002 (a)(4), and reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Sharps that have been used in <T3>animal or human </T3>patient care <T3>or treatment </T3>or in medical, research, or industrial laboratories,including hypodermic needles, syringes (<T3>with or without the attached needle</T3>), pasteur pipettes, scalpelblades, <T3>blood vials, test tubes, needles with attached tubing, and culturedishes (regardless of presence of infectious agents). Also included areother types of </T3>broken <T3>or unbroken </T3>glassware that were in contact with infectious agents,such as used slides and cover slips.</ITAG>Sharps, with the exception of certain glassware, as explained below, areuniversally recognized as requiring stringent regulation under this program,given the unique bio and physical hazards as well as environmental degradationproblems associated with used sharps (unused sharps are addressed in aseparate class). The statutory waste type description has been modifiedslightly to clarify that sharps generated in care of both humans and animalsare covered. It also includes the word ``treatment'' to cover sharps generatedfrom the preparation of human and animal remains for burial or cremation.Syringes are included under this class regardless of whether a needle isattached because EPA believes that this interpretation is consistent withthe intent of Congress under the Medical Waste Tracking Act to minimizefurther improper disposal of aesthetically offensive medical wastes inthe natural environment. Blood vials and culture dishes, which may alsomeet the descriptions of Waste Classes 3 and 1, respectively, were includedin this class because the packaging requirements for sharps are more protectiveof waste handlers. Needles with attached tubing are included because ofthe physical and biohazard that may be present with the needle. EPA has included in Class 4 certain wastes from RCRA section 11002(a)(7).These wastes are slides and cover slips that were in contact with infectiousagents. In general, laboratory glassware that was not in contact with infectiousagents does not pose the same kinds of aesthetic concerns as other sharpsand is already adequately managed as general refuse. Therefore, only slidesand cover slips that were in contact with infectious agents are listedin Class 4. Finally, because the physical and aesthetic concerns are independent ofthe nature of medical service provided, EPA interprets Class 4 to coversharps used in veterinary services as well as human patient care. e. <T3>Class 5_Animal waste. </T3>EPA's description of Class 5 is based onsection 11002(a)(5), and reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Contaminated animal carcasses, body parts, and bedding of animalsthat were <T3>known to have been </T3>exposed to infectious agents during research(<T3>including research in veterinary hospitals</T3>), production of biologicals,or testing of pharmaceuticals.</ITAG>Two modifications were made to the statutory language to clarify the wastesincluded in this class. First, the phrase ``known to have been'' was addedto emphasize that only wastes from animals known to have been exposed toinfectious agents during research are regulated medical waste. Withoutthis phrase, it would be difficult for generators to identify accuratelythose wastes that should be regulated, which would make both compliancewith and enforcement of this regulation problematic. This definition doesnot include household pets, farm animals, or wastes from farm animals unlessthey were exposed to infectious agents during research, production of biologicals,or testing of pharmaceuticals. The second clarification includes veterinary hospitals as an example ofa research facility. This was suggested by attendees at EPA's medical wastemeetings, because such facilities may generate contaminated animal waste.Wastes generated by general veterinary practices (e.g., small animals)are not covered in Class 5. However, the reader should note that sharpsfrom veterinary services are covered under Class 4. As guidance in determining what organisms are ``infectious agents'', thereader may use those agents identified in Classes 2 through 4 of the CDC's<T3>Classification of Etiologic Agents on the Basis of Hazard </T3>(July,1974, available in the docket). Because EPA's definition of ``infectiousagent'' in andSection; 259.10 is limited to those organisms that cause diseaseor adverse health impacts in humans, only animal wastes potentially posinga hazard to <T3>human</T3> health are covered in Class 5. f. <T3>Class 6_Isolation wastes.</T3> EPA's regulatory description of thisclass is identical to section 11002(a)(10) in all but one respect, andreads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Biological waste and discarded materials contaminated with blood,excretion, exudates, or secretions from humans who are isolated to protectothers from <T3>highly </T3>communicable diseases, or isolated animals <T3>known to be infected with highly </T3>communicable diseases.</ITAG>Although the statute refers to ``communicable diseases'' generally, theAgency believes that only certain <T3>highly</T3> communicable diseases should be included in the demonstrationprogram. Health care professionals recommend that the scope of this classbe limited to only those specific diseases that are sufficiently communicableto pose a potential threat to public health (for example, diseases causedby those agents listed in Classification 4 by the CDC in <T3>Classification of Etiologic Agents on the Basis of Hazard </T3>(1974)).The Agency considered regulating all wastes from isolation patients, butconcluded that many of the waste items are already covered under otherwaste classes, and that regulating all wastes from isolation patients wouldneedlessly subject large amounts of waste to handling and packaging accordingto the requirements of the tracking program even though the large majorityof such waste would be neither infectious nor aesthetically objectionable.For example, health care facilities have the option of assessing whichisolation wastes, in addition to those required by these regulations, shouldbe managed as regulated medical waste. EPA requests comments on its approachand recommendations on any alternative approaches. g. <T3>Class 7_Unused sharps. </T3>Under the authority provided by section11002(a)(11) of the MWTA, EPA has elected to include the following unused,discarded sharps as a class of regulated medical waste: hypodermic needles,suture needles, syringes, and scalpel blades. The improper disposal ofsharps has, in some areas, presented sufficient potential health hazardand environmental degradation for local officials to restrict public accessto beaches. When inappropriate appearances of sharps occurs, as in theexample of beach wash-ups, it is neither practical nor necessary to tryto distinguish used from unused sharps for several reasons. First, bothused and unused sharps present the same physical hazard in terms of thepotential for puncture injuries. Second, time usually does not allow forthe testing of improperly disposed sharps to determine the presence ofinfectious agents. Additionally, unused sharps present the same possibilityof aesthetic degradation of the environment as do used sharps. Given thelegislative history indicating serious Congressional concern over environmentaldegradation caused by sharps, the Agency believes the combination of physicalhazards and aesthetic concerns are sufficient reasons to list certain unusedsharps as regulated medical waste. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Determination To Exclude Certain Waste Types </ITAG>EPA has made a determination that certain wastes listed in section 11002(a)of RCRA do not pose a substantial present or potential hazard to humanhealth or the environment when improperly managed. EPA made this determinationafter numerous discussions with public health experts and a thorough reviewof the available information, including contact with Dr. William Rutala,a researcher who conducts an annual literature review to locate documentedcases of disease transmission. EPA has concluded that items in waste types(1)-(5) have some potential  to cause harm, and has structured today'srule so that the wastes in sections 11002(a) (6)-(9) which may pose a presentor potential threat to human health are regulated medical wastes subjectto Part 259 requirements. The remaining wastes (those not included withinthe waste classes listed in the regulation) do not pose substantial healthor environmental hazards. This determination is described in more detailin the <T3>Background Document for Part 259 Subpart D, Listing of Medical Waste,</T3>available in the docket for this rulemaking. Under section 11002(b) of RCRA, the Administrator is authorized to exemptfrom the requirements of the demonstration program any of the wastes, bytype or by item, listed in sections 11002(a) (6)-(10) of the statute ifhe determines that such wastes do not pose a substantial present or potentialthreat to human health or the environment when improperly treated, stored,transported, disposed of, or otherwise managed. The sections 11002(a) (6)-(9)waste descriptions are based on a waste's source and contain a varietyof items. Many of the individual items in sections 11002(a) (6)-(9) are,under certain conditions, already included in the sections 11002 (a) (1)-(5)waste types. For example, surgery wastes such as scalpels and suture needlesare already included in section 11002(a)(4), and laboratory wastes suchas discarded tissue specimens are already included in section 11002(a)(2).EPA examined the remaining items in sections 11002(a) (6)-(9) that arenot identified in section 11002(a) (1)-(5), and has specifically listedin the regulation certain items that may pose a substantial health or environmentalhazard. As explained previously, used slides and cover slips (from laboratories)that were in contact with infectious agents are examples of items fromsections 11002(a) (6)-(9) that were included in the regulation. Thus, EPAhas determined it is not necessary to list sections 11002(a) (6)-(9) specificallyin today's rule. For the remaining wastes included in sections 11002(a) (6) through (9),in comparison to the wastes that Congress mandated to be subject to thetracking program due to their potentially harmful physical properties (e.g.,sharps) and/or biological properties (e.g., blood or cultures), the itemsto be excluded do not exhibit either property sufficiently to warrant inclusionin the demonstration program. (In evaluating the potential for wastes topresent an infection hazard, factors such as the presence of a pathogenat its infecting dose, the pathogen's portal of entry to the body, andthe host's resistance to infection must be considered.) EPA also conducteda thorough review of available information and consulted with representativesof the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health,other health care professionals, and State officials; based on these consultations,EPA did not find evidence that the handling of those remaining wastes includedin sections 11002(a) (6) through (9), not already addressed in EPA regulatedmedical waste Classes l through 7, present a substantial hazard to humanhealth or the environment when mismanaged. On this basis, the Agency believesthat wastes in sections 11002(a) (6) through (9) that are not already includedin the EPA Classes 1 through 7 should not be included in the demonstrationprogram. In certain instances, EPA recognizes that a health care professional maydetermine that some wastes in sections 11002(a) (6) through (9) shouldbe handled as infectious wastes based on the professional's experienceand knowledge of the waste in light of the specific conditions necessaryto transmit disease (presence of a pathogen of sufficient virulence; dose;portal of entry; and resistance of host). In these instances, consistentwith the Agency's 1986 guidance document, EPA encourages the health careprovider to manage such wastes as regulated medical waste. However, EPAbelieves that the decision on how to manage such wastes is appropriatelymade by the generator on a case-by-case basis according to its establishedinfection control procedures. In summary, as described above, EPA believes that the demonstration programand its tracking requirements are targeted to those wastes that have beenimproperly managed and on those likely to pose a substantial threat tohuman health and the environment. If, as a result of the demonstrationprogram and other studies required by the Act, the Agency determines thatadditional wastes are posing a substantial threat to human health or theenvironment, EPA may expand the list of regulated medical waste to ensurestrict management of problem wastes.  <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Unregulated Medical Wastes </ITAG>Certain wastes generated in a medical setting or research laboratoriesthat are not covered in the listing of regulated medical waste are notsubject to the Part 259 regulations, except for mixtures described below.EPA nonetheless recommends that any waste that an individual practitioneror health care professional believes may pose a risk of disease transmissionshould be handled as a regulated medical waste. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Mixtures </ITAG>EPA is requiring mixtures of regulated medical waste and other nonhazardoussolid waste, including non-regulated medical waste, to be regulated undertoday's requirements. This requirement is established to prevent partiesfrom avoiding regulation through mixing. Also, the physical and aestheticproperties that caused Congress' concern over many of these wastes arenot removed by mixing and such mixture would be inconsistent with the Congressionalmandate that medical wastes be segregated to the extent practicable. However, mixtures of regulated medical waste with hazardous waste thatis subject to the hazardous waste manifest requirements are subject toregulation as hazardous waste, not medical waste (See andSection; 259.31).EPA has determined that when regulated medical waste is mixed with hazardouswaste, and the resulting mixture is otherwise subject to the hazardouswaste manifesting requirements, it is unnecessary to require an additionaltracking form for the medical waste component of the mixture. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Exclusions and Exemptions </ITAG>Section 259.30(b) of today's rule identifies seven provisions under whichmedical wastes are not subject to the requirements of the demonstrationprogram. This section of the Preamble explains five of those provisions.The provisions for household and hazardous waste exclusions are discussedelsewhere in the Preamble. a. <T3>Incinerator ash and treatment/destruction residue.</T3> Regulated medicalwaste that has been both treated, so as to substantially reduce or eliminateits potential for causing disease, and destroyed, is no longer regulatedmedical waste, but generators who both treat and destroy regulated medicalwaste on-site are subject to certain recordkeeping requirements under thisPart while they conduct the treatment and destruction. In addition, section11003(a) specifically excludes waste which has been incinerated from thetracking program. In today's regulation, these two types of residues ceaseto be regulated medical waste at the point where the incineration has beencompleted, or at the point where both treatment and destruction processeshave been conducted. Processes such as incineration involve reducing or eliminating the biologicaland physical hazard of the wastes, as well as their visually offensivenature, to the extent that they are no longer likely to pose a substantialthreat to human health or the environment in the event of mismanagement.Residues from wastes that have been treated and destroyed (e.g., wastethat has been decontaminated and ground up) and incinerator ash are nolonger ``regulated medical waste'' and can be managed under other applicablerequirements for such residues. The Agency believes that it is sound policyto encourage treatment to reduce the biologic and physical hazard of regulatedmedical wastes as early in the waste management chain as possible, therebyminimizing the potential impacts resulting from mismanagement of the waste.Under andSection; 259.30(b)(1)(iv) the first criterion, treatment, is satisfiedif the waste is processed by a means designed to reduce levels of infectiousagents. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that the concentrationof microorganisms capable of causing disease in humans is reduced so asto render such waste noninfectious or less infectious and, thus, saferto handle, transport, and dispose of. However, waste need not be sterilized.The treatment processes commonly available are not 100% effective in inactivatingmicroorganisms. Complete inactivation is unnecessary, since any refuseis expected to support some level of bacterial activity. In the context of medical waste management, ``treatment'' is defined asany method, technique, or process designed to change the biological characteror composition of medical waste so as to eliminate or reduce its potentialfor causing disease. EPA's 1986 guidance document, <T3>EPA Guide for Infectious Waste Management </T3>(U.S. EPA, Office ofSolid Waste and Emergency Response, EPA/530-SW-86-014, May 1986), describesmany of the techniques available for adequately treating regulated medicalwaste. As the guidance document explains, incineration and steam sterilization(autoclaving) are the most common treatment methods for medical wastes.There are, however, several other less commonly used treatment methodsthat are acceptable for certain waste types, such as chemical disinfection,thermal inactivation, and irradiation. Not all of these processes willmeet the treat and destroy criteria, but some combinations (e.g., chemicaldisinfection followed by grinding) may indeed meet both criteria. EPA strongly encourages operators of treatment devices to become familiarwith these guidelines. Further, the Agency recognizes that methods andtechnologies other than those discussed in the guidance document may beavailable for treating medical waste and does not want to discourage emergingor innovative technologies. Regardless of the method chosen, the importantpoint is that the operator should understand the factors affecting theeffectiveness of the treatment method used and establish a program to ensurethat the treatment objectives are met. Specifically, EPA recommends: i. Using standard operating procedures for each process employed for treatingregulated medical waste; ii. Monitoring all treatment processes to ensure efficient and effectivetreatment;iii. Using biological indicators to monitor treatment (other indicatorsmay be used, provided that their effectiveness has been successfully demonstrated);and iv. Selecting treatment methods appropriate for the waste types being treated.The lack of an objective treatment standard for determining whether a wastehas been disinfected is problematic. Data are not currently available toestablish objective standards. A long-term goal of EPA's medical wasteprogram is to evaluate the effectiveness of various treatment alternativesand either to issue additional guidance or promulgate treatment standards.Additionally, generators and treatment facility owners and operators areadvised to consult with the waste management agency in their State to determineif additional requirements apply. States may require operating plans orspecify operating conditions or monitoring methods. The second criterion in andSection; 259.30(b)(1)(iv), destruction of thewaste, is satisfied when the waste is ruined, torn apart, or mutilatedso that it is no longer generally recognizable as medical waste. EPA hasdetermined that when waste has been both treated (substantially removingor reducing any biological hazard) and destroyed, all of the Agency's concerns(i.e., biological and physical hazards, and aesthetic degradation) havebeen addressed, and tracking of the waste is unnecessary. Processes capable of destroying medical wastes include incineration, grinding,shredding, crushing, or melting. EPA recognizes that a determination ofwhen a medical waste is ``destroyed'' is somewhat subjective, but believesthis standard is workable in practice for owners or operators of treatmentand destruction facilities, and for generators. Moreover, Congress acknowledgedthe validity of the ``rendered unrecognizable'' standard, in section 11008(a)(6),with respect to medical waste treatment and the protection of human healthand the environment. One currently used method that meets both conditions involves the combinationof chemical disinfection and grinding. Another process that could achievethe same results involves steam sterilization followed by shredding. EPAnotes that for grinding processes, ``destruction'' can generally be assessedby use of a mesh size determination for the ground particles. The processescurrently in use can generally achieve a \1/2\ inch mesh size (i.e., theresulting particles will pass through screening having one-half inch wideopenings). This standard is only being used as a guide, however, becauseno grinding process that EPA is aware of can achieve a \1/2\ inch particlesize for 100% of the material. It should be noted that the exclusion applies to wastes at the point inthe waste management chain when the waste has been both treated and destroyed.If wastes are treated and destroyed on-site by the generator, they typicallyenter the general refuse waste stream directly and are not subject to thesubstantive requirements of the demonstration tracking program. Regulatedmedical waste that is shipped off-site for treatment is subject to therequirements of the demonstration program up to the point it is treatedand destroyed. After it has been treated and destroyed, it is no longerregulated medical waste. Finally, EPA has included a requirement for persons claiming that theyhave caused regulated medical waste to meet the terms of the exclusionto maintain records of the amounts of waste treated and destroyed (andtherefore excluded from regulation). The records could be simply a logonto which entries are made on a regular basis (i.e., daily, per batch,etc.). Generators who use on-site incinerators must keep these recordsunder andSection; 259.61, discussed elsewhere in the Preamble, in which caseno additional recordkeeping is required. Generators using processes otherthan incineration are not subject to andSection; 259.61, but, nonetheless,must keep records to qualify for the exclusion under andSection; 259.54(c).EPA believes such a recordkeeping provision is necessary to ensure theexclusion is not abused by persons who do not track their waste and donot really meet the terms of the exclusion. EPA notes that when a broadremedial scheme is established, such as Subtitle J, the burden of proofshould fall on persons claiming any available exclusions or exemptionsfrom that scheme. b. <T3>Human remains. </T3>The regulation provides that human remains (e.g.,corpses and anatomical parts) that are stored, transported, or otherwisemanaged for purposes of interment or cremation, are not subject to anyrequirements of this part, because such human remains are not ``regulatedmedical waste''. Inclusion of this provision in the regulation is for purposesof clarification. c. <T3>Etiologic agents. </T3>The Agency recognizes that etiologic agentsare being transported interstate between facilities according to regulationsset by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the U.S. Department ofHealth and Human Services. The Agency believes that those existing regulationsensure safe packaging, handling, and transport of these materials and,thus, these materials should be exempt from today's rule. However, whenetiologic agents that are regulated medical waste are intended for discardand are not being transported according to DOT and HHS regulations, theyare subject to all of the requirements of today's rule. d. <T3>Enforcement samples. </T3>Samples of regulated medical waste obtainedduring enforcement procedures by authorized EPA personnel or States usingFederal authorities are exempt from the requirements of this Part. Thesesamples, typically small in volume, temporarily taken out of the wastemanagement system for evaluation, and subject to the oversight of governmentagencies involved in legal proceedings, are unlikely to be mismanaged.However, when such evaluations or legal proceedings are concluded, thesample will again be subject to all of the requirements of today's rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Relationship to Previous EPA Definition </ITAG>In addition to providing guidance on waste management practices, the <T3>EPA Guide for Infectious Waste Management </T3>provides a definitionof ``infectious waste.'' The recommended definition includes six wastetypes that should be managed according to the guidelines and four ``optional''types that could be managed as either infectious waste or general refuseat the discretion of the generator. Today's rule does not define infectious waste; rather, it defines thosemedical wastes that are subject to the requirements of the demonstrationprogram, regardless of infectiousness. Actual or potential infectiousnessof a waste is only one criterion the Agency used to determine which wastesmust be tracked under this program; physical hazard and potential aestheticdegradation of the environment are also major considerations. Generators may continue to follow EPA guidelines for waste management withintheir facilities; however, when regulated medical wastes are generatedin Covered States, such wastes are subject to the requirements of the demonstrationtracking program described in these provisions. Any suggestions in the<T3>EPA Guide for Infectious Waste Management </T3>that are not completelyconsistent with the Part 259 requirements would be superseded by today'sregulations. Generators in non-Covered States should continue to rely onthe <T3>EPA Guide, </T3>and must comply with applicable State and local rules.In summary, regulated medical waste that has been treated and destroyedis exempt from all but certain recordkeeping requirements under today'srule. The reader should note that waste that is treated, but not destroyed,must be tracked but is subject to certain reduced requirements. (This isdiscussed later in the Preamble.) Also, generators are required to classifytheir wastes as ``untreated'' or ``treated'' on the tracking form, andtransporters must report quantities of such wastes transported. As explainedlater in the Preamble, EPA will be collecting information to determinechanges in treatment practices over the life of the demonstration program.The Agency welcomes comments on the general definition of regulated medicalwastes, on the appropriateness and content of the list of regulated medicalwastes, and on the exclusions and exemptions provided. EPA also requestscomments or suggestions for a more objective method of determining whatconstitutes ``treated and destroyed.'' E. Subpart E Pre-transport Requirements The Act requires EPA to include specific requirements for segregation,packaging, and labeling of medical waste regulated in the demonstrationprogram. As a result, today's rule includes pre-transport requirementsfor medical waste, including requirements for segregating regulated medicalwastes from other types of solid waste (e.g., general refuse, hazardouswastes), separating medical wastes by category (untreated and treated),packaging the medical wastes, and labeling and marking the packaged materials.The requirements of Subpart E generally apply to those regulated medicalwastes generated in a Covered State that are transported, or offered fortransport, off-site. Wastes that are treated and/or disposed of on-siteat a generator's facility are subject only to the general storage requirementsof andSection; 259.42. Most of these requirements are applicable to, andmust be complied with by, the generator. Several of the requirements mayalso apply to transporters and treatment facilities (e.g., storage). Generators must ensure that all medical waste subject to these regulationsmeets all pre-transport requirements prior to shipment or being offeredfor shipment off-site, either from the generator's facility or from anyintermediate site of treatment and/or storage. Wastes treated on-site priorto being transported off-site for disposal must meet all pre-transportrequirements before being shipped off-site. However, as discussed above,medical wastes that are incinerated or otherwise ``treated and destroyed''on-site are exempt from these regulations under andSection; 259.30(b)(2).Regulated medical wastes retained on-site prior to incineration or othertreatment or disposal processes must be stored in a manner that will preventunauthorized access to the waste and will keep the waste free of animalsand pests. The regulated medical wastes to be incinerated on-site are notsubject to any other pre-transport requirements. Incinerator ash is exemptfrom Part 259 requirements, but must be managed in accordance with applicableFederal, State, or local requirements. Regulated medical wastes that willbe incinerated off-site must meet all pre-transport requirements priorto transport. EPA's intent, in establishing segregation, packaging, labeling, and markingrequirements for regulated medical wastes, is to ensure proper containmentof the waste and to protect workers, handlers, and the general public fromexposure to these materials. EPA intends for all packages containing regulatedmedical wastes to be labeled and marked and, therefore, easily identifiedas medical waste. Generator compliance with these rules will alert workersand waste handlers to take necessary precautions when handling or transportingthe waste to protect themselves and the environment. As discussed below,the generator's signature on the tracking form is the generator's certificationthat the waste is packaged, labeled, and marked properly. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Segregation Requirements (Section 259.40) </ITAG>a. <T3>General. </T3>This section requires generators of medical waste tosegregate all categories of medical waste, to the extent practicable, priorto transport off-site. EPA believes it is generally necessary to segregatesharps, including sharps containing residual fluids, and fluids in quantitiesgreater than 20 cubic centimeters (cc) from all other medical waste, aswell as to segregate these wastes from each other. EPA believes that sharpsand fluids pose special problems in waste handling and are best managedif placed in special containers. If not segregated, these items can contaminateother medical waste. Segregating sharps and fluids should increase theintegrity and safety of all medical waste packaging and protect those personshandling the waste. Used needles, syringes, and other sharps, includingthe residual fluids contained therein, must meet more stringent packagingrequirements than all other waste. In addition, fluids in quantities greaterthan 20 cubic centimeters (cc) must meet certain packaging requirements.Other regulated medical waste must be segregated, to the extent practicable,from other waste (e.g., hazardous, radioactive, or general refuse), aswell as from sharps and fluids. b. <T3>Mixing of regulated medical waste. </T3>When regulated medical wastecannot be segregated from other waste (i.e., it is not practicable), thegenerator must ensure that the waste is packaged and marked according tothe applicable packaging requirements. For example, if general refuse isplaced in the same container as fluids, then the packaging must meet therequirements for fluids. Further, if ``untreated'' regulated medical wasteis mixed and co-packaged with ``treated'' regulated medical waste the packagemust be labeled and identified on the tracking form as ``untreated medicalwaste.'' The scheme outlined above provides incentives for segregationwhen it is advantageous for the generator to do so, but still does notpreclude co-packaging when the generator determines it to be necessaryor appropriate. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Packaging Requirements (Section 259.41) </ITAG>Section 11003 of the MWTA requires that the demonstration program includerequirements for packaging medical waste that will protect waste handlersand the public from exposure to the dangers posed by medical waste. Undertoday's rule, generators must make certain that all medical waste is packagedprior to being transported or offered for transport off-site to ensurethe containment of the waste, the protection of workers and waste handlersfrom exposure to the waste, and the protection of human health and theenvironment. Today's rule requires that all regulated medical waste to be managed off-sitemust be packaged in rigid, leak-resistant packaging. Any number of containersmay be used to satisfy the basic performance requirements; for instancethe combination of a plastic bag and a rigid cardboard box generally couldsatisfy the performance standards of ``leak-resistance'' and ``rigid.''Although the plastic bags and other containers commonly used for wastecollection within the facility are generally able to withstand the stressesof handling and transport within the facility, the Agency believes thatadditional, rigid containerization is required to ensure integrity of thepackaging during transit off-site. The generator must ensure that the andSection;259.41 packaging requirements are met prior to the waste's being transportedoff-site. In a hospital setting, this means that wastes could be placedin containers (such as bins) meeting the requirements in a central location,such as a loading area.The Agency believes that these packaging requirements are an effectiveway to containerize waste that has been accumulated according to the commonestablished collection and handling practices utilized in the health caresetting. Comments submitted by an association representing waste handlersin response to the June 2, 1988 <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice (53 FR 20140) support the requirementfor rigid packaging for waste that is transported off-site. The Agency recognizes that, if the generator decides to double packagethe waste to meet the requirements, increased handling and disposal costsmay result. To increase the options available to the generator and transporter,today's regulations provide for the utilization of reusable containers,such as bins and drums, provided a liner is used or the container is decontaminatedprior to reuse. The Agency has not established special packaging standards for bulk materials(e.g., animal bedding) that are classified as regulated medical waste,since it is uncertain that a need exists for transport of such regulatedmedical wastes in bulk. The Agency requests comment on whether generatorsof regulated medical waste foresee the need to provide for bulk transportand any special packaging requirements that might be considered. Today's rule also specifies special packaging requirements for sharps andfluids. EPA's basic objectives in establishing these packaging requirementsare: (a) To ensure that all wastes are properly contained, without leakageor release into the environment; and (b) to provide flexibility in howparties may meet the standards. The Agency has been requested to establish specific performance standardsby some interested parties for specific types of containers (i.e., plasticbags, sharps containers, and boxes) when used for containment of regulatedmedical waste during transport. However, the Agency believes that it isinappropriate to specify specific performance standards for such containers,since packaging materials vary extensively in their physical and mechanicalproperties. For instance, it is quite possible that a 1-mil-thick filmof one polymer material will be more puncture, impact, and abrasion resistantthan a 2-mil-thick film of a different polymeric material. The physicalproperties can be affected further by the manufacturing process, such asextrusion and injection molding. The most appropriate manner of determiningthe suitability of a particular container with respect to its ability toresist puncture, leaking, and/or breaking under individual usage conditionsis to subject the container to those conditions. Therefore, in today'srule, the Agency has set general performance standards for packaging ofregulated medical waste. EPA requests comment on the appropriateness ofthese standards. The standards, discussed next, include general requirementsfor all regulated medical waste, and additional requirements for sharpsand fluids. a. <T3>General packaging requirements. </T3>In all cases, regulated medicalwaste intended for transport offsite must be placed in a single containeror a combination of containers that is rigid and leak resistant. For example,a box, pail, drum, or other container that can be closed or secured toprevent leakage during shipment could satisfy the ``rigid'' performancestandard, and in some cases could satisfy the ``leak-resistance'' requirementas well. In other cases, a plastic bag used as an inner liner may be necessaryto satisfy the ``leak-resistance'' requirement, or even more protectivepackaging may be necessary. The rule does not specify the containers' compositionor size, thus providing as much flexibility in packaging as possible. Ifuntreated regulated medical waste is packaged in plastic bag(s), the bag(s)must be red in color or display the universal biohazard symbol. The bag(s)must be sufficiently sturdy to prevent tearing or breaking and must besealed securely to prevent leakage. When treated regulated medical waste,other than sharps and fluids, is packaged in plastic bag(s), it must bepackaged similarly to untreated regulated medical waste, except the bag(s)does not need to be labeled. Labeling requirements are discussed in sectionV.E.5. Reusable containers may be used, as well as containers that canbe loaded on pallets and moved by forklift or mechanical means, as longas the handling procedures do not subject the containers to undue mechanicalstress or compaction. b. <T3>Sharps and fluids packaging requirements. </T3>EPA is requiring thatall sharps, including those that contain residual fluids, be placed inpackaging that is rigid, leak-resistant, and puncture-resistant. If thecontainer(s) cannot be sealed to prevent leakage, it must be placed ina plastic bag or other leak-resistant container that can be sealed to preventleakage. The intent is to ensure that sharps and associated residual fluids(often blood) are securely contained and the integrity of the packagingis maintained from the time the waste leaves the generator's site untilthe time the waste is disposed of or is treated and destroyed. The rule specifies that fluids in quantities greater than 20 cubic centimetersshipped off-site for treatment and/or disposal be packaged in packagingthat is rigid, leak-resistant, and break-resistant to guard against spillage.All vessels or containers must be tightly sealed or stoppered to preventleakage or spillage during transport. Fluids should not be placed in glasscontainers, since these containers may break during transport or handling.Blood bags and other non-rigid containers of fluids that contain more than20 cc of fluid are required to be packaged as fluids (see andSection; 259.41(b)(2)),since these items contain quantities of fluid which could be released duringwaste handling, contaminating other waste and posing a hazard for wastehandlers. Syringes and other containers such as vials and blood bags that containfluids in quantities of greater than 20 cubic centimeters (cc) may be emptiedprior to packaging. EPA has established a fluid residual level of up to20 cc's that may remain in syringes, tubing, vessels, and containers andstill allow the waste to be packaged under the requirements of andSection;259.41 (a) and (b)(1) only. This 20 cc level has been established basedon the State of New Jersey's regulations, as a conservative estimate ofthe residual volume of fluid that will remain in a container after it hasbeen emptied. The Agency is concerned that attempts to remove all remainingfluids may expose health care workers to additional risk, and such smallvolumes of fluid should not present any significant potential for contaminatingother wastes or waste handlers. c. <T3>Packaging requirements for oversized medical waste. </T3>EPA has notestablished specific packaging requirements for ``oversized'' medical wasteas defined in andSection; 259.10. Wastes falling into this category includeregulated medical waste too large to be adequately packaged in accordancewith the above standards (i.e., the waste will not fit in standard-sizedplastic bags or containers). These wastes should be managed to protectthe waste handler and public from exposure. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Storage Requirements (Section 259.42) </ITAG>Although an optimal medical waste management plan might involve the same-daycollection and treatment of regulated medical waste, many generating facilitiesare unable to accommodate this management scheme. This is particularlytrue for parties generating relatively small quantities of regulated medicalwaste. Thus, regulated medical waste intended for disposal off-site mayrequire storage prior to transport off-site. The Agency, in referring to on-site storage prior to transport, is referringspecifically to that area of the facility where waste is stored or accumulatedprior to off-site transport or disposal (or incineration or treatment/destructionon-site). Typically, it is the area within a generator's facility wherewaste is put into secondary containers, packages are marked and labeled,and where the medical waste tracking form is completed. As explained previously,the Agency is not regulating intermediate accumulation areas, such as thearea of the facility where waste is first generated (e.g., patient rooms,operating rooms, laboratories and waste holding areas (areas of the facilitywhere waste is accumulated and temporarily held)) until it is moved tothe facility's final on-site storage and packaging area.The storage requirements in today's rule are also applicable to regulatedmedical waste during transport and prior to treatment and disposal. Theserequirements will reduce the potential number of occurrences where thepublic could be exposed to the waste. EPA has established limited requirements to provide a minimum standardof safety and to ensure containment of the medical waste under the generalauthorities of section 11003(a)(4)(A) and (B), which require segregationand proper containment of waste to protect the public from exposure. EPArecognizes that individual States or localities may determine that additionalrequirements, or more specific requirements, are necessary. EPA is consideringdeveloping guidance (e.g., as part of a Model State Program) to aid Statesin the development of storage standards. Under today's rule, regulatedmedical waste must be stored in accordance with the following requirements:(a) Regulated medical waste must be stored in a manner and location thatmaintains the integrity of the packaging and affords protection from water,rain, and wind; (b) regulated medical waste must be maintained in a nonputrescentstate to avoid becoming a nuisance to workers and the public. Refrigerationmay be necessary depending on the type of waste stored and the length ofthe storage period; (c) regulated medical waste can be stored in outsidestorage areas (e.g., dumpsters, sheds, tractor trailers) only if the areasare locked to prevent unauthorized access; (d) regulated medical wastestored on-site must be contained in a secure, locked area, with accesslimited to authorized waste handlers and employees in order to preventexposure to the public; and (e) regulated medical waste must be storedin a manner that affords protection from animals and does not provide abreeding place or a food source for insects and rodents. EPA believes these are good housekeeping practices which are necessaryto maintain proper sanitary conditions and which will protect the publicfrom exposure. Comments are requested on these requirements and on theneed for additional requirements. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Decontamination Standards for Reusable Containers (Section 259.43)</ITAG>EPA is promulgating in today's rule general requirements for the decontaminationof packaging/shipping containers to allow for their reuse without compromisingthe safety of waste handlers. Any rigid container which is reused mustbe decontaminated prior to reuse if the container is visibly contaminated.If, for any reason, a container cannot be decontaminated and rendered freeof visible contamination, the container will be considered regulated medicalwaste and must be handled, treated, and disposed of as such. Inner linersused in conjunction with reusable containers must be disposed of with theregulated medical waste they contain. EPA's goal is to ensure protectionof all waste handlers. Therefore, any non-rigid package liners must remainintact and be disposed of with the waste, and may not be reused. Section 259.43(b) requires containers to be free of any visible signs ofcontamination prior to reuse. Under andSection; 259.43(c), any containerthat cannot be rendered free of visible contamination must be managed asregulated medical waste. The Agency is not requiring waste handlers toutilize any specific method to decontaminate containers in these regulationsbecause there was insufficient time to conduct technical studies to determinethe effectiveness of various methods. EPA suggests that reusable containersbe thoroughly washed and decontaminated each time they are emptied, unlessthe surfaces of the containers have been completely protected from contaminationby disposable inner liners, bags or other packaging devices removed withthe waste. Review of State standards indicates that suggested methods ofdecontamination include, but are not limited to, agitation to remove visiblecontaminants combined with one of the following procedures: (a) Exposureto hot water of at least 82 anddegrees;C (180 anddegrees;F) for a minimum of15 seconds; or (b) exposure to chemical disinfection in accordance withthe EPA-approved label directions for hypochlorite, iodoform, or quaternaryammonium antimicrobial products. The Agency requests comment on the appropriatenessof these suggested decontamination methods and other methods which maybe in use. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Labeling Requirements (Section 259.44) </ITAG>Section l1003 of the MWTA requires EPA to establish appropriate requirementsfor the labeling of regulated medical waste containers or packages. Thepurpose is to ensure that regulated medical waste can be easily identifiedas such during shipment and disposal. Under today's rule, EPA is requiringthat each package containing untreated regulated medical waste be imprintedor affixed with a label including the words ``Infectious Waste,'' ``MedicalWaste,'' or a label displaying the universal biohazard symbol. When a redbag is used as a container, however, the color red is recognized as anindicator that the bag contains untreated regulated medical waste and servesthe same function as the label. However, a label is always required onthe outer surface of an untreated regulated medical waste package, regardlessof the color of the package. Regulated medical waste categorized as ``treated medical waste'', discussedabove, does not require a label on the package. Such waste poses a substantiallyreduced risk of disease transmission, and a label indicating ``infectiousness''would not be appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Marking (Identification) Requirements (Section 259.45) </ITAG>Today's rule requires generators to ensure that all packages of regulatedmedical waste, including treated medical wastes and oversized medical wastes,that are shipped off-site be marked clearly to identify both the generatorand transporter of the medical waste. The purpose of this requirement isto facilitate identification of the generator and transporter of any regulatedmedical waste that is found to be mismanaged or disposed of improperly.All containers must be marked with the identity of the generator. The marking(s)placed on the outer surface of the package, once it has been prepared forshipment, must also include the identity of the transporter, the date thatthe waste is removed from the generator's site, and identification of thepackage's contents as medical waste. In conjunction with the date, othermarkings may be used to indicate or establish the unique shipment (e.g.,the tracking form number, a bar-code label, or some other assigned boxnumber). All such tags or markings must be water resistant to ensure survivalof the information in the event the package(s) or container(s) becomeswet. The marking, affixed to or placed on the package must specify the nameof the generator and the generator's State permit or identification number.If the State does not issue permit or identification numbers, then thegenerator's address must be used. Because EPA will not be issuing any generatoridentification numbers under this demonstration program, the generator'spermit or identification number will be any such identification numberthat is required by the State. Generators can use pre-printed markingsor have the marking printed directly on the package. The identificationtags must be of sufficient dimensions to contain all of the informationrequired and should be printed with lettering sufficiently large to beread easily. Markings placed on the outermost surface of the package must contain, inaddition to the generator identification information, similar informationfor all transporters (i.e., transporter's name, address, and/or State permitor identification number). Generators should obtain this information fromtransporters; transporters may provide generators with pre-printed tags,or may mark the packages for the generator prior to acceptance. The markingalso must include the date the package was shipped in order to facilitatetracking of individual shipments. When regulated medical waste is handled by more than one transporter, eachsubsequent transporter must affix an additional, separate identificationtag to the outermost surface of the package with the transporter's name,address and/or State permit or identification number, and the date of transfer(see andSection; 259.70(e)). All such tags should be placed on the secondarypackage so as not to obscure previously placed tags or markings. F. Subpart F_Generator Requirements The generator's role in tracking medical waste is vital since he is responsiblefor packaging, labeling, and marking the waste and for initiating the trackingprocess. The following paragraphs describe major sections of the generatorregulations in Subpart F of Part 259. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Applicability and General Requirements (Section 259.50) </ITAG>a. <T3>General. </T3>The rule requires all health care providers or otheraffected facilities located in the Covered States to determine whetherthe wastes they generate are regulated medical wastes. The Agency willwork with the States, trade associations, and other Federal agencies toinform generators in the Covered States of their new responsibilities undertoday's rule. Generators who generate mixtures of regulated medical wasteand hazardous waste may be subject to today's rule for those mixtures ifthe waste is not subject to the manifesting requirements of Subtitle C.Mixtures of regulated medical waste and radioactive wastes are subjectto today's rule (see Section VII.A of the Preamble). Under today's rule, vessels (including foreign-flagged ships) must manageany regulated medical waste according to these regulations when at portin a Covered State, and when such waste is to be removed from the vesselfor transport and disposal. In situations where a ship is docked at a shorebase, the shore base may perform the generator functions, such as maintainingrecords and initiating the tracking form, if waste is to be sent off-site,provided that the waste is stored at all times in compliance with the on-sitestorage provisions in andSection; 259.42. In this situation, the ship operatorand shore base operator are ``co-generators'' of the waste, and eithermay assume generator responsibilities. However, both parties remain liablefor compliance. Wastes managed at the generator's site through incineration, disposal tothe sewer, or burial, are not subject to the segregation, packaging, labeling,marking, or tracking requirements. These wastes are subject, however, tostorage requirements (andSection; 259.42) prior to on-site disposal. Additionally,all medical wastes incinerated on-site are subject to a Congressionally-mandatedrecordkeeping and reporting requirement, discussed below. As discussedabove, persons who claim the ``treated and destroyed'' exemption must alsomaintain certain records. b. <T3>Generator exemptions according to quantity. </T3>Generators who willbe sending their medical waste off-site must estimate quantities that willbe shipped off-site to determine if they may be subject to reduced trackingrequirements, as discussed below. Section 11003(b) allows EPA to establish an exemption from the trackingrequirements for generators of small quantities of regulated medical wastebased on the quantity generated per calendar month. EPA has determinedthat some form of exemption from the full tracking requirements is appropriatefor generators of less than 50 pounds per calendar month, because the paperworkburden resulting from tracking each shipment individually would overwhelmgenerators, transporters, treaters and disposers, making the whole trackingsystem virtually impossible to administer and thus ineffective. This wouldbe especially problematic in a program of short duration that affects personsnot formerly subject to similar regulation where Congress clearly envisionedexpeditious implementation. Discussions with State officials and healthcare organizations indicate that under the definition of ``regulated medicalwaste'' in today's rule, the universe of generators in the less than 50pounds per month category would be extremely large (in excess of 100,000).EPA considered an outright exemption under which waste from this categoryof generators could be disposed of in the normal (e.g., general refuse)solid waste stream. (This would be similar to the ``small quantity'' hazardouswaste generator exemption under 40 CFR 261.5.) EPA rejected this optionbecause some problems have been caused by relatively small quantities ofmedical waste being improperly managed. For the reasons discussed above, under today's rule, generators of lessthan 50 pounds per month of regulated medical waste are responsible for:proper packaging, labeling, and marking of waste; use of transporters whohave notified EPA; and use of a log to record when waste is transportedoff-site (see andSection; 259.50(e)(2)). These generators are not requiredto complete a tracking form for each shipment, nor are they required tocomply with the associated exception reporting requirements. These twoexemptions should result in a significant reduction of the paperwork burdenfor medical waste managers. EPA believes this limited exemption achievesthe appropriate balance between the need to ensure that even very smallquantities of medical waste are properly managed and the need to developa program that can be quickly and easily implemented. Comments are requestedon the approach described above.There are two further considerations related to generators of less than50 pounds per month. First, wastes disposed on-site (e.g., land-filledor sewer-disposed) are not counted towards the 50 pound limit. Since thesewastes would not be subject to the tracking requirements of today's rule,it is not appropriate to change a generator's regulatory status based onthe amount of material not sent off-site. (EPA notes that a similar conceptis used in the hazardous waste rules at 40 CFR 261.5.) Also, the readershould note that a generator need not count the weight of the packagingmaterials against the 50 pound per month limit. Second, the tracking requirements of today's rule apply in full to a generatorof less than 50 pounds per month, if he accumulates his waste on-site andships a package or packages with a total weight of 50 pounds or more atany one time or in any calendar month. The small generator exemption isthus limited to persons who generate less than 50 pounds per month andship less than 50 pounds at any time. The purpose of the 50 pound shipmentrule is to overcome the difficulties in ensuring compliance with the generator'sdetermination that he generates less than 50 pounds per month. Thus, theshipment rule establishes a clear measure for generators and transportersas to when a tracking form must accompany individual shipments of waste.Under Subpart H of today's rule, transporters who pick up wastes from generatorsproducing less than 50 pounds per month will be responsible for initiatinga tracking form for those wastes. However, transporters are allowed toinitiate a single tracking form to cover all of the waste present on eachtruck that is generated by generators of less than 50 pounds per month.A separate tracking document for each generator is not required. Therefore,while the generator is relieved of some of the paperwork burden, his wastestill will be responsibly tracked and handled. This is somewhat differentfrom the approach under the hazardous waste regulations. In the hazardouswaste regulations, EPA does not regulate waste from generators of lessthan 100 kilograms (220 pounds) per month (except for acutely hazardouswaste; see 40 CFR 26l.5). Since the medical waste tracking regulationsessentially regulate all listed medical wastes, the Agency determined someflexibility was necessary for managing so many very small shipments, anddeveloped the approach described above. c. <T3>Shipments between generators' facilities. </T3>EPA has establishedspecial requirements for shipments of regulated medical waste when thewaste remains under the generator's direct control (i.e., within an institutionor company) (see andSection; 259.51(b)). An institution or company sometimesships waste from the original generation point (e.g., a location elsewherein the same city) to a central collection point where waste is consolidatedfor further shipment or treatment, including incineration. In the UniformHazardous Waste Manifest system, when shipments of hazardous waste move``off-site'' (i.e., must traverse along, as opposed to across a publicroad), a manifest is required. For regulated medical waste, EPA believesthat tracking of such internal waste movements and use of transportersthat have notified EPA is unnecessary, provided certain conditions aremet. As an alternative to the full tracking provisions in today's rule, EPAis allowing a generator to transport his own waste without a tracking formfrom the point of original generation to a central collection point withinthe same State (see andSection; 259.51(b)) provided he complies with thepackaging, labeling, and marking provisions of Subpart E and the additionalreporting requirements of andSection; 259.56 of Subpart F. Generators whoelect to use this exemption are required to keep operating logs at eachsite of original generation and central collection point, containing informationsimilar to that required of generators of less than 50 pounds per monthunder andSection; 259.50(e)(2). When transporting the shipment, the generator's representative (probablyan employee) signs the first log maintained at the point of original generation;upon delivery to the central collection point, the representative signsthe second log maintained at the central collection point. At that time,the waste is once again subject to all of the requirements of Part 259,including Subpart G if the waste is incinerated. EPA believes that sincethe waste is under the generator's direct control during this transit,and since the transport will typically be short distances, the waste willbe properly managed without the need for the tracking form. This approach is different from that required under the hazardous wasteregulations (i.e., each shipment of hazardous waste sent off-site (traversingpublic roads) must be manifested). Available information indicates thatmedical waste does not pose the same kinds or degree of hazard posed byhazardous waste, which is why EPA has not listed medical waste as hazardouswaste. Further, EPA anticipates that many medical waste generators, suchas research facilities, will want to transport small amounts of medicalwaste to central locations for further management. Under the Subtitle Cprogram, generators of less than 100 kilograms (220 pounds) per month mayship waste without a manifest. Under today's rules, all generators of regulatedmedical waste are regulated. Requiring initiation of tracking forms fromall of these generators could overwhelm the tracking system and make itdifficult to implement, especially given the relatively short durationof the demonstration program. d. <T3>Transport by generators of less than 50 pounds of regulated medicalwaste per month. </T3>EPA also has established special requirements forgenerators of less than 50 pounds per month. In certain circumstances (andSection;259.51(a)), these generators may be exempt from the requirement to usetransporters who have notified EPA, and from the requirement to use thetracking form. This exemption allows a generator to transport his own regulatedmedical waste in his personal vehicle to his place of business, a healthcare facility, or a treatment or disposal facility, without the need tocomply with the transporter notification requirements, provided the wasteis properly packaged, labeled, and marked. To qualify for this exemption,the generator must have a written agreement with the facility to acceptthe waste. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that medical professionals(e.g., physicians or veterinarians) providing medical services away fromtheir place of business are allowed to transport the waste back to either:(1) Their place of business for proper transport to a treatment or disposalfacility; or (2) directly to a health care, treatment, or disposal facility.EPA has established these conditions because the Agency believes that healthcare professionals are capable of safely transporting small amounts ofregulated medical waste when compliance with the full set of requirementswould be impractical. While EPA's hazardous waste regulations do not make special provisionsfor this kind of transport, under Section 261.5, EPA does not regulatethe transport of such small amounts of hazardous waste (except acutelyhazardous waste). Finally, the reader should note that small individual generators may findit economical to contract as part of a group for waste management services.For example, a number of practitioners in a building, each with their ownpractice, could contract with a hauling and disposal company as a group.In this case, medical waste could be picked up from each practice withinthe building in packaging that would not be adequate for off-site transport(i.e., in plastic bags only) but the transporter would then combine thewaste in packages that meet all requirements (e.g., boxes, bins, etc.)before actually removing the waste from the building. In this way, thesesmaller generators could take advantage of economies available when shippinglarger quantities. Generators may also make similar arrangements with theirbuilding maintenance companies. In either case, each generator of courseremains responsible for complying with the applicable generator requirements.Also, as described in detail below, today's rule would allow transportersto ``remanifest'' (i.e., combine many small shipments on one tracking form)shipments from small generators, leading to reduced paperwork. Also, thebuilding management company may act under a contractual agreement and performthe remanifesting or consolidation function on behalf of the transporter.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Requirement To Use Transporters Who Have Notified EPA (Section259.50(f)) </ITAG>Except as discussed below for mail shipments, and above for the specialprovisions in andSection; 259.51 (a) and (b), generators in a Covered Statemay offer waste only to a transporter who has notified EPA that he intendsto operate in that Covered State as a regulated medical waste transporter.The notification procedure for transporters is discussed in Section V.H.of the Preamble and in andSection; 259.72. The generator is responsible fordetermining whether a transporter that he plans to use has notified EPA.EPA will provide each State with a list of transporters who have notifiedEPA in their State. Questions concerning the status of a transporter inany Covered State also may be addressed to the Chief, Waste CharacterizationBranch, U.S. EPA (0S-332), 401 M St. SW., Washington, DC 20460. The Agencywill maintain a master list for each Covered State of all transportersthat have notified EPA and have been assigned a medical waste identificationnumber. As described below, when certain regulated medical waste is shipped bymail, as specified in andSection; 259.51(c), generators need not meet therequirement to use a transporter who has notified EPA if certain conditionsare met. In meetings with State representatives, EPA was informed thatservices are being offered whereby discarded sharps are being sent by mailto facilities for treatment and disposal. Today's rule allows this practiceto continue provided the generator sends the shipment by registered mailwith a return receipt requested and the shipping package conforms withall U.S. Postal Service requirements. The exemption contained in today'sregulations allows this method of transport for generators of less than50 pounds of regulated medical waste per month who ship sharps (waste Classes4 and 7); these generators are not required to complete tracking formsfor their shipments of less than 50 pounds. For this reason the exemptionis limited to those generators who meet the conditions of andSection; 259.50(e)(2)(i).The return mail receipt serves the dual purpose of substituting for thetransporter log and tracking form. The Agency notes that the Postal Serviceis currently reevaluating its rules for shipping biological materials throughthe mail. EPA will continue discussions with the Postal Service on whether,and under what conditions, such shipments will continue to be allowed.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Acquisition and Use of the Tracking Form (Section 259.52) </ITAG>The core of the demonstration program, as explained above, is the requirementto track medical wastes from the site of generation to the treatment ordisposal facility. Each generator of 50 pounds per calendar month or more,or any generator who initiates a shipment of 50 pounds or more, is responsiblefor initiating a tracking form according to the directions given in andSection;259.52 and Appendix I. (Requirements for generators of less than 50 poundsper month are discussed below.) Even if the waste is being sent to a non-CoveredState, the generator is required to initiate a tracking form so that hemay receive a signed copy, assuring him of the waste's receipt at the destinationfacility. There must be a sufficient number of copies (at least four (4))so that the generator, each transporter, and the disposal facility or treatmentand destruction facility will each have a copy for its records; furthermore,there must be an additional copy to be returned to the generator. Statesmay require additional copies if they so choose under State regulations.a. <T3>Acquisition of the medical waste tracking form.</T3> Today's rule providesfor a hierarchy of tracking form use similar to that in the UHWM system.As with the Subtitle C hazardous waste manifest, States may choose to printthe Federally-required Medical Waste Tracking Form. The State form mustbe identical to the one published today as Part 259, Appendix I. If theState in which regulated medical waste is to be disposed (consignment State)is a Covered State supplying and requiring the use of a State-printed medicalwaste tracking form, then the generator must use the tracking form of theState of disposal. (The same requirement also applies to those instanceswhere the transporter initiates a tracking form.) If the State in whichthe regulated medical waste is to be disposed is a Covered State that doesnot supply or require the use of its tracking form, or the State is non-Covered,then the generator must use the medical waste tracking form of the Stateof generation if it supplies the form. If neither the generator State northe consignment (disposal) State supplies the medical waste tracking form,then the generator may have the Federal form (attached in the AppendixI to Part 259) reproduced for its use. Finally, EPA has established provisions today that require a transporterwho will be hauling waste to a Covered State which prints the trackingform to obtain the form and supply it to the generator. (See the note afterandSection; 259.52(b)(3), and see andSection; 259.74(a)(2).) EPA does not requirethis of hazardous waste transporters, but given the large number of smallmedical waste generators (most of whom have had little or no experiencein obtaining manifests), and the need to implement the medical waste trackingprogram quickly, EPA believes it is necessary to place this responsibilityon the transporter. b. <T3>Use of the medical waste tracking form.</T3> When initiating the trackingform, the generator, or his authorized representative, must fill in therequired information and sign the certification on the tracking form. (Atransporter may help the generator fill in the information, but the generatoris still responsible for complying with Subparts E and F and ensuring thatthe information entered on the tracking form is correct.) The certificationstates that the shipment contents are properly classified, packaged, labeled,and marked in compliance with all applicable State and Federal regulations,and that the generator is aware that civil and criminal penalties existif he withholds or misrepresents information on the form. (See AppendixI for the instructions for completing the Medical Waste Tracking Form.)The Generator Certification box of the Medical Waste Tracking Form promulgatedtoday is similar to the UHWM generator certification except that it requiresthat the signatory be formally authorized to sign for the facility. Asunder any tracking program, it is particularly important that the personsigning the medical waste tracking form have the training and knowledgenecessary to determine that the waste is actually properly packaged, labeledand marked. As a result, the person signing the form should be properlydesignated by the person in charge of the generator's operation (e.g.,in a doctor's office, the doctor) in order to ensure that the trackingof medical waste, which is the cornerstone of the demonstration program,is properly carried out.Although a formal authorization would generally be provided for any trackingform where the signatory must sign on behalf of the facility, the formpromulgated today explicitly requires a written authorization. EPA believesthat this requirement is warranted for today's form for several reasons.First, the regulations promulgated today will apply to a large and diverseregulated community which previously has not been regulated by EPA. Asa result, it is necessary to describe with greater specificity the stepsgenerators will need to take in order to assure that their wastes are properlymanaged and tracked. A requirement that authorization be written will alsoexpedite awareness by facility officials of their responsibilities underthis new program. Because of the relatively short amount of time priorto the effective date of this program and the desire to have the programoperational by this summer, there can be no delay in informing and educatingpersons responsible for medical waste management to the program requirements.Moreover, the need for greater specificity is also heightened by the shortduration of the program because there will be little time to revise andcure any shortcomings in the requirements promulgated today, includingthe generator certification. For these reasons, EPA is promulgating a moredetailed generator certification statement in today's form than that requiredunder the UHWM.The generator must identify his medical waste as either ``treated'' or``untreated,'' and must specify the quantity of each (both number of packagesand total weight or volume) in Box l1(a) and (b) of the tracking form.EPA also has provided a space (Box 11(c)) for State regulated medical waste.This may be used when a State regulates medical wastes not covered underthe Federal program (<T3>e.g., </T3>wastes from RCRA Sections 11002 (a) 6 through 9 that EPAchose not to list). The quantity of State regulated wastes should not berecorded in Boxes 11(a) or 11(b) but should be recorded separately in Box11(c). Finally, the generator must obtain the signature of the initialtransporter and retain a copy of the signed tracking form for his records.If rail shipments are initiated from the site of generation, the generatoris responsible for sending at least one copy of the signed tracking formto each of the following: (1) the first non-rail transporter, if one isused; (2) the destination facility, if the waste is transported solelyby rail; and (3) the last rail transporter, if the wastes are to be exported.These requirements are consistent with the Subtitle C Uniforn HazardousWaste Manifest system for transport by rail. The Agency did not wish toimpose a system of document handling that may be disruptive to existingpractices. The rationale for establishing such a system was developed in45 FR 12739, February 26, 1980. Finally, if the generator's medical waste is subject to the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission (NRC) regulations as well as EPA tracking requirements, theinformation required by the NRC can be placed on the tracking form in theappropriate boxes (<T3>e.g., </T3>generator's name and address). Information required by NRCbut not required by EPA (<T3>e.g., </T3>radionuclide identity) may be placed in Box 14 (SpecialHandling Instructions and Additional Information). If the space in Box14 is not adequate, the generator may attach sheets presenting the NRC-requiredinformation. Box 14 also may be used for instructions for handling oversizedregulated medical waste. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Use of Logs by Generators of Less Than 50 Pounds Per Month (Section259.54(b)) </ITAG>Generators who generate less than 50 pounds of regulated medical wasteper calendar month and do not ship in that calendar month any package(s)greater than 50 pounds must maintain a log that contains information onevery shipment of medical waste, if tracking forms are not used. The log,which must be maintained on-site for three (3) years from the date of themost recent entry, must provide the following information and must be signedby the transporter when the waste is picked up: the transporter's nameand address; the quantity and category of waste transported; and the dateof shipment. If the waste is transported personally by the generator, the log shouldbe completed to reflect this by having that person (<T3>e.g., </T3>the generator) or his authorized employee, who transportsthe regulated medical waste, sign the log as the transporter. The Agencyis not requiring the health care facility or destination facility to signthe generator's log since that would require that the generator carry thelog with him each time he transported regulated medical waste to a healthcare facility or the destination facility. To ensure that such wastes aredelivered to the health care facility, a treatment or destruction facility,or the destination facility, and that a record of the transaction is availablefor inspection or compliance monitoring, the Agency is requiring that thehealth care or destination facility to which the generator transports thewaste maintain a log as required in andSection; 259.83(b). Some generators may not know the volume of waste they generate until theend of a month. Each generator, however, is responsible for determininghis monthly generation and complying with the appropriate requirements(see andSection; 259.50(e), introductory text). Generators who believe theymay exceed the 50 pounds per calendar month limit in a given month mayfind it prudent to use the tracking form as a precaution. Some transportersmay, in fact, require the tracking form from all generators.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Exports of Regulated Medical Waste (Section 259.53) </ITAG>Generators (including transporters who initiate tracking forms) exportingregulated medical waste to a foreign country for treatment and destructionor disposal are required to request written confirmation from the acceptingfacility that the waste was received. In addition to receiving the writtenconfirmation, the generator should also receive a copy of the trackingform from the last domestic (U.S.) transporter as required under andSection;259.74(e). In order to obtain the written confirmation, the Agency suggeststhat generators, and transporters who consolidate waste not accompaniedby a tracking form, who are shipping regulated medical waste to a foreigndestination facility could forward two copies of the tracking form directlyto the treatment and destruction or disposal facility. The destinationgenerator should request that the owner or operator of the facility, uponreceipt of the waste, sign and return a copy of the tracking form, andin fact may want to include such a clause in any contract with the receivingfacility. The Agency also is requiring transporters who deliver regulated medicalwaste to a foreign carrier, foreign transfer facility, or foreign destinationfacility, to send a copy of the tracking form to the generator with thesignature of the accepting transporter, transfer facility, or destinationfacility. If the accepting transporter or destination facility is not willingto sign the tracking form, the last domestic transporter should indicatethis in Box 14 of the tracking form (Special Handling Instructions andAdditional Information). Generators, including transporters who have consolidated or remanifestedwaste onto a new tracking form (see andSection; 259.76), must file exceptionreports within 45 days, as required under andSection; 259.55, if they havenot received written confirmation of receipt of the regulated medical wasteby the destination facility. This requirement also applies in the caseof foreign shipments. The requirement that the generator request written confirmation from thedestination facility, coupled with the requirement that the last domestictransporter send a signed copy of the tracking form to the generator upondelivery of the waste to a foreign transporter, transfer facility, or destinationfacility, provides reasonable assurance that the waste has reached thedestination facility. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Recordkeeping (Section 259.54) </ITAG>There are a number of recordkeeping requirements for all generators ofmedical waste, including generators of less than 50 pounds per month. Generatorswho are required to use the tracking form must keep a copy of each trackingform for three (3) years from the date of acceptance of the shipment bythe transporter. These generators also must keep signed copies of eachof the corresponding tracking forms signed by the destination facilityfor at least three (3) years from the date of acceptance of the shipmentby the transporter. As with all other recordkeeping requirements of today'srule, the Agency has determined that such records are necessary for compliancemonitoring and for providing any generator-specific data needed to assessthe effectiveness of the program and the need for national medical wasteregulations. Recordkeeping is of particular importance in this programbecause the size of the regulated universe makes reporting by generatorsinfeasible. The Agency believes that three years is the appropriate timeperiod for record maintenance under this program for the following reasons:it is the standard used in several of the Covered States and other RCRAprograms; and it allows appropriate enforcement actions for program violationsincurred during the demonstration program. All records should be kept on-site so that they are easily accessible forinspection. If, however, recordkeeping operations are normally conductedat another corporate or business location, the generator may keep recordsthere, if they will be readily accessible for inspection purposes. As described in the next section of this Preamble (see Part 259, SubpartG), generators who incinerate wastes on-site must report the volume andtype of waste incinerated. (Information about wastes accepted from off-sitesources should also be included in the reports, where applicable.) Finally,generators who claim the andSection; 259.30(c)(2)(iv) exemption for wastethat has been treated and destroyed must keep records of the amounts treatedin such a manner in order to qualify for the exemption. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Exception Reporting (Section 259.55) </ITAG>For the tracking system to accomplish its purpose, officials must be alertedwhenever the tracking ``circle'' is broken. If the generator who initiateda tracking form does not receive a signed copy of the form from the destinationfacility (and in the case of foreign shipments, from the last domestictransporter) within 35 days after the waste was accepted by the initialtransporter, the generator must contact both the transporter and the destinationfacility to determine what happened to the waste and the tracking form.If a signed tracking form has not been received within 45 days from theinitial date of transport, the generator must submit an exception reportto the Regional Administrator and to his State that includes: (a) A legiblecopy of the tracking form for which the generator did not receive a signedcopy; and (b) a letter signed by the generator, detailing his efforts tolocate the waste. A copy of the exception report must be kept in the generator's recordsfor three (3) years. <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Additional Reporting (Section 259.56) </ITAG>Through broad authorities granted in Section 11004 of the Act, EPA canrequire generators to furnish additional reports concerning medical wastegenerated at their facilities. For example, during an enforcement proceeding,the Agency may require additional information concerning the dispositionof certain quantities of waste, including medical wastes not sent off-site(e.g., wastes disposed of on-site in sewers or landfills). Section 259.56codifies the information gathering authority provided in section 11004with respect to generators of regulated medical waste. Generators are requiredto provide any information available upon request. EPA has codified similarprovisions for transporters (andSection; 259.79) and for owners and operatorsof destination facilities (andSection; 259.84). Also, EPA requests comment concerning the various sources of informationand strategies available to gather the requisite information to developthe Reports to Congress, required under Section 11008. In particular, EPArequests comments on means to ascertain quantities of regulated medicalwastes discharged to sewers or landfilled on-site. Currently, the regulationsdo not provide for recordkeeping of these practices. Additionally, it has been requested that EPA require a one-time reportfrom generators describing the quantities of medical waste in the section11002(a)(6-10) waste types that are not regulated under the Part 259 requirements.EPA has determined that methods other than a generator report (e.g., astatistical sampling of the various generator types) could be used to obtainthe same information, with significantly less burden on the generators.EPA requests comment on the necessity of such a generator report and onother means of obtaining similar information.G. Subpart G_On-Site Incinerator RequirementsSection 11003(c) of RCRA requires EPA to promulgate recordkeeping and reportingrequirements for medical waste generators in Covered States who incinerateregulated medical waste on-site and, thus, do not track such waste underthe requirements of the demonstration program. The statute further directsEPA to require these generators to prepare and submit a report summarizingthe volumes and types of medical waste incinerated on-site during the first6-month period following the effective date of these regulatory provisions.The on-site incinerator reporting requirements in today's regulation satisfythis statutory requirement. EPA has decided to use its broad authorityunder RCRA Section 11004(a) to require information on the incinerationprocess and the incinerators themselves, in addition to the minimum informationrequired by the Act. Also, EPA is requiring the submittal of two reports.The first report will cover the first six (6) months of the demonstrationprogram, while the second will cover the thirteenth through the eighteenthmonth of the program. EPA believes the minimum information required bythe statute will be more meaningful if it is supplemented by informationon the incinerator operations, and if it is obtained both at the beginningof the demonstration program and after generators and regulators have acquiredsome experience with the specific requirements of the demonstration program.All of the information being requested will be necessary to satisfy theinformation requirements of RCRA Section 11008, including the present orpotential threat to human health and the environment posed by medical wasteincineration, and changes in incineration practices attributable to thedemonstration program. EPA chose not to require a breakdown of incinerator waste feed by wasteclasses as listed in today's rule for two reasons. First, it is not feasible(and in some cases it is impossible) for generators to segregate theirwastes according to the seven waste classes. Furthermore, in some cases,the increased handling that would be necessary to segregate wastes couldresult in increased risks to health care workers and other handlers ofthe waste. Additionally, there is little benefit in knowing the compositionby waste classes of the incinerator's waste feed. To determine health andenvironmental effects from incineration, knowledge of the BTU content ofthe wastes and the plastic and metal content is more useful. Finally, EPA is requesting the information in terms of weight of medicalwaste. Although the Act says ``volume,'' EPA presumes Congress simply meantamount. Measurements of actual volume are not reliable in this instance.For example, compaction and other volume reduction processes could rendera facility's volume estimate meaningless for estimating quantities of wasteincinerated. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Recordkeeping (Section 259.61) </ITAG>Today's rule requires medical waste generators who incinerate medical wasteon site to compile an operating log containing information on the amountsof waste incinerated, the frequency of incineration, and the length ofthe incineration cycle. EPA also is requiring generators with on-site incinerators to provide informationon amounts of waste received from sources outside the facility, in orderto assure compliance with the andSection; 259.51(a) exemption and to determinehow much regulated medical waste is brought from sources such as privatephysicians or small group practices. This information will provide a morecomplete picture of the quantities of regulated medical waste being incinerated.EPA is requiring information on the number of days of operation duringeach reporting period, the load frequency, and load amount. Since the emissionsvary throughout an incineration cycle, information on the number of start-upsfrom a cold unit will be used to estimate the health and environmentaleffects of incineration. The required information must be kept in an operating log, and must berecorded for each load or operating cycle. The generator must retain theoperating log for three (3) years from the effective date of today's rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Reporting (Section 259.62) </ITAG>Today's rule requires generators of regulated medical waste who incineratesuch waste on-site to prepare and submit two reports. These reports mustsummarize the information contained in the operating record. The legislationstipulates the first reporting period: the first six (6) months of thedemonstration program. EPA added a second reporting period (months 13 to18) in order to determine whether there have been changes in the managementpractices associated with regulated medical waste (e.g., changes in thevolume of waste incinerated) as a result of today's rule. Reports mustbe submitted within 45 days of the last day of the reporting period. TheAgency believes that this provides sufficient time to compile and summarizethe information contained in the operating record and collect other necessaryinformation to be included in the report. EPA has developed a form for the reports, which is found in Appendix IIto Part 259. Generators must use the form if they incinerate regulatedmedical waste on-site. EPA will make copies of the necessary reportingforms available, and generators also may use photocopies. H. Subpart H_Transporter Requirements This section of the Preamble describes specific requirements of today'srule as they pertain to the off-site transport of regulated medical wastes.It delineates the responsibilities of transporters and transfer facilities,and the Agency's rationale for establishing these responsibilities.<ITAG tagnum="81">I. Transporter Notification (Section 259.72) </ITAG>The central purpose of Subtitle J is to track the movement of medical wastefrom places of generation to the destination facility. In order to ensurethat generators utilize transporters that are aware of and understand thenew requirements of today's regulation, EPA is requiring a notificationfrom transporters. This notification process will help EPA and State officialsmonitor implementation of the program and ensure that transporters completetheir responsibilities under today's demonstration program and deliverthe regulated medical waste to the destination facility. Accordingly, today'srule specifies that each transporter who handles regulated medical wastegenerated in a Covered State must notify EPA of its intention to performthis activity. Transporters and transfer facilities must submit a separate notificationfor each Covered State in which the transporter intends to accept regulatedmedical waste directly from a generator. If they do not accept regulatedmedical waste directly from a generator, but from another transporter,they also must submit a notification for each Covered State where the wasteoriginated. This notification may be by letter, or may be prepared usingthe form in Appendix IV of Part 259. The use of this form is not required,but is strongly recommended by EPA. Each notification must contain thefollowing information: transporter's name, address (including all facilitiesintended for handling regulated medical waste which the transporter willoperate within the Covered State), telephone number(s); State permit oridentification number(s), if applicable; and a statement, signed by a corporateofficer or the owner/operator, that he has read, understands, and willabide by today's regulations. An original and one copy of that notificationletter must be sent to the Chief of the Waste Characterization Branch,EPA Office of Solid Waste, (0S-332), 401 M Street, SW, Washington, DC 20460.EPA recommends that transporters submit these notifications via certifiedmail return receipt requested. The return receipt can then serve as evidencethat they have indeed submitted their notification. A copy must also be sent to each Covered State for which the transporteris notifying. EPA will provide the mailing address of the agency withineach State to whom the notification should be sent in a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice to be published after the 30 day Statepetition-in/opt-out period has passed. Transporters must provide separate notifications for each Covered Statein which they will accept regulated medical waste directly from a generator,and for each Covered State whose generators' regulated medical waste theyexpect to transport. For example, if Transporter A expects to pick up wastein Covered States X and Y, he must provide two notifications to EPA (onefor State X, one for Y), and he must also send separate notifications toCovered States X and Y. Also, if Transporter A plans to accept regulatedmedical waste generated in State Z, a Covered State, via an intermediateTransporter (e.g., transporter B), Transporter A must nonetheless notifyfor Covered State Z because he will be accepting Covered State Z's waste.(Notification for Covered State Z must be sent to EPA and to Covered StateZ.) This is required even if Transporter A never enters Covered State Z.(In this example, Transporter B would also have to notify for Covered StateZ.) EPA will maintain a master list of transporters who have notified EPA fortheir operations in Covered States. EPA will also provide a list to officialsin each of the Covered States, to supplement their own information on transportersof waste that was generated in their State. This list also will facilitateany outreach, monitoring and enforcement activities. States also may usethe information to develop transporter licensing and permitting programs,under State law, if they so choose. The Agency will, upon receipt of the transporter's submittal of notification,transmit an acknowledgment signed by the Chief of the Waste CharacterizationBranch to the transporter. This will confirm that the transporter has providedall required information in his notification and will include an EPA assignedMedical Waste Identification Number. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Vehicle Requirements (Section 259.73) </ITAG>a. <T3>Vehicle configuration and condition. </T3>Proper handling of regulatedmedical waste shipments will minimize the potential for accidental dischargeof transported wastes and, thus, minimize the opportunity for personalinjury and/or potential infection of waste handlers or others who couldcome in contact with it. Compaction and/or rough treatment of packagedregulated medical wastes may compromise the integrity of the packagingand, therefore, must be avoided. Based on these concerns and the statutoryrequirement that the regulations must provide for proper containerizationof medical waste to protect waste handlers and the public from exposureto the waste, the Agency has required that all regulated medical wastebe transported in a leak-resistant, fully enclosed, non-compactor, cargo-carryingbody that is maintained in good operational and sanitary condition. SectionV.E.4 of the Preamble discusses decontamination practices that have beendescribed in various guidance documents or state regulations for reusablecontainers. The Agency is also recommending that these practices be usedto decontaminate vehicles. EPA solicits comments on the adequacy of thesepractices in protecting consumer products from contamination by residualregulated medical wastes. In addition, today's regulation allows the cargocarrying body to be used to transport properly packaged regulated medicalwaste simultaneously with other consumer products. EPA requests commenton whether vehicles should be dedicated to the transport of regulated medicalwaste. The requirement that the vehicle not compact these wastes is based on evidencethat compaction frequently will break the containers holding medical waste,resulting in the generation of loose waste, needles or sharps protrudingfrom containers, or leaking blood and other fluids, all of which are potentialsources of exposure to waste handlers or the public. Compaction also candestroy labels or container markings, thus making it difficult to trackthe waste accurately or to know whether a regulated medical waste has beenproperly treated. For the same reasons, medical waste must not be subjectedto violent mechanical stress during loading and unloading.b. <T3>Protective clothing. </T3>Although the Agency is not requiring specificprotective clothing for persons transporting and handling regulated medicalwaste, EPA believes that in order to avoid potential contamination and/orinjury while handling regulated medical waste, persons involved in theloading or unloading of packaged regulated medical wastes onto or off thetransport vehicles should use appropriate protective apparel as requiredby the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). In the eventthese protective garments become contaminated and are discarded, they shouldbe disposed of properly (by inclusion in the waste load, for example).c. <T3>Vehicle identification and markings andSection; 259.73(b). </T3>The Agencybelieves that public awareness of the medical waste tracking system isessential and will help in monitoring compliance with the program. Publicreporting of apparent illegitimate handling and disposal activities mayhelp reduce the incidence of these occurrences. To facilitate identificationof medical waste hauling vehicles, both for monitoring and reporting purposes,all vehicles involved in the transport of regulated medical waste mustbe marked appropriately with the hauler's name and any registration, license,or permit number required by the State. The marking must appear on bothsides and the rear of the cargo carrying body of the vehicle. These markingsmust be at least three (3) inches in height, and should be in a color thatcontrasts with that of the vehicle. The lettering sizes specified aboveand in andSection; 259.73 are based in part on existing State regulationsin New York and New Jersey and should facilitate easy identification of such vehicles. Additionally, while carrying regulated medical waste, bothsides and the back of the cargo carrying body shall display the words ``MedicalWaste'' or ``Infectious Waste.'' This may be in the form of a removablesign or markings. The Agency does not recommend that the vehicle displaythe universal biohazard symbol. Presently this symbol is being utilizedinternationally to identify vehicles carrying etiologic agents and, assuch, provides a warning to emergency personnel in the event of an accident.The U.S. Department of Transportation is also considering adopting thissymbol domestically as a label and placard for etiologic agents. The Agencyrequests comment on the appropriateness of these requirements. d. <T3>Accident response preparedness. </T3>The Agency believes that properpreparation for accidental releases involving medical wastes can limitthe potential damage and/or contamination associated with such incidents.Although the Agency has insufficient information to establish specificstandards for dealing with accidental releases of regulated medical wasteduring transport, EPA believes the following guidance should be observedto protect workers and the public. Vehicles engaged in the transport ofmedical waste should be equipped with spill containment and cleanup materials,have properly documented procedures for responding to accidental releases,and carry protective clothing (including gloves and coveralls). Additionally,the Agency believes all vehicles involved in medical waste spills shouldbe decontaminated following any accidental release. The Agency requestsfurther comment on the need for specific requirements regarding accidentalreleases, necessary spill containment equipment for vehicles, protectiveclothing for transport personnel, and vehicle decontamination standards.e. <T3>Storage restrictions and requirements. </T3>(Section 259.73(a)(5)):Regulated medical waste, as discussed in Section V.E. of the Preamble,is to be kept from reaching a putrescent state. In addition, pathologicalwastes, body fluids, anatomical parts, etc. must be maintained in a nonputrescentstate during transport and storage or must be refrigerated. Additionally,to prevent unauthorized access to these wastes, all vehicle cargo compartmentscontaining regulated medical waste must be secured (locked) if at anytimethe vehicle is unattended. For example, the vehicle should be secured ifunattended during a lunch break, during rest stops, or when the driveror other responsible persons will not be in visual sight of the vehicle.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Transporter Tracking Form Requirements (Section 259.74) </ITAG>As explained in the introduction to Section IV of the Preamble, the Agencyhas determined that a tracking system, designed along the lines of theUHWM system, will be an effective method for documenting the transportof regulated medical waste from its point of generation to its final destination.Exception and discrepancy reports will further aid in validating the systemand ensure that the proper management and disposal of regulated medicalwaste occurs. The tracking form documents the movement of waste from thesite of generation to the site of disposal, through each transaction phasein the process. The tracking procedure for transporters is specified inandSection; 259.74. [As explained previously, transporters who intend totransport regulated medical generated in a covered State to a destinationfacility in a different covered State that supplies and requires the useof its medical waste tracking form must provide the generator with thetracking form of the destination covered State.] Compliance with the trackingform amounts to a chain-of-custody procedure. The form must accompany theshipment and each person who signs the form is taking responsibility (``custody'')for the shipment while it is in his possession. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Acceptance of Medical Waste </ITAG>Before accepting any regulated medical waste for transport, the transportermust make certain through visual inspection that the waste is packaged,labeled, and marked in accordance with all applicable requirements (SubpartE of today's rule).<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Consolidation or Remanifesting of Regulated Medical Waste </ITAG>Today's rule also specifies conditions under which transporters must initiatetracking forms. This need arises when transporters receive shipments ofless than 50 pounds that are not accompanied by a tracking form. Giventhat today's rule requires that all shipments of regulated medical wastegenerated in a Covered State be accompanied by a tracking form when deliveredto a subsequent transporter, intermediate handling or to a destinationfacility, transporters will be required to document such shipments withtracking forms prior to transfer of custody. The Agency believes that transporterswill have accumulated more than 50 pounds of regulated medical waste fromnumerous generators of less than 50 pounds; therefore, the tracking formis required. The Agency is also allowing transporters and owners or operatorsof transfer facilities to consolidate and remanifest individual shipmentsof regulated medical waste that weigh less than 220 pounds onto a singletracking form. This provision will avoid the significant burden that wouldotherwise exist if transporters and treatment and disposal facilities wererequired to sign and account for individual tracking forms for each andevery shipment of regulated medical waste. Specific conditions and requirementsfor each follow. a. <T3>Generators of less than 50 pounds per month. </T3>Shipments from generatorsof less than 50 pounds per month may be documented in one of two ways.First, upon mutual agreement between the generator and transporter, theparties may simply use the tracking form as required for generators of50 pounds or more per month. As an alternative, however, the parties maytake advantage of the special provisions of andSection;andSection; 259.50(e)(2)and 259.74(g). Under the second approach, shipments of less than 50 pounds from generatorsof less than 50 pounds per month do not require a tracking form. Rather,the transporter is required to sign the generator's log and maintain hisown log recording each shipment of less than 50 pounds. The transporter'slog must contain the following information for each shipment: (1) Generator'sname; (2) generator's State permit or identification number or address;(3) quantity of waste by category (untreated, treated); and (4) date ofshipment. (It is not the obligation of the transporter to ensure that generatorswho log shipments of less than 50 pounds of regulated medical waste actuallygenerate less than 50 pounds of regulated medical waste per month; thisis the responsibility of the generator. However, any individual shipmentsof 50 pounds or more must be accompanied by a tracking form originatedby the generator.) Before delivery to the disposal facility, the transporter must initiatea tracking form, completing the generator section, to account for all consignmentsof less than 50 pounds of regulated medical waste in that load. Thus, ineffect, the transporter becomes a surrogate generator for these materials.The transporter also must attach to the tracking form a list containingthe names of all generators and the number of containers from each generatorthat have been consolidated onto the tracking form (e.g., this could bea copy of the transporter's log sheet). This will provide the transporterand the treatment or disposal facility with information necessary to handleany discrepancies that may occur. b. <T3>Shipments of less than 220 pounds. </T3>All shipments of 50 poundsor more of regulated medical waste or from a generator of 50 pounds ormore per month must be accompanied by a tracking form which has been filledout by the generator and signed by both generator and transporter. Thisform must be completed before the waste is transported off-site. Transportersmay consolidate and remanifest shipments of less than 220 pounds onto asingle tracking form for transport to a destination facility or at thetime those materials are transferred to a second transporter (see andSection;259.76 (b)-(d)). This ``remanifesting'' also may include shipments of lessthan 50 pounds that are accompanied by tracking forms. However, to facilitaterecordkeeping by transporters, EPA strongly recommends that shipments ofless than 220 pounds accompanied by a tracking form <T3>not </T3>be consolidated or remanifested onto the same tracking formas shipments of less than 50 pounds that were not accompanied by a trackingform. Instead, transporters should consolidate onto separate tracking forms:(1) Shipments accompanied by tracking forms; and (2) shipments of lessthan 50 pounds that are not accompanied by a tracking form. Keeping thetwo types of shipments separate will facilitate recordkeeping for returningthe tracking forms to the original generators who originated those trackingforms. Remanifesting is done to condense information from the tracking forms ofmany small shipments onto a new tracking form so that owners or operatorsof destination facilities need not sign an overwhelmingly large numberof individual tracking  forms. EPA believes the approach described herewill reduce a potentially overwhelming paperwork burden on destinationfacilities while still meeting the RCRA section 11003(a)(2) statutory objectiveof ``* * * providing the generator of the waste with assurance that thewaste is received by the destination facility.'' EPA has decided to allow remanifesting of only relatively small quantitiesof regulated medical waste because the remanifesting provision is somewhatless stringent than requiring each original tracking form to accompanythe shipment all the way to its destination. This approach has not beenimplemented by any of the individual States, and has not previously beenallowed for hazardous waste shipments. The remanifesting provision increasesthe possibility of clerical errors that could lead to discrepancies inthe quantities of regulated medical waste being shipped to their intendeddestinations. Thus, prior to allowing such a provision for all quantitiesof regulated medical waste, EPA believes that the Agency must monitor theeffectiveness of this more flexible procedure. Therefore, EPA is restrictingits use to shipments of less than 220 pounds during the duration of thedemonstration program. EPA will determine whether there is a significantincrease in the number of tracking system violations for remanifested regulatedmedical waste relative to that which requires that individual trackingforms accompany the waste. Comments are requested on the 220 pound limitin today's rule.At the time the transporter initiates the new tracking form, he also mustattach a copy of the transporter's log indicating the following for eachconsolidated load: (1) Generator's name; (2) generator's identificationnumber or address; (3) quantity of waste by category (untreated, treated);and (4) date of shipment or original tracking form number. Again, the purposeof carrying and providing such information to the destination facilityis to facilitate the resolution of any discrepancies that may occur. Here,as with consolidation of logged material from generators of less than 50pounds per month, the transporter becomes a surrogate generator of theredocumented waste, filling out the tracking form accordingly. In theseinstances, the new tracking form number must be indicated on the original(the generator's) tracking form(s), as specified in the instructions forcompleting the tracking form (see Appendix I to Part 259). The transportermust not return a copy of the original tracking form (the tracking formfrom the original generator) to the generator until he receives a signed,completed copy of the new transporter-initiated tracking form from thedisposal facility. A copy of that tracking form, signed by the destinationfacility, must be attached to the original form, and copies of both formsreturned to the generator. The transporter also must enter on the generator'soriginal tracking form the name of the destination facility if it is differentfrom the one already listed on the form. c. <T3>Shipments of more than 220 pounds. </T3>Shipments greater than 220pounds must always be accompanied by the generator-initiated tracking formwhich must remain with that shipment until it is accepted by the finaldestination facility. Individual shipments over 220 pounds may not be consolidatedonto another tracking form by the transporter. For each such shipment over220 pounds, the transporter shall sign the form when accepting the waste,leaving the designated copy with the generator. The remaining copies ofthe form must be maintained in the same vehicle as the waste it coversat all times (except as provided for in Subpart J for rail carriers) untilit is accepted by the destination facility. The waste is officially acceptedby that facility when the form is signed by a representative of the destinationfacility and a signed copy given to the transporter. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Transporter Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements </ITAG>a. <T3>Recordkeeping. </T3>Today's rule also specifies that all transporterswho transport regulated medical waste originated in a Covered State mustmaintain records of all transactions involving these materials. Copiesof all tracking forms that the transporter has signed must be kept forat least three (3) years from the date of signature; this includes allgenerator-initiated forms as well as any that the transporter has initiatedhimself. Additionally, copies of all logs pertaining to consolidation activities(whether for shipments of less than 50 pounds that are not accompaniedby tracking forms or for those of up to 220 pounds that are accompaniedby forms) must be maintained for a minimum of three (3) years from thedate of their initiation. Finally, the transporter must keep copies onfile of all reports that he is required to submit to EPA or any of theCovered States during the demonstration program; these will include allcopies of the transporter periodic reports as well as any other reports,as required by today's rule that relate to the medical waste tracking program(e.g., Exception Reports, Discrepancy Reports). b. <T3>Transporter periodic reports. </T3>The transporter must prepare andsubmit periodic reports to EPA and the appropriate State agency responsiblefor medical waste monitoring and enforcement concerning the managementof regulated medical waste. Transporters must prepare a separate reportfor each Covered State in which the transporter accepted regulated medicalwaste directly from a generator, and for each Covered State that the transporterhas accepted regulated medical waste from another transporter who acceptedwaste directly from a generator. (The transporter who accepted waste directlyfrom the generator may be the first of three or more transporters thatare involved in the transport of such waste. Each transporter involvedin the transport of the waste must report.) These reports, which will provideEPA and the State with information regarding implementation of the program,must contain the information required on the form in Appendix III to Part259. Use of this form is required. Reports must be submitted for the first,second, third, and fourth 180-day periods of the demonstration programand must be submitted 45 days after the last day of the reporting period.The report must be submitted to EPA, addressed to: Chief, Waste CharacterizationBranch, Office of Solid Waste, US EPA (OS-332), 401 M Street SW., Washington,DC 20460. Transporters must include their EPA Medical Waste IdentificationNumber on the report. One copy of the report also must be sent to the Directorof the State agency responsible for implementing the medical waste trackingregulations. EPA will publish a list of State agency addresses after the30 day petition-in/opt-out period. The information required includes the quantities of regulated medical waste(broken down into the ``untreated'' and ``treated'' categories) acceptedfrom each generator, by name and site, during the reporting period. Thesereports will provide EPA not only with a list of all generators enteringwaste into the tracking system, but also the quantity of regulated medicalwaste entering the system. EPA will use this information to help preparethe Reports to Congress required under Section 11008, and by the Statesor EPA to target inspection and compliance monitoring efforts.Transporters also must report on the disposition of regulated medical waste(i.e., whether the waste has been delivered to a treatment or disposalfacility, or to another transporter), again broken down into the ``untreated''or ``treated categories.'' This information, which will include both thenames and addresses of receiving facilities as well as waste quantity information,also will be used for the Reports to Congress and to target EPA or Stateinspection and enforcement efforts. The reports are intended to provide a picture of the regulated medicalwaste transportation system for such wastes generated in Covered States.The distinction between ``untreated'' and ``treated'' medical waste willallow EPA to assess changes in treatment practices over the life of theprogram. All of the information can be taken from the required trackingforms or logs; transporters should not need to generate new information.The reports must be submitted according to the schedule outlined above.The first report will provide EPA and the States with information on generatorsand treatment and disposal facilities so that the Agency can immediatelytarget public outreach efforts and make modifications to the system toimprove its efficiency. EPA believes there is a strong likelihood that,upon analysis of the first report, EPA will have identified all generators,treaters, and disposers of regulated medical waste. After this initialperiod, the reporting will meet enforcement needs and provide informationfor the Reports to Congress. These periodic reports will enable EPA andthe States to assess trends during the life of the program. EPA initially considered requiring that all generators, transporters andtreatment and disposal facilities submit detailed reports concerning theirhandling of regulated medical waste. However, the Agency was concernedabout the ability to assimilate the information from the estimated 150,000generators, transporters, and destination facilities within the CoveredStates. Since transportation is the essential link between generators andoff-site treatment and disposal, EPA believes that the most efficient meansof compiling information will be from the transporters. EPA anticipatesthat the total number of regulated medical waste transporters will numberless than a thousand. In summary, the Agency has attempted to minimize reporting requirementsin today's rule. However, EPA believes monitoring of waste movement isessential, and the transporter, as the central actor, is in the best positionto collect, compile, and report this information. Accordingly, EPA is usingits Section 11004(a) authority to require submission of these reports.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Delivery of Regulated Medical Waste Outside the United States (Section259.74(e)) </ITAG>The Agency is aware that regulated medical waste generated in several ofthe Covered States is being transported to Canada for treatment and disposal.In addition, EPA understands that similar waste generated in Canada isbeing transported for treatment and disposal into some of the Covered States.Although the Agency believes that the documentation and tracking of allsuch regulated medical waste from its point of generation to its pointof disposal may be advisable, the Medical Waste Tracking Act only providesthe authority for tracking regulated medical waste generated in CoveredStates. Today's regulations do not apply to waste generated in a CoveredState that is shipped internationally, once it leaves U.S. borders. Inthese cases, it is the responsibility of the last U.S. transporter (i.e.,the transporter who delivers the waste to another transporter, a transferfacility, or a destination facility in a foreign country) to sign the trackingform verifying that the waste has been delivered to a foreign transporteror destination facility, retain one copy of the signed tracking form, andreturn all remaining copies by mail to the generator. As noted elsewherein the Preamble, the Agency is requiring that the generator request writtenverification from the destination facility located in the foreign countrythat the waste was received by the facility. The Agency requests comments on the need for other requirements to ensurethat regulated medical wastes are properly managed when exported. For example,EPA could require that the generator have a contract with the foreign treatmentand destruction facility and/or the foreign disposal facility stipulatingthat the facility return a signed copy of the tracking form to the generator.I. Subpart I_Treatment, Destruction, and Disposal Facilities Today's regulations establish a demonstration tracking program that includesrequirements for intermediate handlers of regulated medical waste and fordestination facilities to ensure that regulated medical waste is trackedfrom the point of generation to the point of final disposal. The MWTA doesnot authorize or require EPA to establish regulations that address theactual treatment, destruction, or disposal of regulated medical waste.The requirements of Part 259 cease when regulated medical waste is disposedof at a landfill or the waste has been ``treated and destroyed'' by incinerationor other techniques. (See Preamble Section V.D. for a discussion of thecriteria or conditions that must be satisfied for medical waste to be consideredtreated and destroyed.) Facilities meeting these latter conditions includeincinerators and treatment facilities that, in addition to decontaminating,also destroy the regulated medical waste. Treatment, destruction, and disposalfacilities may be subject to local, State, or other Federal requirementsin addition to today's rules. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Applicability (Section 259.80) </ITAG>The provisions described in andSection; 259.80 of today's rule apply to destinationfacilities (treatment and destruction, and disposal facilities (includingincinerators)) and to intermediate handlers that receive regulated medicalwaste generated in a Covered State that is required to be accompanied bya tracking form. As described above, the demonstration tracking programrequires the tracking of regulated medical waste from the point of generationuntil such waste is delivered to the final disposal facility (or to incineratorsor other facilities that both treat and destroy such waste). The rulesdo not require the tracking of regulated medical waste after it has beenproperly incinerated, treated and destroyed, or disposed of. Thus, wastethat has been either treated or destroyed, but not both, must continueto be tracked until the waste reaches a destination facility. The requirementsapplicable to intermediate handlers and destination facilities, therefore,serve to ensure that facilities participating in the demonstration programproperly complete the tracking document and maintain all necessary recordsfor implementation of the program. Interstate transport of regulated medical waste is now occurring, and manyfacilities receiving regulated medical waste are not located in Statesparticipating in the demonstration program. Today's rule requires thatall intermediate handlers and destination facilities that accept regulatedmedical waste generated in a Covered State comply with Subpart I, whetherthey are located in a Covered State or a non-Covered State. This requirementis necessary to ensure that generators in Covered States receive a copyof the tracking form signed by the destination facility to which the wasteis delivered.In addition, the provisions of Subpart I are also applicable to on-sitetreatment and destruction and disposal facilities that accept regulatedmedical waste required to be accompanied by a tracking form from off-sitesources. Such facilities include on-site incinerators that burn regulatedmedical waste and facilities that treat and destroy the waste. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Types of Treatment, Destruction, and Disposal Facilities </ITAG>For purposes of today's rule, treatment, destruction, and disposal facilitiescan be differentiated into two distinct types: (a) Destination facilities_facilitiesthat either dispose of the regulated medical waste or that meet the ``treatand destroy'' criteria so that the regulated medical waste no longer needsto be tracked; and (b) Intermediate handlers_facilities where regulatedmedical waste is treated but not destroyed and facilities where regulatedmedical waste is destroyed, but not treated, thereby requiring that theregulated medical waste must continue to be tracked to its final disposalsite. Each type is discussed below. The reader should note that in additionto the Federal tracking requirements of today's rule, many States and localitieshave their own laws and regulations for treatment, destruction, and disposalfacilities which are unaffected by today's rule. a. <T3>Destination facilities. </T3>Included in this type are incinerators,treatment facilities that ``treat and destroy'' the waste, and disposalfacilities. Incinerators are subject to the demonstration program as medical wastetreatment facilities when they accept regulated medical waste. The MWTAspecifies that regulated medical waste must be tracked from its point ofgeneration through either disposal or incineration. By designating incinerationas an alternative end point, Congress intended that incinerators used totreat and destroy regulated medical waste must comply with the same basicrequirements for signing and returning the tracking form as disposal facilities(i.e., each is the final destination of the waste). Similarly regulated are those treatment facilities that subject the medicalwaste to a series of processes that both ``treat'' (e.g., steam autoclaving)and ``destroy'' (e.g., grinding or melting processes) the waste. Theseprocesses are similar to incinerators because they alleviate the potentialto cause adverse human health effects, physical hazards, and aestheticdegradation of the environment. EPA has therefore exempted the residualsof these processes under andSection; 259.30(c)(2)(iv). Regulated medicalwastes that have been subjected to processes that both treat and destroythe waste, remove the waste from the tracking requirements of today's rule.The requirements applicable to the above-mentioned destination facilitiesare identical under today's rule, since each type of facility serves asan end point for the tracking forms accompanying regulated medical waste.These requirements generally include signing and returning (mailing) trackingforms, signing return receipts in the case of wastes shipped by mail, discrepancyreporting, and maintaining the necessary records (e.g., keeping copiesof the tracking forms and discrepancy reports for three (3) years). b. <T3>Intermediate handlers. </T3>Included in this type are facilities thattreat regulated medical waste (disinfect or decontaminate) but do not destroyit or facilities that destroy the regulated medical waste but do not treatit. These intermediate handlers are required to initiate a new trackingform to accompany each shipment of treated or destroyed regulated medicalwaste from the intermediate handler's facility to the destination facility.They are, in effect, new generators of the regulated medical waste. Specifictracking form handling requirements have been established for intermediatehandlers to ensure that the original generator of the waste obtains a copyof the tracking form with the signature of the destination facility. Theserequirements are explained below, under Use of the Tracking Form (see andSection;259.81(c)). <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Use of the Tracking Form (andSection; 259.81) </ITAG>a. <T3>General. </T3>All destination facilities and intermediate handlersthat receive regulated medical waste generated in a Covered State accompaniedby a tracking form must satisfy several requirements related to the formand the waste it covers. Upon receipt, the owner or operator must determinethat the tracking form accurately reflects the waste received at the facilityboth in terms of the description of regulated medical waste specified onthe form (i.e., whether it is labeled properly as ``untreated'' or ``treated''),the number of containers, and the total quantity of the shipment. (Thereader should note that under State regulations, the owner or operatoralso may have to account for State-regulated medical waste listed in Box11(c) of the tracking form.) If the owner or operator discovers any discrepanciesbetween the information contained on the tracking form and the waste containedin the shipment, he must note the discrepancy on the tracking form. Whendiscrepancies are discovered (see discussion below), he must attempt toresolve these discrepancies by recounting or rechecking the tracking form(s),or, if the shipment was consolidated or remanifested, by checking the transporter'slog and/or the tracking forms initiated by the generator. Once a discrepancyhas been identified, the generator, transporter(s), and the owner or operatorshould take steps to resolve the discrepancy and/or locate the missingwaste. If the discrepancy cannot be resolved, the owner or operator ofthe intermediate handling facility or the destination facility is requiredto file a discrepancy report as described below (see also andSection; 259.82).Discrepancies that must be noted on the tracking form are differences ofeither quantity or description of regulated medical waste. For purposesof today's rule, discrepancies exist (for containerized waste) if thereis any variation in piece count (box, pail, or drum), or if containersare not labeled properly as untreated waste. Label discrepancies can beidentified through a visual inspection of the label on the outer most surfaceof the package and the description of the waste on the tracking form (Box11). If the material is untreated regulated medical waste, the label mustcontain the words ``Infectious Waste,'' or ``Medical Waste,'' or displaythe universal biohazard symbol. Packages containing treated regulated medicalwaste are not required to have a label. The Agency is not recommendingthat owners and operators open containers of waste to make further inspections,as this may increase occupational exposure to the waste. In addition to the discrepancies described above, arrival of improperlypackaged regulated medical waste or arrival of regulated medical wasteaccompanied by unsigned or otherwise incomplete tracking forms are alsodiscrepancies. The Agency believes it is important that the integrity ofthe packaging containing regulated medical waste be maintained from thepoint of generation to the point of treatment or disposal so that workersare not exposed to regulated medical waste. The Agency also believes thatit is the responsibility of all regulated medical waste handlers_generators,transporters, treaters, and disposers_to ensure proper packaging and containmentof the waste as it is transported and tracked through the management system.The Agency believes that an unsigned or incomplete tracking form is a significantcause for concern. It is an indication that shipping papers may have beenaltered or that regulated medical waste has been mishandled inadvertentlysomewhere between the point of generation and the point at which the wastereaches an intermediate handler or destination facility. The owner or operatorof a treatment or destruction facility, or a disposal facility is ideallyplaced to note such discrepancies. EPA is also concerned that, when regulated medical waste arrives at anintermediate handler or a destination facility unaccompanied by a trackingform, it is impossible for the owner or operator to fulfill his requirementto determine that the tracking form accurately reflects the waste listedon the form. He will be unable to check the piece count or to determinethat the waste is described appropriately as treated or untreated regulatedmedical waste. In these instances, if the owner or operator knows the wasteshould be accompanied by a tracking form and accepts it, he must file adiscrepancy report as described later in this Preamble. EPA notes thatit may be difficult for the owner or operator to identify regulated medicalwaste, except where the container bears a marking identifying the generatorand transporter. Finally, the owner or operator should follow any special instructions inBox 14 of the tracking form for oversized items, handling them accordingly.b. <T3>Destination facilities. </T3>Once the information contained on thetracking form has been verified or any apparent discrepancies noted, theowner or operator of the destination facility must sign and date each copyof the tracking form. This signature certifies that the waste describedby the tracking form has been received at the destination facility. Thefacility owner or operator must immediately give the transporter a signedcopy. This copy is the transporter's confirmation that he delivered thewaste as described on the tracking form or as otherwise noted in the discrepancybox. The owner or operator of the destination facility must then return a signedcopy of the tracking form within l5 days of acceptance of the waste eitherto the generator at the address indicated on the form or, in the case ofconsolidated or remanifested shipments or shipments remanifested by anintermediate handler, to the party that initiated the tracking form. (Thetransporter is then responsible for providing the original generator witha signed copy of the tracking document, as explained in Section V.H. ofthe Preamble.) If a transporter consolidated shipments or prepared thetracking form because the waste originated from generators of less than50 pounds per month, the tracking form must be returned to the transporterthat reassigned or consolidated the shipment. c. <T3>Intermediate handlers. </T3>Intermediate handlers, facilities thateither treat or destroy the regulated medical waste but do not do bothare required to continue to track the waste to a destination facility.These facilities are, in effect, new generators. Intermediate handlerswho only treat the regulated medical waste must initiate a new trackingform to indicate that the waste category changed from untreated to treated,and to indicate any changes in the number of containers and/or weight ofthe wastes being shipped to the destination facility. Intermediate handlerswho only destroy regulated medical waste must initiate a new tracking formto indicate the change in the number of containers and/or weight of regulatedmedical waste caused by the destruction process. These facilities alsomust meet all of the generator requirements under Subparts E and F of today'srule. In addition, intermediate handlers must maintain a log that correlatesthe waste accepted from each <T3>original </T3>generator to the waste shipments that he has initiated.The log must include the generator's name, State permit or identificationnumber, or if none, the generator's address, the date of shipment or thegenerator's unique tracking form number assigned to that shipment, andthe new tracking form number to which the waste was assigned. Intermediate handlers that initiate a new tracking form must retain theoriginal generator's tracking form until the new tracking form that heinitiated is signed by the destination facility and returned. Once theintermediate handler has received the signed copy of the tracking formfrom the destination facility, he must send a copy of the signed form,together with the original generator's tracking form, to the original generator.This process provides the original generator of the waste with assurancethat the waste was received by the destination facility (as required bysection 11003(a)).d. <T3>Certification of disposal. </T3>Discussions with members of the healthcare industry have indicated that many generators would prefer that thetracking form include a box for certification of disposal in addition tothe certification of acceptance. Several reasons were cited for this preference,including concern for a generator's liability in the event of mishandlingby the disposal facility and the fact that payment for disposal is oftencontingent upon a receipt of disposal certification. However, the Agencybelieves that this second certification is not necessary to meet the statutoryrequirement that the generator is assured that the disposal facility hasreceived the waste. If the generator wants certification of disposal, hecan stipulate the requirement through either a contract with the destinationfacility or by requesting such certification in the Special Handling andAdditional Instruction box on the tracking form. The Agency requests commentson the need for inclusion of a separate or distinct box for certifyingdisposal on the tracking form. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Tracking Form Discrepancies (Section 259.82) </ITAG>Upon discovering a discrepancy, as described above, between the trackingform and the actual shipment, the owner or operator of a facility firstmust attempt to reconcile the discrepancy and should do so as soon as possibleafter discovering the problem. For example, the facility should first tryto reconcile the discrepancy with the transporter by recounting the numberof containers, or by contacting the transporter to see if the missing package(s)or tracking forms were placed on a different transport vehicle. The facilityshould make telephone inquiries to the other parties in the chain of custody,and keep a written record of these inquiries and the information obtained.If the discrepancy cannot be reconciled within 15 days, the owner or operatorof the facility must notify the Regional Administrator for the Region inwhich the facility is located and the Regional Administrator and Statewhere the generator of the regulated medical waste is located. The notificationmust be in the form of a letter describing the discrepancy and effortsto resolve it. The letter also must contain a legible copy of the trackingform and/or shipping paper at issue, if one exists. In the case of acceptance of regulated medical waste unaccompanied by atracking form where the owner or operator knows that a tracking form isrequired, the owner or operator must describe the quantity of waste thathe received, the identity of the transporter who delivered the waste, andthe identity of the generators of the waste. As a courtesy the facilityalso should mail a copy of the discrepancy report to the relevant generator(s)and transporter(s). <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Recordkeeping Requirements (Section 259.83) </ITAG>The owner or operator of a destination facility or an intermediate handlerthat receives regulated medical waste generated in a Covered State andaccompanied by a tracking form must maintain records concerning the deliveryof each shipment of regulated medical waste. These records must be maintainedfor a minimum of three (3) years from the date of receipt of the waste.Information that must be maintained includes: (a) copies of all trackingforms and/or shipping papers; (b) copies of all discrepancy reports submitted;and (c) for generators who deliver waste directly to destination facilitiesand intermediate handlers as allowed under the provisions of andSection;259.51(a), a log which includes the information required in andSection; 259.83(b).<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Treatment, Destruction, and Disposal of Medical Waste </ITAG>The MWTA does not require or authorize EPA to establish standards for thetreatment, destruction, or disposal of medical waste. Rather, the Act focuseson tracking these wastes. Accordingly, treatment, destruction, and disposalstandards for regulated medical wastes are not included in today's rule.However, facilities are required to meet any specific local, State, orFederal requirements for the treatment, destruction, or disposal of regulatedmedical waste. Disposal facilities also must meet all applicable local,State, and Federal solid waste management requirements. Under section 4004 of RCRA (Subtitle D), all solid waste must be disposedof in a manner that poses no reasonable probability of causing adverseeffects to human health or the environment. Because solid waste classificationencompasses nearly all waste, including medical waste, this restrictioncomprises the minimal standard that all disposal facilities for regulatedmedical waste must meet. Practices that do not meet this standard are consideredby the Agency to constitute open dumping and thus are prohibited under4005 of RCRA. The Agency has established criteria, detailed in 40 CFR Part257, that specify general performance standards for solid waste disposalpractices and facilities. Currently, these criteria address facility location,impact on surface and ground water and on air quality, land applicationof solid waste, and other concerns. In addition, the Agency recently has proposed regulations revising theSubtitle D criteria for municipal waste landfills (53 FR 33314, August30, 1988). These proposed revisions, if adopted, would establish specificrequirements applicable to all municipal solid waste landfill facilities.These requirements include setting design goals for protecting groundwater,groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure and post-closurecare, and financial responsibility. The responsibility for implementing the Subtitle D regulations traditionallyhas fallen upon the States, which are required to establish solid wasteprograms that meet the Federal criteria. Many States, however, have gonewell beyond the Federal criteria in regulating solid waste management facilities.Additionally, the number of States that regulate medical waste is increasing;all of the States mentioned in Subtitle J either have such regulationsin place or have indicated they will soon regulate medical waste. Theseregulations typically are comprehensive, including requirements for treatmentof the waste (often specifying sterilization or incineration) prior todisposal, and for permitting the solid waste disposal facilities. Today'srule is intended to complement these State programs in providing for theeffective management of medical waste. Finally, in the MWTA Congress has expressed serious interest in the treatmentand disposal of medical waste. The Act requires that the Agency reportto Congress on current disposal methods and requirements, as well as onavailable treatment and disposal methods, and on the health impacts andcosts of current and alternative methods. The requirements of this Subpartare intended to provide some of the information necessary to develop suchreports. The Agency requests that commenters submit available informationon alternative treatment and destruction technologies, as well as on disposaltechnologies. EPA will use any information provided to develop, a modelState medical waste progran. J. Subpart J_Rail Shipments of Regulated Medical Waste (Section 259.90)Subpart J of today's rule establishes the procedures for handling the trackingform and recordkeeping requirements that rail carriers of regulated medicalwaste must follow. The requirements are identical to those establishedunder Subtitle C of RCRA for rail carriers. The Agency believes that theunique operational characteristics of the rail industry necessitate thatrail carriers be subject to somewhat different tracking and recordkeepingrequirements than those that apply to other transporters of regulated medicalwaste. Under today's rule, as under the hazardous waste regulations, rail transportersmay, under certain conditions, move regulated medical waste without actuallycarrying the tracking form (i.e., it can be sent ahead by mail). Also,shipments may be transferred between two rail transporters without obtainingthe accepting transporter's (rail carrier's) signature, if so directedon the manifest or tracking form. EPA explained the necessity and basisfor these special provisions on February 26, 1980, for hazardous wastetransporters (45 FR 12739), and the Agency believes similar provisionsare appropriate for regulated medical waste when it is transported by rail.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Relationship to Other EPA Programs  </ITAG>The regulations promulgated today for the medical waste tracking programare required by amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act(RCRA), one of several laws that EPA administers. Below is a discussionof other EPA programs that are related to the medical waste tracking programpromulgated today. A. Other Subtitles of RCRA <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Subtitle C_Hazardous Waste Management </ITAG>The definition of ``medical waste'' found in RCRA section 1004(40) specificallyexcludes hazardous waste identified or listed under Subtitle C of thatact. The implementing regulations at 40 CFR Part 261 identify characteristicsof hazardous waste and list specific hazardous wastes. A generator of asolid waste (which can be solid, semisolid, liquid, or contained gaseouswaste) must determine if the waste is hazardous under the Part 261 regulations.If the waste is a listed or characteristic hazardous waste as generated,it is not subject to regulation under the Part 259 regulations. In makingthis determination, the generator must use the Federal regulations defininghazardous waste. If the waste is not hazardous under Federal regulations,the generator proceeds to determine whether the waste is regulated medicalwaste. The hazardous waste programs in some States cover a broader universe ofwastes than the Federal program. The wastes that are regulated as hazardousby certain States, but not by the Federal program, may also be regulatedmedical wastes, because the ``hazardous waste'' exclusion in section 1004(40)refers to Federally-regulated hazardous waste. In the case of mixtures of medical waste and hazardous waste identifiedor listed in Part 261, if the mixture is subject to the hazardous wastemanifest requirements, it is exempt from the medical waste tracking requirements.Duplicative manifesting is unnecessary and inconsistent with Congressionalintent, given the exclusion of hazardous waste from the definition of ``medicalwaste.'' However, hazardous waste that is exempted from the RCRA SubtitleC manifest requirements does not present the problem of duplicative trackingwhen it is mixed with regulated medical waste. Therefore, if the mixtureof regulated medical waste and hazardous waste is not required to be trackedunder the Subtitle C rules, it must be managed and tracked as regulatedmedical waste. For example, if a hazardous waste is exempt from regulationbecause it is generated by a conditionally exempt small quantity generator(40 CFR 261.5) but is mixed with a regulated medical waste, then the entirequantity of waste must be handled as regulated medical waste. Certain cytotoxic agents, including the following, are covered under RCRASubtitle C hazardous waste regulations: Cyclophosphamide (also known asCytoxin) (U058); Daunomycin (U059); Melphalan (U150); Mitomycin C (U010);Streptozotocin (U206); and Uracil Mustard (U237). The Agency will determinein further study and evaluation whether additional cytotoxins should beregulated under Subtitle C. The Agency requests comment from the regulatedcommunity regarding the proper management of cytotoxic and antineoplasticdrugs. Residues from the treatment of medical wastes may become hazardous wastes.For example, incineration reduces the volume of a waste, and the volumereduction may cause a concentration of metal constituents. Thus, it ispossible that a medical waste regulated under Part 259 could become a hazardouswaste if incinerated, and the resulting ash would be required to be managedas a hazardous waste under Subtitle C (40 CFR Parts 260 through 272). Also, the reader may note several parallels between the Subtitle C (hazardouswaste) and Subtitle J (medical waste) regulatory programs. However, differencesin statutory language and Congressional intent have resulted in a programfor medical waste that is different from the hazardous waste program. SectionIV of this Preamble details the differences between the hazardous wastemanifest and the medical waste tracking form. Some examples of the differencesidentified in section V of this Preamble are the use of forms, and thevarious definitions for transportation and treatment. Finally, under section 11010(c), EPA retains authority to list medicalwastes under RCRA section 3001, if necessary. Available data do not suggestthat such a listing is warranted. The Agency will reconsider this decisionafter collection of additional information over the next 2 years duringthe development of the interim and final reports on medical waste requiredfor submission to Congress. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Subtitle D_State or Regional Solid Waste Plans </ITAG>Subtitle D of RCRA contains objectives for environmentally sound nonhazardoussolid waste resource recovery and disposal methods. To satisfy one of theseobjectives, EPA has promulgated criteria for determining which land disposalfacilities are sanitary landfills (40 CFR Part 257). Thus, solid wastedisposal at a facility meeting the sanitary landfill criteria poses noreasonable probability of adverse effects on human health or the environment.Medical wastes regulated under Part 259 may be disposed in facilities thatmeet the sanitary landfill criteria, subject to State or local restrictionson such disposal. EPA has not promulgated requirements for any form oftreatment (such as autoclaving or incineration) prior to land disposal;however, a State or locality may enact such treatment requirements. Finally, medical wastes not listed under Part 259, Subpart D, of today'srule remain subject to the requirements of Subtitle D. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Subtitle G_Miscellaneous Provisions </ITAG>Since medical waste is a solid waste, EPA retains authority under RCRAsection 7003 to respond to situations in which past or present solid wastehandling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal may present imminentand substantial endangerment to human health or the environment. EPA mayeither issue an administrative order or file suit in the United StatesDistrict Court to obtain any necessary relief. The Agency must providenotice to the affected State of any suit under this section. This authoritysupplements section 11005 medical waste enforcement authority. B. CERCLA The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Actof 1980, as amended (CERCLA), also known as Superfund, provides for emergencyand long-term cleanup of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants.Section 104(14) of this act defines ``hazardous substances,'' and 40 CFR302.4 specifically lists or references all CERCLA hazardous substances.``Pollutant or contaminant,'' as defined in section 101(33) of CERCLA,includes disease-causing agents. There is no tabulation of substances thatfits the definition of ``pollutant or contaminant.'' The broad languagein the definition could include pathogens, bacteria, and viruses. Under CERCLA section 104, EPA may clean up releases or  threatened releasesof either hazardous substances or pollutants/contaminants that may presentan imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare. (Thisauthority and CERCLA section 106, which authorizes injunctive relief againstresponsible parties for releases of hazardous substances, is similar tothe RCRA section 7003 authority described above.) Medical waste could containhazardous substances, or it could contain pollutants or contaminants. Thus,certain releases of medical waste may be subject to Superfund authority.The Part 259, Subpart D, listing of medical wastes promulgated today, however,does not trigger the addition of wastes to the 40 CFR 302.4 list of hazardoussubstances (in contrast to Subtitle C listings). Today's rule does notalter CERCLA authority or the CERCLA liabilities of any persons handlingmedical waste. In addition, the hazardous material regulations of the U.S.Department of Transportation (which are tied to CERCLA listings) are notaffected by today's rules.C. Clean Air Act Currently, the Clean Air Act regulations include a New Source PerformanceStandard for incinerators of solid waste, of which 50 percent or more ismunicipal waste, charging more than 50 tons per day, if those incineratorswere constructed or modified after August 17, 1971. The regulations, foundat 40 CFR 60.50, specify a particulate matter emission limit. Many healthcare facility incinerators have a lower charging rate and would not beregulated under this performance standard. However, they may be subjectto other State or local air pollution control regulations, including StateImplementation Plans which are Federally enforceable under section 110of the Clean Air Act. The regulations promulgated today for the medical waste demonstration programdo not require a particular treatment technology for medical waste. CertainStates, however, have taken steps to limit land disposal of untreated medicalwaste. The actions of these States could result in increased use of incinerationor other treatment techniques. In addition, Congress directed that incinerationresidues do not require tracking under the medical waste demonstrationprogram. This exemption may encourage generators to incinerate their medicalwaste. EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards has begun investigatingthe risks associated with hospital waste incineration and is developinga training course for hospital waste incinerator operators. The Agencymay decide to develop standards for these sources under the Clean Air Act.D. Water Pollution Control <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Clean Water Act </ITAG>This law establishes the requirement that discharges of pollutants, exceptin compliance with the Act, are unlawful, and further establishes programsto control the discharges of pollutants to navigable waters. The pretreatmentprogram establishes standards for the introduction of pollutants into publiclyowned treatment works (section 307). Direct discharges of pollutants tonavigable waters require a permit incorporating technology-based limitationsand any more stringent limitations necessary to comply with State waterquality standards. Recent amendments to the Clean Water Act prohibit the discharge of medicalwaste to navigable waters (United States Public Vessel Medical Waste Anti-DumpingAct of 1988, Public Law 100-688, Title III, Subtitle B, section 3202).The Agency will be addressing these amendments in a rulemaking amendingits National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) regulations.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987 (Pub.L. 100-220) </ITAG>Title II of this Act requires several activities to be conducted and isdivided into three subtitles. Subtitle A requires the U.S. Coast Guard to prepare regulations to implementthe 1978 Protocol Relating to The International Convention for the Preventionof Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), relating to disposal of wastes from vessels.These regulations were proposed in 1988. Subtitle B requires the Environmental Protection Agency and the CommerceDepartment's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to study thesources and effects of plastic materials on the environment, includingthe marine environment,  and on waste disposal. A public education programwhich encourages citizen pollution patrols is also required to be developedunder this Subtitle. The objective of the citizen pollution patrols isto assist State and local officials in monitoring and cleaning up oceanand shoreline pollution. These activities are underway. Subtitle C includes the development of a plan specific to the restorationof water quality in the New York Bight. All three subtitles include plastics-related activities which will aidefforts to reduce the pollution of the marine environment with medicalwaste. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 </ITAG>This Act prohibits the transportation of materials from the United Statesfor the purpose of ocean dumping unless authorized by a permit. Recentamendments to this law prohibit the issuance of a permit for the transportationof medical wastes for the purpose of dumping. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. United States Public Vessel Medical Waste Anti-Dumping Act of 1988</ITAG>Vessels that are owned, chartered or operated by the U.S. Government, andthat are not engaged in commercial service, are prohibited, except in limitedspecific circumstances, from disposing into ocean waters potentially infectiousmedical waste generated on board the vessel. EPA, the Department of Defense,and affected agencies must publish guidance to implement this law. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Shore Protection Act of 1988 </ITAG>This law requires vessels (other than public vessels) to obtain permitsfor transporting municipal or commercial solid wastes in coastal waters.The law specifies loading, securing, unloading, and clean-up proceduresfor waste sources, vessels, and receiving facilities. It also requiresEPA, in consultation with the Department of Transportation, to promulgateregulations implementing these requirements. E. EPA Research Activities The Agency's research facilities are conducting studies to assess currentmedical waste incineration practices for improving combustion and to assessrisks from incineration of medical waste. In addition, EPA is collectingand evaluating information to meet the requirements under the MWTA forthe Reports to Congress. F. EPA's Office of International Activities Subtitle J has no specific provisions for imports and exports of medicalwaste, except a requirement that EPA consult with the International JointCommission (IJC) to determine how to monitor disposal of medical wasteemanating from Canada. Furthermore, the Act implicitly requires the Agencyto track medical wastes generated in a State subject to the demonstrationprogram and disposed of in a foreign country. It is the Office of InternationalActivities' (OIA) responsibility to make certain that the concerns regardingthe import and export of medical wastes are addressed. EPA is currently consulting with the Canadian government through the OIAto identify and discuss issues related to the transboundary movement ofregulated medical wastes between the United States and Canada. The Agencyintends to use this information from Canada in assessing the need for aprogram which controls the export and import of regulated medical wastes.This information will be summarized in the Reports to Congress. EPA, throughthe Department of State, is providing a copy of this interim final ruleto the IJC to meet the requirements of the MWTA.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Relationship to Other Federal Regulatory Programs </ITAG>This section discusses the relationship between the rule EPA is promulgatingtoday for medical waste tracking and the regulatory programs of other Federalagencies that in one way or another, may apply to the same wastes. In general,the fact that another set of Federal regulations applies to wastes doesnot mean that the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) does notapply. In some cases, RCRA regulations apply independently of, and in additionto, other Federal rules. However, the RCRA definition of solid waste, givenin section 1004(27), excludes certain materials regulated under other lawsfrom RCRA coverage. Further, section 11002(b) of RCRA allows EPA to excludemedical waste that does not pose a substantial hazard to human health orthe environment if improperly managed. In exercising this authority, EPAconsidered whether existing Federal regulatory programs may provide adequateprotection for some wastes, making RCRA Subtitle J regulation unnecessary.A. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Certain waste streams may contain materials that are source, special nuclear,or by-product material, as defined in the Atomic Energy Act, and also maycontain materials that meet the definition of medical waste in section1004(40) of RCRA. These wastes are subject to regulation under both laws;if one law's requirements are more stringent, those requirements supersedeand supplement the less stringent ones. As explained previously, generatorsmay treat and destroy their regulated medical wastes, if they so choose,thus making their mixed radioactive and medical waste subject only to NuclearRegulatory Commission requirements. Otherwise, such wastes are subjectto both sets of rules. EPA has reviewed the NRC regulations and finds that, while there are similaritiesbetween EPA and NRC requirements, there are also several significant differences,particularly with respect to labeling, manifesting, and packaging. Becausetoday's rule does not exempt radioactive medical waste, EPA is requiringgenerators of mixed radioactive and medical waste to meet both EPA andNRC labeling, manifesting, and packaging requirements. For a complete descriptionof the applicable NRC regulations, refer to 10 CFR Part 20 and 10 CFR Part61. Some important areas where NRC regulations are clearly distinct andmore stringent than EPA regulations are discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Labeling </ITAG>The low-level radioactive waste category (that which is suitable for near-surfacelandfill) is broken down by the NRC into three classes_A, B, and C_accordingto its level of radioactivity. As specified in 10 CFR 20.311(d), it isthe responsibility of the generator to classify the waste properly. Radioactivemedical waste is most often Class A (the least radioactive) waste. In anycase, as specified in 10 CFR 61.55 and andSection; 61.57, it must be labeledappropriately, in addition to the labeling requirements of Part 259, SubpartE, promulgated today. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Manifesting </ITAG>The NRC requires a shipping manifest for all radioactive waste destinedfor a licensed land disposal facility. An EPA medical waste tracking formis sufficient for this requirement, provided that certain additional informationas described below is recorded in Box 14 (Special Handling Instructionsand Additional Information) of the medical waste tracking form. The trackingform must indicate, as completely as practicable, a physical descriptionof the waste, the volume of the waste, the radionuclide identity and quantity,the total radioactivity, and the principal chemical form. Generators mayattach a separate sheet with this information to the Medical Waste TrackingForm. NRC requires that the solidification agent for liquid wastes must be specified.Waste containing more than 0.1 percent chelating agents by weight mustbe identified and the percentage weight of the chelating agent estimated.Again, all of this information can be included in Box 14 or on a separatesheet. These and other NRC tracking requirements are specified in 10 CFR20.311. NRC's exception reporting requirement described in 10 CFR 20.311(h) isparticularly noteworthy and is more stringent than the EPA medical wasteexception reporting requirement. Any shipment for which acknowledgmentof receipt by the disposal facility is not received by the generator within20 days must be investigated by the generator, traced, and reported. Intoday's rule, EPA sets forth a requirement that the exception reportingprocess begins after 35 days. Therefore, NRC's 20-day investigation requirementis more stringent and takes precedence, but if the exception is not resolvedwithin 45 days, then EPA's exception reporting requirements also wouldhave to be met, in addition to NRC's reporting requirements. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Packaging </ITAG>NRC requires that all classes of radioactive waste be handled and packagedaccording to specific requirements. These requirements are intended toprovide stability to the waste, to facilitate handling at the disposalsite, and to ensure the health and safety of personnel at the disposalsite. EPA's and NRC's objectives in providing requirements for proper wastepackaging are consistent with each other. However, to protect personnelhandling and disposing of the waste, NRC requires waste which containshazardous, biological, pathogenic, or infectious material to be treatedto reduce, to the maximum extent practicable, the potential hazard fromthe nonradiological materials. This requirement is more stringent thanEPA's and is in addition to the requirements promulgated today. Other important handling and packaging requirements that are more stringentthan EPA's and must be followed for radioactive medical waste include thefollowing: waste must not be packaged for disposal in cardboard or fiberboardboxes; liquid waste must be solidified or packaged in sufficient absorbentmaterial to absorb twice the volume of the liquid; solid waste containingliquid shall contain as little freestanding and noncorrosive liquid asis reasonably achievable, but in no case shall the liquid exceed one (1)percent of the volume; waste must have structural stability, which canbe provided by the waste form itself, by processing the waste to a stableform, or by placing the waste in a disposal container or structure thatprovides stability after disposal. These and other waste handling and packagingrequirements are specified in 10 CFR 61.56. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Limitation of Generator's Disposal Options </ITAG>Today's medical waste tracking regulations do not restrict the treatmentor disposal options the generator may choose, although generators may belimited by State regulations. However, the NRC regulations, in some cases,limit the generator's disposal options. These requirements are more stringentand are in addition to the requirements promulgated today.B. United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Animals With Communicable Diseases </ITAG>Certain animal wastes are regulated by USDA under 9 CFR Parts 50 through56. According to the rules, contaminated materials must be cleaned anddisinfected, or in some cases destroyed. A USDA or State veterinary officialdetermines which materials must be disinfected. Carcasses of animals killedbecause of exposure to certain diseases are sometimes sent for incinerationor burial. The USDA regulations require Federal or State employees to supervisethe incineration or burial and to prepare reports identifying the animaland its disposition. However, USDA regulations do not require trackingof the carcasses. The area of overlap between the USDA rules and today'srule is minimal because the waste regulated by EPA under Class 5 are contaminatedanimal carcasses, body parts, and bedding of animals exposed to infectiousagents during research, production of biological, or testing of pharmaceuticals.Although no exemption was included in today's rule, EPA requests commenton whether animal carcasses that are both regulated medical waste underandSection; 259.30(a) and regulated by USDA should be exempted from part259 requirements. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Veterinary Biological Products </ITAG>Products such as vaccines and serums, intended for use in the diagnosis,treatment, or prevention of animal diseases, are regulated by USDA. A warninglabel, required on substances containing viable or dangerous organisms(9 CFR Part 112), instructs the user to burn the container and all unusedcontents. USDA also regulates imports of some veterinary biological productswhich are classified as wastes if they are imported without appropriatepermits and are then sent for destruction. Today's medical waste trackingregulations supplement these existing USDA waste management requirements.C. Department of Labor (DOL)_Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA) OSHA regulations, specifically 29 CFR Part 1910, Subparts I and J, includea variety of general requirements for worker protection. Personal protectiveequipment, such as eye protection and respirators, is required when necessary.For all places of employment, waste removal must be conducted to keep thework environment sanitary. Special tags and signs are required to identifyequipment, rooms, materials, and experimental animals that contain, orare contaminated with, biological hazards. OSHA is developing regulations to protect health care workers from thetransmission of blood-borne infectious diseases (52 FR 45438, November27, 1987). A draft of the proposed regulation was released to the publicand is available from the OSHA Docket Office ((202) 532-7894; Docket H-370).Additionally, the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services (HHS)have initiated efforts to educate health care workers concerning blood-bornedisease (see 52 FR 41888, October 30, 1987). To the extent that workers are protected by OSHA's regulations, some regulationsfor hazard identification and protective clothing already exist. The packagingrequirements for sharps and fluids in today's rule also should serve toprotect waste handlers. Finally, OSHA is considering the use of the universalbiohazard symbol in certain workplace situations. This is compatible withtoday's EPA rule, which specifies that symbol as one means of identifyingpackages of medical waste. D. Department of Health and Human Services <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) </ITAG>The FDA regulates the production of biological substances for preventing,treating, or curing human diseases or injuries. Facilities developing biologicalproducts are licensed by the FDA, and they must meet standards for cleanlinessand timely, sanitary trash disposal.Laboratories conducting studies to support research or product marketingapplications also are required to meet certain standards. If they do notmeet these criteria, the validity of the studies may be questioned andthe studies may be disqualified. Thus, both the production facilities andlaboratories must comply with animal waste and general refuse storage anddisposal standards. (See 21 CFR 58.43 and andSection;andSection; 211.50, 211.56,and 606.40). For wastes shipped off-site that fall into one of today's regulated medicalwaste categories, today's regulations impose packaging, segregation, labeling,and tracking form requirements, and supplement the FDA rules. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Public Health Service (PHS) </ITAG>Interstate shipments of etiologic agents are regulated by the Public HealthService. An ``etiologic agent'' is defined in PHS regulations (42 CFR 72.1)as a viable microorganism or its toxin which causes, or may cause, humandisease. Shipments of certain etiologic agents must meet packaging requirementsand must be labeled with a symbol for biological hazards. A sender alsomust receive notification that the shipment has arrived at its destination.If the notification is not received, the sender must notify the Centersfor Disease Control (CDC). Imports of etiological agents and human disease vectors are prohibitedunless accompanied by a permit. Human remains from persons who died ofcertain communicable diseases also are prohibited from importation unlessthey have been cremated, or embalmed and placed in a sealed casket, orare accompanied by a permit. EPA has determined that etiologic agents need not be regulated under theEPA medical waste tracking program if they are subject to PHS and Departmentof Transportation (DOT) rules for interstate shipments of etiologic agents.(See the discussion in section V.D. of this Preamble and paragraph E ofthis section.) <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) </ITAG>To participate in the Medicare program, health care facilities are requiredto comply with specific conditions of participation or coverage that specifyvarious patient health and safety requirements. Generally, with respectto waste disposal, these conditions require health care facilities to meetany State or local licensing requirements, to have procedures for proper,routine storage and prompt disposal of trash, and to have policies andprocedures concerning infection control. The specific conditions of participation or coverage for the various providertypes may be found at 42 CFR 405 Subpart L, Home Health Agencies; SubpartM, Independent Laboratories; Subpart N, Portable X-ray Services; SubpartQ, Clinics, Rehabilitation Agencies, and Public Health Agencies as Providersof Outpatient Physical Therapy and/or Speech Pathology Services, and OutpatientPhysical Therapy Services Furnished by Physical Therapists in IndependentPractice; Subpart U, End Stage Renal Disease Facilities; Subpart X, RuralHealth Clinic Services; 42 CFR Part 416, Ambulatory Surgical Services;42 CFR Part 418, Hospice Care; 42 CFR Part 482, Hospitals; 42 CFR Part483, Subpart B (redesignated on February 2, 1989, 54 FR 5316), Long TermCare Facilities; and 42 CFR Part 485, Specialized Providers. E. Department of Transportation (DOT) <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Hazardous Materials Shipments </ITAG>DOT regulates the transportation of hazardous materials in commerce (49CFR Parts 171 to 179). The regulations address: (a) Interstate transportationof hazardous materials by motor vehicle, rail car, aircraft and vessel;and (b) intrastate transportation of certain hazardous materials (hazardouswastes, hazardous substances, and flammable cryogenic liquids in portabletanks and cargo tanks) by motor vehicle. One class of hazardous materials is the ``etiologic agents'' hazard class.As currently defined in 49 CFR 173.386, an ``etiologic agent'' means aviable microorganism, or its toxin, which causes or may cause human disease,and is limited to those agents listed in 42 CFR 72.3 of the regulationsof the Department of Health and Human Services. The list in 42 CFR 72.3includes many bacterial, fungal, viral and rickettsial agents. EPA has determined that etiologic agents that are wastes are not regulatedmedical wastes if they are shipped in accordance with DOT's regulationsfor etiologic agents. EPA made this deternination because DOT's regulationsfor shipping etiologic agents, in combination with the Public Health Serviceregulations discussed previously, are generally more stringent than theregulations promulgated today. DOT's regulations for etiologic agents specify that no person may shipa package containing over four liters gross volume of an etiologic agent.The packaging must meet requirements specified in 49 CFR 173.24 and 173.387,and must be labeled with the etiologic agents/biomedical material labelas specified in 49 CFR 173.388. In the event of fire, breakage, spillage,or suspected contamination involving etiologic agents during the courseof transportation (including loading, unloading and temporary storage),the carrier must notify DOT by telephone at (800) 424-8802 or (202) 267-2675,or the Centers for Disease Control at (404) 633-5513 (49 CFR 171.15). Thetelephone notice must be followed by a written report (49 CFR 171.16).DOT has proposed to broaden its definition of ``etiologic agent'' and toeliminate an exception for cultures of etiologic agents of 50 millilitersor less total quantity in one outside package (53 FR 45525, November 10,1988). DOT also plans to reconsider other aspects of its regulations forthe transportation of etiologic agents. EPA notes as a point of clarification that the rules promulgated todaydo not add any additional materials to the list of etiologic agents thatare subject to DOT's Hazardous Materials Regulations, nor do the rulescause any additional materials to come under DOT regulation. Today's medicalwaste tracking rules are independent of the DOT Hazardous Materials Regulations.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. MARPOL 73/78 </ITAG>The Protocol of 1978, relating to the International Convention for thePrevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (MARPOL 73/78), is an internationaltreaty for preventing ship generated ocean pollution by oil, noxious liquidsubstances, harmful substances, sewage, and garbage. The section of thetreaty that seeks to prevent garbage pollution is found in Annex V, recentlyin force and incorporated into U.S. law as the Act to Prevent Pollutionfrom Ships (33 U.S.C. 1901-1911). The U.S. Coast Guard has initiated arulemaking to address garbage disposal (53 FR 43622, October 27, 1988).The Coast Guard regulations will apply to all ship-generated garbage, includingregulated medical waste. Ships that are owned or operated by the UnitedStates and that are in noncommercial service will be subject to compliancewith Annex V on a delayed compliance schedule. EPA rules supplement theseCoast Guard rules by regulating the medical waste brought ashore in a CoveredState.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Federal Facilities </ITAG>Under section 11006 of the MWTA, Federal facilities managing regulatedmedical waste generated in a Covered State are subject to all Federal,State, interstate, and local requirements applicable to the managementof such wastes and are thus subject to today's rule. This inclusion ofFederal facilities in the demonstration tracking program is intended toensure that Federal facilities generating or otherwise handling regulatedmedical waste are subject to the same level of regulation as non-Federalinstitutions. The participation of these facilities is important if thedemonstration program is to capture all of the medical waste generatedin the Covered States. In addition, Congress has indicated that Federalfacilities should set an example in the proper management of medical waste(see 134 Cong. Rec. H 9539, Oct. 4, l988). Under today's rule, Federal facilities located in a Covered State mustcomply with all Federal, State, interstate, and local requirements applicablein that State, including regulations of the Federal demonstration program.If a State elects not to participate in the program and opts out, the medicalwaste generated by the Federal facilities located in the State will notbe subject to the demonstration program. In addition to expressly subjecting Federal facilities in demonstrationStates to medical waste regulations, the MWTA also waives all immunityfor the United States and its agents, employees, or officers from suit,process, or sanction of any State or Federal court with respect to theenforcement of applicable medical waste regulations. This waiver ensuresthat Federal facilities are subject to the same legal deterrents with regardto violating medical waste regulations as non-Federal facilities. However, the MWTA does provide for a potential limited exemption for Federalfacilities from medical waste regulation. As noted in Section 11006 ofRCRA Subtitle J, summarized in Section II.B. of this Preamble, the Presidentmay exempt Federal facilities under the Executive Branch from compliancewith medical waste management requirements if he determines that such anexemption is in the paramount interest of the United States. Such an exemptioncan only be for one (1) year. Additional exemptions are allowed, but onlyif the President makes a new determination of need, and then only for aone (1) year period. The President must report to Congress each Januaryon the exemptions to Federal facilities granted under this authority inthe previous year, and state the reasons for granting such exemptions.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Joint Federal and State Implementation </ITAG>Several implementation issues have arisen because of interstate movementof medical waste. These are discussed below. A. Regulatory Authority Many States have begun regulating medical wastes under their own laws.Section 11007(b) of RCRA reserves for States and localities the abilityto adopt and enforce their own laws. Any State or local requirement maybe enforced only by that State or locality. One specific limitation on the regulatory authority of States under RCRAsection 11007(c) is the use of a uniform medical waste tracking form. Thisform must be identical in content and format to the Federal form when itis required from a person subject to the Subtitle J regulations. However,States may require supplemental information (e.g., additional reports orsupplemental sheets to the tracking form). EPA's experience with the hazardous waste manifest system has shown thatuniformity in tracking form requirements is necessary to reduce conflictingand overlapping State requirements. (See 47 FR 9336, March 4, 1982, and49 FR 10490, March 20, 1984, for further information on the need for uniformityin hazardous waste tracking forms.) When non-Covered States require a tracking form for regulated medical wastegenerated in a Covered State, but transported into or through their jurisdictions,they also are bound by the section 1l007(c) requirement that the trackingform be identical to the Federal form in content and format. Therefore,regulated medical waste generated in a Covered State and shipped to a non-CoveredState may only be accompanied by a tracking form identical to the Federalform. If regulated medical waste is generated, transported, treated, ordisposed only in non-Covered States, then those States may impose additionaltracking requirements on the waste and are not limited by section 11007(c)of RCRA. In some instances, medical waste will be generated in a non-Covered Stateand transported through or into a Covered State. While the waste is inthe non-Covered State, that State can impose its own tracking requirements.Once the waste leaves the non-Covered State and enters a Covered State,it will be presumed to have been generated in that Covered State. (Seethe discussion in Section IV.A. of this Preamble.) This presumption maybe rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that the waste was generatedoutside the Covered State. Shipping papers or other documentation accompanyingthe shipment will thus be necessary to rebut this presumption; the burdenis on the regulated party. In the absence of such documentation, the transporteris subject to, and must comply with, all applicable management and trackingrequirements in today's rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">B.</ITAG><T3> Enforcement Authority </T3>Section 11005 of the Medical Waste Tracking Act gives the Administratorauthority to assess civil penalties, to seek injunctive relief in UnitedStates District Court for past or current violations, and to seek criminalpenalties for knowing violations of the Act. Section 11004 gives the Administrator,or his representative, authority to conduct inspections and gather informationon medical waste. EPA will include a copy of its enforcement strategy in the docket for thisrulemaking and will provide copies of its strategy for implementing themedical waste regulations to the Regions and States prior to the effectivedate of today's rule. Definition of the EPA and State roles in enforcement,information collection/management, and outreach are the major issues thatwill be addressed in the strategy. As part of today's rule, EPA is broadening the scope of the applicabilityof the consolidated rules of practice governing the administrative assessmentof civil penalties and the revocation and suspension of permits, 40 CFRpart 22. The consolidated rules will govern enforcement actions taken pursuantto section 11005 of RCRA. The consolidated rules of practice are applicableonly to enforcement actions initiated by the Administrator.EPA is issuing the rule on an interim final basis pursuant to 5 U.S.C.553(b) (A) and (B), which allows the issuance of rules without prior noticeand comment where the rules concern agency practice or procedure or wherethe Agency finds for good cause that prior notice and comment is unnecessary.Both of these criteria are met by these rules. Use of the ConsolidatedRules on an interim basis will allow EPA to begin prompt implementationof the administrative penalty authority provided in the Medical Waste TrackingAct. The Consolidated Rules, codified at 40 CFR Part 22, provide uniformprocedures and were promulgated after notice and opportunity for comment.For these reasons, EPA believes that notice and comment on this rule is``unnecessary'' under section 553 of the APA.RCRA section 11005(a) also provides that civil penalties assessed by theUnited States for violations of Subtitle J shall be assessed in accordancewith the Administrator's ``RCRA Civil Penalty Policy,'' as such policymay be amended from time to time. EPA issued its presently applicable ``RCRACivil Penalty Policy'' on May 18, 1984, as an internal Agency Guidance.A copy of the policy is included in the docket for this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">X. Regulatory Impacts </ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291_Regulatory Impact Executive Order 12291 requires that federal regulatory agencies determinewhether a new regulation will be classified as a ``major rule.'' EPA mustconduct a Regulatory Impact Analysis for all major rules the Agency promulgates.The Administrator has determined that today's final rule is not a majorrule, because it has total estimated impact costs of less than $100 millionper year. This conclusion is based on a cost analysis of today's rule.Therefore, EPA has not conducted a full Regulatory Impact Analysis. EPAhas analyzed the costs and potential benefits of today's rule, but hasnot assessed the impact of the costs on affected businesses. This sectionprovides the methodology and results of the Agency's cost analysis andthe results of the benefit analysis. The cost analysis involved developing cost estimates for management practicesrequired by today's rule for the 10 states targeted for involvement inthe demonstration program. Cost estimates will change if any of the CoveredStates opt out of the demonstration program, or if any other states optin. State administrative costs as well as potential indirect costs associatedwith changes in waste management practices have not been analyzed; theircombined effects on the costs of the rule are unclear. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Cost Methodology </ITAG>In estimating the costs imposed on the regulated community by today's interimfinal rule, the Agency focused on estimating only the direct costs incurredthrough compliance with the rule (i.e., those costs incurred directly bycomplying with the explicit requirements of the rule) for the ten CoveredStates. The approach EPA developed involved the following steps: (1) Characterizingthe regulated community in terms of the numbers and types of generators,and the numbers of transporters affected; (2) estimating the medical wastegeneration rates for each of the generator categories and their rate ofwaste shipments transported off site; (3) accounting for both current stateregulations and existing waste management practices governing medical wastesthat, for the purposes of this analysis, are similar to the requirementsof today's rule; and (4) estimating direct compliance costs for packaging,tracking, generator recordkeeping for generators of less than 50 poundsof regulated medical waste per month, transporter recordkeeping and reporting,and incinerator recordkeeping and reporting. In this cost analysis, EPA did not address any of the potential indirectcost effects of the tracking system. For example, medical waste disposalcapacity in the demonstration States may be reduced if landfill facilitiesbecome more reluctant to accept medical wastes due to the associated increasedlabor load and heightened public awareness the rule will create (i.e.,the combination of packaging, labeling, and tracking requirements may causeincreasing numbers of landfill owner/operators to refuse handling medicalwastes). As a result, medical waste disposal costs could increase. On theother hand, increased use of alternate treatment technologies would decreasethe amount of waste regulated under today's rule and thus decrease compliancecosts. For example, both on-site incineration and treatment and destructionexempt waste from today's rule. The combined effects of indirect changesin waste management practices on the costs of the rule are unclear. TheAgency solicits comment on these other indirect costs, particularly interms of cost and price data and how the tracking requirements will affectdisposal practices. The comments received on the rule and the reportingrequirements should provide the Agency information to assess the effectsof the tracking rule on existing disposal practices. This assessment willbe included in the subsequent Report to Congress. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Direct Compliance Costs </ITAG>To estimate direct compliance costs, EPA first divided each of the majorrequirements of the rule into its component tasks and estimated the laborhours and material costs associated with completion of each task. The requirementsof the rule fall into five categories: packaging, tracking, incinerationrecordkeeping and reporting, generator recordkeeping (for generators ofless than 50 pounds per month), and transporter reporting and recordkeeping.Costs for the first four categories are estimated for generators; onlycosts for tracking are estimated for transporters and disposers. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Characterizing the Regulated Community </ITAG>In order to estimate the direct compliance costs imposed on the regulatedcommunity by today's interim final rule, EPA first divided the regulatedcommunity into three groups: medical waste generators, transporters includingtransfer facilities, and treatment and disposal facilities. EPA subdividedthe major generators of medical wastes potentially subject to regulationinto 11 categories (ten categories of specific generator types and one``other generators'' category) that are listed in Table 1. EPA obtainedmost of the data on the numbers in each generator category in each of theten demonstration States from the Department of Health and Human Servicesand professional associations (e.g., the American Medical Association,the American Dental Association, etc.). Other medical waste generator groups,besides those included in this analysis, may likely exist; EPA requestscomment and input on these additional generator categories. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Generator Categories and Characteristics</T4><H1>Generator</H1><H1>Number \1\</H1><H1>Waste generated per week per gen.

The Agency used thetotal number of universities in each of the ten States as an estimate ofthe total number of ``infirmaries''. The Agency used the per capita numberof freestanding blood banks in New Jersey to extrapolate an estimate oftheir numbers in the remaining nine states. To calculate the ``other generators''category, the Agency used the per capita number of health maintenance organizations(HMOs) and home health agencies in New Jersey to estimate their numbersin the remaining nine States. The Agency has significant detailed informationrelative to the State of New Jersey's health care industry and thus hasused this available data to estimate, through extrapolation, that informationfor other less well-characterized states. This analysis assumes that theper capita facility numbers of New Jersey are generally representativeof the other nine States. The Agency is continuing to collect more detailedinformation to further refine these estimates.The Agency had limited information concerning the number of transportersand treatment and disposal facilities that handle medical waste. For thepurposes of this analysis, the number of treaters and disposers has noimpact on costs, since their costs are a function of the number of shipments,not the number of disposers. Data on the number of transporters will affectcost estimates, because the total transporter reporting requirement costsare dependent on the number of transporters that must submit such reports.Information on transporter numbers is complicated by the fact that medicalwaste transporters often operate in multiple states and some states haveno licensing requirements for transporters. In the absence of detailedinformation, EPA estimates the total number of transporters in the tenstates to be 1,000, based on experience with current solid and hazardouswaste transportation and disposal practices. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Medical Waste Generation Rates </ITAG>Based on EPA analyses and interviews of medical waste generators and transporters,EPA estimated the average quantity of medical waste generated by an averagefacility within each of the generator categories. The Agency recognizesthat the size of the facility and the waste generation rates vary significantlywithin generator categories, particularly for hospitals. In estimatingwaste generation rates for hospitals and physician offices, EPA used dataavailable on per bed and per patient waste generation rates, coupled withdata on numbers of beds and numbers of patient visits, to determine wastegeneration estimates for these two generator categories. In determiningthe amount of medical waste generated by medical laboratories, the secondlargest per facility generator of medical waste by EPA estimates, EPA reliedon a New York Department of Health (NYDH) study of 156 clinical laboratorieswhich found that, on average, these facilities generate 51.7 pounds perday of ``infectious'' waste. EPA assumed the universe of waste for theNYDH study was equivalent to that regulated under today's rule. EPA usedthe NYDH survey result to estimate that medical laboratories generate 250pounds per week (50 pounds/day x 5 days/week) of medical wastes. EPA also estimated the total number of shipments for each generator categorybased on available waste generation rates and from interviews with bothgenerators and transporters. Based on this information, EPA estimated thathospitals ship out waste 3 times per week, blood banks and medical laboratoriesonce a week, and the remaining generator categories either once every otherweek or once a month. Table l provides a summary of the Agency's assumptionsmade in calculating waste generation and waste shipment rates. The Agencyrequests additional data on waste generation and shipment rates for all11 generator categories. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Existing Management Practices </ITAG>There are a number of current waste management practices that have beenadopted voluntarily by medical waste generators that are substantivelysimilar to the requirements set forth in today's interim final rule. Inthis cost analysis, EPA accounted for these baseline practices by reducingor eliminating either the incremental materials cost or the required tasktime associated with each component of the rule. For example, because theAgency assumes that sharps and fluids are already being segregated, EPAapplied no additional compliance costs (for either materials or labor time)for this requirement of the rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Tracking System Requirements </ITAG>EPA estimated the labor time required to process the tracking requirementsof today's rule. A similar analysis of labor time had been performed forthe Hazardous Waste Manifest's Information Collection Request document.EPA recognizes that some generators, transporters, and disposers alreadyuse manifests, shipping papers or other tracking mechanisms to documentthe movement of medical waste; however, this cost analysis does not attemptto adjust for these instances. To the extent that medical wastes are currentlymanifested in accordance with today's rule, compliance costs utilized inthis analysis will tend to be overstated. Each shipment of regulated medical waste requires use of a tracking form;therefore, the total number of shipments per generator per year determinesthe number of tracking forms that get processed. To estimate the costsof tracking, several different labor components are included to reflectthe steps necessary to process waste through the tracking system. EPA estimatesthat completing and handling the tracking form takes 15 minutes for thegenerator and 5 minutes each for the transporter and disposer; recordkeepingtakes 5 minutes for the generator; exception/discrepancy reporting takes2 hours for the generator and one-half hour for the disposer; and transporterreports require 80 hours of labor time. To the estimated labor time, EPAapplied a fully loaded (benefits and overhead) salary rate of $47,000 toderive total labor costs. In addition to these components of tracking,EPA included estimates of the cost savings derived from the consolidationor remanifesting of multiple small shipments as allowed under today's rule.EPA realizes that consolidation or remanifesting of medical wastes is notcommonly practiced and, therefore, estimated that only 10 percent of themedical waste shipments will be remanifested. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Generators of Less Than 50 Pounds </ITAG>Today's interim final rule exempts generators of less than 50 pounds permonth of medical waste from the tracking requirements. However, these generatorsare required to maintain log books for their waste shipments. For the generatorsof less than 50 pounds of medical waste per month, EPA estimated the incrementaltime required, per shipment, to complete the log book to be 5 minutes,which is one quarter of the per shipment time that EPA estimated it wouldtake for all other medical waste generators to complete the tracking formand recordkeeping requirements. Within each generator category, EPA estimatedthe percentage of generators that would qualify for this exemption, andassigned either 0 percent, 10 percent, or 50 percent of each generatorcategory to the subcategory of generators of less than 50 pounds. The Agencybased its estimates of the proportion of generators of less than 50 poundson the limited data available, assuming that 50 percent of the dentists,nursing homes, funeral homes, and hospices would qualify for the exemption.The Agency assumed that no hospitals, medical laboratories, or blood bankswould qualify for the exemption. All other generator categories were assumedto have 10 percent of their facilities qualify as generators of less than50 pounds per month. EPA believes these estimates are conservative, particularlyfor veterinarians, nursing homes, hospices, and funeral homes whose generated``medical waste'' will consist principally of sharps.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Incinerator Reporting </ITAG>Waste incinerated on-site is not subject to the labeling, packaging, andtracking requirements of today's rule, but is subject to recordkeepingand periodic reporting requirements. EPA estimated that these requirementsentail approximately 57 labor hours per facility per year. These reportingrequirements impose much lower costs than if the incinerated waste is shippedoff-site as medical waste. For the purposes of this analysis, EPA assumed that only hospitals useon-site incineration, although a small portion of the other generator categoriesalso utilize on-site incineration. An American Hospital Association survey(1983) estimates that 67 percent of United States hospitals use on-siteincineration. Based on this estimate, EPA assumed that 67 percent of thehospitals, as characterized in this analysis, incinerate their waste. EPAbelieves using this estimate in its analysis is conservative, since the67 percent of hospitals that have on-site incineration will tend to belarger facilities that generate a greater proportion of the total hospitalwaste and, therefore, more than 67 percent of total hospital waste is probablyincinerated. Furthermore, hospital incineration use has likely increasedsince 1983. Therefore, since incineration of waste imposes lower coststo the generator than shipping the waste off-site, EPA's compliance costestimate for hospitals tends to overstate the total cost to hospitals oftracking their waste. <ITAG tagnum="81">9. Packaging </ITAG>EPA recognizes that some form of packaging of medical waste is currentlytaking place, but the degree of labeling and packaging of medical wastevaries widely. For the purposes of this analysis, EPA assumed that ``leak-resistant''packaging requirements and the labeling requirements are voluntarily beingmet, but that the ``rigid'' packaging requirement is not. For the purposeof this analysis, EPA assumed that the rigid container performance standardwould be met by a four cubic foot cardboard box with a cost of $0.80 perbox. EPA recognizes that some medical waste is currently being packagedin rigid containers that would meet today's requirements. To the extentthat these practices are currently being used, compliance costs will tendto be overstated. Similarly, to the extent that the performance standardcan be met with alternative containers (either more or less expensive),compliance costs will vary from those estimated. In addition to the materialscost, EPA also has calculated the labor time for the generator to packand seal each box of waste to be five minutes. The total number of boxesthat are packed and labeled for each generator category is determined bydividing the weight of the generator's waste (that is to be shipped off-site)by the average weight capacity (assumed at 20 pounds per box) of a four(4) cubic foot cardboard box. For instance, EPA estimates that the averagemedical laboratory will generate 13,000 pounds or 650 boxes of medicalwaste per year (13,000/20=650). <ITAG tagnum="81">10. Existing and Proposed Medical Waste Regulations </ITAG>In establishing baseline waste management practices, EPA accounted forexisting State regulations. EPA adjusted the cost estimates to reflectState requirements that, for the purposes of this cost analysis, were determinedto be similar to today's rule. Where a current State requirement is determinedto be similar to today's rule, EPA assigned no incremental cost in thatState for that particular requirement. For purposes of this analysis, EPAassumed that none of the ten demonstration States have current requirementsthat are similar to all of the provisions in today's rule and thus allStates will have facilities that incur compliance costs. Moreover, halfof all affected States (Connecticut, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin)were assumed to have no existing requirements similar to the provisionsthat were analyzed in this cost analysis. In addition, EPA has estimatedthat Pennsylvania and Minnesota have similar provisions only for the packagingrequirement; New York and New Jersey have similar provisions for all butthe incinerator, generator of less than 50 pounds per month, and the transporternotification requirements; and Illinois has been estimated to have similartracking requirements solely for hospitals. <ITAG tagnum="81">11. Results </ITAG>During the two year demonstration period, today's rule will impose averageannual compliance costs of approximately $55.5 million, for a total estimated2 year program cost of $111 million (undiscounted). Thus the annual costsof today's rule, according to EPA estimates, are well below the ``major''rule threshold of $100 million.

EPA estimates that all generators combinedbear approximately half (55 percent) of the total costs of today's rule,with the remaining costs divided between transporters and disposers.EPA estimates that the overall average compliance costs of today's ruleon a per generator facility basis range from $3,757 per year for hospitalsto $71 per year for dentists. EPA estimates that the average incrementalcost per pound of generated medical waste for these same two generatorcategories is $0.04 for hospitals and $0.17 for dentists. The lower perpound cost for hospitals is due to the fact that hospitals frequently incineratetheir waste; also, hospitals dispose of more waste per shipment, and thereforetheir per-pound tracking costs are lower than dentists. EPA estimates theaverage incremental cost to generators in all the generator categoriesis $0.08 per pound of medical waste.EPA estimates that the highest per facility compliance cost is for hospitalsthat do not incinerate their waste and that do not currently meet the requirementsof today's rule. EPA estimated the highest cost for a ``typical'' hospital(one that generates an average of one ton of medical waste per week) tobe $15,638 per year. In contrast, a facility that generates more than 50pounds of medical waste per month and already meets the requirements oftoday's rule will have no additional compliance costs.EPA estimates the packaging requirements will impose costs of approximately$16 million per year. The amount of waste generated per year for all generatorsin a category is the driving force behind the costs for this component;thus physicians' offices and hospitals together account for two-thirdsof the total packaging costs. The remaining nine generator categories incurestimated aggregate annual packaging costs that range from $12,000 forinfirmaries to $1.4 million for dentists.EPA estimates that the costs of compliance with the tracking requirements($36.8 million per year) account for approximately two-thirds of the totalcompliance costs. EPA estimates that the generators will incur approximately$12 million of these tracking costs. Physician offices will account for$6.6 million of this estimate, dentists will account for $1.7 million,and the remaining nine generator categories account for less than $1 millioneach. The additional tracking costs are distributed between transportersand disposal facilities. EPA estimates that transporters will incur averageannual tracking system costs of approximately $14 million and disposersapproximately $11 million. The transporters also must notify the Agencyof their intent to transport medical waste; EPA estimates this onetimecost will total approximately $8,000.EPA estimates that incinerator recordkeeping and reporting requirementswill total approximately $1.7 million for the estimated 1,266 hospitalsin the demonstration States that currently use on-site incinerators. Generators of less than 50 pounds per month of medical waste, althoughexempt from the tracking requirements, are required to maintain a log oftheir generated wastes. This requirement will impose relatively small costson these generators ($1.1 million per year in aggregate). For example,the estimated 5,400 physician offices that EPA estimated are generatorsof less than 50 pounds of medical waste per month will have recordkeepingcosts of approximately $264,000 (or $49 per office) per year. <ITAG tagnum="81">12. Sensitivity Analysis </ITAG>These estimates may understate actual costs. For example, transport vehicleand disposal costs are assumed to be unchanged. For various reasons, landfillsare apparently less willing (and in some cases unwilling) to accept infectiouswaste, a phenomenon which suggests that the rule will increase disposalcosts two additional ways. First, landfills willing to accept regulatedmedical waste will be able to charge more for the service. Second, theincreased cost of land disposal will stimulate the demand for incineration.Limited information available to EPA suggest that the current price formedical waste incineration is about $0.30 per pound. Based on Table 1,EPA estimates about 230 million pounds of medical waste (that is not currentlyincinerated on site) are generated per year in the 10 States expected toparticipate. Assuming constant returns to scale in incineration, every1 percent of this waste shift from land disposal to off-site incinerationwill increase total costs by less than $1 million per year. Thus, if just10 percent of the medical waste tallied in Table 2 is shifted to off-siteincineration, the annual cost of the rule will be about 12 percent higherthan estimated. Savings from avoiding landfill disposal fees, increasedon-site management, and alternative treatment technologies, will offsetthis amount, while limited incineration capacity combined with increaseddemand will tend to increase it. In addition, EPA has not estimated the effects of the transporter vehiclecomponents of today's rule that requires all regulated medical waste betransported in a leak resistant, fully enclosed, non-compactor, cargo-carryingbody that is maintained in good operational and sanitary condition. However,today's rule does not prohibit the transport of regulated mcdical wastesimultaneously with other waste. The Agency does not have data to rigorouslyanalyze how these transporter vehicle requirements will affect currentpractices and costs. However, limited information supplied by transportersand generators indicates that in many instances medical wastes are alreadytransported in vehicles meeting the requirements of today's rule. To theextent that current practices do not reflect these requirements, transportercosts will be incurred. The Agency solicits comments on existing transportpractices and the effects of today's rule (including transport costs).In short, the cost figures provided here are meant to be rough estimatesof the actual costs of implementing the management standards and trackingrequirements promulgated today. As part of the program evaluation thatwill be conducted pursuant to section 11008 and discussed earlier in thisPreamble, EPA will update these cost estimates as new data is obtained.The Agency encourages generators, transporters, and disposers to submitcost information that they consider relevant to assessing the actual costsof the demonstration program. <ITAG tagnum="81">13. Benefits </ITAG>EPA has identified several benefits of today's rule that are discussedbelow. Although the Agency has not quantified all of these benefits, theymay be significant. For instance, medical and solid waste is often released into the environmentdue to improper waste handling practices. Today's rule, which includestracking requirements and transporter vehicle requirements (i.e., leak-resistant,fully enclosed, non-compacting vehicles) will likely induce waste transportersto haul medical waste separately from general refuse, most likely in separatetrucks. These requirements will ensure that greater care is taken whentransporting medical wastes so that it is not mishandled during transportand released into the environment. EPA has not quantified benefits to waste handlers and the general publicfron the packaging and labeling requirements contained in today's rule.Waste handlers will be able to recognize contained medical waste so theycan manage it safely; furthermore, medical waste will be more safely packagedthan general refuse so that handlers will be less likely to be exposedto its hazards. Likewise, if the general public inadvertently comes intocontact with packaged medical waste, they will be able to distinguish itfrom other solid waste. Today's rule will increase awareness of the potential hazards and adverseenvironmental and aesthetic consequences of improper management of medicalwaste. As a result of this heightened awareness, EPA believes that theproper handling of wastes in the health care industry will extend beyondthe scope of today's rule. In addition, EPA believes that the tracking system may increase the incentivesfor on-site treatment of medical waste. SpecificaIly, generators may incinerateor treat and destroy their wastes in order to exempt these wastes fromtoday's requirements. As a result, there will be less untreated medicalwaste transported off-site, thereby reducing the chance that it will beaesthetically or biologically harmful. Finally, there are inadequate data on medical waste generation rates, treatmentpractices, fate and transport characteristics, and disposal practices currentlyavailable. Implementing the medical waste tracking system will enable EPAto collect the detailed information needed for the Reports to Congressthat the Agency is required to complete (see Section 11008 of RCRA). Infact, information gathering is one of the principal purposes of the Act.By collecting this information, the Agency will be better able to identifythe problems associated with the management of medical waste, quantifythe amounts and types of medical waste generated, and thereby improve thetechnical basis for evaluating the need for further regulation.In addition to the benefits discussed qualitatively above, EPA has quantifiedone additional potential social benefit of today's interim final rule.For the purposes of this particular benefits analysis, EPA assumed thetracking system to be effective in eliminating the problem of medical wastesappearing on the beaches of the demonstration States. The data sourceson which to base this analysis are sparse, and the Agency has estimatedbenefits based on limited data. The Agency further recognizes that thesources of beach wash-ups are not certain. Moreover, a recent study (NYDEC,1988) suggests that combined sewer overflows and transfer operations atmunicipal solid waste landfills located near water bodies contribute tothe problem. Also, household waste generators, a known source of medicalwaste found on beaches, are not subject to today's rule. Therefore, itis likely that today's tracking rule may not directly or significantlyaffect these potential sources for wash-ups. However, since reducing thewash-up of medical wastes caused by sources subject to today's rule isone of the goals of the tracking system, EPA has performed the benefitsanalysis to illustrate the potential gains from doing so. For purposes of assessing this potential benefit of the tracking system,the Agency developed two approaches. The two methodological approachesare simplistic, but do provide some quantitative estimation of the effectsof medical waste. The first approach is based on benefits that accrue specificallyto beach users (e.g., sunbathers, swimmers, strollers). It uses an estimateof the economic value of a beach-day visit and the number of lost beach-dayvisits a successful tracking system would prevent. The second approachis based on a broader range of benefits that accrue not only to beach users,but also to other groups such as those who value the option to visit thebeach and those among the general population who are not completely indifferentto the fact that medical waste is washing up on the nation's beaches. Inthe first approach, analyzed benefits are limited to Connecticut, New Jersey,and New York; in the second approach, benefits are accrued from all 10demonstration States. Both methodologies involve simple extrapolationsbased on rough approximations of the relevant parameters. They are thereforeextremely sensitive to the assumptions used and are, at best, accurateby perhaps an order of magnitude. The first method estimates the value of medical-waste related beach closingin Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey, at approximately $30 million.This figure is obtained by extrapolation based on very limited data concerningNew Jersey beach visitation. The second approach uses a different methodof extrapolation to obtain an estimate of $100 million for all 10 Statesexpected to participate in the demonstration program. In both cases, the management standards and tracking program establishedtoday are assumed to eliminate all beach closings due to medical waste.As indicated in the background section of this Preamble, however, the programis not expected to significantly reduce medical waste wash-ups.B. Regulatory Flexibility Act In sections 11002 and 11003 of RCRA, Congress set a six-month deadlinefor EPA to promulgate regulations listing the types of medical waste tobe tracked and establishing segregation, packaging, labeling, and trackingrequirements. Section 11010 gives EPA specific authority to promulgatetoday's regulations without prior opportunity for public comment. EPA hasdetermined that the time constraints established by the statute make itimpracticable to propose the regulations and accept public comments beforepromulgation of the rule. Because the Agency is not required to publish a proposal for public commentin connection with today's rule, this rulemaking is not subject to theRegulatory Flexibility Act (see 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Accordingly, noRegulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared for this rule, althoughfuture rulemakings under RCRA Subtitle J may require such an analysis.Also, section 11008(a)(3)(B) requires EPA to report to the Congress onthe costs to businesses to comply with the tracking program. To the extentpractical, EPA plans to assess, in particular, costs to small businessesaffected by the rules in the reports required by section 11008. C. Paperwork Reduction Act Section 11010 of RCRA states that the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980,44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq., </T3>does not apply to regulations required to be promulgatedwithin nine months of Subtitle J's enactment. Thus, the recordkeeping andreporting requirements contained in today's rule are not subject to approvalby the Office of Management and Budget. However, EPA has adhered to a policyof minimizing the reporting requirements in today's rule to the extentpossible consistent with statutory requirements. For instance, where EPAis requiring information to help develop the section 11008 reports to Congress(i.e., the transporter periodic reports and the expanded incinerator report),EPA is requiring these reports from transporters because that is the mostefficient way to obtain the information Congress requires. EPA also hasdeveloped special exemptions for generators of less than 50 pounds permonth under which they need not initiate tracking forms for each shipment;instead they must maintain a log (see Part 259, Subpart F, and SectionV of today's Preamble). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>40 CFR Part 22 Administrative practice and procedure, Penalties. 40 CFR Part 259 Medical waste, Labeling, Packaging and containers, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Tracking, Incinerators.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 13, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.
