The through currents have thecharacteristic that the quasistationary IVC of the MIS structures atroom temperature become straight lines in double logarithmic coordinates.The curves had two characteristic sections: linear increase of the currentwith the voltage (ohmic section) and a more rapid increase in the current.The polarity did not significantly affect the magnitude of the current.Heating the MIS structure up to 400{sup 0}K in a dry-nitrogen atmosphereafter relaxation did not increase the current. The authors conclude that,at temperatures greater than 200{sup 0}K, the conductivity of films oflow-temperature pyrolytic silicon dioxide can be explained in terms ofthe drift of charged ions in an electric field. When the intensity ofthe electric field increased, the density of mobile protons increasedseveralfold. The activation energy of the proton migration process equals0.63-0.65 eV.</TEXT></DOC>
