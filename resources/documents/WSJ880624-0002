NRC spokesman Jan Strasma said the proposed fine involved Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton and was assessed because the service willfully failed to report the September 1986 spill within 24 hours and because one man inhaled some of the powder. No one was injured.    The &quot;failure to report&quot; violation accounted for $100,000 of the proposed fine, he said. Mr. Strasma said it is the first time the NRC has proposed a fine against a military organization.    The radioactive americium-241 leaked out of an unlabeled barrel while four workers were taking inventory in a storage building. The powder is not considered dangerous on the skin, but can cause cancer if swallowed or inhaled, experts say.    &quot;There was an effort to avoid reporting it to anyone, including other groups within the Air Force,&quot; Mr. Strasma said.    Revelations of the spill a year later touched off allegations of a cover-up by Air Force officials and prompted Sens. John Glenn (D., Ohio) and Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) to hold a Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearing at the base.    Mr. Strasma said the fine is proposed against the Air Force Radioisotope Committee. He said the Air Force has 30 days to pay the fine or protest it. A protest would be evaluated by NRC staff, which could then modify the proposed fine.    At that point, the Air Force could request a hearing before an NRC administrative law judge or the agency's Atomic Safety Licensing Board, either of which is empowered to make the final determination, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
