The rates, a response to similar discounts offered recently by American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., apply only to so-called T-1 service, under which MCI provides phone lines in packages of 24. An MCI spokesman said T-1 amounts to &quot;a very small part&quot; of MCI's business, but he declined to elaborate.    Wall Street analysts praised the MCI discount plan as part of the company's campaign to grab more large business customers. But the analysts said the price cuts won't attract enough new customers to improve revenue significantly in the short term.    &quot;It's a good idea, but it isn't going to make a big splash,&quot; said Lap Lee, an analyst with Salomon Brothers.    MCI said its discount will offer customers as much as a 35% saving from ATandamp;T's similar volume pricing plan. But Mr. Lee estimated that most MCI customers would save only &quot;in the high single digits&quot; compared with ATandamp;T. </TEXT></DOC>
