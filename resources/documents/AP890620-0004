Most wore the red, blue and green colors of SWAPO, the South-WestAfrica People's Organization, which fought for 23 years to winNamibia's independence from South Africa. In the rush to welcome thenew arrivals, few noticed a South African army truck convoy passingat that moment, its drivers grim-faced as they threaded their waytoward home.   The scene last week symbolizes the changes taking place inOvamboland, Namibia's populous northern tier, as the territory triesto put a 23-year bush war behind it and move toward peace andindependence.   The situation, say local residents and frequent visitors, haschanged swiftly and dramatically since South Africa agreed inDecember to a plan under which it will give up Africa's last colony,which it has held for 74 years. The deal also provides forU.N.-supervised elections to set up a new government.   Despite a flare-up of border fighting that stalled the plan inApril, the South African military presence, which once numbered50,000 troops, has been steadily cut to about 15,000, with moreleaving daily.   At the main military base in Oshakati, once known as ``WhiteCity,'' scores of houses now stand empty, and the only South Africansoldiers in evidence at the base are paratroopers manning the gate.U.N. officers occupy the former headquarters buildings.   By road and rail, scores of armored vehicles used in theguerrilla war are being sent back to South Africa. Others, stillcaked with mud from jungle patrols, line base parking lots.   Among those requisitioned by U.N. officials for use by their ownforces are at least 10 Casspirs vehicles. In the hands of the hatedKoevet (Crowbar) anti-insurgency police, the hulking vehicles cameto symbolize the harsh South African law enforcement polices.   Repainted white with big ``U.N.'' letters on the side, theCasspirs will be used by the U.N. police monitors, whose job is towatch and handle complaints about the conduct of the South-WestAfrican Police, of which Koevoet is now a part.   The most stunning change, say some residents and visitors, is thesudden and omnipresent visibility of SWAPO after years of governmentsuppression.   The nationalist movement, considered likely to win a majority inthe elections scheduled for November, draws its largest support inthis region of bushland, farms and scattered settlements, home tonearly half of Namibia's 1.4 million people.   Although the internal political wing of SWAPO could legallyoperate while the guerrilla unit was outlawed, this popular supportremained largely hidden in the years of warfare. Even displaying theSWAPO flag often brought harassment and brutal South Africantreatment.   Now the flag flutters openly from homes, roadside liquor storesand garages, even atop a concrete water tower near the Angolanborder where, until a few weeks ago, South African soldiers mannedmachine guns.   The exiles, said by the United Nations to number 41,000, arereturning to Namibia aboard U.N.-chartered flights from neighboringcountries to register for the November vote, the first step towardsetting up an independent government.   Some observers say they have been surprised by the speed of theSouth African withdrawal and by the lack of visible bitterness onthe part of the departing forces.   However, a barely concealed resentment remains among many whiteresidents of northern Namibia about what is taking place _especially the demonstrations in support of SWAPO, which manybelieve is determined to impose a Marxist regime if it wins thetwo-thirds majority needed to control the new government in theNovember elections.   ``Are you going to write the truth about this (mess-up)?'' oneGerman-speaking resident asked a journalist at the base guest house.   Reports persist in the community that the Koevoet, althoughofficially integrated into the regular police, still holds severalSWAPO guerrillas as prisoners and continues to intimidate andbrutalize SWAPO supporters in the countryside.   Peter Fitzgerald, a Dublin police superintendent who commands theU.N. police monitoring contingent, said he had been unable to pindown ``rumors'' about prisoners.</TEXT></DOC>
