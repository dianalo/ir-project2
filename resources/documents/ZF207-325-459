 For U.S.andO;Treasury bonds, however, the yield calculation involves a daunting formula.andO;Because of the complex math, many institutional investors shy away from using1-2-3 or Symphony to calculate accurate treasury-bond yields.andP;  Instead theyuse a calculator or settle for a spreadsheet approximation of yield.andP;  But forfinancial institutions and corporate finance departments, the last few basispoints (hundredths of a percentage point of yield) can make or break aninvestment decision.andP;  Therefore, accuracy is important.andM;For a bond investor the template described here can:andM;* calculate treasury-bond yield accurately to three decimal placesandM;* determine the intra-day yield values useful in making buying decisionsandM;* determine total bond portfolio value at any point in timeandM;* calculate bond portfolio average weighted yieldandM;More than 200 U.S.andP;  Treasury bonds with a total valuation of approximatelytwo trillion dollars are currently available for purchase on the open market.andO;Each pays a stated coupon rate in two installments per year until itsmaturity date.andP;  For example, each $100,000-face-value, 7 1/2% coupon treasurybond due to mature in November 2016 pays $3,750 (half the year's coupon rateof $7,500) on May 15 and November 15 each year until November 15, 2016.andP;  Atmaturity the bond pays the final coupon payment plus principal, or a total of$103,750.andP;  The price of this bond in the open market varies each day.andP;  Youmake money by buying and selling these bonds in accordance with pricefluctuations, in addition to receiving income from coupon payments.andM;ABOUT THE MODELandM;This template can be used in any version of 1-2-3 or Symphony.andP;  It requiresthree pieces of information: coupon rate, maturity date, and asking price.andO;In response, it calculates settlement date (the day the transaction will becompleted) and yield to maturity.andP;  The model relies on formulas using datefunctions to calculate coupon periods.andP;  It also incorporates formulas thedepend on the @NOW function (in 1-2-3 Release 1A, @TODAY) to return anaccurate date.andM;Sophisticated mathematics in the template uses a yield estimate to calculatea test price.andP;  Thistest price is then compared with the actual price entered.andO;If the prices do not match, the model knows that the estimate of yield usedto calculate the test price was incorrect.andP;  It supplies another yieldestimate and calculates the test price again.andP;  Another comparison betweentest and actual price is made, and if these prices do not match, stillanother yield estimate is made.andP;  A total of five calculation steps areperformed, though most yields are determined in three calculation cycles.andM;The degree of yield-estimate adjustment is governed by the disparity betweentest and actual price values.andP;  The larger the disparity, the larger theadjustment.andP;  The template is designed to use five sets of price calculationsto generate five test prices.andP;  Test prices are compared to the actual bondprice you enter.andM;You can make multiple copies of the template we'll be using here to embed ina larger template.andP;  All the calculations occur in a single row.andP;  You can copythe entire row down the worksheet and analyze or average the yields ofseveral treasury bonds in a portfolio.andP;  The box on the facing page providesinstructions for building the template.andM;The template has several functional areas.andP;  Range A5..C7 (see figure 1) isthe input area.andP;  Because of bond-trading conventions, the bond price in cellC7 is entered in percents of a dollar, with any fractional portions expressedin 32nds.andP;  Thus, a price of 84.21 means $84 21/32 per $100 face value.andP;  Themodel automatically converts thirty-seconds to decimal equivalents.andP;  Theyield to maturity is returned in cell D7.andP;  A given bond's maturity date isentered in an @DATE function in cell B7.andP;  To enter the maturity date for adifferent bond, you edit the year, month, and day arguments of this function.andM;Range F7..I7 contains date functions used to calculate the previous and nextcoupon dates.andP;  These dates are important because they affect the value ofaccrued interest.andP;  Cells J7 and K7 return the previous and next coupon dates.andO;In cell L7 (see figures 2), the value 181 appears.andP;  This value represents thenumber of days in the current coupon period.andP;  Usually this value representssix months--approximately 180 days.andP;  In cell M7, the fraction of the currentcoupon period thus far elapsed (1-Tsc/B) is calculated.andP;  Cell N7 divides thecoupon rate in cell A7 by 100 so that it can be used in other calculations.andM;Accrued interest is calculated in cell O7 (more information on this in aminute).andP;  Cell P7 returns the number of coupon payments remaining until thebond's maturity.andP;  In cell Q7, bond price is converted from percent andthirty-seconds of a percent to dollars and cents.andP;  Cell R7 calculates thenumber of years remaining until maturity, a value used in calculating theinitial yield estimate.andM;Range S7..V7 is where the iterative calculation routine begins (see figure3).andP;  YLD0 is the initial estimate of yield calculated by the model.andP;  PRI0 isthe price consistent with that estimate of yield.andP;  YLD0' is the initial yieldestimate plus 1 basis point (0.01% of yield).andP;  PRI0' is the price consistentwith that yield.andP;  The formula in cell W7 returns a refined estimate of yield.andO;The range containing YLD1 entries (W7..Z7) calculates the first improvedestimate of yield.andP;  The cells containing YLD2 entries (these and thefollowing cells are not shown in the figures) calculate the second improvedestimate of yield.andP;  The YLD3 and YLD4 cell groups further refine the yieldestimate.andP;  YLD5 is the fully refined estimate of yield.andM;CALCULATING ACCRUED INTERESTandM;The bond buyer pays the bond seller on settlement day, usually the nextbusiness day.andP;  Cell C3 calculates settlement day, assuming the transactionoccurs on the date returned by @NOW.andP;  The settlement date is one day laterunless @NOW returns a Friday, in which case it's three days later.andP;  Sinceinterest accrues each day from the date of the previous coupon payment to thedate of the next coupon payment, the model calculates these two dates inrange J7..K7.andM;The previous and next coupon dates can be any of four dates: the two coupondates in the current coupon year, the last coupon date in the previous couponyear, or the first coupon date in the next coupon year.andP;  The model calculatesall four dates (F7..I7).andP;  It then tests to see which of these dates has adate number closest to but less than the date number of @NOW.andP;  This is theprevious coupon date.andP;  It also tests to see which of the four dates has adate number closest to but larger than @NOW.andP;  This is the next coupon date.andM;Cell F7 contains an @DATE(year, month, day) function.andP;  Year is one less thanthe year of settlement (based on the date number in cell C3); month is themonth in which coupon payments are made; day is the day of the month on whichcoupon payments are made.andP;  Date2, Date3, and Date4 are calculated once Date1is determined.andP;  Cell J7 uses a nested @IF statement to determine which amongDate1, Date2, and Date3 was the previous coupon payment.andP;  For example, ifneither Date3 nor Date2 is earlier than the date number in cell C3, theprevious coupon date is Date1.andM;CALCULATING YIELD TO MATURITYandM;The yield of a bond depends on the time remaining until principal is repaid.andO;So the model incorporates more calculations involving time.andP;  The number ofremaining coupon payments in cell P7 depends on both the difference betweenthe year of maturity and the year of the next coupon and the differencebetween the month of maturity and the month of the next coupon.andM;The formula in cell T7, the heart of the model, calculates a bond priceconsistent with the yield appearing in cell S7 It uses relative, absolute,and mixed addresses, which allow it to be copied to other columns and rows.andO;The range $SETT is an absolute cell address because the date number in cellC3 is addressed absolutely.andP;  All other addresses use a mix of absolute andrelative notation, so the cells that contain coupon rate, number of couponpayments, and so on, are the same in copies that appear on the same row.andM;The model determines the impact on price of a .01% change in yield.andP;  Thesecalculations are performed in cells U7 and V7.andP;  Cell W7 calculates therevised estimate of yield.andP;  The adjustment to the previous estimate variesdirectly with the difference between the calculated price and the quotedprice and varies inversely with the impact of a one basis point change inyield.andM;USING THE TEMPLATEandM;Once you've built the model, it's easy to use.andP;  To verify that it workscorrectly, enter a coupon rate in cell A7, a maturity date in cell B7, and anasking price in cell C7.andP;  If you enter a date for the years 2000-2099, add100 to the year number of the @DATE function.andP;  Use bond data from The WallStreet Journal or another reliable source.andM;The yield returned by the template should match the yield value supplied inthe Journal.andP;  If it does not, check to be sure that all formulas are enteredcorrectly.andP;  If the formulas are correct and the results still don't match, besure that the maturity day of the month you are using is correct.andP;  Some bondsmature on days other than the 15th of the month.andP;  For these bonds, you mustedit the formula in cell B7 to return the correct day of maturity.andM;One final note: Because of the way the date calculations for coupon dates aremade, some maturity dates entered in cell B7 cause date formulas to returnERR.andP;  The problem occurs when maturity dates fall at the end of months thatare six months prior to months with fewer than 31 days.andP;  This template cannotbe used for bonds with the following maturity dates: March 31, May 31, August31, October 31, and December 31.andM;If you are able to devise a solution to this date problem, please write toLOTUS and share your technique with other readers.andP;  All of us in thebond-trading business will appreciate it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
