Officers and directors at Microsoft Corp. headed the listwith some multimillion-dollar stock sales, filings with theSecurities and Exchange Commission show. But insiders at MipsComputer Systems Inc., Quantum Corp. and Apple Computer Inc.were also among the sellers in February, according to thefilings.</LP><TEXT>   The sales took place before many technology stocks reached52-week highs in early March, fueled by a broad market rally,generally good fourth-quarter earnings and productintroductions.   &quot;I felt kind of bad,&quot; said David Marquardt, a Microsoftdirector who sold 30,000 shares for $103 to $103.25 each inmid-February. &quot;A day or two after I sold, the stock went to$111.&quot;   Still, recent sales were at prices nearly double what thestocks fetched last fall. Even companies that reporteddisappointing earnings for the December quarter saw stockprices rise.   &quot;Since October, technology has been on an incrediblerocket ship,&quot; said Shigeki Makino, an analyst at FidelityInvestments in Boston. &quot;It's not surprising that {insiders}would consider it prudent to take their profits.&quot;   Many technology stocks have fallen off in the past coupleof weeks amid concern about earnings in the current quarter,profit-taking and a slowdown in the general market. The stockof International Business Machines Corp. plunged $12.75 ashare to $115.125 in New York Stock Exchange compositetrading yesterday after the computer giant told securitiesanalysts its first-quarter earnings will probably be abouthalf what they were predicting.   Other technology stocks also took a dive after the IBMannouncement but later recovered most or all their losses.Microsoft, for instance, closed at $99, down 25 cents ashare, in national over-the-counter trading, after falling aslow as $96.75 yesterday morning.   The big Microsoft sales were by William H. Gates III,chairman, and Paul G. Allen, the company's co-founder and adirector, although those sales just made a dent in the twoinsiders' total holdings.   Mr. Gates made his third 350,000-share sale since October,the filings show. The block sold most recently, on Feb. 11,fetched $36.1 million but represented only 1% of hisMicrosoft holdings. He retains a stake of almost 40 millionshares in the Redmond, Wash., software company, valued atnearly $4 billion at current market prices.   Mr. Allen trimmed his holdings by 3%, SEC filings show,with a 500,000-share sale that fetched $51.4 million. Also inFebruary, filings show, Bernard Vergnes, vice president,Europe, sold 15,000 Microsoft shares, 36% of his holdings.Messrs. Gates, Allen and Vergnes declined to comment, as didthe company.   The shares Mr. Marquardt sold, for a total of $3.1million, accounted for 57% of his holdings, SEC filings show.He said he still holds &quot;substantial options&quot; and sells stockfrom time to time to diversify his portfolio. &quot;I'm still verybullish on the company,&quot; said Mr. Marquardt, a venturecapitalist who has owned Microsoft stock since 1981.   The insiders received prices ranging from $100.75 to $104a share, SEC filings show, slightly more than yesterday'sclosing price.   As reported earlier this week, Rod Canion, president andchief executive officer of Compaq Computer Corp., sold140,000 shares, or 82% of his holdings in the company, onFeb. 5 for $98 million. A Compaq spokesman said Mr. Canionsold for personal financial reasons. Several other Compaqinsiders also lightened their holdings in February, SECfilings show.   At Mips, a maker of computer chips in Sunnyvale, Calif.,11 insiders sold a total of 64,639 shares for about $1million in February; other insiders have filed theirintentions to sell shares.   The sales followed the firm's Feb. 5 announcement of afourth-quarter net loss, which came as a surprise to mostWall Street analysts. At the time, Mips also said it was&quot;very cautious&quot; about the outlook for the first half of 1991.Nonetheless, Mips stock has continued to climb, riding up ondetails of its new generation of chips and rumors that Compaqplans to adopt its technology.   &quot;Most of these people have sold only a small fraction oftheir holdings, for personal financial reasons,&quot; a companyspokeswoman said. She said the company's 775 employeespurchased 240,245 shares of company stock, at fair marketvalue, in 1990.   The largest insider seller was John Hennessy, chiefscientist, who sold 25,000 shares in several sales from Feb.8 through Feb. 25, one-sixth of his holdings, SEC filingsshow. He sold at share prices ranging from $14.25 to $15.88.   The next largest sale was by Stephen Bennion, vicepresident and treasurer. He sold 9,374 shares on Feb. 8 at$14.38 a share, and retains 104 shares, filings show. Mr.Hennessy and Mr. Bennion declined to comment.   Mips stock finished unchanged at $18.25 in nationalover-the-counter trading.   Four insiders at Quantum, a maker of disk drives inMilpitas, Calif., sold a total of 19,558 shares for $469,481,SEC filings show. The shares accounted for 89% of theirholdings of Quantum stock. Two other insiders sold stock inJanuary, although those were option-related transactions,according to the filings.   The biggest sale was 8,846 shares by Jeffrey Heimbuck,president of the Plus Development unit, leaving him with 189shares, the filings show. Mark Wilson, vice president of theportable storage products business, sold his entire stake of5,891 shares, according to the filings.   A Quantum spokeswoman said that the sales were &quot;personalfinancial decisions&quot; and had nothing to do with theexecutives' expectations for the company. She noted that thefour continue to hold a significant number of options and ifoptions are included, their sales account for less than 5% oftheir Quantum holdings.   Seven Quantum insiders sold stock in December.   In January, Quantum reported fiscal third-quarter earningsthat were a disappointment to many analysts. The stock pricefell more than $3 a share, to $18.125, the day after theearnings were reported.   Quantum closed yesterday at $23.375, down 75 cents, innational over-the-counter trading. The February sales were atprices between $23.75 and $24.88 a share.   At Apple Computer, Albert Eisenstat, executive vicepresident, who sold 129,000 shares in January for $7.1million, sold an additional 71,000 shares, for $4.2 million.The sales, which accounted for nearly 90% of his holdings atthe start of the year, leave him with 24,036 shares.   Mr. Eisenstat couldn't be reached for comment. An Applespokeswoman said the company's policy is to not comment onsuch sales.
