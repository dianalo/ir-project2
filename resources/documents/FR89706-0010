The Treaty governs Pacific Salmon stocks which originate inU.S. and Canadian waters and which are subject to interception by the otherparty and affect the management or biology of stocks of the other party.The Treaty governs most of the salmon stocks covered by the Fishery ManagementPlan for the Salmon Fisheries in the EEZ off the coast of Alaska (FMP);the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) must ensure thatthe FMP is consistent with the Treaty. The Treaty also requires Canadaand the United States to establish and enforce regulations to implementprovisions of the Treaty, particularly regarding transboundary river resources,specific fisheries for chinook and coho, and a general obligation to preventincreased interceptions.Section 7(a) of Pub. L. 99-5, the Pacific Salmon Treaty Act of 1985, 16U.S.C. 3631 <T3>et seq.</T3>, requires the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to issueconforming amendatory regulations applicable to the U.S. exclusive economiczone (EEZ) to carry out U.S. international obligations under the Treaty.This final rule amends the regulations at 50 CFR Part 674 to adopt fishingseasons and catch limitations for 1989 that, in conjunction with similarmeasures adopted by the State of Alaska (State) for its waters, will ensurethat the high-seas salmon fishery is conducted in a manner that fulfillsour international obligations under the Treaty.<ITAG tagnum="84">Quotas for Chinook Salmon</ITAG>Under the treaty, which established it, the Pacific Salmon Commission (Commission)set the 1989 chinook salmon quotas at its meeting in February 1989. Forall salmon fisheries in Southeast Alaska, the Commission set the harvestquota at 263,000 chinook salmon from the base stocks; this number equalslast year's harvest quota for the base stocks. The base stocks are thosewild and hatchery stocks that were being harvested in this fishery whenthe Treaty was signed.In addition, the Commission authorized Alaska to augment the harvest quotafor base stocks with a supplemental harvest of chinook salmon producedby Alaska hatcheries that are in excess of those included in the base stocks.The exact amount of this supplemental harvest will be calculated in seasonusing procedures approved by the Commission. The current preseason estimateof the supplemental harvest is 42,200 chinook; consequently, the totalallowable harvest is predicted to be about 305,200 chinook.<ITAG tagnum="84">Chinook Harvest Guidelines for the Troll Fishery</ITAG>Because the chinook harvest occurs principally within the State waters,the Council defers to the Alaska Board of Fisheries (Board) on allocationdecisions. The Board met in Juneau during March 1989. Although it actedon numerous proposals for the salmon fisheries, it retained the existingharvest guidelines for chinook among the various groups of fishermen inSoutheast Alaska. Therefore, of the 263,000 chinook harvest quota for basestocks, the harvest guidelines are as follows: Sport_22,000; net (seine,drift gillnet, set gillnet, and trap)_20,000; troll_221,000. The Boarddid not allocate the estimated supplemental harvest of 42,200 chinook,but each fishery will be allowed to catch as many of those supplementalchinook as it can until the Commission's harvest quota for base stocksis reached. The exact number of the supplemental chinook salmon that eachfishery harvests will be determined as the season progresses from the recoveryof coded-wire tags from the Alaska hatchery fish, and these tagged fishwill be excluded from the calculation used in determining when the harvestquota for base stocks is reached.As indicated above, the Board established the 1988-1989 harvest guidelinefor the chinook troll fishery at 221,000 fish. The winter fishery in Statewaters (October 1, 1988-April 14, 1989) harvested about 35,000 chinook.About 18 percent of this harvest (some 6,300 fish) were Alaskan hatcherychinook. The remainder of the fish harvested in the winter fishery (about28,700) were from the harvest quota for base stocks and have to be subtractedfrom the troll harvest guidelines of 221,000, leaving, in round numbers,about 192,000 chinook of the base stocks for the remainder of the 1989troll fishery.According to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the experimental Junetroll fishery in State waters is expected to harvest 25,000 chinook. Itis estimated that between 10,000 and 20,000 of the fish from this harvestwill be Alaska hatchery chinook. The remaining 5,000 to 15,000 chinookare expected to be harvested from the base stocks and have to be subtractedfrom the troll harvest guideline. Therefore, between 177,000 and 187,000chinook of the base stocks are expected to remain for the summer trollfishery (i.e., harvest guideline of 221,000 less winter fishery catch of28,700 less estimated June experimental fishery catch of 5,000 to 15,000leaves between 177,000 and 187,000 fish in round numbers). The remainingnumber of chinook left for the summer fishery applies to all commercialsalmon trolling in the marine waters of Southeast Alaska and the EEZ; thereis no separate allocation for the troll fishery in the EEZ.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Summer Troll Fishing Season</ITAG>The Board set July 1 as the opening date of the summer commercial trollfishing season for chinook and other species of salmon. The fishing periodfor chinook salmon will be closed when the chinook quota has been harvested.The summer commercial troll fishing season for species of salmon otherthan chinook closes at midnight September 20.The Board intended that the chinook troll fishery be managed so that thereis a single summer troll fishing period for chinook salmon. Fishing periodsare scheduled to avoid, as much as practicable, nonretainable incidentalcatches of chinook during fisheries for other species. Chinook that arecaught and released suffer a mortality of about 20 to 25 percent. Thatis, about one out of every four chinook caught by trollers and releasedwill die from wounds or being handled. Managers attempt to reduce the chancesof chinook being caught when they cannot be retained. Thus, after the trollshare of the chinook quota has been harvested, chinook retention in thetroll fishery will be prohibited while fishing for the other salmon species(coho, sockeye, pink, and chum). Also, in the past 6 years, the Secretaryand the State have prohibited trolling in several outer coastal areas inState waters and a small area in the EEZ where chinook are known to concentrate.These closures may be necessary again.Depending on the size of the coho run and the speed at which the coho movefrom the offshore waters into the inside waters and spawning grounds, theSecretary and the State may close the troll fishery to the harvest of allsalmon species for about 10 days between mid-July and mid-August in orderto protect coho.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fishing Periods</ITAG>Unless modified later, the fishing periods (Alaska Daylight Time) for thecommercial troll fishery in the EEZ off Southeast Alaska are as follows:<T3>Chinook salmon:</T3> From 0001 hours on July 1, 1989, until the chinookharvest guideline is reached (probably about July 20).<T3>All salmon species except chinook: </T3>From 0001 hours on 1 July 1989until 2400 hours on September 20, 1989. After the fishing season begins, the Secretary may issue notices to modifythese fishing periods on the basis of contingencies which include the following:(1) The troll fishery for all species of salmon may be closed for about10 days between mid-July and mid-August unless an evaluation of SoutheastAlaska coho salmon shows their abundance to be well above average and thatthey are making good progress in their inshore migrations. This possibleclosure is designed (a) to stabilize or reduce the proportion of coho harvestedin the offshore and coastal fisheries, (b) to allow adequate harvests bythe fisheries in the marine and fresh waters inshore of the surfline ofSoutheast Alaska as described in 5 Alaska Administrative Code 33.312(b),and (c) to allow adequate numbers of coho to escape the fisheries and reachthe spawning grounds. (2) The fishery for chinook salmon may be reopened for a short time afterit has been closed if (a) harvest statistics reveal that the fishery wasclosed before the chinook base quota, established by the Treaty, was reached,(b) estimated chinook remaining for the fishery and predicted harvest rateswill allow the fishery to be reopened for more than 12 hours without exceedingthe harvest quota for base stocks, and (c) the reopening of the chinookfishery in the EEZ is compatible with a reopening of the fishery in Alaskanwaters. (3) If management actions need to be taken to reduce the hooking mortalityof chinook salmon caught incidentally during the fishery for other salmonspecies, or to restrict the harvest of chinook to an incidental harvest,several outer coastal areas in State waters and a small area of the EEZknown to have high concentrations of chinook may be closed as they havebeen in recent past years. <ITAG tagnum="84">Other Matters </ITAG>A provision of the Pacific Salmon Treaty (Annex IV, Chapter 3) requireseach nation to submit the plans it has developed for managing its salmonfisheries to the other nation before the start of the fishing season. TheUnited States and Canada will have exchanged all their fishing plans beforethe start of the salmon fishing season. Copies of this notice have been provided to the North Pacific Fishery ManagementCouncil, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Coast Guard forreview and consultation as required by section 7(a) of the Pacific SalmonTreaty Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>Under section 7(a) of the Pacific Salmon Treaty Act, this acton is exemptfrom sections 4 through 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.553 to 557), the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act. It is exempt from Executive Order 12291 because it involvesa foreign affairs function. It contains no requirement for collecting informationfor purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The Director of the NMFS Alaska Region has determined that this rule willbe implemented in a manner that is consistent to the maximum extent practicablewith the approved coastal zone management program of the State of Alaska.This determination has been submitted for review by the responsible Stateagency under section 307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act. This finalrule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 674 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Fisheries, Fishing, and internationalorganizations. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 30, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
