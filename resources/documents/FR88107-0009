Introduction and Summary </ITAG>The stack height regulation revisions promulgated on July 8, 1985 (50 FR27892) implement the provisions of section 123 of the Clean Air Act, whichrequires that the degree of emission limitation required for control ofany air pollutant under an applicable state implementation plan (SIP) shallnot be affected by (1) stack heights in excess of good engineering practice(GEP), or (2) any other dispersion technique. For more detailed discussion,see the July 8, 1985 notice. Stationary sources of air pollution are subject to emission limitationsto assure attainment of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS)and to protect prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) increments.These limitations are derived from predictions of ground-level pollutantconcentrations that will occur in the area of maximum impact as a resultof pollutant emissions from one or more sources. Dispersion-enhancing practices,including excessively tall stacks, lower the predicted ground-level concentrationsand may result in emission limitations which allow sources to emit greatertotal amounts of pollution than if such practices were not employed. Under the revised stack height regulation, some sources may be subjectto emission limitations which are more stringent than those which currentlyapply. Today's final policy has been developed in consideration of thefact that emission reductions mandated by the stack height regulation maybe obtained more cost-effectively by allowing such a source to secure thesereductions at (an)other source(s), in lieu of reducing emissions at itsown facility. For purposes of this policy, the source which is subjectto more stringent emission limits is called the ``affected source''; thesource which provides the emission reductions needed to satisfy such limitsis called the ``providing source''. This joint satisfaction of an emissionreduction obligation is referred to as an ``emissions balance.'' Under Clean Air Act section 110 and 40 CFR Part 51, a SIP revision establishingemission limits for affected sources must provide for full implementationof (i.e., ultimate compliance with) any required emission reduction asexpeditiously as practicable but not later than 3 years from the date EPAapproves the SIP revision. Emissions balances will also be approved through this SIP revision process.To allow sufficient time for arranging balances while assuring prompt ultimatecompliance, the final policy requires EB SIP revisions to be submittedto EPA within 9 months after EPA final approval of the stack height SIPrevision for the relevant affected source. Use of an emission balance willnot be permitted to delay compliance beyond 3 years from the date EPA approvesthe relevant stack height sip revision. The EPA is limiting the period during which emission balances can be submittedto avoid delays in compliance with GEP emission limitations. Dependingon the extent of required emission reductions, significant lead time maybe necessary before actual compliance can be achieved. If a source soughtto apply for an emission balance later than 9 months after receiving arevised emission limitation, it might not be possible for the balance SIPrevision to be approved and for the providing source to reduce its emissionswithin the time required for ultimate compliance with the GEP emissionlimitation. To ensure that balances will have environmental effects equivalent to stack-by-stackcompliance with the July 8 regulation, EPA has concluded that, in lightof potential complexities involved in the stack height regulation, theemission reductions from the providing source must be greater than thereductions required of the affected source by the stack height regulation.In order to facilitate prompt approval of sound applications for emissionbalances, without the potential delay that might otherwise result fromintensive verification of baseline and other factors bearing on equivalentemission reductions, the final policy requires 20 percent more emissionreductions from the providing source than would have been required fromthe originally affected source (i.e. a ``balancing ratio'' of 1 to 1.2),on an annual average basis. The proposal would have barred balance credit from shutdowns or productioncurtailments. The final policy similarly does not allow general use inbalances of emission reductions from plant shutdowns or operation curtailments,but authorizes their consideration in individual cases employing ``loweremissions dispatch'' (LED) where stated criteria are met. The concept ofLED, which explicitly couples the curtailment of operations at high emittingfacilities with the increased use of well-controlled facilities, is currentlybeing analyzed by various states under EPA's State Acid Rain (STAR) grantprogram, in part to determine whether that approach could be generallyauthorized in future Agency actions. However, because EPA does not yetknow how reductions from LED could be adequately calculated, monitored,and enforced, this approach can only be considered on a case-by-case basisin which applicants fully demonstrate that these concerns will be satisfactorilyaddressed. As stated at C.3 in the final policy, sources must submit acontingency plan that could take effect if the LED proposal is disapproved.Applicants who elect to pursue this case-by-case approach should be awarethat inquiries needed to satisfy such concerns may add delays to an alreadytight timetable, and that in no case will these delays be considered ajustification for extending the 3-year ultimate compliance deadline. EPA's December 23, 1985 proposal considered placing limits on the relativedifference in stack heights of the providing and affected sources. TheAgency has subsequently determined that any such limit would both unnecessarilyincrease the policy's complexity and decrease the effectiveness of theprogram. The final policy therefore imposes no constraints based on actualor effective stack height differences. Because of potential administrative and enforcement difficulties with balancesthat transcend a single state's jurisdiction, today's policy generallylimits balances to facilities within state boundaries. However, this policyrecognizes a specific exception in the case of interstate air quality controlregions (AQCR's). In such interstate areas, states have already developedenforceable interstate processes for attaining and maintaining ambientair quality standards. Therefore, this policy also allows the balancingof emission reductions among sources within an interstate air quality controlregion. In brief, today's policy allows an affected source to meet more stringentemission limitations required by the revised stack height regulation bysecuring emission reductions from another source or sources within thesame state or interstate AQCR, subject to a ``balancing ratio'' of 1 to1.2 and other safeguards (see sections A and B of the policy) designedto assure that reductions at least equivalent to those expected from stack-by-stackcompliance will be obtained. Analyses of the likely effects of such emissions balancing have consistentlyindicated that it will produce equal or greater emission reductions atsubstantially less cost than conventional compliance without balancing.\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>Analysis of the Promulgated Stack-Height Regulations With and WithoutEmissions Trading,</T3> ICF, Inc., August 1986, Docket Item andplusmin;IV-A-1.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Response to Comments on December 23, 1985 Proposal </ITAG>EPA received 24 comments addressing the proposed policy. Minor commentshave been consolidated according to the issues raised and are summarizedalong with EPA's responses in a detailed response to comments documentincluded in the docket. Comments which addressed issues fundamental todevelopment of the final policy are briefly summarized and responded tobelow. A. LegalityThree commenters asserted that use of emissions balancing would not squarewith the statute, claiming that section 123's bar on crediting ``excess''stack height (i.e., stack height exceeding GEP) when developing applicableSIP emission limits also requires compliance with those limits at the specificstack. They additionally cited <T3>Sierra Club</T3> v. <T3>EPA,</T3> 719 F.2d 436 (D.C. Cir., 1983), which did not address theissues here but generally cautioned EPA to interpret section 123 in a mannerwhich errs on the side of protecting public health.EPA disagrees with these commenters. It is quite true that excess stackheight may not be taken into account when developing SIP emission limits;these limits must treat such stacks exactly as though they were not excessively``tall.'' However, these comments ignore the fact that once such limitsare properly developed, the requirements of section 123 are fulfilled.Resulting emission limits are thereafter no different than any other SIPemission limitation under Clean Air Act section 110, and may generallybe satisfied in the same broad range of ways.\2\<NOTE/> That is particularly true where, as here, balances may onlybe used in areas which have either attained and are maintaining the relevantNAAQS and PSD increments, or are implementing EPA-approved plans for doingso (see today's policy section A.5). Section 123 was not written or intendedto physically eliminate all dispersion of pollutants, but rather to eliminatereliance on undue dispersion when calculating necessary levels of emissioncontrol. Thus, beyond the need to assure the protection of public healthand welfare from actual air quality levels in excess of the NAAQS or PSDincrements, there is no need to require site-specific control since, inconjunction with the stack height regulation, the policy assures that noundue reliance on dispersion exists. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Compare, e.g., Final Emissions Trading Policy, 51 FR 43814(Dec. 4, 1986).No different result is required by some commenters' reliance on statutoryand regulatory language prohibiting emission limitations that are ``affectedin any manner'' by ``so much of the stack height of any source'' that exceedsGEP. Section 123 itself refers to ``the degree of emission limitationsrequired for control of any air pollutant under an applicable implementationplan,'' not for control of any air pollutant emitted by a specific sourceunder such a plan. Moreover, the cited passages uniformly refer to theprocess by which initial SIP limitations must be developed under section123_a process which is necessarily source-specific, since it turns on suchfactors as the individual source's stack height, plume rise, and interplaywith emissions from other nearby sources. See, e.g., 40 CFR 51.12(j) (1985).These provisions simply do not reach the question of how such limits, onceproperly set, may be satisfied. Once those limits are properly set, emissionbalances change neither the overall degree of emission limitation nor theamount of total reduction required under the applicable plan, other thanto provide greater reduction.Nor is a different result required by comments that ``grandfathered'' stacksnot subject to section 123 should not be allowed to provide reductionsfor emissions balances. That Congress refused to mandate further restrictionson stacks constructed before 1971 says nothing about their ability to voluntarilyreduce emissions further as part of an emission balance. Indeed, securingfurther, cost-effective reductions from exempted stacks constitutes anadditional justification for allowing these sources to be providing sourcesin an emissions balance.B. Emissions Balancing RatioThe proposed policy requested comment on a range of ratios between 1 to1.2 and 1 to 2, noting without explanation that EPA ``preferred'' the higherratio. Two comments supported this 1 to 2 ratio. Ten comments supporteda 1 to 1 ratio, asserting that EPA lacked authority to require more thanequivalent emission reductions. Three commenters supported 1 to 1.2, statingthat this ratio should provide more than adequate environmental equivalenceand that any higher ratio would discourage balances and could thereforeresult in less overall environmental benefit. Seven commenters suggestedother ratios or ratioing techniques.Providing source(s) must reduce emissions of the same pollutant, calculatedon an annual average basis, to an extent 1.2 times (i.e., twenty percentmore than) the emission reduction required of the affected source (or 1.2times that portion of the required reduction for which the affected sourceis seeking an emissions balance). Because of the extremely short time availableto develop, approve, and implement emisson balances under the three-yeardeadline, and the potential delays produced by the detailed examinationneeded to assure equivalence, EPA believes that the 1 to 1.2 ratio is neededto help ensure overall environmental results at least equivalent to thosewhich would result if all emission reductions had occurred at the affectedsource. Given that NAAQS and PSD increments are required to be attained,that real reductions from a lower-of-actuals-or-SIP-allowables (or remodeledSIP allowables, if remodeling is required) emissions baseline are requiredfrom each providing source, and that the policy contains other safeguards,EPA believes that a 1 to 1.2 ratio provides adequate assurance of equivalenceand that no higher ratio is required. The 1 to 1.2 ratio would also yieldthe least costly reductions from the range of ratios evaluated.C. Credit for Shutdowns, Curtailments or Lower Emissions Dispatch (LED)The proposed policy would have barred balancing credit for these possibleemission-reducing actions at providing sources, noting potential monitoringand enforcement problems. It further noted that, assuming constant demand,reduced electricity production at one providing facility could result inparallel increases elsewhere. Eleven of thirteen commenters of this issue recommended that emissionsbalance credit be given for reductions derived from lower emissions dispatchor some other form of enforceable curtailment of operations at high emittingfacilities. One commenter suggested that such credit be given on a case-by-casebasis, and one commenter supported the proposed policy. ``Lower emissions dispatch'' is the term used in this policy to describea utility company, holding company, or powerpool management strategy tocontrol emissions by decreasing electricity production at higher emitting(e.g., higher lbs/10 \6\ Btu) power plants, and increasing electricityproduction at lower emitting (cleaner) power plants, rather than distributing(dispatching) electricity production solely on the basis of least cost.Creditable emission reductions in this section 123 context depend not somuch on the production level at a given facility as on a detailed analysisof the change in emissions resulting from the transfer of production fromone facility with one set of controls to another facility with anotherset of controls. Without detailed enforceable provisions relating not onlyto the curtailment of production at a high emitting facility, but alsoto the transfer of production to and emission limits at an identified secondfacility, reductions claimed from LED would not, in general, be sufficientlyreliable. None of the commenters demonstrated how these emission reductions couldbe reliably enforced. Without assurance that emission reductions derivedfrom curtailments at high emitting facilities would be enforceably coupledwith increased production at low emitting facilities, or would otherwiseassure equivalent or lower emissions, EPA cannot generally authorize emissionsbalances relying upon curtailment. EPA presently does not know how to calculatereductions from or how to adequately enforce LED. However, EPA will reviewsuch proposed methods of achieving reductions for an emissions balanceon a case-by-case basis, where applicants fully document and commit touse enforceable, easily monitored procedures for assuring equivalent emissionreductions. Applicants should be aware that they bear the burden of proofon such showings, which will not constitute grounds for extending the three-yearultimate compliance date described above and in more detail at subsectionsF and G below. D. Relative Stack Height Limits The proposed policy requested comments on four possible options for relativestack height limitations, ranging from no additional restrictions to arequirement that the effective height (i.e., physical stack height plusplume rise) of the providing source be at least equal to that of the affectedsource. Eighteen comments supported no stack height restriction. One commenteradvocated the most stringent option requiring equal or greater effectivestack height, citing concerns that balancing might otherwise increase longrange transport. The final policy does not restrict the relative stack heights of affectedand providing sources. The thrust of section 123 is to limit reliance onundue dispersion when calculating appropriate levels of emissions control.No restriction on relative stack height appears necessary to effectuatethat purpose, and such restrictions would likely result in fewer and morecostly emission reductions that balances could otherwise secure. EPA analysessuggest that emissions balancing without additional stack height restrictionscould secure up to 30,000 tpy more SO<T2>2</T2> reduction (with savings up to $50 million per year more) thanbalancing with additional stack height restrictions.\1\EPA concludes that balances with no restrictions on relative stack heightare likely to provide greater emission reductions and cost savings, aswell as being easiest to implement and enforce compared to the other alternativesevaluated.E. Geographical Boundaries The proposed policy would have limited balances to sources within the samestate or same interstate AQCR. Twelve comments were received discussingthe geographical boundaries appropriate for emissions balancing. Five urgedinterstate balances with few, if any restrictions. Three favored allowingbalances in bordering states as well as within the same state. One favoredthe EPA proposal. Others suggested limiting balances to a single state,or to a geographic area defined to assure that benefits were obtained inthe airshed of the affected source. Several of these comments were basedon assumptions regarding localized ambient concerns or specialized transportconcerns which are not relevant here. The final policy allows balancing as proposed. The language of section123 refers to ``[t]he degree of emission limitation required * * * underan applicable implementation plan * * *.'' (underlining added). EPA believesthat authorizing emissions balancing within a single state or within asingle interstate AQCR will appropriately maintain the policy's environmentaland compliance usefulness without sacrificing administrative feasibility.More than half the potentially affected sources are located within interstateAQCR's and many others offer potential balances within single states. Allowingfull interstate balancing with no restrictions as to state lines couldresult in undue administrative and enforcement problems because many statesmay not be able to enforce and implement an interstate balance in a timelymanner. Conversely, limiting balances to a single AQCR or part of a statecould severely limit the use and environmental benefits of the policy.That approach would sharply reduce the number of potential providing sources,and could therefore limit the speed and ease with which an affected sourcecould meet the conditions of this policy and of the revised stack heightregulation. F. Emissions Balancing SIP Revision Deadline The proposal requested comment on the appropriateness of an October 8,1986 proposed deadline for submittal of emission balancing (EB) SIP revisionsas well as alternative approaches. Eleven comments were received on thistopic. Ten asserted that the October 8, 1986 deadline for submittal toEPA of EB SIP revisions was too short to be met in light of past experiencewith the SIP revision process. One commenter supported the proposed deadline.Several of these comments supported a deadline of nine months after finalpolicy promulgation. They further requested clarification that balancesneed not be submitted with the initial stack height SIP revisions and thatthis deadline was not for actual source compliance, but only for SIP submittal.EPA has concluded that sufficient time for development of balances canbe accommodated without delaying compliance, in a manner different thanthat suggested in the proposal. To provide adequate time for development,approval and implementation of emission balances, states will be allowednine months from the date of EPA final approval of the relevant stack heightSIP revision to submit the emissions balancing SIP revision. EB SIP revisionsneed not be submitted with the stack height SIP revisions. However, inorder to assure that required emission reductions are known, a stack heightSIP revision for an affected source must be submitted prior to or coincidentwith an EB SIP revision for that source. EPA agrees that the nine monthdeadline only applies to submittal of an EB SIP revision, not to actualsource compliance, which is not later than three years from the date thatEPA approves the affected source's stack height SIP revision. This approach will not delay ultimate compliance, since the date by whichan affected source must meet its revised emission limits will not changeas a result of emissions balancing. EPA encourages states to submit EBSIP revisions expeditiously, to provide affected sources sufficient timeto comply with these requirements. G. Source Compliance Date Two commenters generally stated that the compliance deadline for a sourceshould be determined on a case-by-case basis. One also indicated that case-by-casecompliance date determinations were especially appropriate for sourcesproposing to use innovative technologies as part of balances. Under the final policy, the compliance date for an emissions balance isthe same as provided by 40 CFR 51.110(b)_as expeditious as practicable,but not more than three years from EPA approval of the relevant stack heightSIP revision.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: December 23, 1987. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.

Background On July 8, 1985 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated therevised stack height regulation required to implement section 123 of theClean Air Act, 50 FR 27892. The regulation principally affects sourcesemitting SO<T2>2</T2> and limits the credit these and certain other sources can receivefor the height of their stacks and the use of other dispersion techniquesin calculating emission limits. Consequently, some of these sources willbe required to secure emission reductions in order to comply with the stackheight regulation. The likelihood that some required emission reductions could be obtainedin a more cost-effective manner from other sources has given rise to theconcept known as ``emissions balancing'' (EB). This concept would allowsources subject to the stack height regulation to comply in a more cost-effectivemanner while achieving an equal or greater overall environmental result.II. Policy Discussion This policy authorizes a source directly affected by the stack height regulation(``affected source'') to obtain any required emission reduction from anothersource or sources (``providing source''). However, any source which mustreduce its emissions because of reliance on a prohibited supplemental orintermittent control strategy cannot meet its requirements by obtainingreductions from (an) other source(s). Providing source(s) must reduce emissions of the same pollutant, calculatedon an annual average basis, to an extent 1.2 times (i.e., twenty percentmore than) the emission reduction required of the affected source (or 1.2times that portion of the required reduction for which the affected sourceis seeking an emissions balance). This balance factor has been chosen becauseof the difficulty of ensuring equivalent emission reductions, given thevery short time available for affected sources to submit, receive approvalof, and implement indivdiual balances. Partial balancing and balancing with more than one source are also authorized.This means that an affected source may combine emission reductions at itsown facilities with emission reductions from (a) providing source(s) tosecure the total reductions required. For example, if an affected sourceis required to reduce its emissions by 10,000 tons per year, it may reduceits own emissions by 5,000 tons per year and develop an emissions balanceproviding for an additional 6,000 (5,000 times 1.2) tons per year fromanother source, or it may establish a balance with more than one sourceto secure the entire reduction. This policy applies to sources affected by the revised stack height regulationpromulgated at 50 FR 27892 (July 8, 1985), which sources were in operationas of that date or for which permits to construct or operate had been issuedas of that date. III. Details of Policy <ITAG tagnum="81">A. General Conditions for Approvable Emissions Balances </ITAG>1. Emissions balancing may be permanent or may be used to comply with theregulations temporarily until permanent compliance can be achieved. Withrespect to temporary balancing, the requirements of this policy would applyfor the duration of the temporary balance. 2. An approvable emissions balance must require that the providing source(s)reduce emissions of the same pollutant, calculated on an annual averagebasis, to an extent 1.2 times the emission reduction required of the affectedsource by application of the stack height regulation (or 1.2 times thatportion of the required reduction for which the affected source is seekingan emissions balance). 3. An emissions balance must take place entirely within the boundariesof a single state or single interstate AQCR. With respect to the latter,interstate balances within the same air quality control region will beacceptable if an enforceable interagency agreement or equivalent provisionis incorporated into the SIP's of both States and is approved by EPA. However,the appropriate Regional Office may limit balances to smaller areas ona case-by-case basis if necessary to assure protection of the nationalambient air quality standards (NAAQS) or the prevention of significantdeterioration (PSD) increments.4. Emission reductions from the providing source(s) must be stack emissions,not fugitive emissions.5. Other conditions of an approvable emissions balance are:andbullet; Both the affected and providing sources must be in complianceor on an enforceable schedule for compliance with all applicable federally-approvedSIP requirements;andbullet; All NAAQS for the pollutants involved in the balance must eitherbe attained and maintained within the area of the emissions balance, orthat area must be implementing an EPA-approved SIP providing for such attainmentand maintenance;andbullet; PSD increments must be protected:andbullet; Any applicable SIP requirements for visibility protection mustbe met; andandbullet; States and/or EPA must assure the adequacy of emission limitationsfor the affected and/or providing source(s). This may necessitate case-by-casere-evaluation of emission limitations to protect NAAQS or PSD increments.If any remodeling is required to ensure protection of NAAQS or PSD increments,as part of this re-evaluation, it must conform with EPA's current modelingguidelines \1\<NOTE/>, except that the affected source shall be remodeled usingits actual stack height and current SIP (not new GEP) limits. This remodelingis not intended to allow relaxation of the affected source's allowableSIP limits.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised),</T3> EPA/450/2-78-027R,U.S. EPA, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, July 1986 (or later editions).6. In addition to any emissions limits needed to ensure protection of NAAQSand PSD increments, sources must demonstrate the following. If the providingsource is used to cover the full emission reduction required by applicationof the stack height regulation to the affected source, that reduction mustequal 1.2 times the tons per year of reduction required at the affectedsource absent the emissions balance.\2\<NOTE/> Possible ways to achieve this are by placing an enforceableannual ``cap'' on the production level of the affected source, togetherwith a ``floor'' on the production level (i.e., a minimum production level)on the providing source; or by use of a weighted rolling annual averageemission limit for the affected and providing sources combined, etc. Becauseof the long averaging time (annual) involved in emissions balancing, specialcare should be taken to assure that enforceable means of monitoring complianceare included in the EB SIP revision.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ These are reductions over and beyond any required forthe purpose of protecting NAAQS or PSD increments. See Section II PolicyDiscussion in the final EB policy memorandum for the required tons peryear emission reduction for a partial balance. Guidance which addressesdetailed calculation of emission reductions and ``caps'' will be providedsubsequent to publication of this policy.7. The emissions balance must not cause or contribute to adverse impactson the air quality-related values of any class I area. The Federal LandManager of the class I area shall receive timely formal notification ofany emissions change that may affect management of such lands.8. Sources involved in an emissions balance, like all other sources, maylater be required to make further emission reductions as a result of futureSIP revisions determined necessary to attain or maintain NAAQS or PSD increments.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Calculation of Emissions Balances</ITAG>1. The baseline from which emission reductions may be credited at the providingsource must be the lowest of actual, current SIP allowable or remodeledSIP allowable emissions, if remodeling is needed, and shall be determinedusing procedures consistent with those in the EPA Emissions Trading Policy(51 FR 43814, Dec. 4, 1986). Actual emissions are determined by averagingthe emissions of the providing source over the most recent representativetwo calendar years \3\<NOTE/> unless circumstances (e.g., the recent installation of apermanent control device) warrant a different period of record. Allowableemissions are those emissions allowed by a federally enforceable SIP limit,preconstruction permit, or other equivalent document which is currentlyapproved by EPA as sufficient to provide for attainment and maintenanceof NAAQS and PSD increments.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The final policy changes the actual emissions averagingperiod from three years to two years to be consistent with the EPA ModelingGuidelines, and the Emissions Trading Policy, 51 FR 43814, Dec. 4, 1986.2. Reductions from the providing source(s) must be obtained through useof control equipment, lower-emitting process changes, or cleaner fuels.Emission reductions from intermittent or supplemental control strategies,or any other strategy inconsistent with the stack height regulation arenot acceptable for emissions balances.3. If at some later date, (a) providing source(s) shuts down or curtailsits operations in ways which breach the terms of an emissions balance,the emissions balance will be totally or partially negated, and the affectedsource must make up the difference by reducing its own emissions and/orby arranging an emissions balance with another source, as explained inC.3 below.4. The emission reductions from (a) providing source(s) in an emissionsbalance may not be derived from a control measure: (1) Which is alreadyan approved part of a SIP, (2) for which a commitment for reductions hasbeen approved as a part of a SIP, (3) which has been proposed and is currentlyunder consideration for adoption as a part of a SIP, or (4) which has beenadopted at the state or local level as a necessary SIP control measure.As explained in item C.2. below, however, any new emission limitationsneeded to ensure protection of NAAQS and PSD increments or limitationsneeded to ensure that the required tons/year emission reduction is achievedby the source(s) as a result of an approved balance will become an enforceablepart of the SIP. These provisions are necessary to assure that an emissionreduction made for and credited in an emissions balance is not used forother purposes (i.e., is not double-counted).5. Because of concerns related to potential delay in processing applicationsand the possibility that emissions might increase elsewhere within thesame utility system, emission reductions from shutdowns or load shifting(including lower emissions dispatch (LED), by which utility sources enforceablydirect production to better controlled facilities rather than dispatchingsolely on the basis of least cost) cannot generally be authorized for balancecredit at this time (see Preamble Section II.C above). EPA will considerproposed emissions balances involving credit for LED or other load shiftingtechniques only on a case-by-case basis in which individual applicantsdemonstrate how and by what procedures these concerns will be satisfiedor do not apply. The burden of justifying such proposals by complete, adequateand coherent documentation rests on individual applicants, who should beaware that additional delays in processing balances may result from suchproposals and will not be considered grounds for extending the 3-year compliancedeadline. Because of this, and other reasons stated at C.3, any affectedsource must submit a contingency plan that would take effect and be enforceableif the LED proposal is disapproved. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Procedural Requirements </ITAG>1. An emissions balance must be approved through the SIP revision process.Any new emission limitations needed to ensure protection of NAAQS and PSDincrements, or limitations needed to ensure that the required tons/yearemission reduction is achieved by the sources in an emission balance mustbe submitted to EPA as a SIP revision within 9 months of approval of theSIP revision required by the revised stack height regulation. This provisionin no way extends the requirement to comply with the stack height regulationnot later than 3 years after approval of the stack height SIP revision.Emissions balancing proposals must be open to public scrutiny, and theprocess must provide for full public participation as part of normal SIPrevision procedures. To expedite EB SIP approval, states are encouragedto use the SIP parallel processing procedures explained at page 27073 ofthe June 23, 1982 <T4>Federal Register</T4>. 2. Any new emission limitations needed to ensure protection of NAAQS andPSD increments or limitations needed to ensure that the required tons/yearemission reduction is achieved by the source in an emissions balance willbe enforceable SIP limits. The balance must be incorporated into the SIPwith an explanation of the interrelationship of these emission limitations.The providing source may not be relieved of its obligations under the emissionbalance except through the process of a subsequent SIP revision.4<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>4 However, a subsequent SIP revision is not needed if theEB SIP revision was structured to allow the providing source's previousemission limits to become effective upon proper notice to the state andEPA if the affected source later shuts down, or the balance is terminated.For the previous emission limits to again become effective, an acceptabledemonstration must be submitted to the state and EPA showing that no NAAQSor PSD increment will be jeopardized. 3. The SIP emission limits required by application of the stack heightregulation for an affected source will remain in the SIP as contingentemission limits that will become automatically effective and enforceableagainst the affected source if the providing source shuts down or the balanceis terminated by the sources or by the state. Consequently, the SIP mustcontain a contingency plan for an affected source to reduce its emissionsto the limits required by the stack height SIP revision unless and untilanother emissions balance can be arranged and approved. The contingencyplan could consist of a measure such as the substitution of lower sulfurfuel. 4. Emission reductions by a providing source which are currently used tomeet any other requirements of the Act shall not be creditable for an emissionsbalance. 5. Emission reductions from a providing source will not be creditable againstPSD increments or PSD baseline concentrations. 6. Neither this policy nor individual applications under it shall in anyway delay compliance with the revised stack height SIP limitations. Inparticular, this policy shall not create independent grounds for postponingthe ultimate compliance date by which the emission reductions requiredby the stack height SIP revision are to be achieved. Temporary balancesmay be used to comply with the deadline for emission reductions at theaffected source until permanent means of compliance can be achieved; however,the temporary balance would have to be fully approved and implemented bythe original compliance date for the affected source. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Effect of This Policy </ITAG>The emissions balancing policy sets out general principles for approvingindividual balances affording affected source more flexible, cost-effectiveways to meet the requirements of EPA's revised stack height regulation.As a policy statement, it neither alters applicable legal requirementsnor establishes conclusively how EPA will determine individual applicationsor cases. EPA will process any EB SIP revision submitted by a state asa SIP revision under the provisions of Section 110 of the CAA, and 40 CFRPart 51. Interested parties will have full public opportunity to scrutinizeapplication of these principles in specific cases and to seek subsequentjudicial review if and when EPA takes final action on a particular EB SIPrevision.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-156 Filed 1-6-88; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M  </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
