The scene, on the steps of the Great Hall of the People, was oneof the constant reminders that protesters who have taken over thestreets of Beijing consider halting corruption as important asbringing about democratic reform.   Antipathy toward official corruption is particularly strongamong blue- and white-collar workers who have joined student ranksin demanding radical change from the ruling Communist Party.   Corruption is endemic in Chinese life.   On the petty side, party and government officials use theirpositions to obtain precious train or concert tickets, find jobsfor in-laws, commandeer spacious apartments or weasel trips abroad.   More seriously, officials take advantage of the nation'seconomic disorder to get hold of scarce raw materials such as coaland fertilizer at low state-set prices and then sell them at farhigher prices on the free market.   Officials' access to sought-after goods has also made themeasily susceptible to bribery. Many consider receiving money,lavish banquets, color television sets or stereos all part of thejob.   There is deep resentment of nepotism and the charmed lives ofluxury the sons and daughters of high officials enjoy.   One of the first posters to go up at Beijing University duringthe current student unrest listed several dozen senior officialswho it alleged got their jobs because of family connections.   Premier Li Peng, it noted, was the adopted son of the late ChouEn-lai. People's Liberation Army Chief of Staff Chi Haotian isPresident Yang Shangkun's son-in-law. Senior leader Deng Xiaoping'sson Deng Pufang formerly headed a business concern that has beenaccused of shady dealings.   A recent survey of 10,000 workers indicated corruption isregarded as China's most serious problem. Forty-six percent listedcorruption as China's most serious social problem, and 63 percentsaid improper deeds by party members is a major political problem.   The government has acknowledged its shortcomings and tried tocrack down.   ``All malpractices such as corruption, embezzlement ormisappropriation of public funds, and the squandering of fundsallocated for helping poor people or doing relief work haveseriously harmed the interests of the state and distorted the imageof the party,'' the official party paper People's Daily said.   Chinese courts handled 37,000 cases of official profiteeringlast year, up 50 percent from 1987, and 101 embezzlers andbribe-takers were sentenced to death or life imprisonment.   Local governments have set up neighborhood corruption centerswhere ordinary people can report official abuses of power withoutfear of recrimination.   But as the hundreds of banners on central Tiananmen Squarereading ``Down with corruption'' attest, the government has madelittle headway in rooting out this deeply ingrained problem.</TEXT></DOC>
