A television set ora computer?andP;  And who makes it?andP;  The television industry or the computerindustry?andM;In 1989, American companies dominate the computer industry, and Japanesecompanies dominate the home video industry.andP;  And although we might notbelieve that the home video industry as we currently know it is critical tothe future of the American economy, most observers probably accept thatcontinued American dominance in computers is pretty important.andM;The question is: If they become one and the same industry, will Americanstrengths in computers lead to a strong American position in video?andM;Or will Japanese strength in video lead it to wipe the floor with theAmerican computer industry?andM;My bets, I'm afraid, are with the Japanese.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
