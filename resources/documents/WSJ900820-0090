If Iraqabandoned negotiations too soon, he says, &quot;Iraq's act wassimilar to the action adopted by Western countries. Theymoved forces at once to protect their interests. If Iraq isat fault, Western countries also are at fault,&quot; he says. &quot;Whydidn't they, too, wait for dialogue?&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Geographically, this small rugged land at the foot of theArabian Peninsula is a long way from the unfolding crisis inthe gulf. But politically, it has become a central player. Asthe only Arab state represented on the U.N. Security Council,Yemen is in the hot seat.   When the council first voted to condemn the Iraqi invasionof Kuwait, the Yemeni delegate didn't vote, saying he waswithout instructions. That stand reflected Yemen's intensedilemma, as a close ally of Iraq and major recipient ofKuwaiti aid.   Yemen also abstained on the sanctions resolution but wenton to vote against Iraq's annexation of Kuwait and theholding of foreign captives in Baghdad.   The arrival of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia tilted Yemenfirmly toward Iraq. Yemenis have longstanding grudges againstthe Saudis over a disputed province and over their workers'low status and poor treatment at the hands of the Saudis.   Mr. Saleh is one of a handful of outsiders who have seenSaddam Hussein since the onset of the crisis. The Iraqileader's mood is, he says, unruffled. &quot;He is the same personI have known all these years,&quot; Mr. Saleh says in aninterview. &quot;He loves and wants peace, he rejects war, but insome circumstances, war has been imposed on him.&quot;   Throwing in his lot with Iraq is uncharacteristic for theYemeni president. In his 12-year rule, he has pursued apolicy of strict neutrality, extracting aid from Moscow,Washington and Beijing, and hewing to the consensus view onall Arab issues.   Now, President Saleh finds himself at odds with GeorgeBush, Egypt's Hosni Mubarak and Saudi Arabia's King Fahd. Heproposes that foreign forces withdraw from Saudi Arabia,Iraqi forces withdraw from Kuwait and be replaced by Arabpeacekeeping troops, and an Arab negotiating team then workto mediate a solution.   &quot;Some countries have blamed us&quot; for abstaining on the twokey Security Council resolutions, he says &quot;but does the U.S.want solutions, or only condemnations?&quot; Ideally, he says,Yemen's Security Council seat should represent the Arab blocand even some other Third World nations. &quot;But if there is noconsensus, the point of view will reflect the views of Yemenonly,&quot; he adds.   Yemen is opposed to sanctions against Iraq &quot;for mere humanreasons, because children, women and elderly people willsuffer.&quot; However, Yemen, which itself imports food and can'trefine all its own oil, won't take part in sanctions-busting.&quot;We don't have the resources to do so,&quot; the president says inthe interview.   He also rules out a military role. Some analysts havesuggested that Yemen might use an Iraqi attack on SaudiArabia as an opportunity to attack the Saudis' southern flankand win back the disputed province of Asir. Rumors of tankmovements in the north have been fueled by tighter travelrestrictions near border areas.   But President Saleh denies any such intentions. &quot;Yemenisn't part of the conflict,&quot; he says. He considers his chiefobligation to push for foreign withdrawal. If the U.S. is soconcerned about the sovereignty of Kuwait's ruling family, hesays, &quot;we should remember Panama, where America took apresident out of office by force and brought him to the U.S.for trial.&quot;   Mr. Saleh doesn't think the deep split in Arab opinion isirreversible. &quot;I think the Yemen streets and the Arab streetsall are more angry against some Arab leaderships than theyare with the Americans themselves,&quot; he says. &quot;Arab peopleshould stand together and find solutions, they should notcooperate with imperialists. I think that if foreign forceswithdraw, there is hope for a unified Arab position.&quot;   Mr. Saleh says he considers President Bush &quot;a wonderfulfriend,&quot; wise in domestic administration. But now, he says,the president may be carried away by &quot;the pride of the U.S.as a superpower.&quot; He says he can't see any justification forthe massive U.S. military deployments.   &quot;If it is just to show the power of the U.S., we are allfamiliar with that,&quot; he says. &quot;The U.S. used to talk aboutindividual Palestinians as terrorists, but the U.S. isterrorizing by fleets, warships, aircraft. It is terrorizingthe whole world.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
