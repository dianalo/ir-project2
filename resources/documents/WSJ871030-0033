The Illinois Democrat last night issued a statement that he &quot;would be glad to revisit the $5 million limitation on acquisition indebtedness in conference.&quot; In deficit-reduction legislation narrowly passed by the House yesterday, one provision would deny deductions for interest expense that exceeds $5 million a year on debt supporting either the acquisition of the majority of another corporation's stock or a company's buy-back of a majority of its own stock.    Wall Street has claimed that the market crash was precipitated by the approval of that provision by the House Ways and Means Committee earlier this month. But Rep. Rostenkowski said, &quot;I totally reject the assertion.&quot;    Nevertheless, Rep. Rostenkowski acknowledged that there was pressure on him to indicate flexibility on the controversial provision. &quot;Some have suggested that a statement from the Ways and Means Committee may serve to calm some of the apprehensions of a very nervous Wall Street.&quot;    In the statement, he stressed that the provision &quot;has absolutely no retroactive effect.&quot; Any acquisition in accordance with a letter of intent, tender offer, or other announced intention to go forward that was outstanding on Oct. 13 is exempt from the provision, he said. &quot;Consequently, it should have no effect on stock prices of companies presently the target of takeover attempts,&quot; Rep. Rostenkowski said.    The Senate Finance Committee rejected tax provisions designed to slow merger and acquisition activity, and the Reagan administration has expressed its opposition to the interest limitation on takeovers. The House bill also would create a &quot;corporate raider tax&quot; on the &quot;greenmail&quot; gain from stock that is bought back from an unwanted suitor at a premium.    While Rep. Rostenkowski indicated his willingness to modify the takeover measure, he reiterated the desire of his committee's Democrats to &quot;address unwarranted tax incentives for corporate mergers and acquisitions, and the present benefit corporations receive for replacing corporate equity with debt.&quot;    As congressional leaders and the White House work on the deficit-reduction package that is expected to contain some taxes, a possible compromise on the merger provision would be to limit its effect to hostile takeovers, sources said. There could be problems, however, with attempting to define what is hostile. For example, if a company wants to be acquired but contends the offering price is too low, a question would arise over whether the transaction is hostile. </TEXT></DOC>
