 We did not do as well as wehoped, but we recorded strategic successes that will contribute to good Ayear.&quot;andM;Treybig continued, &quot;This is illustrated by the fact that we gener- atedrecord revenue from new account activity and closed new ac- counts at asubstantially better rate than in previous second quarters.andP;  This successcame from all four major systems areas.&quot;andM;&quot;NonStop CLX midrange computer systems continued to generate the majority ofnew accounts,&quot; Treybig said.andP;  &quot;Our NonStop Cyclone mainframe computer systemand NonStop SQL database management software were chosen for a database ofrecord by WorkCover Corp., the Workers Compensation and Rehabilitation Corp.andO;of the State Government of South Australia.andP;

Treybig said.andP;  &quot;Array is a leader in technology fordisk subsystems based on redundant arrays of inexpensive disks (RAID).andM;As storage technology becomes an even more critical factor in our business,this merger will complement our computer systems ar- chitecture by offeringcustomers an additional option for storage subsystems with high availability,performance, and reliability.&quot;andM;&quot;We continue to feel positive about the year,&quot;
