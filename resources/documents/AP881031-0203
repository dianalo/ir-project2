Two fishermen escaped the Saturday morning attack by diving intothe Arauca River and swimming a half-mile to a ranch near theborder town of El Amparo, sources there said.   The Venezuelan-Colombian border incident, the bloodiest inyears, took place at Guafitas, 360 miles southwest of Caracas.   Interior Minister Simon Alberto Consalvi said the victims were``peaceful Venezuelan fishermen,'' not members of Colombia'sNational Liberation Army as the Defense Ministry originally stated.   ``President (Jaime) Lusinchi has ordered a wide, summaryinvestigation into the incident,'' Consalvi told The AssociatedPress on Monday.   Grimelda de Marquez, an El Amparo government official, said in atelephone interview the fishermen ``carried no weapons at all. Atmost some had just knives, as any ordinary fishermen do.   ``They were going to have a chicken stew when soldiers startedto fire. They were all honest people.''   She quoted the two survivors, Jose Hugueto Arias and VollmerGregorio Pinilla, as saying the 14 bodies ``were bullet-riddledbeyond recognition.''   Other sources in El Amparo, speaking on condition of anonymity,quoted the two as calling the shooting _ a land attack supportedfrom the air _ a ``slaughter of defenseless, peaceful people whowere sailing toward the beach on a weekend picnic.''   Gen. Humberto Camejo Arias, who commands the special bordersecurity force, was quoted in press accounts immediately after thekilling as saying the group had been armed with light submachineguns, explosives, and grenades, a list of possible kidnap targets,and a map of Venezuelan oil installations in the area.   He was quoted as saying the victims were allegedly members ofthe National Liberation Army, a leftist Colombian guerrilla group.   Pinilla and Arias were transfered under police custody on Mondayfrom El Amparo to police headquarters in neighboring San Cristobal,400 miles west of Caracas, and will give testimony in SanCristobal, the sources reported.   Consalvi blamed the shooting on a ``lamentable confusion'' onthe part of the troops, who are responsible for guarding the riverborder against incursions into Venezuela by Colombian guerrillas.   ``This is the only explanation we have for now,'' he said.   Earlier Monday, the Defense Ministry said 16 Colombians werekilled, but two bodies had yet to be found and 14 were still beingidentified.   A ministry spokesman said Monday the men were part of a group ofabout 50 who were crossing the Arauca to enter Venezuela fromColombia.   Venezuela can pump up to 52,000 barrels per day of oil from thearea, and last year completed an oil pipeline from Guafitas to asmall refinery 90 miles north at San Silvestre.   Venezuela increased its border security in February in responseto a rise in kidnappings of its citizens by alleged Colombianguerrillas.</TEXT></DOC>
