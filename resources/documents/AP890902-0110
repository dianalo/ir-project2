As they did last weekend, residents taunted the marchers duringtheir 12-block route through the Brooklyn neighborhood ofBensonhurst. But police officers outnumbered demonstrators,preventing any physical confrontations.   There were no arrests, said police spokesman Sgt. Peter Berry.   The demonstration was sparked by the Aug. 23 shooting death of16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins during an attack by a white gang inBensonhurst.   Most of the residents' taunts were directed at the Rev. AlSharpton, the controversial black activist who organized the march.In response, the marchers chanted ``Yusuf, Yusuf'' and ``No justice,no peace!''   Hawkins was killed in Bensonhurst when he and three friends wereconfronted by about 30 whites carrying baseball bats and golf clubswho were looking for black friends of a white neighborhood girl,police said.   Hawkins, who didn't know the girl and was in Bensonhurst to lookat a used car, was shot twice in the chest. Seven people have beenarrested, including the alleged gunman, Joseph Fama.   The slaying prompted demonstrations last weekend, and a marchwith 7,500 people on Thursday led to a brawl near the BrooklynBridge which left 44 police officers injured.   The marchers Saturday did not go through an Italian festivalbeing held in the neighborhood, as Sharpton had said they would;instead, they marched about two blocks away.   ``We have no problem at all in crashing their party because theycertainly crashed this family,'' Sharpton had said.   Marchers last weekend were met with racial slurs and chants of``Go home,'' while some residents taunted black protesters byholding watermelons aloft.   ``I don't think Bensonhurst will ever change, being the peoplehere are ignorant,'' said Tina Treglio, a resident who watchedSaturday's march. ``People teach their kids to be prejudiced. ...They're not talking about that the killing was senseless.''   Fama was ordered held without bail Friday on charges of murder,felony assault, riot, weapons possession, civil rights violations,harassment and menacing. The other suspects have been released onbail of $75,000 to $100,000.</TEXT></DOC>
