The parent of Pan American World Airways said it willcontinue to operate its usual flight schedule and expressedconfidence that the bankruptcy-law filing will allow it torestructure its finances. Its officials said they believe PanAm ultimately will emerge from the court proceedings as amore healthy airline.</LP><TEXT>   But this will be far from easy. In recent years, NewYork-based Pan Am has been able to squeeze through onefinancial crisis after another only by selling assets itaccumulated in its heyday as the U.S.'s pre-eminent flagshipcarrier: the Pan Am building in New York and the carrier'sfamed Pacific service, and more recently, the proposed saleof its prized London operations. Now, Pan Am has little elseleft to sell.   Its latest troubles stemmed partly from the recession andpartly from the fear of war in the Middle East, which hascaused fuel prices to rise and also curtailed internationaltravel.   In recent days, the company's cash position dwindled tonearly nothing. Based on one estimate, the carrier could haverun out of money to pay its bills by this weekend. In itsfiling in federal court in New York, Pan Am listed totalassets of $438 million and liabilities of $89.2 million as ofSept. 30. Its shares sank 37.5 cents to close at 75 cents inNew York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, onvolume of more than 1.7 million shares.   Pan Am's Chapter 11 filing jolted holders of the airline'shigh-yield, below-investment-grade &quot;junk&quot; bonds, whichalready were trading at deeply depressed levels. Pan Am's 131/2% bonds, due 2003, lost more than one-third of theirmarket value yesterday, sinking to nine cents on the dollar.   &quot;The only other option would have been to suspendoperations,&quot; Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett said in aninterview, acknowledging this would have meant liquidation ofthe airline.   The bankruptcy-law filing will provide Pan Am someimmediate relief. Because of the decision, Bankers Trust NewYork Corp. agreed to give Pan Am $150 million that will allowit to keep flying. UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, which ishoping to close soon the important purchase of Pan Am'sLondon routes, also agreed to guarantee repayment of $50million of that $150 million.   Pan Am's best hope ultimately may lie in a transactionwith another carrier. Some of the possible scenarios are thatUnited could buy Pan Am out of bankruptcy court, or TransWorld Airlines owner Carl Icahn, who has already indicatedinterest in buying Pan Am, could unleash a hostile bid forthe company. Mr. Plaskett, for his part, indicated theBankers Trust-United financing essentially killed anypossible pact with Mr. Icahn. &quot;I have a better deal than heever talked about,&quot; Mr. Plaskett said. Still, a lone Pan Amfaces an uphill battle, people in the industry said. There isuncertainty about whether Pan Am could enter next winterstrong enough to survive the season's losses.   Pressures began mounting on Pan Am last month. On Dec. 21,Airbus Industrie, a European aircraft consortium, pulled theleases on 21 planes, largely because Pan Am executivescouldn't promise the carrier would pay future bills, letalone current ones. Airbus had already been strung along foralmost a year by agreeing to defer lease payments. Still, Mr.Plaskett remained optimistic: &quot;The reports of our death aregreatly exaggerated,&quot; he said in an interview then. &quot;Don'tlay us on a shroud.&quot;   Pan Am had cut the deal with United to sell Pan Am'sLondon operations and other assets for $400 million. But thesale, which Pan Am believed would have given it the neededcushion to survive the slow winter season, was slowed bytalks between the U.S. and British governments, which mustapprove the international route transfer.   Separately, the U.S. Transportation Department gavetentative approval to the London route sale. In a show-causeorder, the department cited Pan Am's need for a &quot;cashinfusion and the opportunity to retrench and consolidate itsoperations.&quot;   Pan Am is believed to have been prompted into bankruptcycourt as a condition for financing from Bankers Trust andUnited. Both companies agreed to give Pan Amdebtor-in-possession financing, a type of funding that isarranged for a company under reorganization. The lenders getpriority liens on all of the unencumbered assets at thecompany and typically get paid back before other creditorsdo.   For the past several days, Pan Am executives had beentrying to stave off a shutdown of service by trying toarrange some form of financing. The company's directors metMonday night to consider and approve the decision to make thefiling.   It is understood that United executives wanted a positivesignal from the Transportation Department before they agreedto participate in any cash infusion into Pan Am. Thedepartment, in a separate order, tenatively cleared the saleof a TWA route between Chicago and London to AMR Corp.'sAmerican Airlines, a transaction that has been pending beforethe department since December 1989. Objections to the routetransfers must be filed by Jan. 18, with replies due Jan. 23.   The Pan Am-United pact also will have to clear a hurdlewith Pan Am's bankruptcy court judge, Cornelius Blackshear,who said he will hold hearings tomorrow on the sale, as wellas Pan Am's financing arrangements. Separately, the JusticeDepartment said the bankruptcy-law filing wouldn't affect itsreview of the United-Pan Am transaction for possibleantitrust violations.   Brian Moreau, president of the airline's flight attendantsunion, said after being awakened before dawn yesterday withnews of the filing: &quot;It's a relief for us. We've been fearingthis day for so long.&quot;   Pan Am was founded in 1927 by Army Capt. J.K. Montgomeryto haul mail between Key West, Fla., and Havana, Cuba. Itmerged that year with Florida Airways and Juan Trippe'sAviation Co. of America. From there, Mr. Trippe took theairline so global that it was considered an appendage of theU.S. State Department.   Pan Am's bankruptcy-law proceedings represent the secondsuch filing in the airline industry since the Iraqi invasionof Kuwait on Aug. 2. Continental Airlines, the nation'sfifth-largest carrier, filed for Chapter 11 protection fromcreditors in early December. It, too, blamed high jet-fuelprices. The Houston-based carrier is a unit of ContinentalAirlines Holdings Inc. In March 1989, Eastern Airlines made aChapter 11 filing, and the airline's day-to-day managementwas assigned to a court-appointed trustee in April 1990.Eastern also is unit of Continental Airlines Holdings, whichstill holds the airline's equity.   In the third quarter, the latest period reported, Pan Amshowed signs of its hemorrhaging. It posted a net loss of$29.1 million, or 19 cents a share, compared withyear-earlier net income of $458,000. Pan Am, the country'sseventh-largest airline, listed cash on hand of only $30million in its filing. It hasn't reported its fourth-quarterresults.   The company is laying many of its hopes for its survivalwith the sale of its Northeast shuttle. Mr. Plaskett said thecompany has two &quot;credible&quot; bids for the shuttle, whichconnects New York with Boston and Washington, D.C., adding,&quot;We are accelerating those discussions.&quot;   It is understood that Portland, Ore.-based PacifiCorp hasdiscussed buying the shuttle from Pan Am for about $150million in a transaction that would involve having NWA Inc.'sNorthwest Airlines operate the shuttle.   Iowa Acquisition Group Inc., an investment group led by aPan Am pilot, Neil C. Sapp, said it sent a letter to Mr.Plaskett earlier this month, offering to buy Pan Am's shuttlefor $150 million. The group said it sent Pan Am lettersshowing it had arranged to obtain financing for the purchasefrom Secor Industries International Inc., a unit of AtlasInternational Inc., a Tampa mining, construction andindustrial development concern. It said Pan Am has asked foradditional information about the financing.   ---   Wade Lambert and Laurie McGinley contributed to thisarticle.   ---                  Pan Am's Perilous Year                                                                                                          March 1, 1990: Persuades creditors to defer $106.4 millionin bills and raises cash through aircraft sale/leasebacks.
