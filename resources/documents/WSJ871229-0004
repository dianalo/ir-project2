The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration had proposed fines of $245,000 last week. The agency said the bulk of the violations were willful, involving record-keeping omissions at Shell's refinery in Deer Park, Texas. Shell also agreed to review and correct injury and illness records back to 1984 at about 200 plants under federal jurisdiction. The safety agency said that Shell has finished the review.    Shell, a Houston-based affiliate of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, agreed to the settlement without admitting guilt as to the charges, OSHA said.    OSHA defines a willful violation as one in which an employer knows about workplace conditions that don't meet federal requirements or was aware of a hazardous condition but didn't make a reasonable effort to correct it.    Shell &quot;strongly objects&quot; to OSHA's characterization that the alleged violations were &quot;willful,&quot; and the company never agreed that they were, a Shell spokesman said. He added, &quot;The company has an exemplary worker safety and health record, a fact the government has never challenged.&quot;    The spokesman said Shell agreed to the settlement &quot;to avoid further litigation and expense&quot; and to resolve the issue.    The agency has said that faulty reporting of injuries and illnesses hampers an employer's ability to pinpoint hazards that need correcting and limits OSHA's ability to focus its inspections on companies with the worst health and safety records. The agency said the Shell citations resulted from an OSHA inspection of the Texas manufacturing complex that began June 16, 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
