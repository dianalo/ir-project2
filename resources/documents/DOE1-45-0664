<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-45-0664 </DOCNO><TEXT>A global survey has been made of pollutant emissions of carbon monoxideand hydrocarbons into the atmosphere up to the end of the last decade.The predominant man-made source of these compounds remains the incompleteburning of fossil fuels and other carbon-containing materials. Well over80% of the carbon monoxide and just over 50% of the gaseous hydrocarbonsare derived from the combustion of petroleum derivatives. In contrast,coal now accounts for only 1% of the emissions of these compounds, duemainly to the decreasing demand for coal in transportation. Of the variousother sources, both natural gas and the use of solvents remain importantfor the liberation of hydrocarbons into the atmosphere, while the incinerationof urban solid waste yields significant amounts of both hydrocarbonsand carbon monoxide. The use of emission factors for every source andsub-source shows that, overall, man-made emissions of carbon monoxidehave increased from 486 Tg/a in 1965 to 891 Tg/a in 1979, while thoseof hydrocarbons have risen from 132 Tg/a to 235 Tg/a over the same period.Thus both emissions have been increasing at over 4%/a and if, as seemslikely, this trend continues, they will exceed the corresponding naturalemissions by the early part of the next century.</TEXT></DOC>
