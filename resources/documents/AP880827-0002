(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sports entrepreneur George Shinn saidFriday he is withdrawing his bid for PTL because he could notcompete with a Canadian company's $113 million offer for the2,200-acre Christian retreat and theme park.   ``Based upon our evaluation of the PTL property as of today andour desired uses, we cannot compete with the offer currently on thetable,'' Shinn said in a statement.   Shinn, majority owner of the new Charlotte Hornets of theNational Basketball Association and the Charlotte Knightsminor-league baseball team, originally offered $75 million forPTL's assets, including $25 million in cash.   PTL trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton said on Wednesday that theleading bidder for PTL was Canadian real estate magnate PeterThomas, representing Samoth Capital Corp.   Benton said he expected by Sept. 1 to have a firm offer fromThomas for the Heritage USA theme park, television network andother property near Fort Mill, S.C.   ``We have expressed to Mr. Benton and Mr. Thomas our best wishesfor a prompt and successful completion of their proposed sale,''Shinn said.   PTL, with debts of up to $130 million, has been reorganizing inU.S. Bankruptcy Court since June 1987, three months after founderJim Bakker resigned amid a sex-and-money scandal.   Bakker also wants to buy PTL's assets and said two weeks agothat he was prepared to pay at least $77 million in cashimmediately. By comparison, Thomas has offered to pay $46 millionin cash and finance the rest of the purchase price over five years.   Asked whether he thinks Shinn's dropping out improves Bakker'schances, Bakker attorney Ryan Hovis said, ``I don't think it makesany difference.</TEXT></DOC>
