Under the proposal, the premium would increase to 23 centsfor each $100 of domestic deposits from the current 19.5cents, FDIC Chairman William Seidman said after a speech tothe Institute of International Bankers. He said the FDICboard will vote on the plan later this week and propose thepremium increase for public comment in time for it takeeffect June 30.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Seidman said the agency would borrow the money fromone of four sources: the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board,the banking industry, or the Federal Financing Bank, whichcoordinates borrowing for government entities. Under theproposal, the Bank Insurance Fund would pay back the money,with interest, over 15 years.   The insurance fund recapitalization plan was expected.Earlier this month, the banking industry, after lengthynegotiations had proposed that the FDIC borrow $10 billionfrom the industry to replenish the fund. However, theindustry, which is very concerned about the rapid increase inpremiums from just 12 cents until Jan. 1, had proposed aspecial assessment based on bank assets to pay for the loans,along with several measures to cap premiums at the current19.5 cents.   At a time when about 10% of the nation's banks are losingmoney, the premium increase will be difficult for some banks,particularly in the Northeast. Bankers want assurances thatpremiums won't keep rising quickly. &quot;Banks aren't abottomless pit,&quot; said Martin Regalia, senior vice presidentof National Council of Savings Institutions.   The plan may also attract criticism from Congress today,when Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady testifies before theSenate Banking Committee on the Bush administration's plan torewrite bank laws. Members of Congress believe that thegovernment must rebuild the deposit insurance fund beforeundertaking more-sweeping reforms, and many in Congress worrythat $10 billion won't be enough.   Over the past four years, some 800 bank failures have costthe FDIC's Bank Insurance Fund $23 billion, reducing the fundto $8.5 billion at the end of 1990. If the current recessionis mild and ends by the middle of this year, the FDICprojects the fund, which insures deposits of up to $100,000,will shrink to $3.9 billion by the end of this year and $2.4billion at the end of 1992. A longer recession could depletethe fund by the end of this year and drive it $5.8 billioninto the red by the end of 1992.   Under the gloomy projection, a $10 billion increase in thefund will be enough to finance the resolution of bankfailures through the end of this year without any newlegislation. However, the FDIC recently sent the Treasuryproposals for borrowing more money, if necessary, to keep thefund solvent without an infusion of taxpayer funds.   Mr. Seidman yesterday also gave a preview of the FDIC'speriodic report on the real estate market, which indicatesthat U.S. banks haven't slowed real estate lending. In 1990,banks increased residential real estate lending by 15% fromthe previous year, while commercial real estate loans rose10%.   However, bankers cut back on the most risky real estatelending. Land acquisition and construction loans fell by2.4%. Office construction fell 14% from the previous year.The full report will be released Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
