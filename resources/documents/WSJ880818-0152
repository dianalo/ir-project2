In an opinion issued Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld $100,000 in sanctions against a Manhattan lawyer and his former law firm for pursuing a false claim in a copyright infringement suit.    Lawyers following the case believe the court's decision marks an expansion of judges' authority to impose sanctions. The actual text of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides for sanctions against a lawyer who signed a false claim but does not discuss whether sanctions may be imposed on the lawyer's firm as well.    Federal sanctions have come under fire recently by critics who charge that they are applied disproportionately against plaintiffs' attorneys, particularly in civil rights cases. &quot;By holding all the partners liable, this case pushes Rule 11 even farther,&quot; said Georgene Vairo, a professor at Fordham University School of Law.    The appeals court's decision affirmed sanctions of $50,000 against Ray L. LeFlore and $50,000 against his former law firm, Pavelic andamp; LeFlore, which was dissolved in 1986 after U.S. District Judge Robert W. Sweet imposed the sanctions.    The firm's client, Northern J. Calloway, sued Marvel Entertainment Group, his former attorney and several others nearly six years ago alleging they infringed his copyright in a script for a proposed movie, &quot;The Skyrider,&quot; which was never produced. A jury ruled for the defendants in 1986.    Judge Sweet then imposed the sanctions based on a false claim by Mr. Calloway and his lawyer that Mr. Calloway's name had been forged on several contracts.    The appeals court said it believed that sanctions should in most cases be imposed on both the signer and the law firm. The partners of Pavelic andamp; LeFlore not only shared profits and expenses equally, wrote Judge Ralph K. Winter in the opinion, but handled Mr. Calloway's litigation as a firm. Mr. LeFlore's lawyer, William Piel, now retired from the New York law firm Sullivan andamp; Cromwell, declined comment, and Mr. LeFlore could not be reached. </TEXT></DOC>
