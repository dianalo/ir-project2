The {sup 3}H:{sup 14}C isotoperatios of steroid metabolites indicated that the biosynthetic pathwaysto 17 alpha,20 beta-diOHP in the testes differed from those observedin the ovaries and head kidneys. [4-{sup 14}C]progesterone appeared tobe the principal precursor of 17 alpha,20 beta-diOHP in the testes, whereasboth precursors were efficiently biotransformed to 17 alpha,20 beta-diOPHin the ovaries and head kidneys. 17 alpha-Hydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17alpha-OHP) was the immediate precursor to 17 alpha,20 beta-diOHP in alltissues. However, appreciable amounts of 17 alpha,20 beta-diOHP accumulatedin vitro in the testes only in the presence of exogenous [{sup 14}C]progesterone.Incubation of the testes, ovaries, and head kidneys with [{sup 14}C]pregnenoloneresulted in high yields of 17 alpha,20 beta-diOHP in the ovaries andhead kidneys but no detectable amounts of the steroid in the testes.The results confirm that progesterone is the favored precursor to 17alpha,20 beta-diOHP in the testes. The results also suggest that thehead kidneys may be an excellent cellular source of 17 alpha,20 beta-diOHPin both male and female. Atlantic salmon and may play an important rolein the sexual maturation process in this fish. It is suggested that biosyntheticcontrol mechanism affecting 17 alpha,20 beta-diOHP synthesis and/or spermiationand ovulation may differ in male and female Atlantic salmon.</TEXT></DOC>
