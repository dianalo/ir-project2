International aid officials on the Thai-Cambodian border said onereport claimed there were hundreds of casualties, but that reportcould not be confirmed. No casualties have been taken tointernationally-aided medical facilities, the officials said.   The shelling is believed to have come from Vietnamese forcesoccupying Cambodia or forces of the Vietnamese-installed governmentin that country.   The refugees fled the Khao Phlu area, in Thailand's eastern Tratprovince about 3{ miles from the Cambodian border, after theartillery and rocket attacks peaked Nov. 15-19, said a Thai militaryofficer who requested anonymity.   They fled back to Ta Luan, a camp several miles west from whichthe Khmer Rouge had forcibly moved them, Thai military officers said.   From Nov. 16-19, 249 artillery rounds crashed into the area, saidan officer of the Eastern Chantaburi-Trat Field Force.   Reporters visiting the Trat border last week could hear thesporadic boom of shelling in the jungled hills. Thai officers saidtoday the shelling had ended.   They said Thai authorities were working with the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross and the United Nations Border ReliefOperation to help any Cambodians who may have been wounded.   The Khmer Rouge, the largest guerrilla group fighting theVietnamese, moved the population from Ta Luan from June toSeptember, leaving behind 1,000-2,000 disabled, elderly or sickpeople.   In a radical bid to fashion a new agrarian society, the KhmerRouge killed hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled Cambodiafrom 1975 until Vietnam invaded in late 1978.   It moved the Ta Luan population apparently to try to populateareas just inside Cambodia that were evacuated by Vietnamese forcesbeginning last year. The international relief agencies and the U.S.State Department have condemned the movements to Khao Phlu, aheavily mined, malarial region.   Thai military officers said Thursday that fighting has picked upsince early October, with shells striking six Thai border provinces.Fighting is expected to intensify further in the next few weeks withthe approaching dry season.   Vietnam has withdrawn some troops 19 miles from the Thai borderarea to ease tensions with Thailand.   But Lt. Patana Jiranant of the Eastern Chantaburi-Trat FieldForce said, ``Fresh units being sent in to free others near the(Thai-Cambodian) border would suggest Vietnam's new readiness toengage in escalated fighting with the Cambodian resistance groups.''</TEXT></DOC>
