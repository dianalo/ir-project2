The troubled transaction leaves Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. and Salomon Inc. stuck with about $100 million each in short-term &quot;bridge&quot; loans to Southland, funds that the firms had hoped to quickly recover by selling Southland securities to investors.    But officials at the two firms stressed that barring a collapse of Southland, the setback seems likely to do more damage to the firms' prestige than to their capital strength. Both firms recently had losses of about $50 million each through their participation in the troubled British Petroleum Co. stock offering, and also have sustained trading losses in the market crash.    Still, some sources close to the transaction insisted the firms could face uncertainties if they are unable to close out their loans within the next year.    Meanwhile, sources at Goldman said its recently completed accounting for the month of October showed a pretax loss of about $30 million, or about $20 million after taxes. And in another development related to the market crash, Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. announced that it had losses of about $70 million after taxes, with more than half of the losses coming from the British Petroleum transaction.    Officials at both Goldman and Salomon said yesterday they were disappointed that the Southland financing didn't go forward, but they insisted that the troubled transaction doesn't damage their firms' health.    &quot;It's an unfortunate time in a transaction we still have confidence in, but in no way is this an impairment to the firm,&quot; said Gerald Rosenfeld, chief financial officer of Salomon Brothers Inc., Salomon's securities unit.    &quot;We would have liked to have had the underwriting fee, but given our capital, this is a non-event,&quot; said one Goldman Sachs partner, who asked not to be identified.    The Goldman partner estimated that the two firms would receive $30 million each in fees if the underwriting goes through.    Both firms said that while their original commitment to Southland was $300 million each, they had substantially reduced their risks by getting commercial banks to take on about two-thirds of the loans they made to Southland. The loans were intended to help the Thompson family of Texas complete a management buy-out of Southland, a Dallas-based convenience store operator.    Goldman officials said they had reduced their exposure by $200 million, and Salomon said its risk had been trimmed by $185 million.    The firms also said their loans will pay an attractive interest rate, and they expressed confidence that they would ultimately be able to sell high-yield, high-risk junk bonds to investors to recover their capital.    The loans Goldman and Salomon extended to Southland are set to expire in February of next year. They can be extended at a higher interest rate for another six months. The loans are currently paying five percentage points above the prime rate.    If after a year the loans aren't refinanced by a junk bond sale, the investment banks would be stuck as the most subordinated debt holders, which means that in the event of a default or bankruptcy by Southland, Salomon and Goldman would be the last creditors in line to collect their money.    Such a default or bankruptcy could cause losses to the two securities firms, people familiar with the transaction said. These people also said the securities firms could sustain losses if they were unable to sell enough junk bonds to cover all of the loans outstanding.    Both firms also said they had more than enough capital to sustain a prolonged investment in Southland. Goldman has about $2.2 billion in capital, and Salomon has more than $3 billion.    As for the reports of a $30 million loss in October, a senior Goldman official declined to comment.    Goldman officials said the firm was profitable in October with the exception of its participation in the British Petroleum transaction. They also acknowledged sustaining large losses in trading takeover-related stocks.    Shearson's losses included an after-tax loss of about $46 million from the firm's role as co-underwriter in the troubled British Petroleum share offering. Other losses stemmed from betting on takeover stocks, or so-called risk arbitrage, and from making markets in over-the-counter stocks, said officials at the firm, which is controlled by American Express Co.    American Express was among the most actively traded issues yesterday, closing at $22.50, up $1.50, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Another portion of the loss came from a &quot;mistake&quot; the firm made in recording a trade, according to Peter A. Cohen, chairman. He said the error was the result of tremendous processing problems caused when volume soared to more than 600 million shares on two consecutive days last month, industry sources said.    Mr. Cohen said in a prepared statement that the firm &quot;is continuing its review of operations with a view to controlling expenses and staffing levels.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
