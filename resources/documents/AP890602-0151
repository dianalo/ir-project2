You just can't pull the machete and cut them apart. You have todo very careful surgery which is what we are trying to do,'' saidRuben Berrios Martinez, president of the Puerto Rican IndependenceParty.   ``That's why we refer to it as a transitory state,'' saidBerrios, who was testifying for the second day before the SenateEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, which is consideringlegislation to provide the mechanism for a referendum allowingPuerto Rico's voters to decide the territory's future political andeconomic status.   The panel also heard testimoney from Carlos Romero Barcelo,president of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party andCommonwealth Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon.   The United States gained sovereignty over the island in 1898after the Spanish-American War, and it became a U.S. commonwealthin 1952. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens who pay no U.S. taxes andcannot vote for president, but are eligible for military service.The island gets about $6 billion in aid from the federal governmentannually.   The island's three major political parties have proposedmaintaining its current status as a U.S. commonwealth territorywith ``enhanced'' authority, becoming the nation's 51st state orestablishing an independent republic.   Should the referendum results favor independence, the PRIP hasproposed that a joint transition commission composed ofrepresentatives from the U.S. government and an independent PuertoRico manage the orderly transfer of power.   ``It seems to me that the transition should be a Puerto Ricanaffair,'' said D. Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of the Senatepanel.   However, both Johnston and the committee's ranking Republican,James McClure of Idaho, insisted that details on matters includingcitizenship, migration, taxation, judicial jurisdiction of ongoingcases and election challenges, defense, trade, currency, financeand public debt must be worked out in advance of a proclamation ofindependence and subsequent constitutional convention proposed bythe PRIP.   ``It is inconsistent with independence to have dualcitizenship,'' said Johnston in response to another PRIP proposal.   Fernando Martin, vice president of the independence party saidsuch questions were very important political issues thatcongressional and party staffs would have to iron out to beincluded in any legislation on Puerto Rico's status.   McClure said he was concerned that U.S. military and securityinterests were guaranteed in any independence arrangement.   ``Under independence your government could change. ... We haveto find a way in which we can make foreign military power denial apermanent part of any plan,'' he said.   ``We ought to guarantee Roosevelt Roads for a period,'' addedJohnston.   The Roosevelt Roads Naval Base on Puerto Rico is the largest inacreage in the world outside the continental United States.   The Energy panel plans three days of public hearings on theisland later this month to further fine tune its referendumlegislation, but Johnston said Thursday at least four othercommittees in the Senate would have jurisdiction over varioussections of any final bill.</TEXT></DOC>
