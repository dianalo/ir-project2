Although bidders will have an opportunity to makerevisions and clarifications in their offers, it isn't clearhow far the FDIC will allow them to change their bid price,people involved in the process said. The bids were submittedMarch 29.</LP><TEXT>   The new deadline for the FDIC's decision, originally setfor next Tuesday, is a sign that the bids are so complex thata clear winner hasn't emerged.   A joint bid filed by Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc.,based in Providence, R.I., and the leveraged buy-out firm ofKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. is between $500 million and$600 million, according to someone who has seen theirproposal. But people familiar with the bid made byBankAmerica Corp., say the large San Francisco bank has madea bid that is substantially higher.   People close to Bank of Boston Corp., the third majorbidder, said the bank has been told to clarify by 5 p.m. EDTtoday how it would handle between $6 billion and $8 billionin bad assets that the FDIC will assume. According to theFDIC's bid package for the failed bank, the buyer will bepaid a fee to manage such soured assets for the FDIC, andeventually will give back to the agency those that can't besold off or restored. The FDIC, which initially estimated itscost for seizing the Bank of New England at $2.3 billion,could incur substantial additional costs based on how thebank's troubled assets are handled.   A lawyer for one of the bidders said the FDIC needs moretime because the complexities of three separate bid packagesfor the entire $20 billion-asset Bank of New England has left&quot;thousands of unresolved questions.&quot;   Indeed, representatives from both the Bank of Boston andthe joint Fleet/KKR bidding group have had meetings with topFDIC officials over the past two days.   &quot;The negotiations are continuing,&quot; said one longtimefederal regulator involved in the bidding process. &quot;TheFDIC's delay could mean several things: that the bids weren'tas good as they wanted or that one bidder they didn't reallywant ended up making the highest bid. In any event, the FDICseems far from being satisfied.&quot;   ---   Ralph T. King contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
