The wide-ranging critique by the General Accounting Office said the agency has made only limited progress in administering and enforcing the 1976 law covering the handling, storage and disposal of health-threatening wastes.    The report by the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, cited a variety of problems, including failure to meet congressionally set deadlines, inadequate resources, shifting enforcement approaches and lack of information.    &quot;EPA's progress in regulating hazardous wastes that it has identified has been limited and not sufficiently comprehensive to protect the public and the environment,&quot; the GAO concluded.    The report said the EPA is regulating about 450 materials known to be hazardous, with only five having been added to the list since 1980. Still to be controlled are &quot;potentially large volumes of hazardous wastes,&quot; but the EPA has not determined what industries need to be reviewed nor how long it will take to assess the suspect materials, according to the GAO.    &quot;We believe EPA's limited progress has resulted from the absence of an overall waste identification goal and a related implementation approach that together would focus and assign priorities in the program,&quot; the study said.    The 1976 law, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), was enacted in response to unregulated toxic dumps such as Love Canal near Niagara Falls, N.Y., but the GAO said the law is not preventing new Love Canals.    The study quoted the EPA as saying that as many as half the 5,000 storage and disposal sites regulated under the law may be leaking hazardous materials and could require expensive cleanups. &quot;EPA has made very little progress in achieving actual cleanups or in setting goals for actual cleanups,&quot; the GAO said.    The study said it could take until the year 2025 to clean up the regulated RCRA sites through an effort rivaling &quot;Superfund,&quot; the cleanup program that the EPA says could spend $22.7 billion at some 2,500 abandoned dump sites.    &quot;The longer EPA waits to actually implement corrective action at RCRA facilities, the greater the risk will become that the contamination at the leaking facilities will worsen and that a number of these facilities will have to be cleaned up under Superfund,&quot; the GAO said.    The GAO quoted the EPA as saying the report &quot;adequately describes&quot; the situation and that officials are working to improve the administration of the hazardous waste law on a variety of fronts. </TEXT></DOC>
