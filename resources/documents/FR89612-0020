Background on the New Mexico Program </ITAG>On December 31, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approvedthe New Mexico program. General background information on the New Mexicoprogram, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments,and the conditions of approval of the New Mexico program can be found inthe December 31, 1980, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(45 FR 86459). Subsequent actions concerningNew Mexico's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 931.12,931.15, 931.16, and 931.30. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Proposed Amendment </ITAG>On March 9 and 17, 1989, OSMRE published notices in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 9980 and 54 FR 11183; Administrative RecordNos. NM-480 and NM-484) approving the June 17, 1987, (as revised and clarifiedon February 18, 1988, and August 10, 1988; Administrative Record Nos. NM-356,NM-393, and NM-438), and April 18, 1988 (as revised and clarified on October20, 1988; Administrative Record Nos. NM-405 and NM-452) State-proposedamendments to the rules of the New Mexico program. The Director of OSMREapproved the amendments on the condition that New Mexico would adopt therules in a form identical to that submitted to and reviewed by OSMRE andthe public. By letters dated March 29 and April 26, 1989 (Administrative Record Nos.NM-489 and NM-490), New Mexico submitted to OSMRE copies of the rules thatit had promulgated (effective April 28, 1989) subsequent to OSMRE's approval.Upon comparing the OSMRE-approved rules and the State-promulgated rules,OSMRE identified differences in the two sets of rules. Because SMCRA requiresconsistency between State and Federal standards, OSMRE is further reviewingand soliciting public review of New Mexico's promulgated regulations todetermine whether they are no less effective than the Federal regulationsand no less stringent than SMCRA. The rules for which OSMRE has noted differences between the OSMRE-approvedand State-promulgated rules are: permit and exploration fees, Rule 80-1-5-25(b);water control for coal processing waste banks, Rule 80-1-20-83(b); disposalof noncoal wastes, Rule 80-1-20-89(a) and (d); backfilling and grading,Rules 80-1-20-102(b) and 80-1-20-103(a); inspection and enforcement, Rule80-1-29-11(a); and training, examination, and certification of blasters,Rules 80-1-33-11, 80-1-33-14, and 80-1-33-15(e).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Public Comment Procedures </ITAG>In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSMRE is seekingcomments on whether the amendments satisfy the applicable program approvalcriteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendments are deemed adequate, theywill become part of the New Mexico program.

Comments received after the time indicated under <T2>``DATES'' </T2>or at locations other than the Albuquerque Field Officemay not be considered in the final rulemaking or included in the AdministrativeRecord.
