But MCI defrayed the cost and kept a link to IBM by saying itwould sell IBM a new issue of $400 million in preferred shares. Theshares will give IBM 10 percent of the voting rights in MCI.   Investors reacted positively to the announcement, bidding MCI up75 cents to $16.12{ a share in over-the-counter trading, a 5percent increase.   MCI's stock has doubled from $8 a share a year ago and more thantripled from its low of $5 a share in early 1987. Thesecond-biggest long-distance phone company was staggering then froma bloody 1986 in which it lost $448 million.   Investors have been impressed by Washington-based MCI's abilityto lure big-business accounts and 800-number service away fromAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., the market leader. Also, themultibillion-dollar cost of constructing a nationwide fiber networkis mostly complete.   However, MCI's stock remains far below the peak of $28.50 ashare, adjusted for stock splits, that was reached in 1983. Onecontinuing worry is that MCI could suffer in price battles if ATandamp;Twins the freedom on price-setting it has been seeking.   ATandamp;T, unlike its competitors, requires governmental approvalbefore it can offer special low rates to certain customers to getor keep their business.   IBM's agreement to sell its common shares was not seen as asplit between it and MCI. For one thing, IBM will still have 10percent of the voting rights through its non-tradable issue ofpreferred shares. Also, the companies had not been tightly coupledanyway, in spite of some cooperative marketing and developmentprojects, which will continue.   ``At the time they bought it (the MCI stake), IBM looked at itmore as an insurance policy in case ATandamp;T came up with somethingthat really integrated computers and communications in some sort ofunique, highly value-added way,'' said Charles Schelke, an analystfor Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.   Instead, most companies have since decided it is not importantfor computer makers to own transmission networks, or forlong-distance companies to own computer operations. ATandamp;T, with bigcommitments in both areas, is an exception.   ``This indicates the confidence that the management and thedirectors of MCI have in their future,'' said James M. McCabe, ananalyst for Nomura Securities International Inc.   ``When they did the transaction, it helped MCI that they had abig brother like IBM. In the ensuing period, MCI's fortunes havechanged for the better dramatically,'' McCabe said.   IBM acquired its stake in MCI in March 1986 as part of its saleto MCI of Satellite Business Systems, a long-distancecommunications unit.   MCI is paying less than the market price to repurchase itsstock. At the closing price of $15.37{ a share Wednesday inover-the-counter trading, the roughly 47 million shares would havecost more than $720 million.   The deal was negotiated at a time when MCI's rapidly risingstock was trading at a lower price, Daniel F. Akerson, MCI's chieffinancial officer, said in an interview.   IBM spokesman Michael Starks said the sale represented a gainfor IBM, which had been carrying the stock on its books at a valueof $528 million.</TEXT></DOC>
