The investment world also offers three basic flavors: stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents. Investors generally choose a blend. But what's an easy and pleasant choice for ice cream can be a demanding task in portfolio management.    Brokers want to help. Every major brokerage house puts out advice on asset allocation, suggesting a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents that's intended to take advantage of current market conditions. But in the first half of 1988, most major brokerage houses served up a mixture that proved a bit bland.    Following the advice of the typical big brokerage house, an investor would have gained about 8% over the past six months. In contrast, an investor who simply stuck with a traditional &quot;balanced&quot; blend (55% stocks, 35% bonds and 10% cash) would have made 9%, according to a study by this newspaper and Wilshire Associates of Santa Monica, Calif.    Understandably, most firms began 1988 advising a smaller-than-usual equity position in the wake of last October's stock crash. But in retrospect, that caution hurt their performance. Stocks rose nearly 13% in the past six months, compared to 4.6% for bonds and 3% for cash equivalents.    Over longer periods, brokerage-house advice looks better. For the 12 months and 18 months through June 30, most houses outperformed the typical balanced blend.    Right now, the houses remain cautious. Of 10 large brokerage firms, only four recommend that investors put more than 50% of their money in stocks. Seven of the 10 suggest a cash position of 15% or more.    To evaluate the prowess of brokerage houses at asset allocation, The Wall Street Journal last year began tracking the blends recommended at each of 10 large houses (those with the largest numbers of registered representatives).    Periodically, this newspaper transmits the data to Wilshire Associates, which calculates the return that would be achieved by following the advice of each firm. Wilshire assumes that stock holdings did as well as Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index, bond holdings mimicked the Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. corporate/government bond index and cash equivalents performed as well as 90-day Treasury bills. Portfolios are rebalanced monthly and whenever a firm's advice changes. The Journal then gives the numbers to the brokerage firms, so each house can check its own data for accuracy.    In the accompanying table, the houses are ranked by their 12-month performance through June 30. Six-month and 18-month results are also shown.    PAINEWEBBER: Having urged investors to whittle down stock positions before the crash, PaineWebber Inc. led the field in both 12-month and 18-month performance. It began 1987 with a 47% allocation for stocks, but gradually cut that back to a mere 6% in late September, following the dictates of its mathematical model.    So far in 1988, PaineWebber has trailed most competitors. But Ed Kerschner, the firm's chief investment strategist, says he's not concerned. &quot;We had lousy six-month numbers before Oct. 19,&quot; he says. &quot;Especially before a top in any market, we're going to look pretty stupid. And also before a bottom -- we're going to be buying a market a little too soon.&quot;    Right now, Mr. Kerschner thinks the stock market is near a top. &quot;The winning market (in stocks) has gone about as far as it can go, given the current level of (interest) rates,&quot; he says. He recommends only a 21% holding in stocks.    Mr. Kerschner prefers bonds, but rising interest rates can hurt them, too. In early July, he reduced the recommended bond allocation to 59% from 68%, and raised the recommended cash position to 20%.    A.G. EDWARDS: Staying consistently cautious, A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. has served up only small helpings of stocks in its recommended blend. That helped Edwards's performance around the crash, but hurt it otherwise. Thus, the St. Louis-based firm was second in the 12-month tally, but last in the latest six months.    Raymond Worseck, Edwards's chief economist and chief market strategist, turns up his nose at the low dividend yield offered by most stocks and expects the economy to slow. Thus, he says, &quot;I have to go with bonds&quot; over stocks. He also thinks investors should keep about 25% of their money in cash equivalents, in case -- as he fears -- interest rates keep rising.    SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON: The American Express Co. unit did consistently well, finishing among the top three firms for each time period.    Unlike several competitors, Shearson Lehman Hutton strategist Michael Sherman doesn't think rising interest rates pose a &quot;mortal threat&quot; to the stock and bond markets. It's mainly short-term rates that have been rising, he says, and he thinks they may be lower by year's end. Thus, Shearson's recommended blend, with 60% stocks and only 5% cash, is now &quot;pretty much at my normal level,&quot; Mr. Sherman says.    MERRILL LYNCH, SMITH BARNEY and DEAN WITTER: All three firms were around the middle of the pack in all three periods.    William Helman, director of economic and investment policy at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., says, &quot;I guess we were affected psychologically as much as anybody else by the severity of the decline in 1987. With hindsight, one would have been fully invested in equities in the recent six months. But one never has hindsight.&quot;    Charles Clough, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., thinks &quot;inflation concerns are a bit overdone,&quot; and suggests that investors may want to begin buying some longer-term bonds.    At Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., a unit of Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., chief investment strategist John Connolly recommends more stocks than bonds but is getting edgy as interest rates rise. &quot;Bond rates are beginning to present a challenge to the equity market,&quot; he says.    DREXEL BURNHAM: After neglecting to duck before the crash, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. did well in the latest six months, adroitly zigzagging on bonds while keeping a substantial position in stocks.    The day after the crash, Drexel Burnham increased its recommended bond position to 32%, and thus caught a brisk bond rally that started because of fears of a recession. By February, says Abby Joseph Cohen, investment policy analyst, &quot;many investors were thinking in terms of a recession. Our feeling was that there was not going to be (one) and that credit demands would be stronger than most people thought.&quot; So the firm cut back on bonds to 25%, just in time to mitigate the damage from a weak bond market in the spring.    KIDDER PEABODY: The General Electric Co. unit ranked in the bottom half for all three time periods. Like A.G. Edwards, only more so, Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. has been playing it safe. Joseph Fuchs, director of research, says the firm's &quot;risk-averse&quot; stance has stemmed from its &quot;concerns about interest rates, the dollar, the economic outlook and the volatility of financial markets world-wide.&quot; Kidder's huge recommended cash position -- 50% since Feb. 10 -- limits risk but also cuts the chances for any major gains.    THOMSON MCKINNON: Having sometimes zigged when it should have zagged, Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. was the only firm that didn't outperform a typical fixed blend in any of the three periods.    For example, it cut its allocation for stocks to 35% in February, just as stock prices were turning up, then raised the allocation to 60% in April, just as they were turning down. On the bond side, Thomson had light allocations in January and June, when bonds rallied, but raised the allocation in between, when bonds slumped.    Right now, Thomson has cut its bond allocation to just 10%. With the Federal Reserve tightening credit, the drought pushing up commodity prices and factories nearing their capacity limits, &quot;you don't want to have anything to do with long (term) bonds,&quot; says Brian Fabbri, Thomson's chief economist and market strategist.    PRUDENTIAL-BACHE: Perhaps Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. should lay claim to the slogan &quot;bullish on America,&quot; now that Merrill Lynch isn't using it any more. For more than a year, Prudential-Bache investment strategist Greg Smith has recommended a 90% position in stocks, while disdaining bonds. This month he went even further -- recommending 100% stocks, no bonds and no cash for people whose investment guidelines permit a lopsided commitment to one asset.    The results of the firm's extremely bullish posture have been mixed. Prudential-Bache looked bad over the latest 12 months because it led with its chin during the crash. But it topped all firms in the past six months and was among the leaders over 18 months. Mr. Smith, who couldn't be reached for comment, wrote earlier this month that stable or lower oil prices, plus a stronger dollar, mean good times ahead for equities. The &quot;'manana' recession,&quot; he wrote, &quot;keeps getting postponed.&quot;    ---                In Search of the Perfect Blend    The table shows the return of asset-allocation blends recommended by 10 major brokerage houses over 12-month, six-month, and 18-month periods ended June 30, 1988. Also shown is the asset mix each house currently recommends.
