DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former President Reagan says he wonders nowwhether the Iran-Contra affair that rocked his second term in theWhite House wasn't ``a setup, a sting operation, by the Iranians.''   Reagan's latest comment on the most controversial foreign policyinitiative of his eight years in office comes in a new book,``Speaking My Mind,'' published by Simon and Schuster.   The book is a collection of speeches, each preceded by a shortessay containing Reagan's reflection on the subject or the occasion.   One of the speeches is his March 4, 1987, address after therelease of the Tower Commission report on his administration'sdecision to sell arms to Iran while seeking Iranian help for therelease of American hostages.   The commission, appointed by Reagan to look into thecontroversy, said his decision to sell arms to Iran ``rewarded aregime that clearly supported terrorism and hostage-taking.''   Reagan, in his speech, took responsibility for things that had``happened on my watch,'' but also said he ``didn't ask enoughabout the specifics of the total Iran plan.''   He has since said there are many aspects of the affair he stilldoes not understand.   In his new remarks, the former president defended the initiativealthough he said that ``something clearly went wrong with ouroriginal plan.''   ``I'm going to cover this more completely in my memoirs,'' hewrote, ``but I get beside myself when I think that people believe Iwould actually trade arms for hostages.''   ``I did not see it as trading arms for hostages because we weredealing with Iranian intermediaries, not the kidnappersthemselves,'' said Reagan. ``I know it may be a fine line to mostpeople, but it's what I believed then and what I still believe.''   ``I have to say that in looking back I wonder if this wholething wasn't a setup, a sting operation, by the Iranians,'' saidthe former president. ``Maybe we were conned into believing thesewere moderate Iranians seeking to reach out to the West, while inreality they were working directly for the Ayatollah just to getsome arms. Who knows?''   The episode became known as the Iran-Contra affair because someof the sale proceeds were diverted to the Contra rebels inNicaragua, whose fight against the country's leftist regime wasstrongly backed by Reagan.   Elsewhere in his book, Reagan writes that Nicaragua's Sandinistagovernment ``completely bamboozled many on Capitol Hill'' and adds,``I also honestly believe that the Sandinistas hoodwinked many inthe American press.''   On another subject, Reagan says that even his wife, Nancy, wasagainst his going ahead with a planned visit to a cemetery atBitburg, West Germany, despite the controversy that arose because48 Nazi storm troopers were buried there. He says he decided to goanyway because ``I didn't feel that we could ask new generations ofGermans to live with this guilt forever without any hope ofredemption.''   In the prologue to the March 8, 1983, speech in which Reagandenounced the Soviet Union as an ``evil empire,'' he writes thatthe characterization was apt at the time, but ``I could not in goodconscience today call the Soviet Union an evil empire.''   Of his speech before departing for his first meeting with Sovietleader Mikhail Gorbachev in Geneva in 1985, he says, ``I did notknow when I left for that meeting in Geneva, I would eventuallycall Mikhail Gorbachev a friend.''</TEXT></DOC>
