Transit supporters fear a vote by five suburbs to withdraw fromDallas Area Rapid Transit bus service will derail a $2.45 billionplan to construct 66 miles of rail lines by 2010. The plan alsocalls for an 18-mile rail link connecting downtown to theDallas-Fort Worth International Airport and 37 miles of bus and carpool lanes for suburban commuters.   ``If this plan fails, it's going to set Dallas back 10 to 15years,'' said DART board member Charles Clack.   The transit authority approved the rail plan in June after sixyears of delays.   Critics in the suburbs of Irving, Plano, Carrollton, Rowlett andCoppell say the authority has taken too long already and that theirbus service is not commensurate with the tax dollars theycontribute to DART. They say widening roads and adding tollwayswould be cheaper than a rail system.   ``There is a great mistrust of DART,'' said Pat Cotton, who hasworked against the rail plan. ``People feel there have beenexpenditures that have not been wise.''   ``Of course, we've always had our own cars and we like to driveup to our own spots. That kind of philosophy has been in place inTexas for years,'' Clack said.   But that philosophy creates rush-hour gridlock on Dallasfreeways.   Of more than 974,000 area residents, about 150,000 ride DARTbuses daily. DART estimates 214,000 riders will use the transitsystem once it is complete.   DART spokesman Ron Whittington fears even more congestedfreeways if suburban bus service ends. ``You're going to put about20,000 more drivers back on the roads,'' he said. ``That's scary.''   In 1983, voters approved a 1-cent sales tax to finance a $5.5billion regional bus and rail network. A sagging economy forced theauthority to scale back plans and ask voters last year to approvethe issue of $1 billion in bonds to start rail construction. Votersin the 16 cities served by DART said no.   Now DART officials see the Aug. 12 suburban referendums ascrucial for the area's growth.   ``This is not a vote on DART, it's a vote on regionaltransportation,'' said board member Jim Jenne of Carrollton. Hebelieves corporations won't move to Dallas unless they're assuredof regional transit.   ``Maybe we can get by without mass transit for a couple ofyears,'' Clack said. ``But a little down the line, we're going toneed one. You can't just snap your fingers and have it appear. Youhave to start now.''</TEXT></DOC>
