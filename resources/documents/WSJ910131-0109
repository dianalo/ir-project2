He had to state war aims, keepthe country united and assert leadership that would lay thebasis for a domestic agenda after the Persian Gulf isdecided. For a President who is not known as the greatcommunicator, Mr. Bush came through loud and clear.   One important insight into how Mr. Bush views the war inthe Gulf is that he repeatedly invoked World War II, neverVietnam or Grenada. The war against Saddam, he said, is&quot;another defining hour for America and for the world.&quot; Onceagain, the &quot;burdens and sacrifices&quot; of leadership fall to theUnited States -- not because we asked for the duty or becausewe glorify war, Mr. Bush said, but because it is still truethat among all countries only we have &quot;both the moralstanding and the means to back it up.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Bush also took this opportunity to make what we see asa subtle but important escalation in the aims of the war.&quot;What is at stake is more than one small country,&quot; he said.Yes, Kuwait must be liberated, but now that battle hasrevealed clearly the nature of the enemy, this is no longerenough. He said regional stability will require an Iraq &quot;thatuses its great resources not to destroy, not to serve theambitions of a tyrant, but to build a better life for itselfand its neighbors.&quot; This new Iraq can emerge only afterSaddam. For that matter, this new Iraq can come only afterthe passing of the Ba'ath socialist party.   Mr. Bush echoed a Wilsonian spreading of democracy, withAmericans destined to have &quot;a unique responsibility to do thehard work of freedom.&quot; There is truth to this sentiment.However, we would have liked to see more about the oilweapon, which Saddam craves, as one measure of how we willlimit our world policeman role to vital interests.   Despite fears of an appeasing silence, the word &quot;Baltics&quot;got mentioned. Mr. Bush said &quot;our objective is to help theBaltic peoples achieve their aspirations,&quot; which are obvious.He also said, &quot;If it is possible, I want to continue to builda lasting basis for U.S.-Soviet cooperation.&quot; This may nolonger be possible. The White House yesterday said theSoviets gave the vague assurance that they would remove fromthe Baltics &quot;all troops that were in excess of thosegarrisoned there.&quot; Will the thuggish Black Berets remain?   Mr. Bush sounded at least two Reaganesque themes. &quot;Ifanyone tells you that America's best days are behind her,&quot; hesaid, &quot;they're looking the wrong way.&quot; Mr. Bush also remindedthe country of the familiar refrain that since 1981, thecountry created 20 million new jobs and cut inflation andinterest rates in half. Economic growth has only been&quot;temporarily interrupted,&quot; Mr. Bush said. He called on banksto make more loans, though he knows the heavy hand offinancial regulators has a crunching grip on the economy.   Mr. Bush signaled how he plans to approach domesticdisputes for the duration of the war. His daring and possiblyinspired strategy is to act as if the bipartisanship heforged on the Gulf extends at home as well.   He said any opposition to a cut in capital gains can beresolved by studying the economics, as if the Democrats hadno political animus toward a Bush campaign pledge. He askedFed Chairman Alan Greenspan to meet with congressionalleaders to &quot;sort out our technical differences so that we canavoid a return to unproductive partisan bickering.&quot; Mr.Greenspan's position is that &quot;I've always been supportive oflowering the capital-gains tax or preferably eliminating it.&quot;Rather predictably, House Speaker Tom Foley yesterday saidthe idea is dead on arrival.   We're not sure what to make of Mr. Bush's embrace ofabolishing PACs, while apparently backing away from settingterm limits for members of Congress. Combining term limitswith changes in financing campaigns might work, but withoutPACs we'd still have the incumbency protection rackets offranking and gerrymandering. Mr. Bush might have in mindfreeing individual contributions, which would be a bigimprovement over the current system of special interests atthe trough.   The &quot;empowerment&quot; theme got more attention than the youngconservatives in the White House probably would havepredicted. This is because the new ideas Mr. Bush mentioned,such as school vouchers and tenant ownership of publichousing, are based on the traditional conservative idea oflimited government. Mr. Bush also emphasized that thedefinition of civil rights must include freedom from crime.Enforcing domestic tranquility was an original promise ofcivil liberty.   After masterful leadership abroad to array the worldagainst Saddam, Mr. Bush has now asserted himself at home.This leadership can extend after the Gulf is decided. In asense, the medium is the message. The most importantinformation Mr. Bush gave about the State of the Union isthat the presidency is so clearly able to offer strongleadership through difficult times.</TEXT></DOC>
