Judge Barefoot Sanders issued the opinion as part of the continuing litigation between the Bank Board and Jarrett E. Woods Jr., the former chairman of Western Savings. The Bank Board last September declared the Dallas thrift insolvent, citing &quot;speculative lending,&quot; including &quot;deficient or nonexistent (real estate) appraisals, inadequate loan documents, inaccurate accounting and shoddy record keeping.&quot;    Mr. Woods contested the closing, maintaining the thrift was in sound financial health, and last September filed a lawsuit against the Bank Board and its Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp. arm in U.S. district court here. Mr. Woods couldn't be reached for comment, but Brett Ringle, a lawyer representing Mr. Woods, said he will appeal the judge's opinion to the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans when the opinion is entered in the case as a judgment.    Bank Board officials said they hadn't seen the court decision and thus couldn't comment on it.    In the opinion, Judge Sanders wrote that the Bank Board's &quot;decision to appoint a receiver for Western had a reasoned basis, considered all the relevant factors, and was not arbitrary or capricious.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
