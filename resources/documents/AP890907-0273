Both sides reported the talks were constructive, but neitherindicated any moves to settle their disputes over Europeanagricultural subsidies and a European ban on imports ofhormone-treated beef from the United States.   Even so, Yeutter told reporters he was ``mildly encouraged'' thatthe current round of international trade negotiations could bewrapped up on schedule, by the end of 1990. Those talks, called theUruguay Round, are being held under the auspices of the 96-nationGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.   Earlier, Ray MacSharry, the top agricultural official for theEuropean Community, raised the possibility that the two sides'dispute over the trading bloc's ban on beef from cattle treated withgrowth hormones might be easing.   The United States has refused to comply with the prohibition,arguing the hormones used by its farmers are safe. It has retaliatedwith stiff duties on some European imports.   MacSharry said more than 200 feedlots in the United States andabout 10 slaughterhouses have been approved to ship hormone-freebeef to the 12 nations of the community. A major packing companyalso has shown in interest in gaining approval for its products, hesaid.   The recent shipments of hormone-free beef would amount to about$9 million if stretched out over 12 months, according to communityestimates.   As a result, MacSharry said he expected an easing of the U.S.sanctions shortly.   Yeutter, however, described the recent shipments of high-qualitybeef as nominal and said they did not include the lower grades whichmake up about 80 percent or 85 percent of the disputed meat sent tothe community.   ``We've still only solved about 15 percent of the problem,'' hesaid.   Yeutter also said governments should wait for the results ofscientific studies on another hormone, bovine somatatropin or BST,before deciding whether to ban its use. BST boosts the milk yield ofa cow.   MacSharry has proposed that the community hold off making adecision on the hormone until the end of 1990.   The United States, the European Community and other nations aretackling agricultural policies as part of the Uruguay Round talks.   A sticking point has been an American demand for the community toget rid of import barriers and export and domestic farm subsidiesthat it says distort trade.   To do that, the United States has suggested to GATT that steps betaken to convert subsidies or other trade barriers into tariffs sothat these duties could then be negotiated to lower levels. The ideais to quantify the restrictions in order to reduce them.   MacSharry said that plan was ``of major concern to us.''   If such action were taken to reduce support for European farmers,he said, the community would have to look at ways of slappingtariffs on ``an enormous amount'' of products that now enter thetrading bloc duty free.   Yeutter, in turn, said the United States was ``vigorouslyopposed'' to those tariff adjustments, known as ``rebalancing.''   ``What is proposed by the community constitutes increasedprotectionism rather than icreased trade liberalization,'' he said.   Yeutter was scheduled to travel to Switzerland and Germany beforereturning to the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
