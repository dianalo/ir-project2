(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tobacco is still a titan in many of the 14Southern and border states that will hold presidential primariesMarch 8. But some say it's no longer political suicide in thetobacco belt to talk about health risks of smoking or to voiceopposition to government subsidies of the industry.   Testing that theory in recent weeks, two Southerners hoping forstrong presidential showings in the region _ Republican PatRobertson and Democrat Albert Gore Jr. _ have raised eyebrows withstatements about tobacco that might have doomed them in pastcampaigns.   In an article in Conservative Digest, Robertson proposed a10-year phaseout of the domestic tobacco industry, which employs710,000 people and generates $14.1 billion per year in wages andbenefits.   Robertson called for federal assistance to cushion the blow forfarmers and cigarette manufacturers.   Gore's statements were less provocative. During a mid-Januarydebate in Iowa, he said he opposed federal subsidies of tobacco andsupported federal anti-smoking programs targeted at young people.   Rep. Charles Rose, a North Carolina Democrat who is chairman ofthe House subcommittee on tobacco and peanuts, says the industrystill wields enormous clout.   ``It's a very silent but powerful force in Southern politics,''Rose said.   But Jim Van Hecke, North Carolina Democratic chairman, saidgrowers were more outspoken in past decades because there was lessscientific evidence of the dangers of smoking. Also, the growth ofSouthern cities and the arrival of workers and industries fromother areas have made the region's economy more diverse.   It has become routine for presidential candidates venturing intoNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee andGeorgia to face questions about their stands on the federal tobaccoprogram and the government's war on smoking. Few had openly defiedthe tobacco industry until this year.   Robertson's industry-phaseout plan was widely condemned intobacco circles.   ``Ludicrous and asinine,'' said Joe King, a grower and presidentof the 300-member South Carolina Tobacco Association.   However, Earl Black, political science professor at theUniversity of South Carolina, said, ``Robertson's getting somecriticism but he's also getting some praise for having the courageto take on an issue like this.''   In Robertson's home state of Virginia, the impact has been hardto gauge, said Steve Haner, executive director of the state'sRepublican Legislative Caucus.   ``You go down to southside Virginia where they grow the stuffand it's fatal to talk like that,'' Haner said. But he also saidRobertson had ``a committed cadre of followers'' who would notdesert him because of his stand on tobacco.   Robertson himself sounded unconcerned. ``I'm not about to loseany votes on this,'' the former television evangelist said inColumbia, S.C. ``I'm on the side of the angels on this one.''   Gore, a U.S. senator from Tennessee, said he opposed subsidies``in spite of the fact that there are 100,000 tobacco farmers in myhome state.'' The federal tobacco program is financed through feespaid by the growers, not direct government payments.   Many of this year's presidential hopefuls have tried to pleasethe tobacco industry as well as increasingly assertive non-smokersby separating the health and economic issues.   ``You can be against smoking cigarettes without being againstfamily farmers who grow tobacco,'' Jesse Jackson said recently.   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis told an audience in Wilson,N.C., that he had ``no problem'' with the existing tobacco program,but he urged farmers to grow other crops as well.   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri is an enthusiastic supporterof the tobacco program. ``It encourages an orderly market fortobacco. We're going to have tobacco and tobacco products inAmerica and it's just a matter of where it's grown.''   On the Republican side, Rep. Jack Kemp said he would continuesupport programs for tobacco and other commodities where necessarybut preferred the free-market system.</TEXT></DOC>
