(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It was front-page news when the managingeditor of the Key West Citizen annouced he was retiring aftertesting positive for AIDS.   Jim Tucci, who started 12 years ago as a reporter at the localdaily newspaper, is one of the more visible AIDS stories to hit thissunny tourist mecca, but Key West, famed for a relaxed, relativelycarefree lifestyle, is coping with one of the nation's highest AIDSrates.   Despite signs that a spiraling number of AIDS cases has taken aheavy toll on health service providers, longtime residents saybigger, richer cities could probably learn something from thiscommunity's attitude toward victims.   ``I think this town is a lot further ahead than others,'' saidGordon Ross Bondesen, a gay entertainer at a popular resort hotelwho has lived here nearly 20 years. ``There's a lot of education andsupport'' and compassion, he said.   However, concerns raised in published reports on the prevalenceof AIDS and on its potential impact on the tourism industry angercommunity leaders.   ``My only concern is the way it's reported, not that it's here,''said Don Defeo, president of the Key West Hotel-Motel Association.   ``There's a lot of competition out for the tourist dollar,'' saidChamber of Commerce President John Parks Jr. ``We're more concernedabout the hurricane situation.''   Yet acquired immune deficiency syndrome has had a much moredramatic effect on the people of Key West this decade than anyhurricane.   Just 243 cases have been recorded since 1982 by the Monroe CountyPublic Health Unit, which covers all of the Florida Keys, populationabout 77,000. But the rate of 121 cases per 100,000 people puts KeyWest (population 27,000), in the company of such cities as SanFrancisco (104 cases per 100,000), New York (70 per 100,000) andMiami (47 per 100,000). Key West has most of the cases.   ``In a little town like this, that much AIDS is relatively alot,'' said Dave Nolan, the health unit's statistician.   One reason for the high rate is a large gay population, which hasa higher incidence of AIDS. Some victims diagnosed elsewhere alsomove here, raising concern about limited resources being strained.   ``I think anyone can understand our concern, that people who'vecontracted AIDS elsewhere and are looking for a sympatheticcommunity will think of Key West, but there is a point where thecommunity will be stretched to the limit,'' said Mayor RichardHeyman.   However, the greater concern for the future is new cases arisingfrom drug abuse, Nolan said. ``Like everybody else in the country,we have drug problems, and where there are drugs, AIDS follows.''   How prepared Key West is to handle a surge in new cases isuncertain, but one doctor who sees most of the AIDS patients at hisprivate practice with two other physicians says the island isn'tready.   ``The health-care resources are not in place in this community,as they are not in other cities,'' said Dr. Larry Siegel. ``Thiscommunity is not yet prepared to deal with large numbers of newpatients.''   The spiraling costs for AIDS-related medical care already havehad a dramatic impact at Florida Keys Memorial Hospital, thecounty's only public hospital. During the last fiscal year, itabsorbed $1 million in unpaid bills left by AIDS patients,accounting for about one-third of its bad debt. That figure was upsharply from the previous year, hospital administrator Donald Mayersaid.   One AIDS patient who died recently left a $150,000 bill for a45-day stay, Mayer said. Lee Brooks was diagnosed HIV-positive inMiami in 1981 and moved to Key West five years ago to run a guesthouse. The 36-year-old man died in March without medical insuranceafter spending the last nine months of his life at the hospital,according to a published report.   Lack of state and federal dollars is a key problem, said Heyman,adding that Key West's size puts it at a disadvantage in competingfor financing with cities like Miami. ``We're having to do more onless,'' he said.   Much of the burden for helping AIDS patients with basic needs hasfallen on local groups, such as AIDS Help, which help with rent,food and medication.   The focus also has been put on education, with monthly safe-sexworkshops, brochures and condoms distributed at gay bars, and freecondoms provided at guest houses, among other programs.   A mobile testing van, believed to be the first in the state, willsoon hit the streets to provide safe-sex education and conduct AIDStests, said Norene Sofranac, director of the AIDS Prevention Center,which is run by the state Department of Health and RehabilitativeServices.   Bondesen, who has lost 30 friends to AIDS, said the epidemic hasmade the gay community more sexually responsible and resulted in asolid support network for AIDS victims. ``There isn't a sense ofgloom but more a sense of determination'' to educate people aboutAIDS, he said.   Tony Tarracino, 73, a saloon operator in the Old Town section,said Key West is a survivor and will carry on as usual, despite whatis perceived as negative media coverage of AIDS here.   ``We always seem to overcome,'' said Tarracino, who was electedmayor on Nov. 7.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday AMs, Nov. 13</NOTE></DOC>
