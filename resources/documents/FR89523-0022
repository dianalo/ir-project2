The proposed amendmentwould eliminate the inadequate optional on-wing ultrasonic inspection oftenth stage compressor disks, and add an engine model inadvertently omittedin the previous amendment. The proposed AD is needed to prevent uncontainedruptures of tenth stage compressor disks due to undetected fatigue cracksoriginating at the tierod holes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES:</T2> Comments must be received on or before July 31, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES:</T2> Comments on the proposal may be mailed in duplicateto: Federal Aviation Administration, New England Region, Office of theAssistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 81-ANE-03, 12 NewEngland Executive Park, Burlington, Massachusetts 01803; or delivered induplicate to Room 311, at the above address.

Communications should identify the regulatory docket number and be submittedin duplicate to the address specified above. All communications receivedon or before the closing date for comments will be considered by the FAAbefore taking action on the proposed rule. The proposal contained in thisnotice may be changed in light of comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic,environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submittedwill be available, both before and after the closing date for comments,in the Rules Docket, at the address given above, for examination by interestedpersons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact, concerned with thesubstance of the proposed AD, will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submittedin response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcardon which the following statement is made: Comments to Docket No. 81-ANE-03.The postcard will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter. AD 81-08-02 R2, Amendment 39-4083 as amended by Amendment 39-4432 as furtheramended by Amendment 39-4817 (49 FR 7361; February 29, 1984), requiresinspections at the tierod holes of stages 9 through 12 HPC disks. AD 81-08-02R2 also allows for an on-wing ultrasonic inspection of tenth stage disks.The intent of developing the on-wing tenth stage disk inspection procedurewas to provide an alternative inspection method for operator schedulingflexibility. Since issuing AD 81-08-02 R2, an incident has occurred resulting in anuncontained fracture of a tenth stage compressor disk. The disk had beensubjected to three previous on-wing ultrasonic inspections prior to fracture.The FAA has determined that AD 81-08-02 R2 should be amended to removethe on-wing ultrasonic inspection of tenth stage compressor disks. Thismethod has been determined as inadequate for detecting tierod hole cracking.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop in other engines ofthe same type design, the proposed AD would amend AD 81-08-02 R2, Amendment39-4817 (49 FR 7361; February 29, 1984) and require only uninstalled inspectionsof stages 9 through 12 HPC disks on certain PW JT8D engines in accordancewith PW ASB 4723, Revision 11, dated October 30, 1987.The proposed amendment also adds the JT8D-7A engine model to the compliancesection where it was inadvertently omitted from the original amendment.The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongvarious levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalismimplications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation involves few enginesand will have negligible economic impact since most operators use uninstalledtenth stage disk inspections. It has also been determined that few, ifany, small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Actwill be affected since the proposed rule affects only operators using aircraftin which JT8D engines are installed, none of which are believed to be smallentities. Therefore, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``major rule''under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOTRegulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); (3)does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipatedimpact is so minimal; and (4) if promulgated, will not have a significanteconomic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of smallentities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 </ITAG>Engines, Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, and Incorporationby reference. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes to amend Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
