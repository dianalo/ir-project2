In yourMay 21 editorial &quot;General Aspin's Pork Army&quot; you repeat thesame tired Pentagon arguments that have been refuted by V-22supporters again and again.   You swallowed whole the Pentagon's arguments that the V-22is a pork project. Acutally, it's more cost-effective thanany medium-lift Marine aircraft. While it is true that thePentagon has tried to kill the Osprey for three years'running, it is seldom mentioned that the Defense Departmenthas proposed a rather costly alternative: retrofittinghundreds of antiquated helicopters in an entirely newconfiguration to meet the Marines' medium-lift requirements.The price tag: $24 billion.</LP><TEXT>   Last year, the Pentagon commissioned a study by theInstitute for Defense Analysis that compared all the proposedmedium-lift alternatives, and specifically compared the V-22and the Pentagon alternative, as well as other potentialproposals. The study used $24 billion (for which you canbuild 356 Ospreys) as a budgeting bench mark, and examined 12separate military missions. Its conclusions: &quot;The V22'sspeed, range and survivability advantages enable even the356-aircraft fleet to be more effective than all of theproposed alternatives.&quot; The V-22's unique tilt-rotor design(which allows it to take off like a helicopter and fly like afixed-wing aircraft) gives it advantages no helicopter in thefleet can match.   It is no mystery why the V-22 has widespread support onCapitol Hill -- members know that killing the V-22 would notsave money. We would simply spend huge sums of money onoutdated Vietnam-era helicopters. The V-22's technologicalbreakthrough is the reason it won the prestigious CollierTrophy this year, the highest award given in the field ofaerospace aviation.   Let history provide a reminder. During the early 1970s thePentagon annually opposed the AV-8B Harrier close-supportjet. Every year, Congress took the initiative and funded theprogram. In Operation Desert Storm, the Harrier was theprimary jet used to provide close air support for our Marineson the ground. Our Marines, you may recall, did rather well.   Accusing members of Congress of &quot;selling&quot; their vote (asyou accused me of doing in your editorial) does nothing toadvance the debate on defense spending. A Republican shouldbe allowed to differ with the Pentagon on defense prioritieswithout being accused of selling out.   Rep. Curt Weldon (R., Pa.)   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
