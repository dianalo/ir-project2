ROSENFELD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ANKENY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After raising millions of insects to feaston corn plants in test fields this summer, researchers aresurveying the damage for genetic clues to fight the $400 millionpests.   Using the same techniques that enable law enforcement agenciesto identify the ``genetic fingerprints'' of criminals, they aretrying to pinpoint pest-resistant genes on corn chromosomes.   The aim not only is to breed corn that resists infestation bythe European corn borer, but also to use the findings to protectcorn and other crops from a wide range of pests and diseases, saysMichael Lee, an assistant professor of agronomy at Iowa StateUniversity.   ``You end up with an agricultural system less dependent onchemical control of insects,'' Lee says. ``A more stableagricultural system.''   If scientists can map the location of genes for traits such aspest resistance, they can tackle more complex genetic traits, suchas those that could increase crop yields with less reliance onchemical fertilizers, he says.   Lee is working in cooperation with academic and governmentscientists at the Corn Insects Research Unit of the U.S. Departmentof Agriculture at Ankeny, a community between Des Moines and Ames,where Iowa State is located.   He has a $160,000 grant for a four-year genetic study. The USDAcontributed about $10,000 of its $477,000 budget from the cornresearch unit this year to produce the insects, place them on tensof thousands of plants and record data, according to theAgricultural Research Service.   At laboratories in the midst of corn fields, about 3 million eggmasses of 25 corn borer eggs each were produced this year and keptin Mason jars. The larvae were raised in a mixture of ground corngrits and later placed in plastic dispensers that released them inbatches of 60.   Typically, 240 larvae are placed on a corn plant, but in somecases as many as 900 of the pests are let loose on one plant. Thereare six to 10 plants in each of the more than 14,000 test plots inAnkeny and Ames.   ``Nothing escapes infestation,'' says Bud Guthrie, researchleader at the Ankeny corn insects research unit.   But researchers say there is no threat that a feeding frenzy ofinsects will be unleashed on farmers' fields from the test plots.   The larvae cannot survive if they fall off the plant, Lee said.   ``They stay where you put them. They never reach adult stage,''he says.   Adult moths do not damage corn, but lay eggs in fields thathatch and can decimate crops.   The corn borer causes damage when the first generation of larvaeeats corn leaves and the second generation eats the protectivesheath around the stalk at the time of pollination, burrowing intothe plant. The damage weakens the plants and causes them to topplebefore the corn can be harvested.   First found in this country in 1917, the European corn borer wasa seemingly unbeatable scourge. In the 1930s, entire fields werelaid waste.   Guthrie estimates that in Iowa fields this past summer, wherecorn typically is sown 25,000 plants to an acre, there was oneborer for every other plant. That's down from an average of eight aplant 40 years ago, when fields were not so thick with corn.   Development of hybrid corn strains and spraying has helpedreduce the devastation, but it still costs U.S. farmers $400million a year in losses and control efforts, the USDA says. InIowa, the leading corn producing state, the corn borer costsfarmers about $100 million a year.   This summer, in test plots near the laboratory, corn withbrittle stalks and leaves that looked like they'd been raked byshotgun fire stood beside plants that would have been at home inany healthy field.   Even the highly susceptible plants look good compared withpictures of the crop devastation of the 1930s.   ``Compared with the old times, the entire acreage isresistant,'' Guthrie says.   This fall, researchers are splitting each plant by hand,measuring the tunnels produced by the insects.   Scientists already have identified eight corn genes that resistleaf feeding by the first generation of larvae and seven genes thatcondition the corn plant to resist the second generation. Whilethose genes are not on the same chromosome, says Guthrie,scientists know which of the 10 pairs of chromosome arms areinvolved with those genes.   The problem is, each arm contains tens of thousands of genes.   Using X-ray film and small amounts of radioactivity, thescientists are looking at DNA samples from each of the plants todetect genetic differences between the corn that resists borers andis susceptible to the pests.   DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the basic building block oflife. It contains the genetic code and transmits the hereditarypattern for reproduction.   A technique, known as restriction fragment length polymorphism,is used to detect differences in the DNA sequence among corn plants.   ``This is exactly the same technique as genetic fingerprinting.What they're trying to do with the prison population, we're tryingto do with plants,'' says Lee.   Once the genes are mapped, the information can be used inselection programs for the development of corn. Seed companiescould use the information to develop new hybrids, a process thattakes about five years.   ``The first thing we hope to establish is a more preciselocation of the genes,'' Lee says. ``We'll know the location of thesome of the genes next summer.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Monday Oct. 16</NOTE></DOC>
