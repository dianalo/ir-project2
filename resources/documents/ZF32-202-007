(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The competition among communications programs may seem more like a skirmishthan a war to those who follow software struggles, but it's a battle wherethe users ultimately come out as winners.andP;  Hayes has fired the most recentsalvo with the release of SmartCom Exec, Version 2.0.andM;Exec adds network support to a program that was already very sophisticated,yet easy to use.andP;  And there's no increase in SmartCom Exec's list price of$129.andP;  Free upgrades are available to registered owners of Version  1.0.andM;To truly support networking, a communications program must support the API ofthe communications server.andP;  Higher-end packages such as SmartCom III andXtalk Mk4 both support networking, but Exec is one of the few &quot;easy-to-use&quot;packages with this support.andP;  With Version 2.0, both stand-alone and networkedpersonal computers have access to a list of features that include: TTY, VT102, and ANSI.SYS terminal emulation, support for Xmodem, Ymodem, Zmodem, andKermit file-transfer protocols, keyboard macros, and a powerful scriptlanguage.andM;Because the new version supports the NCSI/NASI interface and variations ofthe INT 14 interface, Exec is now compatible with communications servers likeNovell's NACS, Network Products' [ACS.sub.2andrsqb; and NMP, Jandamp;L's NCS, and 3Com'sCommunications Server.andP;  The package allows modem sharing and, through a BIOSprinting option, printer sharing.andM;The package ships on three 5.25-inch disks or two 3.5-inch disks, andincludes three small manuals: a general user guide, a SCOPE TechnicalReference, and, new to Version 2.0, a network user guide.andP;  The new 24-pagenetwork guide has clear directions for installing Exec either on individualPCs, or on a file server, as well as API-specific notes on making the networkconnection, and some tips for administrators.andP;  The manuals are not rich intechnical detail, but they are well organized and have most of the necessaryinformation.andM;The phone book metaphor, which has become a standard for communicationsprograms, is part of Exec.andP;  (The phone book combines the Activity andConnection settings found in Smart-Com III, Hayes's higher-end communicationssoftware product.) The user interface consists of menus, tables, settingsscreens, and dialog boxes, which can all be manipulated from the keyboardand/or with a mouse.andP;  Extensive, context-sensitive help is available.andM;Though Exec is easy to use, it's far from unsophisticated.andP;  Exec is one of ahandful of programs, including Crosstalk Communicator, Qmodem, and Telix,that take full advantage of the newest buffered 16550A UART from NationalSemiconductor.andP;  The software will automatically detect and take advantage ofa UART which may be found on a system board, in an internal modem, or in aproduct such as Hayes ESP Enhanced Serial Port (reviewed in First Looks,December 25, 1990).andP;  If a 16550A is detected, a 16-byte FIFO buffer isactivated to insure no data is lost during high-speed data transmission.andM;Exec will also support IRQ sharing when the system permits.andP;  (At present,only PS/2s with an MCA bus take advantage of IRQ sharing.) The program is thefirst to fully support the Hayes Enhanced Serial Interface as implemented inthe Hayes Enhanced Serial Port.andP;  This enables high-speed (above 9,600 bps)data transmission, without losing data, even on slow machines, or inmultitasking environments.andM;In addition, Exec features a fully integrated text editor, and a powerfulperuse buffer that can hold an ASCII capture of everything that scrolls byyour screen during a communications session.andP;  You can enter the peruse bufferat any time during a session, edit the contents, print or write a portion orall of the contents, and even do string searches on the contents.andP;  Finally,you can easily create keyboard macros; Exec will even allow you to assign ascript to run as a macro.andM;Exec ships with Hayes' Simple Communications Programming Environment (SCOPE),a powerful scripting language that includes all of the script statements youneed to customize the environment, manipulate the user interface, and controlremote and local file operations.andP;  SCOPE is borrowed and abbreviated fromSmart-Com III; the Exec version only eliminates a few statements.andP;  SCOPEscripts written in Exec can be used in SmartCom III; SmartCom III scripts canbe translated and then used in Exec.andP;  There are five enhanced Exec scriptstatements that take advantage of networking features new to Version 2.O.andM;The program's unique &quot;trigger&quot; statement allows event-driven programming,although traditional &quot;wait for&quot; statements that anticipate actions are alsoincluded in the language.andP;  Most popular script dialects have no &quot;trigger&quot;equivalent.andM;Exec has two major shortcomings, and both can be fixed with a simple phonecall.andP;  First, the program does not ship with CompuServe B file-transfersupport.andP;  Second, it doesn't include friendly sample scripts to automateaccess to popular electronic services, like CompuServe and GEnie.andO;Fortunately, these scripts can be easily downloaded from the Hayes Online BBS(800-US-HAYES if you are a registered user).andP;  Customer support is alsoavailable on the BBS, as well as on CompuServe, or by phone.andM;While Exec is designed to be palatable to beginners, its rich feature setmake it an attractive program for intermediate and advanced users, too.andP;  Itssupport for networking and the 16550A UART give it a technological edge overother easy-to-use communications programs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
