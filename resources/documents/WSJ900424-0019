Demonstrators attempted to block the path ofexchange employees heading to work. But police closed off asection of Wall Street to all traffic and pedestrians exceptthose who work on the block.   One demonstrator carried a giant makeshift hypodermicneedle marked &quot;Fossil Fuel Junkies.&quot; Another was dressed in awhite zippered suit on which had been written the names ofvarious chemicals and elements such as toluene, CFC, orchlorofluorocarbons, and mercury.
