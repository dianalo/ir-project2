One twister smashed into the Florida Panhandle town of East Pointearly Thursday night, destroying several homes. A mother, herdaughter and grandson were killed in one home, officials said.   The violent weather began developing along the Gulf Coast onWednesday, when a man who sought shelter in a metal-roofed shed nearStapleto, Ala., was killed by lightning.   Tornadoes skipped across several Louisiana parishes earlyThursday.   One twister struck the small town of Grosse Tete, La., about 6a.m. Thursday, destroying at least 25 residences and injuring abouttwo dozen people, in addition to the man and woman killed,authorities said.   ``We can't imagine how more aren't dead,'' Willie Hurdle, amember of the Iberville Parish Police Jury, said of the town of 790people. ``This is devastating. There's about 20 houses that aren'teven here anymore.''   No serious injuries were reported 15 miles away in Baton Rouge,where Fire Chief Ron Spillman said at least four twisters toucheddown 19 times, destroying or damaging almost 70 mobile homes and 25to 30 houses.   Spillman estimated that between 400 and 600 people lived in thedestroyed or damaged residences. A shelter was set up at a highschool for those left homeless.   Pieces of mobile homes were strewn in tree tops in Grosse Tete.About 100 people were evacuated and were put up in emergencyshelters, Hurdle said. The storm left the town without electricity,natural gas, water and most telephone service.   One elderly woman was rescued from the rubble of her home afterrescuers used a power saw to cut through a pile of wood. Dogs weretaken to the area to search for more bodies and trapped survivors.   Gov. Buddy Roemer toured the area by helicopter and Rep. ClydeHolloway, R-La., said he would seek a federal disaster declaration.   Over a two-hour period, tornadoes also were reported in theparishes of West Baton Rouge, St. Helena, Livingston and Tangipahoa.The early morning tornadoes in southeastern Louisiana followed anight of violent weather in the western and central part of thestate in which several homes were destroyed or damaged lateWednesday, but no serious injuries were reported.   A line of thunderstorms that pounded the Florida Panhandleproduced several tornadoes. One ripped through East Point, about 85miles southeast of Tallahassee, at about 7 p.m. EDT.   Three houses and three mobile homes were destroyed and twobusinesses heavily damaged, Franklin County Sheriff's deputies said.The three people killed were a 16-year-old boy, his mother, 33, andhis grandmother, 51.   Other tornadoes destroyed a house, damaged a supermarket andknocked down two temporary buildings. At least 6 inches of rain fellat Milton, the National Weather Service reported.   A U.S. park ranger suffered a broken arm and cuts Thursday when atornado destroyed the entrance station at the Fort Pickens sectionof the Gulf Islands National Seashore on the western FloridaPanhandle. She was thrown 10 to 15 yards and only the concretefoundation of the station was left, officials said.   Another tornado hit Ellisville, Miss., damaging buildings anduprooting trees. Trees and power lines were down across from thecampus of Jones County Community College, where summer classes wereunderway, but officials said there was no campus damage as earlierreported.   Mississippi Power Co. official Dana Hill said most power inEllisville was restored by early afternoon.   Heavy rain was reported in several areas of Mississippi duringthe night, with up to 4 inches on coastal sections.   A half-mile section of U.S. 49 near Brooklyn, Miss., was closedafter water gushed around an overloaded culvert and cut a tunnelunderneath the two-lane roadbed, Highway Department residentengineer Ed Schaub said. The roadbed did not wash out, but a sectionof pavement about 12 feet long cracked and dropped about 18 inches.   Tornadoes touched down in several communities on the Alabamacoast, causing minor injuries and destroying two homes in OrangeBeach, damaging 23 others, and overturning a mobile home inRobertsdale, said Lee Helms of the state Emergency ManagementAgency. More than a dozen mobile homes were damaged in Bay Minette,and a house was damaged in Lillian, near the Florida border,officials said.   At Gulf Shores, Ala., Police Chief Arthur Bourne said the coastalresort experienced ``a little beach erosion, high winds and heavyrain. But mostly we've just hit-and-missed with tornadoes and waterspouts.''   Alabama Power Co. reported that 22,000 customers in the Mobilearea were without power.
