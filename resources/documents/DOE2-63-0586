Ninety-onepatients had a firm clinical diagnosis while 23 were examined withoutknowledge of the clinical diagnosis. Of the 91 patients, 51 were sufferingfrom dementia, 25 multi-infarct type and 26 Alzheimer's disease. In 19of the Alzheimer's patients, a characteristic pattern of decreased perfusionin the parieto-occipital regions was demonstrated while those with multi-infarcttype showed varying degrees of irregular uptake in the cerebral cortex.These appearances are similar to those shown with positron emission tomography(PET) and we believe that HM-PAO will provide a widely available methodfor identifying patients with Alzheimer's disease. Twenty-nine patientswere suffering from diseases involving the basal ganglia. Fifteen patientswith Parkinson's disease showed no significant abnormality in basal gangliauptake, while 7 or 8 patients with Huntington's disease who had fullexaminations showed decreased uptake in the caudate nuclei. Similarly,four of six patients with other basal ganglia diseases showed impaireduptake by basal ganglia, and it is concluded that HM-PAO may be usefulfor the diagnosis and management of this type of patient. Twenty-threepatients received HM-PAO imaging as part of their diagnostic work-up;in 19 of them, detailed follow-up was obtained, which indicated thatin 7 cases the result of the HM-PAO scan altered the clinical diagnosisand in 9 cases resulted in a change in management. In the remaining 13cases, the study was found to be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.</TEXT></DOC>
