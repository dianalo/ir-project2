The claims, by a group of 220 former employees, are part of a $100 million lawsuit against the magazine. The plaintiffs contend that when they retired, they sold their shares back to the then-employee-owned company at prices that were &quot;deliberately undervalued&quot; and designed to discriminate against them. They also charged a group of former U.S. News directors with violations of fiduciary duty in relying on the appraisals.    U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker ruled that the employees didn't produce credible evidence that the company deliberately undervalued the stock or that the directors committed fraud.    The judge also dismissed charges against the appraisal firm hired by the company to value the stock.    Alan Raywid, attorney for the plaintiffs, said the ruling still preserved the claim for full damages. He added that the company and certain of its former directors &quot;still have to defend their conduct&quot; based on obligations under federal employee-retirement laws and the common law. &quot;We're still in there slugging,&quot; he said.    The plaintiffs brought the suit three years ago, after real estate developer and publisher Mortimer B. Zuckerman bought the magazine for $176 million and other U.S. News employees received substantially more for their holdings than the former employees had been paid. </TEXT></DOC>
