In an annual report to the cabinet, Mr. Miyazawa said Japan's governmental and private assets abroad totaled $1.07 trillion at the end of 1987, up 47% from a year earlier, while liabilities surged 51%, to $830.8 billion.    Japan's net holdings abroad surpassed those of Britain and other industrialized nations for the first time in 1985, totaling $129.8 billion.    A Finance Ministry spokesman said last year's sharp increase came from heavy buying of U.S. and other foreign securities by Japanese financial institutions and corporate and private investors. The external assets also include private and government loans and trade credits. </TEXT></DOC>
