They can befine, medical authorities say, to call attention to symptoms, butdiagnosis _ finding the root of the problem _should be left tophysicians.</TEXT><BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When an Italian known to posterity as Sanctoriusinvented the fever thermometer, it was a cumbersome water-baseddevice that didn't find much of a market, but it was the first steptoward the in-home testing kit.   The thermometer made its debut in 1626. A few hundred years andseveral eons of technology later, its descendants are on the way tobecoming a billion-dollar industry in the United States, wherestaying healthy is a leading preoccupation.   Today, from store shelves across the nation, consumers buy kitsto find their most fertile time of the month, check their bloodpressure or blood sugar levels, and screen themselves for possiblecancer of the colon or rectum.   Americans are expected to spend some $616 million this year onhome testing kits. Some forecasters believe the figure will rise tomore than $1 billion a year in the 1990s, driven by newtechnologies, a ``do-it-yourself'' philosophy among consumers, andcost pressures on hospitals and physicians.   But the government has closed the door, at least for now, onhome testing for AIDS. And regulators and medical authorities worryabout any home test that claims to diagnose a particular disease,especially an infectious one, rather than just detect possiblesymptoms.   Since 1977, the Food and Drug Administration has approved morethan 100 home test kits for sale.   Among the most popular kits, used in 1 percent of the nation'shomes, are those that let diabetics monitor blood sugar in urine orblood. Americans will spend more than $200 million this year forthose kits or similar tests for urinary tract infection, accordingto the New York market research firm of Find@SVP.   Other kits and their expected sales this year include:   _Devices for testing blood pressure, $128 million.   _Pregnancy and ovulation detection kits, $97 million. In 1986consumers bought 6.1 million pregnancy test kits and about 500,000ovulation kits.   _Tests that indicate blood in the stool, a sign of possiblecolon or rectum cancer, $43 million.   And the thermometer? Americans are expected to spend $57 millionthis year on them, Find@SVP says.   Medical authorities say home health testing is fine, but theyhave some reservations.   The American Medical Association believes the kits can help byinvolving people in decisions about their own health and gettingthem to doctors sooner if there is trouble, says William McGivney,the AMA's director of technology assessment.   But there is concern about diagnostic kits, which would be usedby people who have a symptom and are trying to find out what theproblem is. In this case, a false negative result _ in which thetest fails to detect the disease _ could make things worse byencouraging the patient to ignore his condition, McGivney says.   Tests must be especially accurate if a false negative resultpresents a substantial risk to the user or other people, in thecase of infectious diseases, McGivney says.   The FDA shares the concern about such kits, said ThomasTsakeris, deputy director of FDA's division of clinical andlaboratory devices in the Office of Device Evaluation.   FDA is now reviewing a kit for strep throat that illustrates thedilemma, he says.   ``Naturally you want to get at that condition and perhaps reacha population of infecteds you wouldn't normally reach,'' he says.But ``if you have a high incidence of false negatives and thecondition persists, there's a public health risk there'' becausethe strep bacteria could spread.   FDA assesses candidate test kits case-by-case, looking for ``aclear benefit that overcomes any reasonable risk,'' he says.   No test is always accurate, and few tests in the home orlaboratory are sufficient to diagnose diseases by themselves evenwhen they produce an accurate result, he says.   ``If you were to have a test performed in a doctor's office,that test would probably be ordered...in light of other medicalinformation that the physician would use. It would be part of adiagnostic examination,'' he says.   ``Those tests are now being offered directly (to the public)without the availability of the other diagnostic information thephysician would have.''   The FDA blocked home kits for acquired immune deficiencysyndrome in April when it essentially forbade kit developers fromcollecting the data necessary for marketing approval. FDA officialshad expressed skepticism about home testing for AIDS, because it isfatal and because federal guidelines say testing should beaccompanied by counseling.   In general, Tsakeris said, the FDA wants test kits to work asaccurately in the hands of consumers as they do in the lab. Almostall home use kits are based on tests originally used in clinicallaboratories, he says.   A manufacturer might be able to justify approving a kit withlesser performance if it is ``exquisitely simple,'' deals with asubstantial health concern and promises to encourage more people toseek medical care, Tsakeris said. No approvals have been grantedyet on that basis.   Several factors can reduce the accuracy of home test kits. Thetest for blood in the stool, for example, has so much potential forwrong results that a doctor should supervise its use, says JoannSchellenbach, spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society.   Inaccurate positive or negative readings can occur if a person'sdiet is not adjusted for two days before the test. It can give afalse positive reading if the person has taken a lot of aspirin,had his teeth cleaned or just eaten a rare steak, she said.   Such cautions are explained in material accompanying the kits,but people tend to ignore them, she says. The instructions are morelikely to be followed on a doctor's advice, she says.   In all, the cancer society considers the kits of only limiteduse, she says, and physician exams are the best way to detect earlycolon or rectum cancer.   But the test kits may be valuable when people just won't go tothe doctor unless the home test gives them reason to, she says.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 14</NOTE></DOC>
