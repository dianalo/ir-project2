The petitioner,the Cast Iron Pipe Fittings Committee, requested in accordance with andSection;353.53a(a) of the Commerce Regulations that we conduct an administrativereview. We published a notice of initiation of the review on June 29, 1988(53 FR 24470). The Department has now conducted that administrative reviewin accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the TariffAct'').<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of the Review </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule(``HTS''), as provided for in section 1201 et seq. of the Omnibus Tradeand Competitiveness Act of 1988. All merchandise entered, or withdrawnfrom warehouse, for consumption on or after that date is now classifiedsolely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s).  Imports covered by this review are shipments of Taiwan malleable cast-ironpipe fittings, other than grooved. During the review period such merchandisewas classified under items 610.7000 and 610.7400 of the Tariff Schedulesof the United States Annotated. This merchandise is currently classifiableunder HTS item 7307.19.10. The HTS item number is provided for convenienceand Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The review covers five Taiwan manufacturers and/or exporters to the UnitedStates of malleable cast-iron pipe fittings, other than grooved, and theperiod May 1, 1987 through April 30, 1988. One firm had no shipments tothe U.S. during the period. Two firms did not respond to our antidumpingquestionnaires. The remaining two firms submitted inadequate questionnaireresponses. Kwang Yu Foundry Industrial Co., Ltd. (``Kwang Yu'') and DeHo Metal Industrial Co., Ltd. (``De Ho'') failed to respond to our originalquestionnaire and forwarded inadequate responses to our supplemental requests.Both firms failed to provide certain information requested in the Department'squestionnaire. In addition, information on the firms' computer printoutdid not match information on their computer tapes, either because dataprovided in one differed from that provided in the other or because dataprovided in one was not provided in the other. Therefore, the Departmentused best information available, which was each firm's rate from the fairvalue investigation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Results of the Review   </ITAG>As a result of our review we preliminarily determine that the followingmargins exist for the period May 1, 1987 through April 30, 1988: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s10,16 </C> <H1>Manufacturer/exporter </H1><H1>Margin (percent)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">De Ho <D>13.12  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Kwang Yu <D>7.93  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">San Yang <D>27.90  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tai Yang <D>*37.09  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Young Shieng <D>80.00 </D><F> *No shipments during the period; margin from last period in which therewere shipments.</F></ITAG></ITAG>  Parties to the proceeding may request disclosure and/or an administrativeprotective order within 5 days of the date of publication of this noticeand may request a hearing within 8 days of publication.
