The Philippine Red Cross said about 600 people were missing onPalawan alone, after widespread flooding and landslides caused byheavy rain generated by Tess, the second of three storms to hit thecountry between Oct. 24 and Nov. 7.   Tito Larrosa, coordinator of the government's Office of CivilDefense on Palawan, said in many instances the landslides and floodshit simultaneously last Friday and Saturday.   ``In Rizal, when the water came from the mountains, it wasfollowed by the mud,'' Larrosa said in a telephone interview fromthe Palawan provincial capital of Puerto Princesa, 370 milessouthwest of Manila.   He said in many places along the island's north-south coastalroad, ``the water rose up to seven feet.''   ``We heard about the floods on Nov. 6, but it was not only untilyesterday that the reports of the deaths started coming,'' he said.``We have not heard from the Calamian group,'' a cluster of islandsnorth of Palawan that is part of the province.   Palawan, 270 miles long, is known as the Philippines' ``lastfrontier'' because of its ruggedness and, with the exception of theprovincial capital, its isolation from the rest of the country.   He said among the hardest hit towns was Rizal, where 23 peoplewere confirmed killed by the floods and landslides.   Until the reports from Palawan came in, officials had reportedonly 11 deaths from tropical storm Tess, which hit the country lastweekend.   Officials said 181 people were killed on land when Typhoon Rubystruck Oct. 24. At least 64 more people drowned when the ferry DonaMarilyn sank at the height of its fury. Another 200 passengers aremissing and presumed dead.   The death toll from Typhoon Skip, which hit the centralPhilippines Nov. 7, stood at 139 today. But officials said theyexpected it to rise further as more reports from remote areas camein.</TEXT></DOC>
