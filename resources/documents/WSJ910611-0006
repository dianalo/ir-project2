Olsen.   Selling them has proved more difficult.</LP><TEXT>   Digital invested its pride, years of work by its bestengineers and more than $1 billion to build its new line ofmainframes, the most complex and powerful machines thecompany has ever built. Analysts said the line would generaterevenue of as much as $1 billion in its first year, poachingsales from industry leader International Business MachinesCorp., in its most lucrative market.   But the clash of titans hasn't happened. Digitalexecutives now predict they'll ship 325 mainframes by June30, well short of their original business plan. At an average$1.4 million apiece, the line will yield less than half therevenue analysts had forecast for its first year.   Digital's problems so far underscore the difficulty ofattacking an entrenched competitor, even with a less-costlyproduct that analysts say is at least equal in quality. Andit shows that in mainframes, as in everything else, timing iscritical.   While largely invisible to most people, mainframes humbehind glass walls at the heart of every major corporation,juggling accounting, billing, inventory and more. And whilesmaller, nimbler machines have slowed annual growth in themainframe market into single digits, it's still a profitable,$40 billion business -- and still dominated by IBM.   Other companies have tried and failed to make a run atIBM. NCR Corp., Honeywell Inc., Control Data Corp. and othersgot burned, while successful mainframe makers -- AmdahlCorp., Fujitsu Ltd. and Hitachi Ltd. -- all compete on IBM'sterms, with IBM-compatible machines, unlike Digital.   So this latest assault on IBM by its largest U.S.competitor had been closely watched. But Digital's effortshave been met &quot;with a great big Bronx cheer,&quot; says BarryBosak, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. He saysthe VAX 9000 has had little effect yet on IBM, which shipped2,263 of its flagship 3090 line last year, according tomarket researcher International Data Corp.   The slow start has hurt Digital, which has been countingon the high-margin line to ignite new profit. In the ninemonths ended March 30, earnings fell 23% to $253.9 million,while revenue, hurt by declining minicomputer sales, rosejust 4%, to $9.97 billion.   More than anything else, Digital's timing was bad --perhaps fatally so. Digital was hot in 1988, and its bigcustomers were clamoring for a more powerful machine. But thecompany decided to cancel a water-cooled mainframe design --all of IBM's are water-cooled -- and concentrate on advancedtechnology that required no plumbing, a key competitiveadvantage. That cost perhaps a year.   When the new design was unveiled in the fall of 1989,setbacks in manufacturing pushed back volume shipmentsanother year. By then, recession was looming and capitalspending by big companies was slowing. At the same time, anindustrywide trend toward smaller, faster machines usingstandard software was sapping mainframe sales.   &quot;Digital probably missed the window that would have madethis machine a big success,&quot; says Marc Schulman, a UBSSecurities Inc. analyst.   Digital says it isn't backing off. &quot;We're in this for thelong haul,&quot; says product manager William Askins. And hepoints out that Digital's expected shipments of 325 units thefirst year actually surpassed IBM's first year with the 3090,when it shipped 302 units.   Customers so far seem pleased with the product. At U SWest Inc., the Colorado-based telephone company, &quot;we likedours so much we're getting a bigger one,&quot; says Peggy Kaye,technology director for the company's law group. She says themachine has been &quot;much easier to install and operate than anIBM mainframe.&quot;   But some buyers worry about Digital's slow start. &quot;If theydon't meet their business plan, are we going to be leftowning a mainframe without a real future?&quot; asks George Kerns,a vice president of GTE Corp.'s cellular telephone unit inAtlanta. He also says the company found unexpected softwarebugs when its machine arrived last year. &quot;I guess a fewglitches are the price of admission with new technology --but we didn't volunteer to be a test site,&quot; Mr. Kerns says.&quot;The delays hurt our business.&quot;   Still, &quot;we're impressed with the machine's performance,which is truly mainframe-class, and with Digital'sresponsiveness,&quot; he says. Digital has assigned three peopleto work full-time at GTE, borrowing a page from IBM, whichwrote the book on customer support.   Early buyers were rattled by a glitch that caused somesystems to crash when used in certain applications. Digitalquickly fixed the problem, but it was yet another setback:The complex circuit modules coming off alreadyproblem-plagued production lines had to be used to fix theaffected computers, rather than build new ones.   Digital's share of the market -- measuring only the 180units shipped during 1990 -- stands at 4%, making itfifth-largest after just six months, estimates InternationalData, the market researcher. IBM and IBM-compatible makers,including Fujitsu, Hitachi and Amdahl, account for more than80% of shipments, while Unisys Corp.'s share is 9%.   Despite its slow start, analysts say Digital's mainframegives it a breadth of products shared only by IBM and one ortwo other companies. Digital also attracts a new class ofcomputer user: At MIT, scientists are using their new Digitalmainframe to create hull designs for a sailboat that willcompete in next year's America's Cup race in San Diego.</TEXT></DOC>
