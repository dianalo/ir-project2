LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former President Chun Doo-hwan decidedto cut short a visit to the United States after prosecutors linkedhis brother to a growing government corruption scandal, officialssaid Thursday.   The prosecutor general's office said its inquiry of corruptioninvolving the Saemaul development group may be expanded toinvestigate other possible wrongdoings under the Chunadministration.   Chun, who has not been implicated, yielded power on Feb. 25 toPresident Roh Tae-woo. But Chun has clung to a measure of powerbehind the scenes.   Prosecutors said Thursday that about 200 Saemaul and governmentofficials had been questioned since Monday to find out if Chun'syounger brother, former Saemaul leader Chun Kyung-hwan, and hisaides amassed fortunes by embezzling the group's funds.   The former president was on a three-week private visit to theUnited States in which he met with President Reagan on Wednesday,but South Korean officials said Thursday he planned to leave early.   The opposition parties contend the government is trying to hidethe extent of corruption under Chun. They have called for a broaderinquiry that would look into any corruption by the Chun family andsupporters.   The ruling Democratic Justice Party has rejected the charges asan attempt to blacken the government's reputation. But its leaderspromised to investigate any official corruption.   The semi-official Saemaul, or ``new community,'' is a group ofcommunity leaders that has evolved into a huge organization sinceit was created in 1971 to promote urban development. It haslaunched projects from building model communities to organizingneighborhood clean-ups.   But critics have said Saemaul worked with past authoritariangovernments to organize support and dole out patronage.   Prosecutors said Thursday they had uncovered more evidence thatSaemaul officials embezzled millions of dollars, peddled governmentpatronage and misappropriated property. They said they questionedgovernment officials to find out if they aided corrruption withinSaemaul.   Prosecutors also said the younger Chun was suspected ofdiverting Saemaul funds to personal land speculation and of makingmoney with influence peddling. Local newspapers reported theyounger Chun and his aides may soon be officially charged withcorruption, but prosecutors declined to confirm the reports.   Many in South Korea believe the new government is using theSaemaul investigation to discredit the former president.   Roh, a former general who helped put Chun into power withmilitary backing in 1980, has vowed to end authoritarian rule andhas been moving to cut ties with the former president. Top Chunsupporters have been removed from the ruling party and the formerpresident's role as a government adviser has been reduced to alargely ceremonial function.   However, members of the opposition Party for Peace and Democracysay Roe may also have been involved in the corruption when heserved as home minister in 1982.</TEXT></DOC>
