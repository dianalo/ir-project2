Jesse Helms has been hotly defending us all from &quot;obscene and indecent&quot; art. He is riding high after his amendment cutting appropriations for the National Endowment for the Arts sailed through a nearly empty chamber on a voice vote. Then the arts world noticed, and the din hasn't stopped.    Sen. Helms, never known for his passionate attachment to the art of his time, found a perfect target (and a perfect magnet for publicity) in two photographic exhibitions that had been partly funded with federal grants. One included a shot of a crucifix supposedly submerged in the urine of the photographer, one Andres Serrano. The other was a traveling show of tulips, celebrities and homosexual sado-masochistic practices photographed by the late Robert Mapplethorpe. The fuss started when Washington's staid Corcoran Gallery of Art canceled the Mapplethorpe show. The less-prestigious Washington Project for the Arts (WPA) defiantly picked up the exhibit, soon playing it to packed houses. But by then, the stage was set for a full-scale war between the self-appointed yahoos and the self-appointed defenders of artistic freedom and the First Amendment. &quot;I knew we would regret the end of the Cold War,&quot; says New York's Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.    By last week, so many positions had been taken and salvos fired that detachment or the long view was everywhere to be found. &quot;This reflects an attitude toward art that's been here for 200 years, that art is not part of the tradition of this country,&quot; says William Luers, president of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. &quot;My real concern is that this will result in more tax-policy changes {similar to the 1986 tax reforms that discouraged donations of art to institutions} that will further devastate museums.&quot;    &quot;Oh, you have to recognize that this does happen periodically,&quot; agrees J. Carter Brown, director of Washington's National Gallery. &quot;We are saddled with a Philistine heritage, but I've been here 28 years and Congress has shown a great deal more tolerance. So one is disappointed, but I see no great change of course.&quot;    Others see the beginning of the end -- or at least an ominous transmogrification -- of the NEA, which statistically has been on the side of the angels. In its quarter century of federal philanthropy, some 85,000 grants have been awarded to individual artists and arts organizations, of which one-quarter of one-tenth of one percent has been considered controversial. But now Rep. Sidney Yates, Congress's staunchest champion of the arts and a masterful boll weevil, has begun to buckle, carving up parts of the heretofore sacrosanct $170 million endowment. A $45,000 slap-on-the-wrist cut in NEA funding and some potentially meaningless changes in sub-granting procedures have already passed the House version of the endowment's appropriations bill. &quot;I thought this was a way of allowing {Congress} to vote its concern without crippling the NEA,&quot; explains Mr. Yates.    &quot;Bull,&quot; says Sen. Helms.    When Congress reconvenes next month, Rep. Yates must do battle with the Helms forces (headed by Sen. Robert Byrd) in the closed-door conference committee. In addition to Mr. Helms's amendment -- which also seeks to deny federal funding to any artist whose work &quot;denigrates, debases or reviles a person, group or class of citizens on the base of race, creed, sex, handicap, age or national origin&quot; -- other Senate-sponsored riders would cut overall endowment funding by $1.2 million below the House appropriations; would specifically punish the visual arts program (which, ironically, had no part in either exhibit) with a $400,000 cut; and most punitively, would slap a five-year ban on any federal funding to Philadelphia's Institute of Contemporary Art (which originated the Mapplethorpe show) and the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art (which awarded Mr. Serrano his $15,000 grant).    The Senate has also proposed a $100,000 research grant for an inquiry into the current endowment funding procedures -- the peer panel review system.    Sen. Helms seems to have no second thoughts about all this. Drawing deeply on a Lucky Strike, he says: &quot;We never had a problems with {the NEA} until an acknowledged homosexual who died of AIDS -- and I'm sorry he did -- came along with a series of photographs designed to promote homosexuality. There I draw the line.&quot;    It is a line that many Beltway Cassandras say may divide lawmakers in &quot;the smut and obscenity vote of the year,&quot; a line running through an exceptionally tricky political quagmire, in which the basic aesthetic issues tend to sink below the surface.    &quot;It is difficult for any congressman to stand on the floor of Congress and go against this because the RNC {Republican National Committee} has made it a partisan issue,&quot; explains one Washington art lobbyist. &quot;Every congressman is thinking how the ad will play at home.&quot;    Under Lee Atwater's take-no-prisoners chairmanship, the RNC has been busy faxing and mailing press releases reading &quot;{your} Congressmen voted to continue the NEA's practice of using their District's taxpayers' hard-earned money to underwrite this kind of . . . taxpayer-financed obscenity.&quot;    As one museum director, who asked not to be identified, says, &quot;This is nothing more than a delicious windfall for the Religious Right.&quot; Indeed, this latest shouting match about free speech, First Amendment rights and taxpayer-financed pornography comes at a time when the &quot;vox populi&quot; is raised in a full-throated roar. The Rev. Donald Wildmon of Tupelo, Miss., first raised a fuss about Martin Scorsese's &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ.&quot; Then he brought PepsiCo to its knees over Madonna's sexy, crucifix-dangling video. Meanwhile, citizeness Terry Rakolta trapped Fox Television into tempering its &quot;Married . . . With Children.&quot; The Supreme Court stoked the fire with its decision protecting flag burning. Now, Rev. Wildmon has taken up the Serrano picture as his &quot;cause celebre&quot;. His letter-writing campaign is said to have hit six figures.    Washington seems particularly vulnerable to this kind of pressure when the indecorous happens in its own backyard. Earlier this year, the Kennedy Center refused to stage &quot;Mastergate,&quot; Larry Gelbart's Broadway-bound Iran/Contra satire, on the grounds that the Center was &quot;too dependent on the government.&quot;    Certainly the Corcoran, an endowmentless private museum whose stock in trade is 19th-century American landscapes and whose board of trustees tends toward &quot;the spineless&quot; as one Washington lobbyist put it, was unprepared to take the anti-Mapplethorpe heat. Although Corcoran director Christina Orr-Cahall denies she caved in to congressional pressure, she has admitted there are &quot;always practical concerns.&quot;    Like a handful of other D.C. arts organizations, the Corcoran receives its NEA funding as well as the equivalent of its state funding directly from Congress through the National Capital Arts and Cultural Affairs program of the Fine Arts Commission.    Meanwhile, this town snoozes through the August recess, waiting for the post-Labor Day conference committee to start pumping vitriol again. One olive branch that has appeared: Sen. Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Senate endowment reauthorizing committee that meets next year, has insisted he is &quot;reluctant to take further steps to alter&quot; the NEA's existing procedures. The smart money here is on some sort of back-room compromise involving a token slap -- financial and procedural -- at the NEA. Some even predict that the five-year funding ban, which is probably unconstitutional, will be allowed to stand, thereby making it a legal rather than a political hot potato.    But even if the NEA suffers nothing more than short-term cutbacks and procedural changes, others expect the oft-mentioned chilling effect to settle on the art world. Already several artists are refusing to show at the Corcoran. The Illinois state legislature has punished the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (which mounted the controversial &quot;What Is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?&quot; exhibit that had veterans and state senators in a don't-tread-on-me uproar earlier this year) by reducing the school's state subsidy from $65,000 to $1.    Meanwhile, the price of Mapplethorpe photographs has reportedly zoomed. If Sen. Helms stays the course, Mr. Serrano may even find someone to buy his crucifix.    ---Ms. de Vries is a free-lance arts writer based in Boston. </TEXT></DOC>
