<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-90-1058 </DOCNO><TEXT>Solvent extraction of uranyl sulfate in a wide range of its concentrationby the mixtures of di-2-ethylhexylphosphoric acid (HX) with organic oxides(B)-triisoamyl (TAPO)-, triphenyl(TPPO)-phosphine oxides, 2-nonylpyridine-N-oxide(2-NPO) and diphenyl sulfoxide (DPSO) is studied. Cation exchange andnoncation exchange (after HX saturation) synergistic effects are stated.By synergistic effect in uranyl sulfate noncation exchange extraction(UO/sub 2/X/sub 2/+B mixture is in fact an extracting agent) organicoxides are arranged in TAPOandgt;2-NPOandgt;TPPOandgt;DPSO series coinsiding with thesequence of decreasing donor ability of B in hydrogen bond. A quantitativedescription of UO/sub 2/SO/sub 4/xB addition to UO/sub 2/X/sub 2/ ispresented. It is stated that regularities of coordination extractionof metals by different class oxides and of uranyl sulfate extractionby UO/sub 2/X/sub 2/+B mixtures are similar.</TEXT></DOC>
