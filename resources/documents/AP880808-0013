DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A surrogate campaigner for George Bush hasbeen trying to reassure the political right that the vice presidentisn't straying too far from conservative doctrine as he movestoward the center in his presidential campaign.   The surrogate's name is Ronald Reagan.   Increasingly the president sprinkles his speeches with suchphrases as ``Vice President Bush and I'' and ``Nancy, VicePresident Bush and me.''   He also has both praised and glossed over positions that Bushhas taken that are at variance with his own conservative stands.   In a recent speech to a group of evangelical youth, for example,he tackled the issue of day care for children. Reagan has opposedgovernment-subsidized child care proposals.   Bush, however, trails in the polls among women voters and hasattempted to close that ``gender gap'' with proposals including a$2.2 billion plan to give low-income families a $1,000-per-childtax credit for day care.   Conservatives have generally been against this kind of thing,and it is one of a number of issues on which Bush has beenexploring new territory in a campaign that is expected to be foughtout in the political center.   Reagan, speaking to the Student Congress on Evangelism,approached the matter this way:   ``Vice President Bush has proposed an innovative plan, one thatwould strengthen the family. ... The basic idea here is that thegovernment would simply let families keep up to $1,000 more oftheir own money. That's money the family itself can decide how tospend. Working mothers could put the money toward child care. Butby giving each family this tax credit the vice president's planwould also permit thousands of mothers to choose to stay home withtheir children.''   Reagan suggests that even though it goes against the grain oftraditional conservative thought, Bush's day-care program is reallypro-family and amounts to a kind of tax cut _ things thatconservatives like.   The president also tiptoed around the differences between hisposition and the vice president's on abortion.   Bush has said he would accept abortion if necessary to save thelife of the mother or in instances of rape and incest. Thepresident has said repeatedly he would accept the operation only ifneeded to save the mother's life.   The way Reagan spelled it out to the evangelicals was:   ``Many who seek abortions do so in harrowing circumstances. Andjust as tolerance means accepting that many in good faith holdviews different from our own, it also means that no man or womanshould sit in judgment on another. I believe _ and Vice PresidentBush believes with me _ that we must rise above bitterness andreproach to find positive answers to the tragedy of abortion.''   No mention of their differences _ just ``positive answers'' forpeople in ``harrowing circumstances.''   As the campaign goes on, Bush is expected to stake outincreasingly independent stands.   ``He's talking about education, he's talking about child care,soon he is going to be talking about flexibility in defenseposture, he's talking about public service,'' said Stephen J.Wayne, a specialist in the presidency and electoral politics atGeorge Washington University.   Not the usual fare for conservative rallies.   So are Reagan's explanations part of a plan to bolster Bush'sconservative credentials?   ``I don't know if it has been strategically laid out as such,but it makes sense,'' said Daniel L. Casey, executive director ofthe American Conservative Union. ``That is probably the single bestway to use him.''</TEXT><TEXT>   _   EDITOR'S NOTE _ W.
