But just after the new year their home is burglarized and bothgifts become ghosts of Christmas past, because neither wasadequately insured.   Insurance companies often paint such gloomy scenarios to helpdrum up more business and some have been doing a lot of it withconcerted media campaigns during the current holiday buying season.   For many consumers, a little extra insurance can protect valuedgifts and provide peace of mind _ but experts say coverage andcosts vary significanlty between companies and states.   ``Don't buy the first policy that someone tries to sell you,''says Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Washington-basedConsumer Federation of America.   Brobeck urges consumers to first check their homeowner or tenantinsurance policies to see what's covered. If an item in question isvaluable enough to be insured separately, they should shop aroundfor the best rates, he said.   Other coverage may be available from credit card companies.American Express, for example, automatically insures goods boughtwith its cards for up to 90 days. Visa and MasterCard extend suchcoverage to holders of their premium gold and platinum cards.   Most standard homeowner or tenant policies provide limitedcoverage of valuables from a wide assortment of what insurers call``perils,'' which usually include theft, fire, or wind damage, butnot loss due to one's own negligence.   For example, standard policies likely will insure all jewelry inyour home, including watches, precious or semi-precious stones, fora total of up to $1,000. Coverage for silver and goldware generallyis capped at $2,500.   Consumers can get extra coverage by purchasing ``floaters,'' or``riders,'' that are attached to their regular policies.   Rates vary from state to state, and even from one part of townto the next.   The average cost of insuring a piece of jewelry in South Dakota,for instance, is 80 cents per $100 of appraised value. Insurance onthat same item in Brooklyn, New York, would cost $4.50 per $100,but in nearby Manhattan it costs around $1.30, according to the NewYork-based trade group Insurance Information Institute.   Insurance premiums also vary depending on whether the appraisedpieces are classified as ``scheduled'' or ``unscheduled,'' andwhether the policy offers ``agreed value'' or ``actual cash value''coverage, said Arlene LaGrassa, vice president of KornreichInsurance Services in New York.   Scheduled coverage pays off on an item no matter how it's lost,but with unscheduled property collection is possible only if theitem is stolen or destroyed in a fire, she said.   Agreed value coverage means that at the time of collection theinsured will receive the full amount for which the item is insured,while the actual cash value takes depreciation into account,allowing the policyholder to collect a replacement of equal valueor an amount that may be less than current market value, she said.   Neither, however, accounts for appreciation, so a policyholdereventually could end up paying more to update coverage.   ``A sophisticated broker recognizes when diamonds or gold arechanging in value and ... review schedules and policies with you,''said John Karanik, a senior vice president for Atlantic MutualInsurance Co. in New York.   But Brobeck sees other alternatives. ``One strategy that peoplemight want to take is to spend the money they would have spent oninsurance on improving their home security, such as adding wallsafes,'' he said. ``Bank safe deposit boxes also are much cheaper.''</TEXT></DOC>
