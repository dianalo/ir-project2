<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-24-0909 </DOCNO><TEXT>The display of diagnostic images is accomplished in the UCLA PediatricRadiology Clinical Radiology Imaging System (CRIS) using 3 differenttypes of digital viewing stations. These include a low resolution stationwith six 512 x 512 monitors, a high resolution station with three 1024x 1024 monitors, and a very high resolution workstation with two 2048x 2048 monitors. The display stations provide very basic image processingmanipulations including zoom and scroll, contrast enhancement, and contrastreversal. The display stations are driven by a computer system whichis dedicated for clinical use. During times when the clinical computeris unavailable (maintenance or system malfunction), the 512 x 512 workstationcan be switched to operate from a research PACS system in the UCLA ImageProcessing Laboratory via a broadband communication network. Our initialclinical implementation involves digital viewing for pediatric radiologyconferences. Presentation of inpatient cases use the six monitor 512x 512 multiple viewing station. Later stages of the clinical implementationinvolve the use of higher resolution displays for the purpose of primarydiagnosis from video displays.</TEXT></DOC>
