Background </ITAG>Statutory Background In addition to the general environmental protection performance standardsapplicable to all lands, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Actof 1977 (the Act), 30 U.S.C. 1201 <T3>et seq., </T3>provides specific protection for alluvial valley floors(AVFs). Section 701(1) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1291(1), defines ``alluvialvalley floors'' as ``unconsolidated stream laid deposits holding streamswhere water availability is sufficient for subirrigation of flood irrigationagricultural activities * * *.'' As discussed in more detail below, thenature of the protection afforded to AVFs is two-fold. The performancestandards of section 515 of the Act protect all AVFs by requiring the preservationthroughout the mining and reclamation process of the essential hydrologicfunctions of AVFs. In addition, the permitting requirements of section510 of the Act prohibit surface coal mining operations for interrupting,discontinuing or precluding farming on certain AVFs. Thus, certain ``farmed''AVFs have an absolute safeguard, while other AVFs are protected withoutprecluding mining. Subject to a number of exceptions, section 510(b)(5) of the Act, 30 U.S.C.1260(b)(5), requires a surface coal mining operation permit applicationto demonstrate affirmatively, and the regulatory authority to find in writing,that a number of requirements unique to AVFs would be satisfied by theproposed operation. Section 510(b)(5)(A) requires that the applicationdemonstrate that the surface coal mining operation would ``not interrupt,discontinue, or preclude farming on alluvial valley floors that are irrigatedor naturally subirrigated * * *.'' In addition, section 510(b)(5)(B) requiresa demonstration that the operation would not materially damage the quantityor quality of water in surface or underground water systems that supplythe AVFs referred to in paragraph (5)(A). As provided in section 510(b)(5) these requirements do not apply to: (1) Surface coal mining operations located east of the 100th meridian westlongitude; (2) Undeveloped range lands which are not significant to farming on theAVFs; (3) Lands for which the regulatory authority finds that the mining operationwill only interrupt, discontinue or preclude farming of ``such small acreageas to be of negligible impact on the farm's agricultural production[;]''and (4) Those surface coal mining operations which in the year preceding theenactment of the Act (August 3, 1977) produced coal in commercial quantities,and were located within or adjacent to AVFs or had specific permit approvalfrom the State regulatory authority to conduct surface coal mining operationson AVFs. Another exemption from the section 510(b)(5) requirements is provided bysection 506(d)(2) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1256(d)(2), for new operationsproposed in an application for renewal or revision of a permit issued underthe Act where the new operations extend to land beyond the boundaries authorizedin the original permit. This exemption applies only if (1) the new landpreviously was identified in the reclamation plan submitted under section508 of the Act, and (2) the original operations were exempt from the requirementsof section 510(b)(5) of the Act under the section 510(b)(5) proviso foroperations which produced coal in commercial quantities in the year precedingenactment of the Act. However, even where mining of AVFs is allowed under section 510(b)(5) ofthe Act, the hydrologic protection requirements of section 515(b)(10)(F)of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1265(b)(10), will apply. Section 515(b)(10)(F) requiressurface mining operations to minimize disturbances to the prevailing hydrologicbalance at the mine site and in associated off site areas, and to the qualityand quantity of water in surface and ground water systems both during andafter surface coal mining operations by preserving throughout the miningand reclamation process the essential hydrologic functions of AVFs in thearid and semiarid areas of the country.Regulatory History and Court Decisions_Section 701.5 Definition of ``agriculturalactivities or farming'' The definition of AVFs in section 701 of the Act uses the term ``agriculturalactivities,'' and its definition is thus relevant to determining what isand what is not an AVF subject to the protection of sections 510(b)(5)and 515(b)(10)(F) of the Act. The term ``farming'' is used in section 510(b)(5)of the Act and is relevant to determining the scope of the additional protectionprovided by that section. The term ``agricultural activities'' was firstdefined in a final rule published on March 13, 1979 (44 FR 15317). Therule did not define the term ``farming.'' On June 28, 1983 (48 FR 29820),the substance of the definition was revised somewhat, and its scope wasexpanded to cover either ``agricultural activities <T3>or </T3>farming.'' Under the revised definition the term ``agriculturalactivities or farming'' meant: <ITAG tagnum="21">[W]ith respect to alluvial valley floors, the use of any tract ofland for the production of animal or vegetable life, based on regionalagricultural practices, where the use is enhanced or facilitated by subirrigationor flood irrigation. These uses include, but are not limited to, pasturingor grazing of livestock, and the cropping, cultivation, or harvesting ofplants whose production is aided by the availability of water from subirrigationor flood irrigation. Those uses do not include agricultural activitieswhich have no relationship to the availability of water from subirrigationor flood irrigation practices. </ITAG>The preamble to the June 28, 1983 rule (48 FR 29803) stated that althoughthe Act and OSMRE's regulations use both the terms ``agricultural activities''and ``farming,'' their meaning with respect to AVFs is the same. Coal industry plaintiffs in <T3>In Re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation (II), </T3>No.79-1144 (D.D.C. October 1, 1984), hereafter <T3>In Re: Permanent II, </T3>challenged the combined definition of ``agriculturalactivities or farming'' arguing that the term ``agricultural activities''is more general than the term ``farming,'' and thus encompasses more landuses.Reasoning that the use of two different terms in the Act indicated a congressionalintent to prescribe a different meaning to each, the district court in<T3>In Re: Permanent II</T3> remanded the definition of ``agriculturalactivities or farming.'' Slip op. at 30-31. The court held that the Secretarymust reconsider the definition and any additional regulations necessaryto conform them to Congressional intent. On February 21, 1985, OSMRE suspendedthe definition (50 FR 7274). OSMRE since has reconsidered the definitionand has proposed separate definitions for ``agricultural activities'' and``farming.'' OSMRE has also proposed other rule changes needed for conformitywith the proposed definitions.At the same time, the coal industry plaintiffs argued that the reach ofthe protection provided by andSection;515(b)(10) should be the same as thatof andSection;510(b)(5). They were unsuccessful both with the district courtand, upon appeal, with the United States Court of Appeals for the Districtof Columbia Circuit. See <T3>NWF v. Hodel,</T3> 839 F.2d 694, (D.C. Cir. 1988), hereafter <T3>NWF v. Hodel.</T3> The appeals court held that it is appropriate forthe Secretary to consider that andSection;515(b)(10)(F) reaches to AVFs notprotected by andSection;510(b)(5). (<T3>Id.</T3> at 746.)Section 785.19(d)(2)(i) Information on the essential hydrologic functionsof alluvial valley floors.The March 13, 1979, permanent program rules at 30 CFR 785.19(d)(3) (44FR 15375) described specific information, surveys and analyses that a surfacecoal mining and reclamation permit application was required to includeconcerning the geologic, hydrologic and biologic characteristics that supportthe essential hydrologic functions of AVFs. These rules were revised byOSMRE on June 28, 1983 (48 FR 29821) as part of a major revision of theAVF rules. The revised regulation at 30 CFR 785.19(d)(2)(i) required thatthe permit application include detailed surveys and baseline data requiredby the regulatory authority for a determination of the characteristicsof AVFs which are necessary to preserve their essential hydrologic functionsthroughout the mining and reclamation process. However, the details formerlycontained in andSection; 785.19(d)(3) of precisely what such surveys andbaseline data should consist of had been deleted.The citizen and environmental plaintiffs in <T3>In Re: Permanent II </T3>challenged the deletion of the specific requirementsfrom the rule on the grounds that the preamble to the rule contained inadequatejustification for the revision. The court remanded 30 CFR 785.19(d)(2)(i)for OSMRE to provide guidance to operators and regulatory authorities asto what type of information was required or explain why such guidance isno longer needed. Slip op. at 39-40. The appeals court affirmed the districtcourt remand, concluding the Secretary did not adequately explain why suchguidance was deleted (<T3>NWF v. Hodel, </T3>at 729-31). Accordingly, OSMRE is amending andSection;785.19.The proposed rule, incorporating changes to the definitions and to theinformation requirements to the essential hydrologic functions of AVFs,was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on August 3, 1988 (53 FR 29310). Public hearingswere scheduled for August 31, 1988 in Washington, DC and Denver, CO. Sinceno one requested to testify at these hearings, none were held. The commentperiod closed on September 19, 1988. OSMRE received comments from 15 sources:the State regulatory authorities of Utah and Wyoming, the Bureau of LandManagement, five public interest groups, four individuals representingconsulting firms, two individual landowners and a mining industry association.One commenter requested an additional 30 days for comment. OSMRE did notaccede to the request; however, OSMRE did give full consideration to allcomments received regardless of whether the comments were timely or late.The rules adopted today replace the definition suspended in 1985 and respondto the court decisions described above. The minor changes from the proposedrule are identified in the following detailed discussion of the final rule.Based on an analysis of the issues involved, the legislative history ofthe Act, applicable court decisions, and the administrative record of thisrulemaking, inlcuding comments received, this final rule is a proper andreasonable interpretation of the provisions of sections 701(1), 510(b)(5)and 510(b)(10) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Final Rule and Response to Comments </ITAG><T3>General</T3>. The final rule removes the definition of the term ``agriculturalactivities <T3>or </T3>farming'' from 30 CFR 701.5 and replaces it with separate definitionsof the terms ``agricultural activities'' and ``farming.'' To conform relatedAVF rules with these proposed definitions OSMRE also has revised the definitionof ``materially damage the quantity or quality of water'' and has revised30 CFR 785.19(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3). OSMRE also has revised 30 CFR 785.19(d)(2)(i)in response to the court order to provide guidance to operators and regulatoryauthorities as to what type of information about potentially affected AVFsmust be placed in a permit application.Each of these changes and the public comments received concerning themare discussed in detail below. A. Section 701.5 Definitions of ``agricultural activities'' and ``farming''The final rule at 30 CFR 701.5 removes the suspended definition of theterm ``agricultural activities <T3>or </T3>farming'' and replaces it with separate definitions of theterms ``agricultural activities'' and ``farming.'' OSMRE has made thischange following reexamination of both the language and legislative historyof the Act in response to the remand order issued by the district court.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Court Decision </ITAG>The district court in <T3>In Re: Permanent II </T3>stated: ``Congress used the term `agriculturalactivities' in its definition of AVFs, 30 U.S.C. 1291(1), and `farming'in describing permit requirements. <T3>Id. </T3>at section 1260(5)(A). This court will not presume to definethese terms, but the use of different words does connote an intent to prescribea different meaning.'' (<T3>In Re: Permanent II, </T3>Slip op. at 31.) Thus, separate definitionsof these two terms are required by the court's decision if they are neededto conform the OSMRE regulations with Congressional intent.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Legislative History </ITAG>To determine Congressional intent OSMRE reexamined the legislative historyof the Act as it relates to AVFs. Based on the statutory language and onthe legislative history of section 510(b)(5) of the Act, OSMRE has concludedthat separate definitions are appropriate. Congress used the term ``agricultural activities'' in section 701(1) ofthe Act in defining ``alluvial valley floors.'' The term ``farming'' wasused in section 510(b)(5)(A) of the Act in the AVF permit finding provision,which provides a higher standard of protection to a more limited numberof AVFs than provided in the performance standards of section 515(b)(10)of the Act. In an attempt to strike a balance between the need to preservethe productive use of AVFs and the need to recover coal beneath them, Congressintended sections 510(b)(5) of the Act to protect only those AVFs whichsupport farming, but not those which support other agricultural activitiesand are protected by section 515(b)(10)(F) of the Act. Early versions of section 510(b)(5)(A) of the Act would have applied toranching as well as farming on AVFs. Both the House and Senate bills atone time prohibited the regulatory authority from approving a permit unlessit found that the proposed surface coal mining operation, if located westof the 100th meridian west longitude, would ``not have a substantial adverseeffect on valley floors * * * where farming can be practiced * * * (excludingundeveloped range lands), where such valley floors are significant to ** * <T3>farming and ranching operations </T3>* * *.'' H.R. Rep No. 45, 94thCong., 1st Sess. 22 (1975) (Reporting accompanying H.R. 25); S. Rep. No.128, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 20 (1977) (Report accompanying S. 7) (Emphasisadded.) Additionally, both bills extended this prohibition to potentialas well as present farming and ranching. The language extending the coverage to ``ranching operations'' was deletedby the House in 1976 and by the Senate in 1977. After H.R. 25 was reportedout in 1975, a controversy arose concerning the scope of section 510(b)(5).In the next session the House adopted language very similar to the provisionthat was finally enacted on August 3, 1977. It provided that the regulatoryauthority could not approve the permit unless it found that the operationwould not ``interrupt, discontinue, or prevent <T3>farming </T3>on alluvial valley floors, * * * but, excluding undevelopedrange lands * * * and those lands as to which the regulatory authorityfinds that if the <T3>farming </T3>that will be interrupted * * * is of such small acreageas to be of negligible impact on the <T3>farm's agricultural production </T3>* * *.'' Section 510(b)(5) of the1976 House bill also contained a provision grandfathering certain operationswhich existed prior to the enactment of the Act. See H.R. Rep. No. 896,94th Cong., 2nd Sess. 2 (1976) (Report accompanying H.R. 9725). Although the deletion of the term ``ranching'' was not specifically discussed,the debates on the floor indicated that the Congress amended the AVF permitfinding provision largely in response to the Administration's concern thatthe provision in the 1975 House bill could be read to ``close some existingmines and * * * lock up significant coal reserves.'' 121 Cong. Rec. 12958,62-64 (May 5, 1975); H.R. Rep. No. 896, 94th Cong., 2nd Sess. 3 (1976).The effect of the amendment was to increase the recoverability of coalunderlying AVFs by deleting the limitations on mining both for presentand potential ranching provided by section 510(b)(5) of the Act, and byadding the grandfather provisions and the small acreage exception. The Senate did not delete the ranching protection from the AVF permit findingprovision of its bill until May of 1977 when it passed a compromise amendmentintroduced by Senator Melcher. Senator Johnston first introduced an amendmentwhich required a finding that the operation would not interrupt, discontinueor prevent farming on AVFs unless, among other matters, ``the total valueof the coal mined * * * would exceed, by a ratio of 100 to 1, the totalvalue of the <T3>farming or ranching </T3>products that would be produced from saidacreage * * *.'' (123 Cong. Rec. S 8030, May 19, 1977) (Emphasis added.)Senator Hart then offered an amendment which would have banned all miningon AVFs irrespective of the agricultural use of the land, with a limitedgrandfather provision. (123 Cong. Rec. 15691, May 20, 1977) These two amendmentswere defeated. A third amendment, introduced by Senator Melcher and ultimately adoptedby the Senate, contained the identical language of the 1976 House bill,including the deletion of the protection for ranching, and the additionof the grandfather provision and the small acreage exemption. The Senatoremphasized that this language was designed to protect lands where therewas farming that depended on irrigation. He further stated that in 1976this language had been carefully reviewed and represented a compromiseamong environmental and labor groups, coal companies, individual landownersand government agencies. (123 Cong. Rec. 15751, May 20, 1977) The Senatorcharacterized his amendment as a ``middle ground [between the Hart andthe Johnston amendments] * * * because it does retain the restrictionson keeping the alluvial valley floor <T3>farming </T3>operations intact. But it allows enough discretion throughthe regulatory authority to allow [mining] in those instances where themining operation would not violently disturb a <T3>farming operation </T3>on a valley floor * * *.'' (123 Cong. Rec. 15752)(Emphasis added.) The legislative history of section 510(b)(5), therefore, indicated thatthe Congress twice rejected language which would have broadened the scopeof the AVF permit finding provision to encompass ranching as well as farmingactivities. OSMRE's 1983 combined definition of ``agricultural activities<T3>or </T3>farming'' therefore was inconsistent with Congressional intent.Accordingly, OSMRE has defined ``farming'' as a subset of ``agriculturalactivities'' distinct from ranching.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Definitions </ITAG>As described above, it appears from the debates leading to adoption ofthe Melcher amendment that the Congress intended to protect only thoseAVFs being farmed and not those being ranched. Therefore, in promulgatingseparate definitions of ``agricultural activities'' and ``farming'' consistentwith the legislative history it was necessary to distinguish farming fromranching. The most practical way to make the distinction is to consider``pasturing or grazing of livestock'' in the arid and semi-arid areas westof the 100th meridian as ranching, and to limit farming to activities whichinvolve raising plants. That concept is embodied in the final definitionsdescribed below. <T3>``Agricultural activities''. </T3>The definition promulgated for ``agriculturalactivities'' is similar to the remanded definition of ``agricultural activities<T3>or </T3>farming.'' However, the specific terms ``cultivation,'' ``cropping,''and ``harvesting'' found in the definition of ``agricultural activitiesor farming'' are replaced in this final rule definition by the genericterm ``farming.'' Therefore, the definition of ``agricultural activities''reads as follows: <T3>Agricultural activities </T3>means, with respect to alluvial valleyfloors, the use of any tract of land for the production of animal or vegetablelife, based on regional agricultural practices, where the use is enhancedor facilitated by subirrigation or flood irrigation. These uses include,but are not limited to, farming and the pasturing or grazing of livestock.These uses do not include agricultural activities which have no relationshipto the availability of water from subirrigation or flood irrigation practices.``<T3>Farming.</T3>'' For consistency with the definition of ``agriculturalactivities'' described above, OSMRE has defined ``farming'' in terms ofthe ``cultivation,'' ``cropping'' or ``harvesting'' of plants as follows:<T3>Farming </T3>means, with respect to alluvial valley floors, the primaryuse of those areas for the cultivation, cropping or harvesting of plantswhich benefit from irrigation, or natural subirrigation, that results fromthe increased moisture content in the alluvium of the valley floors. Forpurposes of this definition harvesting does not include the grazing oflivestock. The final definition of ``farming'' differs from the proposal by substitutingthe word ``or'' for the word ``and'' in the proposed phrase ``cultivation,cropping and harvesting.'' OSMRE made this change in response to commentsthat indicated requiring all three activities to be performed to establishthat an AVF is farmed is too restrictive One commenter pointed out thatfarming operations employing ``no-till'' practices, where little if anycultivation occurs, could be excluded by the definition. Other commentersargued that the definition would exclude native hay meadows that are mechanicallyharvested for use as winter feed, but may not be cultivated. Thus, underthe final rule, all three activities need not occur for farming to exist.For the purposes of the final rule, OSMRE intends that cultivation meansthe preparation of the land for planting, cropping means planting and tending,and harvesting means the gathering in of the crop. OSMRE also intends,for purposes of the final rule, that ``pasturing or grazing of livestock''is not a method of harvesting. The production of forage is only considereda farming activity when the forage crop is cultivated, cropped or mechanicallyharvested (i.e., cut and either stacked or baled). <T3>Farming as the ``primary use'' of an AVF. </T3>The phrase ``primaryuse'' in the definition of ``farming'' is intended to cover those AVFswhich are farmed in most years but not in others due to an unsatisfactoryyield, excess production, or some other factor. The use of an AVF for the``pasturing or grazing of livestock'' in some years does not preclude theAVF from being classified as farmed and thereby subject to the mining prohibitionunder sections 510(b)(5) of the Act. However, the ``cultivation, croppingor harvesting'' of plants constitute ``farming'' only where such activitiesare actually the primary use of an AVF. The suspended definition placedall ``cultivation, cropping or harvesting'' within the scope of ``agriculturalactivities or farming.'' This final rule differs since occasional farmingactivities on AVFs not primarily used for ``cultivation, cropping or harvesting,''and not capable of producing crops on a regular basis, are not consideredfarming. As discussed below in connection with the legislative historyof the word ``preclude'' in section 510(b)(5)(A) of the Act, a change inprimary use, from farming to some other use, will not eliminate the protectionprovided by section 510(b)(5). <T3>Plants not benefitting from irrigation or subirrigation. </T3>``Farming,''under the definition promulgated herein, is limited to those ``plants ** * which benefit from irrigation, or natural subirrigation, that resultsfrom the increased moisture content in the alluvium of the valley floors.''Therefore, although an AVF is used for the cultivation, cropping or harvestingof plants, it would not qualify as ``farmed'' if the plants being cultivated,cropped or harvested do not benefit from the irrigation or subirrigationdescribed above. 4. <T3>Effect of final rule. </T3>The chief consequence of defining ``farming''separately from ``agricultural activities'' is that whenever 30 CFR 785.19or 822.12 refer to ``farming,'' they no longer will apply to all ``agriculturalactivities,'' but only to those activities which involve the ``cultivation,cropping or harvesting'' of plants. The ``farmed'' AVF areas being affectedso as to invoke the andSection;822.12(a) prohibition can include areas whichwere not being mined but would have their ``farming'' interrupted, discontinued,or precluded by a mining operation located on a nearby portion of the sameAVF or outside the AVF. The net effect of these final rule definitionswould be to remove the prohibitions of section 510(b)(5) of the Act fromthose AVFs used for agricultural activities other than ``farming.'' However,it should be emphasized that while the scope of the mining prohibitionof section 510(b)(5) of the Act may be somewhat reduced under this finalrule, that provision of the Act and implementing regulations were neverintended to cover undeveloped rangelands not significant to farming, whichcharacterize much of the grazing land on AVFs west of the 100th meridian.Moreover, the performance standards of 30 CFR Part 822, which implementsection 515(b)(10)(F) of the Act, still apply to all AVFs allowed to besurface minded. One commenter was confused about the effect of the rule and indicated supportfor ``the proposal to make farming a prerequisite to AVF designation.''The process and criteria for AVF determination in 30 CFR 785.19(a) arenot the subject of nor are they affected by this final rule. The presenceof geologic and hydrologic characteristics determines whether an area isto be considered an AVF. All AVFs are protected by the performance standardestablished by section 515(b)(10)(F) of the Act. Whether ``farming'' maybe interrupted, discontinued or precluded on a particular AVF is only aconcern when applying the mining prohibition pursuant to section 510(b)(5)of the Act. Two commenters were concerned about the affect the rule would have on aspecific area. One stated ``OSMRE's proposed rule would substantially limitor eliminate protection for AVFs in the Alton coalfield in Utah, currentlythe subject of a permitting dispute over a mine proposed by Utah International.''The second stated the proposal ``would serve to alleviate almost all theproblems that BHP-Utah Intl., Inc. is having in convincing the Utah [regulatoryauthority] to deem complete its application for a permit to strip minecoal at Alton, Utah.''OSMRE agrees that the final rule does narrow the scope of the mining prohibitionestablished by section 510(b)(5) of the Act; however the rule does noteliminate the protection afforded AVFs pursuant to section 515(b)(10)(F)of the Act. The Alton mine permit application and any subsequent miningactivity must comply with the approved Utah regulatory program. Under primacy,the effect on the Alton application of any changes that may be made inthe Utah program pursuant to these changes in OSMRE's permanent regulatoryprogram would be evaluated by Utah, not by OSMRE. Under section 505 ofthe Act, any State program may be more stringent than the Secretary's regulations.The proposed rule interpreted the pasturing and grazing of livestock asa non-farming (ranching) agricultural activity and would have limited ``farming''to those situations where cultivation, cropping and harvesting practicesare employed. Comments were solicited on whether any other meaningful orpractical distinctions, consistent with the court order and the legislativehistory, could be made between ``agricultural activities'' and ``farming.''Of the 15 commenters, 12 opposed OSMRE's exclusion of grazing activitiesfrom the definition of ``farming'' and three favored it. Many of the opposingcomments focused on different interpretations of the legislative historyof the Act. Several commenters argued that the focus of Congressional debatewas water and its importance to Western agriculture, not agricultural productiontechniques. In relation to AVFs, they felt it is the non-AVF dependentand other non-water dependent agricultural activities that are not protectedfrom mining even if they occur on an AVF. For example, a poultry operationon an AVF would not preclude mining since its production is not enhancedby irrigation. AVFs are important due to their greater productivity, whichis a function of soils, topography and water, not a function of plantedversus native crops or mechanical versus natural harvesting (grazing).Other commenters asserted that since the bulk of Western agriculture isbeef production, not row crops, it does not make since for Congress totry to protect agricultural production without including livestock production.Many commenters attacked OSMRE's interpretation of the discussion of SenatorMelcher's amendment and argued that he was concerned about irrigation andsubirrigation in protected areas versus dry creeks, not farming versusranching. In the commenters' view, Melcher opposed a total ban on miningon AVFs because it would protect dry creeks, not because it would protectirrigated or subirrigated grazed AVFs. Thus, the commenters held the opinionthat the real issue behind the Melcher amendment was developed versus undevelopedAVF lands.OSMRE believes that this final rule is a proper and reasonable interpretationof the intent of Congress, consistent with the language of the Act andthe legislative history. Congress wanted to balance the needs of two competinginterests, agriculture and coal mining. Congress achieved that balanceby allowing mining to take place, albeit with strict performance standards,in most areas of the West. In areas important to the agricultural economy,AVFs, two levels of protection were provided: first, the preservation duringand after mining of the essential hydrologic functions of all AVFs wherewater sufficient for irrigation or subirrigation is available, and second,a prohibition of mining that would interrupt, discontinue or preclude farmingon AVFs. Congress did not forsake livestock production. On the contrary,Congress attempted to ensure the continued viability of Western livestockproducers by preserving the areas that are crucial to any Western livestockoperation, the areas where storable winter forage is produced. Livestockoperations require hay and grain crops to sustain the animals during timeswhen grazing and pasturing are ineffective, e.g. in winter or periods ofdrought. Congress protected the areas where crops can be produced thatare essential to the overall viability of such operations. The ``farmed''AVFs, as OSMRE has defined them, are the essential winter feed productionareas that, together with the surrounding grazing land, make a livestockoperation capable of sustaining itself.Congress was aware of the differences between ranching and farming. Whereit intended a provision to apply to both farming and ranching, it usedboth terms. Where it intended a provision to apply only to farming, itused the term ``farming'' alone. Thus, in section 714 of the Act, surfaceowner consent is needed from persons conducting farming or ranching operations.In section 510(b), however, only farming is covered. Therefore, the expressprotection provided for ranching is limited to where that term is used,section 714, and requires surface owner consent, but unlike section 510(b)does not prohibit mining.One commenter, responding to OSMRE's request for comments on meaningfuland practical distinctions between ``agricultural activities'' and ``farming,''indicated that ``agricultural activities'' and ``farming'' have distinctpurposes in the Act. The commenter asserted that they do not depend onone term being a subset of the other. In the commenter's view, ``agriculturalactivities'' restricts AVFs to those with a certain amount of water. ``Farming''limits the full protection of the Act to AVFs where agricultural productiontakes place, i.e., where AVF rangeland is developed or significant to agriculturalproduction and where the agricultural production dependent on the AVF issignificant to the farm's production. The commenter concluded that thedifference is that one term addresses water availability, while the otheris concerned with agricultural production.OSMRE agrees in part. The terms are used for different purposes in theAct. However, the definition of ``farming'' adopted today is consistentwith the statutory language, the legislative history and common usage.In reference to the use of the term ``undeveloped range lands'' in section510(b)(5)(A) of the Act, one commenter argued that if Congress had definedfarming as OSMRE proposed, the phrase ``undeveloped rangelands which arenot significant to farming'' would be unnecessary.OSMRE disagrees. While Congress specifically excluded undeveloped rangelands, they are not necessarily the only lands excluded from the protectionof section 510(b)(5) of the Act. Moreover, OSMRE's definition of farming,which does not include ranching, is consistent with the usage employedby Congress in another part of the Act. In section 714(e)(2), Congressdefined the term ``surface owner,'' in part, as a person or persons whoconduct farming or ranching operations upon a farm or ranch unit. Clearly,Congress considered farming and ranching to be separate activities.As discussed in more detail below, the House discussion of April 29, 1977,makes clear that the House felt that a broader amendment was needed toextend the protection of section 510(b)(5) to areas grazed by cattle andsheep. Without further amendment, H.R. 2 would only prohibit mining thoseareas currently being ``cultivated'' and not those with potential for cultivation.While such an amendment was passed by the House on that day, it did notbecome law. Instead, the language of H.R. 2 being criticized that day asproviding inadequate protection is what was ultimately passed into law.Further evidence exists to refute the commenter's assertion that the undevelopedrangeland exception in section 510(b)(5) of the Act is inconsistent withOSMRE's proposed definition of ``farming.'' In a February 1977 preparedstatement submitted in a House subcommittee hearing, then-Congressman Baucusof Montana suggested that the undeveloped rangeland exception in section510(b)(5) of H.R. 2 be eliminated. In his view, the use of land as undevelopedrangeland did not qualify as agriculture. His statement was as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">``It seems to me that the current use of land, such as `undevelopedrangeland,' is not nearly so important as the potential use of the land_weshould not render unproductive land which offers potential for agriculture.''</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(<T3>Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment of theCommittee on Interior and Insular Affairs on H.R. 2, </T3>Serial No. 95-1,Part III, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., 161 (February 24, 1977)). Thus the commenteris wrong to suggest that inclusion of the exception for undeveloped rangelandrequires OSMRE to conclude that farming must include a land use that atleast one member of the House did not even consider to be agriculture.Nothing in the definition of ``farming'' is inconsistent with the languageof section 510(b)(5) of the Act. Likewise, the language of the Act doesnot preclude a definition such as the one adopted today, which is consistentwith the legislative history.One commenter, who felt that Congress wanted to protect developed AVFsas distinct from undeveloped range lands rather than farming as distinctfrom ranching, suggested that undeveloped range lands be defined as grazingland which is not irrigated or naturally subirrigated and has not beendeveloped to enhance or facilitate agricultural production.The definition of ``undeveloped range lands'' in 30 CFR 701.5 was not apart of proposed rulemaking. Currently, ``undeveloped range lands'' aredefined, for the purposes of AVFs, as lands where the use is not specificallycontrolled and managed. OSMRE does not agree with the commenter's interpretationof the legislative history. The suggested change would define ``undevelopedrange lands'' in an inappropriately narrow manner in relation to irrigationor subirrigation and would inject ambiguity into the definition due tothe lack of any clear meaning for the word ``developed.''One commenter highlighted the following excerpts from a discussion betweenRepresentatives Udall and Johnson (of Colorado) concerning an amendmentto H.R. 2 offered by Representative Baucus as evidence that Congress wantedto prohibit mining on grazing areas in AVFs (123 Cong. Rec. 12866, April29, 1977):``<T3>Mr. Udall: </T3>We do not protect the whole valley; we protect thevalley floor. In most cases, this comprises a hundred yards. This is thesubterranean stream, or this is where the alfalfa and forage crops areraised.``<T3>Mr. Johnson: </T3>[T]here will not be any farming operations whichare interrupted except for that one narrow exception that I pointed outearlier. This would essentially stop mining in areas that are presentlybeing grazed by cattle and sheep . . . is that not correct?``<T3>Mr. Udall: </T3>[I]f it is in the valley floor itself, then there wouldbe a ban in the valley floor.''The commenter indicated that the second sentence of Mr. Johnson's remarksreferred to H.R. 2, which was the House version of the bill that was sentto the conference committee that produced the final legislation. At thattime, H.R. 2 contained an AVF provision similar to section 510(b)(5) ofthe Act.Careful scrutiny of the entire context of the quoted remarks, however,reveals that Mr. Johnson was actually referring to the Baucus amendmentas the instrument by which mining would be prohibited in grazing lands.Earlier in the same discussion, Mr. Johnson had stated, ``Why do we wantto prevent mining in areas where there is only grazing for cattle or sheep?That makes no sense to me whatever. I think the extension of the [Baucus]amendment goes too far and is not warranted.'' (123 Cong. Rec. 12865.)In support of this view is the fact that immediately following the Udall-Johnsondiscussion, Representative Jeffords of Vermont in voicing his support forthe Baucus amendment stated that ``I am aware that <T3>much of the land in question is used for cattle grazing, </T3>and isnot presently under cultivation. But the underground water systems whichwould be endangered by strip mining present a long-term potential for cropcultivation.'' (Emphasis added.) (123 Cong. Rec. 12867) It is clear thatthe Baucus amendment was intended to extend the mining prohibition beyondlands under cultivation to grazing lands, lands that were not so protectedunder H.R. 2. While this amendment passed the House following the abovecited discussion, it did not become a part of the Act. Since the confereessubsequently rejected the Baucus amendment and adopted language similarto the earlier House language, the Act does not extend the mining prohibitionto grazing lands.One commenter argued that OSMRE's statement in the proposal that deletionof the term ``ranching'' was not discussed in the legislative history lendssupport to the theory that it was an inconsequential change, not an attemptto exclude a major agricultural activity from protection. The commenterasserted that such an exclusion would not be done without explanation.In the commenter's opinion, the deletion of ``ranching'' from ``farmingand ranching operations'' was not to distinguish them, but to avoid redundancy.Similarly, a commenter said that brevity was the purpose of removing thereference to ranching because the term ``farming'' is used three timesin section 510(b)(5)(A) of the Act.In cases where a change was made to statutory language without an explanation,OSMRE is guided by the principle expounded by the Supreme Court and referencedin <T3>NWF v. Hodel, </T3>at 764, in circumstances relating to the authorityto grant variance from approximate original contour requirements. Thatis, that the plain language of the statute should be relied upon unlessthe legislative history contains a clearly expressed contrary intention.In this case, the words ``and ranching'' were deleted while, as noted above,other portions of the legislative history indicate that section 510(b)(5)as it became law was not intended to extend to grazing areas. The commenter'sassertion that reference to ranching was deleted solely for brevity isbelied by Congress' use of both farming and ranching three times in section714(e)(2) of the Act. Thus, when Congress wished to include ranching, itdid so expressly. Therefore, OSMRE may conclude properly that ranchingwas deleted to reduce the scope of the protection rather than to eliminateredundancy or to be brief.One commenter who opposed OSMRE's proposal suggested that any distinctionbetween farming and ranching as the terms are used in the West is cultural.For example, a large operation involving wheat production can be referredto as a wheat ranch. The commenter argued that lacking a statutory definitionof ranching, it is logical to consult a dictionary, e.g. Webster's, whichdefines a ranch as a Western term meaning a large farm for the raisingof cattle, horses or sheep or any large farm devoted to the raising ofa particular crop or livestock.While Webster's may define ranching as a Western U.S. subset of its globaldefinition of farming, the two terms do have distinctly different meaningsto farmers and ranchers of the arid and semiarid West. Farming is generallythought of as crop production associated with supplemental irrigation.Grain production without supplemental irrigation is as apt to be calleddry farming as wheat ranching, depending on locality. The definition of``farming'' adopted today is consistent with these practices and protectsthe irrigated areas used for stored forage production associated with cattleranches.Other commenters opposed the proposed definition of ``farming'' for reasonsunrelated to the legislative history of the Act. Many commenters opposedthe proposed change to the definition of ``farming'' because they believedit would remove from protection much of the AVF acreage in the West, wasa rollback of protection for AVFs, ignored regional agricultural practices,would not protect grazed AVFs that are significant to farming, and wouldresult in an illogical granting and denying of permits. In contrast, anothercommenter indicated that ``using the [proposed] definitions, * * * therewould be almost no changes in the AVF determinations already made in Wyoming.[T]he impact of the proposed definitions would be relatively minimal inour State.''OSMRE does not agree with the opposing commenters. Pursuant to section515(b)(10)(F) of the Act, surface coal mining operations are required topreserve the essential hydrologic functions of <T3>all </T3>Western AVFs as defined in the Act. This rule in no way affectsor diminishes that protection. This rule does affect the scope of the prohibitionon mining ``farmed'' AVFs pursuant to secton 510(b)(5) of the Act to theextent that it will be incorporated into State programs. As noted, in thecase of Wyoming, it may have relatively little impact. Although opposedby some commenters, the final definition of ``farming'' adopted today isconsistent with the intent of Congress and the statutory language, as discussedabove.One commenter argued that the definition would have ludicrous consequencesin practice: If hay planted on an AVF is baled and fed to cattle in thefield, the AVF would be protected, yet if the same cattle ate the samehay in the same field before it was baled, the AVF would not be protected.While the commenter is partially correct in his representation of the effectof this rule, he misstates the issue. Contrary to the commenter's assertion,all AVFs are protected by the performance standards of 30 CFR Part 822.The issue is not whether protection exists, but rather is for what AVFsthe prohibition on mining will apply. Because of the more limited areasavailable for producing storable forage necessary for a successful livestockoperation, the higher level of protection of such areas afforded by a miningprohibition is far more critical to the overall production of a given agriculturalunit than affording such protection to areas merely being grazed in season.In the opinion of several commenters, applying the special protection toAVFs based on past or current agricultural practices does not address thestatutory requirement in section 510(b)(5)(A) of the Act that mining notpreclude (future) farming. Another commenter wanted to add to the definitionof ``farming'' a statement to the effect that to be considered ``farmed''an area would have to have been ``historically used for cropland.'' Inthe commenter's opinion, this would eliminate the need for the ``primaryuse'' concept in the definition, a concept that ``could be subject to differentinterpretations.''OSMRE does not agree with these commenters. Under the Act, the specialprotection of section 510(b)(5) is only applied to AVFs significant tofarming. That provision requires that the primary use of the land, eithercurrently or in the past, be farming. Inclusion of the word ``preclude''supports this interpretation and was discussed in the final House-Senateconference report on H.R. 2. The conferees stated, ``[t]he phrase `notinterrupt, discontinue or prevent farming' was modified to `not interrupt,discontinue or preclude farming' in order to assure coverage of those landswhich may be taken out of agricultural production in order to qualify fora new mine start on an alluvial valley floor. The conferees did not wantthis type of change in land-use to qualify an alluvial floor for mining.''H.R. 95-493, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 104 (July 12, 1977). This statementindicates that there had to have been pre-existing farm use. The Jeffordsdiscussion cited earlier lends additional support to this position. Thephrase ``primary use'' in the definition of ``farming'' is intended tocover those AVFs which are farmed in most years, but not in others dueto an unsatisfactory yield, excess production or some other factor. Theconcepts of ``primary use'' and ``historical use'' mesh in that the regulatoryauthority should examine the facts and determine whether the primary useof the land in the past had been farming.The response to the commenter's concern that a regualtory authority determinationof primary use may be subject to varying interpretations is that the potentialfor varying interpretations exists in any discretionary determination bythe regulatory authority. The safeguard is that the permitting processrequires public participation to assist the regulatory authority in makingthe decision and, under section 514 of the Act, any adversely affectedperson may petition for administrative review.One commenter, a landowner, argued that in his case some meadows are hayedin high rainfall years (rare) and grazed in years of low rainfall (frequent).He asserted that the proposal makes application of the special protectiondependent on a factor beyond the control of the farm or ranch operator.OSMRE intends that the determination of which AVFs are covered by the miningprohibition will be made by the regulatory authority on a case-by-casebasis based, in part, on whether the primary use of the area is farming.The same landowner also argued that to obtain the special protection, acrop would have to be harvested instead of grazed. Such a forced changecould affect the profitability of agricultural operations.This rule does not require landowners to engage in any practice, profitableor not. The final rule was changed from the proposal so that the prohibitionwill apply if the land is cropped or cultivated, regardless of whetherharvesting occurs. If the landowner chooses not to engage in cropping,cultivation or harvesting, the protection of section 515(b)(10) of theAct will still apply.One commenter argued that AVFs should be defined by geological and hydrologicalparameters, not according to the changing practices of man.OSMRE agrees in part. Under the Act and the permanent program regulations,AVF identification and protection is related to geological and hydrologicalparameters, including the availability of water. Such availability maybe enhanced by irrigation. However, the applicability of the prohibitionon mining is applied consistent with the intent of Congress that AVFs significantto farming not be mined.Two landowners were concerned about the impact of mining on downstreamunmined AVFs. One asserted that if a grazed AVF is mined, downstream farmedAVFs would be damaged.OSMRE shares the landowners' concern about potential damage to ``farmed''AVFs as a result of mining operations on non-``farmed'' AVFs and otherareas. In such circumstances the mining prohibition would apply. The protectionprovided by the performance standard at 30 CFR 822.12(a), which prohibitsmining operations from interrupting, discontinuing or precluding farmingon AVFs or causing material damage to the quality or quantity of waterin surface or underground water systems that supply AVFs, is not limitedby distance from or spatial relationship to the mining operation. Downstreameffects of mining operations will be considered by the regulatory authorityin the permitting process.In addition to the comments on the definition of ``farming'' discussedabove, OSMRE received a large number of comments suggesting specific languageto be used in the definitions of both ``agricultural activities'' and ``farming.''Many of these suggestions would have had the effect of including grazingin the definition of ``farming.'' Such a definition of the word ``farming''would not be consistent with the statutory language and the intent of Congress,for the reasons discussed above, and the comments were not accepted.One commenter suggested deleting the phrase ``where the use is enhancedor facilitated by subirrigation or flood irrigation'' and the entire lastsentence from the proposed definition of ``agricultural activities.'' Thesame commenter wanted to delete the phrase ``which benefit from irrigation,or natural subirrigation, that results from the increased moisture contentin the alluvium of the valley floors'' from the proposed definition of``farming.'' The commenter felt that these changes were desirable becausethe relationship between agricultural activities and irrigation is coveredin the Act.OSMRE did not accept these comments. Because the relationship between agriculturalactivities and irrigation or natural subirrigation is specified in theAct, it is important and appropriate to carry the relationship over intothe regulatory definitions for clarity and consistency.One commenter opined that there was no support in the record for harvestingbeing limited to mechanical harvesting, nor for mechanical harvesting meaningnot just ``swathing,'' but also either stacking or baling.As discussed above, OSMRE believes that the legislative history supportsexcluding grazing from the definition of ``farming.'' Therefore, directharvesting by animals, that is, pasturing and grazing, is not consideredharvesting under the rule. Since Congress intended to prohibit mining inareas where storable winter forage is produced, harvesting must consistof cutting (``swathing'') <T3>and</T3> preparing the crop for storage by stacking or baling, or forgrain production, placing the grain in storage.B. Section 701.5 Definition of ``materially damage the quantity or qualityof water.''As required by the district court in <T3>In Re: Permanent II,</T3> slip op. at 31, and for conformity with theamended definitions of ``agricultural activities'' and ``farming,'' OSMREhas also amended the definition of ``Materially damage the quantity orquality of water'' by substituting the term ``farming'' for the term ``agriculturalactivities.'' The revised definition reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Materially damage the quantity or quality of water</T3> means, withrespect to alluvial valley floors, to degrade or reduce by surface coalmining and reclamation operations the water quantity or quality suppliedto the alluvial valley floor to the extent that resulting changes wouldsignificantly decrease the capability of the alluvial valley floor to supportfarming.</ITAG>The final definition is unchanged from the proposed rule. Based on OSMRE'spreviously discussed review of the statutory language and legislative historyof the Act to include only farming and not ranching, and the decision ofthe district court in <T3>In Re: Permanent II,</T3> the material damage finding required by section510(b)(5)(B) of the Act applies only to AVFs which support ``farming.''Therefore, the definition of material damage should be, and is, limitedto decreases in the capability of those AVFs to support ``farming'' insteadof all ``agricultural activities.'' The result of this change is to eliminatethe mining prohibition, but not the protection under section 515(b)(10)(F)of the Act, for AVFs primarily used for non-farming agricultural activitiessuch as grazing which were covered under the previous rule.One commenter suggested that the definition of material damage should relateto the premining condition of the land, which can be documented and compared,and recommended defining material damage in terms of adverse impacts onpre-existing vegetation or changes limiting the adequacy of water for irrigation.OSMRE did not accept this comment because it is not tied to the protectionprovided by section 510(b)(5) of the Act. The material damage finding requiredby section 510(b)(5)(B) of the Act applies only to AVFs which support ``farming.''The definition of material damage should be, and is, limited to decreasesin the capability of those AVFs to support ``farming'' instead of all ``agriculturalactivities'' or pre-existing vegetation. To the extent that mining wouldlimit the adequacy of water for for irrigation, the capability of the AVFto support farming would most likely be decreased.One commenter was concerned that use of the term ``alluvial valley floors''in 30 CFR 785.19(e)(2)(ii) and 822.12(a)(2) could give the erroneous impressionthat <T3>all</T3> AVFs, not just those significant to farming, are subject tothe regulatory requirements of section 510(b)(5) of the Act. The commentersuggested that OSMRE preclude any possible confusion by providing a clearstatement in the final rule to the effect that the use of the term ``alluvialvalley floors'' in the cited regulations refers only to ``farmed'' AVFs.The protection provided by the definition of ``materially damage the quantityor quality of water'' is clearly limited to those areas whose primary usesare or have been farming. Therefore, no further clarification in the regulationsis necessary.C. Section 785.19(b) Applicability of statutory exclusionsRevisions also were needed to conform existing 30 CFR 785.19(b) to theproposed definition of ``agricultural activities'' and ``farming.'' Section785.19(b)(2) is unchanged from the proposed rule and provides for miningon AVFs under two of the section 510(b)(5) statutory exclusions describedabove. The first exclusion applies to undeveloped rangelands which arenot significant to farming; the second exclusion applies to mining whenthe regulatory authority finds that mining activities would affect farmingof ``such small acreage as to be of negligible impact on the farm's agriculturalproduction.'' Final andSection; 785.19(b)(2)(ii) requires the regulatoryauthority to base its determination of whether an impact was ``negligible''on the relationship between the loss of production from the affected farmlandareas to the farm's total agricultural production over the life of themine.This final provision includes several changes, but remains very similarto the 1983 final rule. Because this paragraph deals with the impact ofsurface coal mining on ``farming'' and the final definition of ``farming''does not include the use of AVFs for grazing, OSMRE has deleted the referenceto grazing in andSection; 785.19(b)(2)(ii). Further, because the use of AVFsfor hay production falls within the final definition of ``farming'' aspreviously discussed, this paragraph has been reorganized and the term``hayed AVF area'' deleted.Two other editorial changes also have been made for clarity and consistencywith the final definition of ``farming.'' First, the word ``total'' hasbeen added as a modifier to the term ``agricultural production'' to emphasizethat the basis by which any impact is measured is a farm's total agriculturalproduction. Second, the phrase ``vegetation and water of the developedgrazed or hayed alluvial valley floor area'' has been changed to ``farmlandareas'' because the former could be construed to be related to areas whichare not farmed under the final definition of ``farming.'' The use of ``farmlandareas'' is consistent with terms found in existing andSection; 785.19(b)(3).One commenter suggested that andSection;785.19(b)(2)(i) should begin ``Anyfarming on the irrigated or naturally subirrigated AVF * * *'' rather thanjust ``Any farming on the AVF * * *.''This comment was not accepted. It is not necessary to insert ``irrigatedor naturally subirrigated'' in the subparagraph since the words are alreadypresent in the definition of AVF.One commenter was concerned about the use of the term ``agricultural production''in two places in andSection; 785.19(b)(2)(ii). The commenter believed thatthe term is intended to mean ``farming'' production and suggested thatOSMRE clearly state this in the final rule. A second commenter also opposedcomparing impact on ``farmed'' AVFs to total agricultural production becauseto do so would allow inclusion of thousands of acres of non-AVF land, dilutingthe relative impact of mining on the AVFs. This commenter urged that thedetermination of impact should compare ``farmed'' AVFs to ``the productionof only the AVF portion of the farm or ranch.'' In contrast, one commenterfound ``considerable support'' in the legislative history for the positionthat the impact of mining should be based on total agricultural production,not on the impact to areas solely used for farming. Another commentor objectedto the insertion of the word ``total'' as an unwarranted deviation fromthe statutory language.In applying the statutory exclusion of section 510(b)(5)(A) of the Act,which also uses the term ``agricultural production,'' OSMRE has consistentlyinterpreted the comparison to consist of the relative importance of theaffected ``farmed'' AVF on the entire farming operation. For this reason,OSMRE added the clarifying adjective ``total'' to ``agricultural production''in this paragraph. The need for clarity in this instance is demonstratedby the above comments. Because the farmed AVF may contribute a very criticalelement (stored forage) from a small portion of the total acreage, thecomparison must be to the agricultural unit as a whole including non-AVFareas.Several commenters argued that the phrase ``vegetation and water of thedeveloped, grazed or hayed AVF area'' should not be changed to ``farmlandareas'' because to do so would ignore the importance of water to productionand restrict the measurement of importance of the mined AVF area to thefarm's production to the acreage disturbed. One commenter objected to ``farmlandareas'' because he believed the resources, i.e., water and vegetation,rather than the land area are the important elements of AVFs.OSMRE does not agree. The exception in the Act forcuses on the impact onagricultural production of the interruption of farming on the AVF. It isnot necessary to specify the interrupted elements, such as water or vegetation.Reference to water and vegetation was deleted because it could be construedas applying to areas not ``farmed.'' Because this paragraph deals withthe impact of surface coal mining on ``farming,'' and the final definitionof ``farming'' does not include the use of AVFs for grazing, the referenceto grazing was deleted from the paragraph. Also, since the use of AVFsfor hay production falls within the definition of ``farming,'' the term``hayed AVF area'' is not necessary and has been deleted.One commenter was concerned about the impact of the proposed definitionsin terms of reclamation requirements. In the commenter's opinion, it maynot be sufficient to require that a previously grazed or hayed AVF simplybe reclaimed to a suitable postmining land use; it may be more appropriateto require restoration of the essential hydrologic functions of the AVF.OSMRE agrees. The reclamation performance standards found in 30 CFR 822.11require the re-establishment of the essential hydrologic functions of anAVF within the permit area, as well as the preservation of those functionsoutside the permit area. This performance standard is unchanged by theadoption of this final rule.Four commenters were concerned about how the determination of negligibleimpact is to be made. All opposed measuring the impact of mining over thelife of the mine. They believed that the use of a long period of time,such as the life of a mine (which may exceed 40 years), as opposed to thebond liability period (a minimum of ten years) or annual measurement, wouldresult in more ``farmed'' AVFs being mined with the possible concomitantelimination of farms.OSMRE believes that a time frame needs to be defined to measure the impactand that the expected life of mine is the most reasonable and accurateone. Consideration of impacts over such an extended period will reduceerrors in measurement associated with normal expected fluctuations in afarm's annual output. The foregoing notwithstanding, OSMRE intends thata primary criterion to be applied by the regulatory authority in determiningthe impact of mining on farming operations on AVFs is preservation of theviability of the farming operation. This position is consistent with theintent of Congress. Therefore, the determination should be made on a case-by-casebasis. The regulatory authority does have the flexibility to adopt a shortertime frame if, based on local conditions, imposition of such a provisionis no less effective than this rule or if the regulatory authority wishesto establish more stringent protections.Final andSection; 785.19(b)(3) is unchanged from the proposed rule and definesa farm as a land unit on which farming is conducted. The requirements ofthis section are the same as those in the suspended rule except that theterm ``farming'' has been substituted for the term ``agricultural activities.''This revision has been made to conform this paragraph with section 510(b)(5)of the Act, as well as with the final definition of ``farming.''D. Section 785.19(d)(2)(i) Information on the essential hydrologic functionsof alluvial valley floorsThe district court in <T3>In Re: Permanent II, </T3>slip op. at 38-40, remanded 30 CFR 785.19(d)(2)(i)to the Secretary to provide guidance to operators and regulatory authoritiesas to what type of information was required. Section 785.19(d) (2) and(3) of the 1979 rules had included specific information requirements todescribe the characteristics which support the essential hydrologic functionsof alluvial valley floors. Those specific information requirements hasbeen deleted from andSection; 785.19(d) when it was revised in 1983. Theappeals court ``affirm[ed] the remand so that the Secretary may provideappropriate, official guidance to the operators and regulatory authorities,or conversely, explain why such guidance is not needed. <T3>NWF v. Hodel, </T3>at 731.The special protections afforded to AVFs by the Act are described in twosections: Section 510(b)(5) prohibits a regulatory authority from approvinga permit unless the applicant submits information which affirmatively demonstratesthat certain protections to farming on AVFs are provided. Section 515(b)(10)(F)requires the preservation throughout mining and reclamation of the ``essentialhydrologic functions'' of AVFs. In section 515(b)(10)(F) the Congress identifiedspecial protections to be afforded all AVFs independent of the protectionsfor farming on alluvial valley floors provided by section 510(b)(5).The court of appeals upheld the Secretary's view that the protection ofessential hydrologic functions extended to all alluvial valley floors ratherthan just those significant to farming. The court stated that ``it seemsentirely plausible * * * that Congress intended * * * to protect all alluvialvalley floors in arid and semi-arid areas with a performance standard whilealso providing special protection at the permit stage for those alluvialvalley floors significant to farming.'' <T3>NWF v. Hodel </T3>at 747. The court went on to say that ``[a]lthoughthe legislative history cited by Industry clearly supports the notion thatCongress intended special protection for farms dependent on alluvial valleyfloors, it does nothing to refute the notion that other alluvial valleyfloors are also subject to protection, <T3>albeit not at the permitting stage.'' </T3>(Emphasis added.) This isconsistent with the fact that the Act requires no permitting informationon the essential hydrologic functions of AVFs.Although the Act does not require any permit information on essential hydrologicfunctions, and does not require the Secretary to further elaborate or ``fleshout'' this performance standard, it remains within the Secretary's discretionto add corresponding permit information requirements. <T3>NWF v. Hodel, </T3>at 734-5. Therefore, OSMRE has decided to continueto require permit information relative to preserving and reestablishingthe essential hydrologic functions of all AVFs. The information requirementfound in this final rule, which differs from that required under the 1979and 1983 rules, is described below.In the 1979 rules OSMRE regulated the protection of essential hydrologicfunctions in three ways: First, by promulgating at 30 CFR 701.5 an extensivedefinition of ``essential hydrologic functions'' which read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>``Essential hydrologic functions </T3>means the role of an alluvialvalley floor in collecting, storing, regulating, and making the naturalflow of surface or ground water, or both, usefully available for agriculturalactivities by reason of the valley floor's topographic position, the landscapeand the physical properties of its underlying materials.

(44 FR 15375-6, March 13, 1979).In 1983, OSMRE revised the AVF rules with respect to essential hydrologicfunctions in four ways: First, the definition of ``essential hydrologicfunctions'' was shortened and simplified to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>``Essential hydrologic functions</T3> means the role of an alluvialvalley floor in collecting, storing, regulating, and making the naturalflow of surface or ground water, or both, usefully available for agriculturalactivities by reason of the valley floor's topographic position, the landscape,and the physical properties of its underlying materials. A combinationof these functions provides a water supply during extended periods of lowprecipitation.''</ITAG>Second, the andSection;822.11 performance standards were rewritten to relate<T3>directly to protection of the essential hydrologic functions,</T3>rather than to the ``geologic, hydrologic, and biologic characteristicsthat support those functions.'' In pertinent part, andSection;822.11 wasrevised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">(a) The operator * * * shall minimize disturbances to the hydrologicbalance by preserving * * * the essential hydrologic functions of an alluvialvalley floor not within the permit area.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The operator * * * shall minimize disturbances to the hydrologicbalance within the permit area by reestablishing * * * the essential hydrologicfunctions of alluvial valley floors.</ITAG>Third, former paragraph andSection;822.11(c) containing the cross referenceto andSection;785.19(d)(3), which specified the detailed information requirementsto describe those ``geologic, hydrologic, and biologic'' characteristics,was removed. (48 FR 29820, June 28, 1983)And fourth, the andSection;785.19(d) permitting requirements were revised.That revision removed (1) the detailed information requirements previouslycontained in andSection;785.19(d)(2), which primarily related to the useof an alluvial valley floor for farming; and (2) andSection;785.19(d)(3),which required detailed information describing those geologic, hydrologic,and biologic characteristics necessary to support the essential hydrologicfunctions. See 48 FR 29820 (June 28, 1983). The 1983 revision of andSection;785.19(d)(2)(i)did retain, however, the requirement for detailed survey and baseline datato determine those characteristics of alluvial valley floors necessaryto preserve the essential hydrologic functions, but did not specify whatthose surveys and baseline data should address.In its October 1, 1984, decision, the district court in <T3>In Re: Permanent II</T3> remanded andSection;785.19(d)(2)(i) to the Secretaryto provide guidance as to what type of information would satisfy this requirementin the absence of previous andSection;785.19(d)(3). Slip op. at 39-40. Althoughthe court of appeals noted the deletions of both andSection;785.19(d)(2)and andSection;785.19(d)(3) (<T3>NWF v. Hodel,</T3> at 729, note 51), only the deletion of previousandSection;785.19(d)(3), which specified permit information requirementsto describe those characteristics which support the essential hydrologicfunctions, was the subject to the district court remand. Therefore, thescope of this rulemaking is limited to providing the necessary degree ofguidance as to what information must be submitted on the permit applicationto describe the essential hydrologic functions of alluvial valley floors,and to explaining the deviation from the requirements of andSection;785.19(d)(3)of the 1979 rules. Since the 1983 changes to the information requirementscontained in andSection;785.19(d)(2) of the 1979 rules were not related tothe characteristics supporting essential hydrologic functions, and werenot covered by the district court remand, this rule does not address them.In light of the court of appeals decision upholding the district courtremand of andSection; 785.19(d)(2)(i) to the Secretary the further guidance,OSMRE has reconsidered the requirements of that section and has made asubstantial revision. Since this rule addresses those permit applicationinformation requirements necessary for a regulatory authority to determineprojected compliance with the performance standards, the information requirementis structured to support the definition of essential hydrologic functionsat 30 CFR 701.5 and the performance standard requiring their protectionat 30 CFR 822.11, as they exist today. Since the performance standard nolonger is written in terms of the characteristics which support the essentialhydrologic functions, it is inappropriate to return to the informationrequirements previously contained in andSection; 785.19(d)(3), which waswritten in terms of those ``characteristics.'' Instead, final andSection;785.19(d)(2)(i) is structured to reflect the revised definition of essentialhydrologic functions and the performance standard requiring direct protectionor restoration of those functions. Final andSection; 785.19(d)(2)(i) expands upon the 1983 rule and identifiesthose specific requirements for AVF information that must be included ina permit application. It requires the applicant to include in the applicationspecified information on essential hydrologic functions of the AVF. Aneditorial change has been made to the final rule in response to a comment.The word ``evaluate'' has been substituted for the word ``identify'' inthe proposed sentence that began, ``The information required by this subparagraphshall <T3>identify </T3>those factors which contribute. * * *'' Use of the word``evaluate'' more accurately conveys the nature of the information to besubmitted. The applicant shall not just identify the factors involved,but shall also evaluate their effects and interactions.  OSMRE believes that the detailed language added to final andSection; 785.19(d)(2)(i)(A)through (D), although different from the information required under andSection;785.19(d)(3) of the March 13, 1979 rule, provides the necessary guidanceto operators and regulatory authorities, consistent with the revised definitionand performance standards. This final rule has an emphasis different fromthe 1983 rule, which contained requirements to provide information on thosecharacteristics of AVFs necessary to support their essential hydrologicfunctions. OSMRE has made this change since the performance standard isno longer structured around those characteristics, but is now built aroundthe essential hydrologic functions themselves, and those factors relatedto the AVF that contribute to them. Therefore, OSMRE has revised 30 CFR785.19(d)(2)(i)(A) through (D) as described below to specify those functionsof AVFs for which information is required in a permit application. Paragraph A is identical to the proposed rule and requires a descriptionof those factors contributing to the collection of water within the AVF,such as the amount, rate and frequency of rainfall and runoff, surfaceroughness, slope and vegetative cover, infiltration and evapotranspiration,relief, and slope and density of drainage channels. Paragraph B is identical to the proposed rule and requires a descriptionof those factors contributing to storing of water within the AVF, suchas permeability, infiltration, depth and direction of ground water flow,porosity, and water holding capacity. Paragraph C is identical to the proposed rule and requires a descriptionof those factors contributing to regulation of the flow of surface andground water within the AVF, such as longitudinal profile and slope ofthe valley and channels, the sinuosity and cross sections of the channels,interchange of water between streams and associated alluvial and bedrockaquifers, and rates and amount of water supplied by the aquifers. Paragraph D is identical to the proposed rule and requires a descriptionof those factors contributing to the availability of water in the AVF,such as the presence of floodplains and terraces suitable for agriculturalactivities. One commenter objected to OSMRE's decision to continue to require permitinformation relative to preserving <T3>and re-establishing </T3>the essential hydrologic functions of AVFs.The commenter felt that the decision represents an unwarranted broadeningof 30 CFR 785.19(d)(2)(i), which seeks only information required to determinewhat is necessary to ``preserve'' the essential hydrologic functions. Inthe commenter's view, section 515(b)(10)(F) of the Act speaks only in termsof ``preserving'' essential hydrologic functions; therefore, to speak of``preserving and re-establishing'' goes beyond the intent of Congress.OSMRE has not changed the final rule preamble to respond to the commenter'sconcern. The words ``and re-establishing'' are intended to convey the ideathat disruption of the essential hydrologic functions of the AVFs beingmined is not precluded by the final rule. This usage parallels the existingperformance standards in 30 CFR 822.11, which address the preservationof the essential hydrologic functions of AVFs outside the permit area andthe re-establishment of those functions within the permit area. This finalrule is supported by the legislative history of the Act which recognizesthat the essential hydrologic functions of the actual operating area ofa mine will be dewatered during mining (H. Rept. 95-218, 95th Cong., 1stSess. 110 (1977)). One commenter was dissatisfied with the proposal and indicated that thepreamble spent a great deal of time explaining its change of the term ``characteristics''to ``factors,'' without remedying the problem which the district courtidentified with the previous rule, namely, that the detailed requirementsof the 1980 rules of 30 CFR 785.19(d)(3) and 822.11(c) were dropped withoutadequate explanation. In the commenter's opinion, the proposed rule andpreamble fail to explain why OSMRE's new list of ``factors'' is betterthan the more detailed previous list of characteristics. The commenternoted that the 1983 rule was remanded in part because the Secretary didnot explain why the previously needed information was no longer necessary.This commenter and two others urged a reinstatement of the 1979 rule. In contrast, another commenter argued that OSMRE had gone too far. Thecommenter believed that the specification of information to be includedin permit applications is an unwarranted intrusion into the role of theregulatory authorities and an unwise limitation on their flexibility. Thecommenter recommended that the final rule leave the decision on what informationis to be submitted to the discretion of the regulatory authority. OSMRE did not accept these comments. First of all, the performance standardis no longer what it was in 1979 and, therefore, it would be inappropriateto build permit information requirements around characteristics that arenot necessarily part of the performance standard. On the other hand, whileit is true that the Act requires no permit information on essential hydrologicfunctions, and the appeals court noted that essential hydrologic functionsare not provided the same level of protection at the permitting stage asfarmed AVFs (<T3>NWF v. Hodel</T3> at 746-7), OSMRE believes it is necessary that anevaluation of the essential hydrologic functions for all AVFs be containedin the permit application so that the impact of mining and the effectivenessor reclamation can be evaluated. Thus, the rule is not an unwarranted intrusioninto State authority. The word ``factor'' is used rather than the word``characteristic'' to be more consistent with the revised performance standardand make clear that it is the essential hydrologic functions themselvesthat are to be described rather than the characteristics of the valleythat supports those functions. One commenter argued that the specific permit information requirementsin 30 CFR 785.19(d)(2)(i) should include information on the quality ofwater in the AVF because water quality is an integral part of essentialhydrologic functions. The commenter suggested adding a subparagraph (E)to describe factors contributing to the quality of water in the AVF, includingdescriptions of premining quality of surface water and of contributinggroundwater aquifers. OSMRE considered, but did not adopt, the suggestion to include water qualityinformation requirements in this rule. Because water quality informationfor surface water and groundwater is required for both surface and undergroundmine permits in other parts of the permanent regulatory program (30 CFR780.21 and 784.14 respectively), adoption of the suggestion would be unnecessarilyduplicative. <ITAG tagnum="81">Effects in Federal Program States and on Indian Lands</ITAG>The final rules are applicable through cross-referencing in those Stateswith Federal programs. This includes California, Georgia, Idaho, Massachusetts,Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee,and Washington. The Federal programs for these States appear at 30 CFRParts 905, 910, 912, 921, 922, 933, 937, 939, 941, 942, and 947, respectively.The rule will also apply through cross-referencing in 30 CFR Part 750 tosurface mining and reclamation operations on Indian lands. In the proposal,OSMRE specifically requested comment as to whether unique conditions existin any of these Federal program States or on Indian lands which shouldbe reflected either as changes to the national rules or as State-specificamendments to any or all of the Federal programs or the Indian lands program.No comments were received in response to this request. <ITAG tagnum="81">Effects of the Rule on State Programs</ITAG>Following promulgation of this rule, OSMRE will evaluate State programsto determine whether any changes in these programs will be necessary.
