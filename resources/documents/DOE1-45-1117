The NATOdecision was met by a determined Soviet effort to prevent the deploymentof the new missiles. The Soviet effort consisted of negotiations, diplomaticpropaganda, and covert measures. When it was clear that the deploymentwas not going to be stopped, the Soviets agreed to formal INF arms-reductiontalks. It is this author's opinion that the Soviet negotiation tactics,during the INF talks, supported the long-range goal of reducing the militaryeffectiveness of NATO, and also supported the goal of reducing U.S. influencein Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
