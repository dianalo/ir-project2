Nova's earnings have been hurt in the past year byfaltering petrochemical prices and heavy interest costsassociated with its 1988 acquisition of Polysar Energy andamp;Chemical Corp. Mr. Blair said Nova doesn't believe itsdepressed share price reflects the value of its stake inHusky.   In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Nova sharesclosed at C$7.875, about C$1 above its 52-week low and welloff its 52-week high of C$12.125.   Calgary-based Husky, which had 1989 reserves of about 256million barrels of crude oil or gas liquids, and 1.6 trillioncubic feet of natural gas, was taken private in 1986, under acomplex transaction that also left the Hong Kong investor LiKa Shing with a 43% stake. The purchase was one of thelargest direct investments in Canada by a Hong Kong investor.   The balance of Husky is owned by Toronto-based CanadianImperial Bank of Commerce, in which Mr. Li has a smallinterest, and Mr. Li's son, Victor, a Canadian citizen whospends much of his time overseeing a big family-owned realestate project in Vancouver, British Columbia.   Victor Li declined to comment on whether his family wouldgo along with a public offering of Husky shares, or whetherit is interested in selling all or part of its stake inHusky. He also declined to comment on reports that his fatheris shifting his focus to U.S. investments.   Mr. Blair didn't provide details of any possible offering,including its timing or size, and didn't say when Nova andits partners expect to make a final decision on whether toproceed.   Nova's announcement about Husky follows by less than amonth a decision by Nova to put its rubber division up forsale. The division has assets of C$1.4 billion, and generatedoperating earnings last year of C$61 million on revenue ofC$812 million. Nova said yesterday that purchase andjoint-venture agreements have been proposed so far for itsrubber business, though it didn't offer additional details.   Nova's willingness to consider taking Husky public didn'tcome as a surprise to analysts, who for months have predictedsuch a move. Richard Wyman, an analyst at Calgary-basedPeters andamp; Co., said Husky's share price might not command themultiple accorded other integrated oil and gas producers,however, in view of the company's C$1.2 billion in debt. &quot;Itwould take four or five years' cash flow to retire that debt,which, in relative terms, would make Husky a relativelyleveraged company,&quot; he said.   Though the Canadian government recently announced plans toproceed later this year with an initial public offering ofPetro-Canada Inc., the country's biggest domestically ownedoil and gas producer, Mr. Wyman said he believes there wouldalso be strong investor interest in Husky.</TEXT></DOC>
