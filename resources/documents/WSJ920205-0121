MCI's results also were helped by the full-year inclusionof revenue from the old Telecom USA Inc., which MCI acquiredin the last half of 1990 for $1.2 billion.</LP><TEXT>   Fourth-quarter net was $144 million, or 52 cents a share,compared with $127 million, or 47 cents a share, in theyear-earlier period. Revenue rose to $2.16 billion from $2billion. The number of common shares outstanding increased to262 million from 255 million. Operating income grew 8.7% to$276 million from $254 million.   For the year, MCI reported profit of $551 million, or$2.01 a share. While that is 84% increase from 1990's $299million, or $1.06 a share, MCI's 1990 results had beenreduced by a $550 million third-quarter charge againstearnings to account for a network modernization program.Revenue in 1991 grew 9.8% to $8.43 billion from $7.68billion. Operating income was $1.09 billion compared with$620 million, reflecting the third-quarter charge.   MCI's interest expenses declined by $20 million to $47million in the quarter, and while depreciation expensesclimbed by almost $120 million, that was one-fourth of thethird-quarter increase.   Analysts said MCI held its own in a tough economy andactually showed volume growth for the year that was almosttwice the industry rate. MCI said traffic volume grew 11.6%last year, compared with about 6% for the industry and 2.6%for the third-quarter, an indication of a gain in marketshare because American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s volumegrew 2%.   However, revenue growth from the third to fourth quarterswas flat and &quot;there was no improvement in operating marginsof 12.8% between the third and fourth quarter,&quot; indicatingincreased sales expenses, said Jack B. Grubman,telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber Inc. Moreover,noted Robert B. Morris III, analyst at Goldman Sachs andamp; Co.,&quot;their new Friends and Family marketing program is a bigprice cut,&quot; which will affect revenue and margins goingforward into 1992.   &quot;There was a seasonal problem in the fourth quarter where(Christmas and New Year's) holidays fell in the middle of theweek in December, cutting business traffic,&quot; said O. GeneGabbard, MCI's chief financial officer. &quot;We grew 1 1/2 to twotimes the market and in this tough economy that's awfullygood.&quot;   Mr. Morris agreed that an improvement in the economy in1992 would &quot;atone for a multitude of sins in the industrysuch as price cutting and increased marketing and salesexpenses,&quot; but for now MCI can expect increased marketingexpenses in 1992 to push new service programs.   But Mr. Gabbard doesn't expect the margin pressure toabate. &quot;I wouldn't expect a radical change (at MCI), juststeady kind of growth pattern. Frankly we don't expect achange in the economy through the first half of the year.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
