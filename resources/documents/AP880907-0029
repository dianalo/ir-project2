The violence, combined with the resignation Tuesday of nearly200 Foreign Ministry officials from the ruling party, was anotherblow to the besieged government of President Maung Maung.   Sources described the situation as chaotic. Many residentsclosed the doors of their homes and shops, and traffic was minimal.   Looters broke into the Customs Department warehouse, a buildingof the Education Department and soap and textile factories. Thieveswere spotted carrying away air conditioners and office equipmentfrom the Rangoon office of the U.N. Food and AgricultureOrganization.   A livestock and poultry farm near the city's airport waspilfered.   More troops were seen in the Kamayut Hledan area near the campusof Rangoon University, where students have held rallies andmeetings to plot strategy to force the government to give in totheir demands for democracy.   The radio broadcast was the first stern warning aboutintervention to stop looting, which has been occurring in thecity's suburbs for several weeks and spread downtown Tuesday, whenthe government allowed looting to go unchecked.   A statement from the 187 Foreign Ministry employees who resignedfrom the Burma Socialist Program Party said they decided Monday toquit en masse to protest 26 years of one-party rule.   Many other government departments have expressed opposition tothe government through public statements, strikes anddemonstrations. The unrest has crippled the administration, whichfaces mass demonstrations nationwide Thursday if it does not yieldto demands for democracy.   But the government has refused to budge from its plan for theparty leadership to meet Monday to consider organizing a referendumon establishing multiparty democracy.   ``We have now reached a stage where the government should complyforthwith with the people's wishes. Any responsible governmentwould have done so long ago,'' said the statement from the ForeignMinistry employees.   ``Procrastination in any form by the government, either byresorting to irrelevant legal procedures or by various maneuvers,tactics, (and) ruses designed to retain the reins of power wouldinevitably bring about immense suffering to the people, togetherwith the ultimate threat of fratricidal strife,'' it said.   A ministry officer said the party resignations would have littleeffect on work of the ministry, which has been minimal since theupheavals began in late July.   Ministry sources said employees of 16 of the 26 foreigndiplomatic missions, except for the ambassadors, expressed supportfor the demands of their colleagues in the Foreign Ministry.   Sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said hundreds ofpeople Tuesday carried away bags of rice from a warehouse in thewestern part of the city, then sold it to merchants for a quarterof the normal price.   Nearby, looters took frozen fish and equipment from a warehouseat the Fisheries Department, and another group stole provisionsfrom a Food and Beverages Corporation warehouse near the RangoonUniversity campus, the sources said.   Two rice-filled carriages at the Central Railway Station werepilfered by railway employees where were later joined by nearbyresidents.   Residents of the suburb of South Okkalapa earlier reported thatat least 20 people died Monday in a clash between looters andmembers of a neighborhood ``vigilance committee'' who rushed to agovernment biscuit factory to stop looting.   On Monday, opposition leaders Aung San Suu Kyi and formerDefense Minister Tin Oo threw their support behind a demand by onestudent group that an interim government be formed by 8 p.m.Wednesday or protests will follow Thursday.   Virtually every day, at least one of the more than 40 studentgroups has held news conferences or meetings to demand democracy.   The demands also are being circulated in the more than 20 dailynewsheets, which pro-government groups also have used to try tosplinter the opposition and criticize a multi-party system.   Burma's turmoil mounted after students rioted in September 1987to protest economic policies, then led broader-based streetprotests in March and June.   Street riots flared anew after Ne Win resigned July 23 after 26years in power and the party chose hard-liner Sein Lwin to succeedhim.   Government radio said 112 people died in Rangoon in riotingagainst Sein Lwin, who resigned after only 17 days. Diplomatsbelieve many more people were killed.   Demonstrations have been largely peaceful since Maung Maung tookpower Aug. 19 as the first civilian leader in 26 years.</TEXT></DOC>
