JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States is joining its Europeanallies in pushing for elimination of all ozone-depleting chemicalsby the end of the century, a sharp acceleration of the schedule forending their use.   President Bush said Friday he has asked the head of theEnvironmental Protection Agency to join the call to banchlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, by the year 2000 at an internationalconference that begins this weekend in London.   ``Recent studies indicate the 50 percent reduction (of CFCs asprovided by a 1987 treaty) may not be enough,'' Bush said.   The United States accounts for about one-third of the productionof ozone-damaging chemicals, primarily CFCs, which are widely usedas coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners and as a cleaningagent for electronic and computer equipment.   Scientists have raised concerns about the chemical because itfloats into the stratosphere before it breaks down, interacting withthe gaseous veil of ozone that shields against the sun'scancer-causing ultraviolet rays.   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly flew to London on Friday totake part in the conference to discuss ways to slow down ozonedestruction. Representatives from more than 100 nations also willtake part in the meetings being hosted by British Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher.   In remarks to a group of high school science contest winners atthe National Academy of Sciences, the president said the UnitedStates will support the call ``for the elimination of CFCs by theyear 2000 provided safe substitutes are available.''   Reilly, according to administration sources, had stronglyrecommended at a White House meeting Thursday that the United Statesjoin its European allies and call for the complete elimination ofCFCs, as opposed to cutting production by 50 percent as required bycurrent treaty.   Many scientists have said that a 50 percent cutback would not beenough to protect against serious ozone depletion.   On Thursday, the 12 nations of the European Economic Communityannounced that they have agreed to a ban on the chemical in theircountries by the end of the century.   Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., another members of the U.S. delegation tothe London conference, said Friday that even quicker action isneeded because ``every year of delay implies an additional five to10 years that these chemicals will remain in the atmosphere.''   Gore has called for elimination of all CFCs by 1994.   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., ranking minority member of theEnvironment and Public Works Committee, called the president's move``very encouraging'' but also urged that CFCs be eliminated wellbefore the year 2000.   The 1987 treaty has been ratified by nearly 40 nations, includingthe United States, Japan, most of Western Europe and Soviet Union.But it includes a provision that allows additional measures,including a complete ban, if further ozone damage is found.   The parties to the treaty are scheduled to consider anaccelerated phase-out schedule at a meeting in Helsinki, Finland, inearly May. The London meeting, which begins Sunday, is described asa dress rehearsal for the Helsinki session.   According to the World Resources Institute, the United Statesproduces roughly one-third of the world's CFCs, with E.I. DuPont deNemours andamp; Co. the world's largest producer. There were 750 millionpounds of CFCs produced in the United States last year and about thesame amount in Western Europe, according to Dupont.   Dupont, which accounts for about half of the U.S. production, hasannounced plans to stop making the chemical, perhaps as early as themid-1990s and will begin to offer substitutes next year.</TEXT></DOC>
