Keating Jr. to admit to federalauthorities that he committed thrift-related crime.   Bruce F. Dickson, 38 years old, was accused of bank fraudin a one-count federal information issued by the U.S.attorney's office here. An information, a formal chargeagainst a person who has waived the right to have the caseagainst him presented to a grand jury, usually signals that aguilty plea is forthcoming.</LP><TEXT>   Prosecutors alleged that Mr. Dickson was involved indirecting Lincoln's funds, by means of loans and investments,to third parties who in turn used the money to make &quot;strawpurchases&quot; of land and securities from the thrift'ssubsidiaries. Under the scheme described by the government,Mr. Dickson allegedly also created documents that falselysuggested the loans and investments were arms-lengthtransactions.   Mr. Dickson is expected to be arraigned today in federalcourt here. His attorney, Michael Lightfoot, didn't returnphone calls seeking a comment.   A guilty plea by the former thrift executive -- who alsoserved as senior vice president of Lincoln's parent, AmericanContinental Corp. of Phoenix, Ariz. -- would likely bolsterthe federal government's anticipated case against Mr.Keating, American Continental's former chairman. As reported,a federal indictment against the 68-year-old businessman andother former associates is expected this week. Mr. Keatingwas convicted on Wednesday of state securities-fraud charges.   In March, another former Lincoln president, Raymond C.Fidel, pleaded guilty to securities fraud arising from thesale of American Continental bonds at the thrift's branchesin California, and in July, Robin S. Symes, former Lincolnchairman and chief executive officer, pleaded guilty tosimilar charges.   Another former Keating associate, onetime AmericanContinental attorney Mark S. Sauter, admitted in March thathe conspired to deceive federal regulators who were reviewingLincoln's loan files. And in October 1990, Arizona realestate developer Ernest C. Garcia pleaded guilty to bankfraud in connection with a scheme to provide Mr. Garcia loansin exchange for his role in arranging the purchase of realestate from a Lincoln unit.   All four men, along with Mr. Dickson, are said to becooperating with federal prosecutors.</TEXT></DOC>
