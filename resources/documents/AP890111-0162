Leaders of the Iran-based Afghan resistance accused the SovietUnion, which backs the Marxist Afghan government in Kabul, of beinginflexible after talks held in Pakistan ran aground.   The troops gave up over the weekend in Afghanistan's easternNangarhar province, Fazle Akbar, director of the pro-guerrillaAfghan Information and Documentation Center, said Wednesday.   Akbar also said the Kama and Gushta district headquarters in theprovince fell this week to the U.S.-backed Moslem insurgents, calledmujahedeen, or holy warriors. Six guerrillas were killed in thebattle for Gushta, 24 miles west of the Pakistan border, said Akbar,who reported no other casualties.   Soviet and Afghan jet fighters have been bombing the Kamadistrict headquarters, about 36 miles west of the Pakistan bordersince it fell Tuesday, guerrilla sources said. Akbar said guerrillasshot down a Soviet-made MiG 27 bomber near Kama with a U.S.-madeStinger anti-aircraft missile.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman saidthe Soviets were continuing the withdrawal they promised to completenext month as part of a U.N.-mediated agreement reached last year.   ``We continue to see evidence that the Soviets are in the processof preparing to withdraw,'' Redman said. ``These signs include theoverland movement north of Soviet troops from the Kabul garrison inrecent days, and the closure of the Soviet military hospital inKabul.''   His statement apparently was based on Western intelligencereports, and the U.S. official declined to provide further details.   Pakistan, which hosts more than 3 million Afghan war refugees,has been a staunch supporter of the rebels, who have been fightingthe government in Kabul for the past 10 years.   The Soviet Union sent more than 100,000 soldiers into Afghanistanin 1979 to help the government battle the rebels. In April, Moscowpromised to withdraw its forces by Feb. 15. Half had left by August.   The Kremlin's special envoy to Afghanistan Yuli Vorontsov said inIslamabad and again in Moscow on Tuesday that the withdrawal of theremaining 50,000 soldiers could be delayed.   Vorontsov said guerrilla attacks on withdrawing Soviet troopswould force the soldiers to stay and fight, not withdraw. Headdressed a news conference Saturday at the end of a four-day visitto Islamabad, where he met with Afghan guerrillas based in Pakistanand Iran.   The Sunni Moslem guerrilla leadership headquartered in Pakistanpromised Vorontsov the rebels would not attack withdrawing Soviettroops.   Vorontsov's efforts to build an agreement on a broad-basedgovernment to move into Kabul after Feb. 15 ground to a halt Mondaywhen guerrillas refused to accept a coalition with the rulingcommunists.   Guerrilla leaders said the Marxist People's Democratic Party ofAfghanistan has been the cause of the 10 years of war, along withthe presence of Soviet soldiers and could not be accepted now in apostwar government.   Leaders of the Shiite Moslem Afghan resistance based in Iranaccused the Soviet Union of being inflexible after the talks inPakistan.   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus,quoted Mohammad Karim Khalili, spokesman for the mujahedeen, at aWednesday news conference when he returned.   ``In these talks the Soviets had nothing to say, and deadlockedthe talks due to their insistence that the present Kabul governmentmust play a role in the future Afghan government,'' Khalili wasquoted as saying.   Khalili said no date was set for a future meeting.   In other developments, guerrillas said they closed the roadbetween Pakistan and the provincial capital of Jalalabad. Akbar saidefforts to reopen the road, which is the major trade route betweenPakistan and Afghanistan, has caused heavy casualties on both sides.   The road closing is also being blamed for food shortages in theAfghan capital of Kabul, where Western diplomats said people arelining up for as long as three hours for bread.</TEXT></DOC>
