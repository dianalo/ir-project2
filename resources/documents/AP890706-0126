U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell sentenced North onWednesday to a three-year suspended sentence, two years' probation,$150,000 in fines and 1,200 hours of community service work.   In a related case today, U.S. District Judge Stanley Harrissentenced public relations consultant Richard Miller to serve twoyears' probation and perform 120 hours of community service forusing a tax-exempt foundation to funnel private donations to North'said pipeline for the Nicaraguan rebels.   Carl ``Spitz'' Channell, who with Miller helped raise more than$10 million for the Contras, is to be sentenced on Friday. Both menhad pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the government.   Fifty-eight members of the House composed a letter to Bush urginga pardon for North, arguing, ``It is time to put an end to thepolitical persecution of an honorable man who has served his countrywith distinction.''   Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif., who led the effort, still plans toforward the letter to Bush even though it was written before thesentencing and anticipated that North would draw a prison term,spokesman Paul Morrell said today.   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush had nocomment on the sentencing and had not considered a pardon.   ``We haven't discussed a pardon,'' Fitzwater said. ``There's beenno discussion. It hasn't ever been discussed.''   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he believed Bush should pardonNorth because the fine was too high and the loss of the formerMarine Corps lieutenant colonel's pension was too stiff a penalty.   The Navy announced that as a result of the sentencing it wassuspending North's $23,000-a-year pension earned in 20 years ofservice. But it recommended the pension be restored by ComptrollerGeneral Charles Bowsher, who has the final say.   North said after the sentencing that he planned to press anappeal of his conviction and looked forward to carrying out Gesell'sorder that he devote 1,200 hours to a new program to help Districtof Columbia youths avoid drug involvement.   ``I welcome the chance to work for these folks and anybody in thefight against drugs,'' North said.   Gesell said he believes North still lacks understanding of ``howthe public service has been tarnished'' by his activities, adding,``Jail would only harden your misconceptions.''   The judge told North: ``Your notoriety has caused manydifficulties but it also has made you a rich man. ... You cancontinue to flame the myth by which you have supported yourselfduring these recent difficult years or you can turn around now anddo something useful.''   North is free to continue the $25,000-a-speech tours that haveoccupied his time since his conviction for aiding and abetting inobstruction of Congress, for destroying or altering governmentdocuments and for accepting a gratuity _ a security fence around hishome.   The shredding conviction bars North from holding federal office.   North had asked the judge for lenience.   ``I have devoted nearly two decades to the service of our countryand I would never knowingly do anything to hurt it or any of itsinstitutions,'' he said in a soft voice. `` ... I grieve over whathas happened and I truly pray about it every day.''   North was convicted on May 4 for his role in the Iran-Contraaffair, in which the government secretly sold weapons to Iran andfunneled some of the proceeds to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.During the trial, North argued he was merely following the orders ofsuperiors in the Reagan administration.   Lawmakers on Capitol Hill generally applauded Gesell's sentencingdecision.   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., the chairman of the House Iran-ContraCommittee, called the sentence ``good and wise'' and said: ``JudgeGesell balanced difficult facts, recognizing Colonel North'sdistinguished military record and his devotion to family with thefact the jury convicted him on three counts and his difficultposition with regard to his superiors.''   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senate Iran-ContraCommittee, said, ``I am certain that Judge Gesell's sentence isappropriate, in light of the unique circumstances of this case.''   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., said: ``I don't think that anybody,or very few people, wanted all of the additional chaos in thecountry, the additional hard feelings that we have too much of rightnow, of having Oliver North trundled off to jail waving the Americanflag.''   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., a North supporter, said on ABC-TV's``Good Morning America'' that the sentence ``was a little milderthan I had come to expect. We had been told Gesell was a hangingjudge and I think he really tempered justice with mercy in asentence which, all things considered, was pretty fair.''   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, interviewed with Hyde, sounded anote of dissent. He called the sentence ``a disappointing surprise''and said ``it makes it much more difficult for the specialprosecutor to go after other (Iran-Contra) cases and get aconviction.''</TEXT></DOC>
