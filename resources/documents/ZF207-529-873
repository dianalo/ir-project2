whileBell Atlantic and Pacific Telesis Group, however, in the mid-Atlantic andChicago regions respectively saw revenues rise from telephone services, bothbenefitting from strong local economies.andM;-  o  -andM;No complete figures, but troubled Kaypro Corp says that its fiscalandM;second quarter sales were just $6.3m against $19.5m for the previous year,although it did make a tiny operating profit against a $1.9m loss a year ago;sales for the six months plunged to $15.6m from $42m a year ago - blamed bythe company on &quot;negative press combined with pressure from a principal lenderwhich caused dealers and end users to develop concerns with regard toKaypro's future - &quot;we have recently paid off this creditor which has put usin a position to reassert ourselves in the PC marketplace,&quot; Kaypro says.andM;-  o  -andM;Foxboro Co of the eponymous Massachusetts town has teamed up withandM;Chino Corp of Tokyo to create the equally-owned Chino-Foxboro Corp to marketFoxboro's Intelligent Automation Series systems in Japan.andM;-  o  -andM;16 women were arrested after a recent police raid on Tandy's TCandM;Electronics Korea Corp research institute in Seoul, putting an end to aneight-day siege: the women had taken hostage Koo, the president of thecompany, who closed down the TC factory back in March, and disappeared,leaving workers without wages or severance pay; Mr Lee managed to escapethree days before the raid, while the women, who were hoping to force Tandyofficials in the US to discuss re-opening the plant, were asleep; the messagefrom Tandy's HQ in Fort Worth Texas, is that the decision to close thefactory, which has been occupied by most of TC's 1,400 workers since March,is &quot;final&quot;.andM;-  o  -andM;The Independent Cellular Retailers Federation, whose founderandM;members claim over 50% of the independent cellular distribution market, hasissued its first Charter and Code of Practice: the Charter includes clausesrelating to servicing, charging and installation;
