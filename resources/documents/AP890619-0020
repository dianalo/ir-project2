This 20-year-old was not a main organizer of the student-leddemocracy protests that ended in the bloody onslaught by Chinesesoldiers this month.   She is not in hiding, and she is not trying to perpetuate themovement for democratic reforms, a free press and an end tocorruption.   But she had been deeply involved in the movement that began inmid-April, reading speeches on her school's loudspeaker system,spending considerable time with student protesters in TiananmenSquare and handing out leaflets.   She also took part in the hunger strike that focused worldattention last month on the few thousand young people occupyingTiananmen, when supporters swelled the number to 1 million.   For these reasons she asked that neither she nor her school benamed, though she agreed to speak privately with a reporter in asecluded location. She said she wanted to talk about what she sawand experienced _ events the government has spent the last weekvigorously denying.   ``I saw where two people had been run over by a tank. The bodieswere gone, but some of their insides were still there,'' recalledthe student from a prominent Beijing university.   She was filmed at the scene by soldiers with video cameras nearTiananmen the night of June 3 when the army moved in behindautomatic weapons fire, tanks and armored vehicles.   ``I saw many, many people wounded and taken away on flatbedtricycles,'' she said. ``When they shot at us, we just dove for theground. I'd only seen that in movies before.''   She is worried also because she has been interviewed on Americanand European television networks. After the crackdown, Chinesetelevision showed footage shot by a U.S. television network of a mansaying thousands were killed at Tiananmen.   The television commentator called him a ``rumor-monger,'' andwithin hours he had been captured and was shown humbly recanting hisaccount. The government has said 300 people were killed in theassault, mainly soldiers.   Independent estimates have put the death toll at up to 3,000,most of them unarmed civilians.   The student noted that many compare the current crisis to thedreaded 1966-76 decade of communist revolutionary turmoil whenworkers, soldiers and students took the law into their own hands andcentral authority collapsed.   ``In the Cultural Revolution, Mao Tse-tung pitted the peopleagainst themselves,'' she said. ``Deng Xiaoping (the current seniorleader) cannot do that today: the people are united againstdictatorship and corruption.''   Her father, an intellectual, recently talked with her about theterrors of the Cultural Revolution. ``He didn't want to tell me forseveral years because he wanted me to stay pure,'' she said. ``Butnow he has to tell me because he thinks it is very dangerous for mewith my character because I show my anger and show what I think.''   Her father told her how many of his friends were arrested becauseof just one or two sentences in their diaries or letters that wereperceived as `counterrevolutionary.'   ``My father told me not to write a diary,'' she said. ``If thepolice find it, I'll be arrested.''   Her diary bears no entries this month for June 3-6. ``I was tooshocked to write anything. Now I write that I'm suspicious of theparty and socialism. I used to think socialism was the only correctway because we were taught so. We were taught that the party belongsto the people. But now I'm suspicious of socialism. I'm anti-party.''   Despite her outspokenness, she says she is not trying to escape.   ``You can't hide. If you go to the provinces and if they want tofind you they will. My father wanted me to go to my aunt's home in anortheastern province, but I wouldn't go. My father has calmed down.He just wants me to shut my mouth and stop writing.''   She acknowledges the pro-democracy movement is snuffed out andmay not return for years.   ``A friend thinks it will be one or two years after Deng's death,but I think things will stay the same after that,'' she said.``There are other old people in the Central Committee.''   She referred to the influential octogenarian revolutionaries inthe Communist Party leadership, whom Deng is believed to have linedup behind his hard-line policy against dissent.   ``The Chinese government is too powerful,'' the student said.``They use the army and guns.''   Last week she and other students put on white shirts with blackarmbands to mourn their fallen classmates.   ``But a student told us it was very dangerous to wear that, thatsome people had been arrested for it. He said, `Let's keep oursorrow in our hearts,''' she said.   ``It's very tiring to be Chinese, to try and protect yourself, tohide your feelings, hide your thoughts,'' she sighed. ``I can't bearthe atmosphere. You must be careful about everything. It'sfrightening.''</TEXT></DOC>
