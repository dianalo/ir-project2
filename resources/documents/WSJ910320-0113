Money managers Bruce I. Jacobs and Kenneth N.Levy don't make a move on a stock without running it throughmore than 50 tests.   Crunching numbers with a computer they took two years toprogram, Messrs. Jacobs and Levy repeatedly scour 3,000stocks looking for clues to each issue's future direction.They use those findings to rank the stocks from best toworst, then implement what is known on Wall Street as a&quot;long-short&quot; strategy: They buy the 150 names at the top ofthe list -- though avoiding concentration in any one industry-- and sell short the bottom 150; selling short entailsborrowing shares and selling them in anticipation of buyingthem back later at lower prices.</LP><TEXT>   So far, the Jacobs Levy computer has done well ferretingout the best and worst stocks, though its record has yet tostand the test of time. Since launching their long-shortstrategy in May, their company, Jacobs Levy EquityManagement, has chalked up a 30% gain on its assets undermanagement. That's nearly twice the increase in Standard andamp;Poor's 500-stock index over the same period, although Messrs.Jacobs and Levy detest being compared to the Sandamp;P or any otherstock-market index.   They prefer being compared to the Treasury bill rate,which has returned about 6% since last May, and indeed that'show they're paid. Jacobs Levy receives an annual fee to 1% ofassets under management plus 20% of any gain on assets abovethe Treasury bill rate.   The long-short approach Jacobs Levy takes -- a so-calledmarket neutral strategy intended to allow investors to profitregardless of the direction of the overall stock market -- isgrowing increasingly popular with big investors. Usually,institutions won't trust their money to managers without afive-year track record, but Messrs. Levy and Jacobs alreadyhave attracted some major-league clients. The firm'sbelievers include Virginia's public-employee pension fund andthe retirement fund for computer maker Unisys Corp. Withseveral new accounts coming on board, Jacobs Levy hasrecently doubled its assets under management to $260 million.   &quot;They're unique in the way they value securities,&quot; saysBudge Collins, a Newport Beach, Calif., pension consultant,who recently added Jacobs Levy to a group of managers herecommends to clients. &quot;Nobody uses as many valuationtechniques as they do.&quot;   That accounts for much of their early success, say Messrs.Levy and Jacobs, who together ran a $1 billion portfolio atPrudential Insurance Co. of America before venturing out ontheir own in 1986. While managers typically favor oneinvesting style -- value, growth, small-company or the like-- to pick stocks, Jacobs Levy uses all of these methods andmore in choosing issues to buy or short.   &quot;There is a tendency to get whipsawed by only looking atone factor,&quot; says Mr. Jacobs. He and Mr. Levy believe thestock market isn't completely efficient, leaving pockets ofmispricing, or &quot;anomalies.&quot; The trick, they say, is to weighmany anomalies at once, untangle the effect of one factorfrom another and to figure out which ones are working thebest at the moment.   For example, using just the popular definition of valuestocks as those with low price-earnings ratios can put alarge number of utility stocks in the group, they say. Thatmakes a low P-E portfolio vulnerable to an oil price increaseor a nuclear accident, factors that otherwise would be nearlyirrelevant to value stocks. To get around this problem,Jacobs Levy uses numerous definitions of value, includingdividend yield and values of breaking up or taking over acompany.   Further, &quot;We find that different notions of value workdifferently at different times,&quot; says Mr. Jacobs. Onewell-known anomaly is that stocks often decline aftercompanies report disappointing earnings. In anticipation ofthis anomaly taking hold among bank stocks last fall, whenthe economic outlook was highly uncertain, Jacobs Levy sold alot of bank stocks short. In all, their bank shorts accountedfor an unusually large 11% of the firm's portfolio.   But as interest rates started coming down later in thefall, the still-poor bank earnings reports were relativelyless bearish for bank stocks, some of which even startedrallying. Jacobs Levy say their computer picked up thechange, causing them to shift in early December to a neutralposition in which their long holdings equalled their shortholdings.   How do they know which anomalies to believe and when? Withsix advanced degrees between them, Messrs. Jacobs and Levyused their academic backgrounds in finance and computers tosort out dozens of anomalies supposedly affectingstock-market prices. Some factors work frequently, theyfound, such as the tendency of fast-rising stocks toovershoot and then correct in price. Others, such as the&quot;January effect&quot; of small-stock prices rising early in theyear, really have more to do with tax considerations than howbig the stock is, according to the Jacobs Levy research.   &quot;They were the first to bring so much of this anomalymaterial together,&quot; says Charles A. D'Ambrosio, editor of theFinancial Analysts Journal, which has published severalarticles by Messrs. Jacobs and Levy. &quot;What they discovered isthat there is a lot of noise in the system.&quot;   High-powered computers are the only way to cut through thenoise, making the Levy-Jacobs computer difficult for smallinvestors to copy. The two managers note that in addition totracking thousands of stocks, they also hold a large numberof positions because they expect to make only small profit oneach investment. &quot;We're not way out on any one limb,&quot; saysMr. Levy.   Messrs. Levy and Jacobs went into business initially asmanagers who bought stocks and only sold ones they held. Butas their ranking system also listed stocks they thoughtlikely to fall in value, Unisys, with a $50 million account,and other clients asked them to add a short side to theirportfolios. The firm still runs long-only portfolios.   Messrs. Levy and Jacobs say anomalies come and go in themarket, so they have designed their system to adjust to suchchanges. &quot;The problem with exploiting any one inefficiency isthat everyone knows that it's out there, and as more and morepeople get into it, it gets arbitraged away,&quot; says Mr. Levy.&quot;A black box that works today isn't going to work forever.&quot;   ---                   Long and Short of It                                                                                                          Top long and short positions among 300 holdings of JacobsLevy Equity Management Inc.
