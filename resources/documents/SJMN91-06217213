In &quot;The Rituals of Dinner,&quot; classics scholarVisser briskly and non-judgmentally produces example after example of culinarycustoms from long ago and far away that make one -- may I speak frankly here?-- green around the gills.;    &quot;The Rituals of Dinner&quot; is a sequel of sorts toVisser's highly regarded &quot;Much Depends on Dinner,&quot; a historical andanthropological examination of a simple meal. That book, published in 1986,was straightforward in concept: Visser took the components of an imaginarymenu -- chicken, rice and so on -- and wrote what amounted to a long NewYorker article about each.;    &quot;Rituals&quot; takes on a larger subject: not a fewspecific foods but the rules that govern the human custom of bringing foodback from wherever we got it and distributing it among family and friends.That behavior -- food sharing -- is thought by some anthropologists to be thecornerstone of all human culture; humans being what they are, it's hedgedabout with more taboos and mandates than you can shake a chopstick at. ThoughVisser's writing is elegant and her research is thorough and impressive, shehas bitten off more than any writer, or reader, can chew.;     Nevertheless,she gets off to a sensational (and I use the word advisedly) start. &quot;Peoplehave indeed been boiled in pots,&quot; she writes cheerfully in her openingdiscussion of p's and q's for the anthropophagite. Furthermore, they've been&quot;roasted by spit, rack, or exposure to an open fire. They have also beensteam-baked, cooked on preheated rocks and in earth ovens, smoked. . . .&quot; Shefollows this with several pages on Aztec ritual that read like &quot;Silence of theLambs&quot; with footnotes, and had the effect of reminding me how glad I am not tohave been born either Aztec or conquistador.;     The customs she describeswith such relish aren't restricted to cannibals, either. Until the early 19thcentury, for example, well-bred Britishers kept chamber pots in the diningroom so gentlemen could answer calls of nature without interrupting the flow,so to speak, of conversation. Although this surely wasn't Visser's intention,it all begins to make anchovy pizza, beer and ESPN sound like culturalartifacts from the Golden Age of etiquette.;     As for the slurping andspitting that went on during the actual Golden Age, don't even ask.;    Theproblem with &quot;Rituals&quot; is that this kind of descriptive anthropology, althoughgreat fun in the short term, loses its oomph when it's used to excess. That'swhat happens when Visser settles down to a lengthy rumination on dinnerparties, broadly defined: why we have them, whom we invite, where we seat ourguests and why, and so forth. In a relentless tide of historical anecdote, thehistory of hand washing is followed by an analysis of tablecloth folding;after that come a few paragraphs on why cutlery is arranged the way it is,then we're on to centerpieces. It's too much of a good thing, like a glass ofhollandaise sauce.;    Not that Visser doesn't make some interesting points.For example, the argument underlying this huge superstructure of descriptionis that eating together is so quintessentially human an act that feastingcontains every fundamental theme of a culture: power structure, genderrelationships, even cosmogony. At the very least, this should give yousomething to think about the next time you attend some boring banquetsurrounded by those tacky people your spouse works with. (You might also keepin mind Visser's subsidiary thesis: Rules of etiquette evolved to keep ourinnate aggressiveness in check while all those irritating people,inhibition-loosening drinks and temptingly sharp objects are in the sameroom.);    &quot;The Rituals of Dinner&quot; is loaded with information, and thebibliography alone (in three languages, no less) would provide the energeticreader with material for several years of mental snacking, but it isdefinitely heavy fare. Readers who soldier through its sometimes fascinating,sometimes enervating 400-plus pages will amass enough arcane facts to dine outon for a lifetime.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JOANN C.
