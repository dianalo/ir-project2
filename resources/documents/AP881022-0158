However, a huge ridge formed by colliding ice masses stood inthe way of a breakthrough for the California gray whales, membersof an endangered species. The big marine mammals were about fourmiles from open water.   A second ice-smashing Skycrane cargo helicopter was standing bytwo hours away in Prudhoe Bay in case rescuers decided a secondconcrete ice-bashing ``bullet'' was needed.   And at White House direction, the Air Force assigned the largestaircraft in its inventory _ the C-5A Galaxy _ to ferry moreequipment from Prudhoe Bay to Barrow, Air Force Maj. Doug McCoysaid Saturday.   The whale nicknamed Bone disappeared beneath the foot-thick iceFriday afternoon. By midnight Friday, rescuers on the ice near thissmall Eskimo town on the Arctic Ocean had given up hope Bone mightrejoin the others.   North Slope Borough biologist Geoff Carroll said the whale waspresumed dead.   ``Everyone is sorry to hear about the whale, but I don't thinkit was totally unexpected,'' Carroll said Saturday. He had toldreporters earlier the whale was the weakest of the three, and hadsome respiratory problems.   Bone, Crossbeak and Bonnet became trapped at a small breathinghole in unseasonably heavy ice more than two weeks ago during theirannual migration south. Open water was too far away for them toreach it without surfacing to breathe.   The missing whale got its name because skin on its snout hadbeen rubbed to the bone by the rough ice surrounding the breathinghole. That condition may have led to Bone's death, said biologistCraig George.   ``Once they get a bone infection, they go pretty quick,'' Georgesaid.   The whale's body probably sank to the bottom but may float in afew days because of gases from decomposition, George said. ``We'lleither find it or a (polar) bear will,'' he said. Polar bears feedon whale carcasses.   Something will have to be done about the ice ridge, and soon, ifthe remaining whales are to be freed, said Col. Tom Carroll, incharge of the Alaska National Guard's two Skycrane helicopters onloan for the rescue.   ``We looked for an alternate route (bypassing the ridge) anddidn't find it,'' he said. ``If there's no way through it, it willhave to be tackled early while the whales still are some ways fromit.''   The ridge lies about a quarter-mile from an area of open waterleading to the open sea.   The ridge was believed to be too thick to be punctured by thehelicopters' five-ton, steel-reinforced concrete hammers, and localice specialists were assessing the situation Saturday, said GeoffCarroll. ``I think we're going to blast,'' he said.   Bone disappeared about the same time rescuers had their greatestsuccess.   About two dozen Eskimo volunteers, many of them bowhead whalehunters, led the whales almost a half-mile closer to open waterFriday by using chain saws to carve a string of 10-by-30-footbreathing holes. They continued carving holes on Saturday.   De-icers, which keep the holes open by agitating the water,freed the Eskimos to work on new holes.   ``After waiting so long for high tech equipment, it's the localpeople who have kind of taken over and made some progress,''Carroll said.   The whales, meanwhile, were swimming from hole to hole,apparently responding to efforts to lead them to open water,biologists said.   ``Their swimming patterns now are about what you'd expect themto be,'' said Withrow, who is from Seattle.   Biologists removed a de-icing machine from the whales' originalhole late Friday and started one of the machines in the mostdistant new hole. They also shined a bright light in the farthesthole.   In a matter of minutes, the whales popped up in that hole,touching off a chorus of cheers from people on the ice.   Rescuers shoveled snow and ice into the original hole Fridayevening in an effort to seal it and discourage the whales fromreturning. But late Friday, they did just that, nosing up throughthe slush.   ``That's OK,'' Morris said. ``It's just a little retrogression.We're in good shape.''   The first huge CH-54 Skycrane helicopter loaned by the Guardworked in the opposite direction from the Eskimo crews, workingfrom the open water back toward the whales, so as not to frightenthe mammals.   The aircraft, designed to haul heavy cargo, used a concreteblock suspended from its cargo hook to punch four 15- to 20-footholes in the ice at 75-yard intervals.   ``They hover the helicopter 20 feet over the ice, and drop the`bullet,''' said Spec. 4 Wade Palmer, a Guard spokesman. ``It dropsthrough the ice on the second or third try. Then they pull it backout.''   The second Skycrane abandoned the repeatedly frustrated effortto drag a 185-ton, icebreaking ``hover-barge'' 230 miles from theoil fields at Prudhoe Bay.   The population of endangered California gray whales has risen toabout 20,000, growing at an annual average of 2.5 percent for thepast decade, officials said.   The whales spend their winters in the warm water off Mexico'sBaja California and Southern California and summer in the food-richnorthern seas.</TEXT></DOC>
