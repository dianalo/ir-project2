The president is likely to get bad news today when a key Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, is expected to announce his opposition to Judge Bork, according to Senate aides.    The pronouncement would follow a series of announcements from other senators saying they would vote against the president's nominee. Those included Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), whose statement Friday was an especially shocking and damaging blow. Both Sens. DeConcini and Bentsen are conservatives whose support the administration had hoped to win over.    Nonetheless, the president pressed his case for Mr. Bork Saturday during his regular radio address. And on NBC-TV's &quot;Meet the Press&quot; yesterday, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) said Mr. Reagan had authorized him to say, &quot;We have to follow through, win or lose.&quot;    The president is expected to lose his first showdown over the nomination tomorrow, when the Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on the 60-year-old Mr. Bork. Senate leaders have promised that the nomination will be sent to the Senate floor for further consideration. But with the likely decision of Sen. DeConcini, it is almost certain that the nomination won't move forward with a positive recommendation, which is in itself a setback for the president.    Indeed, depending on the vote of Sen. Howell Heflin (D., Ala.), there's a chance of a negative recommendation. The senator, also on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; yesterday, said he would &quot;probably&quot; take a position for or against Judge Bork at the committee meeting. Senate aides suggested he is leaning toward voting against Mr. Bork.    Sen. Heflin, a former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, is a leading indicator of the inclination of other Southern Democrats. Some of those Democrats have already declared their opposition to the nominee, and at least some of the votes remaining are indispensible to the administration. If Sen. Heflin votes against Mr. Bork in committee tomorrow, the nomination probably would be sent to the Senate floor with a negative recommendation, which would all but doom the Reagan effort.    No one knows for sure which way Sen. Heflin will go, but yesterday he hinted that he is leaning against Mr. Bork. In answer to a question, he listed the names of three federal judges, two of them Southerners, he thought would be good nominees in Mr. Bork's stead. He also said his decision on Mr. Bork would be based on &quot;whether he's a conservative or an extremist,&quot; and then cited one of Mr. Bork's harshest and most sarcastic speeches on jurisprudence, which he delivered April 3 of this year in Philadelphia.    In that speech, Mr. Bork lambasted those who don't follow the &quot;original intent&quot; of the framers of the Constitution in making judicial decisions and spoke of a &quot;wave&quot; of new proponents of original intent who &quot;will sweep the elegant, erudite, pretentious and toxic detritus of non-originalism out to sea.&quot; During his testimony before the Senate committee, when asked by Sen. Heflin what he meant, he said he was referring to law professors, not judges.    Many senators say Mr. Bork is likely to lose no matter what Sen. Heflin decides, and even those delivering good news for the nomination have been less than enthusiastic. Sen. David Boren (D., Okla.), the one surprise supporter to declare on Friday, quietly tossed a brief statement into the press gallery in midafternoon, and quickly boarded a plane out of town.    But President Reagan is crawling further out on a political limb in support of Mr. Bork -- and aides say he gives no indication that he has thoughts of turning back. The aides say that the judge himself wants to see the nomination get to the full Senate for a vote, even if he loses in committee. They say Judge Bork is &quot;depressed&quot; about the way things have been going, but that he wants to see it through.    White House aides said the president has grown angry and determined to fight further for the Bork nomination, and isn't inclined to listen to advice from political allies suggesting he should cut his losses quickly if momentum in the Senate continues to build in opposition to Judge Bork. &quot;The president is mad, and he's dug in his heels,&quot; says one of his senior advisers. The adviser says there's been no organized discussion of an alternatative candidate.    The White House strategy is to arrange direct presidential conversations with each of the 17 senators still listed as undecided by the president's aides. Mr. Reagan had meetings Friday with four, including unpublicized visits with Republican Sens. John Heinz of Pennsylvania and Robert Stafford of Vermont. His talks failed to bring pledges of support from any. Still, more visits are likely today and Tuesday, and a television advertising blitz is planned.    A central White House goal is to keep any more Republicans from defecting. Aides say they were far more concerned about the loss last week of a single Republican, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, than the defection of Southern Democrats. Antagonism toward Sen. Specter is running high in the White House, and aides aren't hesitant to say so or to suggest they will look for ways to vent their anger. By trumpeting their anger at Sen. Specter, White House officials appear to hope to frighten other Republicans who may be thinking of following suit.    ---   Gerald F. Seib contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
