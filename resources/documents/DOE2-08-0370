Superconducting oxides with a thickness of 5000 A wereformed at 800 {sup 0}C, with an onset of 92 K and a zero resistance at70 K. The films contain mainly the YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O{sub 7} phase,with the 103 and 020 diffraction peaks being the major ones observed.The high deposition temperature used is shown to help the formation ofthe YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O{sub 7} phase, leading to the observed superconductivityusing SiO{sub 2} substrates.</TEXT></DOC>
