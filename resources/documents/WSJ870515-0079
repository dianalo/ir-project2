Such suitors failed to surface, and the company said it didn't know why its stock was climbing in heavy trading. Allegis's stock yesterday rose $1.875 to close at $71.50 as more than 3.5 million shares changed hands. It was the second-most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange.    Boeing, which reached a sale and financing arrangement with Allegis and its United Airlines unit Tuesday, in part to thwart a takeover or dismantling of the company, issued a statement apparently intended to reinforce its support of Allegis management.    Boeing said, &quot;We intend to protect our investment by relying on the terms of the financing agreement that guard against actions or events which could adversely impact the financial strength of Allegis.&quot;    The United Airlines pilots union, which made a takeover offer for the company early last month, said the Boeing pact wouldn't keep it from pursuing a buyout of the airline. </TEXT></DOC>
