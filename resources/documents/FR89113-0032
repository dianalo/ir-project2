Introduction </ITAG>A notice of proposed rulemaking for coal product valuation regulationswas published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on January 15, 1987 (52 FR 1840), with a 90-daycomment period. The public comment period was reopened on July 9, 1987.Additional comments were accepted through July 23, 1987 (52 FR 25887).A total of 136 comments were received from industry representatives, electedmembers of Congress, State governments, local governments, Indian Tribes,Indian organizations, and other persons. During the initial comment period, a public hearing on the proposed rulemakingwas held on March 3, 1987, in Denver, Colorado. The Royalty ManagementAdvisory Committee (RMAC) also held a meeting on April 1, 1987, in Denver,Colorado, on the proposed coal valuation rulemaking. Industry, State, andIndian representatives also met with MMS and Department of the Interior(Department) officials during the comment period to discuss issues pertainingto the proposed rulemaking. Minutes from these meetings were included inthe record and were incorporated as comments on the proposed rulemakingalong with the transcripts from the public hearing and RMAC meeting, andwritten comments received by MMS. On August 12, 1987, MMS published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 29868) reopening the public comment periodfor 69 days primarily to obtain public comments on a proposal submittedjointly on behalf of the coal and electric utility industries. This proposalincluded a comprehensive, section-by-section set of revisions to the January1987 proposed rulemaking. The MMS received 48 comments on the industryproposal which are discussed in more detail below. The MMS also recently completed two rulemakings to adopt new product valuationregulations for oil (53 FR 1184, January 15, 1988) and gas (53 FR 1230,January 15, 1988). The rulemaking process for oil and gas included draftrules, proposed rules, and two further notices of proposed rulemaking withdraft final rules appended. (Citations are included in the preamble tothe final rules.) On June 7, 8, and 9, 1988, MMS held open meetings with representativesof the Western States, Indian Tribes, and the coal and electric utilityindustries to discuss a draft of this proposed rule. Several suggestedchanges and additions offered at those meetings were incorporated in aFurther Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for coal product valuation regulationspublished in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on July 15, 1988 (53 FR 26942) with a 60-daycomment period. A total of 51 commenters comprised of representatives ofState and local governments, other Federal agencies, the coal and electricutility industries, Indian Tribes, Indian Tribal organizations, individuals,and other organizations responded. A public hearing on the proposed rulemaking was held during the 60-daycomment period following the July 15, 1988, notice. Minutes of that September7, 1988, meeting are included as comments on the proposed rulemaking.Except for the addition of the severance tax exclusion from coal valueat andSection; 206.257(b)(5), the regulatory provisions in this notice havenot changed significantly from the July 15, 1988 proposal. Therefore, weare not repeating the preamble discussion in this notice. Interested partiesshould refer to the July 15, 1988, notice (53 FR 26942).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Purpose and Background</ITAG>These rules supersede all currently effective coal royalty valuation directives,such as those contained in numerous Secretarial, MMS, and U.S. GeologicalSurvey Conservation Division (now Bureau of Land Management Onshore Operations)decisions and orders. These rules apply to production on or after the effectivedate of the final rule for all leases.Structurally, these rules add sections to 30 CFR Parts 202, 203, and 206,revise andSection;andSection; 206.10 and 210.10, revise subpart titles in Part212, and remove paragraphs from 30 CFR 203.250 and 43 CFR 3485.2. Paragraph(b) of andSection; 203.250 is redesignated to Part 202 at andSection; 202.250.For the convenience of coal lessees, payors, and the public, the followingchart summarizes the regulation changes: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,p6,6/7,i1,s10,r10</C>  <H1>Regulation changes (all from 30 CFR, except as noted) </H1><H1>Descriptions </H1><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>I.

Two exceptionsto this generalization are notable. Under these rules, lessees may deductfrom gross proceeds their costs of Federal Black Lung excise taxes, abandonedmine lands fees, and severance taxes. However, these deductions are onlyavailable to Federal lessees, and are not available to lessees of Indiantribal or allotted lands. Secondly, Indian cents-per-ton royalty provisionsare included in these rules. Royalty provisions also appear in Title 25of the Code of Federal Regulations at 25 CFR 211.15(c), 212.18(c), 213.23(c),and 214.10(b).These rules expressly recognize, however, that where the provisions ofany Indian lease, or any statute or treaty affecting Indian leases, areinconsistent with the regulations, then the lease, statute, or treaty shallgovern to the extent of the inconsistency. This same principle appliesto Federal leases.The Mineral Leasing Act (MLA), as amended specifically by the Federal CoalLeasing Amendments Act of 1976 (FCLAA) requires that: <ITAG tagnum="21">A lease shall require payment of a royalty in such amount as the Secretaryshall determine of not less than 12\1/2\ per centum of the value of coalas defined by regulation, except the Secretary may determine a lesser amountin the case of coal recovered by underground mining operations. </ITAG>The MLA and leases issued under the MLA do not specifically define ``value,''``gross value,'' ``gross proceeds,'' or ``value of production,'' or howto arrive at those values.Valuation has long been described as the process of determining the worthof, or setting a price upon, anything. In the U.S. economic system, valuehas often been closely associated with market value. This means that thevalue of any good or service in terms of economics is defined by its abilityto command other goods or services in exchange. The most common mediumof exchange is money. Therefore, many economists signify the value of agood or service by the amount of money which it will command, in otherwords its value in terms of the commonly accepted medium of exchange. The concept of establishing values based on the transactions of the marketplaceand the benefits of market competition are well known. The Supreme Courtsummarized the positive effects of competition when it said: ``Basic tofaith that a free economy best promotes the public weal is that goods muststand the cold test of competition; that the public, acting through themarket's impersonal judgment, shall allocate the nations's resources andthus direct the course its economic development will take.'' <T3>Times-Picayune Co. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>345 U.S. 594 (1953).  The regulatory approach to royalty valuation of the these final rules recognizesthe existence of a market economy and subscribes to the premise that theprivate sector is presumed to be the most appropriate economic agent vis-a-visGovernment planning and direction. Hence, in deference to the market concept,MMS accepts the principle that the most effective and efficient value-settingmechanism is the value set by competition in the free market.  Value in these regulations generally is determined by prices set by individualsof opposing economic interests transacting business between themselves.Prices received for the sale of products from Federal and Indian leasespursuant to arm's-length contracts are often accepted as value for royaltypurposes. However, even for some arm's-length contracts, contract pricesmay not be used for value purposes if the lease terms provide for othermeasures of value (such as Indian leases) or when there is a reason tosuspect the bona fide nature of a particular transaction. Even the alternativevaluation methods, however, are determiend by reference to prices receivedby individuals buying or selling like-quality products in the same generalarea and having opposing economic interests. Also, in no instance can thebasis of value be less than the amount received by a lessee in a particulartransaction.<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Response to General Comments Received on Proposed Coal ProductValuation Regulations and Related Topics  </ITAG>The notice of proposed coal valuation regulations was published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 15, 1987 (52 FR 1840). The publiccomment period was reopened from July 9, 1987, through July 23, 1987. OnAugust 12, 1987 (52 FR 29868), MMS reopened the public comment period for60 additional days to receive public response on a comprehensive alternativevaluation proposal, which was submitted jointly by representatives of thecoal and electric utility industries. On November 17, 1987 (52 FR 43919),MMS gave notice that it intended to issue a further notice of proposedrulemaking. In that notice, MMS explained that it had received many commentsthroughout the comment periods. The MMS also stated that some commentshad been received after the close of the 60-day period following the August12, 1987, notice. The MMS concluded by stating that all comments receivedsince the January 15, 1987, proposed rulemaking and until the deadlineof the planned further notice of proposed rulemaking would be accepted.On July 15, 1988, MMS published the further notice of proposed rulemaking(53 FR 26942). All comments postmarked by September 13, 1988, which wasthe closing date of the comment period, were accepted and included in therulemaking record.  The MMS received many diverse comments on the principles underlying theproposed valuation methodology. Some comments were directed to proposingalternative valuation methodologies. These comments did not address specificsections of the proposed regulations. The general comments were categorizedinto 7 issues plus a section on other miscellaneous comments, which areaddressed first. Following that discussion, MMS will discuss comments receivedpursuant to specific sections.General Issue 1: The Ad Valorem Royalty Rate   <T3>Comment: </T3>One issue that permeated many of the comments, but whichis unrelated to coal valuation, concerns the royalty rate. Several commentersfrom industry and States concluded that the 12\1/2\ percent royalty ratewas too high thus placing an unfair financial burden on lessees, whichin turn places them at an economic disadvantage. One State commented thatroyalty rates, in concert with valuation of deep-mined coal, place undergroundmines at a disadvantage, and the 8-percent royalty rate ``should be loweredaccordingly to a maximum rate of 5 percent, but more equitably, a lowerrate should be adopted by legislative action.''  <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The royalty rate is not a valuation issue. The 12\1/2\-percent royalty rate imposed on surface coal operations is required bystatute. The Mineral Leasing Act (MLA), as amended by the Federal CoalLeasing Amendments Act of 1976 (FCLAA), requires the Secretary of the Interiorto determine a royalty ``of not less than 12\1/2\-per centum * * * exceptthe Secretary may determine a lesser amount in the case of coal recoveredby underground mining operations.'' The Bureau of Land Management (BLM)regulations at 43 CFR 3473.3-2 require a royalty rate of 8 percent forcoal from underground mines, with the provision to determine a lesser rateif conditions warrant, but in no case less than 5 percent. It is now wellsettled that BLM has the authority to readjust Federal coal leases andthat FCLAA and its implementing regulations apply to pre-FCLAA leases. <T3>Coastal States Energy Co.</T3> v. <T3>Hodel, </T3>816 F.2d 502 (10th Cir. 1987); <T3>FMC Wyoming Corp.</T3> v. <T3>Hodel, </T3>815 F.2d 496 <T3>(10th Cir. 1987); </T3>Ark Land Co., 97 IBLA 241, 244 (1987); <T3>Coastal States Energy Co., </T3>94 IBLA 352 (1986); <T3>Gulf Oil Corp., </T3>91 IBLA 93, 96 (1986); <T3>Ark Land Co., </T3>90 IBLA 43, 45 (1985). The MLA at 30 U.S.C. 209provides statutory authority to reduce royalty rates for those lesseesthat cannot successfully operate their leases under the prevailing termsand conditions. The MMS notes that BLM has been attentive to industry'sconcerns regarding royalty rates. The BLM issued a procedural documentconcerning guidelines for royalty rate reduction on June 26, 1987 (52 FR24347, June 30, 1987). By <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice dated August 5, 1988 (53 FR 29586), BLMgave notice of its intent to expand royalty rate reduction guidelines toaccommodate and facilitate expedited administrative handling of certainreduction applications. By <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice dated July 29, 1988 (53 FR 28822), BLMannounced a proposed rulemaking to amend royalty rates for undergroundmining operations.General Issue 2: Valuation of Coal Under Some Form of a Cents-per-MillionBritish Thermal Units (Btu) Valuation Procedure   <T3>Comment: </T3>During the initial comment period following the January15, 1987, proposed rules, MMS received several comments from industry thatadvocated a royalty valuation procedure based exclusively on the coal'sheat content. That value would be expressed in cents-per-million Btu. Additionalcomments were received after the July 15, 1988, notice, which further clarifiedhow the procedure was envisioned to function. Other comments were receivedexpressing either support or opposition to this alternative valuation procedure.Simply stated, the cents-per-million Btu valuation that industry proposedwould operate as follows: (1) An initial average value of all Federal surface-minedcoal would be established by dividing the monies received for Federal surface-minedcoal_less transportation and washing expenses, Federal fees and taxes,State and local taxes, and royalties_by the total number of million Btu'ssold. No price adjustment would be made for the sulfur, ash, or moisturecontent of the coal. (2) This average value would be tied to a currenteconomic index and would fluctuate annually with the rise and fall of thatindex. (3) Thereafter, a Federal lessee would pay a set royalty, adjustedto compensate for the index fluctuation, based only on the number of Btu'scontained in the coal sold or consumed. (4) Metallurgical coal, which isnot sold on a heat content basis, would be exempted from the cents-per-millionBtu method. (5) No recommendation has been made as to how coal sold undera non-arm's-length contract, or coal consumed by the Federal lessee, wouldbe valued to establish the initial cents-per-million Btu figure. Further,no recommendation has been made for valuing underground-mined coal.  One State commenter agreed with and three other industry commenters supportedthe cents-per-million Btu valuation procedure. These commenters generallyrationalized that the procedure was preferable to MMS's ``gross proceedsapproach'' because it is easy to administer and is more equitable becauseit separates value from the cost of mining.  <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS has thoroughly examined this proposed procedureand has concluded the proposal may not represent the market value. Thefollowing table illustrates the result of adopting a standardized coalvalue of $1.00 per million Btus, which would be applicable to all leases.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,b2,tp0,p6,6/7,i1,s10,7,8,7</C> <H1>Field/Area</H1><H1>Btu/lb</H1><H1>Standardized value/short ton at $1/MMBtu</H1><H1>Average market value/short ton (1985)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Fort Union (ND) <D>6,500 </D><D>$13.00 </D><D>$9.30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Powder River (WY) <D>8,400</D><D>16.80</D><D>8.67</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Uinta (CO, UT)<D>11,000 </D><D>22.00 </D><D>27.69</D></ITAG></ITAG>  As shown in this brief example, this procedure derives values that to notaccurately represent the coal market. From this example, it appears thatthe procedure is biased against low Btu coal.  Apart from the inherent flaws embedded in the pricing mechanism, it failsto recognize that coal has never been, or likely ever will be, valued solelyfor its heat content. Moisture, ash, and sulfur often represent criticalquality factors that must be taken into account by electric utilities priorto the purchase and consumption of coal. For example, the January 1987issue of <T3>Energy </T3>(Volume XI), published by Sun-Progress Inc., states, ``Scrubbersplaced in the stacks at generating plants are needed to remove the pollutantsfrom the emissions and, depending on the quality of sulphur and ash, canaccount for up to a third of a generating plant's expenses.''  The MMS also concluded that the development and selection of a single dollaramount per million Btu would not be easy and could gravitate into a highlycomplex, labor intensive exercise. For instance, detailed procedures wouldhave to be developed to explain how the base value is to be derived. Tobe equitably, other indexes would have to be developed to compensate forvariables such as moisture content, ash, sulfur, and so forth.General Issue 3: Grandfathering of Certain Agreements and ArrangementsUnder the Final Rules   <T3>Comment: </T3>Some industry comments received after the initial January15, 1987, proposed rulemaking stated that all existing coal sale contractsor supply agreements should be ``grandfathered'' under any new royaltyscheme. Under this approach, any such coal sales contracts would be subjectto the royalty requirements in effect at the time the coal supply contractwas executed. One of these comments cited the Interior Board of Land Appeals(IBLA) support for this position by quoting <T3>Kanawha andamp; Hocking Coal andamp; Coke Co., </T3>93 IBLA 179, at 183as follows: ``The method of calculating the value of coal for royalty purposesshall be that method set forth in the regulation on the effective dateof readjustment, and any subsequent regulatory change will not alter thatmethod.'' Similarly, two industry commenters requested that only leasesreadjusted after these rules become effective should be subject to theseregulatory requirements. Other respondents raised this issue again in commentssubmitted specific to andSection;206.250(b). In the preable to MMS's July 15, 1988, notice, MMS explained that it wasits intent that absent specific lease terms that set forth valuation criteria,the proposed rules, when final, would govern the valuation of coal fromFederal and Indian leases. However, MMS noted that there are some lesseeswith contracts that pre-date the Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act (FCLAA)of 1976 and that do not have reimbursement provisions common to contractsafter FLCAA's enactment. The MMS requested comments on whether there isa way to grandfather these contracts that would be consistent with therequirements of FCLAA and the MLA.  With regard to the comments that MMS should not make the new regulationsapplicable to existing pre-FCLAA contracts because the new rules wouldrequire royalty to be paid on payments which the commenters said are notroyalty bearing under existing rules, MMS requested further comments, specificallyidentifying the type of payments that are involved.  The MMS received comments that included examples of situations that thecommenters believed should not be subject to royalty under the final rules.These examples are:  <T3>1. Transfer of water rights. </T3>One comment stated that the minetransferred water rights as part of the consideration included in the negotiatedcoal sales contract. The commenter asserted that the water rights represented8.3 percent of the coal's sale price and should be royalty exempt.  <T3>2. Services provided by the purchaser that are typically the responsibilityof the lessee. </T3>Several lessees explained that because of the proximityof the mine to the power plant and because of long-standing operating relationshipsbetween the mine and power plant, the utility was crushing the coal onbehalf of the lessee. In other instances the commenter explained thereexists shared ownership of coal mine equipment such as draglines or coalmine facilities such as loadout facilities and primary crushers. The commentersinsisted that these services, which represent noncash elements of valueand would be subject to royalty under these final rules, should be royaltyexempt since these agreements precede the effective date of these rules. <T3>3. Lump sum prepayments. </T3>One commenter explained that a lump sumprepayment had been received to cover mine start-up capitalization costs.This commenter stated that since the payment was made prior to these rules,it should not be subject to royalty. This comment further explained thatthe lump sum payment ``had nothing whatsoever to do with royalty avoidance,''and that the payment does not affect the sales price.On a more general note, one State commenter offered the suggestion to payunder the final regulations only if those royalties would be less thanthat payable under the prior regulations. This commenter stated that thisprocedure should be used in those situations where the lessee's sales contracthas not pass-through provisions.<T3>MMS Response</T3>: The State commenter's proposal is administrativelyinfeasible and would constitute an extreme audit burden. Moreover, thelessee's royalty reporting burden would effectively be doubled, becauseeach reporting month the lessee would be required to perform an accountingunder two sets of regulations to determine its royalty payment.The MMS's position with regard to any form of consideration paid undera coal supply contract, for the sale of produced coal, is that such considerationis part of the value of coal and is therefore subject to royalty. In thisregard, the final rules represent a continuation of existing policy, exceptfor the exclusion from royalty value for costs of Federal Black Lung excisetaxes, abandoned mine lands fees, and severance taxes, as provided forat andSection; 206.257(b)(5). The MMS has an established record under priorroyalty valuation rules of aggressively pursuing royalty collections inthose situations where the lessee has been receiving noncash benefits fromits customer under coal sales agreements. Likewise, MMS has operated undera long-standing policy of accepting nothing less than the gross value receivedby the lessee for the sale of coal. With regard to the comment which referredto the lump-sum payment received to cover mine start-up capitalizationcosts, if the commenter's representation that the payment did not affectthe contract sales price for each ton of coal were in fact true, then thepayment may not be royalty bearing. However, it is MMS's experience thatin most situations these kinds of costs are recovered through the contractsales price and therefore are in fact consideration for coal production.In such a situation, MMS would require royalty to be paid on some or allthat lump sum. The reason for MMS's position is that a royalty is due onthe value of production in marketable condition. The lessee is obligatedto incur all costs to bring the coal production to that point, inlcudingall of the mine development costs, production costs, and costs of makingthe production marketable. If the buyer receives coal and in exchange transfersconsideration to the lessee to reimburse it for any of the above-describedcosts, then that payment is part of the value of the production. Hence,it is subject to royalty.A corollary issue is whether all or only a portion of such a one-time paymentis royalty bearing. First, no royalty would be payable unless and untilthere is coal production. Once there is production, the lump-sum paymentmust be equitably pro-rated. If the contract includes a repayment clauseor other applicable provision, that would be used. This would require anexamination of the contract terms on a case-by-case basis.However, if the contract does not contain a repayment clause or other applicableprovision, MMS will develop a schedule to amortize the payment over thefull tonnage deliverable over the life of the contract. If the contractterminates prematurely, royalty may not be due on the full lump-sum payment.By way of illustration, assume a $12 million lump-sum payment for start-upcapitalization costs. Assume further that the contract is for 12 yearsand the anticipated take, based on full utilization of the customer's installedcapacity, is 1 million tons/year. One possible equitable allocation methodcould be to allocate $1 of the lump-sum payment to each ton of production.If the contract were to terminate after 8 years, royalty may be due ononly two-thirds of the lump-sum payment.Therefore, MMS generally considers payments under a contract to be paymentfor coal production and royalty bearing. However, the lessee has the opportunityto rebut that presumption and demonstrate that the payment was not forcoal production. <T3>See</T3> discussion below regarding andSection; 206.257(b)(6).With regard to the language quoted above from the IBLA in <T3>Kanawha andamp; Hocking Coal andamp; Coke Co</T3>., the discussion waswith respect to a particular lease provision. Therefore, the IBLA's statementis not relevant to the vast majority of coal leases which do not have thesame provision.General Comment 4: Valuation of Coal Under the Joint Proposal by Coal andElectric Utility Industries<T3>Comment</T3>: The industry comments were submitted as a joint proposalby six groups representing the coal producers and electric utilities. Thisproposal included a comprehensive, section-by-section set of revisionsto the January proposed rulemaking, including a justification for the suggestedmodifications. The most significant revision in the joint industry proposalis to set aside the valuation standards contained in MMS's January 15,1987, proposed rulemaking and substitute, instead, the concepts of ``grossroyalty value'' and ``net royalty value.'' Industry stated the basis forthe their proposal is the Internal Revenue Code's (IRC) concept of ``grossincome from property'' as used for depletion allowance calculations (IRC613). This ``gross royalty value'' would be increased by amounts for non-Federalroyalties and reduced by processing allowances and amounts based on FederalBlack Lung excise taxes, Abandoned Mine Land fees, and State and localtaxes (such as severance taxes). The resulting figure would be the ``netroyalty value'' and upon which royalties would be paid. The ``gross royaltyvalue'' would exclude outbound (long-distance) transportation costs incurredwith f.o.b. destination sales. ``Gross royalty value'' would also excludetake-or-pay payments for royalty assessment.The Department received a considerable number of comments on the jointindustry proposal. A letter from the Governor of Montana, representingpersonal views and those of the Governors of Colorado, New Mexico, andWyoming, generally opposed the joint industry proposal and supported continuedreliance on the proposed valuation procedures. Several Governors subsequentlywrote individual letters to express personal opinions where their viewsdiffered from that of the consensus view. The Governor of Wyoming and theGovernor of Colorado indicated they could support exclusion of royaltyreimbursements from gross proceeds to address the ``royalty on royalty''issue. The Governor of Utah suggested that a depletable income method maybe incorporated into the hierarchy of MMS's gross proceeds valuation framework.However, he stated that the depletable income method ``should not reducethe fair market value or the royalty amount derived from the coal.''The Governor of North Dakota urged the Department to continue the ongoingreview of product valuation and expressed specific concerns regarding theproduction of lignite in the State.Numerous comments were submitted by electric utility firms and from Governorsof States that consume substantial quantities of western coal production.These commenters urged adoption of the joint industry proposal, statingthat the joint industry proposal would reduce fuel costs, which in turnwould reduce consumer electricity costs. Some commenters supported thevaluation proposal by rationalizing that a reduced valuation basis wouldcompensate for the increased ad valorem royalty rates now required underthe MLA.The Assistant Attorney General for Natural Resources, The Navajo Nation,offered comments to the Subcommittee on Mineral Resources Development andProduction during the Oversight Hearing on Proposed Coal Product ValuationRules on November 16, 1987. The Assistant Attorney General opposed thejoint industry proposal, stating: ``Industry's deletion of the conceptof `gross proceeds' for royalty payment purposes is inconsistent with theconcept underlying the present valuation regulations_that royalties fromad valorem leases be based on a percentage of gross proceeds. We urge MMSto retain the `gross proceeds' methodology for valuation.'' <T3>MMS Response</T3>: The Department expended considerable effort in reviewingthe joint industry proposal. Representatives from MMS and from the Departmentmet separately with representatives of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)to discuss the operation of the ``gross income from property'' rules andthe computation of the percentage depletion allowance. Also, analysts inthe MMS reviewed the potential advantages and disadvantages of revenueproblems that could arise if the joint industry proposal were adopted asthe basis of coal royalty valuation. The MMS analysts solicited input fromStates and coordinated with principal industry representatives to arriveat a mutually agreed upon range of royalty revenue amounts that would,in the collective judgment of the States, MMS, and industry, most likelyoccur if the joint industry proposal were accepted. Following this extensive review, MMS decided not to adopt the joint industryproposal. The following reasoning is provided to explain MMS's decision.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. The Joint Industry Proposal is not Readily Adaptable to Lease Accounting</ITAG>The MMS is required to collect and account for royalties on a lease basis.Royalty rates may vary from lease to lease; prices will vary from contractto contract; and contracts may dedicate specific reserves. The IRS determinationis made on a taxpayer basis, which would be an aggregate, at least, ofall leases and contracts for a single mine, and could conceivably encompassmore than one mining operation. Thus, the industry proposal seems to beinconsistent with the basis on which MMS must collect and account for royalties.Making the proposal consistent with MMS needs would require that MMS developan allocation procedure to convert depletable income to a lease basis.Such a procedure would likely be expensive and require the use of simplifyingassumptions to the extent of being unacceptable. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. The Joint Industry Proposal Creates New Auditing Problems </ITAG>The Joint Industry Proposal would be a new and complex approach to coalroyalty valuation determinations. It is significantly different from theexisting valuation methodology used for coal and other minerals. As a result,MMS (as well as State and Indian) auditors would be required to relearnan entirely new system. This necessarily would delay many audits. General Comment 5: The Advice of the Royalty Management Advisory CommitteeWas Ignored <T3>Comment</T3>: Some commenters stated that in the January 1987 proposedrulemaking, MMS neither acknowledged nor adopted the Royalty ManagementAdvisory Committee's (RMAC's) recommendations concerning coal product valuation.These commenters also stated that MMS did not provide its reasoning fornot accepting RMAC's recommendations. Several commenters reiterated thisposition following the July 15, 1987, notice. <T3>MMS Response</T3>: These comments are not supported by the record.The January 15, 1987, (52 FR 1840) <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice states that ``MMS also has consideredthe written and oral comments from the public on the draft rules and theresolution presented to the Secretary by RMAC.'' The MMS also noted withappreciation the dedicated efforts of all participants who worked on theproblems of coal valuation. The MMS considered the section-by-section analysisthat preceded the proposed rules adequate explanation and notice to thepublic, including RMAC, of the substantive reasoning and motivation thatguided the formulation of the proposed rules. General Comment 6: Royalty On Take-Or-Pay and Other Similar Type Payments<T3>Comment</T3>: The MMS received many comments concerning the inclusionof take-or-pay payments in the proposed gross proceeds definition. Fourcommenters, two Indian and two States, expressed support for the inclusionof take-or-pay payments as part of gross proceeds. One commenter reasonedthat the inclusion was proper ``since the other contractual terms may beaffected by  inclusion of such language in the selling agreement.'' Anothercommenter stated that gross proceeds ``does not simply mean the amountreceived by the lessee. Rather, it must have an expansive definition toinclude any consideration * * * including any minimum payments, stand-byfees, or take-or-pay payments.'' Other commenters recommended that thegross proceeds definition stand as proposed with respect to including take-or-paypayments, but offered no additional reasoning or support.Industry commenters generally opposed the collection of royalty on take-or-paypayments. Several commenters specifically stated that royalty is due onlyon production; others specifically stated that MMS lacks statutory supportto collect royalty on take-or-pay payments; and some commenters statedthat royalty should be collected on take-or-pay payments only under certaincircumstances. With respect to the issue that royalty is only due on production,one commenter explained that ``if no coal is produced, there is no diminutionin the value of the coal reserve and therefore no royalty should be payable.''Several other commenters took the same position. Another commenter statedthat the ``assessment of royalties on take-or-pay payments is inconsistentwith the traditional framework for royalty payments. * * * The royaltybecomes due only when coal is mined.'' Many commenters argued that thetake-or-pay payments serve as a mechanism to cover the producer's investmentrisk and as such do not constitute a prepayment for Federal coal. Severalcommenters continued by stating that the Government has no right to sharein the rewards resulting from risk of the capital investment. Several commentersdeclared that the proposed regulations were internally inconsistent, withcertain parts requiring royalties to be paid on take-or-pay payments notrelated to coal production, while other parts such as andSection;andSection;206.259, 206.255, and 206.257 [now designated andSection;andSection; 206.257,206.253, and 206.255, respectively] require royalty to be paid on coalproduced and sold or otherwise finally disposed of. One commenter alsosuggested that MMS adopt a wait-and-see position and let the courts decidethe legality of collecting royalty on take-or-pay issues. With regard to the comments citing MMS's lack of statutory support to collectroyalties on take-or-pay payments, one commenter noted that ``The plainlanguage of FCLAA (30 U.S.C. 207) ties royalty assessment to the valueof recovered coal.'' Other commenters echoed this view. Another commenterstated that the MLA does not allow royalty collection ``on coal not mined,produced and sold.'' Another commenter stated that ``The statutory authorityto include in production royalties payments made on `take-or-pay' provisionsas if they were `advance royalties' is certainly subject to question.''The commenter further noted that payment of advance royalties is controlledby 30 U.S.C. 207(b). The commenter concluded: ``Since advance royaltiescan only be accepted in lieu of continued operation_one percent of commercialquantities of recoverable coal reserves * * * if an operator is producingthe required one percent, section 6 [of FCLAA] would prohibit the lesseefrom reducing his production royalty payment by the amount of his `take-or-pay'payment, since these payments are not, by statute, considered `advanceroyalties.' '' As noted earlier, several commenters agreed that under certain conditionsroyalty should be collected on take-or-pay payments. One industry commenterstated: ``Some payments received under `take-or-pay' clauses may well constitutepayments for the disposition of coal produced by the lessee, and in suchcases we agree that they should be subject to royalty.'' Other industry commenters objected to collecting royalty on any other contractuallyrequired compensatory payments, other than take-or-pay, which are not basedon coal production. The commenters referred to such payments as assignmentpayments, prepaid reserve payments, damages awarded by courts, buy-outs,bonuses, and capacity charges. In the July 15, 1988, notice (53 FR 26951), MMS requested further commentsas to whether the following payments identified by industry should be subjectto royalty:1. Damages recovered under a court judgment for the purchaser's breachof the sales contract;2. Payments made under a force majeure clause;3. ``Settlement'' payments made to terminate a sales contract before thecontractually-specified termination date; this includes situations wherethere may or may not be a follow-on contract;4. Payments for assignment of an interest in the lease;5. Payments not designated as part of the purchase price but made on aperiodic or regularly scheduled basis under the contract;6. Payments not designated as part of the purchase price, which may ormay not vary with the amount of coal delivered, and paid on a one-timeor not regularly scheduled basis under the contract in a specific sum orcalculated under a prescribed formula;7. Payments or reimbursements for services or processing costs customarilythe responsibility of the lessee, including that required to put the productin marketable condition.Many industry and several State comments agreed that absent any physicalremoval of the resource from the leased property, no royalty should bedue on any type of payment received by the lessee. Five comments advocatedthe assessment of royalty on take-or-pay or similar type payments. Somecommenters suggested that take-or-pay type payments should be royalty bearingbut that royalty collection should be deferred until the time of production.One State commenter also suggested that interest should accrue on take-or-paypayments beginning at the time those payments are received by the lesseeand until royalty is paid. One State commenter maintained that take-or-payand similar type payments should remain in gross proceeds but its specificapplication causing an assessment of royalty would be contingent upon afinding that such payments are consideration for the sale of coal.While industry commenters contended that most take-or-pay payments areto reimburse the lessee for the risk involved in the lessee's investmentof capital into his mining operation, a Tribal representative stated thatthe lessor is also at risk. The lessor has committed his reserves to themining operation and thus has a sizable risk and commitment to the operation.Therefore, for sharing in the risk inherent in the mining operation, thelessor should also share in all proceeds received by the lessee, includingall take-or-pay payments.Many comments cited the August 17, 1988, Fifth Circuit Court of Appealsdecision in <T3>Diamond Shamrock Exploration Co. et al v. Hodel,</T3> 853 F.2d 115915th Cir. 1988), where the Court ruled in the context of natural gas royaltiesthat royalty payments are not due on receipt of take-or-pay payments, butare only due when the purchaser takes so-called ``make-up'' gas (gas takenin excess of minimum quantities in later periods against the purchase priceof which previous take-or-pay payments are credited).<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The Department has not further appealed the FifthCircuit's decision in <T3>Diamond Shamrock,</T3> and will apply the rationale of that decisionfor purposes of coal royalty valuation. Therefore, MMS's final coal regulationshave been revised from previous proposed rules by revising the definitionof ``gross proceeds'' in 30 CFR 206.251 to exclude the phrase ``* * * paymentsor credits for advanced prepaid reserve payments subject to recoupmentthrough reduced prices in later sales; payments or credits for advancedexploration or development costs that are subject to recoupment throughreduced prices in later sales; take-or-pay payments; and reimbursements,including but not limited to * * *.'' Of course, as discussed further below,if any of such payments at some point is used as a payment for producedcoal, then they would still be subject to royalty as gross proceeds forproduced coal.For consistency within the body of the rules, 30 CFR 206.257(g) has beenamended in part by deletion of the sentence, ``If take-or-pay paymentsare a part of gross proceeds, no additional royalty shall be due if futuremake-up deliveries are taken, unless the purchaser is required to pay anyadditional amount because only a partial payment was previously made oras a result of price increases during the make-up period.''The MMS will not extend the Fifth Circuit's ruling beyond its holding toexclude from value and gross proceeds any payment received by the lesseenot specfically denominated as purchase price, a position which the FifthCircuit decision neither implies nor supports. Instead, the regulationsat 30 CFR 206.257(b)(6) will provide lessees the opportunity to rebut thepresumption that payments received by the lessee are not part of the totalconsideration paid for coal and, hence, are not royalty bearing. Sincethe question at issue is not whether a payment was made but, instead, whetherthat payment is part of the consideration paid for coal, MMS would expectany rebuttal to address the commercial relationship between the buyer andthe seller (lessee). Specifically, MMS would require substantial explanationof why the value paid by a purchaser, under a coal sales contract, is notequitable to the value received by the lessee for the sale of coal.In all instances, the substance of the transaction or contract clause,and not its form, will control.General Comment 7: Marketable Condition RequirementFollowing the January 15, 1987, proposed rulemaking, MMS received numerouscomments regarding the definition of marketable condition. Some commentersstated that the definition was so vague and subjective as to be meaningless.Some commenters advanced alternative approaches to the term marketablecondition. Many industry commenters concurred with the alternative valuationproposal submitted jointly by the coal and electric utility industries.Under that proposal, royalty would be computed at the earlier point ofeither when coal has been extracted, crushed, and sized or when the coalis loaded for delivery. In actual application, royalty would typicallybe assessed after coal had been processed through the crushing and sizingcircuit, since the alternative to sell run-of-mine uncrushed coal doesnot constitute common industry practice.Several commenters expressed concern that MMS's valuation approach wouldassess royalty on beneficiated products such as coal that has been subjectedto ``deep thermal drying,'' or ``coal pelletization.''In order to address these concerns, MMS added andSection; 206.265 to theJuly 15, 1988, notice and specifically requested in the preamble that commentersrespond as to whether the definition of marketable condition requires furtherdevelopment. Commenters were asked to propose specific changes to the proposedregulatory language.No commenter responded directly to MMS's request for specific alternativelanguage designed to clarify the definition of marketable condition. Severalcommenters stated that freeze-proofing and dust suppression were not elementsof marketable condition but instead provided a service for the purchaser.One commenter stated that the sale of run-of-mine coal constituted coalin marketable condition because the purchaser accepts the coal in thatcondition. In this situation, it is the buyer (utility) that owns and operatesthe crushing facilities.One Indian commenter stated that it is the buyer's specifications thatestablish marketable condition and, therefore, the value of all beneficiationshould be included in the royalty value.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The requirement that the lessee place the leaseproduct in marketable condition at no expense to the lessor is a vitalroyalty concept. It defines the minimum level of effort and expenditurethe lessee must undertake to place leasehold production in merchantablecondition without any contribution or sharing of expenses by the lessor.Any further processing activity beyond that necessary for placing the leaseproduct in marketable condition would be a derivative of the lessee's contractualsales obligation. From a royalty perspective, the additional processingwould ostensibly qualify for a deduction from royalties accruing from thesale of leasehold production that has undergone processing beyond thatnecessary to prepare the mineral as a marketable product.Marketable condition is the form and condition of leasehold productionresulting from the application of normal mining processes. The establishedmarket demands and expects that lease production be in such a conditionthat it can be accommodated by existing buyer facilities used for receipt,handling, and consumption of leasehold production. With respect to coal,processes commonly applied by mine operators (or lessees) to prepare coalfor the market include all operations which extract, sever, or otherwiseseparate coal from its in-place position in the geologic strata; crushing(to limit upward size), sizing, storing, blending, and loading for shipment(including oiling); and all transportation requirements in and about themine beginning at the point of extraction and including movement to allplants and facilities in which normal mining processes are applied.Processes which are not identified with common mine operations or practicesinclude both surface and in-situ coal gasification or liquefaction operations,any other operations involving the chemical alteration of coal, and operationsinvolving the physical processing of coal to a condition of quality beyondthat normally attributed or associated with coal marketed from the samearea.However, the conditioning of coal for the market does not consist of auniform set of processes. Rather, the marketable condition requirementis as flexible as the requirements of different market segments. For example,some types of coal sold to certain market segments are not normally screened.Instead, the run-of-mine coal is passed through a crusher to reduce thelarge pieces. The result of this size reduction is prepared coal that canbe accommodated by both seller (lessee) and buyer's coal handling facilities.In other situations where coal fines present problems, the marketable conditionrequirement for coal will include screening, to eliminate the specifiedcoal fines fraction.Therefore, the test of marketable condition relies on: (1) The market segmentthat coal is sold into; (2) the customary requirements of preparation orconditioning normally expected by that market segment; and (3) the typicallevel of preparation or conditioning by coal producers in that area.Therefore, under no circumstances will MMS accept the gross proceeds establishedunder any sale of coal that does not meet the market's minimum requirementfor marketable condition. Specifically, the sale of run-of-mine coal forsteam coal utilization by an electric utility does not constitute coalin marketable condition. In this situation, MMS will add to the gross proceedsthe cost of those normal mining processes which are ordinarily the responsibilityof the lessee. This provision is explicitly set forth at andSection; 206.257(h).Other Miscellaneous General Comments<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters expressed concern that deletion ofredundant royalty provisions from 43 CFR 3485.2 would create confusionbecause of cross-references found in other sections of 43 CFR Part 3480.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS agrees that some potential confusion couldresult if certain sections of 43 CFR Part 3480 continue to refer to portionsof 43 CFR 3485.2 which would be deleted under a final rulemaking. The BLMwill, as part of its normal ongoing housekeeping duties, ensure that 43CFR Part 3480 is appropriately modified to eliminate cross-references tononexistent sections.<T3>Comment: </T3>The MMS received ten comments from industry and one commentfrom a State requesting that the proposed rules be withdrawn and that newrules be written. Eight other industry commenters stated MMS's proposedrules were too complicated and urged MMS to adopt simple rules. As onecommenter explained, ``there's no reason for excessively complex administrativeprocedures to determine what should be paid.'' In that same vein, threeother industry commenters stated that the general intent of MMS's ruleswas not clear and that MMS should take additional measures to explain whatthe regulations would accomplish.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS believes there is great public interestto be served by issuing updated, consolidated, and clarified regulations.With reference to the comment that the rules propose excessively complexprocedures, MMS knows of no other procedure to communicate the necessarycost accounting and computation procedures imbedded in coal washing andtransportation allowances other than the furnishing of detailed instructionsand explanations. The MMS concludes that absent the detail furnished inthese proposed rules, lessees would be placed at increased risk of applyingimproper coal valuation methods and of deducting erroneous coal washingand transportation allowances.<T3>Comment: </T3>Twelve industry commenters, two State commenters, andone Indian commenter stated that the proposed rules constitute a majorrulemaking as described under Executive Order 12291. The contention isthat the proposed rules represent a significant change from the existingregulatory standard, thus, as one commenter described, mandating ``a fulland complete regulatory impact analysis.'' One comment from a State providedan opposite view stating, ``I do not see these proposed regulations forvaluation of coal as a profound change in the regulations already in effector in the practice which is being used by the MMS * * *.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The Department has determined that these rules donot constitute a major rulemaking under Executive Order 12291. This determinationobviates the need for a full and complete regulatory impact analysis.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters stated that MMS has not describedthe monetary impact associated with the proposed rules.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>During the period from August 1987 to January 1988,the Department conducted an extensive review of monetary impacts associatedwith this rulemaking. The Department did not work in isolation but ratherconsulted extensively with several western coal States and with severalindustry representatives.The Department recognizes that the exclusion of Federal and State productiontaxes will result in less royalty collections than if royalty were payableon the tax payments. It should be recognized, however, that future royaltycollections are expected to continue to increase in both nominal and realdollars. Moreover, several factors act to reduce the negative impact onroyalty, so that the ultimate reduction in the increase in future royaltycollections is less than might first appear. Finally, the offsetting benefitsattendant to excluding production taxes from the royalty base are sufficientlycompelling that the Department believes the public interest is ultimatelyserved by the exclusion.The production tax exclusion applies only to ad valorem coal production,and has no impact on the cents per ton royalties paid prior to lease readjustment.Federal coal royalty collections increased from $6.4 million in 1976 to$101.1 million in 1986, a 1,480 percent increase because of increases inprice and production (including the development of the Powder River Basin),and lease readjustments. Federal coal royalty collection increased by another40 percent between 1986 and 1987, with little change in production (lessthan 2.5 percent). This large revenue increase was due to readjusting leasesfrom the former cents per ton basis to the new ad valorem basis. Readjustmentscoupled with continued price decreases may increase 1987 revenues by morethan 50 percent, reaching 220 percent of the 1986 collections level in1990 when the readjustment process is expected to be largely complete.Rather than reducing royalties below current collection levels, the effectof the exclusion is to make the increase less dramatic_likely, 2,850 percentof the 1976 level rather than 3,350 percent, or 187 percent of the 1986level rather than 220 percent. The actual difference in Federal and State revenue collections, however,will be less than the potential difference in royalty collections. Royaltiespaid reduce taxable income for Federal and State income tax purposes. Tothe extent a coal lease is more profitable than it would otherwise be athigher royalties, a significant portion of that profit is absorbed by higherFederal and State income taxes. Moreover, it is expected that this increasedprofitability will also be reflected in higher bonus bids for coal leases.Finally, as discussed below, the exclusion is expected to make Federalcoal more competitive in the market, resulting in some increase in production.This increased production will act to broaden the Federal and State royaltyand tax base, resulting in higher revenue collections. To the extent increases in royalties are ``pass through'' items in existinglong-term coal supply contracts, the decreased collections will be reflected,on a dollar-for-dollar basis, in reduced electric utility generating costsand customer bills. To this extent, the ultimate beneficiary of the taxexclusion will be the consumer. The Department believes that any remaining impact on royalty collectionsis more than offset by other local, regional, and national benefits. Tothe extent demand responds to price, the exclusion is expected to resultin some increase in Federal coal production, as well as a reduction inthe royalty related development delay. Similarly, the exclusion also resultsin a tendency to expand the geographic market for Federal coal, which mayfurther increase production. Some of this increased Federal coal productionmay well come at the expense of increased oil consumption, thus fosteringobjectives of energy supply diversification and reduced dependence on foreignoil, with the attendant balance of payments benefits. Additional local and regional employment and income benefits would be realizedto the extent that lower royalty payments contribute to making unprofitableoperations marginally profitable. This would result in maintaining minesthat otherwise might shut down. Since coal mining is part of the regionaleconomic base in areas where it occurs, employment and income changes incoal mining affect jobs and incomes elsewhere throughout the region. Forexample, several studies have shown that for every 10 jobs in coal mining,between 6 and 10 additional jobs are created elsewhere in the region. Similarly,a recent study at the University of New Mexico shows that an increase inregional income of $2.46 would be expected for every dollar increase innet income from coal mining. The MMS also conducted a similar analysis for Indian lands. However, thisstudy is no longer relevant since under the final rules Indian leases willnot be subject to the AML fee, Black Lung excise tax, or severance taxexclusions. <T3>Comment:</T3> One Indian commenter asserted, ``The Assumption thatthe Lessee will Advance the Interest of the Royalty Owner is Not Groundedin Fact.'' The comment supported this position by stating that the underlyingassumptions such as an open marketplace for coal, the existence of arm's-lengthsales contracts, and that the lessee always acts to maximize its revenues,are ``simply not true.'' <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS disagrees with the assertions of this comment.There is an operative open marketplace for coal in the United States. Theexistence of arm's-length coal sales contracts between coal producers andelectric utilities, steel mills, export coal buyers, and other coal usersis a commonplace occurrence. Business literature is replete with explanationsof goals and objectives of American business. Typically a firm will endeavorto maximize the value of a business by obtaining as great a price for itsproduct as the marketplace will permit.<T3>Comment: </T3>Many industry commenters stated that MMS had writtenthe proposed coal product valuation regulations based on oil and gas industryprinciples. As stated in one comment, ``By attempting to overlay existingoil and gas valuation concepts on the federal coal royalty program, MMShas arbitrarily ignored the physical properties of coal, realities of coalproduction, and basic business principles.'' Many commenters followed theseobjections by asking that MMS withdraw the proposed regulations and rewriteregulations more specific to coal.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS considers the coal product value rulemakingas adhering to fundamental mining, preparation, and marketing preceptscommon to the entire extractive minerals industry.<T3>Comment: </T3>Numerous industry commenters claimed MMS's proposed regulationswere destroying the longstanding past practice of royalty valuation whichis supported by administrative and judicial decisions. Some commentersstated that MMS's regulations represented an attempt to broaden, not clarifyregulations pertaining to royalty valuation. One respondent offered, ``[T]heMinerals Management Service has demonstrated an attitude which borderson the rapacious. The proposed rules are nothing more than a naked attemptto maximize revenues from federal and Indian coal leaseholds.'' One commenterconcluded that MMS's use of longstanding policy to support these regulationswas untenable, because there is no longstanding policy for coal productvaluation.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The final rules are a rational policy choice withinthe bounds of the Secretary's discretion. Since Congress did not specifyhow the royalty value should be determined, the Secretary has discretionto adopt a reasonable set of standards for royalty valuation. ``[I]f thestatute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, thequestion * * * is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissibleconstruction of the statute.'' <T3>Chevron, U.S.A. </T3>v. <T3>Natural Resources Defense Council, </T3>467 U.S. 837, 843 (1964). Areviewing court will need not conclude that the agency's interpretationof the statute was the only permissible one, only that it was reasonable,and not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.In the case of <T3>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States </T3>v.<T3>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </T3>463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983),the court stated that ``[r]egulatory agencies do not establish rules ofconduct to last forever, and that an agency must be given ample latitudeto adapt their rules and policies to the demands of changing circumstances.''The agency is obliged to articulate a reasonable basis for its currentposition. The MMS has done so in this rulemaking.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two State and one Indian commenter stated that the mannerin which the proposed regulations are constructed essentially eliminatesthe protection of the existing regulations, and the self-implementing aspectsof the proposed regulations invite industry abuse. These commenters furthercharge that MMS was abrogating its monitoring, review and audit responsibilitieswith respect to coal product valuation. On the other hand, one industrycomment stated an objection to the ``subjective determination elements[which] indicate a significant distrust by the government of the coal industry'spast practices of valuation and accounting for royalty purposes.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS believes that no derogatory connotationof industry accounting or valuation practices should be attributed to theserules. These rules should also not be viewed as delegating valuation responsibilitiesand duties to industry. The report entitled ``Fiscal Accountability ofthe Nation's Energy Resources'' written by the Linowes Commission and publishedin January 1982 (p. xvi) stated that ``The Federal government should performan oversight role. It must not waste its limited resources on tasks thatare industry's responsibility. In managing royalty collection, it shouldnot remain mired in bookkeeping details that rightly belong to the lessee.Instead, it should develop systematic, independent cross checks of royaltiespaid and reports submitted by companies, and it should impose meaningfulpenalties for false statements or gross errors.'' The MMS considers theserules to carry out that recommendation.<T3>Comment: </T3>After industry commenters stated that MMS lacked statutoryauthority to maximize the rate of return for ``the public's resources''and that the regulations are ``greedy,'' two State commenters took theopposite position, ``demand[ing] that the Department establish royaltypolicies which do not undermine state and federal revenues, particularlyat a time when revenues are already curtailed.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS's acceptance of values established underarm's-length contracts cannot be characterized as ``greedy.'' The arm's-lengthvaluation standard is the most commonly utilized and the most accuraterepresentation of any good's true worth and does not constitute an unusualvaluation theory design to maximize the rate of return for the public'sand Indian's resources at the expense of the coal industry. The use ofarm's-length contract values maximizes the return to the public or theIndians to the extent that the lessee is also striving to sell coal atthe highest profit it can attain. In this respect, MMS is sharing in theproceeds of contracts that are the results of the free will of coal lesseesand their coal purchasers. Hence, the maximization of return to the lessoris normally an unintended yet unavoidable result.<T3>Comment: </T3>Many industry commenters stated that the proposed regulationsdo not promote development of Federal coal resources. An area of concernto these commenters is that these regulations discourage conservation ofFederal coal. Two industry commenters stated that the proposed regulationswould influence the economic behavior of the coal industry. One commenteroffered its rationale for this position by stating, ``The economic forcesof the marketplace would move mine plans away from high royalty/high costcoal to lower royalty/lower cost coal or would hasten the closure or cessationof the mining of such federal coal reserves.'' One commenter also stated,``that MMS or BLM, is party to the ups and downs of the coal business andas such should work with the industry to improve market share as well asprofitability.'' One comment stated that MMS failed to take into considerationthe Mining and Minerals Policy Act of 1970, which states in part, ``TheCongress declares that it is the continuing policy of the Federal Government* * * to foster and encourage private enterprise in (1) the developmentof economically sound and stable domestic mining * * *.'' One State commenterand one Indian commenter suggested MMS should ignore any potential economicimpacts that may result from the final coal valuation regulations. Opposingthis viewpoint, one industry commenter concluded that MMS should considerthe plight of the electric utility rate payer, who ultimately bears thefull burden of any royalty increase.<T3>MMS Response.</T3> The MMS disagrees with the statement that theseregulations do not promote development of coal resources. The MMS considersthese regulations to promote development to the extent that they wouldbetter communicate MMS's coal valuation policy to lessees. In this respect,the informed judgment of lessees, who are also prudent businessmen, isenhanced thus providing increased certainty regarding the economic consequencesof Federal or Indian coal lease production. The MMS has no mandate to promulgatecoal valuation rules which are expressly designed to preserve or improvethe Federal or Indian lessor's overall nationwide market share of coalproduction.  <T3>Comment.</T3> Two industry commenters concluded that MMS is attemptingto accomplish through administrative rulemaking what Congress should bedoing through legislation. One industry commenter further explained thatMMS's proposed valuation regulations ``fly in the face of the clear congressionalresolve and would properly be viewed as an `end run' around Congress.'' <T3>MMS Response.</T3> The MMS is not usurping the power of Congress. Tothe contrary, Congress' absence of specification on the issue of valuereveals Congress' clear invitation to the Department of the Interior tomeasure the application of value by the needs of later days. The MMS, likeall administrative agencies, is empowered to administer Federal statutesand prescribe necessary rules to place into effect the will of Congress.Title 30 U.S.C. 189 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to ``prescribenecessary and proper rules and regulations and to do any and all thingsnecessary to carry out and accomplish the purposes of this chapter * **.''  <T3>Comment.</T3> Two industry commenters stated that the proposed royaltyvaluation instructions are unclear when there is mixed mineral ownershipat a single mine. One commenter requested that MMS provide guidance forthe calculation of royalties ``when an operator is producing coal fromboth Federal and non-Federal [lands] * * *.'' This commenter also statedthat this issue becomes even more critical with respect to payments forinsurance compensation, coal recovered from waste piles or slurry ponds,take-or-pay payments, and purchaser reimbursements for certain cost items.Another industry commenter claimed that it is ``entirely possible thatthe definition of gross proceeds will be significantly different on Federaland non-Federal leases.''  <T3>MMS Response.</T3> The MMS agrees that royalty terms in leases betweenprivate land owners and coal operators, or between States and coal operators,may differ significantly from Federal lease royalty terms. However, theapplicability of these proposed rules is limited to Federal and IndianTribal and allotted coal leases. See andSection; 206.250. Similarly, valuationprocedures or instructions contained in private or State leases do notpertain to Federal or Indian leases. It is the lessee's obligation to ensurethat in situations of mixed mineral ownership, coal production is properlyallocated between Federal, Indian and non-Federal and non-Indian leases. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Section-by-Section Analysis and Response to Comments  </ITAG>Comments were not received on every section of the proposed regulations.Therefore, if any of those sections were not changed significantly fromthe proposal, there generally is no further discussion in this preamble.The preambles to the proposed regulation published on January 15, 1987(52 FR 1840), and on July 15, 1988 (53 FR 26942) may be consulted for afull description of the purposes of those sections. For other sections,this preamble will address primarily the extent to which the final rulewas changed from the proposal. Again, a complete discussion of the applicablesections may be found in the preamble to the proposed regulation.  Section 202250 Overriding royalty interest.  <T3>Comment.</T3> Two comments, one from industry and one from a Federalagency, were received concerning overriding royalties. One commenter stated,``[A]lthough regulations limiting overriding royalties are in existence,the wholesale treatment of 43 CFR Part 3400 to override royalties cannotbe done without violating express contractual rights of the owners of theoverriding royalty interests.'' The other commenter asked, ``[W]hat arethe procedures for handling a case where the company grants an overridingroyalty to another individual or company?''  <T3>MMS Response.</T3> Regulations pertaining to overriding royalty interestsare presently found at both 30 CFR 203.200(b) and 43 CFR 3485.2(b). Thisrulemaking eliminates the redundant regulatory provisions from 30 CFR 203.200(b)(redesignated as 30 CFR 202.250) and clarifies that BLM is the proper agencyto approve overriding royalty interests. See 43 CFR 3473.3-2 (1987). Thespecific provisions of 43 CFR 3485.2(b) are unaffected by these rules.Questions regarding procedures for obtaining approval of overriding royaltyinterests or similar types of production payments should be directed toBLM.  Section 206.250 Purpose and scope.  <T3>Comment.</T3> Following the January 15, 1987, proposed rulemaking,MMS received 18 comments from nine industry respondents and two Indianrespondents on proposed andSection; 206.250. One industry commenter recommendedno change to the language of this proposed section. Four industry commentersagreed with paragraph (a). However, these same commenters also stated MMShad lost sight of the goals of valuing production stated in paragraph (a)later in its regulations by requiring royalty to be paid on take-or-paypayments. Two Indian commenters disagreed with the thrust of paragraph(a) stating that coal production from Indian tribal and allotted leasesshould not be valued under the same criteria as Federal coal production.One Indian commenter stated that MMS had neglected to set forth in theproposed regulations MMS's trust responsibilities to the Indians. One industrycommenter requested that the MMS ``explain in the preamble to the finalrules that coal must be allocated to each particular lease in the courseof product valuation and royalty assessment.''  <T3>MMS Response.</T3> In response to the concerns expressed by the Indians,MMS modified andSection; 206.250 by adding paragraph (d) to this sectionto explicitly acknowledge the United States' trust responsibilities tothe Indians. That modification was published in the July 15, 1988, notice. In response to this modification MMS received several comments from Indiansexpressing approval.   The MMS believes the new valuation regulations, with the changes discussedin more detail below, are one way of meeting with the Secretary's obligationsto Indian lessors.  With respect to industry comments regarding royalty on production, MMShas revised its position with respect to take-or-pay payments. See discussionabove.  <T3>Comment: </T3>The MMS received two comments, one industry and one Indian,on proposed andSection;206.250(c). One commenter agreed with the proposedrule, finding that all royalty payments should be subject to audit andadjustment. The Indian commenter stated that ``MMS' past audit record doesnot reassure the tribes that all royalties due will be collected.''  <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The issuance of more detailed and clarified valuationregulations, as intended by these rules, will further enhance the productivityof MMS auditors.  <T3>Section 206.251 Definitions  </T3>The MMS received several comments on the proposed definitions in andSection;206.251.Not all of the definitions received significant additional comments. Also,comments on definitions already were addressed in the July 15 notice. Followingare most of the original comments and MMS's responses.  ``Ad valorem lease'' <T3>Comment: </T3>Some industry respondents recommended deletion of thewords ``amount or'' from the proposed definition of ``ad valorem lease.''One commenter explained: ``Amount of production is only relevant in a take-in-kindroyalty provisions [sic]. There is no authorization for such a provisionin the MLA [Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended].''  <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The phrase ``based upon a percentage of the amountor value of the production'' is appropriate because Indian leases may includea royalty-in-kind proviso. Because these rules pertain to both Federaland Indian coal production, it is proper to include regulatory languagethat provides for this possibility.  ``Allowance'' <T3>Comment: </T3>The phrase ``Coal washing allowance'' appears in theseproposed rules as an integral part of the definition of ``Allowance.''Many industry respondents recommended expanding the scope of the definitionand changing the term ``coal washing allowance'' to ``coal processing allowance.''One commenter stated that this change was necessary to be consistent withthe proposed revisions to andSection;206.260 [redesignated in the July 15,1988, notice as andSection;andSection;206.258 and 206.259]. Many other commenterssupported the proposed expansion for various similar reasons includingthe suggestions that ``an allowance should be extended to all processingcosts incurred downstream from the point of royalty determination'' andto ``other methods of beneficiation which may increase the value of coal* * *.'' Examples provided as other forms of processing included pelletizing,treatment with chemicals or oil, drying, crushing, and sizing.  <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS acknowledges the existence of developingcoal quality enhancement techniques other than the commercially availablecoal washing process. However, rather than transplant coal washing allowanceprocedures to other coal beneficiation technologies, MMS believes it ispreferable to provide a rule that recognizes coal beneficiation processesother than coal washing for royalty valuation purposes. Section 206.265was added to the July 15, 1988, notice to address these comments. The discussionof andSection;206.265 appears later in this preamble.  <T3>Comment: </T3>One Indian commenter recommended deleting ``all referencesto washing allowances,'' and maintained that the basic premise of the regulationsis that the lessee ``is obligated to place the mineral in its first marketablecondition.'' In support of this position, this commenter stated: ``Theincorporation of a practice which is primarily a conservation measure doesnot belong in regulations to value the product for royalty purposes.''This commenter concluded that such decisions as approving washing allowancesshould be the responsibility of ``the agency leasing the minerals.''  <T3>MMS Response: </T3>Coal washing is not necessarily practiced as anexclusive conservation measure. It is feasible for coal operators to washcoal to upgrade a first marketable product. Because the net effect of coalwashing is to increase heat content and to provide a cleaner burning productby removal of ash and sulfur, an operator may desire to wash coal to extendits market reach or expand its potential customer base. The MMS considersany attempt to differentiate between washing as a conservation measure(to develop a first marketable product) and washing as a marketing tacticto be a needless expenditure of MMS's limited manpower resources. Allowanceshave been provided to coal lessees that wash Federal coal since the inceptionof ad valorem royalty rates. Indian coal washing has never occurred. However,allowances for washing Indian coal would equally apply. These rules increasethe level of detail necessary to obtain coal washing allowances but otherwisewould continue existing policy.  <T3>Comment: </T3>Some industry respondents recommended deleting the ``reasonableness''standard. The proposed definition provided for a coal washing allowancebased on the ``reasonable, actual costs.'' One commenter explained that``there is no indication of what would be considered reasonable or unreasonable.We believe that the concept of `reasonableness' is inherent in all of thelessee's obligations under these regulations.''  <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS nomally considers any cost incurred forcoal washing or transportation that is out of proportion to standard industrypractices to be unreasonable. However, this statement may be tempered bythe specific situation that created the unusual (and possibly unreasonable)costs. In any event, because the commenter acknowledges that the conceptof reasonableness is present in all lessee's obligations, it seems no greateran imposition to explicitly state the term in the regulation.  <T3>Comment: </T3>A few industry respondents recommended substituting theword ``value'' for the word ``cost,'' because, as stated by one commenter,``it is the <T3>value </T3>of the coal processing activity that should be allowed byMMS_not just its cost.''  <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS believes these commenters have misconstruedthe thrust of the regulations. The royalty owner and the lessee share inthe value-enhancing of coal washing or coal transportation. As a matterof policy MMS has determined that it is appropriate to continue participationin the costs of washing or transporting the production from either Federalor Indian coal leases. Participating in washing or transportation costsin the form of allowances results in a net reduction of the royalty payment,which is in itself a cost to the lessor. Therefore, the value of coal washingor transportation to the royalty owner is the increased value of the productsold, less the incurred costs to wash and/or transport coal.  The phrase ``Transportation allowance'' also appears in these rules asan integral part of the definition of ``Allowance.'' Several industry respondentsprovided comments on this proposed definition. Many of the same commentswere received as discussed above with respect to the phrase ``coal washingallowance.'' These will not be addressed again.  <T3>Comment: </T3>One industry commenter recommended ``that the final regulationsshould be amended to provide an allowance for all transportation costs.''No elaboration or explanation was provided.  One industry commenter recommended that the rules should provide that ``alessee may claim a transportation allowance * * * if a lessee is compelledfor geographical, topographical, or other reasons to transport coal froma lease to mine facilities off the lease where it is sold.'' This commentalso suggested granting a transportation allowance under any circumstanceswhere coal is transported more than one mile from the Federal lease. OneState commenter suggested that all transportation operations, on or offthe lease, even if it is in-mine haulage, should be granted transportationallowances if the transportation occurs after the coal is in marketablecondition. Another State commenter concluded that MMS should ensure thattransportation allowances are not granted for in-mine haulage.  One industry commenter recommended that the transportation regulationsshould take into account the situation where in-mine transportation occurs,but the coal being transported is from another adjacent, but distinct,mine. This commenter concluded that transportation in this situation shouldbe eligible for an allowance. Two other commenters, one State and one Indian,similarly recommended inserting the word ``necessary,'' such that the affectedportion of the regulation would read ``means an allowance for the reasonable,actual, necessary costs incurred by the lessee * * *.''      A few industry commenters recommended that the term ``remote'' is ambiguousand requires clarification. Two of these commenters also claimed the term``mine'' required clarification. No suggestions as to additional clarifyinglanguage were offered. <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS recognizes that transportation costs resultingfrom the movement of coal throughout the mine complex can be a significantcost. Transportation costs are, in fact, a large factor in determiningwhether a coal deposit can be mined. The lessor has historically not participated in the cost of mining, includingthe costs of normal mine processing operations and any necessary movementof mined material about the mine area. The lessor has historically sharedin the cost of outbound (long-distance) transportation where sales occurat the destination rather than the mine. This existing policy is proposedto be continued with further clarification to distinguish those situationswhere the lessor should participate in the cost of transportation. The following questions are posed to implement a clarified policy regardingtransportation allowances. 1. Does coal transportation occur in what could reasonably be consideredthe vicinity of the mine, lease, etc., which is defined by some administrativeboundary or definition? An affirmative response to this question would constitute de facto minehaulage and would not qualify for a transportation allowance. Coal movementoutside the lease boundary from where it was extracted but inside a largerencompassing mine boundary is not unusual. Any coal movement about themine premise and between mine processing facilities is at the directionof the mine manager, who ultimately exercises control over the flow ofcoal from the point of extraction through all processing circuits and loadoutfacilities. 2. Is the coal transportation considered a normal mining operation? Coal movement from the pits (in the case of a surface mine) or the portals(in the case of an underground mine) to crushing facilities, preparationplants, surge bins, stockpiles, silos or other storage, loading, or salesfacilities of the mine is common trade practice and considered part ofthe mining operation. The Minerals Management Service recognizes that it is not only a necessaryindustry practice to move coal to and from the various processing facilitiesbut to also arrange for coal to enter the stream of commerce and for possessionto transfer to the buyer. Transportation recognized as necessary to theoperation of the mine would not qualify for transportation allowances.3. Does the transportation of coal occur prior to the first point whereproduction can reasonably be marketed? The mine operator is responsible for arranging for the sale and transferof coal to buyers in the marketplace. The first point where coal may bemarketed is the point where title, possession, and liability of loss cantransfer from the mine operator to buyers. This point is normally the mineloadout facility. 4. Are there any extraordinary or exceptional circumstances involving coaltransportation that should be considered as relevant factors or that couldrender other transportation allowance eligibility criteria invalid? Under normal mining conditions, all transportation occurring prior to anf.o.b. (free-on-board) mine sales point would be born exclusively by thelessee. However, under unusual arrangements or circumstances that createtransportation costs that are uncommon or which are beyond the establishednorm for that area, a transportation allowance could be granted. The MMS has no intent to provide transportation allowances for routinein-mine transportation costs, which every mining operation encounters tosome degree. In-mine transportation is an integral part of the total miningprocess, the cost of which the Federal or Indian owner has historicallynot shared. Additional discussion of transportation allowances appearslater in this preamble. The MMS notes, however, that under the definitionof ``mine,'' no allowance would be approved for coal transported betweenmine facilities, including, for instance, transportation between the pit(or portals, in the case of an underground mine) and the crusher, or fortransfer from the crusher to other mine surface facilities, including thestorage and loadout facility. The requirement of a lessee to perform this normal in-mine haulage at nocost to the lessor is sometimes lost because the nature of mineral occurrencedoes not always lend itself to convenient clustering of mine facilities.Other competing factors such as access to electrical power, water, andlong-distance transportation corridors, e.g., railroads, highways, or politicalor topographical constraints often require compromised mine design. The MMS has surveyed the various types of minerals produced from mineson Federal and Indian leases and have found that all lessees engage insome degree of mine haulage and normal processing to produce a marketableproduct at no expense to the lessor. The MMS routinely considers theseactivities as occurring ``at the mine,'' even though the mine's facilitiesare not necessarily near the point of extraction. ``Area'' <T3>Comment:</T3> Two industry respondents stated that the definition wasneither relevant nor precise. <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS finds the term ``area'' to be relevant becauseof its use in andSection;andSection;206.257(c)(2) (i) and (ii), which setsforth the first two valuation criteria for non-arm's-length sales. Underthe approach, lessees will use values established under comparable arm's-lengthcoal sales contracts for coal with similar economic and quality characteristicsfound in the same geographic region. Therefore, for example, a lessee inNorth Dakota seeking to establish a value for its non-arm's-length coalsales could not resort to coal sales contracts in Colorado as a means ofestablishing a royalty value. ``Arm's-length contract'' The definition of ``arm's-length contract generatednumerous comments following the January 15, 1987, original proposed rulemaking.The definition in that earlier proposal would have found a controllinginterest regardless of how small the ownership between the two personswas. The July 15, 1988, notice amended the earlier proposed definition.``Arm's-length contract'' is defined as a contract or agreement that hasbeen arrived at in the marketplace between independent, nonaffiliated personswith opposing economic interests regarding that contract. Affiliation essentiallywould be a control test; ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutescontrol; ownership of 10 through 50 percent creates a presumption of control;and ownership of less than 10 percent creates a presumption of noncontrolwhich MMS can rebut. Contracts between relatives would not be arm's-lengthcontracts. To be considered arm's-length for any production month, a contractmust meet the requirements of the definition for that month as well aswhen the contract was executed. Thus, if two contracting parties were notaffiliated when the contract was executed, but are affiliated now, thecontract would be non-arm's-length. Alternatively, if two parties were affiliated and executed a non-arm's-lengthcontract, but subsequently divested ownership in one-another, that contractwould continue to be regarded as non-arm's-length until such time thatthe contract terminates or is replaced by a contract negotiated at arm's-length.<T3>Comment:</T3> One State commenter proposed an alternative definitionthat would not include the issue of control. This commenter also statedthat regardless of which definition is adopted, ``MMS should retain theability to review contracts [for their arm's-length status] as they relateto current sales.''A few industry commenters stated that MMS's ``Arm's-length contract'' definitionwas too reliant on form rather than substance. These commenters assertedthat where a contract was agreed upon when the parties were nonaffiliatedand that contract has continued unamended even though the parties havesince become affiliated, the contract should be viewed as ``arm's-length.''<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The July 15, 1988, proposed definition is retainedunchanged in the final rules. The arm's-length test must be met each productionmonth. Contracts entered into by independent parties lose their arm's-lengthstatus when the contracting parties become affiliated. Clearly, any contractsigned by former unaffiliated parties would only continue to operate underthe permission of the controlling entity, if the entity's best interestis served. The MMS does not consider such a contract to be arm's-length.``Audit'' <T3>Comment</T3>: Several industry respondents and one Indian respondentsubmitted numerous comments regarding the January 15, 1987, proposed definitionof this term. Three industry commenters requested clarification regardingwho conducts audits of royalty payments and on what date an audit wouldbe deemed final. Two industry commenters stated a need to clarify thisdefinition's relation to the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Actof 1982 (FOGRMA). One Indian commenter stated that the phrase ``productionverification'' should also be defined. One commenter stated that MMS shouldbe required to disseminate audit findings to Indian tribes and allottees``as their needs arise.''<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS is the prime auditing authority of coalroyalty payments from either Federal or Indian coal lessees. States andIndians may also audit coal royalty payments under the provisions of individuallyexecuted cooperative agreements. The results of an audit are normally consideredfinal when the lessee accepts the audit findings or its appeal rights areexhausted. The Federal Government is not prevented from reopening an auditif there is evidence of substantial omission or fraud. The definition inthe July 15, 1988, notice modified the January 15, 1987, proposed definitionby deleting all language following the first sentence of the definition.The deleted material was only intended to be explanatory. These final rulescontain the July 15, 1988, proposed definition unchanged from that proposal.``Coal washing'' <T3>Comment:</T3> Several respondents provided comments concerning thisdefinition. Several industry commenters recommended revising this definitionfrom ``Coal washing'' to ``Coal processing.'' Support for this modificationprovided in these comments followed the same rationale as stated earlier:Other methods of beneficiation besides coal washing may increase the valueof coal. One commenter further explained, ``The definition of coal washingshould be rewritten to clarify that these processes are included and provideincentives to develop new technologies for increased or different federalcoal use.'' One Indian commenter recommended deleting the definition entirelybut offered no reasoning.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS responded to these issues earlier at thediscussion of the term ``Allowance.''<T3>Comment:</T3> The MMS received many comments from industry respondentsstating that all preparation costs should be excluded from the royaltyvalue.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The details of these comments and MMS's responseto them were published in the July 15, 1988 (53 FR 26942), notice. Thereader should refer to the referenced issue of the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>The final rules maintain the longstanding requirement for the lessee toplace the mined product in marketable condition at no expense to the lessor.An extensive discussion of the ``marketable condition'' requirement iscontained earlier in this preamble.``Contract'' <T3>Comment:</T3> Several industry respondents provided comments recommendingdeletion of the phrase ``that with due consideration creates an obligation''from the proposed definition. Two commenters stated the phrase was ``unnecessaryand confusing.''<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS considers the elements of considerationand obligation to be fundamental elements of coal sales contracts. Theserules retain the language of the January 15, 1987, proposed rulemaking.``Gross proceeds'' <T3>Comment</T3>: Following the original January 15, 1987, proposed rulemaking,MMS received many comments on the definition of ``Gross proceeds.'' Manycomments were concerned with the proposal to exclude the AML fee and BlackLung excise tax from the value of coal. An extensive description of thosecomments appeared in the preamble to the July 15, 1988 (53 FR 26942), notice.Readers should refer to the referenced issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> to review those comments and MMS's response.Comments received since the July 15, 1988, notice regarding the inclusionor exclusion of the AML fee, Black Lung excise tax, and other taxes orfees are addressed in the discussion of andSection; 206.257(b).<T3>MMS Response: </T3>There is no doubt, for example, that when the purchaserpays $10/ton for coal, that is the lessee's gross proceeds. Whether allof that $10 is royalty-bearing is a separate issue and is addressed belowin andSection; 206.257(b).<T3>Comment: </T3>Many commenters including States, Indians, and industry,commented that they favored recognizing all forms of consideration receivedby the lessee for purposes of valuing Federal and Indian coal. Severalindustry respondents opposed the concept of including noncash forms ofconsideration such as providing crushing or loading services to the lessee.One commenter maintained: ``There may be occasions when there truly issignificant consideration given to the seller which is not included inthe actual sales price of the coal. When that is the case, then there isjustification to collect royalty on such consideration.'' This commenterconcluded, however, that the proposed rules do not define what is significant.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS partially responded to this issue as itwas raised in the discussion of ``grandfathering.'' The MMS's policy isrestated again to be very clear on this issue. The MMS has always requiredroyalty to be paid on all components of produced coal value, includingthose components of a coal sales agreement that are not in the form ofcash and are not imbedded in the price. As stated in the January 15, 1987,proposed rulemaking, ``The definition of gross proceeds is intended tobe expansive to ensure that it includes all the benefits flowing from thepurchaser to, or on behalf of, the seller for the disposition of the coal* * *.''The rationale for this policy is that a mine operator can benefit equallyfrom transactions involving noncash as well as cash benefits. In otherwords, cost avoidance can contribute as much to overall firm profitabilityas incoming revenues can. However, the royalty owner likewise is entitledto receive a share of the noncash value components received by the lessee.Any other proposition is unacceptable because the outcome would clearlyrepresent royalty assessed on an amount that represents less than the fullvalue of coal.<T3>Comment: </T3>Many industry commenters stated that the use of ``grossproceeds valuation'' does not have a basis in law. One commenter supportedthis position by stating that, ``The words `gross proceeds' do not appearin the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. Section 7 of the Act, as amended in1976, established a royalty based on coal's value.'' This reasoning wasexpressed as support in other comments.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>Section 7 of the MLA, as amended by FCLAA, requiresroyalty to be paid on ``the value of coal as defined by regulations.''The regulations in effect since 1976 have required royalty to be basedon ``gross value.'' Although the ``gross proceeds'' term herein is new,it is not forwarding a new concept. The selection of the term ``gross proceeds''is to assure regulatory consistency within MMS and is an exercise of discretionprovided by statute.<T3>Comment: </T3>Some industry commenters stated that MMS should not usethe gross proceeds established under contracts signed in the 1970's. Onerespondent commented that ``These negotiated coal prices are over-inflatedand not indicative of fair market value. They were contracted during the`oil crisis' and the moratoriums on federal coal leasing.'' The commenteradvocates that MMS ``should develop a method that takes into account theaverage coal price at each mine and does not consider those 1970's contractsas indicative of fair market value.'' Another industry commenter offeredan alternative proposal where royalty would be based on the average priceof a geographic area if ``the current `arm's-length' price exceeds theaverage price for coal sold in the same geographic area by 20 percent ormore * * *.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>For arm's-length contracts, MMS does not believethat there is any justification for receiving a royalty based on less thana contract sales price regardless of when the contract was signed. Thelessee receives the benefit of a higher price and the royalty owner isentitled to share in that benefit. Non-arm's-length situations are addressedlater in this preamble. Interestingly, a similar issue was raised severaldecades ago. The conclusion was as follows: ``Prices specified in contractsmade years ago, but still effective, are just as significant a part ofpresent markets for natural gas as those made yesterday, or those whichmay be made tomorrow.'' (Federal Power Commission, Natural Gas Investigation222 [Docket No. G-580, 1948]).Many comments were received on the take-or-pay issue prior to the July15, 1988 (53 FR 26942), notice. Those comments were summarized in thisreferenced notice and will not be repeated here.Numerous comments on the take-or-pay issue were received since the July15, 1988, notice. The MMS responded to the issue of take-or-pay paymentsand similar type payments earlier in this preamble. The MMS's responsealso explains changes to the ``gross proceeds'' definition that have beenmade to conform to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision regardingtake-or-pay.The remaining definition of gross proceeds remains unchanged from the July15, 1988, notice.The definition of ``gross proceeds'' includes the total monies and otherconsideration ``accruing'' to the lessee. Because the definition of arm's-lengthcontract does not include any provisions which address the concept thatsuch contracts must reflect the entirety of the agreement between the parties,MMS concluded that the definition of gross proceeds should be sufficientlybroad to encompass all consideration to which the lessee is entitled. Theterm ``accruing'' is intended to accomplish this purpose.``Lease'' <T3>Comment: </T3>Seven industry and one Indian respondent submitted commentsregarding this proposed definition. One commenter stated that the definitionwas too broad, and six other commenters advocated redefining the term toexclude arrangements that are not leases, such as profit-sharing arrangementsor joint ventures. Three other commenters suggested that MMS should adoptBLM's definition of lease as found at 43 CFR 3400.0-5(r), stating thatthere was no need for two bureaus of the same Department to have differentdefinitions of the same term.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The definition of ``Lease'' is largely a restatementof the definition of that term as defined by various statutes.``Lessee'' <T3>Comment: </T3>Ten industry commenters stated that the definition wastoo broad and ``subject to misconception,'' and that MMS should redefinethis term to eliminate persons who pay royalties but have no interest inthe lease. As explained by one commenter, ``It [the definition] could,for instance, include as a `lessee' a coal buyer who in the coal salescontract agrees to reimburse the coal miner for royalties payable.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The term ``lessee'' as defined in these rules doesnot extend to an unaffiliated coal buyer, which under a coal sales contractagrees to reimburse the lessee for royalty expenses. The lessee cannotcontract away an obligation created by the taking of a lease. Further,failure of a coal buyer to render payment to the lessee does not relievethe lessee of its obligation to submit royalty payments for coal sold froma Federal or Indian coal lease. The definition does, however, include acoal buyer who agrees to report and pay the royalty to the MMS.``Like-quality coal'' <T3>Comment: </T3>One industry respondent questioned the meaning of theword ``similar.'' Specifically, the comment asked how much variation inthe chemical and physical characteristics would be allowed within the term``similar.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>In general, MMS would consider two coals to be similarif they fall within the same coal classification, as set forth by The AmericanSociety for Testing Materials (ASTM) Standard D-388. However, MMS cautionsthat these general tolerances for the similarity test are not conclusive.Btu, ash, sulfur, and moisture content, and in specific situations othertests such as washability, drop shatter test, test for water soluble alkalior other tests may be necessary to conclude similarity.``Net-back method'' <T3>Comment: </T3>Numerous industry respondents submitted comments on theproposed definition that was contained in the January 15, 1987, proposedrulemaking. Two commenters advocated taking into consideration only theactual cost of transportation, thus eliminating costs such as coal handling,washing, etc., from the net-back calculations. One commenter suggestedchanging the definition to mean a procedure for valuing produced coal atthe mine-mouth when a sale has taken place downstream from the lease ormine. Similarly, other commenters who advocated the ``depletion income''valuation method offered an alternative proposal by defining the term tomean ``a procedure for valuing coal downstream from the lease or mine workingback from the point of gross royalty valuation to arrive at net royaltyvalue at the first point of marketable condition.'' Any transportation,washing, or handling services would not be included in the ``net royaltyvalue.'' One commenter stated that the definition should be deleted asit is unnecessary under its proposed alternative ``fair market value approach.''One commenter stated that the ``point of measurement for royalty purposes''is not specified in the definition and questioned how that point wouldbe determined. One commenter recommended modifying the definition ``torecognize that it is a procedure for determining the value of coal at thepoint of extraction.'' This commenter advocated also including ``all portionsof the value added to the coal as a result of post-extractive processes.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The definition in the July 15, 1988, notice whichhas been carried forward unchanged in these final rules, substantiallyrevised the earlier proposal. The MMS will not permit any expense incurredprior to the point where the mineral is placed in marketable conditionto be included in a net-back valuation method. To permit otherwise wouldcontradict long-standing Department of the Interior policy and would denyequal royalty treatment to other lessees, which cannot avail themselvesof a net-back valuation procedure. Therefore, the definition containedin this rulemaking has been streamlined but the concept is unchanged. TheMMS will use a net-back valuation method only when other methods of determiningvalue, such as those specified in the rules, are inapplicable. In doinga net-back, MMS will start at the first point at which a market value forthe product can be determined, and will deduct costs of transportation,washing, handling, etc. to reach a value for royalty purposes.``Net output'' <T3>Comment: </T3>Two industry respondents requested that the term be redefinedto mean ``the quantity of coal delivered to the purchaser.'' The commentersupported this change to ``make the definition more accurate and readable.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS believes the term ``produced'' providesmore flexibility and accuracy by including such situations as retentionof washed coal by the on-site washer for purposes of drying coal or spaceheating.``Person'' <T3>Comment: </T3>Three industry respondents requested that the definitionbe revised. Two advocated changing the definition to read `` `Person' meansany individual or legal entity.'' One commenter justified the proposedchange by stating that ``This revision is intended to make the definitionlegally sound, less confusing and less subject to being misconstrued.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS's definition of ``person'' is consistentwith sound legal principles and other statutes. ``Selling arrangement'' <T3>Comment: </T3>Several industry respondents commented that this definition'smeaning and purpose in the regulations are unclear and should be deleted.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The term ``selling arrangement'' is used in andSection;206.262 ``Transportation allowances-general.'' The purpose of the term,as it is used in the rule, is to prohibit the transfer of transportationcosts incurred under one particular sale to other sales not involving transportedcoal. It also clarifies that although present royalty reporting requirementsfor Form MMS-4014 allow aggregated reporting of sales, for purposes ofallowances these deductions will be by individual contractual sales arrangement.These final rules adopt the July 15, 1988, notice definition. ``Severance tax''_Because these final rules adopt Recommendation VII-5of the Commission on Fair Market Value Policy for Federal Coal Leasingthat ``the base for calculating Federal royalty payments should be thef.o.b. price minus all State and local severance and similar taxes,'' adefinition of ``Severance tax'' has been added to this section. The intentof this definition is that only State and local production-related taxesmay be excluded from the Federal coal lessee's gross proceeds and thatother taxes and royalties may not be excluded. ``Spot market price''_The July 15, 1988, notice included a definition of``spot market price.'' Although no comments were received on this definition,MMS wishes to make clear its intent through the following explanation.The definition provides: ``The price received under any sales transactionwhen planned or actual deliveries span a short period of time, usuallynot exceeding one year.'' The term ``planned'' is used because duly executedspot sales contracts providing for near term future sales would be evidenceof market value at that time. This definition is adopted unchanged in the final rules. Section 206.262 Information collection <T3>Comment: </T3>One industry and one Indian respondent commented on MMS'sproposed information collection requirements. The industry commenter stated,``Collection of washing and transportation allowance data is unnecessarywith a market value test'' valuation, as opposed to a gross proceeds requirement.(The detailed discussion of alternative valuation proposals is containedat andSection; 206.257(b).) The Indian commenter requested that MMS ``clarifythat this information will be available to Indian tribes on request foruse in tribal management programs.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS will respond to the alternative valuationprocedures in the responses to comments at andSection; 206.257(b). With respectto the sharing of mineral lease data with Indians, it is MMS policy toprovide the Indian lessor any information relevant to its specific Indianleases, provided the Indian lessor agrees to safeguard certain proprietaryfinancial and trade information. Section 206.253 Coal subject to royalties_General provisions <T3>Comment: </T3>The MMS received many comments from numerous industryrespondents and one Indian respondent concerning proposed andSection; 206.253.One industry commenter recommended that no changes be made to this section.Numerous industry respondents submitted many comments objecting to theprovisions of paragrpah (a). Five commenters stated that only coal producedunder a resource recovery and protection plan should be subject to royalty.One commenter explained that ``BLM approves of the lessee's Resource Recoveryand Protection Plan and thereby approves of the quality and quantity ofthat coal which must be recovered * * *.'' The commenter ``urged that therules provide that so long as the Resource Recovery and Protection Planis being achieved, no royalties be charged for coal which is not minedpursuant to that plan.'' Four other commenters stated paragraph (a) wasa duplication of BLM's existing authority for Maximum Economic Recovery(MER). One commenter noted, ``The BLM's Maximum Economic Recovery regulationsalready serve to define how the reserve will be produced.'' One commenterobjected to paragraph (a), stating that the requirement to pay royalties``on coal avoidably lost does not take into consideration the real worldof mine operation and business.'' Indian commenters stated royalty shouldbe due on all coal, including that coal unavoidably lost. Five other commentersstated that paragraph (a) was inadequate in other respects. One Indiancommenter stated that this paragraph failed to deal with theft. Two othercommenters stated it did not adequately define ``avoidably lost.'' Onecommenter stated this paragraph would impose a royalty on coal too thinto mine or too poor a quality to use at a utility plant. One industry commenterstated that paragraph (a) refers to coal ``which is `unavoidably lost asdetermined by BLM pursuant to 43 CFR Group 3400' '' but noted that ``theGroup 3400 regulations do not address the concept of `unavoidably lost.''' <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The BLM determines the quantity of coal subjectto royalty under its production verification responsibilities. Section206.253(a) does not duplicate or usurp BLM's responsibilities pursuantto 43 CFR Group 3400. MMS points out, however, that coal avoidably lostis subject to BLM's scrutinty under 43 CFR Group 3400 performance standards.Coal which cannot be produced for various reasons, and is not mined, incompliance with the BLM-approved Resource Recovery and Protection Planwould not be subject to royalty. However, the Federal or Indian lessordoes not bear the economic burden of absorbing losses due to the actionsof an imprudent operator. In regards to theft, BLM may consider stolencoal avoidably lost and thus subject to royalty. One industry commenter stated that although MMS uses the word ``produced''in paragraph (a), the word is not defined in the proposed regulations.This commenter also offered a definition: ``[C]oal is produced for royaltypurposes when it is severed and placed in commercially salable condition,and then either sold, consumed, or otherwise disposed of.'' This commenterfurther noted that the use of the term ``produced'' in paragraph (a) wasinconsistent with the gross proceeds approach of the regulations. <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS accepts the common usage and meaning ofthe word ``produced,'' and believes no definiton in the regulations isnecessary. The MMS discussed this issue in greater depth in the generalcomments regarding take-or-pay and similar type payments. The MMS agreeswith the commenter that coal ``produced'' is relevant to coal that maybe used by the lessee on-lease or off-lease, but not sold. The intent of paragraph (a) is to make clear that royalty is due when coalis used, sold, or otherwise produced and disposed of by the lessee on oroff the lease. These final rules include, unchanged, the regulation asit was proposed in the July 15, 1988, notice. <T3>Comment: </T3>One industry comment stated that coal, free-of-charge,is provided to the Indian lessor. This commenter noted that royalty shouldnot be charged on that coal. <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS understands that coal provided free-of-chargeto the Indian lessor is explicitly provided for by lease terms. These rulesexplicitly provide for lease terms to govern where specifically inconsistentwith these rules. See andSection; 206.250(b). <T3>Comment: </T3>Several industry respondents provided comments discussingparagraph (b). Two commenters requested that MMS clarify the language ofparagraph (b) to state that insurance payments received by the lessee forlosses other than coal would not be royalty bearing. One commenter suggestedadding the phrase ``for the coal lost'' to the end of paragraph (b) asit was proposed. <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The regulations published in the January 15, 1987(52 FR 1840), proposed rulemaking were changed in the July 15, 1988 (53FR 26942), notice to clarify MMS's intent on this issue. Royalty will bedue only on insurance monies received by the lessee for the loss of coal.Royalty will not be due on insurance monies received for replacement ofequipment or real estate. The July 15, 1988, notice language has been adoptedin the final rules. <T3>Comment: </T3>One industry commenter questioned if it were necessary``to determine if the insurance contract is arm's-length and go throughthe procedures of 30 CFR 206.257?'' <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS believes that the issue of arm's-lengthversus non-arm's-length insurance payments is not relevant in this situation.In the instance of coal avoidably lost, MMS would determine the value ofthe coal pursuant to andSection; 206.257. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two industry commenters stated that no royalty was dueon insurance proceeds. One commenter explained, ``An insurance paymentis a contractual agreement between the lessee and a third party by whichthe lessee has shifted the risk of losses to the third party through thepayment of certain insurance premiums.'' A few industry commenters statedthat the lessor should carry its own insurance or share in the lessee'sinsurance premiums if the lessor wished to indemnify itself from losses.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>Royalty is due on insurance proceeds because theinsurance payment compensates the lessee for the loss of Federal or Indiancoal. If not for the production and loss of the Federal or Indian coal,the lessee would not receive the insurance payment. Once severed from thelease, protecting coal is the responsibility of the lessee until risk ofloss has been transferred to the purchaser. Where the protection extendsto insurance coverage, that coverage also reduces the lessor's risk onthe royalty portion, which represents an undivided interest on all productionfrom Federal and Indian leases. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 206.253(c), which requires royalty to be paidon coal recovered from waste piles or slurry ponds, received several commentsfrom respondents. One commenter agreed with this paragraph. Two commentersstated that the record keeping requirements relating to the allocationof coal ``may be difficult since the `event' at issue may have occurred10-12 years in the past.'' <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The record keeping requirements are not new. Correctallocation of Federal and non-Federal production (or Indian/non-Indian)is a consistent obligation of lessees. See, for example, 30 CFR 211.63(k)of the July 30, 1982, Minerals Management Service final rulemaking forCoal Exploration and Mining Operations (47 FR 33192). If adequate recordshave been discarded over time, production estimates approved by BLM wouldbe sufficient for royalty determination purposes. <T3>Comment: </T3>One industry commenter posed the question of how to accountfor coal in waste pits, which was derived ``from multiple Federal leasesand both Federal and non-Federal lands?'' This commenter further maintainedthat the requirements of paragraph (c) are both ``unreasonable and unenforceable.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>Specific cases involving allocation issues willbe dealt with on a case-by-case basis. If complete production records werekept by the lessee, correct allocation of coal in waste pits will not bedifficult. <T3>Comment: </T3>One industry commenter recommended that ``there has beenno prior obligation to keep such records [as required by paragraph (c)].''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The commenter is incorrect. Production records havealways been required to be kept in order to verify coal production removedfrom a lease. See 30 CFR 211.63(k) (July 30, 1982) (47 FR 33192), MineralsManagement Service final rulemaking for Coal Exploration and Mining Operations.Prior to that rulemaking, see 30 CFR 211.66(a) (May 17, 1976) (41 FR 20271),final rulemaking. <T3>Comment: </T3>One industry commenter stated that paragraph (c) [andSection;206.255(c)] in the January 15, 1978, proposed rulemaking] should be revisedto reflect that royalties are due when coal is sold or used, ``not at thetime of recovery.'' <T3>MMS Response: </T3>This comment is reasonable and the regulations werechanged in July 15, 1988, notice to require royalty payments when the coalrecovered from waste or slurry ponds is used, sold, or otherwise disposed.This language has been carried through to the final rules. <T3>Comment: </T3>One industry commenter stated, ``MMS should address thepossible situation where waste piles and slurry ponds may contain coalproduced using both underground and surface methods.'' <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS will investigate such a situation when orif it occurs; however, MMS is convinced that if proper records were retainedby the lessee, correct allocation and royalty calculation is feasible.Section 206.254 Quality and quantity measurement standards for reportingand paying royalties<T3>Comment</T3>: Numerous industry respondents submitted comments relatingto andSection; 206.254. One commenter recommended no changes to this section.Nine respondents objected to the quality reporting standards set forthin paragraph (a). Two commenters believed the requirements of paragraph(a) are burdensome and recommended deletion. One commenter continued byasserting that ``MMS is requesting a great amount of unnecessary information.''Three other commenters similarly stated that there was ``no legitimategovernmental interest in receiving this information, particularly if thecoal is being sold pursuant to a bona fide arm's-length coal supply agreement.Federal coal royalties are calculated on quantity and price.'' <T3>MMS Response</T3>: Such information is necessary so that MMS may performits oversight functions. The MMS believes that such information shouldbe readily available for purposes of properly analyzing values used forcoal sold under non-arm's-length conditions. The valuation of coal soldunder non-arm's-length conditions normally requires a comparison to like-qualitycoal sold in the same area under arm's-length conditions. The requirementto provide such information to MMS is specified at 30 CFR Part 216. Thereporting regulations of andSection; 206.254(a) for coal are more specific,but do not impose additional requirements. <T3>Comment</T3>: Several commenters requested that MMS clarify paragraph(a) to require that quality information be submitted once a month for arepresentative shipment providing no extraordinary bonuses or penaltieswere incurred by the lessee during the month. <T3>MMS Response</T3>: Section 206.257 requires lessees to perform coalquality analysis at intervals set forth in their contracts, but in no caseless than quarterly. However, the reporting of those analyses to MMS shouldbe consistent with the standards contained in 30 CFR Part 216. The MMScontemplates that the weighted average of all shipments during a reportingperiod will be reported because coal lessees do not report the detailsof individual shipments unless only one shipment was made during the reportingperiod. <T3>Comment</T3>: One commenter requested that the provisions of paragraph(a) be revised to address ``the circumstance where the sales contract doesnot provide the intervals at which quality determinations will be made.''<T3>MMS Response</T3>: The MMS concurred with the comment and accordinglyincorporated clarifying language in the July 15, 1988, notice. For thegeneral case in which a sales contract does not provide the intervals atwhich quality determinations will be made, quality tests will be performednot less than quarterly. <T3>Comment</T3>: One commenter recommended amending paragraph (a) suchthat the quarterly coal quality tests would only be required ``if coalon which royalty is due was mined during that period.'' <T3>MMS Response</T3>: Quality tests would be performed at intervals specifiedin the coal contract but not less than quarterly. The reporting of thosequality parameters should be consistent with the reporting requirementsof 30 CFR Part 216. MMS received a few comments concerning paragraph (b). The commenters recommendamending paragraph (b) to exclude ``extraneous ash and moisture [from theweight] (i.e., that not found to be inherent in the coal itself) beforecalculating royalties.'' The commenter cited <T3>A.J. Taft Coal Co. </T3>v. <T3>U.S., </T3>605 F. Supp. 366 (D. Ala. 1984), aff'd 760 F. 2d 279 (11thCir. 1985) in support of this proposal. Another commenter stated that theweight of water added for dust suppression should be deducted. <T3>MMS Response</T3>: Under the valuation rules, coal royalties are basedon gross proceeds. Thus, to the extent that ash and moisture penaltieseffect gross proceeds, the Federal or Indian lessor also shares in thereduced revenues received for the sale of coal containing excessive impurities.Additional discounts for coal weight contributed by impurities are inconsistentwith general principles of ad valorem royalty accounting, which principallyrely on revenue receipts for the sale of production rather than on theweight of production. The MMS similarly rejects the latter comment concerning a deduction forwater added for dust suppression. Ad valorem royalties are based on valueof coal sold in marketable condition. The commenter noted that an averageof 2 gallons of water is added to each ton of coal sold. The additional16 pounds of added water per ton of coal represents a weight increase ofabout 0.8 percent, an amount which is below the acceptable percentage oferror of tolerance present in many certified rail or truck scales. TheMMS also suggests that the costs of the additional recordkeeping requirementsthat would be necessary to support actual water weight applied to coalwould easily exceed royalty savings. Section 206.255 Point of royalty determinationSection 205.257 of the January 15, 1987, proposed rulemaking was redesignatedandSection; 206.255 in the July 15, 1988, notice. The language was also slightlyamended. The term ``used'' was added to the paragraphs (b) and (c) to makeit clear that use of coal by the lessee triggers the royalty payment obligation.Section 206.255 of the July 15, 1988, notice is adopted into these finalrules without change. <T3>Comment</T3>: The MMS received many comments from industry respondentsand one Federal agency concerning andSection; 206.255 (formerly andSection;206.257) published in the January 15, 1987, proposed rulemaking. Nine industryrespondents submitted numerous comments related to paragraph (a). One commenterstated that this paragraph was vague; another comment stated that it wasconfusing. One commenter specifically recommended deleting the phrase ``marketablecondition,'' and explained that the phrase was unnecessary where a specifiedpoint of royalty determination is designated. Ten comments offered alternativepoints of royalty measurement other than that ``prescribed by BLM.'' Threecommenters suggested that the point of royalty measurement should be afterthe coal is crushed and screened. One commenter believed this was a reasonablepoint since these operations were undertaken by all lessees. One commenterstated that the point of royalty measurement should occur ``at the pointat which the coal is severed from the mineral estate.'' One commenter suggestedsubstituting the term ``mine'' in place of ``point of royalty measurementprescribed by BLM.'' One commenter advocated that the point of royaltydetermination should be the first of either ``the point when coal is producedand first placed in a marketable condition or loaded for delivery.'' Onecommenter stated that the point of royalty measurement should be where``ownership is transferred at the point of sale.'' Two commenters statedthat the point of royalty determination should be the point of sale, normallyf.o.b. the mine. Another commenter also stated that there was no provisionfor the lessee to have input into this determination. <T3>MMS Response</T3>: The ``marketable condition'' standard is presentfor consistency with andSection; 206.257(h). The MMS will not accept, forroyalty purposes, the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for the arm's-lengthsale of coal which is not in marketable condition, as defined at andSection;206.251. The point of royalty determination is a joint BLM and MMS function.Often the point of sale specified in a sales contract is the same as thepoint of royalty determination, which is typically at or near the mine.The MMS expects that extensive consultation would occur between all concernedparties, including the lessee, prior to establishing a point of royaltydetermination. However, the final decision of a point of royalty determinationis not delegable to the lessee. Where unusual selling arrangements exist,BLM and MMS may, at their discretion, assign any point of royalty determination,including a point different from the point of sale contained in the salescontract.  <T3>Comment: </T3>Six comments from four industry respondents and one Federalagency were received on paragraph (b). The Federal agency suggested thatMMS should promulgate a definition for ``large coal stockpile.'' Two commentersrequested MMS to clarify what constitutes excessive stockpiles or inventory.Two of these commenters asked that MMS be flexible ``in these [excessivestockpiles or inventory] determinations since a 100,000-ton stockpile maybe `excessive' at one operation but may be quite normal at another.'' Onecommenter recommended substituting the word ``when'' for the word ``after,''stating that the current word is confusing. Two commenters agreed withMMS's paragraph (b). One commenter stated, ``Many of the recently readjustedFederal leases specify that royalties will continue to be paid at the timecoal is produced. It is suggested that the provisions of this section needto be further strengthened to clarify that this section will prevail overthe terms of the lease * * *.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS will be flexible in determining what constitutesan ``excessive stockpile.'' These determinations will be made on a case-by-casebasis by BLM. The MMS did not, however, strengthen paragraph (b) to prevailover lease terms. As contractual agreements, leases and their provisionsprevail over regulations where leases and regulations are inconsistent.<T3>Comment: </T3>Seven comments from six industry respondents were receivedon paragraph (c). One commenter recommended deleting this paragraph entirely,``since all Federal coal leases contain provisions for royalty rates andfrequency of payments.'' Six other commenters objected to the language``or otherwise disposed of.'' In lieu of this language, two commenterssuggested substituting the word ``consumed''; one commenter suggested substitutingthe word ``removed''; and one commenter suggested substituting ``or usedby the lessee on lease or off lease.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The purpose of paragraph (c) is to refer to 30 CFR206.256(d), which deals with practical situations for paying royalty whencoal is sold, used, or otherwise finally disposed of. The MMS considersthe phrase ``or otherwise disposed of'' necessary to anticipate other dispositionsof coal in addition to sale. The MMS does not intend this provision tomean that royalty normally is due when coal is removed from a lease andtransferred to a nearby stockpile prior to sale. The word ``sold'' wasadded to the provision to be consistent with other parts of these regulationswhich discuss disposition of Indian and Federal coal.Section 206.256 Valuation standards for cents-per-ton leases<T3>Comment: </T3>Several industry and one Indian respondent submittednine comments regarding andSection; 206.258 of the January 15, 1987, notice,now redesignated andSection; 206.256. The MMS received no comments on paragraph(a).Three industry respondents submitted three comments concerning paragraph(b). One commenter recommended that ``the word `volume' be replaced withthe word `quantity' to be consistent with proposed 30 CFR 206.254(b).''The other commenters were concerned with the requirement that royalty wouldbe due on coal avoidably lost. Two commenters questioned the conditionsunder which royalty would be due on coal left in-place (unmined) and onestated that paragraph (b) was essentially a ``duplicate regulation by theDepartment of Interior [sic] in that BLM already has existing authorityto assure maximum economic recovery * * *.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>Paragraph (b) was changed in the July 15, 1988,notice by replacing the word ``volume'' with the word ``quantity.'' ``Quantity''is consistent with usage at 30 CFR 206.254(b), because coal is not measuredfor royalty purposes by ``volume.'' Also, see MMS's response regardingcoal avoidably lost at andSection; 206.253.<T3>Comment: </T3>Three comments from industry respondents were receivedon paragraph (c). Two commenters recommended deleting this paragraph completely.The other commenter maintained that both washing and transportation allowancesshould be available for cents-per-ton leases. The commenter stated thatdenying allowances for only cents-per-ton leases ``create[s] a double standard.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The denial of allowances for cents-per-ton coallease does not create a double standard of royalty valuation. Cents-per-tonroyalty payments are not increased because of the value added benefitsof washed coal. The historic practice of collecting cents-per-ton royaltyon the quantity of cleaned coal rather than the quantity of uncleaned coalactually mined is continued. See initial policy at 30 CFR 211.64, May 17,1976, 41 FR 20271.<T3>Comment: </T3>Three industry and one Indian respondent submitted fivecomments pertaining to paragraph (d). One Indian comment commended MMSfor its position ``that it will be the policy * * * to convert cents-per-tonleases to ad valorem leases on readjustment dates unless, of course, acents-per-ton lease would yield greater royalties to an Indian tribe.''All other comments were put forth by industry. Two of these commentersrecommended deletion of this paragraph. One commenter reasoned ``that thisentire area [of lease readjustments] is in such a state of turmoil thatMMS should probably refrain from addressing this issue at this time.''Another commenter stated, ``The royalty to be paid for coal depends onthe actual date of coal severance (date of being mined) * * *.'' One commenternoted that the 30-day requirement of paragraph (d) could be in conflictwith certain lease terms and MMS should ensure that the ``proposition (`leaseterms govern') should be constant throughout the rules.'' One commenter``suggested that the lessee should at least be given some `force majeure'relief on the 30-day requirement if he is unable to rotate his stockpiledue to forces beyond the lessee's control.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>There is no confusion in the area of lease readjustment.The policy of the Department of the Interior is to readjust all Federalcoal leases to be consistent with the requirements of 30 U.S.C. 207, asimplemented by appropriate regulations of 43 CFR Subpart 3451. This policyhas been upheld by the courts (citations provided earlier). The purposeof this regulation is to provide the lessee formal written policy regardingthe imposition of new ad valorem royalty rates on previously mined coalinventories, which were in existence on the effective date of the leasereadjustment.The language of andSection; 206.256 as published in the July 15, 1988, noticewas carried forward into this final rulemaking.Section 206.257 Valuation standards for ad valorem leasesThe final rulemaking adopts the basic valuation approach as it was proposedin the July 15, 1988, notice. However, several changes have been made toconform with the amended definition of gross proceeds and to adopt theCommission on Fair Market Value Policy for Federal Coal Leasing recommendationthat State and local severance taxes be excluded from gross proceeds. Otherminor changes, which are described below, were made for clarity.Following the original January 15, 1987, proposed rulemaking, MMS receivedseveral editorial-type comments concerning paragraph (a) which were suggestedfor clarification. Some comments repeated earlier statements that a processingallowance should be used in place of a washing allowance. The MMS clarifiedparagraph (a) in the July 15, 1988, notice by revising the language andadding the deductibility of an allowance for beneficiation pursuant toandSection; 206.265. No additional comments were received specific to thisparagraph. Therefore, this paragraph has no changes from the July 15, 1988,notice.Paragraph (b)(1) contains no changes from the July 15, 1988, notice. Thisparagraph essentially continues the existing policy of determining percentum coal royalties on the basis of sales prices obtained pursuant toarm's-length contracts. Acceptance of the sanctity of such contracts remainsa fundamental valuation concept. It represents very important ideas aboutthe nature of business in the free marketplace. That is, that businesseshave the right, within the bounds of what is legal, to fix a relationshipby a binding written agreement. The freedom to write contracts and to abideby their terms represents a fundamental trait of this Nation's economicsystem. These rules and specfically this paragraph adhere to this featureof the U.S. economic system, because this paragraph states that the lessoragrees to limit its share of royalties to a specified fraction of receiptsreceived by the lessee. In other words, MMS accepts as a proper valuationfor the payment of royalties the value negotiated at arm's-length witha purchaser in light of the marketing conditions that existed at the timethe contract was entered.The MMS received several comments suggesting alternative methodologiesfor valuation. Earlier in this preamble MMS responded to a proposal tovalue on the basis of heat content. Other commenters suggested establishing``fair market value'' through techniques other than by contract sale prices.The MMS rejects all of these alternatives. The MMS maintains that thereis nothing wrong with the workings of the competitive marketplace. Accordingly,the marketplace will continue to be the primary determinant of value ofcoal for royalty purposes.<T3>Comment:</T3> Paragraph (b)(2) conditions MMS acceptance of gross proceedsunder contracts on whether each contract reflects the total considerationactually transferred from buyer to seller. A number of industry commentsobjected to this provision and stated that MMS should restrict the valuebasis to the contract sales price.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> MMS recognizes that there must be exceptions tothe general rule that the lessee's arm's-length contract price should beaccepted without question as the value for royalty purposes.For example, if a lessee sells coal to the neighboring nonaffiliated utilityat reduced prices and in return the utility sells electricity to the lesseeat a reduced rate, then the coal sale agreement would not be reflectiveof the full value of coal.In the event that MMS becomes aware of consideration that exists outsidethe four corners of the contract, MMS could accept the lessee's gross proceedsas value, adjusted to reflect the additional consideration when that additionalconsideration can be converted to a dollar value. However, in some circumstancesthe additional consideration may not be easily calculable. Thus, even ifthe parties are not affiliated and the contract is ``arm's-length,'' MMSmay require under paragraph (b)(2) that the coal production be valued inaccordance with paragraph (c), the standards used to value coal disposedof under non-arm's-length contracts. Under these standards, the lessee'sgross proceeds still may determine value, but the lessee will be requiredto demonstrate comparability to other arm's-length contracts. Thus, despiteseveral industry comments suggesting that this section be deleted, it isretained in the final rules.Paragraph (b)(2) is not meant to apply to situations where there is intentionalmisconduct by the lessee. Such circumstances are covered by paragraph (b)(3).Rather, it could be used in situations where a lessee did not considera particular benefit provided by its purchaser to be a payment for coal,but MMS on review considers it to be part of the consideration for coalproduction under the contract.<T3>Comment:</T3> Many comments were received concerning paragraph (b)(3)following the July 15, 1988, notice. Many industry comments asserted thatMMS was attempting to expand its rule beyond the traditional bounds ofa lessor, as intended by Congress. One comment stated ``MMS is bringingthe negligence concept from tort law to a contractual relationship.'' Manycomments stated that this regulation would effectively grant MMS licenseto second guess the lessee's legal and business judgment. Other commentsstated that paragraph (b)(3) created undue uncertainties in the royaltyvaluation process and would result in an expansion of litigation.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>Even if the contract is between unaffiliated personsand thus ``arm's-length,'' pursuant to andSection; 206.251, if MMS determinesthat the gross proceeds do not reflect the reasonable value of the productionbecause of misconduct by the contracting parties or because the lesseeotherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market the productionfor the mutual benefit of the lessee and lessor, then MMS may require thatthe coal be valued pursuant to the first applicable criterion of paragraph(c)(2).Thus, MMS first must determine that a price is unreasonable; for example,by looking at comparable contracts and sales. Then MMS must determine thatthe unreasonably low price was the result of misconduct or a breach bythe lessee of its duty to market the production for the mutual benefitof itself and the lessor.A breach of the lessee's duty to market production for the mutual benefitof the lessee includes, but is not limited to, collusion between the producer/sellerand buyer, pricing practices found by a court or regulatory authority tobe incorrect or fraudulently manipulated, or negligence in negotiatingcontracts.When MMS makes the determination under paragraph (b)(3), the effect isthat the arm's-length contract price will not be accepted automatically.Instead, value will be independently determined using the benchmarks inparagraph (c).<T3>Comment:</T3> Paragraph (b)(5) excludes the cost of the Black Lungexcise tax, the AML fee, and severance tax from gross proceeds to arriveat the value for Federal royalty purposes. These specific exclusions donot apply to Indian leases. In the preamble to the July 15, 1988, notice,MMS provided an extensive accounting of comments that had been receivedprior to that date. In the July 15, 1988, preamble, MMS requested additionalcomments on whether the Black Lung excise tax and AML fee should be excludedfrom the value basis. The MMS requested further comment on whether theconcept of excluding certain costs should be extended to include exemptionfor the costs of State severance taxes and ``royalty on royalty.'' ``Royaltyon royalty'' or ``royalty on itself'' is a phrase used by commenters todescribe the royalty effects of a lessee raising the sales price to recapturethe cost of the royalty itself.The overwhelming majority of industry commenters advocated excluding allFederal and State imposed taxes, fees, and royalties. Most of these commentersstated that the taxes and fees did not add to the value of the coal andtherefore should not be subject to royalty. One western coal producingState commenter agreed with the industry consensus. Four western coal producingStates recommended rejecting the policy of excluding the Black Lung excisetax and the AML fee from the royalty value. Four western coal producingStates also recommended rejecting the policy of excluding State severancetaxes from the value basis. Three western coal producing States recommendedrejecting the policy of excluding the cost of royalty (``royalty on royalty'')from the value basis. One commenter stated: ``MMS' algebraic manipulationsin the preamble notwithstanding, this proposal boils down to nothing moreand nothing less than reducing the 12.5% royalty rate to 11.39%.'' Onewestern coal producing State chose not to comment on any of these possibleexclusions but instead requested an alternative valuation system for lowBtu content coal. Several coal consuming States advocated adoption of thealternative valuation proposal that was submitted jointly by representativesof the coal and electric utility industries. That proposal would excludeall production taxes, fees, and royalties.Several industry commenters stated that the proposed exclusions shouldextend to Indian coal also. The Indian commenters, on the other hand, expressedagreement with the proposed regulatory provision to exempt Indian coalfrom any of the exclusions for taxes, fees, and royalties. One Federalagency stated that excluding the Black Lung excise tax and the AML feefrom Indian lands ``could precipitate an adverse situation, wherein producerswould preferentially develop non-Indian lands. This does not seem consistentwith the trust responsibility of the Federal Government with regard toIndian mineral resources.''The MMS received numerous comments on the deletion of reimbursements forBlack Lung Excise Taxes and Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Fees (AML)from royalty value. Thirty-nine respondents, consisting of industry representatives,one local government association, and one State, specifically supportedMMS's proposed deletion of reimbursements for Black Lung Excise Taxes andAbandoned Mine Land Reclamation Fees from royalty value. One industry respondentexplained: ``The exclusion of Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (AML) feesand Black Lung (BL) taxes is appropriate as they add no enhancement tothe real value of the coal.'' Another industry commenter noted supportfor ``Secretary Hodel's proposal to exclude those reimbursables [FederalBlack Lung Taxes and Abandoned Mine Land Fees] from gross proceeds on thegrounds that it is inequitable to require lessees to pay royalties on leviesimposed by Federal, State, or local governments solely to mine coal.''Many other respondents repeated this rationale. One industry respondentoffered a somewhat different reasoning by stating that it was appropriatefor MMS to take action to ``enhance the competitiveness of Federal andTribal coal, and hence the viability of the domestic coal industry.''Eighteen respondents, consisting of 14 State organizations and 4 Indiangroups, opposed the exclusion of any reimbursed taxes or fees from grossproceeds. Most respondents maintained that MMS's explanation of why BlackLung Excise Taxes and AML fees are excluded from gross proceeds was notsufficient or acceptable. One Indian respondent specifically commentedthat MMS's justification for exclusion was not true with respect to Indianswho do not set the rate of either the Black Lung Excise Tax or the AMLfee. The respondent further noted that AML fees have not been made availableto Indian lands. A State respondent commented: ``These fees are essentiallya pass-through, the lessee does receive the benefit of the purchaser reimbursinghim * * *.'' These costs would otherwise be borne by the lessee. AnotherState respondent claimed: ``The MMS proposal would have the effect of reducingroyalties on coal without going through the findings required under theMinerals Leasing Act, 30 U.S.C. 209.'' One other State respondent concurredwith this statement. Several other State respondents objected to the exclusionof Black Lung Excise Taxes and AML fees on the grounds that it sets a precedentand ``opens the door for the exclusion of other items * * *.''The MMS also received comments stating that the value of coal should bereduced by amounts for State and local severance taxes. Most comments maintainedthat the resulting lower royalty costs would promote development and lowercosts to consumers. Other comments stated that severance taxes should beexcluded from the value basis because the lessee merely collects thesetaxes on behalf of the taxing authority. Hence, the lessee obtains no benefitor value from the collection of such pass-through taxes. As one commentexplained, ``None of these cost [tax] components are part of the `value'of the raw product, coal, to the lessee. The lessee receives nothing inreturn for these payments; i.e., they are true liabilities and to chargea royalty on them is unconscionable.'' Several commenters pointed out theMMS's proposed rules are not in accord with the February 1984 recommendationof the President's Commission on fair market value policy for Federal CoalLeasing (Linowes Commission). One commenter restated the conclusions ofLinowes Commission by stating ``[T]he Federal royalty should be based onthe value of the coal being produced, not on State and local taxes as well.Federal royalty policies should not create an incentive for higher Stateand local severance taxes, or similar production based taxes, by increasingthe effective total return to a given percentage tax. State and local governmentsshould bear the direct responsibility for the full financial impact oftheir severance taxes. Accordingly, the Commission recommended that `thebase for calculating Federal royalty payments should be the F.O.B. priceminus all State and local severance and similar taxes'.''A definition of severance tax has been added in andSection; 206.251. <T3>See</T3> discussion above.During the September 7, 1988, public hearing, a difference of opinion surfacedconcerning whether exclusions for taxes, fees, or royalties, representsan established industry standard outside of Federal coal leasing. One industrycommenter stated unequivocally that all private coal leases in the westcontained valuation terms that were net (noninclusive) of taxes, fees,and royalties. The other industry commenter refuted the previous commenter'sposition by stating that it was not that conclusive. The commenter statedthat lease terms often varied by region and often the bargaining strengthsof the parties dictated the ultimate lease valuation provisions. This commenterthen concluded that his company's leases and other large landholder's leasescontained lease terms requiring royalty to be assessed at the gross (noexclusion) level. <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS has adopted the provision that amounts forAML fees and Black Lung taxes are excluded from royalty value. The MMSagrees that these fees do not add to the value of the coal. On review,MMS declined to extend the exclusions from royalty value to include ``royaltyon royalty.'' The term ``royalty on royalty'' is somewhat a misnomer. Althoughvarious mathematical calculations were submitted to show the effects ofpurchaser royalty reimbursement on royalty payments, no argument couldchange the nature of what a mineral royalty is: A share of minerals produced.At a rate of 12.5 percent, one ton out of eight belongs to the lessor,no more and no less. To attribute some intangible addition to the lessor'sshare destroys the concept of royalty itself. Therefore, the proposal toexclude ``royalty on royalty'' was not adopted in the final rule. Paragraph (b)(5) also has been modified to allow for the exclusion of Stateand local severance taxes from gross proceeds. Additional language wasadded to clarify that these exclusions refer only to the cost of the taxor fee itself. No additional deduction is allowed because the lessee hasincurred interest charges or other monetary penalties arising from thenonpayment or underpayment of the Black Lung excise tax, AML fee, or severancetax. The Department believes that there are several reasons to exclude severancetaxes from the Federal royalty value for coal. First, coal has its ownvaluation history. Second, but related, are the characteristics of thecoal marketplace. The comment submitted jointly by the National Coal Association, AmericanMining Congress, Edison Electric Institute and the Western Coal TrafficLeague, and the comment submitted on behalf of Kanawha and Hocking Coalandamp; Coke Company and Valley Camp of Utah, Inc., focused on the historicalvaluation of coal. First, as noted earlier, prior to the Federal Coal LeasingAmendments Act of 1976 (FCLAA) revision to the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA),virtually all Federal coal leases had cents-per-ton royalty clauses. Therefore,severance taxes as part of royalty value was not an issue. The first administrativedecision dealing with the coal severance tax issue is <T3>Knife River Coal Co., </T3>29 IBLA [Interior Board of Land Appeals]26 (1977), a decision involving one of the few pre-FCLAA leases with anad valorem royalty clause. The Board concluded that it should follow thedecisions involving gas and include severance tax reimbursements as partof the value. However, in deciding that case, IBLA did not address twoimportant concepts. First, the MLA as amended by FCLAA was different forcoal than for gas in terms of defining the royalty obligation. For gas,royalty is due on the ``value of the production,'' 30 U.S.C. 226, whereasfor coal, royalty is due on ``the value of coal as defined by regulation* * * .'' Second, IBLA did not consider that when the Department adoptedregulations to implement the new statutory scheme as for gas. The currentcoal regulations in 30 CFR 203.200(f) use the term ``gross value'' whereasthe oil and gas rules in 30 CFR Part 206 always used the term gross proceeds.Also, the department did adopt specific rules providing that tax reimbursementsare included in gross proceeds. <T3>See </T3>Notice to Lessees and Operators of Federal and Indian OnshoreOil and Gas Leases (NTL-5), 42 FR 22610 (May 4, 1977)). Such a specificrequirement was not promulgated for coal. More important than the historical application of regulatory provisionsby the Department, however, is the perception today by both coal producersand coal purchasers of the market for coal. As MMS has consistently emphasizedin its product value rulemaking, the best determinant of value is the market.In the coal context, some of the comments maintain that severance taxesare not part of the market value of the coal. For example, in its comments,the Western Fuels Association reiterated testimony that it had previouslyprovided to the Congress:<ITAG tagnum="21">The value of a product does not increase because a tax or fee is addedto it, only its cost increases. As a matter of fact, the inclusion of theseitems could well cause the product's value to decline.</ITAG>The Western Fuels Association, as well as many other commenters, also citedthe Linowes Commission, <T3>Report of the Commission: Fair Market Value Policy for Federal CoalLeasing.</T3> Recommendation VIII-5 of that report states: ``The base forcalculating Federal royalty payments should be the F.O.B. price minus allState and local severance taxes and similar taxes.'' Thus, this independentcommission did not consider taxes to be part of value.A comment which focused directly on the question of how the market perceivesseverance taxes was submitted by Utah Power andamp; Light Co. It's commentstates:<ITAG tagnum="21">The MMS has stated that the cornerstone of the regulations is theinteraction of buyers and sellers who are knowledgeable, willing and notobligated to buy or sell. This market concept does not properly considerfederal and state taxes and/or fees which are not set in the market place,but arbitrarily set by federal and state agencies for purposes of raisingrevenues. The states and Federal Government as lessor can manipulate its'[sic] royalty revenue by increasing or decreasing taxes and fees, provingthey do not contribute to the value of coal. This not only puts a burdenof uncertainty on producers and consumers of federal coal but providesthe lessor a mechanism to impact the ``\1/8\ share'' of production he isto receive. Additionally, the inclusion of these fees, which are not marketdriven, unnecessarily inflate the cost of federal coal in the long-run,potentially making it an undersirable fuel choice. </ITAG>Utah Power andamp; Light's comments were addressing only AML fees, BlackLung taxes, State severance taxes and Federal royalty_not State or Federalincome taxes and similar taxes.The characteristics of the market for coal also was the subject of considerablecomment by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI). It is EEI's conclusionthat ``Coal is not a commodity like oil. The market for Western coal isuser specific and is custom-produced according to quantity and quality.''The EEI also noted: ``In fact, seldom is the same price paid for Westerncoal from the same mine where the mine sells coal to several buyers.''It is indeed true that oil and gas and coal are very different commodities.In addition to their obvious physical differences and the differences inproduction methods, Federal western coal is used in large part only forelectric generation, whereas this is only one of many uses for oil andgas. Related to their varied uses is the fact that oil and gas prices aredictated in large part by international market forces. Coal, on the otherhand, is affected more by specific markets because it is not a fungible.For example, many large western mines are developed to supply coal to aparticular powerplant which is designed specifically to burn that coal.If that purchaser is lost, the coal may not be readily saleable. The differences in the coal market from that for oil and gas have resultedin different contracting practices, with the value of the coal being establishedfirst, and then severance taxes and other reimbursables being treated separately.Again, what purchasers are willing to pay for domestic oil and gas tendsto be dictated more by international market forces than by local marketneeds.It is the Department's conclusion from the large number of comments itreceived that consideration of the interaction of the market place supportsexcluding severance taxes from the value of the coal for royalty purposes.As noted above, coal buyers, and sellers commented that taxes are not partof the coal's value. Many of the comments point that even the states whichimpose a severance tax recognize that there is a determinable value forthe coal before the tax is assessed because the assessment is based onthe value of the coal net of any amount representing the tax. Thus, forcoal, the Department has concluded that severance taxes increase the costof the resource but not its value. Consequently, the Department is excludingseverance taxes from the value of coal for Federal royalty purposes.<T3>Comment:</T3> Paragraph (b) (6) of the proposed rule provided thatthe royalty value would not include payments received by a lessee pursuantto its contract if the lessee demonstrates to MMS's satisfaction, thatsuch payments were not part of the total consideration paid for the purchaseof coal. Most comments received by MMS were addressed earlier in the general commentresponse to MMS's position with respect to take-or-pay and similar typepayments. However, one comment raissed particular issues that require separateresponses here. The commenter stated that the proposed regulation, as worded,appears to defeat judicial review because the demonstration (that a paymentis not royalty bearing) is ``to MMS's satisfaction,'' instead of an objectivefinding of fact. The commenter concluded that ``Royalty determinationsare subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act asactions that have not been committed to agency discretion by law, and MMScannot adopt an unreviewable standard in the face of this congressionalmandate for review.''<T3>MMS Response:</T3> There is no attempt to circumvent the requirementsof The Administrative Procedure Act. The MMS decisions generally are subjectto the administrative appeal process. Adverse decisions may ultimatelybe taken to the Federal court system for relief.The MMS has adopted this paragraph (b)(b) as proposed. Under this section,there is a presumption that payments received by the lessee from its purchaserare payments for coal production. The lessee can rebut that presumption,but the burden is on the lessee to come forward with the justificationfor its position that the payment was not for coal production. The MMSalways has had a consistent policy that royalty is due on no less thanthe lessee's gross proceeds, which includes all payments for production.Heretofore, that policy resulted in royalty demands on virtually all paymentsfrom the purchaser to the seller. However, payments must indeed be paymentsfor coal production before any royalty is owed. Therefore, lessees willhave the opportunity to come forward with arguments as to why a particularpayment under a coal sales contract is not part of the value of the coalproduction.Because there are so many different types of coal sales contract clauses,MMS cannot include in this rulemaking comprehensive criteria which couldbe considered in deciding whether a lessee has met its burden to demonstratea particular payment is not royalty bearing. However, MMS will certainlyconsider such factors as the terms of the sales contract, the lessee'srationale for its claim that the payment is not part of the value of production,how the purchaser characterizes the transaction (particularly if it isa public utility subject to state public utilities commission regulation),and any other relevant matters. Other factors could include the following:1. The unit sale or contract price, including prices that explicitly varywith the level of production, are considered royalty bearing.2. Payments not designated as part of the purchase price, but made on aperiodic or regularly scheduled basis, generally are royalty bearing.3. ``Settlement'' payments made to terminate a sales contract before thecontractually-specified termination date will usually not be consideredpayment for produced coal. If there is a follow-on contract, MMS will reviewthe circumstances to determine if some or all of the payment is royaltybearing.4. Payments or reimbursements for services or processing costs customarilythe responsibility of the lessee, including that required to put the productin marketable condition, will usually be considered payment for producedcoal.5. Damages recovered under a court judgment, or included in a liquidateddamages clause, that are for the purchaser's breach of a sales contractare usually not considered payment for produced coal, if they correspondto or are a reasonable estimate of the producer's lost profit.The provisions of paragraph (b)(6) will not be applicable to any typesof payments which other sections of the rules expressly include as partof the royalty value, such as payments for the costs of placing productionin marketable condition.As MMS gains experience in dealing with these issues, MMS expects to developcriteria which may be included in the regulations at a later date.Paragraph (c), which contains MMS's valuation criteria when coal is disposedof under non-arm's length conditions, generally is unchanged from the July15, 1988, notice. The MMS did make one change to clarify the applicationof the first benchmark in paragraph (c)(2). The proposed rule providedthat MMS would accept the lessee's gross proceeds under its non-arm's-lengthcontract if those proceeds were ``equivalent'' to those under ``comparable''arm's-length contracts. While the proposal included criteria for comparability,no criteria existed for equivalency; therefore, MMS has modified the finalrule to provide that the lessee's non-arm's-length gross proceeds willbe acceptable if it is within the ``range'' of gross proceeds paid undercomparable arm's-length contracts in the field or area.<T3>Comment: </T3>The MMS received numerous comments following the January15, 1987, proposed rulemaking concerning non-arm's-length valuation. Eightindustry, three Indian, and three State respondents submitted 27 commentsregarding the non-arm's-length valuation criteria of the regulations. Oneindustry commenter stated MMS should always be notified which valuationcriteria is being used. One industry commenter questioned what is a ``reasonablevalue[?]'' One industry commenter stated that the value of non-arm's-lengthsales should always be established using that lessee's arm's-length contracts.The respondent supported its position by stating, ``The lessee's arm's-lengthcontracts are the best evidence of the value'' had the lessee ``sold thecoal under an arm's-length contract.'' One industry commenter suggestedusing the average price of the lessee's arm's-length contracts. One industryrespondent stated that paragraph (c) could be deleted if ``the criteriafor determining gross royalty [were adopted] as prescribed in 26 CFR 1.6134(b)(2),based on a representative market or field price.''Fourteen comments recommended either revising the application order orrevising the language of the valuation criteria. Two State commenters recommendedexchanging the sequence of paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii). Two Indiancommenters recommended ignoring arm's-length contracts of the lessee andseeking ``[t]he highest gross proceeds'' in ``the same coal field'' oralternatively ``from other coal fields'' as being the first two preferredvaluation criteria. One State commenter suggested revising paragraph (c)(2)(ii)because it would be too difficult to implement, and the contracts of otherlessees would not be available. Another industry commenter stated thatthe term ``area'' as used in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) should be defined. Twoindustry and one State respondent specifically addressed paragraph (c)(2)(iii),which would use prices reported to a public utility commission as the valuefor royalty purposes. One State commenter suggested this method was themost accurate because ``it is highly unlikely that they [utilities] willunderstate their coal or fuel costs.'' One industry commenter stated thatthe value should be the production costs reported to the public utilitycommission less taxes and fees but plus a profit. One industry commenterdisagreed with the use of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) because the regulationis unclear as to ``who is reporting the price of the coal,'' and the pricecould include transportation and handling expenses, thus unnecessarilyincreasing the royalty value of the coal.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The intent of sequenced valuation criteria is toavoid any opportunity to selectively choose a valuation method which minimizesthe lessee's royalty obligation, as opposed to correctly establishing royaltyvalue under these rules. Conversely, these rules also offer the lesseethe assurance that MMS would not arbitrarily rebut the benchmark that assignsthe highest gross proceeds in the area to the lessee unless mandated bythe regulatory criteria.The July 15, 1988, notice contained minor modifications to the non-arm's-lengthvaluation criteria listed in paragraph (c) of the January 15, 1987, proposedrulemaking. Most notable was that criteria (i) and (ii) were combined intoa single valuation criterion. The effect from this modification is to increasethe number of arm's-length contracts available for review, thus increasingthe opportunity for a value via comparable arm's-length contracts. Also,as discussed above, MMS has replaced the term ``equivalent'' with provisionsthat clarify MMS's intent that the non-arm's-length price would be acceptableif it is within the range of comparable arm's-length contracts in the fieldor area. The MMS also removed the term ``reasonable'' from the phrase ``reasonablevalue,'' which was stated in the first two sentences of paragraph (c)(2).Any value correctly established under paragraph (b) or (c) is the valuefor royalty purposes.With respect to the comment requesting adoption of 26 CFR 1.613-4(b)(2),MMS cannot identify any benefits in administration or simplification invaluation that would occur. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rejectsthe taxpayer's use of representative market or field prices determinedby exceptional, insignificant, unusual, tie-in, or accommodation sales.The IRS also disregards any representative market or field price establishedin transactions between members of a controlled group unless the IRS hasdetermined the price to be a competitive sale price. See 26 CFR 1.613-4(c)(3).The IRS requires any taxpayer that computes its depletable income usingrepresentative market or field prices to attach to its tax return a summarystatement indicating the price or prices used and the sources of the informationas to such price or prices. Also, IRS requires the relevant supportingdata to be assembled, segregated, and made readily available at the taxpayer'sprincipal place of business (26 CFR 1.614-4(c)(5)). The MMS considers theIRS provisions more burdensome than the provisions in these rules. <T3>Comment:</T3> One State respondent objected to using spot market pricesto value coal under paragraph (c)(2)(v), explaining that ``our experiencewith published or publically [sic] available spot market prices for fuelsleaves much to be desired.'' Three commenters disagreed with the mandatoryprioritization of the non-arm's-length valuation criteria. One State commentedthat such a prioritized approach could ``be more appropriately referredto as a straight jacket system.'' Another State commented that ``prioritizingthe benchmarks constitutes a significant change in long-standing * * *procedures'' and would ``limit the Secretary's discretionary ability ** *.'' One Indian commenter maintained that the lessee should not selectthe appropriate valuation criterion, but instead MMS should apply the correctvaluation method. One Indian commenter stated the non-arm's-length valuation criteria aretoo subjective and costly to administer. One Indian commenter stated thatif the approach of paragraph (c) were to be used (to determine value inaccordance with this paragraph), then ``[t]he Secretary should determinewhether each contract is arm's-length or non-arm's-length * * *.'' One industry commenter stated that the net-back approach of paragraph (c)(2)(vi)was ill-defined. <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS will review the procedures adopted by lesseesto establish non-arm's-length royalty values on a selective basis. TheMMS intends to ensure compliance with these rules through vigorous monitoring,review, and audit activity. The MMS will verify that lessees chose thecorrect valuation method and will be available to assist lessees in calculatingnet-back royalty values. The MMS agrees that the prioritized valuationcriteria procedure is a departure from past practice. The benchmark systemhas been adopted in order to provide certainty in valuing coal for royaltypurposes. The MMS wishes to point out that MMS discretion is not attenuatedin making a decision on whether or not a contract is arm's-length. If alessee incorrectly maintains that a contract is arm's-length and pays royaltyaccordingly, the MMS may find otherwise and require royalties be paid accordingto non-arm's-length criteria. <T3>Comment:</T3> In the July 15, 1988 notice, the coal industry had commentedthat in today's weak coal market MMS should not receive a royalty computedon a cost-based contract that exists between affiliates. These commentswere based on the premise that in today's environment mining costs oftenexceed the price for which coal can be sold in the marketplace. Therefore,MMS specifically requested comments on whether the final rules should includea provision whereby royalty value for non-arm's-length sales in mine mouthor captive mine situations should be based principally on current marketdeterminants such as spot prices. Several comments were received responding to this specific request. Themajority of commenters supported the non-arm's-length valuation procedureas proposed by MMS; i.e., the first applicable benchmark but in no caseless than gross proceeds. One commenter stated, ``The prices in such [non-arm's-length]contracts nonetheless represent the value of coal to the purchaser, atleast to the extent that such contract prices are accepted and passed onto consumers by the appropriate electric utility regulatory body, and theyare gross proceeds to the producer. It would be grossly unfair to allowproducers to pay a royalty only on the current spot market price of coalwhen they receive, and electricity consumers pay, far more for the coal.'' Another commenter noted that accurate spot market prices are generallyunavailable, and, although they are an indication of current market prices,they have no application when compared to long-term captive mine agreements.Only one commenter agreed that the value of coal should be based solelyon market value determinants such as spot market prices. In a somewhatdifferent approach, another commenter stated that value for captive minescould be determined by biennial regional rulemaking. In this approach MMSwould in some way average current spot and term bids with the average contractprice paid during the previous year. In regard to Indian coal, one commentstated, ``We recommend that for Indian coal leases, MMS take the higherof the results between the current market determinants and the value asdetermined by benchmarks. Such dual accounting for Indian leases is consistentwith the Secretary's trust responsibility.'' One other comment was receivedin regard to the the non-arm's-length benchmarks at andSection; 206.257(c)(2).This comment expressed concern that in a rising market, using a comparativearm's-length value would remove some of the benefits of a long-term arrangementwith their subsidiary. This same commenter also cautioned that prices reportedto public utility commissions or prices reported to the Energy InformationAdministration may contain plant handling or transportation costs thatshould not be subject to royalty.  Another commenter applauded MMS's use of the net-back method as the benchmarkof last resort.  <T3>MMS Reponse.</T3> The MMS has decided not to disturb the arm's-lengthvaluation criteria as listed in the July 15, 1988, notice. Therefore, thefirst criteria to be applied are market-based value determinants. The lesseewould be required to compare its non-arm's-length contract with its comparablearm's-length contracts and to other comparable arm's-length contracts ofcoal producers in the same area. Using the comparability criteria in paragraph(c)(2) will ensure that long-term contracts are compared only to otherlong-term contracts and not to spot contracts. Likewise, in valuing a lessee'sspot sales contract, only other spot sales contracts will be used.  Failing to establish a value using the arm's-length comparability test,the lessee would then establish the coal's value using the prices approvedby a State public utility commission or, following that, prices reportedto the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy. Settingthe coal's value for royalty purposes based on prices approved by publicutility commissions is consistent with MMS's gross proceeds concept, becausethe amount that a utility can pay for its own captive coal production isregulated and approved by the public utility commission. Therefore, inthis situation, MMS is limiting its royalty value to that value receivedby the lessee.  As restated in 1984 by the Supreme Court of the State of New Mexico ina case involving the reasonableness of coal costs: <ITAG tagnum="21">The normal burden to be met in making a <T3>prima facie</T3> case regarding costs incurred in transactions withnon-affiliates is a demonstration that the costs were, in fact, incurred.However, the normal burden regarding costs incurred in transactions withaffiliates is heavier, requiring a showing of the reasonableness of thecosts. <T3>Boise Water Corp.</T3> v. <T3>Idaho Public Utilities Commission</T3>, 97 Idaho 832, 555 P.2d 163(1976). </ITAG>If the public utility commission is unconvinced of the justness or reasonablenessof a utility's costs, including fuel (coal) costs, it can deny incorporationof those costs into the electric rates.  The MMS ranked the use of spot market prices low for minimal applicationbecause of dissimilarities between long-term contracts and spot marketsales in market purpose and motivation and because of disparities in long-termversus spot sales market share.  Literature published on the domestic coal market states that the domesticcoal market is subdivided into two categories: The commercial coal marketand the captive coal market.    The commercial coal market is comprised of coal producers that do not usetheir product and coal consumers that do not produce it. Within this subdivisiontwo types of transactions dominate, which are the long-term contract andspot sales. The purposes of long-term coal contracts have been stated tobe: <ITAG tagnum="16">_Assured quantity (buyer expectation) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_Assured quality (buyer expectation) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_Predictable price (buyer expectation) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_Assured demand (seller expectation) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_Minimized investment risk (seller expectation) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_Guaranteed cashflow (seller expectation) </ITAG>Only some of the previously listed advantages of security and stability,for the buyer or the seller, are present in the spot market. Because boththe supply and demand for spot market coal tends to be short term, thepricing of spot market coal is substantially more volatile than that oflong-term contracts. The volatility of the spot market, for both the coal consumer and coalproducer, coupled with the huge investments required to open a westernsurface mine, relegates the spot sales to a small fraction of the totalmarket. The Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, publicationtitled <T3>Coal Data: A Reference </T3>(released March 6, 1987), shows the followinghistorical average relationship between market share of long-term contractsand spot sales. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp0,s10,9,9,9</C> <H1>Year</H1><H1>Long-term contract (million short tons)</H1><H1>Spot sales million short tons</H1><H1>Spot sales tonnage as a percent of total tonnage \1\</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1981<D>500.9</D><D>75.5</D><D>13.10 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1982<D>540.6</D><D>57.0</D><D>9.54 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1983<D>523.6</D><D>69.2</D><D>11.67 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1984<D>584.8</D><D>99.3</D><D>14.52 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1985<D>592.4</D><D>74.3</D><D>11.14 </D><F>\1\ Total tonnage equals long-term contract tonnage plus spot salestonnage.</F></ITAG></ITAG> The Wyoming Geological Survey publication titled <T3>Wyoming Geo-notes No. 14</T3> (published April 1987) stated that in1985 spot sales accounted for about 4 percent of total Wyoming coal sales.In 1986 spot sales accounted for about 5 percent of total Wyoming coalsales. The second major subdivision of the domestic coal market is the captivecoal market, wherein the consumers produce their own coal to satisfy theirneeds. In contrast to the commercial market, captive coal producers donot normally sell captive coal production on the spot market. Instead,captive coal's principal use is to serve internal consumption requirements.<T3>Comment</T3>: Prior to publication of the July 15, 1988, notice, severalcomments were made on andSection; 206.259(d), now designated andSection; 206.257(d).Three industry and two Indian respondents submitted four comments concerningparagraph (d). Three industry commenters suggested amending this paragraphto provide for lessee appeals of MMS valuation determinations. Both commentsproposed adding a new section of regulation, with one commenter stating``to provide for an adjudicatory hearing on MMS determinations under 5U.S.C. 544 [sic].'' One Indian commenter recommended ``in the case of Indianlands, all non-arm's-length computations of value for royalty purposes* * * should be preapproved [by MMS].'' Another Indian commenter agreed,and also stated paragraph (d) ``should require MMS to notify the tribeor allottee involved of any change in value determinations.'' <T3>MMS Response</T3>: The right of a lessee to appeal MMS decisions isprovided at 30 CFR Part 290. Further right of appeal is provided at 43CFR Part 4, ``Department Hearings and Appeals Procedures.'' The MMS considersthat the current appeal procedures provide appropriate avenues of recourseto the lessee. With regard to the comment of Tribal or allottee notificationof value determinations, the MMS finds it reasonable that Tribes or allotteesshould be provided an explanation when MMS product value determinationsaffect royalties. For the July 15, 1988, notice, paragraph (d) was modified from the firstproposal. Paragraph (d)(1) provides that value determinations under paragraph(c) do not require MMS's prior approval. However, the lessee would be requiredto retain all data that would be subject to review and audit. The MMS coulddirect a lessee to use a different value for calculating royalty if itdetermines that the lessee's reported value is inconsistent with the requirementsof the regulations.Paragraph (d)(2) requires a lessee to make sales and sales quantity dataavailable to authorized MMS, State, and Indian representatives, to theInspector General of the Department of the Interior, and to other authorizedpersons. Paragraph (d)(3) continues to provide a notification requirement if a lesseedetermined value using the second through fifth benchmarks. Paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) are adopted unchanged in this finalrulemaking.  <T3>Comment: </T3>Paragraph (e) was added in the July 15, 1988, noticeto clarify that if a lessee improperly determines value, the lessee wouldbe liable for both the additional royalties and interest. A few commentersnoted that interest is not actually a penalty, and that penalties shouldbe charged in addition to interest. Comments were also received on theissue of interest after the January 15, 1987, proposed rulemaking. Severalcommenters stated MMS should pay interest to lessees for royalty overpayments.One commenter explained, ``For the sake of consistency and fundamentalfairness, the interest payment should either apply in both cases or inneither.'' One commenter took a different approach, arguing that if ``theUnited States cannot provide or pay interest on judgments without the expressconsent or approval of the Congress, it does not seem to preclude the government'srecognition of such over-payment, along with the interest accrued, throughmeans of an escrow account system with payment of the interest going tothe prevailing party.'' this same commenter provided an alternative recommendation``to allow credits on royalties due in the future, including the interestearned on the original over-payment of royalty.'' One commenter recommendedrevising current paragraph (e) to ``provide for some allowance for errorfor which no interest will be assessed on the underpayment, similar tothe Internal Revenue Service's allowance for the payment of estimated taxwhich will be due.''  <T3>MMS Response: </T3>MMS believes that the interest payment requiredfor improperly reporting value, while not a penalty, is a sufficient deterrentto intentional underreporting. In addition, under the provisions of 18U.S.C. 1001, it is a crime punishable by up to 5 years imprisonment ora fine of $10,000, or both, for anyone knowingly and willfully to submitor cause to be submitted to any Agency of the United States any false orfraudulent statement(s) to any matters within the Agency's jurisdiction.On the issue of MMS paying interest to lessees for royalty overpayments,Congress has not provided MMS with this option, and MMS cannot authorizewhich interest payments, without Congress' approval. The MMS also doesnot have authority to establish escrow accounts.<T3>Comment: </T3>Twenty industry and one Indian respondent commented onandSection;206.257(g), which primarily would require that the value for royaltypurposes can be no less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lesseeless applicable exclusions. Paragraph (g) was initially proposed as andSection;206.259(f).Comments pertaining to the ``which could accrue'' issue have been addressedby MMS at andSection;206.257(b). Other comments were received concerningtake-or-pay payments. The <T3>MMS </T3>addressed the issue of royalty on take-or-pay payments inthe discussion of general comments. Readers are requested to refer to thosesections for MMS's discussion concerning these topics. One industry commentwas received which specifically objected to a royalty value floor of noless than gross proceeds. One Indian comment was received concerning theparagraph (g) provisions of take-or-pay payments as related to make-updeliveries. The Indian respondent requested that paragraph (g) be clarifiedsuch that ``a lessee should not be allowed to deduct from royalty paymentsany return of take-or-pay payments required by the lessee in the eventmake up quantities are not available. Royalties on take-or-pay paymentsshould be able to be offset only with make-up deliveries, not royalty adjustments.'' <T3>MMS Response: </T3>With respect to the comment requesting clarificationof the disposition of royalty payments made on take-or-pay payments subsequentlyreturned, MMS would either refund the royalty overpayment or otherwiseprovide a credit against further royalties from that lease. The MMS considersthe lessee's refund of a take-or-pay payment to the purchaser to be tantamountto a retroactive contract price adjustment, thus precipitating necessaryadjustments in previously paid royalties. For this final rulemaking, MMS has amended paragraph (g), deleting referenceto take-or-pay payments. Please refer to the section on general commentsfor MMS's policy on take-or-pay payments. Regarding the comment that objectedto a royalty floor of no less than the lessee's gross proceeds, MMS respondedto this issue in its response at paragraph (c).   <T3>Comment: </T3>After the January 15, 1987, proposed rulemaking, twelveindustry respondents submitted 18 comments concerning andSection;206.257(h),which was intially designated as andSection;206.259(g). Two commenters statedthat there was no need for MMS to charge royalties on additional imputedvalues because the contract price normally reflects the fair value forboth the coal sold and the services provided in connection with the saleof that coal. Four commenters stated that there could be a need for sucha provision, with one particular commenter explaining that ``otherwise,an opportunity for abuse could occur and royalty payments could in someisolated instances partially be avoided by manipulation of contracts.''Four commenters also urged MMS to apply this regulation prospectively tonewly executed contracts, not to existing contractual relationships. Thesecommenters continued to explain that the retroactive application of theprovision of paragraph (h) would create a major disruption in the industry,because the coal industry is replete with existing contractual realtionshipswherein purchasers are providing certain services or facilities which normallywould be the responsibility of the lessee. One commenter objected on thebasis that ``the rules create some sort of an operational warranty on thelessee's activity under the lease. We know of no authorization of suchan express warranty.'' One commenter objected to paragraph (h) because``MMS should not collect a royalty on the increased value of coal resultingfrom beneficiation.'' This commenter further questioned ``how the ownerof a raw product can value it to a lessee on the basis of what it willbe worth after the lessee spends the money to upgrade the product.'' Onecommenter claimed, ``Paragraph (g) [h] imposes a lease term not presentlycontained in the existing Federal coal leases, namely that the lessee isrequired to place coal in a marketable condition.'' Three other commenterstook a similar position, stating that the provisions of paragraph (h) haveno basis in law. Three commenters requested that MMS retain the currentregulations (30 CFR 203.200) and supported their position by stating thatparagraph (h) was unnecessary and what constitutes marketable conditionwas vague. <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS has retained paragraph (h) as originallywritten (originally designated as paragraph (g)) in the proposed regulationspublished January 15, 1987. The MMS responsibilities regarding paragraph(h) will be upheld in considering both past and future coal sales contracts.The MMS does not now allow Federal or Indian royalties to be avoided throughsales contracts which require purchasers to fulfill services that are normallythe responsibility of the lessee. Allowing a sale price to be reduced becausethe purchaser performs certain normal mine preparation services which typicallyfall to the lessee or mine operator represents an indirect, but neverthelessjust as real, deduction from royalties for the cost of placing coal inmarketable condition. The MMS and its predecessor agency have always requiredthat lessees place lease production in marketable condition without costto the Federal or Indian lessor. This practice has not been changed inthese final regulations. Additional discussion of this issue is found inMMS's general comments response regarding ``marketable condition'' and``grandfathering.''   <T3>Comment: </T3>Numerous comments were received after the July 15, 1988,notice regarding andSection;206.259(e), now redesignated as andSection;206.257(i).Twenty-three industry, one Indian, and one State respondent submitted 35comments. Thirteen industry commenters specifically called for the deletionof this paragraph. Nine industry commenters object to ``second guessing''by MMS. One commenter particularly noted this paragraph would make MMSa party to sales contracts. Two commenters stated that paragraph (i) wasunworkable, with one commenter explaining that unless MMS increases staffingrequirements to analyze contracts ``that they [MMS] are not in the positionto interpret the contract or any subsequent amendments.'' Five industrycommenters believed this paragraph would prevent compromise between thelessee and the buyer and, as one other commenter explained, ``would resultin a * * * flooding of the courts with unnecessary litigation merely tojustify a position.'' One industry commenter stated that the third sentence,requiring contract amendments to be in writing, was in conflict with thedefinition of ``contract'' in these proposed regulations.  One Indian respondent objected to the provision of paragraph (i) allowingcontract amendments to be retroactive. The commenter further stated that``the lessee should not be able to compromise the lessor's right to receiveroyalty payments pursuant to the original contract and not under any amendmentsthat have compromised the price.'' Two industry commenters objected tothe provisions of paragraph (i) because the provision would be unfair tothe consumer. As one commenter explained, ``[T]he coal producer will alwaysbe able to argue that the consumer or purchaser should agree to some higherprice since that is what MMS would set in any event since the producer,under federal regulations, has an affirmative obligation to extract themaximum possible price from the coal consumer.'' Two industry commentersstated that paragraph (i) was unwarranted, with one commenter further explainingthat there is no ``reason to presume that a producer will not obtain themaximum consideration allowed under its contracts.'' One State respondentcountered this presumption, stating that ``failure on somebody's part toenforce the contract is, according to one auditor's experience, not atall hypothetical. They [the auditors] have found instances where a companyhas simply neglected to invoice for several years for a payment they weredefinitely entitled to under the contract.''  <T3>MMS Response: </T3>Paragraph (i) was revised in the July 15, 1988,notice to eliminate the ``could receive'' language but emphasizes thatroyalty is due on all benefits to which the lessee is legally entitled.The rule also limits any effect on royalty due to retroactive contractrevisions to a two-year historical period.  Paragraph (i) imposes a diligence requirement on lessees. This sectionwould require a lessee to pay royalty in accordance with its contract price,but also expressly would recognize that contract prices may be amendedretroactively. Retroactive price adjustments would be limited to 2 years.The MMS is aware that often there is a process of negotiation that occursbefore the contract is formally amended and that lower payments may bereceived in the interim. Royalties may be paid on the gross proceeds receivedby the lessee until all reasonable attempts to force the purchaser to renegotiatethe contract or to comply with the existing contract are exhausted, providedthe lessee takes proper and timely action to receive prices or benefitsto which it is entitled, or to revise the contract retroactively. Thus,the MMS will accept a renegotiated or a revised contract price if the mainreason for renegotiating or revising the contract is not solely to reduceroyalties. The phrase ``applies to price increases only and'' has beendeleted from the last paragraph to eliminate excess redundancy. However,if a higher price can be legally enforceable under a contract and the lesseeis not diligent in obtaining that price, royalties will be due on thathigher price.   <T3>Comment: </T3>In response to the July 15, 1988, notice, several commentersrepeated the allegation that paragraph (i) would allow the MMS to ``secondguess'' industry practices, and suggested that this provision be deleted. <T3>MMS Response: </T3>These regulations reflect MMS's willingness generallyto accept arm's-length contract prices as value, but there is a concomitantobligation on the part of the lessee to obtain all to which the lesseeis entitled under its contract. If it fails to take such reasonable measures,MMS will assess royalty on the prices which reasonably could have beenobtained in accordance with the contract.   <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters objected to the requirement that contractrevisions or amendments must be in writing and signed by all parties. Thecommenters stated that this requirement obstructed normal business practicesin their day-to-day administration of coal sales contracts and constitutedundue interference by the government.  <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS does not intend to interfere in the day-to-dayadministration of contracts. The MMS believes that the consideration flowingfrom buyer to seller is the best measure of the parties' interpretationof their sales agreement. This provision is included in the final ruleto ensure that any retroactive price reduction, and thus any claim by thelessee for refunds or credits, is legally enforceable.   <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed concern that a two year limitationto retroactively change value could impose an undue burden on the lesseewhere non-arm's-length value has been determined by prices reported toa public utility commission. The commenter stated that public utility commissionsoften rule on fuel costs three to five years after they have been includedin rates and adjust them retroactively. Another commenter approved of MMS'srestriction of limiting retroactive price changes to two years. <T3>MMS Response: </T3>Paragraph (i) provides that retroactive adjustmentsto value will be limited to two years unless MMS approves a longer period.In a situation such as the one described a longer period would be approved.Paragraph (k) was published in the January 15, 1987, proposed rulemaking,as paragraph (i) and modified slightly in the July 15, 1988, notice tospecifically note that the rights to information by Indian lessors arenot diminished by this paragraph.The release of financial and confidential information for Federal solidmineral leases is subject to the Department of the Interior's (Department)regulations for releasing this type of data to the public. See 43 CFR 2.13.It is the policy of the Department to make the records available to thepublic to the greatest extent possible, in keeping with the spirit of theFreedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. It is the policy of MMSto make available information requested under the FOIA at the earliestpossible date, while, at the same time, protecting the rights of individualsinvolved, and the administrative processes surrounding such rights. Italso is the policy of the Department to withhold information falling withinone of the FOIA exemptions only if (1) disclosure is prohibited by statuteor Executive Order, or (2) sound grounds exist for not releasing such information.Accordingly, MMS considers certain information submitted by a person orentity privileged and financially confidential. We recognize the criticalimportance of this information to the success and competitive positionof a business. Therefore, MMS does not release this information withoutthe permission of the submitter. However, MMS will, to the extent legallypermitted, release proprietary data to any State or Indian tribe upon asatisfactory explanation of why this particular data is necessary and followingthe execution of a binding written agreement to safeguard the proprietarydata.Section 206.259 Determination of Washing Allowances.In the July 15, 1988 (53 FR 26942), notice, MMS discussed various changesthat had occurred from the January 15, 1987, proposed rulemaking. The MMSnoted that the allowance limits had been eliminated. The MMS also providedits rationale for that modification. Another change from the January 15,1987, proposed rulemaking was the substitution of the interest rate associatedwith Standard and Poor's industrial BBB rate in place of Moody's Aaa corporatebond rate. This interest rate is used to compute the return on investmentcomponent in non-arm's-length allowance calculations. An extensive explanationof this change is provided in the preambles to the final oil and gas productvaluation rules published on January 15, 1988 (Oil_53 FR 1212-1214; Gas_53FR 1262-1263, respectively).<T3>Comment: </T3>In the July 15, 1988, notice, MMS also requested commentson providing an exception to the cost-based approach for non-arm's-lengthallowance computation. The MMS explained that in certain circumstanceswhere the gas plant operator provides the same services under arm's-lengthcontracts as it does for itself, the arm's-length contract processing costscan be substituted in place of actual costs. The MMS requested whethera similar provision should be included for coal washing.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS received no comments on this proposal; therefore,the final rule contains no such provision.<T3>Comment: </T3>Many comments received by MMS pursuant to the January15, 1987, proposed rulemaking were not addressed at the time of the July15, 1988, notice. To the extent these comments continue to be relevantto the July 15, 1988, publication, they are addressed below.Two industry commenters specifically recommended that the allowance shouldbe based on the added value, not the cost incurred. One commenter explained,``The lessee's royalty obligations end once the coal is first placed ina marketable condition, and that is the point at which royalty value shouldbe determined.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS believes that determining the value addedwould be subjective, difficult to implement, and would require additionalrulemaking. The reasonable, actual cost of coal washing is the preferredmethod to arrive at an appropriate allowance.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two industry commenters specifically endorsed MMS's proposalto continue coal washing allowances. Eighteen other industry commentersrecommended that MMS extend the allowance to include all forms of beneficiation(processing). According to one commenter, coal processing would encompasscoal washing, ``pelletizing; beneficiation; treatment with substances includingchemicals or oil; drying; and subsequent handling which occurs after coalis first placed in a marketable condition.'' Three Indian and one industryrespondent opposed granting any washing allowances, with one Indian commentergoing further to recommend that ``no allowances be given for any type ofcoal beneficiation.'' This commenter reasoned, ``To provide for allowancesfor all types of coal beneficiation will create a bureaucratic nightmare* * *.'' One industry commenter recommended deleting all allowances as``unnecessary under * * * market value standards.'' This commenter explainedthat market value would be determined ``by current sales of comparableunwashed coal.'' One Indian commenter opposed an allowance because ``apractice which is primarily a conservation measure does not belong in regulationsto value the product for royalty purposes.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The regulations continue the historic practice ofallowing deductions for the cost of coal washing from the sale proceedsof cleaned coal. See 30 CFR 211.63, May 17, 1976, 41 FR 20271, for originalpolicy. The MMS believes that improving the quality of domestic energyresources is in the national interest. The allowance procedure will notbe difficult to implement and should be less difficult to administer thanthe procedure that was in effect under the prior rules. Treating coal withoil or chemicals in order to suppress dust and/or improve handling is consideredto be the responsibility of the lessee to place coal in a marketable condition.Any payment for such activities therefore is a component of gross proceeds,if this treatment is required by the purchaser.<T3>Comment: </T3>One industry commenter proposed an alternative methodfor calculating allowances using the previously discussed Internal RevenueCode (IRC) ``depletion income'' method of valuing coal. A ``processingallowance'' would be subtracted from the ``depletion income'' before theroyalty rate is applied to the resulting ``net royalty value.'' The allowancewould be calculated by multiplying the ``depletion income'' by a fraction,``the numerator of which is the cost of all post marketable condition processesand handling [after crushing and sizing] and the denominator of which isthe total costs of all pre and post marketable condition processes andhandling.'' This commenter justified this method as being more advantageousthan the ``complex and inadequate concept proposed by MMS'' because itis (1) simple to calculate ``based on available information and easilyaudited''; (2) used by other State and Federal ``agencies with satisfactoryresults''; (3) eliminates ``potential for excessive deductions''; and (4)results in a ``fair'' allowance.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS has carefully reviewed the underlying principlesand history of the proportionate profits method and has concluded thatit has no application for determining washing allowances for royalty purposes.The proportionate profits formula is a specific procedure under IRS regulationsto determine the ``gross income from mining'' for depletion allowance incometax purposes when representative field or market prices are unavailableor inapplicable.The outcome of the proportionate profits formula is elimination from thedepletion allowance of all nonmining costs. Its purpose is to establisha representative market or field price for integrated miner/manufacturersonly when representative prices cannot be obtained in the area. Its intentis to place integrated miner/manufacturers on the same depletion allowancebasis as ordinary nonintegrated miners, thus providing no unfair tax advantageto the integrated firms.The proportionate profits method is premised on the theory that each dollarof total costs, including nonmining applications, earns the same percentageof profits as mining processes. Assuming this principle to be uniformlytrue, and it is not (for example, see <T3>Hugoton Production Company</T3> v. <T3>The United States,</T3> 349 F. 2d 418 (cl. ct. 1965)), it is improperto extrapolate this principle to situations which involve deductions forthe ordinary mining processes. The workings of the marketplace suggestthat if a mine product has not been prepared to meet the minimum acceptableconditions that are customary for the market, then that mined product maynot be saleable and, hence, would have no value in the normal sense ofthe term. For these reasons MMS does not accept the proportionate profitsformula to determine any allowance for royalty purposes. <T3>Comment:</T3> Two Indian commenters stated that the regulations wereunclear with respect to when allowances would be approved. One commenteralso stated, ``The preamble to the rules also states that coal washingallowances will be allowed when they enhance the value of the coal. Butthe regs *** do not require any showing that there is an enhancement ***.''<T3>MMS Response:</T3> Allowance forms showing recorded costs are to besubmitted to MMS. Regulations on the timing of form submittal are providedat andSection;206.259 (c) and (e). With respect to the latter comments, MMSbelieves that a prudent lessee would to take up the task and incur theexpense of washing coal unless the process ultimately increases the valueor marketability of the coal. <T3>Comment:</T3> One Indian comment stated ``inclusion of ad valorem propertytaxes in allowable operating costs should not include taxes imposed bythe Navajo Nation.'' <T3>MMS Response:</T3> To the extent that property taxes are levied directlyupon washing equipment or to the extent that it can be demonstrated thatproperty taxes are allocable to washing equipment, MMS believes that suchtaxes should be included in the cost basis for allowance calculation. Suchtaxes represent costs just as real to the lessee as labor, materials, utilities,fuel, or other direct costs. <T3>Comment:</T3> One Indian comment recommended that the language of theregulations be clarified such ``that no profit can be included in the costof washing ***.'' One State commenter stated ``if washing allowances areprovided for, we see no reason to factor a profit component into the lessee'scost. A profit is not guaranteed to a lessee mining federal coal ***.''<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The return on investment component of non-arm's-lengthallowances is not a profit component. Rather, this component is intendedto represent a fair rate of return to capital. The MMS has solicited andreceived significant comments on what would constitute a fair return underthese circumstances. The MMS believes based on these comments that theStandard and Poors BBB bond rate represents a rational choice among alternatives.Regarding andSection;206.258(b)(2), MMS has removed the word ``initial''before the phrase ``depreciable investment in the wash plant ***.'' Thisterm caused confusion. It was not MMS's intent to exclude costs incurredafter the original construction of the wash plant. Rather, total investmentwas the intent. <T3>Comment:</T3> Two comments discussed paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A), whichprohibits altering the depreciation schedule initially established by theoriginal owner of a coal wash plant. One Indian commenter agreed with thisstipulation. An industry commenter disagreed stating, ``A buyer will almostinevitably assign a new and different value to acquired assets. Such valuewill often exceed the previous owner [sic] book value, and establishesthe new basis upon which future depreciation is calculated ***.'' <T3>MMS Response:</T3> In MMS's judgment, the simple change of capitalasset ownership does not create a situation requiring asset depreciationto be repeated. However, any additional retooling, refurbishing, retrofitting,or other capital improvements would necessarily be added to the capitalinvestment base and depreciated accordingly. <T3>Comment:</T3> Following the July 15, 1988, notice, several additionalcomments were received concerning washing allowances. In general, Indiancomments opposed allowances for washing. State commenters expressed supportfor washing allowances. Industry generally favored washing allowances andin particular expressed support for the elimination of any limit to theallowance cost. However, one industry commenter opposed the granting ofwashing allowances. Two comments were received that expressed concern overthe use of Standard and Poor's BBB industrial bond rate for non-arm's-lengthallowance determinations. One commenter stated that the ``[j]ustificationfor the use of the rate in 52 FR 1212-1214 concerns the risk associatedwith mineral-related projects. However, washing and transportation, eventransportation using new technologies, are ancillary services. The riskis in the mining of coal.'' <T3>MMS Response:</T3> As stated earlier, MMS has examined the use of theStandards and Poor's BBB industrial bond rate carefully and has concludedthat the use of such rate would be appropriate for use as an allowed rateof return for washing and transportation of coal. Section 206.260 Allocation of washed coal <T3>Comment:</T3> Following the January 15, 1987, proposed rulemaking,five industry respondents submitted five comments concerning andSection;206.261,now designated andSection;206.260. Two commenters agreed with the proceduresto allocate washed coal back to the leases from which it was produced.Four respondents recommended substituting the term ``processed'' for ``washed''in order to be consistent with their other proposals to expand washingallowances to include other forms of beneficiation. <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS did not amend andSection;206.261 when redesignatingto andSection;206.260 in the July 15, 1988, notice and has not changed andSection;206.260for this final rulemaking. For the MMS response to the washing/processingissue, please refer to the MMS responses to comments at andSection;206.265.Sectin 206.262 Determination of transportation allowances. In the July 15, 1988 (53 FR 26942), notice, MMS discussed various changesthat were made to the January 15, 1987, proposed rulemaking. The MMS notedthat the allowance limits had been eliminated. The MMS also provided itsrationale for that modification. Another change from the January 15, 1987,proposed rulemaking was the substitution of the interest rate associatedwith Standard and Poor's industrial BBB rate in place of Moody's Aaa corporatebond rate. This interest rate is used to compute the return on investmentcomponent in non-arm's-length allowance calculations. An extensive explanationof this change is provided in the preamble to the final oil and gas productvaluation rules published on January 15, 1988 (53 FR 1212-1214 and 53 FR1262-1263, respectively). In order to be consistent with coal washing regulationsat andSection;206.259(d)(1), identical language has been added to andSection;206.262(d)(1),and the reference to penalties has been deleted. <T3>Comment: </T3>In the July 15, 1988, notice, MMS also requested commentson providing an exception to the cost-based approach for non-arm's lengthallowance computation, whereby the lessee could apply to MMS for an exceptionfrom the requirement that it compute actual costs if the lessee has a transportationrate approved by a regulatory authority and the rate is not excessive ascompared to other arm's-length contracts. If there are no other arm's-lengthcontracts to use for comparison, other criteria apply. <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS received no comments on this proposal; therefore,the final rule contains no such provision.<T3>Comment: </T3>Many comments received by MMS pursuant to the Janaury15, 1987, proposed rulemaking were not addressed at the time of the July15, 1988, notice. To the extent these comments continue to be relevantto the July 15, 1988, publication, they are addressed below.<T3>Comment: </T3>The MMS received 24 comments from seven industry, fiveIndian, and two State respondents concerning proposed andSection; 206.261(a)(i).Six industry commenters stated that the term ``remote'' was ambiguous andshould be clarified. One of these commenters specifically stated, ``Thecriteria demands [sic] clear definition.'' One industry and one Indiancommenter requested MMS define the meaning of ``transportation.''Four comments were received on paragraph (a) addressing the requirementthat the point of sale or washing facility be ``remote'' from the leaseor mine. One industry commenter stated, ``It makes no sense to forbid atransportation allowance for sales to the `mine-mouth' customers * * *.''In the same vein, another industry commenter stated, ``MMS should considerinstances where long distances exist between the point of severance andthe washing facility or point of sale which may be located on the samelease or mine area.'' Two other commenters specifically opposed this notion.One Indian commenter requested that the regulation be clarified to ``indicatethat no transportation allowance will be allowed except from the leaseboundary.'' Another Indian commenter suggested that an allowance wouldbe appropriate from the lease boundary to the point of sale.Three comments were received on paragraph (a) concerning what would beconsidered as transportation to a point of sale or washing facility remotefrom the lease or mine. Two industry commenters suggested that any transportationto a point of sale or washing facility greater than one mile from the mineor lease boundary should be eligible for a transportation allowance. Oneof these commenters explained that this standard ``provides much greatercertainty than under the ambiguous remote standard * * *.'' One industrycommenter stated that all transportation should be eligible for allowanceafter the coal is ``severed from the ground and either is removed fromthe lease itself or * * * reaches the surface of the ground'' in the caseof underground mining.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS responded to similar comments earlier inthis preamble in the discussion of andSection; 206.251 Definitions, ``Allowance.''<T3>Comment: </T3>Six commenters addressed other aspects of paragraph (a).One industry commenter stated that the word ``reasonable'' should be deletedas it gives too much discretion to MMS. Two Indian and three State commentersexpressed concern that protections to the lessor that exist in the currentregulations were being abandoned. Two State comments requested that languagebe added which would ensure ``the value will never be less than what valuewould have accrued, had the sale been FOB the mine.'' The other three commentersrequested that the word ``necessary'' be added to this paragraph in orderto provide protection against any potential lessee abuse.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS reiterates its belief that lessees are alsoprudent businessmen and as such are unlikely to undertake operations thatare unnecessary or unreasonable. Since most royalty rates are set at orbelow 12\1/2\ percent, is difficult to contrive a situation where any lesseeinterested in maximizing its allowance would benefit from unnecessary orunreasonable expenditures. For each unnecessary dollar spent the lesseecould only recoupe, at most, the amount equal to the lease royalty, whichis 12.5 cents or less.<T3>Comment: </T3>The MMS received several additional comments followingthe July 15, 1988, notice. Two comments stated that in no case should atransportation allowance be allowed to reduce the value to zero. One commentoffered an alternative proposal: ``Under no circumstances shall the washingallowance and transportation allowance reduce the value to less than thevalue of like quality and quantity coal being sold from the area underan arm's-length agreement.'' Another comment stated there should be someabsolute limit to the allowance deduction.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS does not believe any threshold or limitto allowances is necessary. The rules provide that the allowances cannotreduce the value for royalty purposes to zero. Limiting transportationallowances to amounts such that the royalty value of destination saleswould not fall below the royalty value of f.o.b. mine sales does representone test available to MMS in reviewing allowances, but it does not constitutethe conclusive action that would be taken by MMS. In keeping with the generalfree-market themes that underpin this rulemaking, MMS believes that thelessee normally is striving to attain the greatest return. When the lesseemust incur additional costs to transport coal to remote sales destinations,the presumption is that those additional costs were necessary because themarket for f.o.b. mine sales was saturated. The MMS has no intention ofsecond guessing prudent business judgments made by lessees in responseto their market assessments.<T3>Comment: </T3>One comment advised MMS to exercise caution when reviewingtransportation allowances as some lessees may attempt to manipulate thepoint of sale to benefit from a transportation allowance.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS will diligently review transportation allowances,applying the criteria stated above in MMS's discussion of ``Allowance''at andSection; 206.251 Definitions.Other changes made to the transportation allowance section are the sameas those discussed above for washing allowances.Section 206.263 Contract submissionAfter the January 15, 1987, proposed rulemaking, the MMS received manycomments opposing the requirement to submit contracts to MMS upon request.The MMS responded to those comments and others in the July 15, 1988, notice.In response to the July 15, 1988, notice, several commenters again objectedto the contract submittal requirement.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS intends to review contracts during on-siteaudits. However, the MMS must retain the right to obtain sales contractsor other agreements from Federal or Indian lessees. The MMS will take allnecessary precautions to safeguard contracts from unauthorized disclosure.The section has not changed from the July 15, 1988, notice.Section 206.264 In-situ and surface gasification and liquefaction operations<T3>Comment: </T3>The MMS received several comments from industry respondentson this section. Two industry commenters stated that this section providedexcessive authority to MMS to determine value. As one commenter explained,``The result [of MMS authority] will be a dampening effect on the developmentof new technologies.''Three industry commenters recommended that MMS's valuation authority berestricted to in-situ processes only and that post mining processes suchas liquefaction and thermal drying be excluded from royalty valuation byapplying the provisions of andSection; 206.257 to the value of feedstockcoal when it first becomes marketable. One of these commenters explained,``The lessor should share in the benefit of such processes only to theextent of royalty at the prescribed rate on the value of feedstock coal* * *.'' One commenter recommended that if MMS authority was not restrictedby the changes suggested ``[i]t would be more appropriate to delete thissection, place it in a reserved category and reconsider it in the future.''One industry respondent recommended no changes to proposed andSection; 206.264.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS does not envision that the development ofnew coal technologies will be dampened by andSection; 206.264, which merelystates that MMS will determine the royalty value of production developedby in situ or surface gasification or liquefaction technology. Historically,Federal treatment of developing technologies with reference to federalresources has ben accommodating. As noted previously in the preamble andSection;206.265 has been added since the January 15, 1987, proposed rulemaking,in response to the comments received.Section 206.265 Value enhancement of marketable coal In order to address concerns that MMS would assess royalties on the valueadded by new beneficiation technologies, such as ``deep thermal drying,''or ``coal pelletization,'' andSection; 206.265 was added to the July 15,1988, notice. This section would also apply to surface gasification orliquefaction, if coal is placed in marketable condition prior to processingto a different physical or chemical form.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several comments were received that commended the additionof this section. Only one Indian commented that these beneficiation processeswere for the purpose of placing lease products in marketable conditionand that royalty should be asessed on the total value of products sold.Two comments were received that stated when a net-back valuation was necessary,two times the Standard and Poor's BBB industrial bond rate was appropriatefor high risk ventures. Two commenters expressed concern that two timesthe BBB industrial bond rate may be excessive and requested that the ratebe reviewed before publication of final rules.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS has retained the rate of return componentin paragraph (b) at two times the Standard and Poor's industrial BBB rate.The MMS does not consider this rate as excessive. It is a well-establishedeconomic principle that the incremental cost of funds are a function ofboth the general economy and the results of operation of the individualcompany. The results of operation consider prior investments. In this case,we are dealing with new and evolving technologies without much prior experience.Given this reality, it is not appropriate to apply the industry standardfor rate of return when the project is known to be complex and a high riskventure. For extremely risky operations such as the Great Plains Coal GasificationProject in North Dakota, the General Accounting Office (GAO) estimatedan internal rate of return over the life of the gasification project tobe between 14 percent and 19 percent (GAO/RCED-85-92, May 28, 1985). Thisproject also had Government price guarantees. For other more risky projects,higher rates recognize the risk associated with the project and exceedthe industry and standard for cost of capital. The MMS therefore concludesthat, in net-back valuations, proper rate of return for beneficiation projectsshould be 2 times the industrial BBB rate.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Procedural Matters</ITAG>Executive Order 12291The Department of the Interior (DOI) has determined that this documentis not a major rule and does not require a regulatory analysis under ExecutiveOrder 12291. This rulemaking consolidates Federal and Indian coal royaltyvaluation regulations; clarifies DOI coal royalty valuation and coal transportationand coal washing allowance policy; and provides for consistent royaltyvaluation policy among all leasable minerals. Regulatory Flexibility Act Because this rule primarily consolidates and streamlines existing regulationsinto a single part for consistent application, there are no significantadditional requirements or burdens placed upon small business entitiesas a result of implication of this rule. Therefore, the DOI has determinedthat this rulemaking will not have a significant economic effect on a substantialnumber of small entities and does not require a regulatory flexibilityanalysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 The information collection requirements contained in andSection;andSection;206.254, 206.257, 206.259, 206.262, and 206.263 of this rule have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 44 U.S.C. 3501et seq. and assigned clearance number 1010-0040, -0063, -0064, and -0074.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto vary from one-half hour to 3 hours per response with an average of 1.5hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searchingexisting data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completingand reviewing the collection of information. Due to the complexity of theinformation requested, applications for allowances using Forms MMS-4292and MMS-4293 in non-arm's-length or no-contract situations may requireup to an estimated 40 hours per response.

(6) The value of production for royalty purposes shall not include paymentsreceived by the lessee pursuant to a contract which the lessee demonstrates,to MMS's satisfaction, were not part of the total consideration paid forthe purchase of coal production. (c)(1) The value of coal from leases subject to this section and whichis not sold pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be determined inaccordance with this section. (2) If the value of the coal cannot be determined pursuant to paragraph(b) of this section, then the value shall be determined through applicationof other valuation criteria. The criteria shall be considered in the followingorder, and the value shall be based upon the first applicable criterion:(i) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale underits non-arm's-length contract (or other disposition of produced coal byother than an arm's-length contract), provided that those gross proceedsare within the range of the gross proceeds derived from, or paid under,comparable arm's-length contracts between buyers and sellers neither ofwhom is affiliated with the lessee for sales, purchases, or other dispositionsof like-quality coal produced in the area. In evaluating the comparabilityof arm's-length contracts for the purposes of these regulations, the followingfactors shall be considered: Price, time of execution, duration, marketor markets served, terms, quality of coal, quantity, and such other factorsas may be appropriate to reflect the value of the coal; (ii) Prices reported for that coal to a public utility commission; (iii) Prices reported for that coal to the Energy Information Administrationof the Department of Energy; (iv) Other relevant matters including, but not limited to, published orpublicly available spot market prices, or information submitted by thelessee concerning circumstances unique to a particular lease operationor the saleability of certain types of coal; (v) If a reasonable value cannot be determined using paragraphs (c)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section, then a net-back method or anyother reasonable method shall be used to determine value. (3) When the value of coal is determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) ofthis section, that value determination shall be consistent with the provisionscontained in paragraphs (b)(5) and (b)(6) of this section, as appropriate.(d)(1) Where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of thissection, that value does not require MMS's prior approval. However, thelessee shall retain all data relevant to the determination of royalty value.Such data shall be subject to review and audit, and MMS will direct a lesseeto use a different value if it determines that the reported value is inconsistentwith the requirements of these regulations. (2) Any Federal or Indian lessee will make available upon request to theauthorized MMS, State, or Indian representatives, or to the Inspector Generalof the Department of the Interior or other persons authorized to receivesuch information, arm's-length sales and sales quantity data for like-qualitycoal sold, purchased, or otherwise obtained by the lessee from the area.(3) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value pursuant to paragraphs(c)(2) (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section. The notification shallbe by letter to the Associate Director for Royalty Management of his/herdesignee. The letter shall identify the valuation method to be used andcontain a brief description of the procedure to be followed. The notificationrequired by this section is a one-time notification due no later than themonth the lessee first reports royalties on the Form MMS-4014 using a valuationmethod authorized by paragraphs (c)(2) (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of thissection, and each time there is a change in a method under paragraphs (c)(2)(iv) or (v) of this section. (e) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined value,the lessee shall be liable for the difference, if any, between royaltypayments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty paymentsthat are due based upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shallalso be liable for interest computed pursuant to 30 CFR 218.202. If thelessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide instructions for the takingof that credit. (f) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that event,the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method, and may usethat method in determining value for royalty purposes until MMS issuesits decision. The lessee shall submit all available data relevant to itsproposal. The MMS shall expeditiously determine the value based upon thelessee's proposal and any additional information MMS deems necessary. Thatdetermination shall remain effective for the period stated therein. AfterMMS issues its determination, the lessee shall make the adjustments inaccordance with paragraph (e) of this section.(g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, under no circumstancesshall the value for royalty purposes be less than the gross proceeds accruingto the lessee for the deposition of produced coal less applicable exclusionsof paragraphs (b)(5) and (b)(6) of this section and less applicable allowancesdetermined pursuant to andSection;andSection; 206.258 through 206.262, andandSection; 206.265 of this subpart.(h) The lessee is required to place coal in marketable condition at nocost to the Federal Government or Indian lessor. Where the value establishedpursuant to this section is determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, thatvalue shall be increased to the extent that the gross proceeds has beenreduced because the purchaser, or any other person, is providing certainservices, the cost of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the lesseeto place the coal in marketable condition.(i) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can receivethrough legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent contractrevision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or timely actionto receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled, it must pay royaltyat a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. Contract revisionsor amendments shall be in writing and signed by all parties to an arm's-lengthcontract, and may be retroactively applied to value for royalty purposesfor a period not to exceed two years, unless MMS approves a longer period.If the lessee makes timely application for a price increase allowed underits contract but the purchaser refuses, and the tessee takes reasonablemeasures, which are documented, to force purchaser compliance, the lesseewill owe no additional royalties unless or until monies or considerationresulting from the price increase are received. This paragraph shall notbe construed to permit a lessee to avoid its royalty payment obligationin situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in part or timely,for a quantity of coal.(j) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the contrary,no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process that resultsin a redetermination by the MMS of value under this section shall be consideredfinal or binding as against the Federal Government, its beneficiaries,the Indian Tribes, or allottees until the audit period is formally closed.(k) Certain information submitted to MMS to support valuation proposals,including transportation, coal washing, or other allowances pursuant toandSection; 206.265 of this subpart, is exempted from disclosure by the Freedomof Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 522. Any data specified by the Act to be privileged,confidential, or otherwise exempt shall be maintained in a confidentialmanner in accordance with applicable law and regulations. All requestsfor information about determinations made under this Part are to be submittedin accordance with the Freedom of Information Act regulation of the Departmentof the Interior, 43 CFR Part 2.

However, before anydeduction may be taken, the lessee must submit a completed page one ofForm MMS-4292, Coal Washing Allowance Report, in accordance with paragraph(c)(1) of this section. A washing allowance may be claimed retroactivelyfor a period of not more than 3 months prior to the first day of the monththat Form MMS-4292 is filed with MMS, unless MMS approves a longer periodupon a showing of good cause by the lessee.(2) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the contractreflects more than the consideration actually transferred either directlyor indirectly from the lessee to the washer for the washing. If the contractreflects more than the total consideration paid, then the MMS may requirethat the washing allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b)of this section.(3) If the MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an arm's-lengthwashing contract does not reflect the reasonable value of the washing becauseof misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because the lesseeotherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market the productionfor the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor, then MMS shall requirethat the washing allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b)of this section.

All washing allowances deductd undera non-arm's-length or no contract situation are subject to monitoring,review, audit, and possible future adjustment. Prior MMS approval of washingallowances is not required for non-arm's-length or no contract situations.However, before any estimated or actual deduction may be taken, the lesseemust submit a completed Form MMS-4292 in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)of this section. A washing allowance may be claimed retroactively for aperiod of not more than 3 months prior to the first day of the month thatForm MMS-4292 is filed with MMS, unless MMS approves a longer period upona showing of good cause by the lessee. The MMS will monitor the allowancededuction to ensure that deductions are reasonable and allowable. Whennecessary or appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to modify its estimatedor actual washing allowance.(2) The washing allowance for non-arm's-length or no contract situationsshall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for washing during the reportedperiod, including operating and maintenance expenses, overhead, and eitherdepreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment in accordancewith paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the depreciableinvestment in the wash plant multiplied by the rate of return in accordancewith paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section.

State and Federal income taxesand severance taxes, including royalities, are not allowable expenses.(iv) A lessee may use either paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section.After a lessee has elected to use either method for a wash plant, the lesseemay not later elect to change to the other alternative without approvalof the MMS.(A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a straight-linedepreciation method based on the life of equipment or on the life of thereserves which the wash plant services, whichever is appropriate, or aunit of production method. After an election is made, the lessee may notchange methods without MMS approval. A change in ownership of a wash plantshall not alter the depreciation schedule established by the original operator/lesseefor purposes of the allowance calculation. With or without a change inownership, a wash plant shall be depreciated only once.

The initial reporting may be based on estimated costs.(ii) The initial Form MMS-4292 shall be effective for a reporting periodbeginning the month that the lessee first is authorized to deduct a washingallowance and shall continue until the end of the calendar year, or untilthe washing under the non-arm's-length contract or the no contract situationterminates, whichever is earlier.(iii) For calendar-year reporting periods succeeding the initial reportingperiod, the lessee shall submit a completed Form MMS-4292 containing theactual costs for the previous reporting period. If coal washing is continuing,the lessee shall include on Form MMS-4292 its estimated costs for the nextcalendar year. The estimated coal washing allowance shall be based on theactual costs for the previous period plus or minus any adjustments whichare based on the lessee's knowledge of decreases or increases which willaffect the allowance.
