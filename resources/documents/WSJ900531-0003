Can weall get along with Mrs. Thatcher?), a new Europe will startbusiness in 1992. People, money and trade will flow freelyacross borders without the restrictions that now apply.   Some Americans are frightened by the prospect of thisdevelopment. They figure that the free internal market willproduce much larger and more competitive European firms thatwill win sales away from U.S. companies both in Europe andelsewhere. They fear that the Europeans will becomeincreasingly protectionist, trying to guard their expandedmarket against Americans and all other outsiders.</LP><TEXT>   Such fears are by no means new. When the Common Market wasfounded in 1958, there were many who saw a plot to screen outAmerican goods. One result was a continuing increase in U.S.investment in plant and equipment in Europe -- an investmentthat helps to make the Europe '92 fears largely unfounded.   Whether by plan or by luck, such investment prepared U.S.firms both for the EC as it was and the EC as it evolved. Thecommunity was formed in 1958 with six members: Belgium,France, Italy, West Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.Over the years the group added Denmark, Greece, Ireland, theUnited Kingdom, Spain and Portugal. When a new nationentered, it usually was already a base for U.S. firms.   The prime example is the U.K., which became a member ofthe EC in 1973. In 1966, not surprisingly, our neighborCanada was the host to the largest number of American firms,but the U.K. already ranked second or third in mostindustries.   As a result, there has been no last-minute surge of U.S.investment in the EC to prepare for Europe '92. In NationalBureau of Economic Research Working Paper No. 3293, Robert E.Lipsey of Queens College says the lack of expansion plans byU.S. companies already in the EC may reflect satisfactionwith their current positions. &quot;There is a widespread feelingthat American firms already established in Europe are alreadyahead of European firms in treating the EC as a singlemarket,&quot; Mr. Lipsey writes.   The author quotes a British magazine, the Economist, assaying that General Motors and Ford have more &quot;Europewidestrength&quot; than any of their local competitors, strong thoughmany of them may be in their own national markets. The sameis true in their fields for other American companies such asIBM, Digital Equipment and Unisys.   Protectionism is no particular worry, moreover, becauseU.S. manufacturing affiliates and even wholesale tradeaffiliates in the EC are largely independent of imports fromthe U.S. For manufacturing affiliates, imports from the U.S.account for about 5% of sales in the EC.   A lot of the merger and acquisition activity in the recentpast and in the near future is likely to involve Europeancompanies seeking partners to extend their reach more widelyaround Europe. The Economist suggests that some EC firms maytry to do this with mergers, joint ventures or otherarrangements with U.S. firms already in Europe.   U.S. companies now outside the EC are in fact engaging insome such transactions with EC firms; sometimes the primebeneficiary is the U.S. firm. General Mills, for instance,has announced a venture with Nestle to sell breakfast food inEurope where General Mills's main rival, Kellogg, is alreadyentrenched as a producer. The cost of the plan was estimatedin the tens of millions, not an amount that would qualify asa major international investment.   The available evidence indicates it is unlikely that therewill be any rush of U.S. firms to enter Europe before 1992.&quot;It is hard to find evidence on rates of new entry,&quot; Mr.Lipsey says, &quot;but a survey conducted for KPMG Peat Marwick,among a sample of executives in almost 600 companies in hightechnology, other manufacturing, transportation, andmerchandising, found that of those (29% of the total) notcurrently doing business in the EC, over two thirds said theyhad no plans to do business there either before or after1992.&quot;   Only 6% of the sample project some sort of entry into theEC before 1992. Surveys indicate a large proportion of thenew entrants will opt for joint ventures -- an unusualdecision for U.S. firms, which usually prefer 100% ownershipor at least majority control of any foreign operations.Opting for joint ventures obviously limits the investment,and thus it is not a strong indication of a pell-mell rush toparticipate. Some of the joint venturers may be smallerfirms, interested in a piece of the action but unable to buya large piece.   Another reason for U.S. firms to participate in jointventures, Mr. Lipsey suggests, is to have an opportunity toenter markets dominated by public procurement; that probablyled to the recently launched joint ATandamp;T-Philips venture toproduce telecommunications equipment.   There is no intention here to suggest that U.S. companiesare losing interest in doing business in Europe -- or areblind to the 1992 deadline. Some companies are enteringEurope for the first time, and when this happens the firmsnearly always list 1992 as one of the reasons. It was citedlast year, for instance, when Intel announced plans to builda $400 million computer plant in Ireland.   But U.S. corporations have been doing business in Europefor a very long time, and they're accustomed to the fact thatthe rules and circumstances sometimes do change in Europe,pretty much as they do in the U.S. An intelligent U.S.businessman tries to stay alert and, if possible, adjust tosuch changes even before they happen.   This time, at least, it looks like the Yanks did a prettygood job.</TEXT></DOC>
