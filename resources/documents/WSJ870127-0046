Before the special gain, the forest products concern's operating profit more than tripled to $16.8 million, or 46 cents a share, from the year earlier, when there were no special items.    Fourth-quarter sales were $382.2 million, up 22% from $312.6 million the year before.    Louisiana-Pacific cited a modestly firming lumber market and strongly rising prices for pulp and paperboard products, along with cost-cutting measures, for the earnings rise.    The $123 million gain stems from a reversal of taxes already paid, in anticipation of receiving additional payment from the federal government in a land-condemnation dispute.    As previously reported, Louisiana-Pacific received $225 million when the government wanted 25,600 acres of the company's northern California timberland for expansion of Redwood National Park. The company has sued for additional compensation and interest, however, and is currently awaiting a judge's verdict in a trial concluded last autumn.    Any additional money received from the government is subject to federal capital gains taxes unless it is reinvested. Louisiana-Pacific said its $315 million purchase of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.'s Kirby Forest Industries Inc. timberland unit, completed in December, qualifies as replacement property, and thus makes the company eligible for the tax reversal.    A company official said the reversal is based on taxes paid when the company's assumption was that it would receive a total of $330 million from the government.    Louisiana-Pacific also said asbestos-related claims against its Fibreboard Corp. unit are being filed at a rate higher than it had anticipated. A total of 11,500 new claims were filed in 1986, the company said, compared with 10,600 in 1985. The company said Louisiana-Pacific's auditor, Arthur Andersen andamp; Co., is &quot;reviewing its opinion&quot; of the company's results in light of the unexpectedly high claim rate, among other things. The Louisiana-Pacific official declined to elaborate on what actions might be taken as a result of the review.    For the year, Louisiana-Pacific's net income, including the tax credit, was $187.9 million, or $5.11 a share. In 1985, the company had net income of $54.9 million, or $1.50 a share, including a $29.4 million credit from an accounting change. Sales rose 19% to $1.51 billion from $1.26 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
