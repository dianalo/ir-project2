A Pillsbury spokesman wouldn't say when an announcement might be forthcoming. &quot;My lips are zipped,&quot; he said last night. Grand Met's $5.23 billion tender offer, which has been extended once, is now set to expire at midnight Tuesday.    Pillsbury stock slipped in moderately heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, closing at $60.875, down 62.5 cents.    Since Grand Met made its surprise bid Oct. 4, Pillsbury has asked shareholders not to tender stock until the company could consider alternatives. Despite repeated requests to negotiate, Grand Met said it hasn't heard from the Minneapolis food and restaurants concern. Meanwhile, no other bidder has appeared.    Following a meeting Oct. 17, Pillsbury's board termed Grand Met's offer inadequate, adding that &quot;now is not the appropriate time to sell . . . and remaining independent would be a superior alternative.&quot;    In a subsequent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it was considering an array of options, including a financial restructuring or recapitalization, a spin-off of some operations, the sale of an equity interest to a third party, or the purchase of Grand Met shares, perhaps in concert with another entity.    Pillsbury's board is being advised by four investment banking firms: First Boston Corp., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Wasserstein, Perella andamp; Co.    Pillsbury has a poison pill in place that would be triggered if anyone acquired 10% or more of its stock. The merits of that defense are to be argued today in Delaware Chancery Court, the same court that earlier this week struck down Interco Inc.'s poison pill.    In London yesterday, Britain's Department of Trade and Industry said that if successful, Grand Met's bid wouldn't be considered anti-competitive. The U.K. distilling, gambling and franchise concern operates several thousand pubs in Britain as well as dairies and food processing companies. Grand Met's U.S. operations include Alpo dog food and Pearle Vision Centers. </TEXT></DOC>
