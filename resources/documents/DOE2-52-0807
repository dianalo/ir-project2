The bellows are driven by an ambienttemperature stepping motor. Flow rates range up to 0.35 L/s, and heliumtemperatures range from 1.25-4.0 K. For the case of a 9.3-mm bore turbinemeter, identical meter factors are found for normal and superfluid helium.For the Venturi meter, discharge coefficients between 0.98 and 1.0 arefound with normal and superfluid helium. 6 references.</TEXT></DOC>
