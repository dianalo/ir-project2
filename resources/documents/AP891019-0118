(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A black political group charged in a lawsuitthat Tampa's mayor and the county's chief judge conspired to sethigh bail to silence activists during a disturbance.   The United Brothers of the Bay Area wants a federal judge todeclare that Mayor Sandy Freedman and Hillsborough Circuit Judge F.Dennis Alvarez plotted to deprive five black people of theirconstitutional rights.   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday, seeks $2 million in damages fromthe Feb. 2 arrest of the five, who were part of a rowdy rock- andbottle-throwing crowd in Tampa's racially tense College Hill publichousing development.   The disturbance erupted following the death of Edgar AllenPrice, a black suspected cocaine dealer who died hogtied in apolice cruiser a night earlier.   The five St. Petersburg residents were charged with inciting toriot and unlawful assembly. Four were members of the AfricanSocalist People's Party.   It came to light four months later that Freedman, worried thetrouble could escalate, talked with Alvarez from a command post.   She said she told him Miami rioters had been kept in jail withhigh bail in January. Alvarez set bail at $100,000. When one personwas found not to be a member of the group, he was released on$1,000 bail.   The other four were held for 36 hours until a different judgereleased them without bail. State prosecutors eventually droppedcharges citing lack of evidence.   United Brothers contends that Freedman and Alvarez had the fivearrested on ``trumped-up'' charges and held under excessive bail inan attempt to interfere with their right to demonstrate.   Freedman and Alvarez have denied any wrongdoing.</TEXT></DOC>
