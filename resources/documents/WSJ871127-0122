Analysts said they received phone calls Wednesday from the office of anti-smoking activist Richard Daynard, a law professor at Northeastern University in Boston, notifying them of a news conference Mr. Daynard plans to hold Tuesday.    By the end of trading Wednesday, the anti-smoking group was backpedaling on the ramifications of its information.    The market is &quot;overreacting,&quot; said David Gidmark, communications director for the Tobacco Products Liability Project.    While he wouldn't reveal the nature of the information, Mr. Gidmark said he didn't expect a major move in stock prices even after the news conference. &quot;I'd very much like to lend a less incendiary&quot; view to the matter, he said.    Mr. Gidmark and other associates of Mr. Daynard stirred up Wall Street by reading a statement that said the news conference would center on &quot;an important document. It is a recent unprecedented admission by the tobacco industry and they thought it would be kept secret.&quot;    The statement said the document would be &quot;highly relevant to more than 100 products liability cases pending nationwide about the industry.&quot;    The tobacco stocks began to plummet Wednesday morning as Mr. Daynard's associates began their calls. The stocks continued sliding through the close of composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Philip Morris Cos. fell $4.25 a share to $89.50; RJR Nabisco Inc. dropped $2.75 a share to $48.50; American Brands Inc. slid $1.75 a share to $41; and UST Inc., declined 75 cents a share to $24.25.    The intent of the statement was apparently to drum up publicity for the news conference. But two major tobacco litigation trials are expected to begin deliberations in January, and tobacco stocks are always sensitive to product-liability issues. In recent months, tobacco product-liability litigation has been dealt a blow by court rulings severely limiting the scope of plaintiffs' claims.    Mr. Daynard &quot;is trying to make some noise and he's definitely hitting the Street,&quot; said Ronald Morrow, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. While Mr. Morrow noted the seriousness of any new information is open to question, he said, &quot;This is an antsy market and any kind of possible negative news is going to be taken seriously.&quot;    Mr. Daynard was vacationing in Florida, Mr. Gidmark said. </TEXT></DOC>
