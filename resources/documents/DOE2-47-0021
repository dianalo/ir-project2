<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-47-0021 </DOCNO><TEXT>A threshold detector designed for recording time dependence of fast neutronflux density in the energy range andgt; 1.5-3.0 MeV in pulsed fields of nuclearreactors is described. The invention is aimed at increasing the accuracyof recording when conserving the possibility of gamma radiation signalcompensation. Detector electrodes are made as plates with the thicknessmore than the avearge length of recoil proton paths and they are seperatedbetween each other and the body by three layers of heterogeneous dielectrics.In this case the thickness of the dielectric arranges between electrodesare larger, and the thickness of two another ones arranged between electrodesand the body, are less than the average length of recoil proton paths.As opposite variant, when the thickness of the dielectrics arranged betweenelectrodes is less and the thickness of two others larger than the averagelength of recoil proton paths, is possible. The detector suggested witha hydrogeneous scatter in comparison with analogous detectors allowsto increase the accuracy of neutron detection by 50-60%. 9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
