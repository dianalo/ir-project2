The siege ended when soldiers stormed a hut on the Kibbutz Lotancollective farm, 12 miles north of the Israeli resort city of Eilatand less than a mile from the Jordan-Israel border.   In Jordan, a military spokesman was quoted as saying theattacker was a Jordanian soldier who had abandoned his post. TheIsraeli army said the gunman, who carried an M-16 rifle, wasapparently deranged.   Hospital officials identified the American as Lauren Rosen, 25,of Englewood, N.J., who was working as a volunteer at the kibbutz.They said she was slightly wounded by a bullet that passed throughher neck.   The hostage, Osnat Lev, was a member of an army unit made up ofsoldiers who live and work on collective farms.   Ms. Rosen was quoted by Israel army radio as saying the attackershouted in English ``It's because of my brother!'' before openingfire on her, the soldier and a third woman in a date grove near thekibbutz. The third woman escaped.   Soldiers stormed the hut in the date grove where the woman washeld after attempting to negotiate with the Jordanian soldier forseveral hours, the radio said. It said his only demand during thenegotiations was for a copy of the Koran, the Moslem holy book,which he was given.   In Amman, Jordan, the military official identified the attackeras Farid Ali Mustafa, a soldier, according to the official Petranews agency.   The senior official, who was not identified, said the soldier``carried out the attack on his own obviously.''   The initial attack came at 11:30 a.m. and the building wasstormed about 3:30 p.m., the army said.   ``A man dressed in military dress came out from behind one ofthe trees and shot one shot, and that was that,'' Ms. Rosen toldIsrael army radio. ``I was very, very lucky. I feel just fine.''   Ms. Lev said the man kept mentioning a dead sister and asked thelocation of Israeli army bases that he could attack.   ``He said all the time that his sister was killed, and why wasshe killed, and why I killed her. So I said I did not kill her atall. He said that the Jews killed her and now he comes to killeverybody,'' said the woman.   She said she had worked as a volunteer on the kibbutz since Juneand would not be frightened away by the attack. She added she wouldprobably stay at the kibbutz several more weeks.   ``It's a very beautiful place even if things like this happen,''she said.   In Tel Aviv, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin used the incident topoint to Israel's efforts to fight terrorism.   ``I believe it is time that the world will realize what is thedifference when we talk about terrorism ... and all the sorts ofatrocities they have carried out, and when the rest of the worldtalks about (it), either from Washington or Paris or London,'' hesaid.   ``For us, fighting terrorism is a matter of night and day, amatter of life and death,'' he told reporters at the DefenseMinistry.   When asked if the attack was by a guerrilla group, Rabin repliedthat it ``was an act by an individual,'' apparently a Jordaniansoldier.   Ms. Rosen was rushed to Eilat's Yosef Tal Hospital with agunshot wound in the neck just where it meets the shoulder,hospital director Haim Shoham said.   About 60 to 70 people are believed to live at Kibbutz Lotan,which grows vegetables and dates.   The last cross-border attack involving hostages was on March 7,1988, when three PLO guerrillas sneaked into southern Israel fromEgypt and hijacked a commuter bus in southern Israel.   They killed three hostages before being shot dead by police. Inaddition, nine Israelis, all workers at a nearby nuclear plant,were shot and wounded.   The Palestine Liberation Organization claimed responsibility forthe attack, which Israeli officials said was aimed at sabotaging anAmerican peace initiative by then-Secretary of State George Shultz.   Two shooting incidents took place along the Jordanian borderearlier this year.   On May 27, a Jordanian soldier and an Israeli patrol exchangedfire across the border near Beit Shean, northeast of Jerusalem. TheJordanian was killed, and two Israeli soldiers were wounded.   In that incident, Jordan radio also reported the Jordaniansoldier had acted on his own after abandoning his post.   On March 17, two gunmen killed an Israeli soldier near Hazeva,23 miles south of the Dead Sea. Jordan later announced it capturedseveral men in the same area.   In Damascus, Syria, the Fatah Uprising group, a rebel offshootof Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction of the PLO, claimedresponsibility for that attack.</TEXT></DOC>
