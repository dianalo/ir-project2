The Defense Agency has decided to retract its demand that morethan 50 percent of engine production work be given to Japan andthat Japan receive all computer software for flight control of theU.S. F-16, which is the basis for the new FSX jet, Asahi Shimbunnewspaper reported.   The Defense Agency chief, Kichiro Tazawa, told reporters todayhe hopes to reach agreement with the United States before PrimeMinister Noboru Takeshita leaves office. Takeshita's announcementTuesday that he will resign soon because of a stock and briberyscandal brought new uncertainty to already troubled plans for theFSX, U.S. officials said.   The Asahi Shimbun newspaper said the director of the DefenseAgency's equipment bureau returned Thursday from talks inWashington, and his agency consulted today with the ForeignMinistry, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and theprime minister's office to work out a unified policy.   The FSX project has been criticized by some U.S. congressmen whocharge it is a giveaway of U.S. technology that Japanese companiescould use to compete with the U.S. aviation industry.   Supporters say the project is a way to add fighters to Japan'sinventory in strategic northeast Asia at Tokyo's expense. It alsowould provide jobs for the United States, and give Washingtonaccess to sophisticated radar technology developed by Japan, theysay.   The Bush administration says it wants clarification of a jointproduction agreement reached last year.   Japan reportedly demanded 50 percent of engine production workin exchange for giving the United States a 40 percent share of theproduction work for the entire aircraft.   The United States reportedly wants assurances any new technologydeveloped from the project will be available to the United States,along with protection for U.S.-developed computer codes that helpfly and control the plane.</TEXT></DOC>
