REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The military officers whose mutinyhelped propel Corazon Aquino to power initially planned to set up aprovisional government and hold new elections to replace FerdinandMarcos as president, a key conspirator said today.   But Navy Capt. Rex Robles said then-Defense Minister Juan PonceEnrile, leader of the mutineers, decided Mrs. Aquino should insteadbe sworn in as president to prevent Marcos from a making legal claimto the office.   Robles made the remarks during an interview on radio station DZRHon the third anniversary of the mutiny, which triggered the popularuprising that drove Marcos from power on Feb. 25, 1986.   U.S. officials first refused to support the mutineers and did soonly after it became clear that Marcos was finished, Robles said.   He said the Reform the Armed Forces Movement had planned tolaunch a coup against Marcos in December 1985 but postponed the moveafter he called a ``snap election'' for Feb. 7, 1986.   ``So we decided to postpone until sometime after elections,around April or May in the summer,'' Robles said. But theconspirators advanced their plans after public outrage over massivecheating in the election, in which both Marcos and Mrs. Aquinoclaimed victory.   ``If we succeeded in ousting Marcos or asking him to step down,our plan was we would set up a transition council, either five toseven members,'' Robles said. ``Our agreement was whoever joined thetransition council would not run in the election which we would holdbecause it would be unfair.''   When it appeared the mutiny would succeed, Robles said civilianand military opponents met to discuss how to establish the legalauthority of a post-Marcos government.   According to Robles, Enrile told the gathering: ``It is necessaryto swear Mrs. Aquino into office right now.'' Several politicianswere shocked by the suggestion.   But Robles said Enrile argued that by swearing in Mrs. Aquinofirst, Marcos ``would have to play catch-up'' and would lack legalauthority.   ``It was Sen. Enrile's idea,'' Robles said. ``They were notprepared (to accept) that concept that you must beat Marcos to thepresidency.''   The National Assembly certified Marcos as the election winnerseveral days before the mutiny, but he had not taken his oath.   Marcos took his oath on Feb. 25, 1986 soon after Mrs. Aquino wassworn in. He fled Manila hours later aboard a U.S. helicopter anddeparted before dawn the next day for exile in Hawaii.   Movement members frequently have complained that they were nevergiven credit for their role in ousting Marcos. The reform movementincluded former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, sought in theviolent August 1987 attempt to topple Mrs. Aquino.   Enrile was fired as defense minister on Nov. 23, 1986, after analleged coup plot by his followers. He was elected as the onlyopposition member of the Senate in May 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
