Many of these businesses serve as intermediaries in tradebetween the United States and Cuba, which has been illegal since1960, the sources said.   The move serves to tighten the embargo against Cuba and also topenalize Panamanian firms controlled by Noriega and his wife, saidthe administration officials, who asked not to be identified.   Americans who violate the new measure, scheduled to be announcednext week, could face fines of up to $500,000, according to theofficials.   The step was first reported by the Los Angeles Times. Askedabout the report, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwilerrefused comment.   The administration has been groping for ways to punish Noriegawithout further damaging the Panamanian economy, which has declinedsteeply over the past 18 months as a result of earlier sanctionsimposed by the United States.   Meanwhile, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez today renewedhis call for the departure of Noriega but said he opposes any U.S.military move to achieve that goal.   Winding up a two-day visit with a news conference, Gonzalezpraised President Bush's decision not to use force in helping rebelofficers in their bid to oust Noriega two weeks ago.   ``Interventionism is never desirable,'' Gonzalez said through atranslator. ``I'm very pleased to know that it has not happened.''   Gonzalez has offered some ideas for resolving Panama's crisisbut he acknowledged that a solution cannot be achieved by thirdcountries.   ``It should be a Panamanian solution; otherwise there will be nosolution,'' he said.   Gonzalez spoke to reporters at Blair House after conferringThursday night with Bush on the Panama situation. Today, he gavefew details of the exchange and declined to characterize Bush'sposition.   Following an earlier meeting, Bush called Spain a model forEastern European nations to follow in their moves toward democraticreforms.   Bush praised Spain's involvement in the European Community andthe 24-nation group that is providing economic assistance to Polandand Hungary. He also noted Spain's own move from dictatorship todemocracy.   Gonzalez's idea for removing Noriega involves electing a newPanamanian president who would have the power to name a newmilitary commander to replace Noriega. In contrast to Bush's statedwish, the proposal would not require that Noriega return to theUnited States to face a drug-trafficking indictment.   Raymond Seitz, assistant secretary of state for European andCanadian Affairs, said the U.S. position has not changed. Asked ifthe administration was flexible, however, he said, ``Sure.''   Privately, another administration official said the primary U.S.goal is to get Noriega out of power, while the secondary goal is totry him on the drug case.   Meanwhile, the Bush administration said Thursday it may speed upthe planned withdrawal of U.S. military dependents from Panama.   Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman, the newly appointed U.S. militarycommander in Panama, also has recommended shortening soldiers' tourof duty so that fewer bring their families to Panama, a Pentagonofficial said.   Bush, Gonzalez and top advisers discussed a range of issues,including economic and political reforms in Poland and Hungary, theupcoming elections in Nicaragua, international anti-drug effortsand their roles in the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance, said Seitz.   Bush had warm words for Spain despite the rough patch inU.S.-Spanish relations that had occurred until last year when theUnited States agreed to reduce its military presence in thesouthern European nation.   Spain insisted that the United States remove a group of F-16fighter planes based in the country. Italy agreed to accept them.   The United States still has a military presence in Spain thatrepresents ``the maturing of the defense relationship'' between thetwo countries, Seitz said.</TEXT></DOC>
