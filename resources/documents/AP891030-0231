Some come because theycan't handle the pressure anymore. We're their last resort,'' saysTennant.   ``Usually, it's a night of crying,'' adds Layton. ``They admittheir secret.''   Gardner was probably past three months in her pregnancy when shehad an abortion at age 17. ``My self-worth was zero,'' she says.``There were six of us in a group at the clinic. I rememberthinking we were like cows.   ``Everyone was crying. I sobbed uncontrollably when they askedme afterward how I felt. I said, `I think I just killed my baby.'But I was so relieved it was over, that I wasn't pregnant anymore.I went on with life.   ``I became real promiscuous, married six months later, had achild right away to make up for it. Then I divorced, went back topromiscuity and got into alcohol and drugs.''   She went on for four years before deciding as a single parentshe had to do something else. She got a real estate license andsold houses figuring it would make her happy and rich and put heraround people who didn't do drugs.   ``This wasn't it either,'' Gardner said. Then she met herhusband. ``He was a Christian. I told him about the abortion and heaccepted me.''   When she was three months pregnant with their child she had asonogram. ``I couldn't believe it. I had never looked at fetaldevelopment. This was the same point at which I had had myabortion. It was a good negative. It was clear. This was a baby.''   Even after she delivered her second child, Gardner said theabortion still troubled her. She talked to a woman at church.   ``I unleashed everything that had happened. Over the past 10years I had been running from this bad person,'' says Gardner, nowa mother of three.   The first night at the center is informal and flexible.   ``We're just there to lead them through it. Sometimes when thehurt is so deep it takes longer,'' says Tennant. ``It takes a lotout of you to deal with people in such a state. Some are suicidal.We've had some who had abortions three weeks earlier and theirbodies haven't even healed yet. Once we had a woman who had aback-alley abortion 30 years ago and was still carrying around theguilt.''   Finally, there is a night for grieving and making peace.   If problems remain, the women are referred to outside counseling.   Out of the Sisters of Rachel grew the crisis pregnancy programwhere they have counseled 70 women this year.   Three women who visited, thinking of having abortions, changedtheir minds. ``Even if one ends positively, it's worth it,'' saysGardner.   ``If they want to look into adoptions, we hook them up with anattorney. If they want to keep the baby but can't afford it, wehelp them find help,'' says Tennant.   While abortions at the Tampa health clinic run between $280 and$850, they can run up to $1,500 for more advanced pregnancies,Rivenbark says.   The Tampa center does abortions up to 17.9 weeks of pregnancy.After that, women are referred to the St. Petersburg center fortwo-day procedures. Rivenbark says doctors won't accept womenfurther along than 20.5 weeks.   A woman is asked if she has considered options and told of thesurgical risk _ from infection to an emergency surgery.   ``If a girl is unsure, or doesn't want the abortion and is beingpushed by a boyfriend or parents, we give referrals,'' Rivenbarksays.   Outside her clinic, a lone picket parades silently on thesidewalk wearing a four-foot sign. It reads: ``Lord Jesus ForgiveOur Nation.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
