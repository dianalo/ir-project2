IMP-ECT was performed in 40 patients with various cerebraldiseases. The following results were obtained: 1. Minimum recognizablecerebral blood flow difference was 5 ml/100 g/min. 2. Quantitative redistributionwas observed in approximately half of the cases which showed qualitativeredistribution. 3. The incidence of crossed cerebellar diaschiasis washigh among patients with significant cerebral disease (8 cases/10 cases).</TEXT></DOC>
