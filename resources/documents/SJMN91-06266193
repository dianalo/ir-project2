Katharine Hepburn is my idol, and every word she writes in&quot;Me: Stories of My Life&quot; raises her higher in my esteem. But even a lessbesotted reader is bound to love this candid and slightly eccentric memoirfilled with anecdote, opinion, gossip and wonderful photographs. Finally,after a lifetime of Yankee reticence, Hepburn lets down her hair.;   TheKatharine Hepburn we encounter in &quot;Me&quot; is less an actress than a force ofnature, ablaze with enthusiasm. &quot;Living itself was a sort of ecstasy,&quot; shewrites of her early career. &quot;The challenges . . . the opportunities!&quot; Heracting, too, sounds incandescent: It was based, she says &quot;on the universalspark.&quot; Especially in auditions, she would &quot;spark the part . . . spark theperson . . . spark the audience. Strike it. Light it.&quot; (And then, as if afraidthat sounds too highfalutin', she adds, &quot;Now I may not have been able to keepa part. But I could get any part.&quot;);   She certainly came by the sparkhonestly. Her mother was a passionate, politically active suffragist --Katharine Hepburn met Emmeline Pankhurst, Margaret Sanger, Rebecca West -- andher father was a genial daredevil who gloried in his daughter's physicalcourage. &quot;Don't give in,&quot; they admonished her. &quot;Fight for your future. Womenare as good as men. Onward!&quot;;   A charmed life;   They expected great thingsof her; her enlightened mother even encouraged her to pursue a career on thestage. &quot;Anything I wanted just so I didn't settle for the old routine ofnursemaid to the rising generation. She thought women should give life awhirl.&quot; (Such a Hepburn expression, that. Not grandiose like &quot;experience lifeto the fullest&quot; or slangy like &quot;give it a shot.&quot; Casual, offhand, well-bred.)Well, she gave life a whirl, and &quot;Me&quot; covers a lot of it.;   She tells usabout her early successes and failures in the theater and about some of her 43pictures. (&quot;Naturally I'm adorable in all of them, but I don't want to killany of you and some of them have a dangerous virus called boredom.&quot;) Sherecounts her affairs with Howard Hughes and Leland Hayward. (Hughes &quot;was thesort of the top of the available men and I of the women. We were a colorfulpair.&quot;) She describes her doomed attempt to rescue Judy Garland from drugs anddespair, her admiration for John Wayne. It's all deft and entertaining andvery generous; she hasn't a harsh word for anyone.;   The person she's hardeston is Katharine Hepburn, but that's no surprise: She always set herself highstandards. Brash and overconfident as a young actress, she recalls that &quot;Icould only imagine myself in the leading parts. This, no doubt, is a commonfailing.&quot;;   She was undeniably and inexcusably callous to Ogden Ludlow, herhusband for 13 years: &quot;What the hell would I have been without Luddy -- myprotector?&quot; she wonders now. &quot;I spent his money, I broke his heart . . . allhe wanted was me, and of course all I wanted was to be a great big star in themovies.&quot; And that, she believes, was her greatest flaw. &quot;People who want to befamous are really loners. Or should be.&quot;;   &quot;Or should be.&quot; But all the worldknows she wasn't a loner for the 27 years she loved and lived with SpencerTracy, in what seems to her fans to be the most romantic liaison of the 20thcentury.;   She has been typically, if maddeningly, mum about it since hisdeath in 1967, and in &quot;Me&quot; she tells all. Eventually. Like the shrewd Yankeebusinesswoman that she is, Hepburn makes us wait until the end of the book forthe details. &quot;You may think you've waited a long time,&quot; she teases, &quot;but let'sface it, so did I. I was thirty-three.&quot;;   Different together;   According toHollywood legend, when Garson Kanin asked Tracy to work with Hepburn on &quot;Womanof the Year&quot; Tracy said, &quot;Oh, really -- do you think we would be goodtogether? We're -- so sort -- of different.&quot; And as Kanin remembers it,Hepburn was dubious too: &quot;Oh -- I don't know. I wonder whether we would begood together. We're so different.&quot;;   They were good together; it was&quot;absolute bliss,&quot; she says. But it's a curious thing that the woman who hadalways called the shots -- with Hughes, with Hayward, with Luddy -- deferredutterly to Tracy in every way. &quot;He didn't like this or that,&quot; she writessimply. &quot;I changed this and that. They might be qualities which I personallyvalued. It did not matter. I changed them.;   &quot;Food -- we ate what he liked.;  &quot;We did what he liked.;   &quot;We lived a life which he liked.;   &quot;This gave megreat pleasure. The thought that this was pleasing him.&quot;;   It's not what Iexpected from this strong-minded woman, but unpredictability is part of hercharm.;   If &quot;Me&quot; has one very minor flaw, it's Hepburn's penchant forsentence fragments. It's just like her not to have a ghostwriter, but shescatters phrases everywhere, and things do get a bit linguistically surreal attimes. &quot;Phelps (an early lover) knew everyone,&quot; she remembers. &quot;I mean, youknow, Robert Benchley, Tony's Speakeasy. Well, Places. You had to know Places,People. You had to be on the In. I've never been any good at that.&quot;;  Eventually, though, even that becomes charming, and you savor such statementsas &quot;I never got very close to anyone in the theatre or movies. I suppose itwas because I was a member of a big family and I always tried to get enoughsleep.&quot;;   That's Hepburn all over. She believes in independence, familyloyalty, elliptical sentences and a good night's sleep. She's 85 now; may shelive forever. (box)  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JOANN C.
