(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It used to be endearing, but the charm hasworn off for many Boulder residents whose backyards and gardenshave become the favorite haunts of increasing numbers of deer.   ``When we started studying the deer in 1982, we thought of themas seasonal and transient, but it seems we have a residentpopulation now, having fawns in people's backyards and sleepingunder decks,'' said Laurie Kuelthau, state Department of Wildlifedistrict manager of southern Boulder County.   About 160 deer were killed by cars last year within Boulder'scity limits, an area of only about 16 square miles.   City Council has received so many complaints of gardens ruinedby hungry deer that it plans to take up the issue Tuesday.   Possible ways to curb the deer range from relocating them tokilling them and donating the venison to food banks. But cityofficials say relocating the deer would cost $400 apiece and couldcause 80 percent mortality.   Mountain lions which normally hunt deer won't thin the deerpopulation because they don't like to hunt so close to humans.   In the past 10 years, the number of deer in the Boulder area hasswelled to double the deer population in the rest of the FrontRange: 50 to 60 per square mile.   Brian Peck, a ranger and naturalist with Boulder Mountain Parks,says the deer population has grown so quickly partly because thecity of about 100,000 people is built on several deer migrationroutes.   In addition, he said, the deer discovered that roses, tulips,raspberries and other plants in suburban gardens are tastier thanmountain mahogany and wild grasses.   Many residents still consider the deer evidence of a rapportwith wildlife in a town with a reputation for environmentalconsciousness. Some people used to put out food and salt licks toattract the deer, but the City Council passed a law in 1985forbidding that.   Kuelthau says most complaints are from gardeners, who in someparts of the city report as many as seven deer in their yards atone time.   In March, Marie Aragon was fined $200 after she killed a deer inher Table Mesa backyard. She said she feared that the deerthreatened her two toddlers, and she disliked cleaning up deerdroppings.   But the deer have their defenders.   A 1987 City Council survey found that 58 percent of thoseresponding wanted the deer to be left alone while 28 percent saidsomething should be done about them.   ``Deer are one of the reasons I like Boulder,'' said KarenMartingale. ``You lose some of your vegetation, but that's one ofthe things you put up with if you live here.''</TEXT></DOC>
