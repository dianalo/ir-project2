Over the weekend, most corn growing regions receivedbetween 3/10 inch and 1 1/4 inches of rain, with temperaturesranging from the 70s to the 80s. These conditions are perfectfor the young corn and soybean crops, and short-term weatherforecasts called for more of the same this week. The onlyexceptions were certain areas in the southern Corn Belt,including parts of southern Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, whichhave been dry.</LP><TEXT>   The mostly favorable weather has produced a healthy cropthroughout the heart of the Corn Belt, analysts said. &quot;Thecrop really looks good across most of the Midwest,&quot; saidDaniel Basse, director of market research for AgResource Co.,Chicago.   Allendale Inc., a research company based in Crystal Lake,Ill., reported in its first 1991 yield survey yesterday thatthe corn crop appeared to be of above average quality inIllinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, North Dakota, Nebraskaand South Dakota. Below average corn yields were reported insix other states, including Iowa, where wet weather delayedplanting.   State crop ratings released by the U.S. AgricultureDepartment after the end of trading yesterday estimated that78% of the nation's corn crop is in good to excellentcondition, compared with 63% at this time last year. Thoughhigher than the year-earlier estimate, the percentage ofgood-to-excellent corn was down slightly from last week's81%, which may offset any continued downward pressure onfutures prices in trading today.   The market was also trading on weather-related factors insoybean futures.   State crop ratings yesterday estimated the soybean crop is9% excellent in quality, compared with 4% at this time a yearago, and 59% good, compared with 54% a year ago. In addition,states such as Iowa and Minnesota reported large increases inpercentages of the soybean crop already planted, despiterainy conditions that some analysts thought would inhibitplanting last week. Minnesota, in particular, was reported85% planted yesterday, compared with 68% last week.   Analysts said traders share a general perception thatfarmers whose hard red winter wheat crops were hurt bydisease in the southern Midwest may grow soybeans to try torecover some of the lost wheat profits. Any such increase inplanting would be expected to exert downward pressure onfutures prices.   There was widespread selling of new crop futures,producing new contract lows in soybean oil, soybean and oatfutures contracts. The selling combined with the favorableweather forecasts to help push prices down for practicallyall grain futures prices.   The price of the corn contract for December deliverydeclined 4.25 cents yesterday to settle at $2.3775 a bushel;the July soybean contract fell five cents to $5.625 a bushel;and the July wheat contract dropped 3.50 cents to $2.895 abushel.   Traders still are awaiting final announcement of a newcredit allocation for grain purchases by the Soviet Union,which is expected by tomorrow. But analysts said the grainmarket already has factored the expected credit package intofutures prices.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices strengthened on continuing concernsof supply availability. Sugar for July delivery ended 0.34cent a pound higher at 9.58 cents. October sugar rose 0.44cent to 8.73 cents. Seeing forecasts of a large surplus insugar production this year, traders had been bearish towardthe sugar market in recent weeks, a trader said. &quot;But infact, there isn't that much sugar out there,&quot; the tradersaid, and investors who had bet the price would fall havebeen scrambling to buy offsetting contracts. Contributing tothe tightness are mechanical problems in Cuba that areslowing shipments, traders say. The volcanic eruption in thePhilippines will diminish sugar supplies, some traders say,but others dismiss the talk, noting that the Philippinesisn't a big sugar exporter. Weather is also becoming aconcern in sugar-growing countries, said Jim Roemer,meteorologist at Freese Notis Weather in Des Moines, Iowa.France has suffered from a drought until recently, while coolweather has slowed the sugar beet crop's growth in EasternEurope by at least 10 to 14 days, Mr. Roemer said.Southeastern China has received less than half its normalrainfall in the past two months, he added.   ENERGY: Petroleum futures were higher in sluggish andtechnically oriented trading. But crude oil failed to holdabove the psychologically important level of $20 a barrel.Crude for July delivery reached $20.10 a barrel during theafternoon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. But it thenfell back to settle at $19.94, up 27 cents from Friday'sclose. August crude rose 18 cents to $19.98 a barrel.Gasoline futures also were relatively firm, with the Julycontract up 0.45 cent a gallon to 62.97 cents. Augustgasoline increased 0.48 cent a gallon to 61.45 cents.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose. Gold for Augustdelivery finished $1 an ounce higher at $370.80. July silverrose 1.8 cents an ounce to $4.445. Separately, some goldoptions traders were left in the dark yesterday morning by asoftware &quot;glitch&quot; in the processing system of the CommodityExchange's clearing affiliate. The system failed to processcertain gold options, leaving holders of these options, whichexpired Friday, uncertain about their positions yesterdaymorning. The financial damage was limited, traders say,because the market was relatively quiet yesterday. Thegreater damage was to the Comex's reputation, traders said.&quot;It certainly causes a loss of confidence in the exchange,&quot;said Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader at Chase ManhattanBank, which wasn't hurt by the Comex's problem. A Comexspokesman called the failure &quot;an isolated problem.&quot; He added,&quot;Overall, our record is fantastic. We get high marks forclearing.&quot; In a Futures Industry Association survey of 21futures commission merchants earlier this year, the Comex wasconsidered the best among the New York futures exchanges inits clearing operations.</TEXT></DOC>
