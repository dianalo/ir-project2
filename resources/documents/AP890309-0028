Thousands of students turned out for rallies and marches in atleast six cities Wednesday. Some disturbances were reported, but therallies still were in sharp contrast to the March 1968 events theycommemorated.   Contributing to the calm mood was the announcement Tuesday thatSolidarity chairman Lech Walesa had won government agreement tolegalize the Independent Students Association, or NZS, after aseven-year ban.   In Warsaw, police on Wednesday helped direct traffic around twoseparate demonstrations held with the permission of municipalofficials.   More than 5,000 young people _ led by a woman pushing twins in ababy carriage _ marched through the capital's downtown streets. Themarchers chanted, ``No success without NZS!''   An evening march later drew about 2,000 people.   At Jagiellonian University in Krakow in southern Poland, 3,000students listened to an address by opposition activist Adam Michnik,a veteran of the 1968 protest. ``It's a moving day for me becausewhat happened 21 years ago changed my generation and my life,'' hetold the students.   The students heeded an appeal from the university rector andstayed on the campus, avoiding a confrontation with police.   About 1,000 people gathered at the Polytechnic Institute inWroclaw, in southwestern Poland, said local opposition activistJozef Pinior.   He said that later, a few hundred youths began marching andcarrying banners of the radical splinter group Fighting Solidarity.Pinior said police allowed them to walk a mile or so before stoppingthe demonstration.   Sixteen people were briefly detained, he said.   When the evening march ended in Warsaw, 50 to 100 youths fromFighting Solidarity and the RSA, an anarchist movement, held theirown march for several blocks before riot police blocked their path.   Someone in the crowd threw a smokebomb at police, and a fewothers threw stones before the crowd melted away.   The official PAP news agency reported peaceful rallies in Poznan,Lublin and Olsztyn.   On March 8, 1968, police and Communist Party worker-activistsinvaded Warsaw University's campus and attacked students protestingthe expulsion of Michnik and another student, who had spoken outagainst closure of a performance of Adam Mickiewicz's patriotic play``Forefather's Eve.''   The episode and subsequent clashes between students and policeradicalized many young people who later became leading figures inthe Solidarity free trade union movement. It also provided a pretextfor an anti-Semitic, anti-intellectual purge that caused thousandsof people to lose jobs in an internal party power struggle.   ``The March (1968) events ... make us aware of a certain greattruth _ how pitifully ineffective are the efforts of all those whostand against the natural and inborn wish for freedom,'' WarsawUniversity rector Grzegorz Bialkowski told the students before theymarched to a monument to Mickiewicz.</TEXT></DOC>
