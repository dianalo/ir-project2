These laws purported tolimit some types of U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. Arelated &quot;Rule of Law&quot; column appears today.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   In those early days I assumed the {Office of IndependentCounsel} was, more or less, just one big happy family, unitedon the goals and methods for our investigation. I was,however, promptly jolted out of this misconception when Iheard Danny Coulson, the chief FBI agent assigned to Walsh'steam, muttering after an early staff meeting. &quot;The Bolandamendment?&quot; he said, &quot;the Boland amendment? What the hellkind of crime is that?&quot;   Coulson's grumbling was my first clue of a deep splitwithin the OIC. A criminal charge based on the Bolandamendment divided us not by political inclination but byprofessional background. By and large, the professional civillitigators and full-time defense lawyers wanted to bring theBoland case. The experienced prosecutors did not.   Like Coulson, the experienced prosecutors -- Bob Shwartzand Paul Friedman, among others -- believed the office shouldselect discrete criminal acts for prosecution rather thancharge, in essence, one big, stinking mess. Charge crimes,they urged -- lying, cheating, stealing -- not policydisputes.   The Boland opponents within our office sought to make alarger point. Even if we could convince ourselves that Bolandapplied to North and that he made specific, forbiddenexpenditures, this was a criminal case we were talking about.   Was a Boland charge too technical? Did it belong in acriminal court? Were we abusing our power? One office witsummed up the concerns well when he promised us that we wouldnever hear the cry: &quot;Officer, arrest that man -- he'sviolating the Boland amendment]&quot;   Chris Todd began wondering out loud how a Boland chargewould play to a jury. He was not worried about legaltechnicalities, but Boland's effect in the courtroom. &quot;Whatis the theory that we can put in a box?&quot; he asked. &quot;Peopleout there don't know or care about the Boland amendment. Howcan we make this charge sound criminal in laymen's terms?&quot;   To the surprise of {trial lawyer John} Keker, and mosteveryone else, it was {Lawrence} Walsh who jumped in andmounted a vigorous defense of the charge. &quot;My concept is thatthere was a CIA activity going on in 1984,&quot; he said.&quot;Congress wanted to stop it. Notwithstanding that, {Oliver}North said `we're not going to let that stop us' and moved itover to the NSC.&quot;   &quot;Yes,&quot; Todd said, &quot;that's a violation of what Congressintended, but that's not what Congress said. I think whatNorth did was within the letter of the law, and not aviolation of criminal law. I see it as morally wrong. But wasit criminal? No.   &quot;So you admit that Congress tried to forbid it?&quot; Walshasked.   &quot;Yes,&quot; Todd answered, &quot;they hoped to forbid it.&quot;   &quot;So,&quot; Walsh pressed on, &quot;did North violate what Congresssaid or avoid it?&quot;   &quot;It's the distinction between tax avoidance and taxevasion,&quot; Todd replied, &quot;and the law has never preventedclever lawyers from finding ways of tax avoidance for theirclients.&quot;   Still, Walsh would not move. &quot;Any time I've gotten introuble in litigation is when I've not been ready to assertthe central core position. We're going to get in trouble ifwe just pick our `can't lose' issues. When I know I'm rightmorally -- and have a tough time legally -- that's alwaysbetter.&quot;   Late in January, Walsh called the staff together toconsider the first count in the case -- the charge ofconspiracy to violate the Boland amendment. Just what wascriminal about North's efforts on behalf of the contras?   Bob Shwartz had a simple answer: nothing. &quot;These peopleacted in what they thought was a good-faith belief that theywere doing what they were supposed to do,&quot; he said.   &quot;What we're talking about is running a war off the books,&quot;{deputy IC Guy} Struve said. &quot;That's criminal.&quot;   &quot;We have to balance what the facts and law permit with asense of fairness,&quot; Shwartz answered. &quot;Charging a violationof the Boland amendment is not fair.&quot;   ---   David Zornow invited the legal staff to his in-laws' homein the Maryland suburbs. We mostly sat by the pool andpondered our fate, but there was also one item on the agendafor the afternoon. Several months earlier, Zornow hadsuggested to Walsh that the office arrange for a groupphotograph to provide us with a memento of our service on thecase -- and offer a rare stroke to staff morale. Aphotographer was retained and a date selected -- and thendoubts crept in.   Our office had been repeatedly criticized in the press(particularly on The Wall Street Journal editorial page) andin our defendants' briefs for our &quot;unlimited&quot; staff andbudget. A staff picture would surely have to include all ofour growing group of alumni lawyers and our sizable corps ofpart-timers. Adding them to our core group of about 20lawyers would mean a very large group photo. What if, Walshwondered, the photograph fell into &quot;the wrong hands?&quot; Hedecided it was not worth the risk. The staff photo wascanceled.   The official photo, that is. In the dimming twilight of abeer-soaked summer afternoon in Chevy Chase, Bruce Yannett'scamera snapped a bedraggled group portrait. Perhaps, wethought at that grim juncture, this might be all we had toshow for our efforts.   ---   My initial ambitions for the job were more those of anadolescent than a prosecutor. Prosecutors thinking broadlyput all of us at peril. To expand the criminal law intoanything less fundamental than enforcement of specificstatutes -- into the realms of honest disagreements, policytussles, and close calls -- jeopardizes the whole edifice ofthe law.   We had not prosecuted anyone for the diversion of funds tothe contras, but eventually I had to ask myself: was thediversion a crime at all? The diversion was clearly wrong,and those who made it happen should certainly have been firedand condemned. But one can say all those things and stillbelieve that those people did not commit a crime.   ---   From OPENING ARGUMENTS by Jeffrey Toobin 1991 JeffreyToobin.
