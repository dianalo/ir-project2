Gorbachevsaid Thursday that Moscow will cut its nuclear forces in the BalticSea and will destroy four aging submarines and the nuclear missilesthey carry.   Gorbachev also said the Soviet Union has removed all tacticalnuclear missiles that could strike the northern European region andwill take certain types of sea-launched nuclear weapons out of theBaltic Sea.   In a 45-minute speech to Finnish business leaders, politiciansand other guests on the second day of a three-day visit to Finland,Gorbachev repeated his hope to eliminate nuclear weapons from the148,600-square-mile Baltic Sea.   ``We are prepared to come to agreement with all the nuclearpowers and the Baltic states on effective guarantees for thenuclear-free status of the Baltic Sea,'' he said in a nationallybroadcast speech in Helsinki's Finlandia Hall.   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union was taking the stepsunilaterally, dropping previous conditions that Western countriesfirst agree to a nuclear-free zone.   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwatersaid, ``We do not believe nuclear-free zones contribute to securityin Europe.   ``Most of these proposals have been designed to affect NATOdeterrence capability while leaving Soviet nuclear weaponsintact,'' Fitzwater said. ``On the other hand, we do appreciate theintent of this and if it can develop into something concrete, why,that might be a hopeful sign.''   Later, Fitzwater revised his remarks, saying, ``In fact we donot consider this a hopeful sign.''   Gorbachev said the steps were a follow-up to a speech he gavetwo years ago in the Soviet Union's northern port of Murmansk, inwhich he first proposed a nuclear-free zone in northern Europe. TwoNATO countries in the region, Norway and Denmark, do not permitnuclear weapons in their territory in peacetime.   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union already has taken two of its sixGolf-class submarines out of operation from the Baltic Sea andpledged to destroy the remaining four by the end of next year.   In his Murmansk speech, Gorbachev had offered to removenuclear-armed subs from the Baltic Sea and Soviet officials offeredto withdraw the remaining four only if countries of the regionagreed ``on a non-nuclear North.''   On Thursday, he dropped that requirement.   ``The Soviet Union started by removing from operational statustwo Golf-class submarines and before the end of 1990 it willdestroy the four remaining submarines of the same class. We willalso destroy their standard nuclear missile payloads and we have noplans for their replacement,'' he said.   Six Golf II subs, 321 feet long with a displacement of 2,950tons, have been deployed in the Baltic Sea since 1976, according tothe British reference book Jane's Fighting Ships. The Soviets havesaid the subs carried 18 ballistic missiles.   The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute hasdescribed the Golf II as obsolete and predicted they would beremoved from service because they are of limited value.   Gorbachev did not specify which types of sea-launched nuclearweapons the Soviets would remove from the sea.   The United States has expressed concern that removal of thesea-launched missiles cannot be verified, and it has balked attheir inclusion in a superpower arms pact being negotiated inGeneva.   Finnish officials welcomed Gorbachev's announcements, and theyalso are likely to please grassroots political groups in the Balticrepublics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania that have urged theKremlin to remove nuclear weapons from the region.   In another announcement, Gorbachev said the Kremlin has agreedto Norway's proposal to negotiate mutual notification of accidentsinvolving ships, including nuclear-powered submarines.   Three Soviet nuclear-powered submarines have been involved inaccidents since April in the Barents and Norwegian seas.   In other comments, Gorbachev:   _ Reversed decades of ``Finlandization'' _ pressure on Finlandto toe the Kremlin line _ by saying to applause, ``The Soviet Unionunreservedly recognizes Finland's neutral status.''   _ Proposed that the next follow-up meeting to the 1975 HelsinkiAccords, which outlined East-West security measures, cooperation ineconomic and scientific and human rights affairs, be held in 1992in Helsinki and be attended by leaders of the 35 states involved.   _ Paved the way for direct contacts between legislators in theSoviet Baltic republics and Scandinavian countries grouped in theNordic Council.   Gorbachev, seeking Finnish help in modernizing the Sovieteconomy, met with industrialists and reviewed Finnish developmentsin a range of industries from forestry to clothing for seamen onicebreakers or arctic construction workers. Many of the companiesrepresented at the meeting already have joint projects with theSoviets, but Gorbachev said there should be more.   He showed special interest in pollution-monitoring equipment formining and metallurgy and asked how much they would add to costs.He made clear he had in mind Soviet industries in the KolaPeninsula bordering Finland.   ``I've been there. I've seen it with my own eyes,'' he said ofthe pollution. ``The target should be higher.''</TEXT></DOC>
