(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Miss New Hampshire, Jennifer AnnLandry, had to wake up at 3:45 a.m. and endure a bumpy flight to bethe first candidate to arrive Tuesday for the Miss America Pageant.   ``I'm honored to be the first one,'' Ms. Landry, 22, said about9:30 a.m. after descending the steps from a small commuter plane atBader Field.   As her 10 pieces of luggage were packed into a car trunk, Ms.Landry pulled out a small, white teddy bear which she said was agood-luck charm given to her by the daughter of the New Hampshirepageant director.   The 5-foot-6 blonde, blue-eyed contestant also received what sheconsidered an unsolicited boost from the pilot of her plane.   ``He mistook me for Miss America,'' Ms. Landry said. But sheadded that her real talisman will be the 100 friends and relativesshe expects to come to watch her compete.   All 51 contestants arriving Tuesday will rehearse and make aseries of public appearances. Beginning Sept. 12, they compete inpreliminary competition leading to the 69-year-old pageant'snationally televised finals Sept. 16.   ``Greeters'' from the pageant limited reporters' questionsbecause ``sometimes the girls will run off at the mouth a little,''said Millie Frambes, one of the four greeters for Ms. Landry.   However, Ms. Landry seemed eager to answer questions, saying herplane ride was a ``little bumpy,'' and telling reporters of herpre-dawn rise.   Ms. Landry is a University of New Hampshire student majoring inchild care-special education.   In a new twist this year, each contestant has submitted an essayon an issue of her choice, Horn said. If she wins the crown, shewill be able to promote that issue during her reign, he said.   The new Miss America will succeed Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson ofMinnesota.</TEXT></DOC>
