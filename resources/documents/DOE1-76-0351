Their operation, status, and applications are evaluated, showingthat their near term roles are complementary to kinetic energy weapons.In addition, particle beams are shown to be the primary candidates forinterrogating space objects, discriminating numerous light decoys possiblein midcourse, and eliminating reentry vehicles among them.</TEXT></DOC>
