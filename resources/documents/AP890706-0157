The department also said the only way to find effectiveverification methods for the presence of nuclear warheads onsea-launched missiles was through government-to-government effortsand not by private organizations.   The joint experiment was conducted Wednesday by the SovietAcademy of Sciences, a state-sponsored body, and by the NaturalResources Defense Council, a Washington environmental-advocacyorganization.   The experiment sought to address claims by Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev that the presence of nuclear weapons aboardships and submarines can be effectively verified.   Deputy Soviet Foreign Minister Viktor Karpov said after the trialthat ``this method is regarded by the U.S.S.R. to be useful atcreating a comprehensive system for verification.''   Karpov, speaking on the evening television news program Vremya,agreed other means were necessary in any verification system andsaid he hoped the experiment would lead to further cooperative workon the subject by American and Soviet scientists.   The United States has treated the Soviet claims very cautiously,saying effective verification continues to be one of the mostdifficult obstacles on the way of concluding the Strategic ArmsReduction Treaty, which would cut superpower atomic arsenals by 30percent to 50 percent.   Negotiations on a START agreement resumed last month in Geneva,but the United States, citing problems of verification, has rejectedthe Soviet demand that the pact include a curb on nuclear-tippedcruise missiles aboard submarines.   U.S. Navy officers say they will not allow Soviets aboardAmerican submarines to conduct the intrusive inspections needed todetermine whether a cruise missile is carrying a conventional ornuclear warhead.   In the Black Sea experiment, the scientists used a variety ofradiation-detection devices to measure the emission of neutrons andgamma rays from a nuclear wearhead on an SS-N-12 subsonic cruisemissile aboard the Soviet missile cruiser Slava.   The U.S. scientists, from Princeton and Stanford universities,made their measurements with portable detectors placed alongside thedeck launcher, less than a yard from the warhead.   Simultaneously, Soviet scientists from the academy's institutesof geochemistry and earth physics used radiation-detection devicescarried in a military helicopter and a troop transport.   But deputy State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said theoperation was not conducted ``under operational conditions. It doesnot take into account the possibility that the effectiveness ofradiation-detection equipment could be undermined or circumvented byshielding, concealment or other counter-measures.''   Boucher said the experiment ``could create unwarrantedexpectations'' on the part of the Soviet Union at the START talks.He noted that the American physicists had also conceded theirexperiment would not provide full-proof verification againstcheating.   ``Despite our extensive efforts,'' the State Department spokesmansaid, the United States ``has not yet found ways to effectivelyverify limits on nuclear-armed, sea-launched cruise missiles. Webelieve that issues such as SLCM (Sea-Launched Cruise Missiles)verification can be dealt with effectively only in agovernment-to-government context.''   But Tom Cochran, one of the physicists, said ``all the systemstested successfully'' during the measurments.   Among the observers on the Soviet carrier were three Demcoraticmembers of the House. They are Reps. John Spratt, a member of theHouse Armed Services Committee from South Carolina; Bob Carr, fromMichigan, and James Olin, of Virginia.</TEXT></DOC>
