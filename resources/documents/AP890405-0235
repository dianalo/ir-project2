They called themselves Gay Men's Health Crisis. They had littlemoney and less clout; there was no name for the disease thatbrought them together.   Today, Gay Men's Health Crisis has a $10 million budget, its ownsix-story Manhattan building and 2,000 volunteers, and the diseasehas a name: acquired immune deficiency syndrome.   After years of hectoring politicians and public health officialsto address the problems of people with AIDS, GMHC and its cohortsare themselves being challenged to cope with the changing face ofthat population.   Nationwide, more than 87,000 cases of AIDS have been reported,about two-thirds of them among homosexual or bisexual men. But inmany cities, especially along the East Coast, someone diagnosedwith AIDS today is about as likely to have become infected byshooting up with dirty needles as through sex.   In New York City, intravenous drug abusers comprised anestimated 45 percent of all newly reported AIDS cases last year.``These projections bear out what we have long known, that thespread of AIDS is fueled by drugs (and) that AIDS is acceleratingits onslaught upon poor, drug-ravaged neighborhoods and minoritycommunities,'' said city Health Commissioner Stephen Joseph.   In New Jersey, IV drug abusers comprised 59 percent of new AIDScases.   What this means to AIDS-service providers is only now beingaddressed.   San Francisco, with the most people with AIDS per capita of anyU.S. city, wins praise from all quarters for its response to theepidemic.   Its Shanti Project, a peer-counseling group for the terminallyill, had one staffer in 1982 and was nearly defunct. Now it has a$3 million budget and a paid staff of 70, directing counselinggroups and a housing program geared toward independent living forpeople with AIDS.   But Greg Day, Shanti's education director, notes that about 96percent of AIDS cases in the city are among gay males ``who used tolead relatively normal lives,'' were employed full time and have afirmer footing in society.   ``I think that because the impact of AIDS has been primarily,overwhelmingly, on the gay community thus far, we have succeeded sofar in developing our resources along with the epidemic,'' he said.``We don't have the answers yet on how to best serve the IVdrug-user population.''   The situation is similar in Los Angeles, Seattle, Minneapolis,and other cities where the number of IV drug users is relativelysmall, experts say.   In Chicago, things are more difficult.   ``What we're dealing with here in Chicago, particularly whenwe're dealing with the issue of homelessness and destitution, isnot the gay community, but blacks, minorities, IV drug users,prostitutes and their families _ people of the streets basically,''said Al Mascia of Travelers and Immigrants Aid, a private groupthat helps house homeless people with AIDS.   ``While we want to adopt some of the programs or utilize some ofthe models that San Francisco has, we're talking about working witha different population for the most part,'' Mascia said.   Part of the problem is that an IV drug user does notautomatically kick the habit when diagnosed with AIDS. But mostAIDS organizations require infected drug abusers to enter treatmentbefore they are accepted as clients.   ``It's fine for us to deal with you as someone with ARC(AIDS-related condition) or AIDS,'' said Tim Sweeney, GMHC deputydirector for policy. ``But the truth is if you're just leaving ourfront door and going out and sticking another needle in your arm,we're really not doing you any big favor.   ``You've got two illnesses to be dealt with.''   Programs such as GMHC and the Shanti Project depend onvolunteers, but Sweeney said, ``We are finding now that ... thevolunteer model really doesn't work with them. They need much moredirect, intense case management, much more involvement, usually bya professional staff person to help them set up the structure oftheir life, so that they're independent.''   The drug abuser also is more likely to be homeless, yet sheltersare no place for someone infected with AIDS. Several cities runapartments for people with AIDS capable of independent living, butdemand far outstrips supply.   People with AIDS who no longer need hospitalization but have noplace to go often are sent to single-room-occupancy hotels, wherethey have no medical supervision and must contend with seedysurroundings and crime.   Many are ``discharged from the hospital and can sit on the benchout front,'' said Larry Ellis of Lifelink, a Washington-based AIDSorganization.   In New York, a lucky few find room in the highly praised,privately run Bailey House, the city's only supervised AIDSresidence. It opened in 1986 with rooms for 44 people and hopes toadd nine more rooms by the summer of 1990.   For Lawrence Conklin, 38, a 20-year heroin and cocaine addictdiagnosed with AIDS about two years ago, a clean, nicely furnishedroom at Bailey House and a treatment program ``was the only thingthat saved me.''
