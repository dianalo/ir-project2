In the municipal market, prices of Bridgeport, Conn.,bonds were little changed even though a federal judgerejected the city's closely watched bid to file forprotection under federal bankruptcy laws. One trader quoteduninsured Bridgeport general obligation bonds due 2009 at ayield of about 8.25%, unchanged from Wednesday.   Trading has been very light in Bridgeport bonds all week,partly because many traders had expected the judge to rejectthe city's petition. Bridgeport officials previously had saidthey planned to continue making all debt payments on timeeven if their bankruptcy petition was granted.   Treasury bond prices began slumping early in the day aftertwo economic reports were released. However, long-termgovernment bond prices staged a mild rally late in the day,trimming their losses for the session, after the FederalReserve reported unexpectedly weak money-supply figuresduring the latest week. If money growth doesn't acceleratesoon and if the economy shows signs of slipping, the Fed maycut short-term interest rates, several investment managerssay.   Trading was sluggish throughout the day as investorsawaited this morning's unemployment report from the LaborDepartment. That report could play a major role in thethinking of Fed officials in setting credit policy. Thereport, which often contains major surprises, generally isexpected to provide further evidence of the economy's gradualrecovery, but some economists fear the economy still isdangerously weak.   Analysts anticipate the report will show an increase inbusiness payrolls of about 60,000 last month, compared with a50,000 decline reported for June. The civilian unemploymentrate probably remained unchanged at 7%, according to theaverage estimate of analysts surveyed by Dow Jones CapitalMarkets Report.   Traders blamed part of yesterday's mild bond-marketsetback on the government's huge borrowing needs. TheTreasury will sell a record $38 billion of notes and bondsnext week in a three-part quarterly refinancing operation.Bond prices often slump right around these quarterlyextravaganzas.
