The abilityto identify localised areas where precipitation has concentrated depositionis emphasized. It is made clear that {gamma} detectors tend to be dominatedby local levels of deposited activity and are inadequate to define whenradioactivity is passing overhead. Facilities for airborne monitoringare recommended.</TEXT></DOC>
