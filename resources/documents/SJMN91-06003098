The paper's contracts with thoseunions expired on Dec. 31, and while they are supposed to stay in effect whilenew pacts are being negotiated, Maynard told the unions he can't afford toadhere to the contracts.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  OAKLAND NEWSPAPER SEEKS 11% PAY CUTTRIBUNE IS BEHIND ON SOME PAYMENTS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     At the same meeting, Maynard told the unions for the first time that he iswilling to share ownership or power at the Tribune, leaving the door openeither to an outright sale of the paper or to a union-based purchase ofTribune stock.
