In this major vegetable-growing valley, some 200,000 men, women and children live and work under a chemical veil whose toxic effects are heightened by poor sanitary conditions.    Local Mexican health authorities say that cases of pesticide poisonings, respiratory disorders and leukemia appear high among area farm workers. Efforts by U.S. chemical producers and activists to reduce the danger by improving pesticide labeling seem hollow since illiteracy is rampant.    In Culiacan's fields, laborers spray chemicals without the protective masks or gloves that are recommended on pesticidecan labels. Mario Perez, the manager of a local packing-house, says that workers reject such gear because it is hot and cumbersome. &quot;Mexicans aren't very disciplined,&quot; Mr. Perez says. But several fieldworkers say that they didn't know about such equipment.    Pesticides also rain down on workers and their families from the sky. &quot;The big problem down here comes from aerial spraying,&quot; says Jesus Morales, the head of health services for the Mexican state of Sinaloa. Dr. Morales believes that airborne chemical vapors in this valley trigger severe respiratory infections among migrant farm workers. Such cases often develop into rheumatic fever, which can cause permanent heart damage, he says.    Cases of leukemia also run high among the children of area farm workers, although a link between such childhood cancers and chemical exposure still hasn't been made, says another local doctor.    Sanitary conditions compound the chemical hazards. Campamento San Jose, set in the midst of vegetable fields, is a typical Culiacan labor camp. Some 2,000 workers and their families live here in soot-covered tin huts. Children play volleyball using a strand of barbed wire as a net. Nearby, open latrines empty into an irrigation ditch. Several hundred feet away, other workers bathe in the same ditch and drink the water.    Many pesticide experts note that few Third World farm workers are trained to appreciate chemical hazards. &quot;In South America people refer to pesticide as 'plant medicine' and they don't think medicine is dangerous,&quot; says Agi Kiss, a pesticides expert with the World Bank in Washington. In Culiacan and other Third World farming regions, discarded plastic pesticide containers frequently serve as water buckets. Some 20 revelers at a wedding in India recently died after drinking punch mixed in used pesticide containers, Ms. Kiss says.    There are an estimated 500,000 pesticide-poisoning cases each year world-wide. John E. Davies, writing in this week's New England Journal of Medicine, reports that nearly 1,000 pesticide-related deaths occur annually in the tiny nation of Sri Lanka alone. Dr. Davies, a pesticides expert at the University of Miami, estimates that 25% of these deaths are occupationally related, with suicides accounting for the rest. (People in developing countries often use pesticides to kill themselves because the chemicals are cheap and readily available.)    The government of Guyana recently banned the import of thallium sulphate, a rat poison, following a spate of pesticide-related deaths there. The Lancet, a British medical journal, reported earlier this month that local farmers had used the rat poison as a fertilizer, contaminating crops.    International efforts to find quick fixes to such problems have run into roadblocks. In 1983, for example, U.S. environmental activists and the National Agricultural Chemicals Association, a Washington-based trade group, negotiated guidelines to improve warnings on pesticide-can labels. The coalition tried to fashion a warning system based on symbols intelligible to illiterates, says Barbara Bramble, a National Wildlife Federation official who worked on the project.    But cross-cultural glitches grounded the project. While the skull-and-crossbones symbol signals danger to Westerners, the image is the trademark of a brand of highly toxic pesticides in Southeast Asia. Another problem: The color red, another common danger sign, is perceived by the Chinese as a symbol of happiness.    &quot;Someone suggested using a dead bug with its feet in the air as a warning sign,&quot; Ms. Bramble says, but then people might have thought it was a really good pesticide.    As a result, activists and chemical company officials have shifted their focus from labeling practices to improving the way foreign governments regulate pesticides. </TEXT></DOC>
