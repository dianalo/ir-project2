Less than two months after the rebels signed a temporarycease-fire agreement with Nicaragua's leftist government,administration analysts on Central America say the Contras' futureseems bleak for a variety of reasons:   _Up to 3,000 rebels, denied delivery of U.S. humanitarian aidshipments, have fled across the Nicaraguan border into Honduras insearch of food.   _Serious rifts have emerged in the Contra ranks. An undeterminednumber of rebels mutinied recently against military commanderEnrique Bermudez at a Contra camp in southern Honduras. Bermudezalso faces opposition from at least two members of the rebelpolitical directorate.   _If fighting resumes after the current cease fire ends on June1, the Contras have enough military supplies to last only one totwo months. Congress rejected President Reagan's military aidrequest on Feb. 3 and there is little support at present for areversal of that decision.   _Soviet military supplies are continuing to flow to theSandinistas at a rate slightly ahead of the 1987 pace. According toU.S. estimates, Soviet military deliveries totaled $105 million forthe first three months of 1988.   ``The Contras seem to be in the process of disintegrating,''said one official, insisting on anonymity. ``The consolidation ofSandinista rule is upon us.''   The official said all of the predictions he and some others inthe administration had made in February after the congressionalrejection of Contra aid are being borne out.   Specifically, he said the aid vote has contributed to increasingright-left political polarization in Guatemala, reflected in afailed military coup attempt there last week, and in El Salvador,where the rightist ARENA party won impressively in nationalelections in March, the official said.   He added that the prospective demise of the U.S.-backed rebelsin Nicaragua has had the effect of ``emboldening'' leftistguerrillas in El Salvador who are aligned with the Sandinistas.   These views, however, are not universally shared in theadministration. Another official, also speaking privately, said thetrends in Guatemala and El Salvador are the result of internaldevelopments unrelated to the situation in Nicaragua.   The prevailing view among more conservative members of theadministration is that consolidation of Sandinista rule wouldgenerate nervousness in neighboring countries, forcing them toshift priorities from democratic development to concerns overinternal security.   If military coups occur, Congress would retaliate by drasticallyreducing assistance, creating both economic hardship and increasingsympathy for leftist rebels, according to this scenario.   The Contras and the Sandinistas signed a temporary truce inSapoa, Nicaragua, on March 23. They agreed to try to negotiate apermanent cease-fire during a 60-day period starting April 1.   With the deadline for reaching agreement on formally endingtheir six-year war just two weeks away, there has been virtually noprogress toward that objective.   Disputes between the Sandinistas and the Contras have preventeddelivery of U.S. humanitarian aid to the rebels inside Nicaragua,leaving the administration with no option but to try to send themcash via couriers.   If no final agreement is reached by the June 1 deadline, theContras have two obvious alternatives available to them, neithervery promising, the officials said.   As one official described it, the Contras could resume the warand face defeat against superior Sandinista firepower. Or theycould reach agreement with the Sandinistas on a truce extension,enabling the Sandinistas to maintain slow-pace negotiations inhopes that total demoralization of the rebels eventually would setin.   If the Sandinistas decide to resume the war, this would winrenewed sympathy for the rebels in the U.S. Congress but theContras also could be confronted with what one official said wasthe possibility of a quick ``knockout blow.''   In that case, he said, ``if the Congress decides to approve moreaid, there would be no one to give the aid to.''</TEXT></DOC>
