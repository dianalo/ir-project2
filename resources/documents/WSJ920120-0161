IBM said that mainframe sales did well in the quarter,matching the record set in the 1990 fourth quarter and thatthe backlog of orders for a new generation of machines wassolid for the first quarter. IBM, Armonk, N.Y., also said itcut costs faster than expected, eliminating 29,000 of the374,000 jobs it had at the beginning of 1991, far exceedingthe 20,000 it had said it would cut. IBM, which had said itwould cut 20,000 additional jobs this year, said it stillwill eliminate 15,000 to 20,000 despite getting far morepeople than expected to take buy-out packages in 1991.</LP><TEXT>   Beyond the first quarter, the outlook is fuzzy, especiallyfor the all-important mainframes, so IBM's prospects appearto hinge on what happens with the world-wide economy. In aconference call with securities analysts, &quot;IBM wouldn'tcommit to double-digit mainframe growth,&quot; said Dan Benton, ananalyst with Goldman Sachs. &quot;And when's the last time theydidn't have double-digit revenue growth in the first year ofa new mainframe product line?&quot;   The fourth-quarter net loss of $2.42 a share, reflecting awider-than-expected $3.4 billion pretax charge related to thejob cuts, compares with year-ago profit of $2.46 billion, or$4.30 a share. Revenue fell 4.2% to $22.08 billion from$23.06 billion.   Because of the uncertainties, earnings estimates are allover the place. For the first quarter, analysts areprojecting anywhere from 66 cents to $1.20 share vs. thedismal $500 million, or 93 cents a share, in the 1991 firstquarter. For the year, estimates range from $6 to $10 ashare, with $7.60 a share as the average.   That figure would be a turnaround from 1991, when two hugespecial charges gave IBM a loss of $2.83 billion, or $4.95 ashare, the first annual loss in its 80-year history. Still,that average estimate is well short of the $6.02 billion, or$10.51 a share, IBM earned in 1990.   Revenue estimates range less widely, with many analystsprojecting an increase of 6% to 7% from the $64.79 billionIBM produced in 1991. That sort of increase would get IBMback to about the $69.02 billion of revenue it generated in1990.   The confusion showed up in the stock market Friday, as IBMshares initially tumbled $2.875 because its results appearedto be much worse than expected. But the disparity wasattributed largely to special charges, so many analystsconcluded that IBM had, in fact, met expectations, and thestock came roaring back. Even though the stock had risen inthe days ahead of the announcement, in anticipation of theearnings, the stock was at one point up $2.625 on the day. Itfinally closed up 87.5 cents, at $96.375, in compositetrading on the New York Stock Exchange.   &quot;People want to believe in IBM again,&quot; said SteveMilunovich, a securities analyst at Salomon Brothers.   The initial confusion occurred because the added job cutsmeant IBM widened the fourth-quarter pretax charge to $3.4billion from the $3 billion it had said it would take. ThenIBM said in the conference call with analysts that it hadtaken various additional write-downs totaling $200 million to$250 million. That really confused things, because the morebullish analysts immediately added at least $200 million totheir calculations of IBM's operating earnings while the morebearish did not. The bears said IBM often takes smallwrite-downs at year end; it just doesn't tell people aboutthem. Some analysts also said that a lower-than-expected taxrate balanced the negative effects of the write-downs.   In any case, when all the math was done, thefourth-quarter loss became an operating profit of $2.25 to$2.50 a share.   Besides saying that mainframes did well, IBM said itsAS/400 minicomputer line and RS/6000 workstations improved.Another bright spot was services, such as systemsintegration, where revenue rose 35% to $2.05 billion. Still,total hardware sales dropped 11% in the quarter. Inparticular, personal computers continued to have problems, asdid displays, some telecommunications equipment and somedata-storage products. Software revenue, which used toproduce strong double-digit growth, rose 8.5% because thereweren't enough hardware sales to stoke demand.   For the full year, mainframes were the major problem,because the most powerful of the new models weren't availableuntil September, and many customers stopped buying the oldgeneration while they awaited the new ones. IBM's overseasoperations, its best performers in recent years, saw revenuedecline 3.6% to $40.4 billion, and earnings fell to $1.8billion from $4.6 billion in 1990.   Also, IBM took a $2.26 billion charge in the firstquarter, to cover all at once a change in pension accountingthat will reduce earnings at U.S. companies over the nextcouple of years.</TEXT></DOC>
