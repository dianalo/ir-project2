If that sounds like a strange outlook for Europe's largest and strongest economy, just listen to what West German business leaders are saying these days. &quot;The world is changing around us, and we . . . have to be willing to change,&quot; declares Tyll Necker, president of the German Industry Federation. &quot;There is a danger of sliding into a second-class status.&quot;    At the heart of the problem are West Germany's high costs -- the highest in Europe for labor, energy and environmental controls. The strong mark makes investing in West Germany even more expensive for foreigners, who also find the nation's 70% corporate tax rate prohibitive. These handicaps, Mr. Necker says, will become glaring as competition intensifies. The dismantling of trade barriers will diminish the advantages of producing goods in the European Community's biggest market and increase the attractions of doing business in cheaper countries.    &quot;Non-tariff trade barriers will no longer be a factor with a common market, and companies will focus more on the costs,&quot; says Norbert Walter, senior economist for Deutsche Bank AG. &quot;If Bonn's inaction continues, decisions will be made to transfer production elsewhere.&quot;    Other European countries are courting foreign investment with tax concessions. Japanese companies, for instance, last year invested three times as much in Britain as in West Germany, where the corporate tax rate is twice as high.    Just as troubling is the potential for an exodus of West German production. Nixdorf Computer AG recently decided to open a plant in Singapore, where Chairman Klaus Luft says costs are one-seventh those back home. &quot;You take the advantage where you get it,&quot; he says.    A dispute between IBM Deutschland G.m.b.H. with some union members over working on Sunday has raised fears that the unit of International Business Machines Corp. of the U.S. could transfer microchip production abroad to cut operating costs. Adam Opel AG, a unit of General Motors Corp. of the U.S., is buying more auto parts in Britain, Italy and Spain as part of its cost-cutting program. And the West German sporting-goods maker Puma AG now makes 97% of its products abroad after closing two of its three domestic plants last year.    For the first time in memory, foreign companies liquidated more fixed assets in West Germany than they acquired during 1987's first half, repatriating 900 million marks ($531 million). In the same half-year period, West German companies invested 8.2 billion marks in foreign fixed assets, withdrawing only 1.1 billion marks.    According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which coordinates the economies of the industrially developed nations, industrial investment in West German fixed assets grew an average 3.7% a year from 1983 to 1987, compared with 7.8% in Japan and 4% in the U.S. The OECD expects the growth in industrial investment in West Germany to slow to 2% this year and 1.5% in 1989 from 3.25% last year.    The decline prompted the VDMA trade group, which represents the nation's machinery and plant-building industry, to charge the government with &quot;a dangerous miscalculation as to the attractiveness of West Germany as a production site.&quot;    Despite the warning signs, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his finance minister, Gerhard Stoltenberg, are exasperating business by clinging to a watered-down tax-reform plan for 1990 that many think will be too little and too late. The industry wants deregulation and deep tax cuts-period.    &quot;I place little hope in more or less minor changes to economic policy. What we need is relief in the basic structure,&quot; says Klaus Goette, chairman of the MAN AG industrial group.    Senior government officials have begun to take notice. One is Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, whose central bank monitors long-term capital flows. &quot;We have to undergo structural changes here more than we have done,&quot; he says.    West Germany still has advantages: political stability; a skilled work force that produces quality goods; advanced technology and research facilities; and low inflation. Yet, many Germans worry that these selling points might no longer suffice.    In Bonn, Economics Minister Martin Bangemann has emerged as one of industry's few allies. His Free Democratic Party is the coalition government's leading advocate of tax cuts and deregulation. But that goes against Germany's social-welfare doctrines, which no German government forsakes unless it's tired of governing.    &quot;The Federal Republic has lost attractiveness,&quot; Mr. Bangemann wrote in a recent magazine article. &quot;Every day that we close our eyes to this reality increases the economic and social costs of a structural adjustment that, in the final analysis, is inevitable.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
