PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An anti-corruption crusader today defeated morethan two dozen other candidates to win a parliamentary seat despiterunning afoul of the Kremlin for associating top governmentofficials with a corruption probe.   Preliminary returns showed criminal investigator Nikolai Ivanovwon 61 percent of the vote in Leningrad, said Lyudmilla Imanenko,deputy head of the Tass news agency in the country's second-largestcity.   In Sunday's second round of voting for 198 remaining seats inthe 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies, Ivanov was pittedagainst more than two dozen other candidates to represent Leningrad.   The congress, created by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,convenes on May 25 and will chose the president and a new sittinglegislature or Supreme Soviet.   Ivanov and his partner, Telman Gdlyan, are known throughout theSoviet Union for a lengthy probe of corruption in the republic ofUzbekistan. Gdlyan won a parliamentary seat in the first March 26vote, receiving almost 87 percent of ballots in a Moscow district.   But Ivanov ran afoul of the Kremlin in the last days of hiscampaign by saying in a debate televised in Leningrad that thenames of Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev and other top officialscame up in his continuing corruption probe.   In the eastern Ukrainian city Kharkov, officials saidpreliminary data showed editor Vitaly Korotich of thereform-oriented Ogonyok magazine had easily defeated nine othercandidates with 80 percent of the vote.   Strong showings by Ivanov, Korotich and reform candidates in therestive Baltic republics continued a trend set in the Marchelections, which favored reformist and anti-establishmentcandidates.   That ballot was the first nationwide multi-candidate election inthe Soviet Union in 70 years.   In Estonia, Klara Hallik, a lecturer and expert on ethnicrelations at Tallinn Polytechnical Institute, won 50.74 percent ofthe vote. She was backed by the Estonian People's Front.   In neighboring Latvia, voters handed reformer Maveriks Vulfsonsa narrow victory in a Riga district. People's Front officials inthe republic said their candidates won five of the six races there.   Voters in Kiev narrowed a slate of 33 candidates to two.Economist Vladimir Chernyak, a leader of the Ukrainian People'sFront, will face editor Vitaly Karpenko of the official newspaperVecherny Kiev in a third vote, said local election official LydiaVoronova.   The People's Front grassroots movements seek economicindependence from Moscow.   In Moscow, Olympic weight-lifting champion Yuri Vlasov wasseeking a seat from the Lublinsky region. Reformist playwrightMikhail Shatrov and Afghanistan war hero Alexander Rudskoy wereamong the candidates in the Kuntsovsky district.   In the religious center Zagorsk, well-known news commentatorAlexander Bovin and conservative editor Anatoly Ivanov were amongthe candidates.   In the March elections, voters embarrassed dozens of localCommunist Party and government officials in Leningrad, Kiev, Moscowand other major cities.   Most of those who lost in March did not run again.   The new parliament will choose the president and a new sittinglegislature or Supreme Soviet, but many of its functions andprocedures have yet to be decided.   Repeat elections were held in 195 districts where voters weregiven a choice of only one or two candidates on March 26 andrefused to elect anyone.   In three districts of Armenia, elections were held Sundaybecause fewer than half the voters went to the polls in March.   Ivanov and Gdlyan became national heroes last summer when anarticle they wrote for Korotich's magazine led to a dramaticconfrontation on nationwide television. Korotich handed Gorbachev alist of delegates to the June Communist Party conference who wereimplicated in bribery.   But recently the Kremlin has come down hard on the prosecutors.   The leadership of the Supreme Soviet attacked the two in astatement published election eve in the Communist Party dailyPravda, accusing them of trying to ``interfere in the work of aspecially formed commission'' looking into complaints about theirinvestigative practices.</TEXT></DOC>
