The Journal's response to the biggest political scandal since Watergate has been oddly subdued. True, there have been, by my count, six editorials during the past month (about the same number the Journal might devote in a typical month to the need for a line-item veto). But there have been none now for more than a week.    What unites the Journal's editorials is the calm insistence that the president was right to do what he did, whatever that may have been, and as for the things he hasn't done, he would have been right to do them too, if he had done them, which he didn't. On Nov. 21, when only the Iran side of the equation was known, the editors observed (&quot;The Purpose of Presidents&quot;): &quot;What is important is that the president identified an extremely important policy need and acted on it.&quot; The editors' only complaint about his &quot;occasionally disjointed&quot; (i.e., semi-coherent) press conference was that he had &quot;fail{ed} to elaborate&quot; on &quot;the geostrategic importance of Iran.&quot;    The geostrategic importance of Iran! The president is not the only one who has failed to educate the public on this &quot;crucial point.&quot; If the need to curry favor with Iran is so obvious and urgent, why has The Wall Street Journal run no editorials over the past few years criticizing the Reagan administration for its official policy of ostracizing that country because of its role in promoting terrorism? Only when the administration's actual policy turned out to be exactly the opposite did the Journal discover that exactly the opposite was exactly the right policy. Of course, &quot;Drawing the hostages into the process may have been a mistake,&quot; the editors conceded. This was back when the administration was insisting that the hostages were merely incidental to the secret policy. That tack has since been abandoned in light of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, but the Journal has not been moved to reevaluate.    When the contra connection was revealed, the Journal did not flinch. &quot;For our money,&quot; the editors wrote (&quot;A President's Troubles,&quot; Nov. 26), President Reagan &quot;should have said, yes, I sent the money to the contras in pursuit of my powers as commander-in-chief.&quot; But wait a minute. Wasn't there a law against this sort of thing? Exactly, said this paper. That's why White House aides had to &quot;go to such elaborate lengths&quot; to circumvent it in secret. A lesser newspaper might have struggled for a bit with the question of why White House aides should not have obeyed the law instead of evading it, but that tedious subject was not raised at all in this particular essay.    In other editorials discussing relations between the president and Congress, the editors of the Journal have made sweeping yet mysterious references to Article II of the Constitution. They appear to believe this provision reads: &quot;In matters of foreign policy, the president shall have dictatorial power, including the power to sign democratically enacted legislation and then do precisely the opposite of what it says.&quot;    Since the president is infallible, the chaos that results from this approach is obviously Congress's fault. Back on Nov. 21, the Journal observed presciently that laws like the Boland Amendment (forbidding aid to the contras) are &quot;an incentive for the presidency to pull policy into an ever tighter circle, away from a legislated system and a Washington culture that now strangles decisions.&quot; In other words, it's OK for members of Congress to discuss foreign policy, as long as they don't try to do anything about it. If they do, the president cannot be blamed for simply ignoring any laws they are silly enough to pass.    The Journal's longest editorial relating to Iranamok (&quot;Ronald Reagan's Future,&quot; Dec. 1) was more on the order of a commercial break. While others brooded on the collapse of the presidency, this newspaper paused to observe, &quot;The U.S. in 1986 finds itself a superpower in an exciting, integrating world-wide political economy.&quot; It brutishly urged the president to fire all the old farts, regardless of culpability, and bring in a new generation of bright young Article II authoritarians.    On Dec. 3, &quot;we felt for the first time that {Ronald Reagan} was starting to get a grip on his Iran problem.&quot; Never mind Mr. Reagan's grip. How about the Journal's? &quot;A man from Mars . . . would have trouble understanding the excitement.&quot; The editors query: What's it all about? Geopolitics? Hostages? &quot;How to organize the foreign-policy bureaucracy&quot;? Pardon my asking, but what about close aides to the president brazenly breaking the law and subverting democracy? Oh, you mean &quot;the technicality of an obstruction of justice&quot;? Nonsense, sayeth the editors. &quot;If the activities came a cropper because they were done outside of channels, it is largely because Congress has not allowed the executive to play its proper role in foreign policy.&quot; In fact, &quot;we . . . admire Oliver North's extraordinary enterprise.&quot;    The editors wrote -- almost with disappointment -- that they believe Mr. Reagan's claim to have known nothing about all this. Disappointment, because this deprived them of the chance to &quot;mount a constitutional defense of his actions.&quot; Nevertheless (and here comes my very favorite passage in this whole series of editorials), Mr. Reagan's ignorance in this particular case &quot;fits perfectly well with the hands-off, directional kind of leadership that has served him so well for six years.&quot; Love is truly blind. &quot;Hands-off leadership&quot; may arguably have served Mr. Reagan well in the past, and his reputation for breathtaking ignorance may yet allow him to slither out of culpability in this case. But how can any newspaper reader, let alone a newspaper writer, observe the fiasco of the past month and say this is an example of successful hands-off leadership?    In the past two weeks, the Journal has had virtually nothing to say about the essence of the scandal itself. Dec. 9, at the end of a long review of congressional policy toward Nicaragua (&quot;Borderline Warfare&quot;), the editors grumped that Congress's &quot;approach to Nicaragua has been to enact pettifogging restrictions, and then complain that an administration trying to conduct a policy is 'violating the law.'&quot; Those quotation marks are masterfully contemptuous, as if &quot;violating the law&quot; were some slangy and meaningless juvenile insult on the order of &quot;having a spaz attack.&quot;    Finally, on Dec. 10 (&quot;The Investigators' Votes&quot;), the Journal noted that most members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which has been holding hearings on the scandal, voted against contra aid. In the editors' view, this gives them no right to be &quot;indignant that two members of the administration wouldn't talk to them.&quot; Possibly for reasons of space, the editors failed to elucidate the connection between these two issues: how a congressman voted on contra aid, and whether Congress is entitled to review the conduct of the executive branch. Who knows? Perhaps the Article II of The Wall Street Journal's fevered imagination provides that congressmen who disagree with the president have no right to ask questions. I'd like to read more about that some day. </TEXT></DOC>
