Because of such epidemiological evidence, the subject ofradiation protection in the nuclear mining industry has received increasedattention in recent years both at national and international levels.The radiation hazards encountered in the uranium mining industry resultprimarily from the exposure to radon daughters. The exposure to externalradiation in most mines is low; however, in the mining of high gradeuranium ores external radiation exposure can be substantially higher.By adopting proper control measures, namely, regulatory control, appropriatesafety standards, monitoring, engineering and other measures, medicalsurveillance, environmental protection and radioactive waste management,it is possible to minimize the health risk to a level deemed to be acceptablein the light of the benefit derived from the uranium mining industry.Recognizing the history of excess lung cancer among uranium miners andthe nature of the associated radiation protection problems there havebeen considerable national and international efforts to develop safetystandards, codes of practice and guides to improve the radiation protectionpractices for the protection of the workers and the general public. Atthe international level the role of the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA), the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP),the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the World Health Organization(WHO), and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development/NuclearEnergy Agency (OECD/NEA) has been to develop and provide guidance forimproved radiation protection in the uranium mining industry. In thepaper the radiological problems in this industry, the types of controlmeasures and the international efforts in harmonizing radiation protectionmeasures are discussed.
