Extended regulations for dealing with old plant were introducedinto part 4. The limitation of emission protects the environment againstdamage. Where there are Orders for emission limitation for certain typesof plant, such as large boilers, for example, these have precedence overthe TA-Luft. The basis of the part of the TA-Luft which limits emissionremained unchanged. General requirements for limiting emission are set,which apply for all plants which require authorisation according to 4.BImSchV.</TEXT></DOC>
