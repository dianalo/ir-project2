The plan Serves asthe basis for Federal response to assist State and local governments impactedby a catastrophic earthquake, or, if appropriate, another natural catastrophicevent. The Plan focuses on providing supplemental support during emergencyresponse operations to save lives and protect property. Individual departmentand agency emergency authorities, as well as assignments of responsibilityunder the provisions of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and EmergencyAssistance Act (Pub. L. 93-288, as amended) to accomplish this support,are identified in the Plan. Delivery of Federal assistance will be managedand coordinated by the Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO), as authorizedby section 302 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and EmergencyAssistance Act. The Plan is not meant to create enforceable rights in thirdparties.A notice to initiate Federal planning was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> March 4, 1983 (48 FR 9466). The final proposedNational Plan for Federal Response to a Catastrophic Earthquake was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> June 30, 1986 (51 FR 23624) as an operative plan.A notice of the publication of the final plan was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 5, 1987 (52 FR 213712).The changes contained herein are the result of the annual review of thePlan undertaken by the Subcommittee on Federal Earthquake Response Planning.This review allowed each department/agency to clarify and reassess thecommitments made to carry out the Federal response to a catastrophic earthquakethrough its Plan assignments. The following is a summary of the most significantchanges.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Major Changes to the Plan</ITAG>1. References in the Plan will be changed to reflect the new title forthe Disaster Relief Act of 1974. The title has been changed to the ``RobertT. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act'' by Pub. L. 100-707.2. The operational support group for the Catastrophic Disaster ResponseGroup (CDRG) known as the Emergency Staff Support Group (ESSG) has beenrenamed the Emergency Support Team_Earthquake (EST-EQ). The operationalsupport group for the Federal Coordinating Officer known as the EmergencySupport Team (EST) has been renamed the Emergency Response Team_Earthquake(ERT-EQ). These changes will make the Plan compatible with the existingFEMA response organization.3. The Scope and Policies for Emergency Support Function 6 (Mass Care)have been rewritten for purposes of clarification.4.

PurposeThe purpose of this ESF is to provide Federal support to State and localgovernments in response to an actual or potential discharge and/or releaseof hazardous materials following a catastrophic earthquake.B. Structure of AnnexWithin the context of this ESF, the term ``Hazardous Materials'' is definedbroadly to include oil, hazardous substances and/or radiological materials.However, Federal response to releases of ``hazardous materials'' is carriedout under separate and distinct Federal Plans:andbullet; The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution ContingencyPlan (NCP) (40 CFR 300) which provides for Federal response to oil dischargesand releases of hazardous substances (chemical, toxic, pollutant, contaminant);and andbullet; The Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan (FRERP) (FR 46542)which provides for Federal response to peacetime radiological emergencies.While there are aspects of emergency response under this ESF that are commonto both the NCP and the FRERP, there are also response components thatare unique to each Plan. We have addressed those differences by dividingmost sections of this ESF into one or more subsections: andbullet; <T3>General </T3>discusses the response elements and/or information commonto both Plans and their respective programs; andbullet; <T3>NCP/Oil and Hazardous Substances </T3>which addresses the responseelements and/or information pertinent to the NCP; and andbullet; <T3>FRERP/Radiological Materials </T3>which discusses the response elementsand/or information relevant to the FRERP. Where a section of this ESF has not been divided into one of more of thesesubsections, then the material presented applies to both the NCP and theFRERP. <T3>C. Scope </T3><ITAG tagnum="81">General </ITAG>This ESF provides for a coordinated response to actual or potential dischargesand/or releases of hazardous materials by placing the response mechanismsof the NCP and FRERP within a combined coordination structure to assurethe most efficient and effective use of Federal resources. It includesthe appropriate response actions to prevent, minimize, or mitigate a threatto public health, welfare, or the environment. This ESF establishes the lead coordination roles, the division and specificationof responsibilities among Federal agencies, and the national and on-siteresponse organization that may be brought to bear in response actions,including description of the organizations, response personnel, and resourcesthat are available. This ESF is applicable to all Federal departments andagencies with responsibilities and assets to support State and local responseto actual or potential discharges and/or releases of hazardous materials.<ITAG tagnum="81">NCP/Oil and Hazardous Substances </ITAG>Response to oil discharges and hazardous substance releases will be inaccordance with the policy and procedures contained in the National Oiland Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP). The NCP effectuatesthe response powers and responsibilities created by the Comprehensive EnvironmentalResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, (CERCLA) and theauthorities established by section 311 of the Clean Water Act, as amended(CWA). Under the policies established by the NCP, a pre-designated On-SceneCoordinator(s), selected from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(EPA), Coast Guard (USCG), Department of Defense (DOD), or Department ofEnergy (DOE) would undertake response actions. Appropriate response actionsunder the NCP include: stabilization of berms, dikes, or impoundments;capping of contaminated soils or sludges; use of chemicals and other materialsto contain or retard the spread of the release or to mitigate its effects;drainage controls; fences, warning signs, or other security or site controlprecautions; removal of highly contaminated soils from drainage areas;removal of drums, barrels, tanks, or other bulk containers that containhazardous substances; and other measures as deemed necessary. <ITAG tagnum="81">FRERP/Radiological Materials </ITAG>Response to actual or potential releases of radiological materials willbe carried out in accordance with the Federal Radiological Emergency ResponsePlan (FRERP). Under the policies established in the FRERP, a CognizantFederal Agency (CFA) will be responsible for the technical aspects of theFederal response to a peacetime radiological emergency event. The CFA willdesignate a Cognizant Federal Agency Official (CFAO) to coordinate activitiesat the emergency site. A CFA representative will report directly to theFederal Coordinating Officer, and will coordinate FRERP response actionswith this ESF.D. Relation to Existing Response Under the NCP and the National/RegionalResponse Team(s)Coordination of response actions carried out under this ESF does not conflictwith the NCP duties and responsibilities of the National Response Team/RegionalResponse Teams.The National Response Team (NRT), composed of 13 Federal agencies withmajor environmental and public health responsibilities for oil and hazardoussubstance releases, is the primary vehicle for coordinating Federal agencyactivities under the NCP. The Team carries out national planning and responsecoordination and is the head of a highly organized Federal oil and hazardoussubstance emergency response network. At the Headquarters level, activitiesunder this ESF provide a ``bridge'' between the National Response Teamand the Catastrophic Disaster Response Group (CDRG). The CDRG is a nationallevel policy group representing all 25 Departments and Agencies havingany responsibility for response activities following a catastrophic earthquakeor other catastrophic natural event.The Regional Response Team (RRTs) are made up of regional representativesof the Federal agencies on the NRT as well as a representative from eachState within the Region. The RRTs serve as planning and preparedness bodiesbefore a response, marshal their respective agency response resources,and provide coordination and advice to the Federal OSC(s) during responseactions. At the Regional level, activities under this ESF provide a ``bridge''between the on-site OSC directed NCP response with RRT support and theoverall disaster response activities carried out at the Disaster FieldOffice which is managed by a Federal Coordinating Officer who has beenspecially appointed by the President.If the National Catastrophic Earthquake Plan is invoked and there are hazardousmaterials releases necessitating the activation of this ESF, the NRT/RRTswould carry out their duties and responsibilities as put forth in the NCPand agency implementing procedures. Those efforts will focus largely onspecific oil and hazardous substances releases that may occur throughoutthe affected area. There is a need, however, for an overall coordinationmechanism for the Federal hazardous materials response because:andbullet; It is likely that there will be several releases occurring simultaneouslymaking heavy demands on response resources. Damage information must begathered quickly, analyzed in a central location, and response prioritiesestablished as soon as possible in order to make the best use of resourcesand to ensure the most efficient overall response.andbullet; Information on response activities must be provided to the DisasterField Office and the Federal Coordinating Officer on a continuous basis.In some cases, this information could be coming in from more than one Stateor even one Region. To avoid confusion, this information should flow throughone source;andbullet; Many of the NRT/RRT agencies will also be involved in respondingto the earthquake or other catastrophe under other ESFs, hence there maybe conflicting demands on agency resources. For example, the Departmentof Defense, which has provided personnel and equipment for NCP responsesin the past, is also a Primary Agency for ESF 9 as well as a Support Agencyto the fother 10 ESFs. There may be heavy and conflicting demands uponDOD resources. Any such resource conflicts will have to be resolved throughthe ESFs at the DFO and CDRG level.This ESF will provide that overall coordination for Federal response activitiesassociated with hazardous materials releases.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Policies</ITAG>A. NCP/FRERPThe NCP and/or the FRERP serve as the basis for planning and utilizationof federal resources for responding to releases or threats of releasesof, in the case of the NCP, oil or hazardous substances, and in the caseof the FRERP, radiological materials. Response actions under this ESF willfollow the policies, procedures, directives and guidance developed to carryout the provisions contained in the NCP and/or the FRERP.B. Support AgenciesIn accordance with the assignment of responsibilities in this annex, supportagencies (see Section V.B of this ESF) will provide resources and supportin response to a release or threat of a release of oil, hazardous substances,and/or radiological materials.To the extent possible at both the Headquarters and Regional-level, supportagency representatives to this ESF should be those personnel also assignedto the National or Regional Response Team(s). The EPA Co-Chair of the RegionalResponse Team should also Chair the Regional ESF. Even if such dual assignmentsare not possible, each ESF representative is to maintain close coordinationwith their Agency's National/Regional Response Team representative.C. Multiple Response ActionsWhen more than one Federal OSC or CFA is involved in implementing response(e.g., due to multiple response actions), the ESF will be the mechanismthrough which close coordination will be maintained among all agencies,OSCs, and CFAs. The EPA Regional Chairman of this ESF and the CFA willassure that response actions are properly coordinated and carried out.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Situation</ITAG>A. Disaster ConditionA catastrophic earthquake could result in numerous situations in whichhazardous materials are released into the environment. Fixed facilities(e.g., chemical plants, tank farms, laboratories, operating hazardous wastesites, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and agreement State licensees, ornuclear production facilities operated by DOE) which produce, generate,use, store, or dispose of hazardous materials could be damaged so severelythat existing spill control apparatus and containment measures are noteffective. Nuclear weapons in the possession of either DOE or DOD couldbe impaired. Hazardous materials that are transported may be involved inrail accidents, highway collisions, or waterway mishaps. Abandoned hazardouswaste sites could be damaged causing further degradation of holding ponds,tanks, and drums.B. Planning Assumptions1. States and localities will be overwhelmed by the extent of the responseeffort required to assess, mitigate, monitor, cleanup, and dispose of hazardousmaterials released into the environment.2. There will be numerous incidents occurring simultaneously in separatelocations, both inland and along coastal waters.3. Standard communications practices (telecommunications, radio, etc.)will be disrupted.4. Response personnel, cleanup crews, and monitoring and response equipmentwill have difficulty in reaching the site of a hazardous materials releasebecause of the damage sustained by the transportation infrastructure (roads,rails, bridges, etc.).5. Additional response/cleanup personnel and equipment will be needed tosupplement existing capabilities.6. Even if the catastrophic earthquake does not cause situations wherethere are actual releases, there would be considerable concern about facilitieswhich are located in or near the area affected by the earthquake.7. Laboratories responsible for hazardous materials sample analysis willbe damaged or destroyed.8. Air transportation will be needed for damage reconnaissance and to transportpersonnel and equipment to the site of a release.9. Emergency exemptions will be needed for disposal of contaminated material.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Concept of Operations</ITAG>A. Scope<ITAG tagnum="81">General</ITAG>This ESF will promote an efficient, coordinated, and effective responseto discharges or releases or hazardous materials into or threatening theenvironment. The operational response as prescribed in the NCP and theFRERP, and any agency implementing procedures that contribute to response,will be coordinated through this ESP. In conjunction with the State, theESF will coordinate the provision of support and the overall managementto the various response sites to ensure actions are taken to mitigate,clean up, and dispose of hazardous materials and minimize the impact ofthe incidents. The ESF will provide for close coordination with Federal,State, and local officials to establish priorities for response support.The ESF will also provide for coordination with ESF 5 (Damage Information)to obtain and provide information on the extent of discharges or releasesinto or threatening the environment.Support agency representatives to this ESF will maintain close coordinationwith designated representatives of their agency (or both this ESF as wellas others ESFs) to obtain information on types of releases and criticalresponse operations. ESF members will provide advice to the decision makingprocess to ensure actions taken and response support are effective.This ESF will coordinate efforts to identify and quantify requests forhazardous materials response assistance, and evaluate State and local responsecapabilities. The ESF will provide for and maintain close coordinationwith the Disaster Office (DFO) and the ESFs throughout the response period.In addition, this ESF will document all activities to support after-actionrequirements and justify actions taken.As designated primary agency, EPA will provide the overall leadership forthe planning and implementation of this ESF.<ITAG tagnum="81">NCP/Oil and Hazardous Substances</ITAG>If the NCP is implemented in association with a catastrophic earthquake,then all NCP policies and procedures will be followed. One or more pre-designatedOSCs will be dispatched to coordinate and direct oil and hazardous substancesremoval actions. Depending upon the location of the incident(s), the OSC(s)may be provided by either the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S.Coast Guard, the Department of Defense, or the Department of Energy. TheRegional Chairman of this ESF, in close coordination with the RRT, is responsiblefor assuring that the actions of all OSCs are coordinated closely in orderto make the best use of response resources and to avoid gaps or overlapsin response actions.<ITAG tagnum="81">FRERP/Radiological Materials</ITAG>When there is an event in association with the catastrophic earthquakewhich requires implementation of various facets of the FRERP, a CFA willact in accordance with the FRERP; DOE will support the CFA in monitoringand assessing the radiological situation. The CFA will appoint a Lead Respresentativeto this ESF on-scene. This Representative will coordinate the FRERP responsewith the ESF Chairman and will report the status of radiological responseactions to the Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) on behalf of the CognizantFederal Agency Official (CFAO).B. OrganizationFigure 10.1 depicts the national and regional organizational structurefor this ESF for situations in which only oil and/or hazardous substancesincidents occur and the NCP is implemented.

The Hazardous Materials ESF will be implemented underthe direction of the Director, Preparedness Staff, Office of Solid Wasteand Emergency Response, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) whowill also serve as the Chairman for this ESF.b. The Chairman will represent the ESF in all interactions with the CatastrophicDisaster Response Group (CDRG) and will maintain liaison with the RegionalESF Chairman.c. The ESF operations location is in the EPA Headquarters. ESF memberswill have representatives available immediately by phone on a 24-hour basisduring the emergency response period. The ESF Chairman will determine,following an initial situation assessment, which agencies will be requiredto provide representatives to the ESF on a 24-hour basis (either by phoneor in person) during the emergency response period. The EPA PreparednessStaff office will provide administrative support to this ESF.<T3>NCP/Oil and Hazardous Substances. </T3>d. All policies and proceduresin the NCP will be adhered to in carrying out an oil/hazardous substanceresponse under this ESF. The ESF Chairman will consult with the Oil andHazardous Substance National Response Team for advice and assistance incarrying out activities under this ESF. Likewise, the Regional ESF Chairmanwill consult with the Regional Response Team for such advice or assistance.<T3>FRERP/Radiological Materials. </T3>e. If a radiological event is severeenough to warrant implementation of the FRERP, each of the potential CFAs(DOE, NRC, and DOD) will follow their FRERP implementing procedures andwill designate an official to participate in the implementation of thisESF.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Regional Level Response Structure</ITAG><T3>General. </T3>a. The EPA Regional Administrator will designate theChairman of the regional ESF. To the extent possible, the EPA RegionalResponse Team Co-Chairman should also serve as the Regional Chairman ofthis ESF.b. If the FRERP is implemented, an official of the CFA will be designatedto keep the ESF informed of the FRERP response and to represent the CFAO.c. The ESF Regional Chairman and/or CFA Representative will represent theESF in its dealings with the FCO, and will maintain close coordinationwith support agencies, other on-scene ESFs, the Chairman of the nationalESF, the On-Scene Coordinator(s), the Regional Response Team (RRT), andState officials.d. The regional level ESF is comprised of the regional representativesof those Federal agencies listed in section V of this ESF.e. The regional ESF Chairman will report to the DFO for the duration ofthe emergency response period. Regional ESF members will have representativesimmediately available to support this ESF on a 24-hour basis by phone and,if requested, in person. In conjunction with support agency representatives,the ESF Regional Chairman and/or CFA representative will determine thenecessary staffing of this ESF following an initial situation assessment.It is expected that initially, as a minimum, representatives of DOD, DOE,NRC, HHS, and the USCG will be required to participate with EPA as membersof the ESF.<T3>NCP/Oil and Hazardous Substances. </T3>f. The Regional Chairman ofthe ESF will be supported by predesignated Federal OSCs provided by EPAfor discharges and releases into or threatening the inland zone, the U.S.Coast Guard for discharges or releases into or threatening the coastalzone, by DOD for hazardous substance releases from DOD facilities and vessels,or by DOE for hazardous substance releases from DOE facilities.g. The OSC directs oil and hazardous substance response efforts and coordinatesall other Federal efforts at the scene of a discharge or release. Specificresponse efforts are noted in the NCP and include actions taken as soonas possible to prevent, minimize, or mitigate a threat to public health,welfare, or the environment.h.

Office Facilities Including</ITAG>Office space, conference rooms, and clerical support for both the nationaland regional ESF for a 15-person staff on a 24-hour basis.B. Assets Required for Continuing OperationsThe assets required for the initial 12 hours also will be required forthe remainder of the response period with requirements modified as follows:<ITAG tagnum="81">NCP/Oil and Hazardous Substances</ITAG>1. Personnel requirements of this ESF in the field will increase afterthe initial assessments of oil and hazardous substances releases are completed.Teams of technical personnel including chemists, engineers, environmentalscientists, etc., will be dispatched to the scene of each oil or hazardoussubstance incident to sample, monitor, and oversee cleanup operations.Cleanup personnel, trained in oil and hazardous substances response, willbe needed at each site. Some incidents can be stabilized quickly, whileothers will take much longer. Following stabilization, containment andcleanup efforts may take weeks to complete.2. Communications requirements will increase to include voice and messagesystems connecting all regional ESF personnel with each other, and withHeadquarters staff. This ESF will need access to communications systemssuch as those maintained by FEMA, DOD, or others.3. Headquarters and Regional facility requirements for office and conferencerooms may increase.4. Field requirements will include portable command posts, and temporarystorage facilities for equipment and for drums and other overpacked materialsawaiting disposal.5. Field personnel and response equipment will need to be transported quicklyto the scene of an incident, but may encounter problems due to disruptionsin the roadway infrastructure. Rapid transport deployment requires theuse of airplanes, helicopters, fire and high-speed power boats, as wellas over-land vehicles that can function where the roadway infrastructureremains intact.6. Headquarters and field office supplies will be needed for the durationof activities under this Plan.7. Requirements for special equipment for field use include heavy equipmentsuch as earth moving equipment, drum grapplers, etc.; containment equipmentsuch as booms, berms, fences, pond liners, drum overpacks, etc.; personalprotective gear such as self-contained breathing apparatus, oil and chemicalresistant outer clothing, safety boots, hard hats, etc.; and response equipmentincluding oil and chemical sampling and monitoring equipment.<ITAG tagnum="81">FRERP/Radiological Materials</ITAG>8. If there is a significant release of radioactive materials, this incidentwill receive major attention and will require additional assets. Most ofthese assets will be related to the large effort needed to monitor sucha release. It would also be expected that such a situation would put morepressure on all the other support systems. It is not expected that specialand unique requirements will be identified for these other functions. However,continuous communications and coordination will be necessary.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII.
