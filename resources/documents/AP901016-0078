Standard and Poors' latest Executive College Survey lists fourexecutives as having received degrees from Baltimore City College.   As Baltimore residents know well, Baltimore City College is ahigh school.   ``We'll do our best to rectify this,'' said Ellen Hartery,assistant supervisor of Compmark Data Services, the Standard andPoors subsidiary that compiles the survey.   The survey is designed to show which colleges graduate the mostpeople who go on to become corporate executives. It lists roughly500 colleges and about 54,000 executives, Hartery said Tuesday.   The survey form asked executives to list their undergraduate andgraduate degrees. Hartery said the number of entries made itimpossible for Sandamp;P to verify the information.   Baltimore City College is accustomed to confusion over its name,said college spokesman Joseph Antenson.   ``We get calls several times a day from people wanting to enrollin graduate programs or people trying to contact the CCB (CommunityCollege of Baltimore),'' Antenson said.</TEXT></DOC>
