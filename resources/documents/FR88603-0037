Background</ITAG>A. SummaryIn 1983, Congress called on DoD to establish a new method to pay hospitalsfor inpatient care under CHAMPUS, to be modeled after the recently establishedprospective payment system for the Medicare program. Rather than just payingbilled charges, the new method was to pay fixed rates for particular categoriesof medical care, grouped into diagnosis-related groups, or DRGs. This Congressionalaction was followed by a 1986 law giving CHAMPUS the practical abilityto adopt a new payment method by linking hospital participation in Medicarewith that in CHAMPUS.Paying hospitals on the basis of prospectively determined amounts per dischargelimits the financial liability of CHAMPUS, yet at the same time providesfair treatment and positive incentives for hospitals. Instead of payinghospitals whatever they charge for whatever services they provide, CHAMPUSnow pays hospitals fixed rates in general regardless of how long the patientstays or how many procedures the hospital provides. By paying hospitalsaccording to DRG, this system recognizes the different amount of resourcesrequired to care for patients with different diagnoses, demographic characteristics,and specific procedures performed. Hospitals may keep the difference betweenthe amount paid for care and the amount it cost to provide the care. Thus,efficient hospitals have the opportunity to enhance their financial position.On September 1, 1987, we published a final rule (52 FR 32992) to implementthe CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. On September 15, 1987, we publishedan amendment to the final rule (52 FR 34775) which contained the finaladjusted standardized amounts. This was followed by a notice on March 1,1988 (53 FR 6182) which implemented a new Grouper Program and the resultantrevised weights and rates as well as certain provisions of the 1988 Departmentof Defense Appropriations Act which exempted certain services from theCHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. The regulations governing the CHAMPUSDRG-based payment system are located in 32 CFR Part 199.This October, Medicare will be entering its sixth year under the DRG paymentsystem and CHAMPUS will be entering its second. It has been found to bea fair, effective method for paying for quality hospital care.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Major Contents of This Proposed Rule</ITAG>This proposed rule would be effective for the second year of operationof the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system beginning on October 1, 1988. Followingis a summary of the major changes that we are proposing to make to thesystem.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Exemption of Certain Pediatric Services from the CHAMPUS DRG-BasedPayment System</ITAG>We are now proposing that discharges involving pediatric bone marrow transplants,children determined to be HIV seropositive, and pediatric cystic fibrosisbe exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Reclassification of Areas for the Adjusted Standardized Amounts</ITAG>We are proposing to implement three adjusted standardized amounts_for largeurban areas, other urban areas, and rural areas. These changes will conformto those implemented under the Medicare PPS and published on April 5, 1988(53 FR 11134).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Redesignation of Certain Rural Areas as Urban Areas</ITAG>We are proposing to adopt the changes made for the Medicare PPS under whichcertain rural areas, because of their proximity to urban areas, are redesignatedas urban areas.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Medicare Cost-to-Charge Ratio</ITAG>We are proposing to use a cost-to-charge ratio of .6368 as calculated bythe Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and published in the May1988 Medicare PPS proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Alcohol/Drug Abuse Services</ITAG>We are proposing to begin coverage initially deferred for alcohol/drugabuse services and include them under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system.Generally, payment for these services will be made using the DRGs in useunder the Medicare PPS and using the weights and rates developed for theCHAMPUS final rule to be published on or about September 1, 1988. The oneexception to the Medicare approach is that DRG 435, which represents themajority of CHAMPUS alcohol/drug abuse cases, will be split into two agegroups.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Children's Hospitals</ITAG>We are proposing to begin coverage initially deferred for these hospitals.Payment to these hospitals will be made under the CHAMPUS DRG-based paymentsystem, but, in recognition of the higher costs of care in these hospitals,a ``children's hospital differential'' will be developed which will beused to increase each DRG-based payment to children's hospitals.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Neonate Services</ITAG>We are proposing to begin coverage initially deferred for these services.When incorporated into the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, payment forthese services will take into consideration infants' birthweights as recommendedin the Children's DRGs (CDRGs) developed by the National Association ofChildren's Hospitals and Related Institutions (NACHRI). We are currentlydeveloping the database necessary to calculate the relative weights forthe CDRGs. We will also consider modifying the outlier policy for theseservices.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Outliers</ITAG>We are proposing to revise our outlier procedures in accordance with mostof the changes proposed for the Medicare PPS in the May 1988, proposedrule.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Burn Outliers</ITAG>We are proposing to use the Medicare PPS burn outlier procedures publishedon April 5, 1988 (53 FR 11137).<ITAG tagnum="81">10. Other Minor Changes and Clarifications to the Existing Procedures</ITAG>There are a number of minor changes or clarifications to the provisionscurrently in the CHAMPUS regulation which we are proposing. These are:<ITAG tagnum="15">_We are proposing to use the new Grouper Program used under the MedicarePPS beginning October 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_We are proposing to use the same update factors used by Medicare.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_We are proposing to use a revised formula for calculating the indirectmedical education adjustment factor to reflect the revisions made in theMedicare formula.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_We are proposing that the per diem cost-sharing amount for beneficiariesother than dependents of active-duty members include an amount to recognizehospitals' costs for capital and direct medical education.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_We are proposing to eliminate the requirement that a hospital's requestfor payment of capital and direct medical education costs be submittedto the CHAMPUS contractor within three months of the end of the hospital'sMedicare cost-reporting period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_We are proposing clarifications to the definitions of ``total inpatientdays'' and ``total CHAMPUS inpatient days'' which are required on hospitals'requests for capital and direct medical education payments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_We are clarifying how the percentage reductions for capital paymentswhich are required under the Medicare PPS will be applied under the CHAMPUSDRG-based payment system.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_We are proposing to use the wage index amounts published for theMedicare PPS in their proposed rule for FY 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_We are clarifying a cross-reference regarding our intention thathospital-based professionals are to be reimbursed using the allowable chargemethodology.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">II. Exemption of Certain Pediatric Services from the CHAMPUS DRG-BasedPayment System</ITAG>Section 8064 of Pub. L. 100-202, the 1988 Department of Defense AppropriationsAct, required certain pediatric services to be excluded from the CHAMPUSDRG-based payment system because of possible inadequacies in the DRG classificationsystem for these conditions. CHAMPUS has not yet studied ways of improvingthe classification of these conditions. Therefore, we are proposing thatthe following services continue to be exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-basedpayment system until appropriate classification changes can be made. Theexemption applies whether the stated condition is the principal or a secondarydiagnosis.A. All services related to discharges involving pediatric (beneficiaryless than 18 years old upon admission) bone marrow transplants. This willbe ICD-9-CM diagnosis code V42.8 and ICD-9 procedure codes 41.0 and 41.91.B. All services related to discharges involving children (beneficiary lessthan 18 years old upon admission) who have been determined to be HIV seropositive.This will be IDC-9-CM diagnosis codes 042 through 044 and 795.8.C. All services related to discharges involving pediatric (beneficiaryless than 18 years old upon admission) cystic fibrosis. This will be ICD-9-CMdiagnosis code 277.<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Reclassification of Areas for the Adjusted Standardized Amounts</ITAG>Under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, separate adjusted standardizedamounts are calculated for urban and rural areas. In our original proposedrule which was published on June 3, 1987 (52 FR 20731), we proposed usinga single national adjusted standardized amount. However, based on the commentswe received and an analysis of CHAMPUS claims, we decided that the gapbetween urban and rural payments was sufficient to warrant an urban/ruraldifferentiation in the payment system. We therefore adopted the same areadifferentiations used under the Medicare PPS.Under section 4002(c)(1) of Pub. L. 100-203, the Medicare PPS is now requiredto compute three adjusted standardized amounts: one for hospitals locatedin rural areas; one for hospitals located in large urban areas; and onefor hospitals located in other urban areas. A large urban area is definedas an urban area with a population of more than 1,000,000 or a New EnglandCounty Metropolitan Area with a population of more than 970,000.Just as for the previous distinction of urban and rural areas, we believethis further distinction of large urban areas and other urban areas isappropriate for CHAMPUS. We are, therefore, proposing to use the threeadjusted standardized amounts in determining payment under the CHAMPUSDRG-based payment system. The large urban areas to be used are those usedfor the Medicare PPS as published by the HCFA in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 5, 1988 (53 FR 11138).<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Redesignation of Certain Rural Areas as Urban Areas</ITAG>Section 4005(a) of Pub. L. 100-203 requires the Medicare PPS to treat hospitalslocated in certain rural counties which are adjacent to one or more urbanareas as being located in an urban area. Under the Medicare PPS this provisionis effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1988. Therefore,those areas affected will be identified by the HCFA as they implement thisand other changes for FY 1989. Since the impact on these areas under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment systemwould be comparable to that under the Medicare PPS, we are proposing touse the same designations. Any county which is currently designated asa rural area but is redesignated as an urban area under the Medicare PPSshall also be considered to be an urban area for purposes of CHAMPUS.Hospitals located in the specified rural areas will be paid at the higherurban adjusted standardized amount (ASA) and also will benefit from thepredominantly higher metropolitan statistical area (MSA) wage indexes.This will better compensate these hospitals for the higher costs they experienceas a result of their proximity to urban areas.In adopting this provision, we are simply duplicating a change which willbe made under the Medicare PPS on which the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment systemis modeled. We believe it would be unreasonable to consider any other alternative.Just as for the Medicare PPS, CHAMPUS implementation of this provisionwill ensure that it does not result in aggregate payments to either urbanor rural hospitals which are greater or less than would otherwise be made.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Medicare Cost-To-Charge Ratio</ITAG>In calculating the adjusted standardized amounts (ASAs) used in the CHAMPUSDRG-based payment system, we have reduced the charges in the database toa cost basis by using the Medicare cost-to-charge ratio. This ratio was.66 as published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on September 3, 1986 (51 FR 31523) and was basedon FY 1984 cost and charge data. However, HCFA has now updated this cost-to-chargeratio to .6368. Since the period for this updated ratio coincides moreclosely with the period we have used for the database in calculating theCHAMPUS ASAs (July 1, 1986, through June 30, 1987), we are proposing touse it.We continue to believe that the Medicare cost-to-charge ratio is the bestmeasure of the relation of hospital costs to charges that is currentlyavailable. Because hospital's posted charges to third-party payers aregenerally consistent, this ratio provides a reasonable estimate of CHAMPUScosts relative to charges. Moreover, it represents those costs which havebeen identified, through statute and regulation, as reimbursable underMedicare, the major government program. We also believe that since ourbeneficiaries are considerably younger and generally healthier on average,the resource consumption (and therefore, costs) for a CHAMPUS beneficiarywould be less than for a Medicare beneficiary in the same DRG.When we implemented the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system last year, weused the most recently available Medicare cost-to-charge ratio of .66.This ratio was derived from FY 1984 data, but we used a database periodof July 1, 1986, through June 30, 1987. Nevertheless, this was the onlyratio available, and we were aware that the ratio had been steadily decliningfrom year to year. The cost-to-charge ratio recently calculated by HCFAbased on FY 1985 data is now .6368. Thus, the period for which it is calculatedmuch more closely corresponds to our database period.HCFA also has published the new cost-to-charge ratio on a state basis.The majority of CHAMPUS admissions are located in states with cost-to-chargeratios <T3>below </T3>the national average. For example, over 70 percent of CHAMPUSDRG admissions occur in states with urban cost-to-charge ratios below .62.Use of the .6368 simply refines our base year calculation. We did considerrebasing in order to reflect in our payment rates the new shorter lengths-of-stayand other hospital efficiencies. Because CHAMPUS paid billed charges forso long, it is our assumption that our charges reflected an ingrained inefficientprovision of care. Simply applying the Medicare cost-to-charge ratio toour charges most likely overstates appropriate costs. Nevertheless, weare proposing not to rebase at this time. We specifically invite commentson the issue of rebasing.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Alcohol/Drug Abuse Services</ITAG>When CHAMPUS implemented its DRG-based payment system on October 1, 1987,Medicare simultaneously extended its PPS to cover alcohol/drug abuse DRGs.Even so, we elected to defer coverage of alcohol/drug abuse DRGs, becausewe were not certain that the nature of alcohol/drug abuse treatment, andits classification, is comparable for both the CHAMPUS and Medicare beneficiarygroups.As proposed, since publication of our September 1, 1987, final rule, wehave examined the impact of Medicare's alcohol/drug abuse procedures onCHAMPUS beneficiaries. This evaluation was performed through a contractwith the RAND Corporation. This evaluation found that:1. With one exception discussed below, the Medicare DRGs can be used toreimburse for CHAMPUS patients;2. A large majority (more than two-thirds) of CHAMPUS discharges for alcohol/drugabuse treatment were from general acute-care hospitals;3. On average, general hospitals are reimbursed slightly more than specialtyhospitals; 4. Implementation of DRG-based reimbursement will result in no reductionin total payments for alcohol/drug abuse services.As a result of the RAND study, we are proposing to end the exemption foralcohol/drug abuse services and reimburse them under the CHAMPUS DRG-basedpayment system. This will apply to all alcohol/drug abuse services regardlessof whether they are provided in hospitals and hospital units subject toDRG-based reimbursement or in hospitals, such as psychiatric institutions,that are currently exempt from DRGs. Alcohol/drug hospitals and alcohol/drugunits (in hopsitals otherwise subject to DRG-based payments) will no longerbe exempt.We will use the same DRGs as currently used in the Medicare PPS, with oneexception. Our analysis has shown that a majority of CHAMPUS alcohol/drugabuse claims group into DRG 435 (alcohol/drug abuse or dependence, detoxificationor other symptomatic treatment, without complications or comorbidity),and that for this DRG age appears to significantly influence resource use.We found that the average charges for patients under 21 years of age wereapproximately $1,900 higher than the average charges for patients over21. Therefore, we will divide DRG 435 into two age-based DRGs (we willdesignate these as DRGs 900 and 901), which should improve the abilityof the DRG classification system to reflect differences in resource useacross patients. Since we will continue to use the Medicare Grouper, thissplit will be done by the CHAMPUS contractor (FI) after claims have beengrouped.This provision will enable CHAMPUS to incorporate a significant numberof CHAMPUS admissions into our DRG-based payment system. This will provideus with the same benefits we achieved for other types of services_namely,a way to control our costs for these services and an incentive for hospitalsto provide these services efficiently.The operational impact of this provision on acute-care hospitals will benegligible, since Medicare implemented alcohol/drug abuse DRGs for thesehospitals last year. Although a number of specialty hospitals have notpreviously been subject to DRG-based reimbursement, we believe there isno justification for continuing to differentiate them in the payment forthese services.The relative weights we use for these services will reflect the treatmentpatterns and resource use among CHAMPUS patients. It is for just this reason,that we have decided to split DRG 435 into two age-based DRGs.We are aware that many of the specialty hospitals (alcohol/drug abuse,psychiatric, rehabilitation, and long-term) which treat CHAMPUS beneficiariesare not Medicare-participating providers. Since the participation linkagediscussed in our September 1, 1987, final rule would not apply to thosehospitals which are not Medicare-participating, they will be required tocomplete the Health Program Benefit Agreement contained in that final rule.By completing this agreement, hospitals agree to accept the CHAMPUS-determinedallowable amount as payment in full for their services. The CHAMPUS-determinedallowable amount will be based on the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment systemfor services subject to this system and on the hospital's billed charges(as described in the CHAMPUS regulation) for services exempt from the CHAMPUSDRG-based payment system. Completed agreements are to be sent to the hospital'sCHAMPUS FI, and a representative of the FI will sign and return a copyof the agreement. Just as for all other hospitals, any specialty hospitalwhich is not Medicare-participating and which fails to complete the HealthProgram Benefit Agreement will no longer be an authorized CHAMPUS provideras of October 1, 1988. These agreements will be completed only upon requestof the hospital to the CHAMPUS contractor.We recognize that some hospitals which are not Medicare-participating hospitalsmay elect not to sign a participation agreement with CHAMPUS as a resultof our implementation of the alcohol/drug abuse DRGs. In light of the relativelysmall number of hospitals which provide these services to more than a veryfew CHAMPUS beneficiaries, we expect the number of hospitals deciding notto sign agreements will be extremely small. Moreover, we believe that alternatesources of care will be available for beneficiaries in areas of any hospitalswhich choose not to sign a participation agreement. Should no alternativesource be available in a 50-mile radius, we will consider an alcohol/drugabuse treatment hospital as if it were a sole community provider and exemptit from the DRG system.Because of the number in which DRG-based payments are determined, it isimpractical to place a limit on the number of covered days for a servicesubject to DRG-based reimbursement. Moreover, since implementation of DRG-basedreimbursement for alcohol/drug abuse services provided by hospitals willeliminate length-of-stay as a determinant of payment, we are eliminatingthe current limits on individual stays for alcoholism. Currently, treatmentof alcoholism is limited to seven days detoxification per stay and twenty-onedays of rehabilitation. The lifetime limit for rehabilitation is unchanged,and the benefit period limitation is revised to one stay per benefit period,as opposed to twenty-one days per benefit period. We want to emphasizethat these changes apply only to inpatient hospital services subject tothe DRG-based payment system, and that we don't intend this to be a changeto the benefit but rather a change to the procedures for applying the benefit.In implementing these changes we are not making any distinction betweenalcohol abuse and drug abuse services. They are treated identically underthe Medicare PPS, and we have found no justification in our studies todo any differently.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Children's Hospitals</ITAG>Last year we deferred coverage of children's hospitals by the CHAMPUS DRG-basedpayment system. We received a number of comments on our June 3, 1987, proposedrule which contended that the DRG classification system and the paymentlevels do not adequately distinguish the more complex and resource intensivechildren's conditions which are treated by children's hospitals. At thetime, we examined CHAMPUS data relating to charges of children's hospitalsand found some plausible support for this contention. Accordingly, we deferredcoverage of children's hospitals, noting that we intended to review thisarea ``so that children's hospitals can be incorporated into our DRG systemin the future.''We have subsequently had several meetings with interested organizationsincluding NACHRI, and, under a contract with the Department of Defense,the RAND Corporation has analyzed the implementation of DRG-based paymentsfor children's hospitals. RAND's findings include:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The proportion of day outliers in children's hospitals is not significantlydifferent from that for pediatric services in other hospitals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Use of the CDRGs (exclusive of the neonate CDRGs) provides littleimprovement over the current DRGs as a predictor of resource use.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Notwithstanding the above findings, the charges of children's hospitalsare consistently higher than the charges for other hospitals for similarservices.</ITAG>In light of the above findings and our discussions with NACHRI, the differencein charges may be a result of two factors: (1) Children's hospitals, althoughthey treat patients generally grouped into the same DRGs as other hospitals,may treat sicker patients on average, and (2) children's hospitals cannotshift some of their costs to less costly adult care as may occur in otherhospitals.We considered recognizing these higher costs by calculating a separateASA for childrens' hospitals derived by applying the cost-to-charge ratio(currently .66) to the higher childrens' hospitals' charges. This methodwould recognize the possibility that childrens' hospitals treat sickerpatients. It would not, however, recognize the possibility that generalhospitals cross-subsidize pediatric care with adult patients while childrens'hospitals cannot. There is no empirical evidence to support or refute thispremise. However, we are proposing, for now, to assume it is true for purposesof developing payment rates for childrens' hospitals. To assure full consideration,we invite comments on the possible alternative approach of applying thecost-to-charge ratio to a separately-calculated childrens' hospital ASA.We are proposing that children's hospitals be subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-basedpayment system using the CHAMPUS DRGs, but in order to fully recognizetheir higher costs, we will develop a ``children's hospital differential''.The differential will be a predetermined amount which will be multipliedby the appropriate DRG relative weight and added to each DRG-based paymentmade to children's hospitals.The differential will be equal to the difference between a specially calculatedASA for children's hospitals (using standard procedures but based on adatabase of only children's hospitals) and the ASA which would otherwisebe applicable. It will be calculated so that it is ``revenue neutral''for children's hospitals; that is, for the base year overall CHAMPUS paymentsto children's hospitals under the DRG-based payment system will be equalto those under the old payment system. To accomplish this we will calculatea separate ASA for childrens' hospitals using the same database as forother calculations (July 1, 1989, through June 30, 1987). Normally in calculatingASAs, we reduce the adjusted charges according to the Medicare cost-to-chargeratio (currently .66). However, in recognition of the higher costs of children'shospitals, we will not use this step in calculating the children's hospitaldifferential. We will subtract the appropriate ASA from this children'shospital ASA, and this amount will be the children's hospital differential.There will actually be two differentials used_one for children's hospitalsin large urban areas and one for children's hospitals in other urban areas(there are no children's hospitals in rural areas). The differentials willnot be subject to annual inflation updates. Of course, the normal ASAswill be updated annually according to the Medicare increase, so children'shospitals will benefit from these increases just as all other hospitalsbenefit from them.NACHRI has also commented that each childrens' hospital is so unique thatthey require hospital-specific rates. Analysis of the variation among childrens'hospitals indicates that, in general, the variation is no greater for childrens'hospitals than among large teaching hospitals. There is no justificationfor special treatment in this regard.In addition, the vast majority of CHAMPUS claims from childrens' hospitalsis concentrated in only a very few hospitals. Thus, the children's hospitaldifferential will essentially be derived from charge data from those fewhospitals which receive a significant amount of CHAMPUS reimbursement,and it will, in effect, be specific to them.Just as for alcohol/drug abuse hospitals, we recognize that some children'shospitals may not be Medicare-participating providers. Those which arenot must complete the Health Program Benefit Agreement in order to be authorizedCHAMPUS providers. If they do not, they will no longer be authorized CHAMPUSproviders as of October 1, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Neonate Services</ITAG>When the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system was implemented on October 1,1987, neonatal services were included in it. It was our position, basedon an examination of CHAMPUS data, that the impact of DRGs on neonate serviceswould occur primarily at children's hospitals which were exempt. We foundthat the impact on other hospitals would be similar to the impact of otherDRGs.However Pub. L. 100-202, the 1988 Department of Defense AppropriationsAct, required that discharges involving newborns and infants who are lessthan 29 days old upon admission (other than discharges classified to diagnosisrelated group 391) be exempt from our DRG-based payment system. This provisionhas been implemented and was included in a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice published on March 1, 1988.Based on our abbreviated experience with payment based on the existingneonate DRGs and on our discussions with NACHRI, we believe neonate servicescan be equitably included in the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. We areproposing that neonate services be reimbursed using the Pediatric ModifiedDRGs (PMDRG) that differentiate the DRG by birthweight. These PMDRGs weredeveloped by NACHRI. A number of studies have shown that birthweight isa strong predictor of both hospital charges and length-of-stay. The PMDRGs,which are considerably more extensive than the current six neonate DRGsand include divisions based on birthweight, will much more accurately classifyneonate admissions.Because the CHAMPUS data do not now contain birthweight information, wewill be using the relative weights for each birthweight category withina neonatal DRG from another large, comparable database. The overall weightfor the neonatal DRGs will still be derived from CHAMPUS claims data.We believe that this classification change, together with the new ``childrens'hospital differential'' and the increased payment for high-cost outliersproposed below, should substantially reduce or eliminate any adverse fiscalimpacts on hospitals resulting from covering neonates in the DRG-basedpayment system. We invite comment on whether or not additional changesto the outlier policy specific to neonates, are appropriate to assure adequatepayment.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Outliers</ITAG>The CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system includes provisions for making outlierpayments. That is, an adjustment is made to the DRG-based payment amountfor those cases that have either an unusually short length-of-stay or extremelylong length-of-stay or that involve extraordinarily high costs when comparedto most discharges classified into the same DRG. Such outlier paymentsare particularly important for CHAMPUS, since the number of CHAMPUS casesin many hospitals is relatively small, and there may not be an opportunityto ``average out'' DRG-based payments over a number of claims.For the most part, our outlier policy follows the outlier procedures usedin the Medicare PPS. In their proposed rule published in May 1988, HCFAproposes to change the procedures for reimbursing outliers, and CHAMPUSwill make similar changes.The Medicare analysis indicates that while our payment policy for outlierseffectively reduces the risk faced by hospitals in treating cases thatare outside the normal range of cases in terms of duration or costliness,additional compensation would be justified for the most expensive cases,particularly those long-stay cases with extremely high costs. On the otherhand, some cases that currently qualify for additional payment as day outliersare not extraordinarily costly.The Medicare research has shown that a higher marginal cost factor wouldresult in more appropriate payments for the most expensive cases, by moreeffectively reducing the financial risk to hospitals that is associatedwith these cases. In particular, they note that the estimated loss percase is higher for cost outliers than for day outliers. When day outliersare separated into two categories_those exceeding the length-of-stay thresholdbut not the cost threshold, and those exceeding both thresholds_the estimatedloss per case for the more expensive day outliers (those also exceedingthe cost threshold) substantially exceeds that for the less expensive dayoutliers (those that do not exceed the cost threshold).This finding that the financial risk associated with outlier cases variessubstantially depending on whether the case is long stay only or the casealso exceeds the cost threshold suggests that the marginal cost factorbeing used for the most expensive outliers (those that exceed the costoutlier threshold) is too low.Accordingly, for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1988, Medicareis proposing to set the marginal cost factor for the most expensive outliercases (that is, all outlier cases exceeding the cost outlier threshold)at 80 percent of adjusted charges beyond the cost outlier threshold. Basedon the Medicare research to date, they believe that this revised marginalcost factor would result in more accurate payment for the marginal costof cost outliers and more adequate compensation to hospitals treating themost costly outlier cases.In addition, we currently pay even the most expensive day outliers at aper diem amount that is based on the average payment for all dischargesassigned to that DRG. For some of the cases that currently qualify as dayoutliers, the per diem rate paid does not adequately compensate the hospitalfor its marginal costs. This is especially true for day outlier cases withextremely high costs, for which the daily costs may vastly exceed the dayoutlier per diem and for which that daily difference is multiplied by along length-of-stay.We are proposing that the percentage payment for cost outliers be increasedfrom 60 percent to 80 percent, and that cases which qualify as both a dayoutlier and a cost outlier will be paid at whichever outlier results inthe greatest payment. Our methodology for calculating the long-stay andcost outlier cutoffs will continue to duplicate that used in the MedicarePPS.We are not proposing to adopt the hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratioproposed by Medicare for purposes of computing cost outlier payments. UnlikeMedicare, we believe use of a national cost-to-charge ratio is more appropriatefor our beneficiaries. We have examined the state cost-to-charge ratioscalculated by HCFA, and we find that for the states in which most of ourbeneficiaries are concentrated the national cost-to-charge ratio is consistentlyhigher. Thus, on average, we believe use of anything other than the nationalcost-to-charge ratio would actually reduce cost-outlier payments.<ITAG tagnum="84">X. Burn Outliers</ITAG>As a result of a statutory change (Section 4008(d)(1)(A) of Pub. L. 100-203),the outlier policy for those DRGs related to burn cases has been changedfor Medicare. Therefore, we are proposing that for the DRGs relating toburn cases, the marginal cost factor for both long-stay and cost outlierbe increased to 90 percent. There are six DRGs related to burn cases whichare affected by this change. They are:<ITAG tagnum="15">456_Burns, transferred to another acute care facility.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">457_Extensive burn w/o O.R. procedure</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">458_Non-extensive burns with skin graft</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">459_Non-extensive burns with wound debridement or other O.R. procedure</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">460_Non-extensive burns w/o O.R. procedure</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">472_Extensive burns with O.R. procedure</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">XI. Other Minor Changes and Clarifications to the Existing Procedures</ITAG>A. Grouper ProgramThe final rule which we published on September 1, 1987, requires that theCHAMPUS DRG-based payment system use the most recently available Grouperfor the Medicare PPS. When our DRG-based payment system was developed andimplemented, the FY 1987 Medicare Grouper was the only program availableto use. When the HCFA introduced an updated Grouper_a FY 1988 version_webegan to receive complaints, because our Grouper was different from Medicare's.As a result, we recalculated the weights and rates necessary for the FY1988 Medicare Grouper, and we implemented it for discharges occurring onor after March 1, 1988. We are proposing to use the FY 1988 Medicare Grouperbeginning October 1, 1988. Of course, this will depend upon its availabilityin time for use to complete the necessary calculations, such as the updatedweights, the weights for alcohol/drug abuse DRGs, and the revised ASAswhich recognize large urban areas.Use of the updated Grouper will mean that we are also adopting the DRGreclassification changes which HCFA has proposed in their recently-publishedproposed rule. This includes the changes to the major diagnostic categories,the surgical heirarchies, the list of complications and comorbidities,and the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, ClinicalModification (ICD-9-CM). We will also use the two new DRGs (476 and 477)proposed by HCFA. All of these changes are discussed in detail in HCFA'sproposed rule.B. <T3>ASA Update Factor</T3>In order to update the ASAs for FY 1989, we are proposing to use the samefactors used for the Medicare PPS. These factors are the market basketpercentage increase minus 1.5 percent for hospitals located in rural areas,the market basket percentage increase minus 2.0 percent for hospitals locatedin large urban areas, and the market basket percentage increase minus 2.5percent for hospitals located in other urban areas.C. <T3>Indirect Medical Education Adjustment Factor</T3>The CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system provides for an adjustment factorto be calculated for teaching hospitals in order to compensate them forindirect medical education costs. These hospital-specific factors are calculatedin accordance with Medicare procedures, although the factors themselvesare not the same as under Medicare, since we use different base data. Also,since CHAMPUS has no disproportionate share provision, we have calculatedthe adjustment factor using the formula for Medicare which is to be effectiveas of October 1, 1989. This formula results in a higher factor than wouldotherwise be calculated.We intend to continue using the higher Medicare formula, but section 4003(a)(1)of Pub. L. 100-203 revised the formulas used under the Medicare PPS. Aswe stated in last year's final rule (52 FR 32999), CHAMPUS will reviseits formula in accordance with any statutory change in the Medicare formula.Therefore, we are proposing to use the following formula for calculatingthe indirect medical education adjustment factor.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,5,4,27,2,9</C> <H1>1.43andmultiply; </H1><T4>T</T4><T4>A</T4><H1>1.0+</H1><H1>number of interns+residents</H1><H2>number of beds</H2><H1/><T4>B</T4><H1/>.5795^1.0<T4>U</T4><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>The new formula will be used beginning with all submissions of hospitals'requests for payment for capital and direct medical education costs receivedby CHAMPUS contractors after October 1, 1988.D. Per Diem Cost-Sharing Amount for Beneficiaries Other than Dependentsof Active-Duty MembersWhen we implemented the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system we simultaneouslymodified the cost-sharing procedures for beneficiaries other than dependentsof active-duty members. Prior to that time, these beneficiaries' cost-sharewas simply twenty-five percent of the CHAMPUS determined allowable amount,in accordance with the CHAMPUS statute. With implementation of the DRG-basedpayment system, we revised the procedures for calculating the cost-shareto be the lesser of a per diem amount ($175) or twenty-five percent ofthe billed charge. The per diem amount was calculated so that total cost-sharingamounts for these beneficiaries would be equivalent to twenty-five percentof the DRG-based payments for hospital services. By doing this we not onlycomplied with the statutory requirement that cost-shares be twenty-fivepercent, but, more importantly, we ensured that no beneficiary would berequired to pay a cost-share under our DRG-based payment system that isgreater than the cost-share which would have been required if the DRG-basedpayment system had not been implemented.In calculating the cost-sharing per diem for FY 1989, we intend to followthe same procedures with one additional element. Our calculations lastyear did not include any consideration for the year-end payments for capitaland direct medical education costs which CHAMPUS will pay. Since thesecosts previously would have been included in the hospitals' charges, beneficiarycost-shares would also have included a portion of them. Accordingly, toconform more closely to the requirements of the statute, we propose toinclude these costs in our calculation of the cost-sharing per diem forFY 1989.E. Submission of Request for Payment for Capital and Direct Medical EducationCostsThe CHAMPUS regulation currently requires that hospitals submit their requestfor payment of capital and direct medical education costs within threemonths of the end of the hospital's Medicare cost-reporting period. Thisrequirement has often proven to be impossible for hospitals, because theyare granted an extension to the cost-report filing deadline by HCFA. Sincepart of the data reported to CHAMPUS is derived directly from the Medicarecost-report, hospitals have been unable to meet CHAMPUS' deadline. We haverecognized this problem and have not enforced the deadline.We are proposing that this requirement be eliminated, because it servesno useful purpose for CHAMPUS. It is in the best interests of the hospitalto submit the report at the earliest possible time, since no payment forcapital and direct medical education costs can be made until the reportis received by the CHAMPUS FI. Moreover, for teaching hospitals, the indirectmedical education factor cannot be updated until the report is received.However, if the report is submitted late or even not at all, there is noadverse impact on CHAMPUS.F. Clarification of Total Inpatient Days and CHAMPUS Inpatient DaysThe CHAMPUS regulations requires that a hospital's request for paymentof capital and direct medical education costs include ``total impatientdays provided'' and ``total CHAMPUS inpatient days for those beneficiariessubject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system provided.'' Customarily,regulation requirements, which are often brief, are expanded and clarifiedin various manual instructions. Accordingly, these two items have beenfurther defined in CHAMPUS manual instructions as ``total inpatient daysprovided to all patients in units subject to DRG-based payment'' and ``totalCHAMPUS inpatient days provided in units subject to DRG-based payment.(This is to be only days which were allowed for payment. Therefore, dayswhich were paid entirely by other health insurance or which were determinedto be not medically necessary are not to be included.)'' This is to ensurethat only days provided in units subject to DRG-based payment are reported.These instructions, just as other manual instructions, have been disseminatedto hospitals through the normal operations of our contractors. Nevertheless,we are proposing that, to ensure clarity of these requirements, the regulatoryrequirements be expanded to be more comparable to our existing manual instructions.G. Percentage Reductions in Capital PaymentsUnder the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, CHAMPUS will make annual paymentsto hospitals to reimburse them for CHAMPUS' share of each hospital's capitalcosts. These payments are made only upon request and are based on datasubmitted in the hospital's Medicare cost-report. The final rule whichimplemented our DRG-based payment system stated that, ``Reductions in paymentsfor capital costs which are required under Medicare shall also be appliedto payments for capital costs under CHAMPUS.''Section 4006(a) of Pub. L. 100-203 set forth percentage reductions to bemade in capital payments under the Medicare PPS. In accordance with thosereductions, the basic capital payments under the CHAMPUS DRG-based paymentsystem shall be reduced by seven percent for any payments made for daysbetween October 1 and December 31, 1987; by 12 percent for any paymentsmade for days between January 1 and September 30, 1988; and by 15 percentfor payments made for days during FY 1989. CHAMPUS capital payments willbe prorated for the different percentage reductions based on the numberof days in the reporting period which fall into each category.Since last year's final rule provided for using these reductions, theyhave already been implemented for CHAMPUS. This information is providedonly to clarify how we are applying the reductions.H. Wage IndexThe area wage indexes to be used for FY 1989 for the CHAMPUS DRG-basedpayment system are those used under the Medicare PPS as published in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>in May 1988.I. Payment for Hospital-Based Professional and Nurse Anesthestist ServicesThe services of hospital-based professionals and nurse anesthetists areexempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. As we stated in lastyear's proposed rule, they are to be reimbursed using the allowable chargemethodology. Although we made the necessary changes to the regulation toimplement this policy, we believe the cross-reference in andSection; 199.14,paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C) is misleading and we are correcting it.<ITAG tagnum="84">XII. Mental Health Services</ITAG>Under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, we have exempted all serviceswhich would otherwise be paid under one of the psychiatric DRGs which arenumbers 424-432. In addition, we have exempted psychiatric hospsitals andpsychiatric units. With the exception of alcohol/drug abuse cases in them,these hospitals and units, as well as all mental health services will continueto be exempt from our DRG-based payment system. However, we have developedan alternative payment system for these services, and we are publishinga Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on it as well.<ITAG tagnum="84">XIII. Other Required Information </ITAG>A. Effective DateThe procedures contained in this proposed rule are to be applicable toall discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1988.B. Paperwork Reduction ActThis notice does not impose information collection requirements. Therefore,it does not need to be reviewed by the Executive Office of Management andBudget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.3501-3511).C. Coordination of Proposed RuleThis amendment is being published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>for proposed rulemaking at the same time it isbeing coordinated within the Department of Defense and with other interestedagencies so that consideration of both internal and external comments andpublication of the final rule can be expedited.<ITAG tagnum="84">XIV. Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Executive Order 12291 requires that a regulatory impact analysis be performedon any major rule. A ``major rule'' is defined as one which would: Result in annual effect on the national economy of $100 million or more;Result in a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, any industries,any government agencies, or any geographic regions; or Have significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation or on the ability of U.S.-based enterprises tocompete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or import markets.The Regulatory Flexibility Act (FRA) requires that each federal agencyprepare, and make available for public comment, a regulatory flexibilityanalysis when the agency issues regulations which would have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, we consider small entities to include many nonproft andfor-profit hospitals.Under both the Executive Order and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, suchanalyses must, when prepared, examine regulatory alternatives which minimizeunnecessary burden or otherwise assure that regulations are cost-effective.We do not consider this proposed rule to be a major rule under ExecutiveOrder 12291. Moreover, this rule will not significantly affect a substantialnumber of small entities. The proposed changes set forth in this proposedrule, taken as a whole, would have a annual impact on the hospital industryof substantially less than $100 million. Additionally, the economic impact,which is solely a function of revised federal payments, on almost all individualhospitals is very little in view of the small percentage of hospital revenueprovided by CHAMPUS and the small change in CHAMPUS payments representedby this proposed rule. Therefore, no regulatory impact analysis is required. Nonetheless, throughoutthe preamble, we have provided information to permit a thorough assessmentof all effects of the rule. We welcome comments and factual informationthat would facilitate additional analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 199</ITAG>Claims, Handicapped, Health insurance, Military personnel.Accordingly, 32 CFR Part 199 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 199_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
