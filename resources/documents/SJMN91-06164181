WilliamSeidman said at a news conference.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CALIFORNIA BANKS HIT 'WARNING AREA'STATE'S TROUBLED LOANS JUMPED 44%  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The boom-and-bust cycle is familiar to residents of Texas, Arizona andMassachusetts, who saw price jumps of 15 percent or 20 percent a year duringthe mid-1980s turn into steep price declines in recent years. But the hotCalifornia market, while slowing down, was still far stronger than the rest ofthe United States.;    California's advantage is now slipping, however,according to the FDIC's latest study of bank performance.;    Bank holdings oftroubled real estate, just 2.96 percent of assets at the end of last year,jumped to 4.24 percent during the first quarter this year, an increase of 44percent. Other states breaking the 4 percent barrier were Illinois, Ohio,North Carolina and Missouri.;    Regulatory officials consider a level oftroubled real estate loans below 4 percent as acceptable for normal businessactivity. But they begin to worry that the weakness is becoming widespreadwhen the combined rate for overdue loans and real estate owned throughforeclosures goes above 4 percent of the banks' total real estate loanactivity.;    California's banking industry is still in better shape than theoverall national system, in which 7.38 percent of real estate loans are listedas being in financial trouble. Real estate is in an outright depression in NewEngland, where troubled loans account for 17 percent of the real estate assetsof Massachusetts banks and 16 percent in Connecticut. Texas, recovering afterseven years of depressed real estate prices, has a troubled loan rate of 11percent.;    Seidman said that there was &quot;no indication California will havethe (severe) depth of problems that Texas and New England had.&quot; For example,more than 22 percent of the construction loans granted by northeast banks arebehind on their payments. Builders and developers, struggling in a market witha high vacancy rate, are finding it difficult to find tenants for newprojects.;    Real estate problems are dragging down the performance of U.S.banks, which had net income of $5.7 billion during the first quarter, downfrom the $6.2 billion earned in the first quarter a year ago, the FDIC reportsays.;    In California, the banks' net income plunged to $753 million duringthe quarter, down from $1.1 billion a year ago.;    The banking businesschanged dramatically in the 1980s as many traditional customers, such as bigcorporate borrowers, went to Wall Street to raise money through the sale ofcommercial paper. And many retail customers were lost to other lenders, suchas automobile finance companies that offered to handle car loans. Banks turnedincreasingly to real estate lending, now the biggest single source ofbusiness.;    Banks held real estate loans totaling $836.1 billion in thefirst quarter, up 7.5 percent from $777.6 billion a year ago. Thesecond-biggest category of business, commercial and industrial loans, fell to$606.4 billion, down from $623.1 billion a year ago.;    The persistence ofthe recession, which will be a year old next month, has increased the cost ofdisposing of failed banks and savings and loan associations. More financialinstitutions will become insolvent and be seized by the government, Seidmansaid.;    Comptroller General Charles Bowsher said Tuesday that the cost ofthe savings and loan bailout would be much higher than previous administrationestimates.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ROBERT A.
