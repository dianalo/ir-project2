As previously reported, General Electric will provide engines for Wardair of Canada to power 12 Airbus Industrie twin-engine planes that the Canadian charter airline is purchasing. The order includes spare parts. The aircraft are scheduled for delivery from November 1987 through December 1988, GE said.    Also, GE said its turbine business signed a $75 million contract with Egypt's electrical authority to convert a gas, turbine-powered generating station into the country's first combined-cycle power plant.    GE said the conversion would be completed in 1989. It said the U.S. Agency for International Development has allocated $65 million for the project, with remaining funds provided by the Egyptian government.    GE is an electrical equipment maker, with interests in broadcasting and financial services. </TEXT></DOC>
