In that case, rail employees could observe Eastern employees'picket lines. Here are answers to some questions raised by the case:   Q. Why could rail passengers be affected by an airline strike?   A. Because Eastern's unions hope to bring pressure to bear on theairline and the government by extending the strike to other forms oftransportation.   Q. But isn't such a tactic _ a secondary boycott _ illegal underthe Taft-Hartley Act of 1947?   A. Yes, but the railroad and airline unions are covered by theRailway Labor Act of 1926, not Taft-Hartley.   Q. Why are those unions outside the main body of laborlegislation?   A. Because in the 1920s the railroads had unparalleled power,wealth and political influence, and because their pay and mediationpractices were different from everyone else's.   Q. But why are airlines covered by the Railway Act?   A. When Congress amended the Railway Act in 1934, the unions ofthe fledgling airline industry lobbied to be included. Congress wentalong, although it may not have realized at the time how soonairlines would dwarf railroads in importance. Transportation unionsin other industries, such as trucks and buses, are covered by theWagner Act of 1935, which Taft-Hartley amended.   Q. Why wouldn't Congress extend its policy against secondaryboycotts to the Railway Act?   A. The railway unions had much more political power immediatelyafter World War II than they do today, so amending the act wouldhave been problematic. The Railway Act, moreover, represented acompromise worked out by management and labor specifically for theirindustry; Congress was reluctant to tamper with it.   Q. How have other secondary boycotts turned out?   A. Until 1947 they were one of organized labor's most potentweapons. The few secondary boycotts that have occurred since havebeen brief; either the president stepped in and imposed acooling-off period, or judges stopped them, citing the publicwelfare.   Q. What commuter rail lines might be struck if the judge does notbar a sympathy strike?   A. Twelve commuter lines, in addition to Amtrak, could be shutdown. They are the Long Island Rail Road; the Metro-North CommuterRailroad; New Jersey Transit; Port Authority Trans-Hudson, or PATH;the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority; the Northern IndianaCommuter Transportation District; the Maryland TransportationAuthority of Baltimore and suburban Washington; the SoutheasternPennsylvania Transportation Authority; the Rapid Transit Authorityin Chicago; CalTrans, which operates between San Francisco and SanJose; the Port Authority of Allegheny County in Pittsburgh; andTri-Rail, southern Florida's new 67-mile rail system.   Q. Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road are owned by theMetropolitan Transportation Authority, a creature of the state ofNew York. So why aren't the railroad employees governed by thestate's Taylor Law, which prohibits strikes by public employees?   A. The Supreme Court has ruled that those workers are covered bythe Railway Act, which preceded the Taylor Law.   Q. Why has U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson issued aninjuncton against the secondary boycott? Doesn't the Norris-LaGuardia Act bar such action by the federal judiciary in labordisputes?   A. There is an exception for cross-industry secondary boycottsand strikes, reflecting Congress's conviction that labor battles,including strikes, should be restricted to unions and companies inthe same industry.   Q. But since Eastern and the railroads are all covered by thesame labor legislation, aren't they in the same industry?   A. That's for the courts to say.</TEXT></DOC>
