It is an option frequently ignored, except by taxpayers, who arewidely accused of wanting lower taxes while simultaneously refusingto accept cuts in Medicare, Social Security and similar benefits.   But it is probably more accurate to ascribe to voters a logicalgoal, that of cutting wasteful spending, rather than thecontradictory policy of which they have been accused, that of lowertaxes and more spending.   There is hardly a family that doesn't understand the need forcutting, especially today. With recession coming, if not here, andwith unemployment rising, they have been forced to retrench andlive within their incomes.   Industry has been forced to do the same, to the extent that``downsizing'' has become a fad word in the business lexicon. Evenphilanthropic groups have felt the pinch and have reluctantlylimited their goals.   The same has been asked of government but seldom is there ananswer.   In 1984, the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control,popularly called the Grace Commission after its chairman, J. PeterGrace, recommended $424 billion in cuts over a three-year period.   Last November, the General Accounting Office found $150 billionin program waste, fraud and financial mismanagement. Last spring,the Congressional Budget Office recommended reforms to yieldsavings of $60 billion in the first year.   As recently as last May the Heritage Foundation, a conservativethink tank, offered a list of $130 billion in cuts that itsresearchers said would cause minimal damage.   Some idea of why such cuts aren't made came from that latestanalysis, by Scott Hodge, federal budget analyst for thefoundation. He would ask Congress to break an addiction todeceptive, often deceitful porkbarrel spending.   To an aid packgge earlier this year for Panama and Nicaragua,for example, members of Congress tacked on their own specialinterest expenditures for local, domestic projects that had nothingto do with national interests.   Hodge and his researchers cite examples of ``harmless''expenditures, such as financing a study of the causes of rudeness,lying and cheating on tennis courts and one seeking to determinewhy people fall in love.   Harmless? In themselves, perhaps so, but not in the damaginglesson they send, that spending is in and saving is out, and thatmisusing other people's money is acceptable so long as they remainunaware of it.   Besides, as members of Congress themselves concede, a littlespending oft repeated adds up to a lot. That ``lot'' can beespecially crucial to the economy in a recession attended byunemployment and bankruptcies.   Americans have been made especially aware of tax dangers fromthe lips of President Bush, whose comments have included thestatement that ``when the government raises a dollar in revenues,Congress spends a dollar fifty.''   Perhaps, critics of waste are saying, voters aren't refusing toaccept the pain of an austerity budget so much as they are tryingto tell Congress that it must use public money wisely, honestly andwith restraint.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Tuesday, Oct. 9</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
