A spokesman for the central bank said it will end its role when the current pact expires Sept. 30. It is expected to be succeeded by a new accord between the Swiss Bankers Association and the Swiss Banking Commission, a government watchdog agency.    The spokesman, noting that a revision of Swiss banking law sought by the national bank has been postponed, said, &quot;We think (the agreement) is the best that can be achieved at this time.&quot;    Under the current code, most persons opening a Swiss bank account must identify any clients they may be acting for and promise they won't help the clients evade their home country's laws. No other country has such a code.    But a loophole in the code allowed lawyers and accountants to open accounts for unidentified customers, on grounds of professional secrecy. The new self-regulatory agreement tightens the procedure to ban lawyers and accountants from acting as middlemen for funds that are linked to illegal activities. Violators can be fined as much as $6.8 million.    The new accord will be presented to banks next month for their approval. Carlo Mati, an official of the Swiss Bankers Association, said banks' initial reaction has been generally favorable. </TEXT></DOC>
