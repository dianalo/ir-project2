Guerrilla leaders, after meeting with Soviet Deputy ForeignMinister Yuli Vorontsov, said they believed Soviet troops will stickto their deadline and pull out of Afghanistan by Feb. 15.   ``They confirmed this,'' said Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, a guerrillaleader.   But guerrilla leaders said the sides still could not agree on thegovernment that would be left behind once the Red Army ends itsdecade-long occupation.   Mojaddidi, chairman of a loose alliance of seven Pakistan-basedguerrilla groups, said the only agreement that came out of Friday'stalks was ``that we will continue the negotiations after a fewdays.''   Moscow sent more than 100,000 soldiers into Afghanistan in 1979to replace the faltering communist government with a new one. Troopsremained to quell the anti-communist insurgency.   Under a U.N.-brokered accord reached in April, Moscow agreed toend its occupation by mid-February. It said half of its troops hadleft by August.   Vorontsov told reporters when he arrived in Islamabad onWednesday that the withdrawal deadline could be delayed if Mosleminsurgents continued fighting.   ``They asked for a cease-fire several times but we said acease-fire is not possible,'' said Mojaddidi. ``But we said we canstop attacking your military forces when they are leavingAfghanistan.''   He said the sides also reached an impasse on the role of Kabul'sMarxist People's Democratic Party of Afghansitan.   Despite rebel demands that Moscow stop insisting that the rulingCommunists play a role in a postwar government, Vorontsov continuedto press for party representation, Mojaddidi said.   ``They want the present regime to participate in the futuregovernment,'' said Mojaddidi. ``But we can't.''   Guerrilla factions based in Pakistan and Iran agreed beforeFriday's talks that Afghanistan's President Najib and his Marxistparty were a stumbling block to peace in Afghanistan.   Vorontsov refused comment on the talks. He has scheduled a pressconference for Saturday, the final day of his four-day trip. He isto meet Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan on Saturday.   The Soviet envoy also is to meet with Pakistan Foreign MinisterSahabzada Yaqub Khan Friday night at a Soviet-sponsored dinner. TheSoviet Union has said that Pakistan's ardent support for theguerrillas has worsened the prospects for peace in Afghanistan.   A Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesman, speaking on condition henot be identified, said Pakistan wants to make clear to the Sovietsthat there will be a transfer of power in Afghanistan following thefinal troop withdrawal regardless of political agreements.   Whether it is peaceful depends on whether the Soviet Union isprepared to accept the demise of the Afghan communist party, he said.   The first round of direct talks between Afghan guerrilla fightersand the Soviet Union was held Dec. 3-5 in the Saudi Arabian resortcity of Taif.   The Kremlin has stepped up its political maneuvering for apeaceful settlement to the Afghan war, shuttling Vorontsov betweenPakistan and Iran, where more than 5 million war refugees live, andRome, where the former Afghan King Zahir Shah lives.   About 17 percent of Afghanistan's 15 million people belong to theShiite sect of Islam, which is practiced by most Iranians as well.The majority of Afghans are Sunni Moslems, like the Pakistan-basedguerrillas.   The guerrillas announced Tuesday that a council will beestablished within weeks to select a transitional government. Eachof the seven parties is to nominate 60 members to this council.   The Iranian-based Afghan fighters also were asked to name 60members. A spokesman for the Shiite fighters, Timurpur, said theguerrillas in Iran have not decided to participate in this council.   Mojaddidi said Vorontsov accepted the council but ``the councilfor them is another thing ... They think the regime willparticipate. But we said only Moslem elements could participate, notnon-Moslems.''</TEXT></DOC>
