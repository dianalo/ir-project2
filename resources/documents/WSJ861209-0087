McCoyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/09/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CCI WU </IN><DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Citicorp started another new business, launching a high-speed electronic money transfer system for consumers and small businesses.    Robert Terkhorn, head of Citicorp's Chicago-based Citicorp Global Payment Products unit, said the new service will enable consumers and small businesses to transfer money around the clock anywhere in the U.S. within about 15 minutes. He said Citicorp expects to provide the service internationally by late 1987. New York-based Citicorp will spend $10 million over the next six months to market and promote the new service.    Money transfer services typically have been used only in emergencies -- to wire cash to people who suddenly find themselves broke, for example. Western Union Corp., the ailing telecommunications concern, dominates the business right now, particularly among consumers. No other major banks provide the service to consumers and small businesses, Mr. Terkhorn said.    Mr. Terkhorn said fund transfers for consumers and small businesses are generating about $250 million of commissions a year on volume of $3 billion annually, industry-wide. But he said that volume could triple within the next five or six years, in part because of Citicorp's presence. &quot;We think that by providing a good service at lower costs, consumers and businesses will find new uses for money transfer systems,&quot; Mr. Terkhorn said.    Citicorp expects to pry into the business by pricing its service at about 20% less than competitors and offering incentives to the network of agents who execute such transfers. Mr. Terkhorn said the new venture should show a profit within two years.    Citicorp's move could be more bad news for Western Union, which had a net loss of more than $71 million for the nine months, on top of a 1985 net loss of more than $367 million. It has an agreement with a group of investors to sell them a controlling interest in the company, but only if Western Union can complete a difficult restructuring. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Western Union fell 12.5 cents to close at $4.125 a share.    Edward J. Fuhrman, Western Union's senior vice president for consumer services, said the company expects to expand its own money transfer system. &quot;Citicorp is coming in with a lot of hullabaloo . . . and deep pockets, but we pioneered this business and we remain confident that we have the resources and the infrastructure&quot; to withstand competition from Citicorp, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
