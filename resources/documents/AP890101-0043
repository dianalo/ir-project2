The information was provided by the Natural Resources DefenseCouncil, a Washington, D.C.-based, non-profit group that has lobbiedfor sharp reductions in pollutants that cause acid rain, such assulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.   The council said federal monitoring data revealed the most acidrain was recorded at the Leading Ridge in Huntingdon County, incentral Pennsylvania.   Rain there had an average pH of 4.08, which is 33 times moreacidic than unpolluted rain, the council said recently.   The pH scale measures acidity, with 7 being neutral. The lowerthe number, the more acidic the rain. Unpolluted rain is slightlyacidic, with a pH of 5.6.   Many pollutants are emitted by coal-fired power plants, factoriesand cars. The materials are thought to undergo changes in theatmosphere and fall to Earth as acid rain, snow, sleet, fog and dryparticles.</TEXT></DOC>
