The Canadian Auto Workers union, which represents the plant's 750 workers, said they will vote today on the proposed pact. Terms weren't disclosed.    The union members had been working under the terms of a contract that expired July 10.    At Boeing's de Havilland Aircraft of Canada Ltd. unit in Toronto, about 4,100 Canadian Auto Workers members remain on strike, which began June 23 against the commuter aircraft maker. Talks broke off last month. </TEXT></DOC>
