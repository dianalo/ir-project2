Daily Journal on aid to the Contras:   There is no joy in being able to say ``we told you so''regarding aid to the Nicaraguan Contras when the criminalmisjudgment of Congress may cost us thousands of American lives.   When the vote on military aid for the Contra rebels fighting tooverthrow the illegal Marxist government in Nicaragua came up lastmonth, we argued that Daniel Ortega's recent peaceful overtureswere merely for show, and that if Congress cut off militaryassistance to the rebels, Ortega would quickly resume his warringways and attempt to wipe out the relatively defenseless rebels.   The Sandinistas have now begun to do just that.   Amazingly, many liberals in Congress have refused to recognizethat the man who they thought was their friend, Ortega, has soldthem down the river.   They cannot see that they have been used as pawns by an avowedCommunist who exploited their weaknesses to achieve a militaryadvantage.</TEXT><TEXT>   March 17   Owatonna (Minn.) People's Press on the Iran-Contra indictments:   Since the Iran-Contra scandal broke nearly one and a half yearsago, President Reagan has declined to answer questions about thepossibilities of pardons, should those involved be convicted ofcrimes.   While Reagan's reaction to the indictments (issued last weekagainst former national security adviser John Poindexer, Lt. Col.Oliver North, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord andbusinessman Albert Hakim) and questions about the possibilities ofpardons are of immediate concern, so, too, are the thoughts ofthose seeking election to the office of the presidency.   If Reagan delays a decision on pardons, which he may grant priorto any convictions, the next person elected president of thisnation may well face the decision.   The indictments and the possibility of pardons have heightenedthe importance of the Iran-Contra scandal as a campaign issue.   Now more than ever, the American public needs some answers fromthe candidates, including Vice President George Bush.</TEXT><TEXT>   March 20   Observer-Reporter, Washington, Pa., on money for the poor:   If the United States took all the money spent each year onanti-poverty programs _ about $130 billion _ and divided it by thenumber of Americans categorized by government as poor _ about 32million, each poor person would receive over $4,000; each family offour over $16,000.   Even if we subtracted a reasonable amount for administrativecosts, there would still be more than enough to lift all welfarefamilies above the poverty-income threshold _ $11,202 for a familyof four in 1986.</TEXT><TEXT>   March 18   The Riverside (Calif.) Press-Enterprise on the situation inPanama:   The Reagan administration cuts off aid and payment of canal feesto Panama, and suddenly the rule of strongman Manuel Noriega isbeing challenged, openly and violently, in the streets by his ownpeople.   There is a temptation to say that the White House finally foundthe right button to push to get a rebellion started, but ... thatinterpretation is too simplistic by far. ...   The banks of Panama have been closed for days, they aren'texpected to reopen soon. A canal fee payment, due (last) week fromthe United States, is NOT in the mail. That's a $6.5 millionshortfall right there. ...   It's a lot, but a ruler who had the support of his people couldweather that much and more. But the fact is, the firstdemonstrations against the Noriega regime occurred in Panama City'sstreets last summer. ...   In the year of Costa Rica President Oscar Arias' Nobel PeacePrize for his regional peace plan, there is even less of thatcommodity in Central America than usual. ...   As for the people of Panama, they can concentrate on the oneproblem at hand _ and it looks increasingly as if they aim to dothat, for as long as it takes.</TEXT><TEXT>   March 22   St. Louis Post-Dispatch on the balance of trade:   For America to seek an actual trade surplus is probably unwise.   If the United States were to run a surplus, most of its tradingpartners would have to run deficits, and the majority of thesenations' economies are neither large enough nor rich enough toafford them.   While the U.S. economy continues to grow, even if slowly,Europe's economies remain largely stagnant.   Perhaps Japan could survive a trade deficit for a time, butSouth Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore _ known as the fourAsian ``tigers'' _ could not, for the same reasons as the Europeans.</TEXT></DOC>
