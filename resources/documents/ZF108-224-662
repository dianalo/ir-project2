 Manysuch vendors have tied their software integrally to one particular databasesystem, and must ride along with the fortunes of the company that supportsit.andP;  Usually, 4GL tools enhance an underlying database's functionality, tyingthe two closely togehter.andM;Other vendors have stressed the importance of providing database independenceto customers.andP;  Their philosophy stresses openness rather than enclosure,encouraing use and support of many different RDBMs.andM;Customers are beginning to appreciate this strategy, as many of them findthemselves in a situation where a number of databases are on-line.andP;  Forexample, in the Digital Vax realm, customers have at least two databasesavailable: Vax RMS and Vax Rdb/VMS.andP;  RMS is standard with the Vax VMSoperating system, and Digital has recently made run-time Rdb available forthe cost of the media, by providing a &quot;right to use&quot; licence with each copyof VMS.andM;RMS is generally thought of as a file system rather than a relationaldatabase system.andP;  However, companies such as SmartStar and, more recently,Interbase have developed complete SQL query processors on top of RMS files,so that they in effect become very fast ANSI-SQL prototyping databases.andM;The point is, there are two databases which can be used immediately by manyof Digital's customers.andP;  Some users have other DBMSs as well, such as Oracle,Ingres or Sybase.andP;  Which raises the obvious question: which one do you use?andM;Unfortunately, the selection of a database engine is typically a decisionwhich companies are forced to make before they really know what theirapplications are going to look like.andP;  In reality, each database hasparticular strengths for particular types of applications.andP;  But it is hard toknow ahead of time, before each application has been completed, just whatstrengths will be required.andM;Given this state of affairs, it seems clear that the application should drivethe database decision, rather than the other way around.andP;  Ideally, developersshould be able to postpone the decision of which database to use until it isclear what is required for the application at hand.andM;When application designers work with database-independent tools, they do havethe luxury of postponing such decisions.andP;  They can prototype theirapplications quickly, perhaps using a simple file structure such as RMS.andP;  Thedecision of which database engine will ultimately be used can be made oncethe application itself has taken shape.andP;  Finally, these developers have theoption of changing their minds and migrating their applications to adifferent database system at any time.andM;A corollary benefit to this approach is that a single application can openmore than one DBMS simultaneously.andP;  For example, assume a user is workingwith a personnel database.andP;  There might be an Rdb file which stores theunderlying employee data -- employee name, employee number employee address,and so forth.andP;  And there might be an Oracle database containing salaryinformation.andM;The database-independent methodology enables simultaneous access to those twodifferent DBMSs.andP;  In this case, the different types of personnel informationcan be presented to the user as a unified set of information, even displayedthrough the same form.andM;This approach also provides the ability to migrate data and data definitionsfrom one database type to another -- for example, to convert an Oracledatabase To Rdb.andP;  Even a complete application, which was developed under oneDBMS, can be migrated intact to another DBMS, without code recompilation.andM;A database-independent application development environment should alsoprovide the level of detail necessary to support the unique characteristicsof each particular database type.andM;Over the next several years we expect to continue to see changes and advancesin database and 4GL technologies.andP;  Given the great diversity of availablesystems, customers will select one databse product over another for variouseconomic and technical reasons that no one can foresee at this time.andP;  Astutebuyers will be looking for application development tools which can workinterchangeably with all of these databases, in order to keep pace with theever-changing demands of their businesses.andM;John Markel is president of SmartStar Corp. based in Goleta, CAlif.andP;  Thecompany markets the SmartStar application development environment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
