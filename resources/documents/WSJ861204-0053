Readers may quarrel as to the accuracy of some facts advanced by Sir Rodney, yet many are clearly true, and a matter of public record.                   I   Fortune often has smiled on our great North AmericanEmpire, helping to preserve our Imperial legacy for theenjoyment of future generations. No other story so wellillustrates her intrusion in times of crisis as that which Irecount below, during the late rebellion of His Majesty'swayward subjects. The events were no result of George III'sstatecraft or strategies, wise as these were. Rather, theywere the consequence of the eccentric deeds of Americanrebels, who at the time had strange notions of theinterconnections among statecraft, secret diplomacy andprivate morality. Due to their foolishness, tranquility andobedience soon were restored among His Majesty's NorthAmerican subjects -- conditions which endure to this day.                II   Proclaiming &quot;independence&quot; from Great Britain in 1776, therebellious Continental Congress reached out for aid fromforeign powers hostile to our Empire. Its Foreign AffairsCommittee, under wraps of secrecy, despatched the agent SilasDeane to the Court of Versailles to beg for arms with whichto fight. He was met by a Court intermediary, a certainBeaumarchais. (Author of the subversive comedy, &quot;The Barberof Seville.&quot;) The two of them negotiated a covert arms deal.Vast supplies of weapons surreptitiously were to be drawnfrom French arsenals to equip the Continental army, as it wascalled. This arms deal was handled through a dummycorporation, Roderique Hortalez et Cie. The young,inexperienced King of France, while loathing deception andtrickery, approved the scheme despite warnings from his Navy,War and Budget Ministers. They were aware of the risks ofunwanted war with Britain were the arrangements disclosed.Thus only a trio in the Court managed the plot -- the Kinghimself, and his two other Ministers, Maurepas and Vergennes.Beaumarchais's hired privateers, with false bills of lading,were to embark from ports by night, carrying the preciouscargo across the Atlantic to rebel-held ports.   But such was not to be! Fortune's agent in this sordidscheme was none other than the infamous Tom Paine(1737-1778), a pamphleteer whose tracts inflamed passionsamong some Colonial intellectuals of the time.   Paine was a staffer in the Congressional Foreign RelationsCommittee in Philadelphia. Jealous of Deane, he devouredrumors that the two negotiators were even more secretlyenriching themselves at the expense of their sponsors. Unableto persuade the Committee of this charge, Paine took pen inhand and leaked the whole arms deal story to the Philadelphiapress.   News of Paine's revelations sped across the Atlantic toLondon, providing His Majesty's Ministers with clear evidenceof French perfidy. His Majesty's Ambassador in France,Stormont, angrily confronted Foreign Minister Vergennes withthe evidence. George III penned the warning -- thisunfriendly act, if true, was grounds for war. The usuallysuave Vergennes, visibly shaken, replied in vague, ramblingand mumbling phrases. But two days later, thanks to swiftcouriers, our King received the following penned letter fromVersailles:   Mon cher Cousin:   With dismay I and my Minister the Comte de Vergennes,learn of a seditious plot hatched in our Realm to intervenein the troubles of your North American provinces. YourMajesty, nothing grieves me more than to learn of suchconspiracies! I have found the principals in this plot. Theirassets and arms caches have been seized. A certainBeaumarchais was caught yesterday and on my orders was hangednear the Trianon. Deane, one of your treasonous subjects,will be delivered into the hands of your Majesty's agents atDover tomorrow.   This outburst of republicanism has been checked; the armshave been confiscated at our docks. My Royal brother, beassured that I, in league with you, will vigilantly watch forsigns of such sedition in the future.   Yours Faithfully,   Louis Rex                III   As for Tom Paine (now fired as staffer from the ForeignRelations Committee), friends rallied to him as aCongressional whistle-blower. At a great banquet inPhiladelphia, before the city was captured by His Majesty'sHessians, he was awarded the Peter Zenger Prize, in memory ofthe first American advocate of a free press. Paine, revivedby such support, now enlarged his vendetta against hispersecutors, convincing many Congressmen of the charges ofcorruption he leveled against Deane. Investigations quicklyspread into wide circles of the &quot;government,&quot; seeking othersto be implicated in the secret deals of Deane andBeaumarchais.   For a time, General Washington remained immune from thesearching lanterns of investigative Congressional staffers.But the arms deal in any event was off; Washington's armies,lacking supplies, began to disintegrate.                IV   European capitals watched in wonder as this strange dramaunfolded in Philadelphia. In vain, the French Ambassador tothe Congress rushed in to howl about the honor of France. TheCongressional investigators moved close to Washington'sheadquarters in search of other schemers. Washington, finallysubpoenaed, arrived in Philadelphia in a cold rage.&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he said to the Special Committee, &quot;you havechosen to expose the vital affairs of our Republic in agoldfish -- excuse me -- a piranha fish bowl, where ourenemies can watch. I will no longer cooperate with you. Myarmies have no arms, thanks to you. I resign my commissionand now return to my plantation. There I hope to enjoypeace.&quot; With this Farewell Address, the noble Washingtonstrode out of the Congressional hearings, and off the stageof history. The rebellion ended.                  V   As George III wryly remarked to his Ministers on receivingthis news:   &quot;Now that these idealistic scarecrows no longer will playat sandbox diplomacy, the world can rest more easily.&quot;   ---   Mr. Seabury is a professor at the University ofCalifornia, Berkeley.
