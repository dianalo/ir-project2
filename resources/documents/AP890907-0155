On a voice vote, a subcommittee sent to the full Post Office andCivil Service Committee the legislation, which authorizes a federalagency to repay up to $6,000 of an employee's federal student loandebt in any calender year. The measure also would give agencies theflexibility to pay or reimburse employees for degree training incertain occupations.   The Subcommittee on Civil Service also passed on a voice vote abill to prevent the Department of Housing and Urban Development andother agencies from stacking performance review boards withpolitical appointees. It merely clarifies sections of the CivilService Reform Act by requiring agencies to have a majority ofcareer appointees on review boards when making performance awardrecommendations.   The subcommittee chairman, Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., saidHUD's present policy ``not only circumvents the spirit of the CivilService Reform Act, but also undermines the very goal of aperformance award system.   ``Instead of instituting a system which motivates and awardsindividuals for successful performance, HUD's policy threatens topoliticize and void the award process,'' he said.   The full committee chairman, Rep. William D. Ford, D-Mich.,introduced the student loan bill.   Subcommittee members passed the measure with little fanfare ordiscussion because Sikorski offered an amendment that addressed mostof the problems raised by the administration during a July hearing.   Under the amended bill, an agency may repay a total of $40,000 ofan employee's student loan indebtedness. Employees cannot bereimbursed for any loan payments made before the job began and mustagree in writing, before receiving the benefit, to remain at theagency for a specified period, not less than three years.   In selecting workers for the program, an agency is required inthe bill to follow ``merit principles taking into consideration theneed to maintain a balanced workforce representative of the racial,female-to-male ratio and ethnic makeup of our society.''</TEXT></DOC>
