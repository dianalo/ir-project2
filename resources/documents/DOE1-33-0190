Due tothe fact that s-holes in LiH are not autolocalized, and study of Na/sup0/-centre EPR has not disovered the effect of electron autolocalization,non-irradiating exciton decay in LiH is not realized in regular sectionsof the crystal, but near the defects. Decay of near-the-impurity excitonsin LiH-Na (3.9 eV) forms ''closely'' located F/sub A/-centres (2.3 eV)and non-paramagnetic hydrogen pair associations. Single F-centres (2.45eV) are formed in LiH at extrathreshold hydrogen impact shift towardsinterstitials by fast electrons.</TEXT></DOC>
