Dairy Ashford, Houston, TX 77077; 713-496-9400.andO;List Price: $295.andP;  Requires: 512K RAM (640K recommended), hard disk,Microsoft Windows 2.x or 3.0.andP;  in Short: A powerful but costly Windowscommunications package, Dynacomm includes many valuable features like accessto network modems and 3270 terminal emulation, but they take time to master.andO;The versatile script language can create a variety of applications, includinggames.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
