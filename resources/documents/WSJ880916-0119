The amendment idea is likely going nowhere fast, since additions to the Constitution must pass through Congress.&quot; Wrong.    Fortunately, the Founding Fathers wrote an ingenious check and balance into the Constitution that allows the states to bypass Congress. In addition to allowing Congress to propose an amendment by two-thirds votes of each house, the founders provided that two-thirds of the state legislatures may petition Congress to convene a convention to propose an amendment. Under either method, 38 states must ratify a proposed amendment before it becomes law.    Explaining this provision in the Constitution, James Madison wrote that Article V &quot;equally enables the general and the state governments to originate the amendment of errors as they may be pointed out by the experience on one side or on the other.&quot;    The states created the federal government and they still hold the ultimate say over its power and scope. If the states' lawmakers believe that changes are needed, the Constitution provides a method for controlling Congress.
