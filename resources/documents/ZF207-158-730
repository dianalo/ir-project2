 As a result, mom and popbusinesses were not afforded the luxury of sophisticated call accounting.andM;Bach's TA-500 might very well change all that.andP;  The TA-500 is a full-featuredcall-accounting system which can connect directly to a single line.andP;  Asidefrom purchasing this product, all you'll need is a printer to receivedetailed call reports.andP;  You can even assign account numbers to incoming andoutgoing calls using the pushbuttons on your phone.andM;The TA-500 consists of a small box (8&quot; x 9&quot; x 2 1/2&quot;) and your standard ACadaptor.andP;  The box's control panel is mostly taken up by a rectangular LCDscreen, alongside a rectangle of pushbuttons with their functions clearlymarked.andM;Installation of the TA-500 is no great hassle.andP;  Simply a matter of installinga splitter to a single-line jack, then attaching one lead to the TA-500, theother to the phone.andP;  The TA-500 accommodates up to five lines in this fashionand an unlimited amount of extensions, although, for my purposes, one of eachwas enough.andM;Once the unit was properly wired, I set about programming things like thetime, date and set points.andP;  I also disabled the four extensions I wasn'tprepared to use.andP;  All of these operations were extremely simple and tooprosaic to recount here.andM;After installation, I made plenty of business calls on the line, and receivedalmost as many.andP;  To some outgoing calls, I even attached some hypotheticalcost-account codes to amuse myself.andP;  The TA-500 allows you to enter theaccount codes, up to four digits, right after you've made a call.andP;  I chose&quot;666&quot; for my client &quot;Sexton-Luhmann Apocalyptic Salvation Strategies,&quot; and&quot;1040&quot; for &quot;H andamp; R Pascucci-Bodin-Block, Tax Cheats.&quot;andM;When enough call traffic had passed under the bridge, I decided to beginphase two of the testdrive, first by examining the TA-500's monitoringfeature.andM;When you hit the monitor button, the TA-500 furnishes you with the currentstatus of each line.andP;  Stations one through five are listed at the top of thescreen as &quot;L1,&quot; &quot;L2,&quot; et al.andP;  Underneath each station, you'll see &quot;OUT&quot; (foroutgoing calls), &quot;IN&quot; (for incoming calls), or a blank (meaning the line isnot in use).andP;  Disabled lines draw a blank as well.andP;  Press any of the buttonsone through five, and the screen will serve you up more detailed informationon any line's call status.andM;Well, having properly monitored my phone system, I now want to take a look atall these calls I've been giving and taking.andP;  So I hit the &quot;view&quot; key.andP;  Whatpops up is a detailed record of the first call I made on the system.andP;  On thetop line, the LCD gives me, from left to right: (1) the station I used; (2)the number dialed; and (3) any account code I might have attached to thecall.andM;The bottom line gives you: (1) the date of the call; (2) the time of day; (3)the duration, in minutes; and (4) the cost, in dollars and cents.andM;From here, there's a number of places to go.andP;  First, you can modify theaccount number by pressing the appropriate button and punching in the newdigits.andP;  You can scroll up or down to view previous and subsequent calls.andP;  Oryou can hit the &quot;totals&quot; key to find out the monthly, weekly and daily totalsfor the date of the call in question.andM;Now, perhaps you'd like to try generating a call report.andP;  Simply use thescroll to locate a call falling in the month, week or day you want the callreport to cover.andP;  Hit the print button.andP;  The TA-500 gives you a choicebetween summarized or itemized reports.andM;The system arranges reports by any of four categories -- number (for bothincoming and outgoing calls, line, account or sort.andP;  The first threecategories are, of course, self explanatory.andP;  Either the number, line oraccount will appear in the far-left column of a report, followed bycall-activity information associated with that number, line or account.andM;If you choose the itemized format for, let's say, a line, then you'll get achronological record of all calls made under each employed line, includingdate, time, state, area code and number, account, duration and cost.andP;  Asummarized report according to line will furnish you with the total number ofcalls, number of incoming calls, number of outgoing calls, the total numberof minutes the line was occupied, minutes taken up by incoming calls, byoutgoing calls and total cost.andM;If it's reports by sort you're after, you must enter the sort parameters intothe system.andP;  Our sort report was for all calls made from line one, with areacode 201, with account number 666, with call length longer than two minutesand shorter than five minutes, and with the cost greater than two dollars.andO;Miraculously, Sexton-Luhmann Apocalyptic Salvation Strategies owes me exactly$6.66 for the period in question.andP;  Coincidence?andP;  I think not.andM;Anyway, you get the idea of just how far you can tailor the reports to suityour billing or research needs.andP;  They are organized, easy-to-read and lookquite professional.andP;  No blush of shame need appear on your cheek if youpresent any of them to the client without alteration.andM;In short, Bach's TA-500 puts in a bravura performance.andP;  In addition to theall the exploits recounted here, the Bach will send you an EPROM moduleprogrammed to your specific location.andP;  All they need in order to customizethe EPROM thing is the area code, phone number and the particular carrieryou're using.andP;  Rate changes are a mere $30 for each update chip.andM;&quot;But wait&quot; -- as the late-night commercials say -- &quot;there's more.&quot;andP;  TheTA-500 comes equipped with battery back-up, a one-year warranty, FCC approvaland, yes, even a Bach quarterly newsletter to keep you posted on systemadvances and interesting applications.andP;  Of which we approve heartily, fromour journalistic standpoint.andM;The Bach TA-500 lists for $999, eminently affordable, when you figure howmuch money you can save by accurate reports of your system's activity.andP;  Formore information, call the Bach people at 203-265-6554.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
