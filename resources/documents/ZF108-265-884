 The revolution started in Japan, quickly followed byHongkong and other countries in the Far East.andM;This was a field of modern technology that Europe and the United States were- and still are - relatively slow to embrace.andP;  It was welcomed with open armsby people who had hitherto faced horrendous translation problems if theywished to communicate electronically by any means other than the telephone.andM;Telex messages had to be subjected to a laborious and time-consuming encodingand decoding process which precluded the medium for all but the mostdetermined and dedicated users.andM;Computer-to-computer transmission of text either used the same codingprocedures, or resorted to translation into English at the sending end,followed by conversion to the original language at the destination, with allthe problems of loss of meaning and misunderstanding that inevitablyentailed.andM;Needless to say, most non-Roman users either dealt exclusively in English, orresorted to the much slower airmail, which even today can involve delays ofweeks in some circumstances.andP;  In any case it was absurd for, say, a Chinesecompany in Hongkong to converse in English with another Chinese company inBeijing or Singapore.andM;Like most Western countries, Britain was slow to wake up to the advantages offax and it was not until the postal strike of autumn 1988 that peoplesuddenly discovered there was a paper alternative to the mail.andP;  Moreover, thespeed of fax meant that for short documents the transmission costs were oftenless than the postal charges for the same material.andM;But by far the most important advantage to everybody was the complete lack ofdelay: feed a document into your fax machine, and you know an identical copyis simultaneously emerging from a similar device on the other side of theworld.andM;So fax solved all the problems at one go.andP;  At least, that is what peopleassumed - and still do.andM;People's attitude to fax closely parallels their attitude to computers.andP;  Theyare mesmerised by the wonderful things the technology can do for them butmind-boggled by its complexity.andP;  It all seems so complicated, they leave thedetails to the experts.andP;  The average businessman expects to be able to pressa few buttons according to a preset formula and then let the system takeover.andP;  Worse, he more often avoids any personal involvement, leavingeverything to his secretary or clerical staff.andM;They may be perfectly honest and diligent, but they are likely to have littlemore knowledge than their employer himself.andP;  They in turn rely on what thesupplier, his salesman and his installation mechanic have told them.andP;  Themanuals in their pristine sealed polythene containers are filed away andforotten.andP;  After all, the nice man from the supplier explained it, and it isall so simple.andM;People are slowly waking up to the need for security where computer systemslarge or small are concerned: not only to ensure essential data is backed up,but that prying eyes are unable to see sensitive information.andM;Where fax is concerned, on the other hand, most users exhibit recklessabandon.andP;  Very few are aware that most modern fax machines will storeincoming messages in memory instead of on paper, with the provision of apassword facility so that only an authorised person may read the receiveddocuments.andP;  They may be vaguely aware of a memory storage utility, but mostappear to think of this only in terms of being able to store a document forlater transmission after everybody has left the office for the night.andM;Disregard of the security implications of fax means that sensitiveinformation may come into a central fax room and be seen by any passerby, whocould well be in the pay of a business competitor.andM;The solution to this is pretty obvious: ensure that high security material issent only to a fax terminal with restricted access, preferably a personalmachine on the executive's own desk.andP;  Other safeguards are easily institutedwith a little imaginative consideration.andM;But however elaborate security measures may be at the receiving end, they aretotally useless if a similar degree of precaution is not taken by the sender.andM;A few days ago, a leading Hongkong information technology consultant wastalking to Newsbytes on the telephone.andP;  He broke off for a moment at his faxmachine started buzzing.andP;  He groaned and said he was receiving a solicitor'sletter.andP;  Then he started laughing.andM;The message bore his faxline number, carefully typed on the first page by thesender, but it was not meant for him.andP;  It was a letter to another firm ofsolicitors regarding a legal dispute involving a prominent aircraftengineering company.andM;The sender had not taken the trouble to double-check the destination number.andO;The number on the first page had been carefully and correctly keyed on thetransmitting machine, but it was the wrong number.andP;  It was one digitdifferent from the correct one and as a result, the secret document ended upon the desk of a third party, who fortunately happened to be not only anhonest man, but an expert in the business automation field.andP;  He immediatelyphoned the senior partner of the company sending the fax and explained in nouncertain terms the dangers of using fax without taking the most extreme -yet elementary - precautions to ensure messages were sent to the correctdestination.andM;The document concerned could very easily have ended up on the desk of aninterested party, or someone able to make capital out of privilegedknowledge.andM;It is frequently said that nobody knows how widespread computer crime reallyis because the most serious examples always go unreported.andP;  No bank will everwillingly admit that it has been cheated because that would immediatelydestroy all confidence in it.andP;  It would be very interesting indeed to knowhow many cases there have been of companies falling victim to careless use offax.andM;In Hongkong the biggest single user of fax is the legal profession.andP;  This isan area in which confidentiality is of the utmost importance, yet the examplejust quoted gives the very greatest cause for concern to anyone involved inlitigation.andM;As a businessman your fax machine could be your greatest friend.andP;  It couldalso be your greatest enemy.andM;(Norman Wingrove/19900222)</TEXT></DOC>
