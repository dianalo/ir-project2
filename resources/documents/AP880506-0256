But since the UAW first allowed Chrysler to negotiate a separateconcessionary contract in 1979, the U.S. auto industry has changed,and the pattern contract that is shaping its future has changedwith it.   Instead of just the Big Three _ Chrysler, General Motors Corp.and Ford Motor Co. _ and American Motors Corp., eight U.S. andforeign companies build cars in the United States.   Chrysler bought AMC in August and Volkswagen, the only European,will leave the picture later this year when it closes itsPennsylvania assembly plant.   That leaves Honda Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan MotorCorp. and Mazda Motor Corp. _ all strong Japanese competitors asimporters and all promising strong futures as domestic makers.   So far, the UAW represents only Mazda and one of Toyota's twoU.S. plants.   By 1990, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Fuji Heavy Industries, themaker of Subaru, and Isuzu Motor Co. also will be building cars inthis country.   That means although the UAW will be bargaining with the BigThree simultaneously in 1990, it must face competitive marketrealities it may have ignored before 1979.   The pattern contract is helping reshape Big Three labor andmanagement through 1990 so the companies can survive theincreasingly intensive competition on their home soil.   ``The union and the companies are riding down a rough river withrapids and rocks ahead _ in the same raft. They know that if eitherkicks a hole in the bottom, they'll sink together,'' said DavidCole, director of the Office for the Study of AutomotiveTransportation at the University of Michigan in Dearborn.   Chrysler's 66,000-worker contract must be approved today byleaders of its local unions before it can be presented to the rankand file for ratification.   The contract gives workers greater job security. In turn, itgives the automakers a chance to use workers more flexibly byremoving national union leaders' opposition to Japanese-style workagreements negotiated at the plant level.   Furthermore, while basic wage levels are the same at all threecompanies, workers' earnings can vary by an unprecedented amountfrom company to company because of a profit-sharing formula.   The formula generated nearly $4,000 a worker at Ford from 1987profits, $1,500 for Chrysler workers _ paid as a $500 bonus from aprevious contract and a $1,000 contract-signing bonus _ and nothingfor GM workers.   In the past, the purpose of pattern bargaining was to removewages from competition _ essentially saying the Big Three couldcompete among each other on the basis of productivity and quality,but could not compete on the basis of wage costs, said HarleyShaiken, labor and technology expert at the University ofCalifornia at San Diego.   Now, part of workers' annual pay is dependent on theircompanies' performance.   ``We've seen a tremendous increase in union emphasis on qualityissues. They're saying `If quality sells, we're going to supporteverything in this company that improves quality because we knowit's going to affect our compensation,''' Cole said.   Increasing recognition of the interdependence between managementand workers is key to the Big Three pattern. But at Chrysler, theUAW took it a step farther, forbidding payment of cash or stockexecutive bonuses in years when the profit-sharing formulagenerates no payout for workers.   The clause largely is symbolic: it doesn't affect payoutspromised in executives' contracts, limit the size of bonuses,prevent lost bonuses from being recovered in later years orprohibit stock options _ the main source of the whopping $17.9million Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca took home in 1987.   But, Cole said, it is a first step toward making sure executivesand hourly workers ``understand they are all playing the samegame.''</TEXT></DOC>
