This technique was developed in conjunctionwith the development of a 3-kW free-piston engine. This paper presentsthe analytical basis for the slope-intercept diagnostic technique, validationof this technique with MTI's Engineering Model free-piston engine testdata, and use of this technique in identifying the performance shortfallof a free-piston engine.</TEXT></DOC>
