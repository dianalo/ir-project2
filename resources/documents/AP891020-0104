Snow was still falling this morning in Illinois and Indiana. Bymidmorning 8.5 inches had fallen in Indianapolis in a 24-hourperiod. Southern states also were caught off-guard by unseasonablecold; Georgia officials were barraged with phone calls fromhomeless people seeking shelter.   Two deaths were attributed to the storm, which set recordsthroughout the Midwest for earliest measurable snowfall when itarrived Thursday.   A firefighter in Kentucky was electrocuted by a downed powerline and a Ohio man was killed when his car skidded and hit apickup truck on a snow-slickened road near Dayton.   More than 200,000 utility customers had been without servicelate Thursday in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin, but bydaybreak power had been restored to all but 51,000.   Utility spokesmen said the blackouts were far more widespreadthan they would have been if the storm struck later in the seasonbecause most trees still had their foliage. The leaves trapped thewet, heavy snow until branches snapped from the weight, downingpower lines.   Ohio power crews worked through the night to repair downedlines, but 29,000 customers in Cincinnati and Dayton were stillwithout power by midmorning.   Cincinnati set up an overnight shelter for people without heatin their homes. Officials at the Bush Recreation Center said about25 people stayed there Thursday night, and the center was kept opentoday.   The winter preview followed a weekend of unusually balmy weatherwith temperatures in the 70s and low 80s in the Midwest.   ``Don't put your spring coat away,'' said Ohio National WeatherService meteorologist Bob Thompson. ``We had Indian summer lastweek and now this, and we'll have Indian summer next week.''   About 17,500 people were still without power today in southernMichigan, mostly in the Detroit area. Four to 6 inches of snow wasreported early today in Gaylord, in the northern Lower Peninsula.   In Wisconsin, which got 6 inches of snow in the southeasternpart of the state, 5,000 utility customers were without power as ofsunrise, said Lisa Berman, spokeswoman for Wisconsin Electric PowerCo.   Six inches of snow fell in Milwaukee in the 24-hour period thatended at 7 a.m. today. The previous record for the whole month ofOctober in Milwaukee was 4 inches, the National Weather Servicesaid.   Northern Illinois received about 5.3 inches of snow over thepast 24 hours, but because of temperatures that hovered slightlyabove freezing, only about 2.5 inches remained on the ground today,said National Weather Service forecaster Carl Williams.   ``There's precipitation over much of Illinois. ... Everyreporting station is reporting snow. In southern parts, rain ismixed with snow,'' said Williams.   Light snow fell in the mountains of northern Georgia today and afreeze warning was issued for the entire state for tonight.Columbus, Ga., had a record low temperature of 34 early today,breaking the mark of 35 set in 1981.   Emergency overflow shelters were opened in Atlanta and FultonCounty Thursday, bringing calls from people looking for a warmplace to sleep. Most winter volunteer shelters do not open untilNov. 1.   Bill Holland, shelter coordinator for Task Force for theHomeless, said, ``Everywhere I called was at maximum capacity, buteverybody was able to get somewhere out of the night, so I feltpretty good.''   The chill penetrated even South Florida. West Palm Beach managedto set two records within 18 hours _ a high of 92 Thursday and alow of 56 this morning.   Elsewhere in the state today, Tallahassee bottomed out at 34,Pensacola chilled to 35, Apalachicola wasn't far behind at 42,Daytona Beach hit 44 and Orlando dropped to 46 _ all records forthe date.</TEXT></DOC>
