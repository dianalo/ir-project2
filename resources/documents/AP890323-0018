It's in the budget. Kemp isin favor of it. It's now up to Congress to move,'' he said Wednesdayafter his appearance before the House Banking, Finance and UrbanAffairs subcommitte on economic stabilization.   ``In this case we're not looking for an appropriation, we'relooking for a tax change. ... I don't want to make any announcementsof zones ... until there's actually a tax change,'' Kemp said.``Let's not pass a bill that simply authorizes a zone but doesn't doanything to put a dramatic change in that entrepreneurial climate.''   Kemp said reduction or abolishment of capital gains taxes,same-year tax deduction on up to $100,000 worth of investment andcredits on employee income taxes for individuals and businesseslocated in the zones were needed.   Neither the House nor Senate tax committees has held or scheduledhearings to consider the proposed changes.   The Department of Housing and Urban Development received 270applications for the designation before the January 17 deadline.Thirty-seven states and the District of Columbia have enacted localenterprise zone programs.   The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, as amended bythe McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1988, authorizes the HUDsecretary to designate up to 100 federal enterprise zones, one-thirdof which must be located in rural areas.   The zones are expected to encourage economic development andemployment in previously depressed areas through tax incentives andreductions, improvements in public services, reductions ingovernment bureaucracy and involvement of public and privateagencies to provide jobs and job training.   But a December 1988 study by the General Accounting Office, theinvestigative arm of Congress, found the program in Maryland ``didnot stimulate local economic growth as measured by employment orstrongly influence most employers' decisions about businesslocation.''   GAO said the Maryland program was similar to many of the federalprograms that had been proposed since 1980 when then-Republicancongressman Kemp and Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., first initiatedlegislation.   ``I just don't want to go through another eight years of gettingthese GAO studies of some zone some place that shows that nobodystarted a business because there were no incentives,'' said Kemp.   Whether successful or not, the program ``won't cost anything,''Kemp said.   But GAO estimated more than $1 billion in lost tax revenuesduring the first three years of a program that involved 75 zones and$4.75 billion during the first six years of operation. The Bush 1990budget estimates $1.05 billion in lost revenues over a four-yearperiod.</TEXT></DOC>
