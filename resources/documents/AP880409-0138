An official at the NIH said a special committee has been namedto review allegations of scientific misconduct involving a study onduplicating immunity cells in laboratory mice. The project washeaded by Nobel laureate David Baltimore, director of the WhiteheadInstitute in Boston, and Theresa Imanishi-Kari of Tufts University.Four other researchers were co-authors.   Mary Miers, an executive in the NIH office that investigatesallegations of research misconduct, said the special committee wasorganized after two NIH scientists, Walter W. Stewart and NedFeder, ``raised issues'' about research performed by Imanishi-Kari.   Miers said Stewart and Feder reported their allegations in amanuscript that has been provided to the committee. The two men,who in the past have raised questions about the credibility ofother research efforts, declined to discuss the case with areporter.   Baltimore, who won the Nobel Prize in 1976 for research incellular biology, said in an interview on Friday that he welcomedthe NIH investigation and hopes it will silence the charges ofStewart and Feder who he said have ``acted like a judge and jury''in the case.   Testimony on the controversy will be heard by two separatecongressional subcommittees, both of which have called Stewart andFeder as witnesses.   On Monday, the House subcommittee on government operations andhuman resources will hear the NIH scientists, along with otherwitnesses on the general subject of scientific fraud.   On Tuesday, the House subcommittee on oversight andinvestigation will plow some of the same ground. Feder and Stewartwill again testify, along with a researcher, Margot O'Toole, whoassisted Imanishi-Kari in the controversial study.   The study co-authored by Baltimore, Imanishi-Kari and four otherresearchers was published in the prestigious journal ``Cell'' onApril 25, 1986. The paper, titled ``Altered Repertoire ofEndogenous Immunoglobulin Gene Expression in Transgenic MiceContaining a Rearranged Mu Heavy Chain Gene,'' deals with thereplication of immunity cells in a type of genetically alteredlaboratory mice.   Baltimore said he performed the molecular biology work thatcontributed to half of the paper, and that Imanishi-Kari conductedthe research that dealt with the immune system.   The allegations of misconduct, he said, stem from a ``differencein interpretation'' of research conducted in the laboratory ofImanishi-Kari, who then was at Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology.   He said O'Toole, who was a post-doctoral student assisting inthe research, disagreed with an interpretation by Imanishi-Kari ofhow a monoclonal antibody attached itself to types of immune cells.   O'Toole brought charges of misconduct against Imanishi-Kari, buther allegations were investigated and dismissed by officials at MITand at Tufts.   ``The subject was dropped until somebody got Stewart and Federinterested in the case,'' said Baltimore.</TEXT></DOC>
