Responding to three lawsuits, U.S. District Court Judge LouisOberdorfer issued a preliminary injunction against the random,mandatory testing which was to have begun as early as next week.   He said that the programs may be overly broad and that there islittle evidence in the court record of any drug problem amongemployees covered by the programs.   The judge also temporarily enjoined testing of GSA employeessuspected of using drugs. He said the agency's plan must first berevised to provide that testing is based on more specificrequirements, ``reasonable, articulable and individualizedsuspicion.''   Oberdorfer, however, did allow random drug testing to proceedfor GSA workers who carry firearms.   The judge said he believed a majority of the Supreme Court``would disapprove of the mandatory random testing of the urine ofthe broad range of unarmed employees now slated for testing by theGSA and the EOP.''   Thirty employees in the executive office of the president suedPresident Bush to stop a drug testing plan which covers the Officeof Management and Budget, the U.S. Trade Representative and theOffice of Administration. Drug testing for the executive office ofthe president is designed to cover all employees in positions thatare categorized as sensitive.   Oberdorfer said that none of the 30 who filed the lawsuit has aWhite House pass, that all are subjected to thorough FBI checksbefore their appointment and that all operate under closesupervision.   The court record in the lawsuit filed by the executive office ofthe president employees indicated five drug abuse problems in thepast 40 months involving workers in that office.   The judge said that at the 20,000-employee GSA, there is noevidence that GSA made any systematic study of drug use or itsconsequences.   He noted the agency issued an order last year saying that the``overwhelming majority'' of its workers have never had troublewith illegal drugs.   Some 2,360 GSA employees are covered by the planned drugtesting. One lawsuit there challenged testing in 11 job categoriesrepresenting hundreds of employees, ranging from presidentialappointees to civil engineers.   A GSA official was able to list only 22 cases in five years inwhich the agency took action against employees relating to druguse, Oberdorfer said.</TEXT></DOC>
