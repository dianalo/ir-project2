But economists said they still expect strong growth for at least the next few months.    The Commerce Department said the July decline in its index of leading indicators followed a 1.4% rise in June and a 0.7% drop in May. Separately, the department said the decline in factory orders followed a revised increase of 5.4% in June, previously reported as 5.5%. The factory orders figures aren't adjusted for inflation.    &quot;One month's index is as close to meaningless as possible, but the trend since April does suggest that the economy could slow in early 1989,&quot; said David Wyss of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. He said the index in July stood at about the same level as in April.    Mr. Wyss also said the Federal Reserve Board's recent moves to raise interest rates haven't yet been fully transmitted into the economy. When the effects begin to show, possibly by the end of the year, the economy is likely to slow, he said.    Declines in seven components contributed to the drop in the July index. Only one component, prices of sensitive materials, increased. Another component, the average workweek, was unchanged. Many economists said the July declines generally were reversals of strong increases the previous month. They predicted that many areas will show increases again in August.    The department said a drop in orders for defense equipment helped push new factory orders down in July. Excluding orders for defense capital goods, orders declined 0.7% after a revised 2.9% increase in June. The June increase had been reported earlier as 2.7%.    Orders for durable goods dropped 7.1% in July, offsetting most of the June increase of 8.7%. Durable goods are those intended to last more than three years. Orders for nondurable goods rose 1% after a 1.6% increase in June.    As is often the case, there were large fluctuations in orders for transportation equipment. Orders for both defense and nondefense transportation goods declined 22% in July after a 33% rise the previous month.    Orders for nondefense capital goods, a closely watched barometer of business investment, increased 0.9% in July after a 12.5% rise in June. Evelina Tainer, economist at First National Bank of Chicago, said this indicates the capital spending boom by U.S. businesses will continue.    &quot;On a quarterly basis, orders for nondefense capital goods are running about 30% higher than the average second-quarter annual rate,&quot; she said.    Factory shipments declined 0.9% in July, largely as a result of the decline in orders for transportation goods. Inventories rose 0.5%, with most of the increase coming in durable goods. Manufacturers' backlogs of unfilled orders grew 0.7% in July, with two-thirds of the increase coming in the aircraft industry.    Figures in both the index of leading economic indicators and the factory orders report are seasonally adjusted.    Here are the net contributions of the components of the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators. After various adjustments, they produced a 1.4% rise in the index for June and a 0.8% decline for July.
