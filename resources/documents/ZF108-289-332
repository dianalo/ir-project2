 At the same time, Scitex made significant anouncements about thefinancial position of the company and about a major acquisition: IrisGraphics (see box, below).andP;  The journalists also saw some of Scitex'sproduction facilities.andM;Following the press conference, the journalists had to endure the hard partof being a member of this profession, as Scitex treated the party toexcellent winning and dining and two days of being shown around Israel.andP;  Itsentertainment and hospitality was as good as the results produced by itssystems.andP;  (It's hard life being an international jet-setting journalist,isn't it?)andM;Company status.andP;  Scitex claims to have 40% of the color electronic prepresssystems market, with more than 1,200 systems installed at more than 900customers.andP;  Currently, 40-50% of its revenues are coming from repeat oradd-on business from its existing customers.andP;  The product mix is changingrapidly, however; 80% of revenues are coming from the Whisper product line,whereas 18 months ago the majority of them were coming from the older Fyroxproducts.andM;The Handshake standard is by far the market leader in interfacing to high-endcolor systems.andP;  More than 130 vendors now support this standard.andM;Objectives.andP;  At the conference, Scitex president and CEO Arie Rosenfeldoutlined the company's aims both for and beyond Drupa.andP;  It intends tomaintain dominance in the professional color prepress market and to play asignificant role in all new market segments where color isgrowing--commercial printers, publishers, design, corporate publishing, imagedata communications and digital proofing.andM;Rosenfeld also listed three more objectives: to continue to enhance theperformance of Scitex systems as operated by current customers, to furtherstress open system architectures and to offer customers full and optimalsystem integration.andP;  To achieve these objectives, Scitex will have at Drupa afull range of products for high-end professional color prepress; forcommercial printers who wish to add color repro capabilities; for publishersof magazines, newspapers, catalogs, etc.; for corporate publishingdepartments; for desktop publishing and the world of PostScript; for designstudios and advertising agencies; and for color image communication acrossall applications.andM;The new product line.andP;  Scitex showed the press a range of new products thatwill be launched at Drupa.andP;  All are currently in beta test, but will beshipped within 90 days of the show.andM;The new products are:andM;* The First System, an entry-level color page makeup system.andM;* SmarTwo, a tabletop CCD scanner using the proven Smart scanner technology.andM;* MicroAssembler, a lower-priced, smaller-footprint Assembler page assemblyworkstation.andM;* Dolev PS, a compact, high-quality color imagesetter that outputs PostScriptdata.andM;* PSBridge, an Adobe PostScript language interface product running on an IBMPS/2 Model 80 computer that interprets PostScript files for input into Scitexsystems.andM;* Raysat, a remote imagesetting system using the Raystar plotter.andM;The First System.andP;  Scitex's new entry-level system is the First System, atotal color scanning and page assembly system priced below $375,000.andP;  TheFirst console, built using the MicroWhisper computer, contains the functionsof the Smart scanner console plus the page assembly functions of theMicroAssembler.andP;  This full-function page stripping station has asophisticated scanning operation using the new SmarTwo desktop CCD printer(see below).andM;Page assembly has all the functions of the MicroAssembler, including globalcolor editing, page geometry, interactive tints, continuous-tone imagepositioning, automatic chokes and spreads, and close crop masking andvignettes.andP;  Scitex is adding to the Assembler, MicroAssembler and SmartViewthe ability to pixel clone for cleaning up scratches or removing elementsfrom images.andM;Output from the First System is to the Dolev imagesetter.andP;  The new Dolev, amodified version of the current desktop model, is a floor-standing systemwith an increased resolution of up to 3,556 dpi (140 dots/mm) and the abilityto output screens of up to 250 lines per inch.andP;  The unit has a 500 X 358 mm(19.68 X 14-inch) output size, and at 2,540 dpi has a speed of 3 minutes perA3 page (which can be two A4 separations).andP;  It has a large 200-foot(60-meter) input cassette.andM;The introduction of the First System may necessitate some name changing.andO;Which is the entry-level system: the First System or the (more expensive)current Starter system?andM;MicroAssembler.andP;  Scitex introduced at IFRA its new MicroWhisper computer,which has a far smaller footprint than the normal Whisper because it has farfewer slots for special-purpose boards.andP;  At IFRA, this computer was used foradd-on products such as the Xcellerator unit to speed up the older Fyroxproducts.andP;  At Drupa, the MicroWhisper will be used in the MicroAssemblerworkstation, which is an element of the First System.andM;SmarTwo.andP;  The new SmarTwo desktop CCD scanner is built using the sameprinciples as the existing Smart Scanner, of which there are now 200 unitsoperational in the field.andP;  It differs in that it has a smaller input formatof only 35 mm and 6 X 7 cm and it can only accept transparencies, whereas theSmart Scanner can accept both transparencies and reflective copy of up to 10X 8 inches.andM;The SmarTwo has exactly the same operating procedures as, and most of thecapabilities of, the Smart Scanner.andP;  The same screen is used for pageassembly, and once the scanning has been set up using the screen-resolutionquick scan, scanning at high resolution is carried out in the backgroundwhile page assembly takes place.andP;  However, it uses a MicroWhisper-basedcomputer with a 12-bit color console called SmartView, unlike the 24-bitdisplay of the Smart Scanner's SoftProof.andP;  The SmarTwo can handle group scansof more than one image within the transparency carrier: each image is plannedat the prescan stage, then the images are scanned separately as a backgroundtask.andP;  There can be different scaling and rotation factors for each image.andM;We were told in private discussions afterward that Scitex plans to sell theSmarTwo as an OEM product.andP;  It will be interfaced into an Apple Macintosh IIand will offer the same level of operational functionality as the currentsoftware running on the MicroWhisper platform.andP;  A prescan will be shown onthe Macintosh screen, and then the various setup operations will be carriedout, before the high-resolution scan takes place.andP;  Scitex was not surewhether it would complete this product in time to show it at Drupa.andM;PostScript directions.andP;  Scitex was the first major color vendor to providelinks into other systems through its Handshake software.andP;  Later, it was thefirst company to link into desktop publishing with its Visionary product, andlater with its VIP (Visionary Interpreter for PostScript), which convertedstandard PostScript files into Scitex line art format.andM;At Drupa, Scitex will move further into providing a full PostScript solutionfor the color market through two products: PS Bridge and Dolev PS.andP;  These areessentially the same product with a different marketing approach.andM;PS Bridge.andP;  Initially preannounced at the Seybold European PublishingConference last December, PS Bridge takes PostScript files into a Scitexsystem.andP;  It runs on an IBM PS/2 Model 80/311 computer under the AIX operatingsystem, with 8 MB of RAM.andM;PS Bridge works in a similar fashion to the VIP system on the VisionaryGateway on the Macintosh: PostScript input is read in and converted to Scitexcontone and line work formats for transfer into a Scitex system.andP;  However, PSBridge goes further than other systems by using Display PostScript technologyin two ways.andP;  It is used to provide a full-page preview on the PS/2's VGAcolor monitor.andP;  And because PS Bridge uses the kernel of Display PostScript,which is optimized for speed and adapted by Adobe to operate at resolutionsof up to 5,000 dpi, it provides a faster conversion of PostScript than byusing the standard Adobe PostScript software.andM;As one would expect from Adobe, the software uses both Type 1 and Type 3fonts.andM;The Adobe Display, PostScript software generates a display list, which isthen passed to Scitex's own software in PS Bridge.andP;  This software producesthe specific Scitex device implementation in Scitex native format.andM;Input to PS Bridge is from 3.5-or 5.25-inch diskettes or via LocalTalk.andP;  TheEthertalk interface is under development.andP;  When linked to a Macintosh, the PSBridge is selected from the Chooser and is set up as a separate device foreach required output resolution.andP;  The file is sent to the PS/2, where it isqueued, thus making possible a largely unattended operation.andP;  Output is viathe GPIB or Ethernet connection to a Scitex workstation, where it operates asa background task.andM;DOlev PS.andP;  The PS Bridge software is also used as the PostScript front end(rather than RIP) for the Dolev PS, a full Adobe PostScript colorimagesetter.andP;  This is a standard Dolev unit with a direct connection to a PSBridge via a fiber-optic cable.andM;The benefit of this approach is that the system uses the normal Dolev RIP forscreen generation using the Scitex electronic screening (Scitex has licensedthe Hell color screening patents).andP;  This means it offers the full Scitexfrequency and angle combinations and a choice of dot shapes.andP;  On output, italso provides registration marks and a standard control strip for checking.andM;The operational structure for the Dolev PS is that PostScript data is readinto the PS/2 computer, where it is interpreted using the standard PS Bridgesoftware.andP;  This software generates initially a display list file, which isthen converted into a Scitex contone and line art file.andP;  This file is thendirectly transferred to the Dolev RIP, which handles on-the-fly screening andexposing of film into the four color separations.andM;Dolev PS is aimed at a new generation of Scitex customers, who are looking touse PostScript systems and who need a higher quality of color output thanScitex claims is currently available in terms of both quality and speed.andP;  Asan example, the company showed the Dolev PS's speed for running the Seyboldspeed test using the Trout image (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  1).andP;  This was imaged ata resolution of 2,540 dpi and took a total time of 15 minutes and 44 seconds.andO;Scitex quoted the time for a competitive device at the same resolution: 38minutes and 15 seconds.andM;In our recent update to the speed tests, however, the Scitex time for theDolev PS was beaten by the Compugraphic 9800 using the new Max Plus RIP, onwhich the total time at 2,400 dpi was 10 minutes.andP;  The Linotronic 300 withRIP4 running at 2,540 dpi took 26 minutes and 5 seconds.andP;  As anothercomparison, the Scitex VIP running on a Macintosh II took a total of 44minutes and 6 seconds to take input and output it to the Dolev plotter.andM;The Dolev PS is obviously reasonably fast for a PostScript unit and comparesvery favorably with other current units.andP;  It also offers one benefit that theother units do not offer: the proven quality of the Scitex screening system,which uses the licensed Hell screening patents.andP;  No other PostScript systemsold as a separate PostScript typesetter currently offers this.andM;In terms of both speed and quality, it appears that the more color imagesthere are relative to the amount of text, the better the Dolev PS willcompare against other PostScript imaging units.andP;  In addition, the built-insoft-proofing function using Display PostScript on the PS/2 can be a usefulbenefit.andM;Scitex is now covering many of the opportunities for PostScript color files.andO;They can be handled via PS Bridge into any Scitex system, via VIP on theVisionary Gateway--again into a Scitex system, and via Visionary to handlepage layout into a Scitex system.andM;These solutions are all for users who wish to take PostScript into a high-endcolor system for further work.andP;  However, Scitex is now offering its qualityand speed levels to customers who don't use Scitex systems, but who wish tooutput PostScript color to a high-quality, fast PostScript imagesetter,through the new Dolev PS.andM;For companies that will use some other system to geneate the outputPostScript pages, the planned Macintosh version of the SmarTwo scanner shouldprovide a full high-quality image scanning system.andP;  Through this route,Scitex will support the growing mid-level system market as well as the highend.andM;Raysat.andP;  Raysat allows imagesetters at a remote site to operate as completeelements of the system as an alternative to using high-resolution facsimilesystems.andP;  The new U.S.andP;  sports newspaper, The National (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andO;11), is using Raysat units for remote output of color pages at five sites.andM;The Raysat system comprises at the transmitting site a MicroWhisper computertrack, the communications manager program running on an AT-compatiblecomputer, the transmitter software, Scitex's MacroStorage disk array, themodem and control software.andP;  At the receiving site there is a modifiedRaystar imager, the receiving system using a MicroWhisper computer, theMaccoStorage disk array, the modem and the software.andP;  Up to 32 remoteimagesetters can be included in one Raysat system.andM;In the system's normal operation, files to be transmitted are sent from theworkstation to a file server.andP;  They are pulled from the server according to apredetermined sequence for transmission to the imagesetter at the remotesite, where transmission is over any standard line using an RS-422 interface.andO;At The National, the communication lines are GTE T-1 lines.andM;The structure used and Raysat is also used in a number of other remoteapplications, including remote proofing.andP;  Busche in Hamburg, West Germany, isusing a similar structure employing a MicroWhisper at the client site inDortmund to send proofs, both for viewing on a SoftView terminal and foroutput on an Iris proofer.andM;Summary.andP;  Naturally, when one has been royally entertained in a differentcountry, as on our recent visit to Israel, one likes to be complimentaryabout the event.andP;  This guideline applies equally to Seybold, even though weare not taking advertising from Scitex.andP;  However, it would be difficult tofind much to fault with what we saw.andM;Scitex has weathered the problems it largely generated for itself when itintroduced its Whisper product line in 1986 at Drupa, long before the productwas ready for shipment.andP;  Now highly profitable, Scitex is almost certainlythe most successful color vendor at present.andM;Throughout the 1980s, Scitex has been the most innovative and progressivecompany in the color industry, being the first to introduce almost all newaspects of color systems.andP;  One can point to the move to full-functionworkstations, then to distributed workstations.andP;  It was the first to linkwith the outside world through its Handshake interface, and then to provide adesktop-based page planning approach for installaion at its customer sitesthrough Visionary.andM;Entering the 1990s, Scitex is showing that it is still innovating despite thedeparture of its earlier leader, Efi Arazi, who was the inspirational head ofthe company.andP;  It has learned its lessons from launching products too early;we are told all the new products will be shipped within 90 days of Drupa.andM;For Drupa, Scitex has not gone as far as some people were thinking: there isno completely new system on a standard platform.andP;  However, the company hasbrought its technology using the Whisper further down market, and its FirstSystem is priced at a very attractive level for new companies entering thecolor market that want to go with an established supplier.andP;  Rather than shutits eyes to the evolving market for desktop color systems, it will provideboth input and output for such systems and will offer bridges from them intoa full Scitex system.andP;  It readily admits that it does not have thedistribution channels in place at present to satisfy these new markets, whereit will be a peripheral supplier; it is still evaluating how it shouldapproach such markets.andM;But Scitex is not doing this at the expense of its traditional market.andP;  It ismaking the entry price for this market lower, just when the traditionaltypesetter vendors (Compugraphics, Linotype, Scangraphci and others) arecasting their eyes at the area of color and introducing new systems.andP;  It isalso adding functions to enhance the high-end capabilities of Scitex systems,for example with its telecommunications functions for remote plotting andproofing.andP;  Another item we are told we will see from Scitex at Drupa isreal-time image data compression, using similar technology to that beingoffered by Efi Arazi's company, Electronics for Imaging.andM;We have seen most of the items to be shown at Drupa, but there will be a fewothers.andP;  One of these, we were told, is further development work linked withthe Iris ink-jet proofing systems, using MicroWhisper technology to devise avery controllable proofing system that Scitex claims will provide acontract-quality proof (with the one exception of not showing the halftonedot structure) at a price that will be a fraction of the new digital colorproofing systems to be introduced by other companies at Drupa.andM;For anyone with an interest in color, the Scitex stand at Drupa will berequired viewing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
