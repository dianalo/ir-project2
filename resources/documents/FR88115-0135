Proven natural gas reserves in the PrudhoeBay area of Alaska's North Slope represent approximately 15 percent oftotal U.S. gas reserves. In addition, undiscovered, recoverable suppliesof natural gas from Alaska's North Slope may exceed 100 trillion cubicfeet. There can be no doubt the development of Alaskan oil has played animportant role in ensuring adequate energy supplies at reasonable pricesfor American consumers. I believe efficient development of Alaska naturalgas will provide similar benefits. Leaving this resource undeveloped benefitsno one. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Efficient development of Alaska natural gas on the basis of marketfinancing could encompass the export of some of this gas to other countries.Because world energy markets are interrelated, our Nation will benefitfrom an enlarged international gas supply. Production of Alaska reserveswill increase the amount of secure energy sources available at market pricesand, thus, displace less secure or more expensive energy sources, includingoil from the Persian Gulf. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Before Alaska natural gas can be exported to nations other than Canadaor Mexico, Section 12 of the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act (15U.S.C. 719j) requires me to find exportation ``will not diminish the totalquantity or quality nor increase the total price of energy available tothe United States.'' In order to make this finding, it has been necessaryto assess the relationship of Alaska natural gas to the U.S. energy market.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">There exist adequate, secure, reasonably priced supplies of naturalgas to meet the demand of American consumers for the foreseeable future.This demand can be met by lower-48 production and already-approved Canadianimports. If necessary, this demand also can be met at lower delivered energycost by coal, oil, imported liquified natural gas (LNG), natural gas fromMexico, and other energy sources. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Given these facts, exports of Alaska natural gas would represent ajudgment by the market that the energy demands of American consumers canbe met adequately from other sources at comparable or lower prices. Exportsof Alaska natural gas would not diminish the total quantity or qualityof energy available to U.S. consumers because world energy resources wouldbe increased and other more efficient supplies would thus be available.Finally, exports would not increase the price of energy available to consumerssince increased availability of secure energy sources tends to stabilizeor lower energy prices. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Accordingly, I find that exports of Alaska natural gas in quantitiesin excess of 1,000 Mcf per day will not diminish the total quantity orquality nor increase the total price of energy available to the UnitedStates. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This finding removes the Section 12 regulatory impediment to Alaskannatural gas exports in a manner that allows any private party to developthis resource and sets up competition for this purpose. It is my beliefthat removal of this impediment to private sector development of Alaska'svast natural gas resources, using private sector resources with no governmentsubsidy, will benefit our entire Nation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This finding represents a determination that the effects of exportsof Alaska natural gas on American consumers would comply with the marketcriteria of Section 12 in the context of current and projected future energymarkets and that such exports would be consistent with our comprehensiveenergy policy. It does not assess the merits or feasibility of a particularproject, but rather lets the marketplace undertake a realistic considerationof various options concerning Alaska natural gas. The operation of marketforces is the best guarantee that Alaska natural gas will be developedefficiently and that there is an incentive to find additional reserves.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">I do not believe this finding should hinder completion of the AlaskaNatural Gas Transportation System (ANGTS). This Administration supportsthe timely, economic development of Alaskan natural resources. To thisend the Administration has removed all regulatory barriers to the privatesector's expeditious completion of this project. In particular, I wantto reaffirm our support for the special regulatory treatment of the ``prebuild''portion of ANGTS, including the minimum revenue stream guarantees. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This finding shall be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. <ITAG tagnum="65">andPres; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="13">THE WHITE HOUSE, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Washington, January 12, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">[FR Doc. 88-888 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Filed 1-13-88; 2:39 pm] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="50">Billing code 3195-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
