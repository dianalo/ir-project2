Protesters in acrowd estimated by police to be 125 to 150 waved flags and signsand shouted anti-nuclear slogans.   Organizers of the rally said they planned no civil disobedienceSunday. Last Saturday, some 475 arrests were made as hundreds ofactivists climbed the fence at the plant in Seabrook, N.H., so theycould be picked up for trespassing.   Kennebunkport police Chief John Prescott said that theprotesters had caused no problems. Ehrenberg said that Prescott andother local officials were cooperative as the demonstratorsarranged their rally.   The plant, completed in 1986 and owned by a dozen utilities,lacks a commercial operating license because of challenges toevacuation plans for surrounding communities in Massachusetts andNew Hampshire.   The fate of an operating license for Seabrook is pending withthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Washington, but the opponentsinclude Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon, who has vowedto fight the license in federal court.   Seabrook spokesman Ron Sher said the plant ``has been the mostclosely studied nuclear plant ever licensed and the experts haveconcluded that Seabrook station is safe.''</TEXT></DOC>
