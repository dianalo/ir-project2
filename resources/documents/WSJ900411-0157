But beyond issuing renewed pleas to overproducers such asKuwait to cut output, it's unlikely the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries will be able to take any actiontoward trimming the oil glut before late May. That's when the13 oil ministers hold their regular midyear conference andwill decide second-half quotas.</LP><TEXT>   OPEC sources contacted yesterday ruled out the possibilityof any special meeting before then, despite the growingurgency of world pricing and production problems.Nevertheless, said a senior official of one OPEC delegation,&quot;we are really watching the situation closely.&quot;   Meantime, petroleum prices approached a free fall.   West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery plungedthrough the psychologically important level of $18 a barrelyesterday afternoon with hardly a pause. It went on to settleat $17.68 a barrel, down 76 cents for the day. The June crudecontract fell 61 cents to $18.34 on the New York MercantileExchange.   Only 10 days ago, futures prices of the U.S. benchmarkcrude were well above $20 a barrel. Yesterday's closing pricewas the lowest for the near-month crude contract sinceFebruary 1989.   Futures prices of gasoline fell even further than thosefor crude. Unleaded gasoline for May delivery was down 2.46cents a gallon to 58.43 cents a gallon. Some other monthlycontracts fell the limit of two cents a gallon. May heatingoil was down 0.67 cent.   The U.S. price declines followed earlier drops in Europeanmarkets. The extent of the pricing rout surprised oilanalysts. &quot;We've got a blood bath,&quot; said Peter Beutel ofElders Futures Inc.   Oil prices have been coming down since this year's peak inJanuary. The latest and fastest fall began early last week.Analysts cited the apparent slowing in petroleum demand andOPEC output of some 24 million barrels a day, or two millionabove the first-half ceiling and the highest since 1981.   There were reports yesterday that many storage facilitieswere filled to overflowing. Also, further adding to thebearish sentiment in oil markets was new evidence ofincreasing oil inventories.   Energy Security Analysis Inc. yesterday reported &quot;anothersignificant build&quot; in crude stocks in Europe for the secondmonth in a row. According to the Washington-based firm, whichmonitors oil supplies world-wide, European crude inventoriesincreased seven million barrels during the month of March.   Then, after trading had closed, the American PetroleumInstitute released its latest weekly report, which showed abig buildup in U.S. crude oil inventories. According to theAPI, crude inventories, which already were substantiallyahead of the year-earlier level, rose 8.1 million barrelslast week to 370.9 million barrels.   It was clear yesterday that such developments arebeginning to have an impact within OPEC. An editorial in apro-government newspaper in Saudi Arabia warned that theoverproduction could lead to another &quot;oil-price crisis.&quot; SomeOPEC sources interpreted this as the official reaction in thekingdom and saw it as a threat that Saudi Arabia might beconsidering another pricing war unless quota-cheaters curbtheir output.   Kuwait is the chief target of the fingerpointing in OPEC.It has openly ignored its quota and has recommended that OPECquit setting production ceilings. However, Ali KhalifaAl-Sabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister, has indicated he wouldcut output if the OPEC price dropped under $18 a barrel for asustained period and if there were no official productionquotas.   One senior OPEC official noted yesterday that the averageof the prices of the seven crudes that make up the OPECreference basket had dropped to $17.12 in the first week ofApril from $18.28 in the first week of March. &quot;That is morethan $1 in four weeks,&quot; he said. &quot;That is precisely whatSheik Ali of Kuwait said would cause him and others to reducetheir production.&quot;   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          COCOA: Futures prices soared to ninemonth highs on rumorsof worsening political unrest in the Ivory Coast, the world'sleading cocoa producer. The May-delivery contract, whicheased at the opening, rebounded by more than $100 a metricton to close at $1,329, for a gain of $76. That price was thehighest since the September 1989 contract traded at $1,342 onAug. 2. Selling that had prevailed in the previous twosessions continued early yesterday, and traders tended toignore reports that bank employees in the Ivory Coast hadgone on strike, analysts said. However, when it was rumoredthat the bank strike could create problems with exports, andthat dockworkers might also walk off their jobs, previousshort sellers began buying contracts to cover theirpositions, and prices rebounded sharply. Sandra Kaul, ananalyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, said two things must bekept in mind with respect to any prospects of interruption ofexports: First, the Ivory Coast is between its main crop andits second, or midcrop, and very little cocoa is moving toports at the moment. Second, Ivory Coast troops are loyal toPresident Felix Houphouet-Boigny. &quot;This means that if portworkers go on strike, the troops could be put to work on thedocks, minimizing any interruption of exports,&quot; Ms. Kaulsaid.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices closed near their highs of the day.The May-delivery contract ended with a gain of 2.65 cents apound at $1.1935, just below the day's high of $1.1950. Whiletechnical considerations may have caused prices to fluctuatefrom day to day, strong fundamental factors that underlie themarket have continued right along, and yesterday became morepronounced, one analyst said. He particularly noted that thestrike of Southern Peru Copper Corp.'s miners and smelterworkers in Peru, which began March 12, continues and couldbecome a major unsettling element in the market. The analystsaid there were reports that the company sent telegrams tocustomers advising them that copper-shipment commitments forApril would be met. The analyst pointed out that the companywas behind in shipments for previous months and that therewas doubt it could make the April shipments. Another analystsaid the company's message to customers &quot;may not haverevealed the full extent of the delays. Southern Peru mayship the copper that is scheduled to be exported in April,but it may do so in May or even later.&quot; A company spokesmansaid Southern Peru had advised its customers that it wouldmeet shipments for March and April, but it was &quot;premature todiscuss May.&quot; He said the company would try to meet itscommitments &quot;on a reasonable schedule.&quot; The company producesabout 240,000 tons of refined copper annually. Peru is theworld's sixth-largest copper producer.                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of corn and soybean futurescontracts might get an upward boost at the open of tradingthis morning. After the close of trading yesterday, theAgriculture Department slightly trimmed its monthly estimateof the nation's grain stockpiles. The department cut itsestimate for the U.S. soybean stockpile on Aug. 31 to 305million bushels from its March estimate of 330 millionbushels. The department forecasts the amount of old soybeansthat will be in storage by the time the new harvest begins.The department cut its estimate of the corn carry-over thisfall to 1.33 billion bushels from the 1.48 billion bushels itforecast last month. The decline is on the high end of therange that analysts had expected, according to VictorLespinasse, a floor broker with Dean Witter Reynolds,Chicago. The department pegged the U.S. wheat crop at 442million bushels, down one million bushels from the Marchestimate. However, grain analysts had expected the departmentto raise its month-old estimate by about 15 million bushels,Mr. Lespinasse said. The department also cut its estimate ofthe Brazilian soybean harvest, which is about one-thirdcomplete, to 20 million metric tons from the 20.5 millionmetric tons it forecast last month. Trading was quietyesterday as traders took to the sidelines before the reportwas released. Corn prices rose, soybean prices dipped andwheat prices settled mixed.</TEXT></DOC>
