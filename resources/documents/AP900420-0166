The $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope, NASA's most valuablepayload, is scheduled to head into orbit aboard Discovery onTuesday. Its first launch attempt was scrubbed shortly beforeliftoff April 10 when a shuttle power unit failed.   The two-week delay has pushed the shuttle Columbia's May 9launch date back a week or two. In addition to seven astronauts,four of them astronomers, Columbia will be carrying a $100 millionobservatory called Astro that is intended to complement Hubble'swork.   NASA plans to roll Columbia out to the launch pad Sunday, 1.6miles from where Discovery awaits a Tuesday liftoff. It will beonly the second time that both of Kennedy Space Center's shuttlelaunch pads have been occupied at the same time.   Columbia and Challenger occupied the launch pads in January1986. Ten days after Columbia landed, Challenger exploded.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is waiting forDiscovery to go up before setting a new launch date for Columbia.   ``We tease the Hubble crew that if they don't get out of theway, we're going to go ahead of them,'' said Air Force Col. GuyGardner, Columbia's pilot.   Discovery's payload bay doors were reopened Friday, andtechnicians began the daylong task of installing Hubble'sbatteries. NASA completed 130 hours of recharging the sixnickel-hydrogen batteries in a laboratory on Thursday.   NASA planned to test the batteries Saturday and seal the payloadbay later in the day. The countdown for Discovery was to beginSaturday afternoon, with the five crew members returning to KennedySpace Center on Sunday.   At a news conference, Columbia's astronauts readily agreedFriday that the much-touted Hubble is the ``crown jewel'' of NASA'sastronomical endeavors. But they said Astro's three ultravioletinstruments and broad band X-ray telescope also will shed light ongalaxies, black holes and quasars during the nine days of themission.   While Hubble will be able to discern objects in space withextraordinary clarity and allow astronomers to look back to almostthe beginning of time, Astro will have a wider field of view and bebetter able to detect ultraviolet light. Astronomers expect Astroto uncover targets on which Hubble can focus during the telescope's15 years in orbit.   Columbia mission specialist Jeffrey Hoffman insists ``it's not acompetition'' between Hubble and Astro or between the crews. Still,he can't resist ribbing Discovery's astronauts every now and then.   ``We get to be astronomers,'' he said. ``All they do is throwout a telescope. Anybody can do that.''</TEXT></DOC>
