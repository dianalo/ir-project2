Bush's visit with his wife, Barbara, seemed one part diplomacy,three parts nostalgic homecoming.   It was the president's fifth trip to China _ and his wife's sixth_ since he represented U.S. interests here as a special envoy in1974-75, after President Nixon reopened Sino-American contacts butbefore formal diplomatic relations were restored.

During a brief visit, Bush is expected to discuss ways to reducefriction and to review the friendship. U.S. and South Koreanofficials say relations are excellent, but they want to ensureanti-American sentiment does not threaten their ties.   Anti-Americanism has mushroomed among groups ranging from radicalstudents to conservative farmers, all accusing the United States ofexploiting South Korea. Complaints range from claims of militaryoccupation to unfair trade pressure and cultural insensitivity.   As South Korea has become stronger in recent years, growingnationalism and resentment of some U.S. policies have aggravatedanti-American sentiment, analysts say. The United States also hasbeen singled out as a target by anti-government groups trying togain support by whipping up nationalist sentiment, they say.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The explosive ripping open of United Air Lines'oldest Boeing 747 over the Pacific Ocean came as an air safety taskforce was about to propose mandatory work on all aging Boeingairliners.   Investigators consider structural failure a likely cause _although a mechanical problem, human error or sabotage have not beenruled out _ for the incident Friday in which nine passengers died.   No matter the cause, the geriatric jumbo jet sitting on thetarmac at Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu with a 10-by-40-foothole in its side provided a graphic new illustration of continuingconcern over the safety of commercial aviation.   Two days before the harrowing sky drama, the head of Boeing, F.A. Shrontz, had declared in a speech: ``We believe fundamentallythat with proper maintenance and proper inspection an airplane canin fact last forever.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   John Tower is going public with his campaign tobecome defense secretary as President Bush vows to go face-to-facewith wavering senators in an effort to win enough Democratic supportto get Tower confirmed.

The number of Central Americans bothering to apply for asylum hasplummeted since last week when the U.S. Immigration andNaturalization Service toughened its stance on political asylumapplicants. The INS reported it processed 233 asylum applicationsTuesday, the first day of the get-tough procedure, and only 19 wereprocessed Friday; over that period, three were granted asylum.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Calls came from people as far away as 300miles and their instructions to Louisiana legislators were clear:Seat David Duke in the state House.   It was exactly as the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan hadpredicted during his campaign. His anti-tax, anti-affirmativeaction, anti-welfare message was out of the bag and his backers werespeaking up all over the state.   ``My election, my winning it with my controversial background,has made it OK for other candidates and other public officials toaddress the issues that I've addressed,'' Duke said.

During his one-day trial Tuesday, the short, shy dissident stoodin the courtroom next to the plainclothes police major who arrestedhim on Prague's Wenceslas Square.   In a city where symbols and memories of the past haveextraordinary power, the policeman confronting the writer seemed tostand for the situation in Czechoslovakia; the officer representingthe authorities, and Havel representing an increasingly dissatisfiedpeople.   The authorities showed their strength at the trial, jailing Havelfor nine months and sending a stern message that Czechoslovakia willnot tolerate the kind of changes sweeping through the Soviet bloc.</TEXT><DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With every passing day of blue skies,water experts are growing more and more pessimistic that the statecan avoid an unprecedented third year of drought that would lead tostrict water rationing.   ``After the dry January, a lot of my optimism faded,'' said BobVasconcellos, resources and planning manager for the San FranciscoWater Department.   ``I'm preparing for another year of this. January is normally thewettest month in most areas. If you don't get the rain in January,your chances (of recovery) are pretty slim.''
