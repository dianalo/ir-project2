Sam Nunn makes his way to a microphone in front of a row of American flags.    At one time, many thought he would be taking center stage here as part of the Democratic presidential ticket. That didn't happen, but he's still busy politicking, promoting an idea: national service -- a system in which young people and senior citizens take military and nonmilitary public-service jobs in exchange for public grants.    The Georgia senator is one of five politicians who sing the praises of national service during a two-hour hearing here at the Democratic National Convention. The room is filled to overflowing with enthusiasts of the Nunn proposal, and the event at times takes on the air of a rally. Delegates from Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and New York stand to add their voices to the chorus.    But the salesmanship is just beginning. Hundreds of red-white-and-blue books describing the program are being distributed free at the convention hall and at political receptions. Press releases and information packets about the idea are widely available. And political aides scurry to arrange interviews with their bosses who are trying to win elections by running on the issue.    The importance of conventions may be diminishing but they remain a great showcase for issues on the make, and for good reason. There isn't a larger concentration of party officials, candidates and journalists in a single place, and politicians with a cause try to take advantage of this opportunity. Assembled here at the Democrats' conclave are more than 5,000 delegates and alternates, about 13,500 media people and thousands of hangers-on eager to find something fresh in the fast-paced world of politics.    The convention &quot;is a good forum -- modest but useful,&quot; Sen. Nunn says.    Other issues are being pushed to gain the spotlight here. The Children's Defense Fund, for example, held a news conference with Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young to endorse more federal funding for child care and prenatal health services. In addition, the group's director, Marian Wright Edelman, made a pitch for the extra spending during at least two other gatherings.    Sometimes such promotion pays off. At the 1984 Democratic convention, Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey handed out handfuls of copies of his book on tax overhaul and spoke personally to about 10 state delegations on the subject. Whenever he was interviewed, he was sure to plug the idea. Two years later, his once-laughed-at proposal became the basis for the new federal tax law.    Other times, convention efforts go nowhere. Opponents of immigration-law changes blanketed the Democrats' convention four years ago. But in Congress two years later, a sweeping revision of the immigration law was decisively approved.    Backers of national service want to follow in the footsteps of Sen. Bradley. &quot;I think it's going to be a very potent campaign issue,&quot; says Alvin From of the Democratic Leadership Council, which helped author Sen. Nunn's plan. &quot;Democrats from the most liberal to the most conservative can feed into it.&quot;    At the hearing, the breadth of the Democratic Party is represented. It ranges from liberal Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland to former Gov. Charles Robb of Virginia, a conservative. Already, a version of the idea has been introduced as legislation by California Rep. Leon Panetta, the future House Budget Committee chairman. And several politicians running for the Senate are campaigning on the issue, including Mr. Robb and Hubert Humphrey III of Minnesota.    The notion has its detractors. Some college administrators worry that their lifeblood of federal grants could dry up if student grants are tied to voluntary service. Some liberals deride the idea as a way to skirt the need to raise taxes to pay for social services long neglected by the Reagan administration. Others doubt that ever-individualistic Americans are interested in such altruism or whether taxpayers can afford to foot its multibillion-dollar cost.    The proposal, which its backers have called &quot;the new GI bill,&quot; would require youths to do some type of military or civilian public service in order to receive federal education grants. Participants in the &quot;Citizens Corps&quot; would be compensated with vouchers that could pay tuition or training costs or make down payments on homes.    Here at the convention, national service is being billed as an emblem of what is new about the Democrats. It embodies the Democrats' interest in making government more active again, and its advocates boast that it might save federal dollars in the long run by providing social services at lower cost. But most importantly, it is a vehicle for a new ethos that the Democrats hope to sell here: that a new era of civic responsibility is dawning.    &quot;National service is serving your country rather than serving yourself,&quot; says Fred Wetheimer, president of the self-styled citizens' lobby, Common Cause, and a supporter of the concept.    So far, it hasn't caught fire. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democrats' presidential nominee, is hesitant to endorse the notion of a full-blown program of national service. But prominent Democrats such as Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton have been talking to him about it. &quot;I'm fairly sure that Dukakis won't embrace the idea in its full form,&quot; Gov. Clinton says. But he adds: &quot;You're going to see parts of it spring up over and over and over again in the election and after the election.&quot;    For his part, Sen. Nunn is taking his show on the road, and intends to hold public forums like the one here throughout the country before he introduces legislation of his own. &quot;It's an idea whose time has come,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
