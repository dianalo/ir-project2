Under the judge's ruling Wednesday, Virginia and Stephen LaLondewill share joint physical custody of the child effective July 9. Thegirl will be with her father four days a week and with her motherthe rest of the week.   Lalonde was given sole legal custody.   Beth Herr, Ms. LaLonde's attorney, said an appeal was planned,adding: ``It's certainly a unique decision for a case of thisnature.''   The couple's fight over custody of their daughter, Nicole, wentto trial in May 1988 before Suffolk County Probate Judge MaryFitzpatrick in Boston.   A central issue was whether Nicole was abused by her father.Virginia LaLonde and Nicole claimed the child had been abused byhim. LaLonde has denied sexually abusing his daughter.   The judge ruled Wednesday no sign of sexual abuse existed asNicole has claimed.   The ruling gives Stephen LaLonde sole legal custody to determinesuch matters as where Nicole attends school and her day-to-day care.Nicole asked to see both parents regularly and a schedule of visitshas been worked out.   ``The idea is to give Nicole as much access as possible,'' saidPeter DiGangi, LaLonde's lawyer.   His client, he said, ``is elated.''   Ms. LaLonde must report to a probation officer every day thatNicole is in her care. The judge also ordered that Nicole continuesessions with a therapist treating her for more than a year.   Ms. Herr said an appeal would be based on claims the ruling is``against the weight of the evidence of the case.''   DiGangi said an appeal would be unfortunate.   ``We're sorry that Virginia wishes to continue on thelitigation,'' he said. ``It's time for Nicole to enjoy herchildhood, while she has it.''   The case drew national attention in 1987 when Ms. LaLonde spentsix months in the Framingham state prison for women rather thandisclose her daughter's whereabouts.   The wrangling over Nicole began three years after the LaLondes'1983 divorce when Ms. LaLonde accused her ex-husband of abusingtheir child during visits. A probate judge investigated the matterthen and decided the allegations were baseless.   Rather than allow LaLonde to have custody of his child in June1986, the mother and child fled the state. They settled in Florida.But in March 1987, Ms. LaLonde returned alone to Massachusetts tosettle the custody matter.   When Ms. LaLonde refused to say where Nicole was, a judge heldher in contempt of court and ordered her imprisoned until she woulddisclose the child's location.   The woman was freed only after a baby sitter in Durham, N.C.,tipped off police that the child was being sheltered by anunderground network of women.   In October 1987, Nicole was returned to Massachusetts and placedin the custody of the state Department of Social Services. After shewas examined and interviewed at Cambridge Hospital, the child wasplaced with a foster family.</TEXT></DOC>
