Dole spoke on Thursday shortly before the Senate voted 64-30 forthe measure, hours after the House approved it, 229-183. BothDemocratic-controlled chambers split along party lines as they sentthe bill to Reagan's desk.   Dole and Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate ArmedServices Committee, told their colleagues that Defense SecretaryFrank C. Carlucci had indicated Reagan was likely to sign the bill.   But Sen. Daniel Quayle, R-Ind., who made an unsuccessful attemptto strip the provisions Reagan disliked, said the administrationopposed the measure.   The bill permits $4 billion for the Strategic DefenseInitiative, as Reagan's 5-year-old Star Wars anti-missile programis formally known. That is slightly above the current SDI budget of$3.9 billion but far less than the $4.8 billion Reagan wanted.   As part of the Star Wars budget, the bill deeply reducedspending for the space-based interceptor, which is being developedas the first phase of an eventual SDI program. The Pentagon wanted$330 million for the program, but the bill restricts the total toonly $85 million.   The final measure was worked out by a House-Senate conferencecommittee and is a compromise between bills passed separately byeach chamber.   Shortly before the final vote, the Senate rejected, 58-35, aneffort by Quayle and other conservative Republicans to return thebill to a conference committee and strip out the Star Warsreductions and other arms control restrictions opposed by Reagan.   The bill authorizes Pentagon spending of $299.5 billion for thefiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The total is a slight reduction fromthe $301 billion authorized this year and marks the fourth straightyear of either freezes or reductions in the defense budget,following large increases during Reagan's first term.   Highlights of the bill:   ARMS CONTROL _ The measure requires withdrawal and retirement ofthree aging missile-firing Poseidon submarines as newmissile-firing boats are introduced into the fleet. That continuesthe policy of generally keeping the United States near weaponslimits imposed by the unratified SALT II nuclear treaty.   The bill also directs the Energy Department to prepare for acomprehensive treaty banning nuclear tests, a longtime goal of armscontrol supporters.   The measure bans flight testing of ``depressed trajectorymissiles'' as long as the Soviets refrain from testing theirversions of those weapons. Depressed trajectory weapons, which flyrelatively low, could be launched from submarines and couldtheoretically be launched off each nation's shores with relativelylittle warning time.   MILITARY-DRUGS _ The bill includes $300 million to increase themilitary's role in the anti-drug effort and orders the Pentagon toprovide more intelligence and tracking information to civilian lawenforcement agencies.   PAY RAISES _ The nation's 2.1 million uniformed militarypersonnel will receive a 4.1 percent pay increase. Reagan hadsought a 4.3 percent increase.   NUCLEAR WEAPONS _ The measure proposes $250 million each for thesingle-warhead Midgetman and the railroad version of the MX, a pairof land-based nuclear missiles. Reagan wanted only $200 million forthe Midgetman, which is strongly backed by Democrats, and $793million for the MX. The bill also contains $250 million that thesecretary of defense in the new administration next year can spendfor either program.   NAVY SHIPS _ The bill includes money for one more Tridentmissile-firing submarine, a pair of Los Angeles-class attack subs,the first of a new Seawolf class of attack subs, three destroyers,two oilers and an amphibious assault ship.   OTHER WEAPONS _ The measure provides money for 180 F-16 jetfighters, 36 F-15 fighters, a dozen F-14 jets for the Navy, 84FA-18 jets for Navy carriers, 24 AV-8 Harrier jets, four of the newlong-range C-17 cargo planes, 669 M-1 tanks, 581 Bradley FightingVehicles for the Army, 1,310 Standard missiles and 72 Apache attackhelicopters for the Army, 72 Blackhawk helicopters for the Army,1,310 Standard missiles, 261 of the top-line MK-48 torpedoes, 815Patriot air defense missiles, and 48,000 rockets for the Army'smultiple-launch rocket system.</TEXT></DOC>
