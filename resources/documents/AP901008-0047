It was the latest in a series of reports predicting some wouldbe freed this week.   In related development, a British newspaper quoted a Shiiteleader in Lebanon as saying the future of Western hostages shouldno longer be linked to that of Arab prisoners.   The paper, the Independent, said the statement could herald abreakthrough in efforts to secure the release of the 13 Westernersmissing and believed held hostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Shiitefundamentalists.   A series of news reports have predicted the release of foreignhostages following the restoration of British and Iraniandiplomatic ties in late September after an interruption of 19months.   The ties were broken during the dispute over Iranian deaththreats against British novelist Salman Rushdie.   President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran apparently has been seekingto free the hostages to help improve relations with the Westfollowing the June 1989 death of his country's fundamentalistpatriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Rafsanjani has been opposedby radicals in his own government.   The leftist Beirut newspaper, As-Safir, today quotedunidentified diplomats as saying the release of the Britishcaptives ``awaits the proper time.'' But it said arrangements forfreeing them have been put ``on a hot burner.''   It was impossible to verify the report. The paper is known tomaintain close links with leftist and fundamentalist Shiitefactions.   The Beirut paper said the fate of the foreign hostages alsodepends on the Lebanese government extending its authority to``greater Beirut,'' which includes the southern slums.   Those slums, where most of the Westerners are believed held, area stronghold for the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, theumbrella group for the captors.   The Syrian-backed government of President Elias Hrawi haspledged to spread its authority over all of Beirut as a step towardending the 15-year civil war.   In another report, the conservative newspaper Ad-Diyar saidSunday that an unidentified Iranian envoy had arrived in Beirut tocomplete preparations for freeing Anglican church envoy Terry Waite``in the next few days.''   Arab sources in Syria said Sunday that Syrian officials weremaking strenuous efforts to free some Westerners missing inLebanon.   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said SyrianForeign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa was trying hard ``to resolve theissue but was encountering unexpected obstacles.''   He did not elaborate, but he noted that Sharaa was expected tomeet soon with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati todiscuss the issue.   Ad-Diyar said Waite's release was expected to be ``the prefaceto releasing all British hostages in Lebanon.''   Waite, 51, the envoy of the archbishop of Canterbury,disappeared in west Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987. He had left his hotelfor a meeting with Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, the groupthat claims to hold American captives Terry Anderson and ThomasSutherland.   Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, is the longest-held foreign captive. He was kidnapped March16, 1985.   The other missing Britons are journalist John McCarthy, retiredpilot Jack Mann and writer Alec Collett.   The Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Moslems claimed in1986 that it hanged Collett in retaliation for Britain's support ofU.S. air raids on Libya. No body was produced, but Britishofficials believe Collett is dead.   In its report today, the Independent quoted Sheikh MohamedHussein Fadlallah as saying the hostage issue ``can be settled insuch a way that no party feels he has been blackmailed.''   The sheikh as described as the most important spiritual adviserto Hezbollah.   In the past, kidnappers have said the Western hostages won't allbe freed until the release of Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners inIsraeli jails and of Shiite extremists held in Kuwait.   Fadlallah said he believed, as earlier reports have indicated,that the 15 Moslems imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the French andU.S. embassies there in 1983 had escaped after the Iraqi Aug. 2invasion.   He said he believes they are no longer in Kuwait.   ``We call on every side that could do something about thishumanitarian issue to dissociate these two problems from eachother,'' the sheikh said.   The sheikh was also quoted as saying he had been interviewed byAnderson two days before the American reporter was abducted.   ``I tried very hard to help him on several occasions, and I wasunable to do so. But the change in the political atmosphere in theregion and in the world could bring about a happy result,'' thesheikh was quoted as saying.</TEXT></DOC>
