Perry</HL><DD> 12/04/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   Increasingly, politics is serious business, and this time around the presidential candidates in both parties seem dedicated to the importance of being earnest.    Too bad. Politics ought to be fun. In the words of one sage, we should never forget &quot;its high capacity to soothe and tickle the midriff, its incomparable services as a maker of entertainment.&quot;    Indeed. Let us not forget the bloopers and the blunders that have made us all laugh, and wince. Even earnest young politicians can give us a laugh -- unintentionally.    Years from now, those of us desperate for a laugh will cherish memories of the ways in which both Gary Hart and Joe Biden were hoisted by their own petards.    Think of it. Former Sen. Hart, the new-ideas politician of the age, brought down even as he was asking the press to stalk him just to prove he lived like a monk. Reporters from Miami staked out his house and discovered Donna Rice.    And Sen. Biden, the Democratic Demosthenes, unhorsed for borrowing class-conscious lines from a celebrated speech by Neil Kinnock, long-winded leader of Great Britain's socialist party. It turned out, too, that Mr. Biden really wasn't the student at college and law school he had said he was. &quot;I exaggerate when I get angry,&quot; said the senator, in a line that would have sent H.L. Mencken running for his trusty Corona typewriter.    The Messrs. Hart and Biden weren't the first victims of campaign gaffes, nor will they be the last. Blunders and bloopers have a long and -- to tell the truth -- honorable tradition. To err, after all, is human. Politicians, especially since the advent of the ubiquitous TV eye, tend to err in very public ways.    Remember these?    ---   Tom Dewey's &quot;Victory Special&quot; campaign train always ran on time and without a hitch. But, one day, pulling away from a whistle stop, it jerked mightily. &quot;What's the matter with that idiot engineer?&quot; Gov. Dewey exclaimed. Railway workers found that objectionable.    ---   In the same vein, Vice President George Bush -- his presidential campaign in deep trouble in Michigan -- recently told reporters that when hot-shot mechanics who keep Russian tanks humming run out of work, they should be sent to Detroit &quot;because we could use that kind of ability.&quot; American autoworkers were not amused.    ---   &quot;I don't believe,&quot; said President Ford in his second debate with Jimmy Carter, &quot;that the Yugoslavians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union. I don't consider that the Romanians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union. I don't believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.&quot; President Ford clearly was a man who had never celebrated Captive Nations Week.    ---   Speaking of Mr. Carter, remember the Playboy interview, when he admitted he &quot;lusted&quot; in his heart after other women? Or when he went to Poland and the translator told a puzzled crowd that he had &quot;lust&quot; for Poles? What he had said was that he had a &quot;desire&quot; to be in Poland.    ---   Dwight Eisenhower was asked at a press conference what important decisions his vice president, Richard Nixon, had helped to make. &quot;Give me a week,&quot; said the president.    ---   &quot;I am 1,000% for Tom Eagleton and have no intention of dropping him from the ticket,&quot; said George McGovern, in a brief statement to reporters following revelations that Mr. Eagleton had undergone electroshock therapy. But of course, Mr. Eagleton had to go, and go he did.    He was replaced on the ticket by Sargent Shriver, who endeared himself to reporters by walking into a rough-and-tumble workingman's bar and ordering a Courvoisier.    ---   &quot;When I came back from Vietnam,&quot; Gov. George Romney of Michigan told a television interviewer, &quot;I had just had the greatest brainwashing that anybody can get when you go over to Vietnam.&quot; Former Sen. Eugene McCarthy, commenting on Mr. Romney's brainwashing, said he thought &quot;a light rinse would have been sufficient.&quot;    ---   &quot;This is your last delivery, dear,&quot; said Vic Gold, Barry Goldwater's assistant press secretary, after uncovering Moira O'Connor, a Democratic spy, on the Goldwater campaign train. Ms. O'Connor had been distributing copies of a bogus newsletter to reporters. In those days, right-wingers believed that water treated with fluoride was a dangerous left-wing conspiracy; Ms. O'Connor's newsletter cheerfully assured everyone that fluoride had not been added to the train's water supply.    Instead of keeping the infiltrator under wraps, they unceremoniously dumped Miss O'Connor off the train at Parkersburg, W.Va., to whoops of joy from reporters who had been attracted by Mr. Gold's cries of outrage.    ---   Vice President Spiro Agnew didn't help his cause by calling a reasonably svelte Baltimore Sun reporter of Oriental extraction &quot;the fat Jap.&quot; Not much better was his remark that if &quot;you've seen one slum you've seen them all.&quot;    ---   Henry Cabot Lodge, running ceremonially for vice president, told a Harlem crowd that Richard Nixon, as president, would put a Negro in the Cabinet. Nixon was left to offend everyone by saying he was pledged to no such thing.    ---   Late at the end of a long campaign day, Ronald Reagan slipped his moorings and began expounding a theory that plants and trees are major sources of air pollution. On his next campaign swing, he was greeted by a banner hanging from a large tree. &quot;Chop me before I kill again,&quot; it read.    ---   Has a blooper ever cost a candidate the presidency? Maybe so. Republican James G. Blaine was doing nicely in New York state, a key to the 1884 election, until he strolled into the Fifth Avenue Hotel on the morning of Oct. 29 to speak to a meeting of Protestant ministers. Mr. Blaine, of Irish descent, wasn't listening when he was introduced by the Rev. Samuel D. Burchard. Politicians seldom listen to introductions. &quot;We are Republicans,&quot; Mr. Burchard said, &quot;and don't propose to leave our party and identify ourselves with the party whose antecedents have been rum, Romanism and rebellion.&quot;    If Mr. Blaine had been a little more alert, he could have dissociated himself from those fatal words. But he wasn't, and said nothing. He lost New York by 1,149 votes, and the election to Grover Cleveland.    ---   Mr. Perry reports on politics from The Wall Street Journal's Washington bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
