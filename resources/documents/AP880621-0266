A judge was to be selected Monday in this southern French cityto hear the case against Duvalier, accused of misappropriating $120million in public funds.   In Haiti's capital of Port-au-Prince on Monday, Lt. Gen. HenriNamphy re-established military rule by decree and named his owngovernment a few hours after ousting President Leslie Manigat'scivilian government.   The coup crushed hopes for the democracy promised two years agoafter Duvalier was toppled, ending his family's 29-yeardictatorship.   ``We are not lawyers for the government but for the Haitianstate,'' said attorney Yann Colin, who represents Haiti in itsFrench legal proceedings.   In April a French court ruled it had jurisdiction in the caseagainst Duvalier.   The Haitian national lottery, office of vehicle insurance,gaming commission and Port-au-Prince Bank are demanding thatDuvalier and members of his entourage reimburse the government.   Colin claimed the $120 million requested represents only part ofwhat Duvalier diverted.   Since arriving in France Feb. 7, 1986, Duvalier has lived withhis wife, Michelle, and other family members in a luxurious mansionin southern France rented from Saudi millionaire Adnan Kashoggi.   Duvalier has declined to comment on political developments inHaiti since his downfall.</TEXT></DOC>
