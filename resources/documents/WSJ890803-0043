The report, by researchers at Rockefeller University, New York, is the first to explain previous studies that found that Tagamet causes annoying side effects in some men such as breast enlargement and reduced sex drive. But the study also hinted that Tagamet may have a role in treating osteoporosis in women.    The side effect in men is rare -- occurring in about 2% of patients who use the drug for more than six months -- and it's reversible. But Glaxo Holdings PLC of Britain has exploited the problem to help vault its own ulcer drug Zantac ahead of Tagamet in one of the pharmaceutical industry's biggest marketing wars ever -- a battle of billion-dollar ulcer drugs.    The report doesn't alter the substance of that battle, but its prominent appearance as the lead study in today's New England Journal of Medicine is certain to be seen by doctors and to be used by SmithKline's competitors, including Glaxo and Rahway, N.J.-based Merck andamp; Co., which markets Pepcid as an ulcer drug.    In their running battle, Glaxo and SmithKline each have exploited the publication of scientific studies supporting their own product or questioning the competitor's product. The market for the drugs is so sensitive to the publication of such studies that in this case, New England Journal editors requested revisions to the study to ensure fairness, one of the authors said. Tagamet, or cimetidine as it is known generically, and Zantac, or ranitidine, were the only drugs tested in the study. The stakes are huge. Tagamet hit the market in 1976 and quickly became the biggest-selling prescription drug in the world, peaking at sales of $1.13 billion in 1987. Zantac was marketed by Glaxo in early 1980s and rapidly eclipsed Tagamet, partly on claims that it lacked some of Tagamet's side effects. At the end of 1988, Zantac was the top-selling drug, with sales of about $2 billion a year. Tagamet sales were about $1 billion last year, in the range of what the company expects for 1989.    The study's key finding is that Tagamet interferes with the body's ability to process the sex hormone, estrogen. This interference causes a buildup of a form of estrogen that leads to the breast-enlargement problem in some men. But for this same reason, the drug may be beneficial in preventing osteoporosis in women. That disease, common in post-menopausal women and characterized by sometimes crippling bone loss, is caused by lack of estrogen.    &quot;The side effect may actually have therapeutic value,&quot; said Jon J. Michnovicz, now medical director of the Institute for Hormone Research and co-author of the study with Richard A. Galbraith of Rockefeller University. Studies are under way with post-menopausal women, Dr. Michnovicz said, and early indications are that women are affected in much the same way as men. &quot;The area is definitely wide open for discovery,&quot; he said.    In a statement, SmithKline said the study &quot;doesn't contain new clinical information and doesn't conflict with current prescribing information for cimetidine.&quot; The Philadelphia-based company also said that in addition to osteoporosis, the study shows Tagamet may also have potential in cancer treatment.    In the study, nine healthy men took 800-milligram doses of Tagamet twice a day, about double the normal clinical dose, for two weeks. These volunteers had a 40% reduction in their ability to break down estradiol, a form of estrogen, and a 20% increase in blood levels of the hormone, the researchers found. In a second phase of the experiment, six men were given more common clinical doses of 400 milligrams twice a day for one week. These volunteers still had a 33% reduction in metabolizing the hormone.    By contrast, seven men who took 150 milligram doses of ranitidine daily for two weeks had no significant changes in processing the hormone, a finding that was expected because ranitidine hadn't previously been linked to the effects.    Tagamet and Zantac are known as H2 antagonists in that they help heal ulcers by blocking the action of histamine, a hormone-like chemical that triggers the release of stomach acid. </TEXT></DOC>
