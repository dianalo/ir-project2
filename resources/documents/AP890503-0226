If the puppies survive, they will be the first Texas-born redwolves since the mid-1970s, raising the total population to 92,said officials at Fossil Rim Wildlife Center.   In 1973, after the passage of the Endangered Species Act, theentire red wolf population in southeast Texas and Louisiana wascaptured to prevent its extinction.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service captured about 40 red wolvesand began a recovery program in Washington state.   The black-footed ferret is the only mammal that is rarer thanthe red wolf in the United States.   Fossil Rim, a research and education center that is involved inthe propagation of eight endangered species, received four red wolfbreeding pair in February.   ``We are sure a second female will produce a litter within thenext week to 10 days,'' said Dr. Evan Blumer, a Fossil Rimveterinarian.   The puppies were estimated to weigh about 14 ounces, but FossilRim officials said they would not be sexed or examined untilThursday or Friday.   The red wolf is smaller than the grey wolf, with femalesweighing 40-60 pounds and males weighing 60-80 pounds.   The wolf ranged from Texas east to the Atlantic coast and northto the Ohio valley, but began disappearing because of theirinability to adapt to changes in the land and predator control.</TEXT></DOC>
