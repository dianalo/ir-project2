The Oliver Stone movie &quot;JFK&quot; is a disgraceful concoctionof lies and distortions designed, among other things, toleave the impression that there was a massive conspiracyamong all elements of American society -- government,business, the media -- to kill President Kennedy, and thatone of the conspirators was President Johnson. The movie maymake Mr. Stone and Time-Warner lots of money, but it is stilla big lie.   The film is particularly offensive with respect toJohnson, who called the Kennedy assassination &quot;the foulestdeed of our time&quot; and said when he faced a joint session ofCongress shortly thereafter, &quot;All I have I would have givengladly not to be standing here today.&quot; In addition to workingas Lyndon Johnson's closest domestic aide for three and ahalf years, I have spent the past four years researching andwriting &quot;The Triumph and Tragedy of Lyndon Johnson.&quot;   Johnson believed, as he said to me, that Fidel Castro wasresponsible for Kennedy's assassination. In a reference toattempts by the Kennedy brothers to assassinate Castro,Johnson told me, &quot;Kennedy tried to get Castro, but Castro gotKennedy first.&quot; After assuming the presidency, Johnsonordered a stop to all covert activity to eliminate Castro.Moreover, LBJ was so convinced that Castro assassinatedKennedy that he asked the FBI to take special precautions toprotect him and his family from an attempt by Castro on hisown life. Johnson did not agree with the Warren Commission'sreport that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. In late 1966 andearly 1967, he discussed with me reopening the investigation,but decided against it because he did not believe it was inthe interests of the country and he did not want to inflictany additional pain on the Kennedy family.   Mr. Stokes, you did take the time in a thorough Houseinquiry to re-examine the Warren Commission findings andconduct your own investigation. In these circumstances -- andparticularly with this scurrilous film giving millions ofyoung Americans a false revisionist history lesson -- Ibelieve it is imperative that the House open to the publicall the files accumulated in the course of yourinvestigation.   Joseph A. Califano Jr.   New York   ---   In dispelling Oliver Stone's myth of the Kennedyassassination (&quot;`JFK': Truth and Fiction,&quot; editorial page,Jan. 10), Arthur Schlesinger Jr. seeks to perpetuate one ofhis own: that JFK would or could have removed U.S. troopsfrom Vietnam. In recounting the Vietnam policies of theKennedy administration, Mr. Schlesinger omits its complicityin the Diem assassination and the coup d'etat thatdestabilized the country, forcing American troops to head offchaos.   Defenders of President Kennedy find themselves in thecurious position of arguing that their hero was sopolitically obtuse and morally reprehensible that he wouldconspire to kill an ally, destabilize a struggling ThirdWorld country and then walk away without any sense ofresponsibility. Even JFK's most virulent detractors give himmore credit than that.   Fifty-eight thousand Americans died for the sins of theKennedy administration. The only conspiracy in November 1963was the one to which the president was a party, not a victim.   Thomas F. Berner   New York   ---   Mr. Schlesinger argues that President Kennedy's plan towithdraw 1,000 U.S. advisers by the end of 1963, as part of&quot;winding down the Cold War,&quot; was reversed by Lyndon Johnsonwhen he signed National Security Action Memorandum 273 onNov. 26, 1963, calling, Mr. Schlesinger says, for the&quot;maintenance of American military programs in Vietnam atlevels as high as before. . . .&quot;   NSAM 273 does not contain the words &quot;at levels as high.&quot;Perhaps Mr. Schlesinger is thinking of the provision in NSAM273 that &quot;Programs of military and economic assistance shouldbe maintained at such levels that their magnitude andeffectiveness in the eyes of the Vietnamese Government do notfall below the levels sustained by the United States in thetime of the Diem Government.&quot; But this same provision, wordedidentically, was in McGeorge Bundy's draft of NSAM 273(declassified in 1991) that had been prepared for Kennedy onNov. 21.   NSAM 273 as approved by Johnson and the Bundy draft forKennedy also contained an identical provision reaffirming thewithdrawal plan: &quot;The objectives of the United States withrespect to the withdrawal of U.S. military personnel remainas stated in the White House statement of October 2, 1963.&quot;   William Conrad Gibbons   Visiting Professor   Department of Public Affairs   George Mason University   Fairfax, Va.   (Mr. Gibbons is author of &quot;The U.S. Government and theVietnam War.&quot;)   ---   Mr. Schlesinger unintentionally illustrates the mostsignificant point of all: &quot;President Kennedy subsequentlytold Sen. Mansfield that total withdrawal {from Vietnam} wasthe right course, but he could not do it until after the 1964election. Otherwise, he feared, the Republicans might beathim in 1964 over the `loss' of Indochina as they had beatenthe Democrats in 1952 over the `loss' of China.&quot;   Ain't it the truth] Whatever may be right for the country;however many lives might be unnecessarily lost in themeantime; all is subordinate to the politician holding ontohis office and his power.   Is it any wonder the public won't swallow the report ofthe politicians who made up the Warren Commission?   Harold C. Bennett   Morrisville, N.Y.</TEXT></DOC>
