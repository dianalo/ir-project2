North and threeco-defendants are sometimes as perplexing to the lawyers and thejudge as they are to the general public.   A continuing legal battle is being fought on several frontsbetween independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh and lawyers forNorth, former national security adviser John W. Poindexter and armsdealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord.   Here are some answers to a number of questions about the case:   Q. Who is charged with what?   A. All four defendants are charged with conspiring to defraudthe government, theft of government property and wire fraud in thediversion of profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to theNicaraguan rebels.   Poindexter and North are both charged with lying to Congress.North also faces charges of obstructing a presidential inquiry,with pocketing $4,300 in travelers' checks a Contra leader gave himto cover expenses, with accepting an illegal gratuity in the formof a $15,000 high-security fence around his home, with obstructingan FBI inquiry into the fence, and with conspiring to illegally usea tax-exempt foundation to raise money to help arm the Contras.   Secord and Hakim are charged with conspiring to py illegalgratuities to North by setting up a $200,000 fund for North'sfamily and by arranging installation of the fence.   Q: When is the case going to trial?   A: That is still up in the air. But U.S. District Judge GerhardA. Gesell said last week that the defendants should be triedindividually so that he could ensure they each get a fair trial.Gesell said he would decide major pre-trial issues by July 1. Thefirst trial likely will begin during the fall presidential campaign.   Q. Who goes first?   A. Walsh designated North as the leadoff defendant, to befollowed by Poindexter.   Q. Why did Gesell order four separate trials?   A. The judge was presented with a unique problem because threeof the four defendants _ North, Poindexter and Hakim _ testifiedlast year before congressional hearings under grants of limitedimmunity from prosecution. As a rule, Walsh is prevented from usingthe testimony of the defendants against them as evidence.   Q. What does that have to do with holding four separate trials?   A. Gesell ruled that each defendant has a right to present aco-defendant's immunized testimony as evidence of his innocence. Ifa joint trial were held, Gesell would have to choose betweenprotecting, say, Poindexter's Fifth Amendment right not to have hiscongressional testimony used against him and the Sixth Amendmentright of Hakim and Secord to use Poindexter's statements toCongress as evidence of their innocence.   Secord and Hakim, both say that testimony by North andPoindexter would help clear them of any wrongdoing by showing thatthey acted with the understanding their activities were approved bythe U.S. government.   Q. Is Gesell's order a blow to the prosecution?   A. Prosecutors don't generally like trying conspiracy casesagainst individual defendants. It's easier to show a jury how theactions of each member furthered an alleged conspiracy if all thedefendants are being tried together. It means Walsh's resourceswill be seriously stretched and the cases will take a long time totry.   Q: What are the remaining issues before Gesell can set a trialdate?   A: The judge must decide whether the immunized congressionaltestimony of North, Poindexter and Hakim tainted the investigationof prosecutors. But his decision to hold four trials appears toforeshadow a decision that congressional immunity won't be abarrier to trying the case.   Gesell also has to rule on whether procedures for handling200,000 pages of classified documents collected during Walsh'sinvestigation will protect the defendants' rights to a fair trial.   Q. What are those?   A. The Classified Information Procedures Act requires thedefense to notify the prosecution before trial of any governmentsecrets it expects to use as evidence in the case. Defense lawyerscontend this will tip off the prosecution.   Q. Can the court force the government to declassify secretdocuments needed for the trials?   A. No. If there is a large enough volume of material that thegovernment agencies won't release, Walsh would be forced to dropthe case.   If the government determines that a particular document is sosensitive it can't be made public, the law provides several waysfor the information to be presented. The court can order astatement of what the document would prove, can substitute astatement of facts that a document would prove for the actualmaterial, or the judge can also delete sensitive portions of thematerial.   Q: What sorts of secrets are involved?   A: The keepers of government secrets are especially sensitiveabout any document that reveals the source of foreign intelligence.The government also is anxious to protect information revealingthat a foreign country provided information or was involved in asecret initiative with the United States.   Gesell speculated at a hearing that the defendants may want tointroduce evidence about other covert operations they engaged in toshow that the procedures were no different than those followed inthe Iran-Contra affair.   The judge said evidence about other secret operations might helpthe defendants show they acted with authority or at least thebelief they had the permission of higher officials.</TEXT></DOC>
