Typical problems include: catalyst poisoning and deactivation;high hydrogen consumption in processing; fouling of catalytic crackingunits; intermediate stream instability, compatibility, and corrosiveness;higher probability of toxicity and mutagenicity of products; unpredictableproduct slate; inaccurate process designs; high process energy requirements;and product instability, corrosiveness, and failure to meet specifications.All of these point to the need for a better understanding of the chemistryof the heavy crudes, and an adequate data base for the design of newprocesses. The National Institute for Petroleum and Energy Research (NIPER)has initiated a program for developing the technology background necessaryto make the transition to a heavy oil-based industry. This program isconcerned with composition of heavy oils and fractions derived from them,thermodynamics of compounds occurring in or produced from heavy oil,processing, and product quality. Although each of these is addressedby projects with individual goals, they fit together and support eachother in combining to form a technical foundation for heavy oil refiningtechnology. Although the chemistry of heavy oils (the compounds and theirreactions) is the unifying element, the purpose is to provide technologyfor the engineering developments necessary to produce our transportationfuel requirements from heavy oils. 94 refs., 59 figs., 73 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
