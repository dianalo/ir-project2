The cream, containing 0.025% of the active ingredient, tretinoin, will be available by the end of the month, said officials at the New Brunswick, N.J., health-care concern's Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. unit, which markets Retin-A. The prescription cream will sell for the same price as stronger formulations, $25 to $30 a tube.    The announcement likely will cheer customers who have been buying Retin-A to treat wrinkles, despite a tendency of the cream to irritate the skin. Ortho said it plans to seek Food and Drug Administration approval to sell the anti-acne drug as a wrinkle cream later this year.    An Ortho spokeswoman said that since January -- when the Journal of the American Medical Association suggested Retin-A, on the market 17 years to treat acne, could help smooth wrinkles -- sales of the 0.05% Retin-A have risen 40% in the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
