Republicans crafted an anti-tax hike, anti-abortion platform afew blocks from their New Orleans convention hall, and voted toproclaim themselves the champion of women as well as minorities.Public opinion polls show Bush trailing Dukakis badly among womenvoters.   ``Let's be honest,'' Republican chairman Frank Fahrenkopf saidin a speech to the party's national committee. ``Last monthbelonged to Michael Dukakis and the Democrats. They had their show,they had their laughs, but the last laugh is still the bestlaugh...This campaign now belongs to us.''   Republicans also said they have $13.5 million cash on handtoward a goal of $70 million or more to help elect Bush and otherGOP candidates this fall.   The cavernous Superdome where Republicans will nominate Bush andhis as-yet unknown vice presidential running mate was still aconstruction zone. Thousands of red-backed chairs were installed onthe floor beneath a huge podium. Workmen laid what seemed likemiles of red carpet to cover the temporary walkways.   The most recent public opinion poll gave Bush cause for cheer.   A Gallup poll gave Dukakis an edge over Bush of 49 percent to 42percent in a survey taken Aug. 5-7. That contrasts with a 17-pointDukakis bulge in the days immediately following the DemocraticNational Convention in July.   There was little doubt that the GOP platform committee wassketching a conservative blueprint for America, and at least oneparticipant was unhappy. ``This is the last platform hurrah,believe me, of the far right,'' said liberal Sen. Lowell Weicker ofConnecticut.   The platform committee refined one plank to say Republicans are``the natural champion of blacks, minorities, women and ethnicAmericans.'' In agreeing to the change, they overrode an objectionof James Summers of Bellevue, Wash., who said the revision amountedto ``absolutely pandering to a single constituency where we appear,according to the pollsters, to be having a problem.''   The early platform draft also called for ``rapid and certaindeployment'' of Star Wars. The vice president has urged deployment``as soon as feasible.''   Republicans also released what they said was a GOP staffestimate of the cost of the implicit promises of the Democraticplatform _ $43.1 billion in 1989 alone. Ironically, Bush hascriticized the Democrats for drafting a platform that lacked anyspecifics.</TEXT><HEAD>The only suspense: pickup 8th graf a0653</HEAD></DOC>
