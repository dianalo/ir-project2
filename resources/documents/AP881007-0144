The laboratory will research and produce plants through geneticengineering and tissue culture.   Tourists on the boat ride through Epcot Center's Land Pavilionwill be able to observe technicians working to develop new plantvarieties and improve food crops to speed growth, increase yieldsand become pest- and drought-resistant.   The U.S. Department of Agriculture donated the equipment used inthe lab, which was financed by Kraft Inc., sponsor of the LandPavilion.   ``It's a splendid educational effort,'' said AgricultureSecretary Richard Lyng, who participated in dedication ceremonies.   ``This is a small lab, an exhibit. ... We don't want tooveremphasize its importance, but it is on the cutting edge ofbiotechnology and the value is in people getting a chance to see''work carried out in this important field, Lyng said.   Up to 25,000 people a day go through the Land Pavilion and mosttake the ride that circles the lab.
