The trade group said that gas reserve additions in 1990totaled 105% to 128% of output. Reserve additions arecalculated by adding discoveries and extensions of existingfields and then subtracting consumption. The increase camedespite low prices that have discouraged new drilling andhave been driving some independents out of business.</LP><TEXT>   Association President Michael Baly cited improved drillingtechnology, which allows producers to get more from existingfields. The 1990 figure compares with average &quot;replacementslevels&quot; of 93% from 1981-1989, when producers didn't find asmuch gas as the nation consumed.</TEXT></DOC>
