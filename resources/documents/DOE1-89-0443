The increase accounts foranother improvement of the position the Soviet Union holds on the WesternEuropean petroleum and gas markets. Of late, it was covering a seventhof each, petroleum and natural gas demands, in the European Communities.However, slumping oil prices caused the Soviet Union financial lossesin the order of magnitude of US-Dollar 5 billions, the result of whichwas a marked reduction of the USSR petroleum and natural gas share inthe exports to western countries from almost 75% (1985) to 62%. The above-mentionedincrease in petroleum and natural gas exports was mainly due to the positivedevelopment of domestic petroleum and natural gas extraction. Slumpingoil prices are also held responsible for an increase in compensatoryoil imports. The still rather poor energy conservation results root inthe lacking financial and material incentives. Upon Gorbatchev's requestfor lifting energy prices which for years have been kept low artificially,adequate plans and schemes have meanwhile been passed by the CentralCommittee of the Communist Party.</TEXT></DOC>
