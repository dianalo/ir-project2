 There were plentyof new video capture boards, upgrades of existing software, and firmsentering the market with lower prices or better features than alreadyestablished products.andP;  Amidst the plethora of multimedia hype there was someinteresting stuff.andM;Sony's video controller.andP;  By far the most interesting new multimedia productat Macworld was Sony's video controller, the Vbox.andP;  It enables a Macintosh tocontrol video devices.andP;  While this is hardly a revolutionary idea, no one hadyet implemented it with the Mac at consumer electronics prices.andP;  For $249 perinterface (you need one Vbox per device) and a little software, you can turnyour Macintosh into a videotape editing system or use &quot;print to video&quot; tooutput multimedia presentations onto video.andM;The sytem integrates Sony's protocol language, ViSCA (video systems controlarchitecture), which offers one-way communications to video devices thatsupport the architecture.andP;  At first, the facility will be available only onSony equipment.andP;  Most Sony video devices manufactured in the last few yearsalready have the architecture and connector built in.andP;  We expect othermanufacturers to start integrating it into their devices.andM;Apple has endorsed the ViSCA protocol and will soon support it at anoperating system level.andP;  A few multimedia manufacturers, among them Farallonand MacroMind, already offer support for the device.andM;To operate the device for videotape editing, you must use a two-way protocol,LANC, which is also supplied on the Vbox.andP;  LANC requires a differentconnector from ViSCA, but the ViSCA language will still be used with LANCdevices.andM;You can daisy-chain up to seven Vboxes for controlling additional videodevices.andP;  The Vbox is to be released this spring.andM;Pixar's image composition.andP;  Showplace, from Pixar, is a three-dimensionalpicture composition program.andP;  Unlike many products for three-dimensionaldrawing, Showplace does not support animation.andP;  It is designed to be aneasy-to-use product for composing single images.andM;The user imports 3D objects from any number of modeling packages or fromFirst ClipObjects, a set of objects included with the program.andP;  Tools areprovided that allow the user to arrange these objects.andM;Each object is given a &quot;look,&quot; a surface definition that governs the object'sappearance: wood, glass, metal, stone, etc.andP;  A package of looks calledFirstLooks is also included.andP;  Light sources and a viewer (a camera) areadded, and then the image is rendered using MacRenderMan.andM;Showplace will be availble in February for $695.andP;  FirstLooks, which can alsobe used for looks in the MacRenderMan product, will be available separatelyin March.andP;  Its pricing was not disclosed.andM;E-Machines' video frame-grabber.andP;  QuickView Studio, from E-Machines, is avideo frame-grabber with a few new bells and whistles.andP;  The most important isthe ability to capture entire sequences of video.andM;Users of video capture boards have often complained that it is difficult tocapture the &quot;right&quot; frame as it is moving by at 30 frames per second.andP;  Thetwo most common problems are capturing the wrong frame or capturing one thathas a lot of movement and is blurry.andP;  Using QuickView Studio's sequencefeature, the user specifies how many frames to grab and at what frequency(every frame, every other frame, every fourth, etc.).andP;  It is then easy to goback and pick the best of the lot.andM;Other featuress include masking and overlay of text on live video and viewingmultiple windows from different sources simultaneously.andP;  Inputs include RGB,composite video and S-VHS in either NTSC or PAL format.andM;An optional plug-in daughterboard is vailable for the QuickView Studio:QuickView Sound, which brings sound in from the video sources.andP;  The sound isfully digitized (8-bit resolution) at a sampling rate of 22 KHZ and is fullycompatible with the Macintosh Sound Manager.andM;QuickView Studio carries a suggested price of $2,495 and is availabe now.andO;QuickView Sound will be available in March for $395.andM;Mapping from scanned images.andP;  Cashing in on its popularity in the world offashion desing, ModaCad now offers Envesion, a unique surface mappingapplication.andP;  Unlike rendering packages that require 3D wireframe models,Envision can use a scanned image as its model.andP;  It uses a sophisticatedknowledge-based modeler to determine the surface topology of the scannedimage.andP;  Once this is done, you can apply new textures and finishes to theimage.andM;The demos shown at Macworld were impressive.andP;  The program really can figureout the topology of an image with great precision.andP;  We hasten to add,however, that the demonstrator was not allowed to deviate from her script atall, so we could only view the package at arm's length.andM;Another interesting product was ModaVision, a 3D modeling package that usesstereoscopic glasses so that the designer can work in a pseudo-3Denvironment.andM;Envision lists for $2,000.andP;  Pricing and availability of Moda Vision were notreleased.andM;Canon still-video kit.andP;  In an attempt to jump-start the flounderingstill-video market, Canon has released a package that should be excellent forlow-end and industrial publishing applications where high-resolution imagingis not neccessary.andM;The Canon Still-Video Computer Imaging Kit bundles the Canon XapShotpoint-and-shoot camera, Digital Visions's ComputerEyes video digitizer andsoftware to create a system for capturing and importing still-video images.andO;The XapShot operates only in field mode.andP;  This means that it can fit 50images on a standard 2&quot; still video disk.andP;  However, these images have onlyhalf the resolution of a full video frame (240 lines vertically rather than480).andP;  The ComputerEyes digitizer connects directly to the camera, using thecamer's internal floppy drive to feed data back to the computer.andP;  Includedsoftware lets the user adjust brightness, contrast, hue and color and to saveeach image in PICT, TIFF of MacPain format.andM;The system is available in five configurations: Mac II color, Mackblack-and-white, PC color, PC black-and-white and Apple IIGS color.andP;  Theprice si $1,099 for the Mac or PC color version, $899 for the Mac or Pcblack-and-white version and $899 for the IIGS version.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
