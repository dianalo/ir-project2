That is when the 12 nations of the European Economic Communityopen their borders to each other, take down old trade barriers andbecome more closely linked.   More than 200 princes, counts and other bluebloods from 11countries gathered here recently for the 12th congress of theInformation and Liaison Commission of European Nobility Associationsto redefine their mission in the modern world and they had a lot tosay about their places in Europe after 1992.   Addressing the congress at an upper-crust Oporto Hotel, BaronBernard Snoy of Belgium said noble traditions of cosmopolitanspirit, courage, selflessness and the motto ``jamais mediocre''(never mediocre) meant ancient families should provide social, moraland cultural leadership.   He added that 1992 will be ``a unique occasion ... for (our)families to rediscover their identity and renew their `raisond'etre'.''   The congress was conducted in French.   Snoy noted proudly that a dozen nobles already are members of the518-member European Parliament and many are fully integrated inother EEC institutions, such as the Court of Justice and theEuropean Investment Bank.   Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalgeri, born of Austrian and Japaneseparents in Bohemia, now part of Czechoslovakia, produced the firstmodern project for a united Europe in his book ``Pan Europe,''published in 1923. In 1946, he founded the European ParliamentaryUnion, a precursor of today's European Parliament.   Otto von Habsburg, son of Emperor Charles and the Empress Zita,the Austro-Hungarian monarchs, succeeded Kalgeri as president of thePan-European Union in 1973.   Habsburg, who was re-elected to the European Parliament in June,favors the adoption of EEC passports for people of the 12 membernations _ Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, West Germany, Greece,Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.   He maintains EEC must expand and ``keep its doors open to allEuropean peoples.''   Said Prince Johannes zu Loewenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg, presidentof the West German Association of Aristocratic Unions: ``As Europegrows together, aristocracy definitely has something to contribute.We've always been more European than narrowly nationalist.''   Loewenstein, whose ancestors hobnobbed with modern Germany'sfounding father, Prince Otto von Bismarck, cited the habit ofFrance's King Louis XIV of inviting English gentlemen to supper,even when the two countries were at war.   He noted that the Habsburg Emperor Franz Joseph ``even lentSerbia's chief of staff his personal carriage to leave Austria whenthey went to war in 1914.''   A landowner and consultant for a private bank in Frankfurt inWest Germany, the silver-haired Loewenstein said German nobility arecareful not to make potentially controversial political statements.He refused to comment, for example, on the question of reunificationof Germany.   Standing next to blue and gold heraldic tapestries outside thecongress hall, the Russian Prince Serge Obolensky sipped from along-stemmed glass and pondered the changes in the Soviet Union,which his family fled in 1920 when he was 2 years old.   He said he is not too optimistic about President Mikhail S.Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika reforms.   ``Twice in Soviet history, we've seen major attempts at reform,one was the New Economic Policy in the 1920s and the other wasKhrushchev's attempt in the 1950s _ both failed,'' he said,referring to the late Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev.   ``I'm still waiting to see real signs of change; I've beenwaiting for over 60 years.''   The year 1992 also marks the 200th anniversary of the finaldemise of the French monarchy following the 1789 revolution. KingLouis XVI was executed in January 1793, along with his Austrianwife, Marie Antoinette.   Modern-day aristocrats, Loewenstein says, must serve as a socialexample because of their educational and economic priveleges.   While German aristocrats make up about 0.8 percent of thecountry's 61 million people, they account for 15 percent oftop-level banking executives and 8 percent to 10 percent of thecountry's politicians, he said.   In Britain, where the royal family and pageantry are part ofnational life, a Sunday Times Magazine study found that of thecountry's 200 richest people were 11 of the 25 dukes, sixmarquesses, 14 earls and nine viscounts. Queen Elizabeth II is byfar the richest with assets worth $8 billion.   In a recent interview, Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, the sixth Dukeof Westminster and reputedly Britain's richest man with about $5billion, said, ``If you are given a lot, I think you should give alot back.''   He added that it was a sense of duty that pushes him to spendone-third of his time supporting some 150 charities.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thurs PMs Sept. 14</NOTE></DOC>
