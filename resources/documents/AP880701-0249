Israeli authorities have blacklisted the songs on grounds theyincite rebellion, but they are distributed secretly in recordedform and are heard widely in Arab east Jerusalem and theIsraeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   The current No. 1 hit, ``Insurrection,'' urges Palestinianchildren to ``rise up with your stones.'' It booms from musicstores and portable radios in east Jerusalem when Israeli police orsoldiers are not around.   In Bethlehem, junior high school students came from classesrecently chanting the refrain of the song ``Intefadeh'' (Arabic foruprising): ``With firebombs and stones, I make my revolution.''   Arab youths also gather around stereos at home and sing along toballads such as ``Palestinian,'' whose lyrics say: ``I fight for myidentity, I fight for freedom, I fight for spring.''   In Jerusalem, police have raided several music stores,confiscated tapes of songs about the uprising and charged storeowners with incitement.   In the occupied territories, troops confiscate tapes of bannedsong if they find any during house searches, but they don't lookspecially for them, said a military official.   ``We act whenever we can, but this is not our first priority. Weare too busy with other things.''   Since the Dec. 8 start of the uprising, dozens of militant,anti-Israeli songs have surfaced in the occupied lands. They rangefrom mournful ballads about the more than 200 Palestinians killedin clashes to stirring anthems glorifying teen-age stonethrowers.   Intefadeh songs are recorded in makeshift studios in Jerusalem,taped from Syrian television or smuggled from Arab countries. Sometapes are sold under the counter in music stores, while others arecopied at home and passed along to friends.   Among the two most popular song collections are ``I Am The Sonof Gaza'' by the Syrian band ``Palestine Roots'' and ``Intefadeh''by Riad Awad, a singer from the West Bank city of Tulkarem.``Palestine Roots'' also sings ``Insurrection,'' while Awad hasrecorded ``Palestinian.''   Awad and others are part of the so-called ``Western wave,'' anew musical style popular among the young. It builds on Arabicmusic traditions, but also uses synthesizers and electricalguitars, placing greater emphasis on rhythm.   Palestinian music store owners say that before the uprising,sentimental love songs were the top sellers.   ``Today, 95 percent of my customers ask for intefadeh ornationalistic songs,'' said an east Jerusalem music store owner.   His store was raided earlier in June after he played``Insurrection'' over loudspeakers. Police confiscated dozens ofintefadeh tapes and charged the owner with incitement. He wasreleased on bail the equivalent to $1,300.   Since the raid, he has restocked his supply, keeping the tapesin two small boxes under the counter. But he no longer playsintefadeh songs loudly, and scrutinizes customers to make sure theyare not undercover police officers.   Distribution of intefadeh songs is often unorthodox. A friend ofthe Jerusalem-born Palestinian singer Mustafa Kurd recently madethe rounds of the music stores, carrying a single copy of Kurd'slatest tape ``The Children of Palestine.''   Shopowners who wanted it made copies in their stores.   At a music store in Jerusalem's walled Old City,``Insurrection'' was booming from loudspeakers one recent day,mingling with the sales pitches of street vendors in thecobblestone street. Riot police patrolled nearby, but took nonotice.   ``I play this because I believe in it,'' said the store owner.``When the cops come, I just change the tape.'' He added that hewas free on bail after being charged with incitement following araid.   Military officials said all songs and written material callingfor violent revolt against the 21-year Israeli occupation areillegal and subject to confiscation.   However, the officials added, military officers have notcompiled a list of banned material because they can't keep up withthe number of intefadeh songs flooding the occupied territories.   But the songs also have their critics in the Palestiniancommunity.   Hussein Barghouti, a literature teacher at the West Bank's BirZeit University, said most have little to do with art.   ``Art is buried in these songs. What remains is sloganism,''said Barghouti who writes songs for a Jerusalem band. ``As a humanbeing, you are touched only on a superficial ideological level.''   He added that the quality of the songs might improve if theywere written by the young activists confronting Israeli soldierswith their stones and slingshots.   ``But the kids are too busy to write songs,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 10</NOTE></DOC>
