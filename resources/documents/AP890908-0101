Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said as the Senate voted 83-8 onThursday to cut its own mass mailing funds by $45 million and devotethe money to drug programs.   It was the first move to funnel money into the war on drugs sincePresident Bush on Tuesday night unveiled his $7.9 billion strategythat relies partly on such transfers to pay the bill.   ``Congress seems to be getting into the swim of things,'' WhiteHouse Chief of Staff John Sununu told reporters traveling with Bushto New Orleans for speeches urging support for his drug program.   He said the Senate ``ought to be complimented'' for approving thecut in mass mailing funds.   The amendment was attached to a $2 billion legislative expensesbill that must be reconciled with a differing House-passed version.   Asked whether the administration would be amenable to Congressvoting more money for the drug war than Bush proposed, Sununu saidthat would be difficult within the boundaries of a budget compromise.   However, he said, ``if they can find an appropriate readjustmentof priorities'' within the budget compromise, ``we're not going tobe closeminded if there are good suggestions that come fromCongress.''   Meanwhile Thursday, national drug policy director William J.Bennett acknowledged under questioning at a Senate JudiciaryCommittee hearing that Bush's drug-fighting blueprint envisionsstate and local governments paying substantial amounts in additionto what would be contributed at the federal level.   Bennett conceded that a 40 percent increase in prison capacitycalled for under the plan could cost the states $5 billion to $10billion, although he said that was the roughest of estimates andsubject to revision. He said the federal government should not playthe role of a ``sugar daddy'' in supplying funds to the states.   ``To succeed, we need the support and involvement of every levelof government and every private citizen,'' Bennett said.   Calls proliferated Thursday for speeded-up approval of theadministration drug bill, which is expected to reach the hopper in aweek or two.   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and House GOP Leader BobMichel, R-Ill., emerged from a White House meeting and urgedextraordinary steps to ``emphasize the sense of urgency needed tobring about congressional action.''   Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph B. Biden Jr., D-Del., called fortalks with the White House to set ground rules that would put thebill ``on, to use Washington jargon, a fast track.''   ``Whether we accept this strategy in total or whether we add tothis strategy, it's all going to have to happen in the next fewweeks,'' Biden said.   However, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, andHouse Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., have not said thus far whetherthey believe action on the bill should be accelerated.   Foley spokesman Jeff Biggs said the issue should be handled ``asexpeditiously as possible.'' Mitchell said through his office thatspeeded-up action was ``under consideration.''   The Bush blueprint would be financed partly by cutting $716million in existing programs. Most of the money already isauthorized for fighting drugs, but about $2 billion would representfresh funds.   Aid to Andean nations in fighting the cocaine cartel,interdiction of drug shipments from South America, tougher treatmentfor offenders and new prisons are part of the plan, along with moreeducation and treatment.   Democrats called for new revenue to finance the drug war whenBush announced his plan Tuesday, but party leaders later said therewas no chance for approval in the face of the president's continuingopposition to a tax increase.   Bennett's initial tour of committees Thursday was smooth for themost part, with Democrats quick to praise the Bush blueprint.   Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J., chairman of the House JudiciaryCommittee's subcommittee on crime, told Bennett the plan was off to``a very, very good start.''   But his warm reception in the Senate was broken when Sen. EdwardM. Kennedy, D-Mass., questioned him about the administration'scontinued refusal to ban American-made assault rifles.   The administration barred import of a number of themilitary-style weapons earlier this year, but it has not movedagainst domestic weapons.   Kennedy said recent seizures in Colombian drug raids show ``halfof the guns that are used locally are being manufactured here in theUnited States of America.''   Bennett said he had received similar reports about the arsenalsof Colombian drug lords. ``It is a matter of concern to us,'' hesaid, but added he would not recommend a ban on the manufacture andproduction and distribution of the weapons in the United States.   Meanwhile, an ABC-Washington Post poll released Thursday saidwide majorities are willing to put up with increased searches ofhomes, cars, school lockers and luggage at the airport to look forillegal drugs.   The poll, conducted by phone Wednesday, asked the opinions of 764adults selected at random. The poll said 88 percent favor moreluggage searches at airports, 87 percent are for searching schoollockers, 87 percent support random police searches of cars and 52percent say police should be able to search homes without a courtorder.   The poll's margin of error is plus or minus four percentagepoints.</TEXT></DOC>
