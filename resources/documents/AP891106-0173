She is on an eight-day visit to Canada and the United States andmade the remark at a meeting with about 70 Filipinos in a Torontohotel before coming to Ottawa.   Mrs. Aquino is to meet Tuesday with Prime Minister BrianMulroney and sign several Canadian-Philippine agreements beforeleaving for the United States.   At the meeting with Philippine expatriates in Toronto's RoyalYork Hotel, she was handed a letter asking her government tonegotiate a settlement with communist rebels and suspendcounterinsurgency operations.   She said her government is committed to protecting human rightsand that she believes a military solution to the revolt, now in its21st year, is not the answer.   ``We have to address the socio-economic needs of our country,which we are doing,'' she said.   Outside the hotel about 25 demonstrators demanded that Mrs.Aquino allow the body of former President Ferdinand Marcos to bereturned to the Philippines for burial.   ``Bring home Marcos!,'' a few demonstrators shouted as Mrs.Aquino left the hotel. She did not respond.   Marcos died in exile in Hawaii on Sept. 28. Mrs. Aquino becamepresident after a popular civilian-military uprising ousted Marcosin February 1986.   It was the first time since Mrs. Aquino began her visit inVancouver Saturday that Marcos loyalists had confronted her.   In Toronto, Mrs. Aquino encouraged investments in thePhilippines, first at a meeting with bankers at the Bank of NovaScotia and later in a speech to the Empire and Canadian clubs.   She said Canadian investment in oil exploration to help thePhilippines secure its energy needs would especially be welcome.</TEXT></DOC>
