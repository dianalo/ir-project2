Iagree, but what if that business deals with customers who arenon-English-speaking?;    When I was a supervisor for a large thrift store inRedwood City, I very quickly learned that I could do my job more efficientlyif I learned some Spanish. Most of my customers were Hispanic, and a greatmany didn't speak or understand English. Some of my co-workers felt that thesepeople should learn English, as they live in the United States, but I knewthat I was going to have to learn at least a few words and phrases if I wantedto communicate with my customers.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TURN LANGUAGE DIFFERENCES INTO AN ASSET  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     Enlisting the help of some Spanish-speaking co-workers, I learned to tellmy customers where they could find certain items, how much the items cost andwhen the store closed. I included a Spanish translation in my storeannouncements of our sales and, after a hard day, really enjoyed saying &quot;Latienda esta cerrada&quot; (The store is closed).;    Since I don't have a talentfor languages, many customers would laugh at my translations, but at leastthey understood me. And I'd like to think my efforts were part of the reason Iearned many raises and was named employee of the month.;    Of course, it'seasy to feel left out when co-workers chat in their native tongue (as Tom Hillrelates); but one shouldn't take it personally if others feel more able toexpress themselves in their first language. Instead of feeling left out whentwo co-workers spoke to each other in Farsi, I sat back in our break room andlistened to the lovely sound of their language.;    We should all rememberthat if there have been but a few small changes in our history, America'sofficial language would be Spanish.
