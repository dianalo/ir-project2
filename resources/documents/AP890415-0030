The proposal came from West Bankers led by Faisal Husseini, headof the Arab Studies Center in East Jerusalem, who met with ForeignMinister Esmat Abdel-Meguid on Sunday, the source said.   The proposals were ``ideas for consideration that do not amountto a cut-and-dried plan,'' the source said on condition ofanonymity.   They were a response to a peace plan proposed by Israeli PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir and unveiled on a trip to Washingtonearlier this month, the source said.   Shamir suggested Israeli-run elections be held in the West Bankand Gaza Strip to choose representatives with whom Israel couldnegotiate Palestinian autonomy.   ``These local Palestinians are the people who are bearing thebrunt of the occupation. They are trying to help with ideas,instead of rejecting things out of hand,'' the source said.   PLO officials, who turned down the Shamir plan, indicated theyopposed the West Bankers' approach.   Saeed Kamal, Cairo representative of the Palestine LiberationOrganization, denied that local Palestinians had offered anyproposals.   ``This is a big lie,'' Kamal told The Associated Press.   ``These so-called proposals are only ideas floated by Westerndiplomats in Jerusalem. As far as the PLO is concerned, anyproposal involving elections can be made only in the U.S.-PLOdialogue in Tunis,'' he said.   Those talks began in the Tunisian capital in December after PLOleader Yasser Arafat recognized Israel's right to exist, renouncedterrorism and accepted key U.N. resolutions on a Middle Eastsettlement.   The Egyptian source said the West Bankers suggested a four-phaseplan.   First, an international force would oversee withdrawal ofIsraeli troops from populated areas in the occupied territories tofringe positions.   Polling then would be held under international supervision toelect a parliament-in-exile. A delegation would be chosen fromamong the parliament's members to negotiate interim self-rule withthe Israelis.   In the final stage, the source said, the PLO and Israel wouldnegotiate autonomy for occupied territories at an internationalconference.   The PLO, however, demands that all Israeli forces leave the WestBank and Gaza as a precursor to internationally-supervisedelections.   At a meeting with President Bush last week, Shamir proposed hisplan for Israeli-overseen elections to choose Palestinians tonegotiate autonomy for the occupied territories.   The Egyptian source said the Cairo government views the WestBankers' ideas ``with an open mind. We have not taken any positionyet.''   Since the uprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bankand Gaza began in December 1987, more than 425 Palestinians and 18Israelis have died.</TEXT></DOC>
