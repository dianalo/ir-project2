Despite the recent flood of money into stocks and stockmutual funds, individuals still have only about a fifth oftheir financial assets in the stock market, down from 45% inthe late 1960s, according to David L. Babson andamp; Co., aCambridge, Mass., investment adviser.</LP><TEXT>   Many financial experts contend that investors should betaking far more risk with their money, by owning more stocks.But they don't base that view on the stock market's near-termoutlook.   &quot;We think it's quite a risky time right now,&quot; says RobertBingham, a partner with Bingham, Osborn andamp; Scarborough, a SanFrancisco investment adviser. &quot;We're close to an all-timehigh in the U.S. stock market. But you've got to have someparticipation in the equity markets.&quot;   The case for investing in stocks is based not on themarket's short-term prospects, but on the superior returnsthat investors are likely to earn if they hold stocks forfive years or longer. &quot;Individuals take too little risk,&quot;argues H. Bradlee Perry, chairman of David L. Babson andamp; Co.&quot;In the short run, stocks are risky. But in the long runthey're not. In the long run, the trend is upwards.&quot;   Why are Americans so timid with their investmentportfolios? Blame it on a skewed idea of what risk really is.If you think risk is the chance that your portfolio mighttemporarily lose 15% or 20% of its value, then stocks areundoubtedly risky.   Since 1926, there have been 20 calendar years when theStandard andamp; Poor's 500 stock index has posted a loss,according to Chicago's Ibbotson Associates. The worst year ofall, 1931, saw the Sandamp;P 500 plunge 43.3%.   But before you call your broker and dump all yourstockholdings, consider some other Ibbotson data. Since 1926,the first year for which Ibbotson has figures, long-termgovernment bonds have had a total return -- bond-pricechanges plus interest payments -- of 4.8% a year, andTreasury bills have gained 3.7% annually.   Those gains are barely ahead of inflation, which rose 3.1%a year during the same period. Figure in taxes, and investingyour money with the government starts to look like legalizedextortion. And what about stocks? They handily outpacedinflation and the tax man -- with a pretax total return,which includes reinvested dividends, of 10.4% a year since1926.   Past returns don't guarantee future results, of course,but the historical data are compelling. &quot;If you have a15-year holding period, you can argue that a bond portfoliois much more risky {than stocks} because of inflation,&quot; saysMr. Bingham. &quot;You can't ride along with 70% or 80% in bonds.Bonds are there just to provide a cushion in a portfolio.&quot;   How much should investors have in stocks? A lot depends onhow much risk an investor can tolerate, but many investmentadvisers say the more people put into stocks, the better.Russell Hill, a senior vice president with Chicago'sStratford Advisory Group, even suggests that folks who are 10or more years from retirement should consider putting theirentire investment portfolio into stocks.   And Mr. Hill says retirees shouldn't let the stock portionof their portfolio drop below 50%. &quot;People should be muchmore heavily invested in stocks than they are,&quot; he argues.   Investing heavily in the stock market can benerve-wracking for even the most seasoned investor. And afterthe sharp runup of the past 16 months, a market setbackwouldn't be surprising. But experts say that investors havetwo weapons they can use to make the stock market's gyrationsmore bearable. One is diversification, and the other is time.   Diversification is a sort of modern alchemy. If you takehighly risky securities and mix them together, you often endup with a portfolio that still generates decent returns, butthe portfolio's value doesn't bounce around nearly as much asthe price of the portfolio's parts.   How does it work? Stocks don't all move up and down intandem. One stock's price decline will often be offset byanother's rise, leaving the overall portfolio value prettymuch undisturbed. For small investors, the best way toachieve diversification is to buy stock mutual funds. A stockfund typically owns 30 to 300 stocks; many funds will acceptinvestments as low as $1,000.   But owning just one fund isn't enough. Every stock fundhas a distinctive investment style, and these styles can goin and out of favor. For the past three years, for instance,funds that buy foreign stocks have been lousy performers,while most U.S. stock funds have posted decent gains.   Because it is impossible to say for sure which of thesetwo investment styles will sparkle or for how long, investorsshould own both international funds and U.S. stock funds,argues Mr. Bingham, the San Francisco investment adviser.Similarly, Mr. Bingham says it is wise to own both &quot;growth&quot;funds, which invest in companies with rapid earnings growth,and &quot;value&quot; funds, which buy stocks that are cheap relativeto assets or current earnings. Furthermore, he says,investors should funnel part of their money into fundsspecializing in large companies with stock market valuesabove $1 billion, and part into smaller companies.   A well-diversified stock fund portfolio should probablyinclude funds that invest in all of these different areas.Which particular funds should you use?   Mr. Bingham suggests buying six funds for the stockportion of your portfolio. He advises splitting 40% of yourportfolio between two small-stock funds, Vanguard ExplorerFund and Pennsylvania Mutual Fund. With another 40% of theportfolio, he would buy equal amounts of two largecompanystock funds, Neuberger andamp; Berman Guardian Fund and VanguardIndex Trust-500 Portfolio, an index fund that seeks toreplicate the performance of the Sandamp;P 500. For the final 20%,Mr. Bingham suggests dividing your money between twointernational stock funds, T. Rowe Price International StockFund and Scudder International Fund.   &quot;If you bought this kind of mix, and held it, you couldn'tgo very far wrong,&quot; argues Mr. Bingham. He also adviseskeeping at least a small portion of a portfolio in bonds, toprovide a cushion in market downdrafts.   Putting together a well-diversified portfolio of stockmutual funds will certainly help to make owning stocks morebearable because at any one time there will usually be atleast one part of your portfolio that is doing well. But forpeople who are heavily invested in stocks, there is reallyonly one cure for the stock market's volatility, and that istime.   There may have been 20 down years for the stock marketsince 1926, but the statistics are a lot more appealing ifyou look at longer time periods. The Ibbotson data, forinstance, can be sliced up into 62 rolling five-year periods,beginning with the five years through December 1930,proceeding next to the five years through 1931, and so on,finishing up with the five years through December 1991. Outof these 62 five-year periods, there have been only sevenoccasions when stocks have posted a loss.   But even these statistics may overstate the risk involvedin stock market investing. For starters, only two of thoseseven losing streaks occurred in the post-World War IIperiod. In addition, such statistics are based on theassumption that you unwisely throw all you money into thestock market in one great wad.   Imagine that you instead take a more prudent course anduse a stock-market entry technique known as dollar-costaveraging. This involves putting equal amounts into the stockmarket at regular intervals, such as every month or everythree months, so that you buy fewer shares when the market isup but more shares when the market is down.   If you put equal amounts into the stock market at thestart of every year beginning in 1946, the only five-yearstretch when you would have lost money would have been in thefive years through December 1974, according to San Franciscoinvestment adviser Litman/Gregory andamp; Co. And even for theseinvestors, salvation wasn't too far off. Because the stockmarket rebounded 37.2% in 1975, those who toughed it out for12 more months would have recouped all of their losses, andthen some.   For people with a large chunk of money to invest instocks, Litman/Gregory's Kenneth Gregory suggests moving themoney into the market over the next 12 to 18 months, in equalmonthly installments. &quot;If the market dropped 10%, I'dprobably double up on the amount I was investing each month,&quot;says Mr. Gregory.   Ben Clinton, a 26-year-old ChemLawn Corp. employee fromFrederick, Md., says he is about to venture into the stockmarket for the first time by buying a stock mutual fund.   &quot;You don't get anywhere by putting your money in a bankaccount because you don't make any money that way,&quot; says Mr.Clinton. &quot;I know the returns on mutual funds are a lothigher. Of course, I know mutual funds are a lot more riskyalso. I just want to get something going so I have some moneydown the line.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
