The lower house had approved the measure on Aug. 27.    The revision of the foreign-exchange and trade-control law increases the maximum prison term for export violations to five years from three and raises to three years from one the period in which the government can ban violators from selling their products to communist nations. The revised law also allows for closer consultations between the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Foreign Ministry over the regulation of exports.    Approval of the legislation followed the disclosure earlier this year that a unit of Toshiba Corp. had illegally sold sophisticated milling machines to the Soviet Union. The revelation angered U.S. officials, who said the equipment helped the Soviets make their submarines quieter and harder to detect.    The sales violated both Japanese law and rules of the Paris-based Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, which regulates exports to communist countries.    Japan's minister of international trade and industry, Hajime Tamura, is in Washington this week to meet with American officials in an effort to ease trade tensions with the U.S. He will report on the revised law to the officials. </TEXT></DOC>
