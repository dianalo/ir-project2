They prove a local chemical composition andatomic structure of YBa/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 7/ rhombic phase. Profilebroadening and satellites of X-ray diffraction reflections independentlyprove the presence of these regions in monocrystals. Two systems of unidimensionalchains -01-Cu1-01- and 90 deg straight -Cu1-Cu1-Cu1- take place withinthese regions. In the latter systems every Cu1 atom in the perpendicularto chain plane is surrounded(isolated) in the square by four oxygen atoms.The existence of these unidimensional chains is the main structural detailfor high-temperature superconductivity.</TEXT></DOC>
