(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>CASUAL DB2 DISCOURSE STILL AN ELUSIVE QUESTandM;When the relational model first gained popularity in the early '80s, itsproponents emphasized its ease of use.andP;  In particular, Structured QueryLanguage (SQL) was extolled as an &quot;English-like&quot; query language that grantedend users easy access to data.andP;  Vendors of SQL-based systems would show how ashort SQL statement could answer such tough data processing queries as, &quot;Showme all the employees who earn more than their manager.&quot;andM;Certainly, compared to Cobol and sequential files or IMS databases, the SQLrequired to solve this problem is short, but is it easy?andP;  Can a databaseadministrator reasonably expect a non-programmer to produce complex SQL withminimal training?andM;SQL FLAWS, VIRTUESandM;Experience showed that the answer was clearly no.andP;  The pendulum swung frompraising SQL's virtues to soundly condemning it as a terrible language.andP;  E.F.andO;Codd, author of the relational database model, even wrote articles, &quot;FatalFlows in SQL&quot;--parts one and two--published in CMG Transactions, spring 1989.andM;In fact, SQL is neither as good as its early supporters bragged nor as bad asits detractors have characterized it.andP;  Although it is not suitable for thecasual user, a non-programmer who is comfortable with computers and whowrites reasonably complex spreadsheet macros on a micro (some might considerthis person to be a closet programmer) can learn to solve fairly complexproblems in SQL.andM;It remains true, however, that most end users who want casual access to thedatabase require a query language that provides interactive access to thedatabase, and online presentation of results.andM;Andrew Filipowski, president of Platinum Systems in Lombard, Ill., whichspecializes in supplying DB2 tools, points out that DB2 raised the importanceof this issue when IBM originally sold it as a query-intensive informationcenter product.andM;BIG BLUE AND DB2andM;Most query languages interface to DB2 through SQL.andP;  But they differ in howthey generate the SQL, the types of things they will do with the returneddata, other DBMSs to which they interface, and the computing environmentrequired to run them.andP;  Many products blur the distinction between reportwriters and query languages by significantly enhancing the query language'sability to format reports.andM;Query Management Facility (QMF) is IBM's main vehicle for interactive accessof DB2.andP;  It is an essential part of IBM's positioning of DB2 as aninformation center product as well as a production system product.andM;Peter Claypool, an advisory product planner for QMF, reports that QMF iswidely used in DB2 installations.andP;  An IBM questionnaire (based on a smallsample of users) showed that it was heavily used in financial applicationsand human resources applications, as well as by programmers and databaseadministrators as a development tool.andM;Users access DB2 through either interactive SQL or Query-By-Example (QBE).andO;IBM added a prompting facility to better address the needs of novice users.andO;IBM intends for it to have the same functionality as prompted access in theQuery Manager component of OS/2 Extended Edition.andM;Since QMF runs on a mainframe using 3270-type devices, and Query Manager runson a PC using the Presentation Manager graphical user interface, users willinteract with the two products in significantly different ways.andM;However, both products use menus and prompts to create SQL statements.andP;  Theycan read the system catalog tables and prompt users for column names.andO;Because they aim at novice users, they cannot be used to construct complexSQL statements such as those requiring subselects.andM;Query-By-Example is an approach developed by Moishe Zloof of IBM in the1970s.andP;  Users fill in the blanks on forms corresponding to the columns of adatabase table.andP;  These skeleton forms are automatically created by QMF.andP;  Atable with many columns will generate a skeleton that extends off the screen,although the user can horizontally scroll the form.andP;  Complex queries aredifficult to express and so QBE is rarely used for them.andM;At one time IBM offered a product for the VM operating system called QBE,which was an entire DBMS based on Query-By-Example.andP;  Many users in the UnitedStates got their start with that version and stayed with QBE when theymigrated to DB2 or SQL/DS.andP;  QBE is also more popular in non-English speakingcountries where its use of column names in forms emphasizes the locallanguage.andM;Queries from interactive SQL or QBE can be saved and run repeatedly.andP;  Theuser can specify parameters that will result in selecting different data.andO;This capability is important in many installations where the databaseadministrators are reluctant to allow end users free access to the data.andP;  Itis easy to create a request that will command excessive machine resources.andM;Data retrieved from QBE or SQL queries can be formatted using the QMF reportwriter.andP;  The interface to the report writer consists of a series of screensin which the user specifies the output format.andP;  Basic formats include acolumn structure with up to six levels of subtotals (or control breaks).andO;Cross-tabs can be specified, as can functions for calculating percentages ofvarious totals.andM;Many installations buy other products to supplement QMF or in some cases toreplace it.andP;  Because QMF only runs under the Time Sharing Option (TSO) ofIBM's MVS operating system, and because a large number of interactive TSOusers is a big load to handle, many organizations opt for a product that runsunder CICS.andM;NATURAL LANGUAGE USEandM;A second reason is that QMF is limited to accessing DB2 and SQL/DS databases.andO;Organizations that have data stored in Vsam files or other DBMSs want to givetheir users a common tool to access data wherever it is stored.andM;Intellect, from AICorp in Waltham, Mass., is a query tool that through theuse of natural language makes accessing the database easier than using SQL.andO;In addition to its DB2 interface, Intellect works with a wide variety ofDBMSs and file structures, including SQL/DS, IMS and Vsam.andP;  It also workswith CICS and TSO.andP;  Other functions include report formatting and the abilityto download retrieved data to a PC.andM;An interesting extension is the integration of KBMS, AICorp's expert systemapplication development tool.andP;  It lets users define complex rule-basedretrievals that work just like the natural language access.andM;A lexicon, or dictionary of words, is initially set up by importinginformation from the DB2 system catalog tables.andP;  It is then expanded toinclude the meaning of terms commonly used in the application.andP;  Intellectuses the lexicon as a basis for translating queries into SQL, which are thenprocessed by DB2.andP;  The privileges established in DB2 protect the databasefrom unauthorized access.andM;Intellect adds a relatively small overhead to sQL, and it takes fulladvantage of DB2's ability to optimize SQL.andP;  DB2 performs all joins, summarycalculations, grouping, and conditions on rows and groups similar touser-generated SQL.andM;MINIMIZING PROBLEMSandM;Although it is easy to make a query that looks simple but generates complexSQL, there are controls in both Intellect and DB2 that help avoid thisproblem.andP;  Intellect will also do some post-processing of result sets thatgive it capabilities beyond SQL.andP;  For example, it can calculate statisticssuch as a percent of a total.andM;As in English, a user can easily ask a question that is ambiguous or subjectto misinterpretation.andP;  As Kelsey Thomas, product manager for Intellect, says,&quot;The telepathy interface isn't done yet.&quot;andM;She points out that to minimize the problem, Intellect uses context to removeambiguities or where necessary, enter into the dialogue.andP;  A feedbackmechanism echoes the query either in an Intellect syntax or SQL.andP;  This helpsensure that the system has interpreted the query in the way it was intended.andM;Joan Dixon, an information technology consultant at Mutual Benefit LifeInsurance of Newark, N.J., is the company's system administrator forIntellect.andP;  Mutual Benefit selected Intellect in 1983 to provide users witheasy access to data.andM;They now have over 250 active Intellect users on an Amdahl 5990 working with38 applications, including human resources and asset querying.andP;  Users includethe company president, non-technical managers and programmers.andM;The lexicon is initialized from the DB2 catalog and data tables usingIntellect's tools, and a supervised user test is conducted to learn whatother terms must be included.andP;  After about two weeks the system is ready forgeneral use.andM;For each application, system administrators write a guide to introduce usersto Intellect.andP;  One point support people want to make sure users understand isthat no matter what it looks like, Intellect doesn't know the data or theapplication.andP;  If there is incorrect data, Intellect will still use it.andM;Feridoon Khosravi is manager of knowledge-based systems support at SouthernCalifornia Edison in Rosemead, Calif.andP;  Edison's non-technical staff usesIntellect to access DB2; more technical people use QMF.andP;  The databasesqueried include information on customers, employees and health care.andO;Building a lexicon that accurately reflects the vocabulary used is essentialto success, so each customer organization has a lexicon administrator whoworks with the client to define the application lexicon.andP;  Only lexiconadministrators can update the lexicon.andM;The company is quite happy with Intellect, according to Khosravi.andO;Performance is fine, except in those cases where many tables need to bejoined to respond to a query.andP;  This, however, is not an Intellect problem,but rather a consequence of normalization in database dosign.andP;  The samedifficulty would arise in using SQL directly.andM;Information Builders, New York, offers Table Talk as a pick-and-choose queryand report writer, as well as its more comprehensive Focus language forreporting and statistical analysis.andP;  Because of its long history of workingwith a wide variety of DBMSs on different platforms using variouscommunications monitors, Focus is one of the most widely used front ends forDB2.andM;Two complementary products for DB2 are available from the Dylakor Division ofSterling Software, Chatsworth Calif.andP;  DYL-280 II Relational is acomprehensive report writer primarily used in batch, while DYL-IQ Express isused for interactive query.andM;Carole Morton, president of Dylakor, says the DYL products' ability tointerface to a wide variety of DBMSs is important to their users.andP;  The userinterface to DYL-QI Express is either a series of fill-in-the-blank screensor a command-level syntax for more experienced users.andM;Later this year, the command level will allow native SQL to be passed to DB2.andM;The Platinum Report Facility (PRF) from Platinum Technology uses a series ofscreens to prompt for information that is used to build an SQL statement.andO;Data retrieved from a PRF query is formatted into a report.andP;  Unlike QMF, PRFwill retrieve all the data before displaying any of it.andM;In QMF, the goal is to minimize the time between the completion of the queryentry and the first display of data.andM;Consequently, each succeeding page of data displayed requires access to thedatabase.andP;  This requires more time as well as keeping the rows in the querylocked.andP;  Platinum chose to minimize the time data was locked for lessinterference with production applications and quicker display of subsequentscreens of data.andM;Jim Woodworth, database administrator for Washington Water Power in Spokane,Wash., says the utility chose PRF for interactive querying because it runsunder CICS.andP;  They also use DYL-280 II Relational to extract data from Vsamand load it into DB2, as well as for reporting from DB2.andP;  Their majorapplication is a customer information system that consists of over 8,000cylinders on a 3380, so they worry about queries consuming too much machineresource.andP;  To avoid this problem, they use the resource limiter, which theyset by monitoring usage.andM;Bob Wall, data resource manager at Rite-Aid in Harrisburg, Penn., says thatPRF running under CICS was also an important factor in their decision.andP;  AtRite-Aid, the MIS staff responds to user requests, and creates canned PRFqueries and reports that can be run with different parameters.andP;  The users runthese in batch.andM;SAS Institute of Cary, N.C., provides the SAS/DB2 statistical reporting andgraphic tool for use with DB2.andM;PC/SQL/link from Micro Decisionware of Boulder, Colo., has a history ofsuccess as a cooperative processing query language for DB2 and other DBMSs.andO;PC/SQL-link uses a series of menus to create an SQL request, which is thenshipped to the mainframe where a program uses the SQL to retrieve the datafrom DB2, and then ships it back to the PC.andP;  It can put data into a varietyof PC packages such as Lotus 1-2-3 or Ashton-Tate's dBase.andM;COOPERATIVE PROCESSINGandM;A useful aspect of PC/SQL-link is its ability to address the issue of workingwith existing networks and PCs.andP;  PC/SQL/link will run in either a charactermode under MS-DOS or in an SAA-compliant mode under Microsoft Windows.andP;  Evenmore important, however, is the fact that it can be used with DB2 on eitherexisting 3270 networks with a 3270 emulation board, or through a variety oflocal area networks.andM;Most mainframe query language users expressed a strong interest in queryingtheir DB2 database from a PC, and the mainframe vendors are well aware thatcooperative processing is a burgeoning requirement.andP;  AICorp has alreadyannounced a product to be released later in 1990, and most other vendors areworking toward meeting the requirement.andM;Query languages for DB2 are constantly improving, and the future will seethem advancing in both ease of use and functionality.andP;  As cooperativeprocessing becomes more prevalent, display and reporting functions willmigrate to the PC, where they can take advantage of the local processingpower, freeing the mainframe to manipulate the database.andP;  This will alsoresult in much greater penetration of query languages, as they bring the datato where the user is--on the PC.andM;Edelstein is a principla of Euclid Associates, Berkeley, Calif., a firm whichdoes consulting work for both vendors and users.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
