Brazil in 1975 launched its Pro-Alcohol program and createdmillions of alcohol-powered cars in the world's first large-scaletest of the fuel.   The leaders of this oil-importing country believed the programcould mean not just greater energy independence but also bigsavings. Alcohol is made from sugar cane, of which Brazil is aleading producer.   Today, however, the government is urging a return toold-fashioned, polluting, gasoline engines.   Burdened with a huge foreign debt and 1,000 percent inflation,Brazil says it simply cannot afford to subsidize the $40-a-barrelfuel.   ``Pro-Alcohol is ... inflationary and consumes as much energy asit produces,'' said Joao Augusto Gurgel, a longtime critic and theowner of the Gurgel auto plant.   In announcing measures to combat air pollution, Bush on Mondayoffered incentives to the U.S. auto industry to build cars that runon cleaner-burning fuels such as alcohol and natural gas.   When Brazil's alcohol program started, alcohol was simply mixedwith gasoline at 22 percent to make gasohol.   In 1979, the program got more ambitious. The first 2,271pure-alcohol cars were produced. To compensate for poor mileage, thegovernment made alcohol 35 percent cheaper than gasoline and offeredtax breaks on the new cars.   The incentives worked. Sales of alcohol cars shot up from 0.3percent of total sales in 1979 to 28.5 percent the next year.   By 1985, alcohol cars accounted for 96 percent of all autos sold.Today, 3.7 million of Brazil's 12.9 million vehicles run on purealcohol.   The alcohol industry grew with it. Distilleries today produce 3.2billion gallons of alcohol a year, five times more than a decade ago.   One of the benefits was less air pollution. Alcohol cars producehalf the carbon monoxide of gasoline-powered ones and no harmfulhydrocarbons.   But Petrobras, the government oil monopoly, said it has spent$649 million on alcohol subsidies since 1981.   Worse, when it raised alcohol prices, the government had to raisegasoline prices too to keep the 35 percent spread. Themerry-go-round of price increases added to inflation.   Also, offshore oil fields were discovered in Brazil that made thecountry less dependent on imports. Brazil now produces about 600,000barrels a day, or about 55 percent of its oil needs.   In May, world sugar prices rose, and many Brazilian cane growerssold their harvests for sugar instead of alcohol. Service stationsin some cities simply ran out of the fuel.   ``It was like we were on the Titanic approaching an iceberg, butnobody believed it would hit _ and it did,'' said PetrobrasPresident Carlos Sant'Anna.   The government immediately reduced the amount of alcohol ingasohol to 18 percent and urged automakers to cut the number ofpure-alcohol cars produced to 50 percent of the total.   Sales of alcohol cars slumped last month and owners of suchvehicles have lined up at mechanics to convert to gasoline.   ``It was a shock for the market. Consumers felt cheated,'' saidMarcelo Bairao, spokesman for the Syndicate of Car Dealers andDistributors in Sao Paulo state.   The move back to gasoline will worsen air pollution in bigcities, environmentalists warn.   ``The quality of air has improved. Now we're breathing better airbecause there is less carbon monoxide, which is the principalpollutant,'' said Alfred Szwarc, manager of the Vehicle PollutionControl Department of Cetesb, Sao Paulo's environmental protectionagency.   Szwarc said that despite other sources of pollution, such as thewidespread burning of the Amazon rain forest, the Pro-Alcoholprogram has improved the air primarily in urban centers.   Still, Brazil doesn't plan to abandon the alcohol program. And ithas its defenders.   ``Just because we don't need it now, doesn't mean we should killit,'' said Luiz Avelar Scheuer, director of the local subsidiary ofMercedez Benz. ``When a baby stops drinking milk, you don't get ridof the cow. You could need butter later.''</TEXT></DOC>
