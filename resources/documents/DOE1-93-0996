Features of the system and the network structure tomeet the future requirements for feature expansion are described suchas allocation of optimum function to each terminal station in the system,customer service, etc. A system structure with a high speed informationoptical fiber system as its nucleus is proposed for the total automaticdistribution system. Functions of the business office, substation, andcustomer service terminals are summarized. Explanation was made alsoabout the total network structure including all the terminals.
