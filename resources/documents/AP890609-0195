Sandinista army sources in Jinotega, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said the attacks on the CentroAmerica and Canal plantsoccurred simultaneously at 9:30 p.m. Thursday about 100 miles northof the capital.   Early reports had mentioned only CentroAmerica as a target.   ``There were no deaths on either side,'' Col. Manuel Salvatierratold The Associated Press on Friday. Salvatierra is military chiefof the 6th Region, which oversees Jinotega and Matagalpa provinces.   Sources said the rebels, known as the Contras, also blew upelectrical poles along the road between Jinotega and CentroAmerica.The 50-megawatt plant is a major component of the nation's powergrid.   The government's Voice of Nicaragua radio station said Jinotegacity, the provincial capital, and a large part of northern Nicaraguawere left without electricity all night. Power was restored in someareas early Friday, it said.   Sandinsta soldier Ladislao Vargas, among those trying to repelthe rebel attack at the Canal plant, said one soldier was slightlyinjured.   ``They couldn't get us out of the ditch,'' said Vargas, motioningto ditches surrounded by stones.   ``We communicated by radio, but reinforcements arrived after theContras had begun retreating.''   Vargas said the fighting between about 25 rebels and six soldiersat the Canal plant lasted about 30 minutes.   During the attack, the minister of the Nicaraguan EnergyInstitute, Emilio Rapacciolli, ordered plant operators to turn offturbines to minimize damage.   Energy officials reported minor damage to the Canal plantbuilding, but said the turbines were not affected.   Rapacciolli said serious damage to Canal could have causedmassive flooding in the neighboring Cacio Valley, home to about 400people.   The plant controls all water flow into CentroAmerica's turbines.   Salvatierra said the attack on CentroAmerica by about 100 Contrascame at two points and lasted up to 45 minutes.   Voice of Nicaragua called the attack a violation of cease-fireaccords accepted last year by the U.S.-backed rebels and government.   That agreement included a temporary cease-fire and called fornegotiations to end the 9-year-old civil war. Talks on a permanenttruce collapsed last September. The government said it wouldcontinue to observe a cease-fire, but both sides have madeoccasional attacks.   President Daniel Ortega extended the cease-fire on May 31 for 30days.   He said 559 civilians and soldiers were killed or wounded in 881attacks between Jan. 1 to May 29. He said the army killed 355 rebelsand wounded 283 during that period.</TEXT></DOC>
