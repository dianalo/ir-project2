Partial operating profit consists of net interest and fee earnings less spending on personnel and equipment. Dresder, West Germany's second-largest commercial bank, didn't disclose full operating profit, which includes trading for the bank's own account.    Dresdner said the current beneficial economic climate has had a positive effect on the bank's business. The bank last week predicted a surprisingly high 3% rate of growth for the German economy this year. </TEXT></DOC>
