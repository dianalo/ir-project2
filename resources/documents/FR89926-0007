That action was prompted by a report of the loss of nosegear steering. This amendment requires retorquing of the steering cuffring nut, repetitive inspections for security and lockwire integrity atrevised intervals, and installation of a modification which terminatesthe need for the repetitive inspections. This amendment is prompted byfurther investigation which revealed that loss of the ring nut torque canoccur whether or not the lockwire is intact. This condition, if not corrected,could result in loss of control of the airplane on the ground.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>October 30, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>The applicable service information may be obtainedfrom British Aerospace PLC, Librarian for Service Bulletins, P.O.

Mailing address: FAA, Northwest MountainRegion, 17900 Pacific Highway South, C-68966, Seattle, Washington 98168.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>A proposal to amend Part 39 of theFederal Aviation Regulations by superseding AD 88-22-05, Amendment 39-6047(53 FR 41152; October 20, 1988), applicable to British Aerospace ModelBAe 146 series airplanes, to require retorquing of the steering cuff ringnut, repetitive inspections for security and lockwire integrity at revisedintervals, and installation of a modification which terminates the needfor the repetitive inspections, was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 7, 1989 (54 FR 24354). Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate inthe making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the singlecomment received. The commenter supported the rule, but requested that the compliance timefor the terminating action be changed from 2,500 to 2,800 landings afterthe effective date of the amendment. This compliance period would allowthe operator to accomplish the modification during its normal heavy maintenanceschedule. The FAA concurs and has determined that the compliance time maybe increased by 300 additional landings without adversely affecting safety.Paragraph B. of the final rule has been revised accordingly. The economic impact analysis paragraph, below, has been revised to indicatethat 2 manhours are necessary to accomplish the required actions; the NPRMhad incorrectly shown this number as ``one-half'' manhour. However, thetotal cost impact reflected in the NPRM was correctly specified as $3,600,as shown below. After careful review of the available data, including the comment notedabove, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest requirethe adoption of the rule with the change previously noted. The FAA hasdetermined that this change will neither increase the scope of the AD,nor impose an additional economic burden on any operator. It is estimated that 45 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected bythis AD, that it will take approximately 2 manhours per airplane to accomplishthe required actions, and that the average labor cost will be $40 per manhour.The parts will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost. Based on thesefigures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimatedto be $3,600. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is nota ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positiveor negative, on a substantial number of small entities, under the criteriaof the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been preparedfor this action and is contained in the regulatory docket. A copy of itmay be obtained from the Rules Docket. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 </ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal AviationRegulations as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
