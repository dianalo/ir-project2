(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About 40 peace activists carrying bannersand beating drums began a 200-mile march Sunday to protest the useof nuclear power in the U.S. space program and by the military.   The three-week march began at Cape Canaveral, where the Navy'snuclear-armed Trident 2 missile system is tested, and will takedemonstrators to Kings Bay, Ga., where the missiles are to bedeployed aboard submarines.   Members of the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice plan tojoin hundreds of other activists in a rally Oct. 8 outside the gatesof the Georgia submarine base.   Coalition spokesman Bruce Gagnon said the activists will average10 miles per day, stopping to distribute literature along the way.   They are protesting both the Navy's Trident 2 program and NASA'splans to launch a nuclear-powered spacecraft aboard the next spaceshuttle.   The spacecraft Galileo, waiting to be dispatched from Atlantis ona six-year voyage to Jupiter, will get its power from two nucleargenerators containing 48 pounds of radioactive plutonium-238.   The coalition has threatened to seek a court order and totrespass on the launch pad if necessary to stop the flight, now setfor Oct. 12.   NASA has released details of tests conducted on Galileo's radioisotope thermoelectric generators. But the protest group isskeptical of space agency claims that there is virtually no chanceof an explosion that would destroy the nuclear canisters and releaselife-threatening radioactive fallout.</TEXT></DOC>
