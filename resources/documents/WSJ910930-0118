Think about it. Every car, videocassette recorder, boombox or stereo imported into the U.S. from Japan has operatingand assembly instructions. And every dealer and repair shopgets parts catalogs and repair guides. In almost everyinstance, the translations have been done in Japan -- a factoften obvious upon reading them. The Japanese have been slowto realize that it would be in everyone's best interest tohave the translations done in the U.S.</LP><TEXT>   What are the advantages of American translations? For one,the translated material is usually easier to read. &quot;This canfor be attached only when operating . . .&quot; or equally poor&quot;Japlish&quot; translations are all too common. There simply arenot enough good English speakers in Japan. A cardinal rule inlanguage translation is to use native speakers to translateinto the target language. This rarely happens in Japan.   Furthermore, American translations from Japanese toEnglish are economically competitive. The most moderntranslation technology, including translation done bycomputers, is found in the U.S. At the recent World MachineTranslation Conference held in Washington, many of the topJapanese linguists were present. They came to see what theU.S. had to offer.   Of course, machine translation doesn't always work. If,for example, assembly instructions read: &quot;inspect for wearand damage,&quot; a machine may read that you must inspect forwear and then damage the product. In cases where directmachine translation is not appropriate, U.S. translators arecompetitive with their Japanese counterparts due to theiraccess to technologically advanced software and their betterknowledge of English.   Considering these compelling reasons, why aren't theJapanese sending more of their translations to the U.S.? Forone thing, Japanese who study English in Japan actuallybelieve they speak good English. Traveling in Japan, onesometimes sees people wearing big buttons that say &quot;I speakEnglish&quot; -- but when you talk to them they do not understanda word you say. There are not enough foreigners around tocontest the translators' presumed English proficiency, so thedirectors of Japanese translation departments think theirtranslations are good.   But the main reason is simple inertia. Things have alwaysbeen done this way, so why change now?   What is surprising about this attitude is that gettingmore Japanese-to-English translations done in the U.S. wouldbe a win-win situation. The manuals and other documents wouldbe far more readablewhich, in turn, makes the products easierto use and to sell. And the advantages to the U.S. of doingmore translation business are obvious.   Translation services are a minor item in U.S.-Japan traderelations, but a symbolically important one. As one U.S.trade official told me: &quot;The Japanese are shooting themselvesin the foot with their position. The more opportunities wegive in this country to translate, the better understandingwe will have of the Japanese.&quot;   ---   Mr. Freivalds is vice president of sales and marketing atCorporate Word, a Pittsburgh-based technical translationfirm.</TEXT></DOC>
