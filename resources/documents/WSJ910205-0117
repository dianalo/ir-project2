One by one, since last October, strategists at seven of 10large brokerage houses have concluded that investors shouldincrease their exposure to stocks.</LP><TEXT>   Back in October, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitits 1990 low of 2365.10, the 10 firms' average recommendationcalled for investors to keep 13.6% of their investmentportfolios in cash reserves. Today, the typical advice isonly 7% in cash reserves, compared with about 55% in stocksand 36% in bonds.   A skeptic might say that the strategists are just climbingon the bandwagon, now that the Dow Jones industrials haverisen some 400 points from the low.   But many strategists say something fundamental haschanged: The Federal Reserve System has committed itself tofighting the recession with lower interest rates. And one ofWall Street's oldest adages is, &quot;Don't fight the Fed.&quot;   Lower interest rates &quot;have ultimately fueled bullmarkets,&quot; says Edward Kerschner, strategist at PaineWebberInc., the firm with the best asset-allocation advice in 1990among the 10 firms in a continuing study. He is suggestingthat investors put about 59% of their money in stocks.   Asset allocation is the art of dividing investment moneyamong such categories as stocks, bonds, and &quot;cash&quot; -- meaningsafe, short-term investments like Treasury bills. The study,conducted quarterly by this newspaper and Wilshire Associatesof Santa Monica, Calif., evaluates how individual investorswould fare by following the 10 brokerage houses' advice.   Mr. Kerschner was cautious on stocks early in 1990, andbecame more bullish as the year went on. People who followedhis advice gained 5% last year, the study estimates. Bycontrast, stocks (with dividends included) declined 3.2%, anda &quot;benchmark blend&quot; of 55% stocks, 35% bonds and 10% cashgained 2.1%.   Currently, Mr. Kerschner thinks the risk in stocks islimited to a loss of 5% to 10%. Conditions today remind himof those in 1982, another recession year. &quot;We're alwayswilling to be a little early,&quot; he says. &quot;If you bought stocksin June of 1982, you hated yourself for June, July and partof August. A year later, you felt like you were on top of theworld.&quot; Stocks tripled over the five years starting in August1982.   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., a unit of PrudentialInsurance Co. of America, is the leader for the four-yearterm of the study, with an estimated gain of 62%. StrategistGreg Smith currently recommends 65% in stocks. That makes himone of the most bullish strategists on Wall Street, though itdoesn't come close to his audacious 90% and 100% stockallocations in parts of 1987 and 1988.   Like Mr. Kerschner, Mr. Smith is optimistic because hesees the Fed riding to the rescue of the economy with &quot;lotsof liquidity.&quot; In addition, he calls the inflation outlookfor 1991 &quot;fabulous.&quot;   Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., a unit of General Electric Co., andShearson Lehman Brothers Inc., a unit of American ExpressCo., shared the asset-allocation honors for the fourthquarter, each with a 7.5% estimated return.   Shearson's strategist, Michael Sherman, has beenrecommending a 65% stock allocation for more than 10 months.He feels confident that Saudi oil facilities will escapeserious damage in the Gulf war. &quot;Lower oil prices don'tguarantee a quick economic recovery,&quot; he says, &quot;but inconjunction with lower interest rates, I think they give highodds that a recovery will take place in the last half of thisyear. Historically, the market discounts a recovery sixmonths in advance.&quot;   Kidder's tactical allocation specialist, George Boyd,recommended 60% in stocks most of the fourth quarter, butfattened that to 65% during the November rally. &quot;If you lookout a year, most of the risks which are overhanging stockswill probably be gone,&quot; he says. &quot;I think the war will beover. I think the recession will be over. The market willobviously replace these with other (risks), but they willprobably be less severe.&quot;   The worst performance for the past 12 months was turned inby Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., a unit of Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.Former Dean Witter strategist John Connolly, now a moneymanager, urged an 85% stock allocation as the year started.Stocks tumbled 6.7% in January 1990. Dean Witter officialslater toned down the firm's blend, but in so doing theymissed the year-end rally.   Dean Witter recently hired a new strategist, SureshBhirud, formerly of Oppenheimer andamp; Co. Mr. Bhirud espouses acautious blend of 45% stocks, 35% bonds and 20% cash.&quot;Although the Federal Reserve has been easing for some timenow, money growth remains dismal,&quot; he says. &quot;The economy isstill suffering from high levels of debt and sort of a creditcrunch.&quot;   For the four-year length of the study, the laggard is A.G.Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. of St. Louis. Edwards recommended theheaviest bond holdings among the 10 firms. But bondsdelivered a total return of only 36.1% for the four-yearperiod, while stocks returned 56.5%. Raymond Worseck, chiefeconomist at Edwards, says the firm has increased its normalweighting for stocks in recent years.   Last quarter, the trailer was Raymond James andamp; Associates.Unlike the other nine firms, it devotes a portion of itsasset blend to real estate-a cold area lately. It also had alarge cash position last quarter, which proved a drag onperformance. J. Davenport Mosby, a managing director, saysRaymond James's balanced approach will stand it in good steadduring periods when stocks are weak.   Some new ways of looking at the investment styles of the10 strategists have been developed by Robin Carpenter,president of Economics Office, a Cambridge, Mass., consultingfirm. Mr. Carpenter examined the study's raw data to teaseout such factors as turnover rates and concentration ratios.   Overall, he found, PaineWebber has the highest turnoverrate among the 10 firms; it tinkers slightly with itsrecommended blend each month. Shearson has the lowestturnover rate; it has recommended fewer than four changes ayear, and they generally aren't large. Raymond James has madethe largest shifts when it changes course, but since itrarely does so, its overall turnover is below average. Higherturnover can mean higher transaction costs.   The concentration ratio (Herfindahl index) measures theextent to which a firm concentrates on a single asset or two,rather than diversifying broadly. Over the four years,Prudential-Bache has recommended the most concentratedportfolios, with stocks constituting 78%, on average. RaymondJames, true to its word, recommended the most diversifiedportfolios.   An allocator's performance can be broken down into twoparts: the wisdom of the strategist's customary blend, andthe skill with which the strategist adjusts that blend formarket conditions. No firm added more than 0.4% a year to itsperformance by timing the bond market, Mr. Carpenter found.But stock-market timing was another story: PaineWebber added2.2% a year to its returns that way, and Prudential-Bacheadded 1.2%.   ---               Who Has the Best Blend?
