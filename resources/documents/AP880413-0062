At one point, Algeria adopted a policy of not acceptinghijackers after it drew critical reaction for mediating deals andwas accused of being a sanctuary for terrorists.   But it gained international prestige for helping end the crisisin which 52 Americans were held by Iranian revolutionaries whoseized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4, 1979. The hostageswere held for 444 days before being flown from Iran to Algeria andfreedom in January 1981.   The non-aligned North African nation uses secret diplomacy andmaintains a practice in diplomatic exchanges of following othercountries' wishes.   In 1985, Trans World Airline Flight 847, carrying 145 passengersand eight crew members, flew twice to Algeria in a harrowingjourney that began June 14 and ended 17 days later.   On the first day, 19 U.S. women, an American child and threepeople of other nationalities were released at the Algiers airport.The plane flew to Beirut, Lebanon the following day and thenreturned to Algiers where 53 additional passengers and five flightattendants were freed in exchange for the release of a comrade ofthe hijackers at the Athens airport.   Starting in November 1980, Algeria reluctantly agreed to work asmediator in U.S.-Iranian negotiations to free the captive embassypersonnel in Tehran.   ``A happy ending might change the American view that we arecommunists,'' a senior Algerian official said at the time.   In October 1977, Algerian officials negotiated face-to-face atthe foot of a Japanese Airlines DC-8 hijacked by Japanese Red Armyguerrillas. The negotiators secured the release of the hostages inexchange for a $6 million ransom payment and the release of six RedArmy members in Japanese jails.   Officials later indicated the hijackers were allowed to slip outof the country.   Algeria had agreed to let the plane land after a written requestfrom the Japanese government, but it was roundly denounced bypeople who said Algeria was too lax with the hijackers.   In a statement later, the government of then-President HouariBoumedienne made it clear Algeria would not agree to use forceagainst hijackers.   ``Experience has shown that it is only by accepting the demandsof hijackers that it has been possible to save the lives ofhijacked passengers,'' said the statement, transmitted by theofficial Algerian news agency.   ``All those who disagree can go ask the opinion of (hijacked)passengers,'' it added.</TEXT></DOC>
