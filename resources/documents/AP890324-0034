(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Police removed and detonated a small bombthat arrived in the mail at Montana Highway Patrol headquartersafter they were alerted by a secretary's suspicions.   ``The bomb wasn't powerful enough to blow up a building, but itcould have seriously injured someone,'' Capt. George Olsen of theHelena Police Department said Thursday evening.   Col. Robert Griffith, the Highway Patrol's administrator, saidhis secretary became suspicious of a parcel about the size of a boxof kitchen matches and addressed to ``Police Force, Capitol.''   It arrived at his office Thursday afternoon.   ``It was delivered to the mail room in the basement,'' Griffithsaid. ``When the mail was brought up to us, my secretary looked atit and felt it was a very suspicious-looking package. She said herintuition or her instinct told her she'd better not open it.''   The secretary, who was unidentified, took the parcel to stateJustice Department criminal investigators in the same building, ablock north of the Montana Capitol, and the investigators agreed thepackage was suspect and notified Helena police, Griffith said.   ``They came over and looked at it and they called the bombsquad,'' he said.   Police wrapped the parcel in a specially designed ``bombblanket,'' put it in a city dump truck filled with sand and took itto a city-run auto salvage yard north of town, said Griffith. There,police fired a shotgun into the parcel and it exploded, he said.   Griffith said authorities had no idea who might have sent thepackage, or about any motive.</TEXT></DOC>
