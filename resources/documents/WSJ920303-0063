Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6435 marks,up from 1.6390 marks late Friday. The U.S. currency also waschanging hands at 129.65 yen, up from 129.50 yen.

TheU.S. currency also was trading at 1.6430 marks, up from1.6417 marks Monday.   The dollar gained against the German currency on ahigher-than-expected reading in the National Association ofPurchasing Management's February index and drew additionalsupport from a rise in U.S. construction spending in January.   While the data &quot;raised the support platform a little bit&quot;to 1.6380 marks, they didn't provide enough impetus tochallenge technical-chart resistance at around 1.65 marks,said Carl F. Amendola, assistant vice president in New Yorkfor Bayerische Hypotheken andamp; Wechsel Bank AG.   &quot;The dollar seems pretty well supported, but no one wantsto take the first step to push it up over resistance,&quot; saidJudy Rubenstein, a vice president at BankAmerica Corp., LosAngeles.   Technical traders use charts of a currency's performancein making investment decisions; support and resistance levelsdefine the low and high ends of a currency's trading rangeand often are points where buy or sell orders have beenplaced by participants.   Instead, traders said many players, including largecorporate participants, are stepping lightly ahead ofFriday's scheduled release of the U.S. unemployment rate andnonfarm payrolls for February. The figures are expected toset the tone for the dollar over the next two to three weeks.   In the meantime, the dollar will probably fluctuate in arange of 1.63 to 1.65 marks, said Geoffrey Dennis,international economist and strategist in New York for JamesCapel andamp; Co. But yesterday's data, he said, bolstered &quot;thenotion that the U.S. economy is picking up.&quot;   The purchasing managers' index rose to 52.4% in Februaryfrom 47.4% the previous month. The rise far surpassed marketexpectations, which called for a slight improvement to around47.7%. A reading above 50% indicates the manufacturing sectorexpanded during the month, while a reading below 50% signalsa contraction.   The currency market was also encouraged by the CommerceDepartment's report that U.S. construction spending rose aseasonally adjusted 1.3% in January after a revised decreaseof 1.6% in December. The December decline was previouslyestimated at 0.2%.   But BankAmerica's Ms. Rubenstein pointed out thatbullishness on the dollar was tempered by a 0.1% fall in U.S.personal income in January. In December, personal income rose1%.   &quot;The market is still somewhat bullish (toward the dollar)overall, but it's very quick to take profits,&quot; saidHypotheken's Mr. Amendola.   The purchasers' index &quot;was unexpectedly strong, but it'snot proof positive that the economy has turned the corner,&quot;said Mr. Dennis. To sustain a bullish run in the dollar,market players &quot;need to see that employment has shown somedecent gains.&quot;   Early estimates from economists surveyed by AP-Dow Jonescall for a rise of 6,000 in nonfarm payrolls in February,after a drop of 91,000 in January.   If nonfarm payrolls expand, market observers said theyexpect the dollar to leap easily over 1.65 marks and pose aserious challenge to the next key chart point at 1.6650marks. Should that level yield, the dollar could rally ashigh as 1.68 marks, they added.   However, if payrolls contract, traders said the dollarwill be mired somewhere between 1.63 and 1.66 marks, withtechnical factors dominating dealings.   The dollar also strengthened against its Japanesecounterpart yesterday but in a razor-thin trading range of129.45-129.70 yen. Traders said the psychological barrier of130 yen appears solid for now, despite a Japanese currencythat is plagued by a listless stock market, politicalscandals and perceptions of economic slowdown in Japan.   The Japanese currency was dealt its latest blow over theweekend, when there appeared to be no consensus to support astronger yen at a meeting of finance ministry deputies fromthe Group of Seven industrialized nations.   Traders and analysts said the absence of G-7 unity onsupporting the Japanese currency took many in the market bysurprise and triggered some selling of yen holdings.   Japanese monetary officials have complained frequently inrecent weeks that the U.S. currency's rise against the yendoesn't reflect the economic fundamentals of the twocountries.</TEXT></DOC>
