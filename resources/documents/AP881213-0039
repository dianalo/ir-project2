SUAREZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A military court today acquitted theman who was Manila's security chief under Ferdinand Marcos ofcharges he plotted a 1987 coup attempt against President CorazonAquino.   The government contended former Col. Rolando Abadilla soughtthrough the coup attempt to return Marcos to power. The acquittalpaves the way for him to assume duties as a provincial vice governor.   Supporters of Abadilla cheered as the chairman of the six-membercourt read the verdict, ending the trial that began in September.   Abadilla had been charged along with several other officers ofmastermining the January 1987 takeover of television station GMA.The government said the takeover was part of a bid to reinstateMarcos, who was ousted in February 1986 in a popular uprising andlives in Hawaiian exile.   Mutinous troops holding the station surrendered about 60 hourslater, and Abadilla went into hiding. He was arrested in a Manilasuburb in July 1987 and was charged with several other offenses,including illegal weapons possession.   But all other charges had been dismissed before today's ruling.   Abadilla served as security and intelligence chief of the Manilaarea under the Marcos administration. Human rights groups have citedhim as a chief human rights offender under Marcos, though he hasnever been convicted of any crime.   In January, Abadilla was elected vice governor of Ilocos Norte,Marcos' home province, but has remained in detention in Manilapending the outcome of his legal cases. His wife campaigned for himduring the balloting.   Last May, 11 people were convicted of mutiny in connection withthe television station takeover and sentenced to 12 years at hardlabor. Ninety-five others were convicted and sentenced to shorterterms and one was acquitted.   Several other alleged ringleaders remain at large, including aformer superintendent of the Philippine Military Academy.   Abadilla also took part in the July 1986 takeover of The ManilaHotel, in which dissident officers attempted to install former Sen.Arturo Tolentino as president.   Tolentino was Marcos' running-mate in the disputed 1986 electionagainst Mrs. Aquino. The mutineers abandoned the hotel after failingto win broad support, but they were not seriously punished.   Abadilla was also charged with mastermining an April 1987 raid onthe stockade at Manila's Fort Bonifacio, a failed bid to freemutineers jailed in the television station takeover.   He was also accused of plotting to seize Villamor Air Base, nextto Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport, as part of a plannedcoup attempt in June 1987.   However, charges in the Fort Bonifacio and Villamor plots weredropped earlier this year.</TEXT></DOC>
