They're calling him &quot;Mr. Da.&quot; It comes from the Soviet leader's willingness to say &quot;yes,&quot; where earlier he had said &quot;no,&quot; to eliminating obstacles to an arms-control agreement with the U.S.    Mr. Gorbachev's seeming eagerness to strike a deal with the U.S. is confronting Western analysts with a riddle: To what extent is he masterminding a propaganda campaign designed to undermine the Atlantic alliance, and to what extent does he really want to slow the arms race?    The answer is probably a mixture of both. But a consensus seems to be emerging that Mr. Gorbachev needs an arms agreement to win the Soviet military establishment's backing for a national effort to reverse the country's economic decline. According to this view, the generals will go along with a diversion of resources to the civilian sector because they have come to realize that a revitalized economy will benefit them in the long run.    But Mr. Gorbachev's more-forthcoming approach isn't winning him the quick credibility he apparently sought. Three weeks after he proposed bold new measures to speed an agreement to remove Soviet and U.S. medium-range missiles from Europe, Western suspicions still abound on the motives behind his initiatives. And Mr. Gorbachev's frustration is growing.    In a speech he made last week during a visit by Syrian President Hafez Assad, Mr. Gorbachev mocked Western apprehensions. &quot;What does Moscow have on its mind? Why such bold steps?&quot; he asked sarcastically. &quot;Isn't behind that (boldness) just cunning and deception designed to lull the vigilance of some and divide all, and crush down on Western Europe?&quot;    He then goaded the West for failing to see what he claims is obvious: that a change in Soviet foreign policy has been precipitated by his internal drive for economic and social renewal. &quot;Is it really beyond you to understand the objective, inseparable connection of these processes with genuinely good intentions in foreign policy?&quot; he asked the West.    Many Western experts agree there is a kernel of truth in Mr. Gorbachev's link between new Soviet domestic and foreign policies. Increasingly, they are saying that without a relaxation in the world-wide superpower competition, a process that could be set in motion by an arms-control agreement, Mr. Gorbachev's drive to overhaul the sputtering Soviet economy could fail, ultimately leaving the military sector the same shambles the civilian sector is today.    Comments one senior Western diplomat with long Soviet experience, &quot;It's not as crude as just shifting money from guns to butter. Gorbachev needs to restructure economic investment and thinking. He needs to take the Soviet economy off a wartime footing.&quot;    Western observers say Mr. Gorbachev's annoyance isn't wholly justified. It was Soviet President Andrei Gromyko, dubbed &quot;Mr. Nyet&quot; when he served as foreign minister, who &quot;once warned us that behind Mr. Gorbachev's 'nice smile' lie 'teeth of steel,'&quot; one analyst notes.    And it's clear that the Kremlin is exploiting Mr. Gorbachev's initiatives for propaganda purposes. Western analysts say the conflict his arms proposals have incited between the U.S. and its European allies was certainly one of his goals. Weakening support for President Reagan's Star Wars defense plan was also carefully calculated. And that by saying &quot;yes&quot; Mr. Gorbachev is trying to shatter Russia's image as a threatening &quot;evil&quot; empire and harvest an array of political and economic benefits is, in the words of one analyst, &quot;as clear as the blue Siberian sky.&quot;    But Kremlinologists skilled at probing the tea leaves of Soviet behavior say that behind Mr. Gorbachev's eagerness for arms control probably lies his need to make a fundamental change in the way the Soviet economic system operates.    The key feature of that system, which remains basically intact since Josef Stalin created it 50 years ago to industrialize backward Russia, is that &quot;the military has near-absolute priority over everything from investment to pins and needles,&quot; says Columbia University Prof. Richard Ericson, who is in Moscow to study Mr. Gorbachev's economic reforms.    Indeed, the structure of the economy today, with most civilian industrial, transport, communication and medical facilities designed and maintained to make a quick shift to military needs, and with the best scientific minds working in the military sector, reflects as much a siege mentality as Marxist-Leninist economic theory. The system of rigid, centralized decision-making &quot;is the same kind every country turns to in a time of war,&quot; says Mr. Ericson.    Mr. Gorbachev needs the backing of the military establishment if he is to curb its growing appetite for money. And to get its support, he needs a relaxation of East-West tensions. (Soviet defense spending as a portion of gross national product rose to between 15% and 17% in 1982 from 12%-14% in 1970, according to U.S. Defense Department estimates.    Already, Mr. Gorbachev is believed to have established a consensus within the military and political hierarchies that military costs are sabotaging economic growth, which Jan Vanous, president of the Washington think tank PlanEcon Inc., estimates fell to 1.5% last year, the lowest rate since World War II.    Indeed, 25 years after Nikita Khrushchev was ousted as party boss, partly for attempting to cut outlays for the military, experts speculate that Mr. Gorbachev is winning wide acceptance for fundamental change. And he's doing so, they believe, by disseminating among the Soviet power elite secret data that proves the economy is nearing a dead end. Ultimately, Western officials speculate, the prospect of a bigger pie from which the military share will be cut is what has gotten Soviet generals to climb gingerly on Mr. Gorbachev's bandwagon.    &quot;Gorbachev has shattered the pretense that the Soviet economy works and convinced the military that when he fixes it they'll get all they need,&quot; says one Western official.    To fail to stall the arms race, Soviet officials admit privately, would eventually force the Soviet Union to forfeit its superpower status. The difficulty of the task, Western experts say, is staggering.    To bring about Mr. Gorbachev's economic reforms, central planners will have to relinquish day-to-day decision-making to middle-level managers and focus their attention exclusively on long-range strategic planning.    &quot;Only in that way can the local manager act as a sensor and put a dent in the grotesque inefficiency brought about by decades of irrationally ignoring factors like supply and demand and price formation,&quot; one Western specialist says.    Columbia University's Mr. Ericson adds that &quot;a strong psychological aspect&quot; infuses Mr. Gorbachev's new policies: He seems to recognize that working under extreme pressure inhibits creativity.    &quot;If the Soviets are under pressure to meet more and more American (military) challenges they will wind up doing it in the only way they know how: by administering everything in detail, making sure the center is on top of everything, and ultimately stifling all local initiative,&quot; he says.    Western experts say normalizing the Soviet economy would occupy at least Mr. Gorbachev's tenure in office and probably much longer. Whether during that period of retrenchment any basic changes would develop in Soviet military and political objectives is an open question. It's that uncertainty that is inducing the Western apprehensions that so anger Mr. Gorbachev. </TEXT></DOC>
