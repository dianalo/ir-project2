What does the Democratic Party stand for,as an alternative to this program? It is exceedingly hard totell because the Democrats are not an opposition party. TheDemocrats share power, they do not seek it. Seeking powerrequires submitting alternatives to the voters and competingfor their allegiance; sharing power is an entirely differentrole. The Democratic leaders in the Congress are men ofintellect and character, of decency and strength. But, theyare part of an existing power structure, almost a coalitiongovernment with a Republican administration.</TEXT></DOC>
