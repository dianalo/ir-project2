After five tense weeks, and in a desperate effort to survive, ahigh-flying company of the 1980s turned to the courts Thursday andobtained help in sorting out debts exceeding 1 billion pounds, or$1.96 billion.   Polly Peck's Turkish-Cypriot chairman and chief executiveofficer, Asil Nadir, insisted to the Financial Times that hiscompany was sound. He told the newspaper he was a victim of aGreek-inspired political conspiracy and of bungling by Britishinvestigators.   Nadir did not return a phone call from The Associated PressThursday.   The High Court on Thursday afternoon granted Polly Peck'srequest that it appoint court administrators, and assigned threeaccountants.   Court administration allows for the orderly repayment of debteither through existing operations or through the full or partialliquidation of a company's assets. It is akin to the bankruptcylaws of the United States.   The High Court dismissed a rival petition filed earlier in theweek by a creditor, the National Bank of Canada, seeking immediateliquidation of Polly Peck.   Justice Sir Robert Andrew Morritt said granting theadministration order reduced uncertainty and offered the bestchance for creditors to be repaid in full and others to benefit.   When Polly Peck's directors announced late Wednesday they haddecided on this course of action, they said it would ensure thecompany's survival.   The decision followed weeks of wrangling over financing withincreasingly nervous creditors, and came after Nadir failed to drumup the money he had promised them.   The drama began when Polly Peck suspended trading in its shareson London's Stock Exchange on Sept. 20 after the price tumbled 55percent in a matter of hours.   Creditors pressed for answers because Nadir had given banksPolly Peck shares as collateral for loans.   The stock-price dive was prompted by news that the Serious FraudOffice had raided the offices of South Audley Management Ltd., acompany linked to a Nadir family trust.   Nadir, 47, has been plagued in the British press by allegationsof links to a reputed Polly Peck stock fraud scheme. The companyand Nadir, who was questioned by the fraud office on the day of theshare collapse, have denied wrongdoing.   Polly Peck's stock had fallen sharply since August when Nadir,who then owned about 28 percent of the company, said he wanted totake it private, then abandoned the plan after five days. Theexchange criticized him for hastiness.   Nadir, who since has reduced his stake to about 24 percent,remains the largest shareholder in the conglomerate he built upover more than two decades.   The son of a wealthy Cypriot, Nadir came to Britain in the 1960sand set up his own clothing business.   Nadir, an ally of Turkish President Turgut Ozal, also developedfruit distribution, electronics, tourism and publishing businessesin Turkey and in the area of Cyprus which Turkey wrested fromGreece in 1974.   In 1980, Nadir took control of an ailing British textile companycalled Polly Peck and used it as his stock market vehicle forexpansion.   It bought the Del Monte fruit operation from RJR Nabisco Inc.for $875 million last year and Sansui Electric Co. for $135 millionin December.   The company, which employs 17,000 people, was highly profitableover the years, with Polly Peck's after-tax profit rising 16percent to $268 million on revenue of $2.27 billion in 1989. Profitmore than doubled the first six months of this year.   Polly Peck's stock was one of the best performers of the 1980s,which helped make Nadir one of Britain's richest individuals with apersonal fortune at more than $400 million.   But the staid British business world continued to consider Nadirsomething of a flamboyant outsider.   As the saga now stands, much of Nadir's wealth has vanished.Polly Peck's 23,000 shareholders have no idea how much their stockis worth.</TEXT></DOC>
