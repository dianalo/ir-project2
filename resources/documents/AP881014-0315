(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Biotechnology will boost agriculturaloutput in the 1990s, but the new science will drive a lot offarmers out of business, says an expert in the field.   Michael Phillips, senior associate for the congressional Officeof Technology Assessment, said the steady decline in the number offarmers since the 1930s will increase in the 1990s because of thehigher investments and keen management skills needed to thrive inthe biotechnology age.   ``The early adapters will benefit the most and the laggards willbe left behind,'' Phillips said Thursday at a meeting of top farmpolicy and agribusiness leaders at a two-day farm conference endingFriday.   Middle-sized farmers _ full-time farmers who annually sell lessthan a quarter million dollars worth of crops and livestock _ willfeel the biggest squeeze from the gains made in biotechnologyduring the 1990s, Phillips predicted.   Biotechnology is the use of data and techniques of engineeringand technology to study and solve problems involving livingorganisms.   Small farmers with off-farm income can almost ignore therevolution, Phillips said, but medium-sized farmers will have toscramble to keep up with farmers who will have an easier timeadopting the new biotechnology processes.   The squeeze on the middle-sized farms means that by the year2000, 86 percent of the nation's food will be produced by only 14percent of the farmers, Phillips predicted.   He predicted that the first wave of agricultural biotechnologybreakthroughs will come in livestock production, while most of theadvances in plant agriculture will not be available to farmersuntil the late 1990s.   Walter Hobgood Jr., director of animal nutrition and health forMonsanto Agricultural Co., said a new hormone which will beinjected into cows every two weeks to boost milk production couldbe on the market as early as next year and will be adopted by mostdairy farmers in the next five years.   Phillips predicted a genetically engineered hormone that willmake hogs grow faster and leaner will be approved and ready forsale to farmers by about 1995.</TEXT></DOC>
