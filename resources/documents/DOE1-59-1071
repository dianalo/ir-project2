He says one issue is the thought thatthe SDI as a focused program of technical investigation looking at possibleweapon architectures, as opposed to merely a broad-based research program,might turn out to be a one-president excursion in American policy. Thatis why our allies and the Soviet Union are thinking about the realityof SDI with regard to possible weaponization as opposed to merely thetroublesome things that we are actually researching. The author saysSDI is the kind of program, which for the first time in decades, reallywould give us leverage over the structure of the Soviet strategic program.He also says the Europeans are not yet convinced that SDI is needed becausethey aren't convinced the wheel of deterrence is broken, so why fix it?</TEXT></DOC>
