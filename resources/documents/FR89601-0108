No separate applicationkit is either necessary or available for submitting an application. Ifyou have a copy of this announcement, you have all the information andforms required to submit an application.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>In 1974, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (the Act) establishedthe NCCAN in the Department of Health and Human Services. It is locatedorganizationally within the Children's Bureau of the Administration forChildren, Youth and Families in the Office of Human Development Services.The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect conducts activities designedto assist and enhance national, State and community efforts to prevent,identify and treat child abuse and neglect. These activities include: Conductingresearch and demonstrations; supporting service improvement projects; gathering,analyzing and disseminating information through a national clearinghouse;providing grants to eligible States for strengthening and improving childprotective service programs; and coordinating Federal activities relatedto child abuse and neglect through an Advisory Board on Child Abuse andNeglect composed of 13 members from the general public and two membersfrom the Federal Inter-Agency Task Force and an Inter-Agency Task Forceon Child Abuse and Neglect composed of Federal agencies. The Act has been amended several times, most recently by the Child AbusePrevention, Adoption, and Family Services Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-294,which was signed into law on April 25, 1988. This announcement reflectsthe research and demonstration priorities and solicits applications underthe authority of the Act (42 USC 5101 <T3>et seq.</T3>) as amended. As required by section 6(a)(2)(B) of the Act, the Office of Human DevelopmentServices (OHDS) published for public comment proposed fiscal year 1989child abuse and neglect research and demonstration priorities in the December30, 1988 <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 53065). NCCAN received 110 responses fromnational, State and local child welfare and human service organizationsand advocacy groups, professional associations, universities, hospitals,practitioners, representatives from government offices and elected officials,and private citizens. These comments included overall support for the priorityareas proposed, support and comments specific to a number of the priorityareas, and suggestions for new topics. The final priorities selected forfiscal year 1989 were prepared after consideration of all comments receivedand are described below in Part II. The priority areas on joint police/childprotective investigations, risk assessment, results of research on childas witness projects, and professional child abuse and neglect trainingcurricula are being carried over into FY 1990 for consideration as arethe suggestions for new topics.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Fiscal Year 1989 Priorities for Research and Demonstration Projects</ITAG>This part contains the information needed in order to successfully applyfor funding. Failure to comply with the eligibility criteria and deadlinefor submittal of applications will result in an application being screenedout and not considered for funding. The screening criteria can be foundin Part III. B, Application Screening Criteria. Office of Human DevelopmentServices' experience has shown that an application which is broad and generalin concept does not score as well as one which is directly responsive tothe concerns of a specific priority area. Applicants must identify the specific priority area under which they wishto have their application considered. On all applications developed jointly,one organization must be identified as the lead organization and applicant.A. Available Funds Approximately $5.5 million is available for grants in FY 1989. To the extentthat selected proposals exceed the amount available for funding in FY 1989,some proposals may be deferred for funding until FY 1990, subject to theavailability of funds. B. Grantee Share of the Project There is a 25% non-Federal share matching requirement for demonstrationand service programs. The non-Federal share represents 25% of total projectcosts. The Federal share plus the non-Federal share equals the total projectcosts. In other words, for every three dollars of Federal support, a minimumof one dollar must come from a source other than the Federal government.For example, if the Federal funding requested is $100,000 per year, thecost sharing or match must be at least $33,333 per year with a total projectcost of $133,333. There is no cost sharing or match requirement for researchgrants. In addition, territories are not required to provide a match forany grant proposal. C. Grants Administrative Regulations The non-Federal share matching requirement may be in cash or third partyin-kind contributions in accordance with 45 CFR Part 74 and/or Part 92.For State and local governments, including Federally recognized IndianTribes, 45 CFR Part 92 and selected parts of 45 CFR Part 74 are applicable.For all other applicants, 45 CFR Part 74 is applicable. D. Research Priorities The following research priority areas have no cost sharing requirement:<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Family Functioning of Neglectful Families </ITAG>Within the framework of families as systems, there is little informationabout the ways that neglectful families function in comparison with non-neglectfulfamilies. There are many issues that need to be researched within the familyframework to enhance an understanding of neglectful families and providemore information for prevention and intervention strategies. There arealso many methodological issues which should be addressed in developingresearch proposals, including the use of operational definitions and addressingpotentially compounding factors in sampling and/or analysis, such as socioeconomicstatus, culture, and ethnicity. Additional factors to consider includefamily size and structure, divorce, employment, autonomy of individualfamily members, cohesion and adaptability of the family system, and accessto and utilization of such support services as child care, respite careand other community based and related services. Research questions proposed in this priority area are: andbullet; Can differences in functioning be identified between neglectfuland non-neglectful families? andbullet; What are the characteristics of the men in neglectful vs. non-neglectfulfamilies? What functions do they serve in the family, and how do they impacton family functioning? andbullet; How do mental health problems and/or substance abuse (includingcrack cocaine and street related drugs) relate to family functioning andneglectful families? andbullet; How does level of family functioning relate to neglect? andbullet; What facilitates prevention of neglect in at risk families? andbullet; At what point in the family system is intervention most effective?andbullet; Which intervention strategies are most effective? NCCAN will fund studies for up to 36 months duration at a Federal levelnot to exceed $150,000 per project per year. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Community-Based Prevention of Child Maltreatment </ITAG>A number of community-based prevention strategies have been utilized, andthere is the need to examine the knowledge and experience of the fieldto date. Research in this priority area should include a three-part literaturereview and evaluation of approaches to ongoing community-based preventionof child maltreatment, as follows: andbullet; Review and analyze literature and materials on the developmentof community prevention programs for child abuse and neglect and otherfields with respect to the following issues: Community planning and development,planning models, effective fund-raising, types of community leadership,and prevention approaches.andbullet; Identify and classify existing community-based prevention programs,including those developed under Children's Trust and Prevention Funds andChallenge Grants. The study should attempt to measure the program's relativeeffectiveness, the geographical area of the State covered, funding sources,groups targeted, and other factors. andbullet; Synthesize materials and findings in a manual (and/or other disseminationmodes) on how to plan, fund, initiate, implement and maintain community-wideprevention programs, with emphasis on empirical findings on ways of producingchange. NCCAN anticipates funding one or more 36-month projects at a Federal levelnot to exceed $150,000 per project per year.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Prosecution of Child Maltreatment Cases </ITAG>Little data have been aggregated regarding the number, type and outcomesof judicial handling of child abuse cases. NCCAN is interested in approachingthis informational need in two parts. One is to carry out a study of thenumber and types of child abuse and neglect cases prosecuted and the outcomefor the nation as a whole. The second is to address the following researchquestions related to sexual abuse, physical abuse, and neglect, by levelof risk. An experimental or quasi-experimental design is recommended usingcases matched by type of abuse, age of child, family composition, and severityof injury. andbullet; What kinds of cases are referred for prosecution? andbullet; Which cases that were prosecuted went to trial and were convicted?andbullet; To what extent are criminal child abuse and neglect cases coordinatedwith parallel civil child abuse and neglect proceedings? andbullet; How does early prosecutorial involvement affect conviction orreunification rates? andbullet; How does the composition of a multidisciplinary team affect prosecutorialdecision making? andbullet; How can multidisciplinary teams be managed to maximize interagencycommunication between child protective services and criminal justice systems?NCCAN plans to fund projects for a 36 month duration at a Federal levelnot to exceed $150,000 per project per year. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Judicial Review Process  </ITAG>Abused and neglected children who are placed in foster care as a protectivemeasure are thereafter covered by the provisions of the Adoption Assistanceand Child Welfare Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-272, which has a goal of permanencyfor the child either through rehabilitation of the child's own home orthrough an alternative placement. Pub. L. 96-272 also requires periodic <T3>judicial </T3>review of foster care cases to insure that goals aremet in a timely manner. Research is needed to determine how these judicialreviews are conducted in various jurisdictions and how this review processspecifically addresses and contributes to treatment and rehabilitationof abusive and/or neglecting families, including support of these childrenin foster care. Consideration may also be given to examining all modelsof the review process. Questions to be addressed include: andbullet; How do States and jurisdictions implement the judicial reviewprocess and how are the child abuse and neglect issues considered in thisprocess (e.g., how are the frequency of the review, sources of data forthe review, and progress towards goals affected by the type and severityof the incident of child abuse and neglect)? andbullet; What are the outcomes of judicial reviews for abused and neglectedchildren (e.g., redirection of services, increased monitoring, additionallegal sanctions, reduced recidivism, length of foster care, proportionreturned home or freed for adoption, etc.)? andbullet; What are the various models of review used and what are the relationshipsamong various types of reviews (e.g., judicial, administrative, and citizen)?andbullet; Which review systems, alone or in combination, are the most effectivein assuring permanency for abused and neglected children? NCCAN anticipates funding projects of up to 36 months duration having aFederal level not to exceed $150,000 per year. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Impact of Treatment Approaches for Intrafamilial Child Sexual Abuse </ITAG>Little objective data exist on the use of incarceration and diversion programsfor cases of intrafamilial sexual abuse and how treatment approaches canbe used effectively to improve outcomes for children and families. Thispriority proposes to support a comparative multi-site study (to includea rural site) on intrafamilial sexual abuse that would include: andbullet; Incarceration_without treatment; andbullet; Incarceration_with treatment;andbullet; Diversion program_pre-trial and post-trial; and andbullet; Probation with no formal intervention program. The study should focus on the outcome indicators for the victim, the offender,and the family unit. In particular, the outcomes need to address recidivism,cost of the program and victim and family functioning. An advisory committee,to include juvenile/family court judges, women's groups and other appropriateprofessionals, is recommended. The purpose of this study is to provideinformation for decreasing child victimization and critical and usefulinformation for the judiciary system to assist them in making effectivesentencing decisions.NCCAN anticipates funding 36-month projects having a Federal level notto exceed $125,000 per project per year. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Status of Measurement Development in the Study of Child Abuse andNeglect </ITAG>A substantial body of research knowledge has accumulated through the use,development and adaptation of an array of measurement techniques. Thereis the need for a state-of-the-art review of measures and instruments utilizedin studies of child abuse and neglect. These measures may concern children,their families, and communities and include demographic characteristicsand environmental settings; parent-child and family interactions; childsocial-emotional development and school performance; family strengths,needs, resources, and stress factors; social and economic support systems;and service availability and provision. This should cover psychometricproperties, including validity and reliability; domains addressed for theinstruments; identification of any gaps and next steps to be taken in theiruse; and adaptation or development of new measures. It is not intended,however, that the actual development of new measures take place at thistime under this priority area. Anticipated products from this project are a paper on the state-of-the-artof instrument development, a directory of measurements/instruments establishedas a computer file with a proposed strategy for ongoing maintenance, ahard copy reference directory for research applications and a manual forpractitioners, a recommended set of common data elements to be collectedacross studies to enable comparability, and a library set of these measuresand manuals for their utilization. NCCAN anticipates funding one project for 24 months not to exceed a Federallevel of $75,000 per year. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Field Initiated Research for Child Abuse and Neglect </ITAG>NCCAN is interested in supporting new research initiated by researchersin the child abuse and neglect field to carry out the legislative responsibilitiesestablished for the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect by the ChildAbuse Prevention, Adoption, and Family Services Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-294.One of these responsibilities is to conduct research on the causes, prevention,identification and treatment of child abuse and neglect, and on appropriateand effective investigative, administrative and judicial procedures incases of child abuse. One-half the funds available for this priority areawill be made available for research on prevention of child abuse and neglect.Basic research in the behavioral and social sciences which contributesto theory development is not within the purview of this announcement. Also,it is not intended that program evaluation and demonstration projects beincluded in this category. Current issues having widespread impact on thefield of child abuse and neglect and on the target population are of particularinterest. Secondary analyses of data from the 1986 study of the national incidenceand prevalence of child abuse and neglect will also be considered. Publicuse data tapes and the documentation manual from this study are availablefrom the Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect Information, P.O. Box1182, Washington DC 20013. Applicants should list all organizations to be involved on the projectwith a description of their contribution. Written assurances should beincluded with the application. Applicants should also show that they havethe ability to gain access to necessary information, data, etc. Applicantsshould clearly demonstrate an indepth understanding of the issues and problemsassociated with child abuse and neglect and provide an up-to-date literaturereview. NCCAN will fund studies for up to 36 months duration at a Federal levelnot to exceed $150,000 per project per year depending on the questionsto be answered, the intensity of the effort proposed, and the generalizabilityof the anticipated results. Through this priority area, NCCAN seeks toprovide a comparative process for field generated topics. <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Consortium for Longitudinal Studies of Child Maltreatment</ITAG>NCCAN intends to support a consortium of longitudinal studies to addressaspects of the life course of families at risk of child maltreatment. Thesestudies are expected to contribute to the knowledge of the etiology andecology of child maltreatment and provide new insights into prevention,treatment and the organization of protective services (both public andprivate).   The consortium of longitudinal studies will have two parts: (1) A centralgrantee to oversee methodological issues and perform data analyses, and(2) satellite grantees who will identify data sources, collect and submitdata to the central grantee for analysis. A two phased funding approachis anticipated for this priority. During Phase One, NCCAN will fund a planninggrant for a central grantee and up to three planning grants for satellitegrantees. The central grantee is expected to provide an experimental longitudinalstudy design which addresses sampling, a core set of measurements, anddata collection and analysis plans. The satellite grantees are expectedto propose the location of sources of data, obtain agreements to participate,propose a data collection procedure and carry out pilot testing of theproposed instruments. They may propose to initiate new studies or collectdata from ongoing studies compatible with the longitudinal study design.They will have the opportunity to develop their own special analyses alongwith those about which they collaborate with the central grantee. Federalfunding for Phase Two, the implementation of a consortium of longitudinalstudies, will be based on a determination of the feasibility of the totaleffort.   NCCAN seeks proposals for a central grantee to oversee methodological issuesand support the work of satellite grantees who will collect data and turnit over to the central grantee for analysis. This grantee will be responsiblefor establishing an experimental design, sampling procedures, a core setof measurement instruments, and data collection procedures to be used byall the grantees.   The central grantee must demonstrate methodological expertise in everyaspect of longitudinal study work including the measurement of childrenand family systems, psychometrics, sampling, experimental design, tracking,data storage and statistical analysis. The choice of instruments and procedureswill be decided jointly by the central and satellite grantees and theirconsultants and staff of NCCAN. The central grantee will be expected tohave staff and consultants expert in every area of methodology and childmaltreatment.   The satellite grantees will be responsible for identifying appropriatesources for subjects and controls and arranging for data collection. Thesegrantees are expected to expand on the core data collection instrumentsand to perform such additional analyses as they deem appropriate. Theyare expected to demonstrate expertise in child maltreatment and field work.Grantees must agree to surrender their data to the central grantee andarrange for associated child protection agencies to agree to transfer dataunder procedures that insure anonymity of subjects.   An annotated bibliography on longitudinal studies of child maltreatmentcan be obtained from the Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect Information,P.O. Box 1182, Washington, DC 20013.   For this particular priority area, applicants are encouraged to apply forboth or either of these grants. Separate applications are required.   NCCAN will fund projects in Phase I to develop designs for the study for12 months with a Federal level not to exceed $60,000 for the central granteeand $30,000 for the satellite grantees. Upon completion of Phase I, NCCANwill fund for a five year period and possibly longer pending statutoryauthority and availability of funds, one central grantee with a Federallevel not exceeding $100,000 per year and three satellites with a Federalshare not exceeding $33,000 per year. Additional satellite projects maybe funded in the future.      E. Demonstration and Service Program Priorities Except for territories, applicants for the following demonstration priorityareas must provide a 25% non-Federal share matching requirement: <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Utilizing Results of Demonstration Grant Clusters </ITAG>Over the past several years NCCAN has funded clusters of grants relatingto a common program theme in child abuse prevention and treatment. Theseprojects are valuable to the communities they serve and for the knowledgeand program expertise they have generated which can be transferred to othercommunities to improve child abuse and neglect services. The field needsto become more aware of successful, relevant programs that have reasonablecosts and are easily adapted and implemented. For several of the successful cluster grant programs there has been nofinal effort to evaluate and synthesize the results from individual projectsinto a cluster report for the field, including a review of individual finalreports and other materials developed by the projects which reflect informationabout objectives, implementation strategies, costs and outcomes. Thereis a need for various organizations or agencies with experts in the field,who have special interests in the subject matter either by virtue of theirprofessional or academic experience, to distill and synthesize the significantproject findings into reports to the field, including development of utilizationstrategies. Dissemination strategies appropriate to the needs of varioususer groups also need to be addressed. Three grant clusters which have a solid body of information suitable forthis analysis include: (a) Parent Aide and Respite Care Programs; (b) Education of School-aged Children to Prevent Child Sexual Abuse andDevelopment of Educational Materials Geared to Preschool-aged Childrenand Adolescents; and (c) Models to Assist Teenage Mothers in Preventing Child Abuse and Neglect.NCCAN anticipates funding projects for up to 18 months with a Federal sharenot to exceed $75,000. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Adaptation of Child Sexual Abuse Training Curricula for Demonstrationwith Native American Populations </ITAG>Child sexual abuse is recognized as pervading modern society with estimatesthat, by the age of eighteen, 15-25 percent of girls and 3-10 percent ofboys will be sexually abused. The Native American population is no exception.Several curricula have been developed and used to train children, parentsand teachers on: (1) How to talk about and cope with past child sexualabuse, and (2) how to prevent future child sexual abuse. Many experts believethat the manner of presentation and the environment in which the materialis presented affects how children accept and incorporate the information.An educational setting is believed to be a non-threatening environmentto children and a teacher is often viewed as a responsible person thatthe children will trust and communicate with openly. It is also importantto involve the school administration and parents to ensure their full support.Examples of curricula recognized in the field include the following: andbullet; <T3>Talking About Touching. A Personal Safety Curriculum </T3>(1984) RuthHarms and Donna James, Seattle, Washington: Committee for Children, Gradelevel: 1-5; andbullet; <T3>Personal Safety Curriculum: Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse </T3>(1983)Geraldine Crisci, Hadley, Massachusetts, Grade level: Preschool_6; andbullet; <T3>Personal Safety: Curriculum for Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse </T3>(1982),Marlys Olson, Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Program, Tacoma, Washington:Tacoma Public Schools, Grade level: Preschool_6. An annotated bibliography of curricula for prevention of child sexual abusecan be obtained from the Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect Information,P.O. Box 1182, Washington, DC 20013. NCCAN is interested in funding demonstration projects to adapt existingchild sexual abuse prevention training curricula for children in preschoolprograms through elementary school grades six on or near Indian reservations.The projects should include training for the teachers to implement theprogram as well as for the parents and children. Applicants shall conducta literature survey, review the state of the art curricula, and selectthe curricula suitable for adaptation for the Tribe(s). Eligibility for this priority area is limited to Federally recognized IndianTribes, national Indian organizations, Native American colleges and universities,and other institutions of higher education which have a history of servingthe educational needs of Native Americans. Applicants should include onthe project as staff or in an advisory capacity selected Tribal memberswho are also parents. Applications must include letters of commitment fromthe Tribal Councils detailing their proposed involvement in the programincluding their agreement to work with the curriculum addressed in theapplication.NCCAN will fund projects for 24 month periods having a Federal share notto exceed $100,000 per project per year. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Parents' Self-help Group </ITAG>From its inception, NCCAN has supported efforts of national networks ofparent self-help groups that utilize techniques of self-help for the treatmentof parents who abuse and neglect their children and also serve as a resourceto other troubled parents who believe that without this help they mightharm their children. As these groups have expanded in the States and localcommunities, they have become a significant part of the intervention strategyfor working with these parents and their children. NCCAN is interested in continuing to support parent self-help programsof demonstrated effectiveness which are national in scope. These programsshould include furthering the development of a national focus, public awareness,and network of parent self-help groups either by establishing new groupsand/or by strengthening the capacity of existing groups. Examples of activities that might be considered under this priority areaare: andbullet; Strengthening the relationships between parent self-help groupsand public and private agencies which serve abused and neglected childrenin order to encourage consistent use of parent self-help as part of theintervention strategy; andbullet; Enhancing public awareness and outreach programs to at risk familiesto encourage self referral; andbullet; Increasing accessibility through recruitment and training of parentsfor participation in self-help groups, and transportation and staff consultation;andbullet; Promoting the further development and expansion of local chapterswhich have limited resources; andbullet; Promoting the development of State resource organizations in Statesthat do not now have them: andbullet; Enhancing the capacity for local chapters and State organizationsto network and participate in national leadership development and agendabuilding; andbullet; Supporting the preparation and dissemination of written materialsfor chapter leadership and development; andbullet; Developing prototypes for varying needs (e.g., abused spouse andchild, abuse by relative outside the home or stranger).  NCCAN anticipates funding one or more projects to national parent self-helporganizations for up to three years for the furthering of the developmentand expansion of parent self-help groups at a Federal share not to exceed$150,000 per project per year. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Prevention of Physical Child Abuse and Neglect </ITAG>Considerable evidence is available which suggests that reports of childabuse and neglect are increasing and that the State child protective servicessystem does not have the capacity to respond effectively. Further, whilea large percentage of these reports are unsubstantiated, a significantnumber of additional cases go unreported. There is the need, therefore,to once again focus on and support comprehensive community-based approachesto the prevention of child abuse and neglect capturing and utilizing theknowledge developed over the past decade. NCCAN has supported many research and demonstration projects in prevention.Additionally, Children's Trust and Prevention Funds have been establishedin 48 States, and 44 States have received Challenge Grant funds to establishprevention programs in child abuse and neglect. Through these and otherrelated efforts designed to prevent child maltreatment, a wide varietyof prevention strategies are being utilized in communities across the UnitedStates. However, these are scattered and may not include the full rangeof components necessary to reach all children and families who may be atrisk or in need of help. NCCAN is interested in providing support for the planning and developmentof model comprehensive community-based physical child abuse and neglectprevention programs to address local needs in a number of urban, suburbanand rural communities across the country. These model programs should bedesigned to minimally consist of the following components coordinated ona community-wide basis: andbullet; Public awareness programs for citizens about positive parentingand positive family support; andbullet; Prenatal health care and parenting education and support programsfor all new parents (including home health visitor programs) that acknowledgeand reinforce parental responsibility for their children; andbullet; Support services for parents under stress that encourage parentparticipation (such as child care, respite care, crisis nurseries, helplines,self-help groups and other natural helping support networks in the community,provision for linkages and continuity of care and services, housing andother basic necessities, and job training); andbullet; School-based age specific prevention education programs for allschool age children; andbullet; Coordination between child abuse and neglect services and domesticviolence programs; andbullet; Therapeutic care for victims and perpetrators of abuse; home basedtransition and follow-up services for children and their families;andbullet; Projects for the prevention of alcohol and drug-related childabuse and neglect including substance abuse as a component of parentingeducation and curriculum training programs. Additional components may include the following: andbullet; Hospital-based (or whatever health facility may be available ina rural area) information and referral services for parents of childrenwith handicaps and children who have been neglected or abused by theirparents; andbullet; Multidisciplinary training programs for professionals involvedin the planning and implementation of these model community programs; andbullet; A community-based interdisciplinary task force, including thecitizens and the private sector, to plan, develop, implement, and overseethe model community prevention program. NCCAN will fund up to ten grants for a five year period for the planningand development of model programs for prevention of physical child abuseand neglect. Successful applicants are expected to participate in a commondata collection and evaluation effort. One grantee will be selected fromamong the successful applicants to serve as consortium leader for the datacollection, evaluation and networking effort and additional funds willbe available for this effort. Applicants should state their interest inbeing the consortium leader and provide a brief description of their capabilityto do so. It is not anticipated that funds will be used for direct services.The Federal share will not exceed $200,000 per project per year. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. General Information and Requirements for the Application Processand Review </ITAG>This part contains general information for applicants and basic requirementsfor submitting applications in response to this announcement. Applicationforms are provided along with detailed instructions for developing andassembling the application package for submittal at the end of this section.A. General Information <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Review Process and Funding Decisions </ITAG>Applications will be reviewed and scored competitively against the publishedevaluation criteria (see III D of this announcement) by experts in thefield, generally persons from outside of the Federal government. A formalreview process established in accordance with section 6(e) of the Act willbe conducted in Washington, DC. The results of this review will be a primaryfactor in making funding decisions. The Office of Human Development Services reserves the option of discussingapplications with, or referring them to, other Federal or non-Federal fundingsources when this is determined to be in the best interest of the Federalgovernment or the applicant. To the extent possible, final decisions for demonstration projects willreflect the equitable distribution of assistance among States, geographicareas of the nation, rural and urban areas, and ethnic populations. TheOffice of Human Development Services will also take into account the needto avoid duplication of effort in making funding decisions. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Executive Order 12372_Notification Process </ITAG>This program is covered under Executive Order (E.O.) 12372, ``IntergovernmentalReview of Federal Programs,'' and 45 CFR Part 100, ``IntergovernmentalReview of Department of Health and Human Services Programs and Activities.''Under the Order, States may design their own processes for reviewing andcommenting on proposed Federal assistance under covered programs. All Statesand territories except Alaska, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, AmericanSamoa, and Palau have elected to participate in the Executive Order processand have established Single Points of Contact (SPOCs). Applicants fromthese seven areas need take no action regarding E.O. 12372. Applicationsfor projects to be administered by federally-recognized Indian Tribes arealso exempt from the requirements of E.O. 12372. Otherwise, applicants should contact their SPOC as soon as possible toalert them of the prospective application and to receive any necessaryinstructions. Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOCas early as possible so that the program office can obtain and review SPOCcomments as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicantsubmit all required materials, if any, to the SPOC and indicate the dateof this submittal (or date of contact if no submittal is required) on theSF 424, item 16a. SPOCs have 60 days from the grant application deadline date to commenton applications for financial assistance under this program. SPOCs areencouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as officialrecommendations. Additionally, SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiatebetween mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendationswhich they intend to trigger the ``accommodate or explain'' rule.When comments are submitted directly to OHDS, they should be addressedto: FY 1989 NCCAN Research and Demonstration Program, Office of Human DevelopmentServices, Grants and Contracts Management Division, Room 345F, Hubert H.Humphrey Building, 200 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20201.OHDS will notify the State of any application received which has no indicationthat the State process has had an opportunity for review.
