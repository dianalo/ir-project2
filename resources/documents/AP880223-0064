WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Soviet Union has promised to be more flexiblein granting emigration visas to its citizens, Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz said after conducting two days of talks withKremlin officials.   However, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said the matterof emigration was not open to negotiation.   Soviet officials traditionally define emigration policy as aninternal matter. To improve relations with Washington, however,they may have agreed privately to a more lenient look atapplications.   Shultz said at a news conference Monday that his meetings withShevardnadze and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev produced``helpful clarifications'' on human rights. Shultz describedhumanitarian concerns _ divided families, Jews refused permissionto emigrate, and free expression and practice of religion _ as themost important subject on his agenda.   Shevardnadze, in contrast, said the meetings focused on ``thepivot of Soviet-U.S. relations'': prospects for concluding a treatyby late spring that would reduce the strategic nuclear weapons ofboth nations by 50 percent.   He said human rights questions ``are being resolved by us moreforcefully than before,'' and characterized discussion ofemigration and personal freedoms as a Kremlin initiative theAmerican delegation welcomed.   Last year 8,011 Soviet Jews were allowed to emigrate _ eighttimes the number granted exit visas the previous year.   Jewish emigration activists in the West claim fewer visas havebeen issued since the December summit in Washington betweenGorbachev and President Reagan.   Jewish emigration reached a peak of about 51,000 in 1979, butdropped off as U.S.-Soviet relations worsened.   Shultz told reporters, ``We got some helpful clarifications,particularly on emigration policy, where we were assured therewould be flexibility on applications requiring potential immigrantsto have first-degree relatives abroad.'' Emigration regulationsthat took effect in January 1987 allow Soviets to seekreunification only with spouses, siblings and parents.   Refuseniks, those denied permission to leave, complain that thenew laws make it more difficult for those seeking to joingrandparents, cousins and other relatives.   The secretary said: ``There had been some misunderstanding aboutthis and that has been straightened out, at least for the balanceof this year.   ``I'm glad that Foreign Minister Shevardnadze confirmed quitecategorically that the only barrier to emigration is past workinvolving state secrets.''   Soviets who have performed work considered of vital nationalimportance, or that makes the worker privy to classifiedinformation, are routinely denied exit visas.   According to Shultz, his assistant secretary of state forhumanitarian affairs, Richard Schifter, had encouraging meetingswith Soviet counterparts, including representatives of theCommunist Party Central Committee Secretariat and the InteriorMinistry, which oversees the visa-issuing office.   Shevardnadze held a news conference later and was asked whetherthe promised ``flexibility'' meant the year-old regulations wouldbe revised, or the understanding was an informal one between thetwo governments.   He responded: ``As far as the internal legislation of ourcountry is concerned, we are not discussing these matters with thesecretary of state.''   Shevardnadze acknowledged ``reassessments'' were in progress onemigration and other policies Western officials define ashumanitarian concerns, but declined further comment.</TEXT></DOC>
