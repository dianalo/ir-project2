The officials also described life in the captured city ofKuwait, where they said resistance to the Iraqis, led byneighborhood cooperatives and Kuwaiti women, continues tobuild.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We are willing to sacrifice everything -- not only ourmoney, but also our blood -- for the liberation of ourcountry,&quot; said Crown Prince Saad Abdullah al-Sabah, thesecond-ranking official in the Kuwaiti government.   He and Ali Jaber al-Sabah, brother-in-law of the emir ofKuwait, said that some Kuwaitis who had fled the oil-richPersian Gulf country have been infiltrating back to organizearmed resistance. Some of them are officers of Kuwait'smilitary.   Mr. Jaber, who is also marketing director of thestate-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corp., said the company isbuying 250,000 barrels of oil a day from Saudi Arabia andother Gulf states and will continue to supply its gasolinestations and refineries in Europe.   The two Kuwaiti officials spoke at a hotel in this resortcity in the mountains near Jeddah and the Red Sea. The hotel,tightly guarded by Saudi soldiers, has been turned into theexile headquarters of the Kuwaiti government. It is near thesummer palace of King Fahd, the ruler of Saudi Arabia. Saudiofficials flew foreign reporters from Dhahran, Saudi Arabia,to the news conference here.   Mr. Jaber said dynamite had been attached to what arecalled &quot;Christmas trees,&quot; elaborate systems of valvesattached to the tops of oil wells. He said the Iraqis so farhaven't wired detonators to the explosives. If Kuwait'sfields were damaged by explosions, he said, they could bebrought back to production within six months.   Citing reports from within Kuwait, he said the Iraqi armyhas attempted to stop demonstrations and other acts ofdisobedience by women and children by arresting them andimprisoning them in two downtown palaces. He described thepalaces as &quot;concentration camps&quot; where some women are beaten.   Nonetheless, he said, the demonstrations continue, withwomen taunting the Iraqi soldiers from the rooftops everynight, shouting &quot;Allahu akbar&quot; to indicate that they fearonly God.   Iraqi soldiers, according to Mr. Jaber, fear snipers andhave stopped patrolling at night, leaving the streets togroups organized by neighborhood residents to preventlooting. Other teams, mostly young men, collect garbage andhelp distribute food.   Young Kuwaitis, he said, have killed Iraqi cab driversbringing carloads of looters from Basra in Iraq. They alsohave firebombed vans loaded with stolen furniture as lootersdrove them north into Iraq.   Iraqi soldiers, he said, also have been looting eachother. &quot;The Iraqi soldier who steals cars and takes them tothe border is often met by a bigger fish who takes it fromhim,&quot; said Mr. Jaber. He explained that the &quot;bigger fish&quot; isusually a more senior military officer.   He said Kuwaiti workers continue to pump 200,000 barrelsof oil a day from the captured fields, just enough to run thelocal power plant and water desalination facility. Otherwise,according to Mr. Jaber, Kuwaitis generally are refusing toreturn to work.   Mr. Jaber confirmed news reports that a warning fromKuwait's Defense Ministry thwarted an Iraqi attempt tocapture the emir and the crown prince when Iraq's tank forcesinvaded Kuwait in the early hours of Aug. 2.   Although enemy helicopters were landing at the emir'spalace, the two rulers managed to escape by car, drivingsouth to the Saudi border.   &quot;The Kuwaiti government is alive and well,&quot; the crownprince told reporters. &quot;We are receiving reports from ourbrothers in Kuwait and from our embassies all over theworld.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
