Last Saturday, it was crowdedwith shoppers and sidewalk vendors, most of whom areCaribbean immigrants. The street is cheerful, vibrant andcolorful. That is, until one reaches the block where policebarricades have cordoned off two Korean fruit markets thathave been the object of a boycott since mid-January.Suddenly, the mood turns ominous.   I went shopping on Church Avenue last weekend with afriend. We wanted to see for ourselves the confrontation thatpresented New York's Mayor David Dinkins with his firstcrisis in office.</LP><TEXT>   According to press accounts, the dispute began when aHaitian customer had an altercation with the owner of the RedApple market. The participants give different accounts of thedispute's origin: either the customer refused to pay the fullamount for her purchases, and hostile words were exchanged;or the shop's owner insulted and struck the customer. Thepatron is suing for $6 million.   Whatever happened should be and presumably will beresolved by the legal system. Meanwhile, Robert &quot;Sonny&quot;Carson, a well-known figure in racial disputes in Brooklyn,has led a movement to close down both the Red Apple andanother Korean-owned fruit market across the street, theChurch Avenue Fruit Market. Mr. Carson, who once wasconvicted of kidnapping and is notorious in the city for hisanti-Semitic and anti-white views, claims these merchants donot respect blacks and has determined to put them out ofbusiness.   On the day that I visited the Red Apple, the block waslined with police barricades, and the store was guarded bydozens of New York City police officers in riot gear. About50 demonstrators stood behind the barricades about eight feetfrom the store, shouting at passers-by not to enter. Thelawyer for the fruit markets had obtained a restraining orderrequiring the demonstrators to stay 50 feet from the stores,but the demonstrators have ignored it and the police haverefused to enforce it.   At the street corner, several yards from the Red Apple, alarge booth with a loudspeaker system bombards passers-bywith recorded invective against whites, &quot;Uncle Tompreachers,&quot; the power structure, and a variety of otherenemies. The booth is festooned with black nationalistparaphernalia. The atmosphere is surreal, like a carnivalwhere people are enjoying themselves by being enraged.   Thus, entering the store is like running a gantlet. Notmany people have been willing to do so. The Guardian Angelshave shopped there, and a black high-school teacher broughthis class one day. But the teacher has since asked for atransfer from his school as a result of pressure by someparents and fear for his safety.   Once inside, we found half a dozen Korean men and womensitting quietly and dejectedly. The displays were filled withfresh fruits and vegetables, but we were the only customers.There was an eerie silence and a mood of grim determination.   Only one of the Koreans, a young man, spoke English. Weexpressed our support, and he thanked us. My friend boughtsome fruit. There was something terribly sad about the plightof these people, sitting in their empty store, struggling tomake a living. It seemed to me that if they were prejudicedagainst blacks, as Sonny Carson claims, they would be out ofbusiness without his intervention, since almost all of theavenue's shoppers are black, and there are many other fruitmarkets on it.   As we left, the demonstrators muttered hostile comments,but nothing more. Two blocks away, however, we encountered amarch of about 150 blacks, on their way to the two stores. Itwas Sonny Carson's Flatbush Frontline Collective, shoutingslogans like &quot;Boycott]&quot; &quot;No respect, no peace]&quot; &quot;Shut itdown]&quot; and &quot;No more Red Apple] No more Church Fruit]&quot; Themarchers carried red-green-and-black pan-African flags andshook their fists. They were protected by about 100 policeofficers.   I thought about the Koreans. They no doubt feared not onlyfor their livelihood but their lives. Did they understandwhat was happening, or the glib newspaper stories thatrationalized the conflict as &quot;a clash of cultures&quot;?   Having come to maturity in the 1960s, I pondered whichside of the barricades Martin Luther King Jr. would have beenon. He won great moral stature because he always pitted thepowerless against the powerful. He asserted the claims ofjustice against unjust laws and practices. His actions andwords had moral force because he appealed to moral law, whatthe Founding Fathers called natural law.   I could not see King railing against half a dozenfrightened Korean fruit vendors. He preached love andforgiveness, not hatred and vengeance. I could not imaginehim leading the marchers on Church Avenue. They bore astriking resemblance not to his followers, but to the whitebigots who screamed epithets at the frightened black childrenwho integrated schools in Little Rock 32 years ago.   Last week, Mayor Dinkins delivered an eloquent statementagainst racism and prejudice, but he has avoided any directinvolvement in the confrontation on Church Avenue. Hiscommissioner of human rights is conducting negotiations thathave dragged on for four months. When the commissioner wasasked on television why the mayor did not personally breakthe boycott, he said that the mayor was mediating the disputeand did not find it useful to take sides.   Where are the champions of civil rights and civilliberties? Where are our legislators, who are quick to votefor civil-rights bills in Washington and Albany but absentwhen civil rights are on trial in New York City? Why haven'tbusloads of church groups and college students and laborunions and others who care about human rights descended onChurch Avenue to support these powerless Korean fruitmerchants who seek nothing more than the right to earn anhonest living?   ---   Ms. Ravitch is a historian of American education atTeachers College, Columbia University.</TEXT></DOC>
