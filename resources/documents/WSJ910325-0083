Yet Korean voters, many of whom fought on the streetsagainst the government in 1986 and 1987 for just such anopportunity, have been greeting the election for localrepresentatives with a mixture of apathy and cynicism. Manysee the balloting less as an important building block ofdemocracy and more as a possible guide to likely aspirantsfor next year's presidential election.</LP><TEXT>   Tuesday's election is important as &quot;a first step, and itputs pressure on (the government) for the next step,&quot; says aWestern diplomat following the democratization process. &quot;Butthe elections will be measured by whose fortunes they advancefor the presidency.&quot;   The councils formed from the poll's winners will have ameasure of autonomy in local matters, as opposed to thecurrent system in which all decisions have been made by thecentral government. Local councils were suspended after a1961 military coup. &quot;It is an important step&quot; because itcreates momentum for further democratization, says HanSung-Joo, a professor of political science at YonseiUniversity.   The local elections will be followed by voting in May forprovincial and city councils. That poll is expected togenerate considerable attention because the stakes arehigher. Unlike the local elections, those candidates will runon party tickets. Therefore, the provincial council electionswill give a clear picture of a party's strength on the locallevel.   National Assembly elections will be held next year, withpresidential elections following at the end of the year.   But Tuesday's vote has found civic interest at a low ebb.&quot;In theory, the local elections should be the stepping stonetoward democracy, but right now people are very skeptical ofthe capability of local autonomy,&quot; says Chang Dal-Joong, aprofessor of political science at Seoul National University.   South Korean newspapers are predicting that only about 50%of the nation's 28.7 million eligible voters will go to thepolls, despite the government declaring it a nationalholiday. By comparison, about 90% of eligible voters turnedout for the presidential election in December 1987.   Moreover, public support for both ruling and oppositionparty members is below 15%, many recent polls have reported.&quot;I don't know who the candidates are,&quot; said a businessmaninterviewed on the street. Added a housewife: &quot;Someone elsewill vote, so why should I bother?&quot;   &quot;The real political problem in Korea is not in theradicals, but in the general alienation of the people towardpoliticians,&quot; says Prof. Han of Yonsei University.   There was a flurry of activity over the weekend, withsmall rallies and volunteers passing out brochures on manystreet corners, so the turnout may be higher than predicted.But observers say the government did little to build voterinterest. Some note that the election was hastily called justthis month. &quot;They rushed this thing, so nobody knows what isinvolved,&quot; Mr. Han says.   In addition, the rules as to who could run have beencalled confusing, regulations on electioneering have beenrestrictive, and the role of the local councils wasn't evenclarified until after the candidates had registered to run.   With a majority of the 10,120 candidates aligned with theruling Democratic Liberal Party, those affiliated with themain opposition party, the Party for Peace and Democracy, areexpected to fare poorly. If that proves true this week, and asimilar outcome follows in the provincial council elections,PPD leader Kim Dae-Jung may be forced to step down in favorof an opposition coalition led by a fresher face.   Should that happen, it would make it harder for KimYoung-Sam, the former opposition party leader who joined theruling party last year, to claim the nomination as the DLP'spresidential candidate. He is thought to be the onlycandidate who could win against Kim Dae-Jung, his longtimepolitical rival. &quot;He needs Kim Dae-Jung as much as he hateshim,&quot; says Prof. Han.   The South Korean Constitution prevents a president fromserving two consecutive terms. President Roh Tae-Woo has madeit clear he will step down after the elections.</TEXT></DOC>
