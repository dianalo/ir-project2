From a tinycompany struggling in the scrubland of West Texas, TCI hasbuilt itself into the world's biggest cable-televisionenterprise. One of every five American cable users is wiredinto TCI in one way or another, and about 20% of theindustry's entire revenue flows to this behemoth.   To many of its rivals and customers, though, TCIrepresents not the best but the worst in American business --a monopolistic, strong-arm bully, they say, that squeezesother cable operators, denies free competition to programmersand flagrantly disrupts the plans of rivals. The &quot;ringleader&quot;in the &quot;cable Cosa Nostra&quot; is what Sen. Albert Gore Jr. ofTennessee calls TCI. Contends Mel Cohen, the mayor ofMorganton, N.C., where TCI operates a cable system: &quot;TCI istrying to crush our city government.&quot;                                                                                                          TCI, which owns more than 1,000 cable systems, is alsovery tightly controlled. Bob Magness, TCI's founder andchairman, and John C. Malone, its chief executive, built anddominated the company in part through internal self-dealing,an investigation by The Wall Street Journal shows. In onecase, the two sold to TCI a group of Utah cable systems thecompany apparently already owned.   Their stock transactions -- often only partially disclosedin federal filings and usually unavailable to othershareholders -- may or may not have violated securities laws;the law prohibits corporations from withholding importantinformation from shareholders. But the objective of thedealings appears clear. Through these and other transactions,the two men built one of the most influential and fearedcompanies in the television industry, and granted themselveseffective control over it. Many contend that consumersultimately paid the price, as TCI worked to squelchcompetition in the cable industry.   TCI emphatically denies engaging in any questionabletransactions with its top two officers, or anyone else forthat matter. Any suggestion that &quot;when we paid Magness andMalone shares we were paying them for assets we already ownedis false,&quot; a spokesman says. He cautions, however, that thedenials and elaborations are based on the &quot;collectiverecollection&quot; of TCI executives, and that he didn't consultMessrs. Magness and Malone, who declined to be interviewedspecifically about the transactions. Further, the companysays it was unable to retrieve records from storage that bearon the internal stock dealings.   The spokesman says allegations the company is a bully inthe market are also false. He says TCI just tries to offerthe best service at the best possible price, amid risingcompetition.   For his part, Mr. Malone does say in an interview that, ingeneral, TCI's transactions with its top officials are merelya way of supplementing salaries and teaching top brass aboutdifferent aspects of the cable business. &quot;TCI has one of thelowest, if not the lowest, salary structures in corporateAmerica,&quot; he said. The deals have &quot;allowed us to build wealthover time.&quot;   Messrs. Magness and Malone are paid a bit under $500,000 ayear each and control a combined 36% of shareholder votes inTCI. When TCI spun off some assets into a company calledLiberty Media Corp. -- a move designed to answer charges thatTCI had become too dominant -- the two executives quicklyacquired 56% of the voting shares of that company, too. Themarket value of their combined holdings is nearly $700million.   The accumulation of that wealth and the sheer girth of TCIwill undoubtedly draw the interest of the U.S. Senate thisweek, as lawmakers begin debating whether the cable industryhas become monopolistic and whether additional regulation isneeded. TCI and Liberty Media operate in 48 states and dwarftheir next-largest rival, Time Warner Inc. TCI alonegenerates cash flow of $1.7 billion a year -- more than ABC,CBS, NBC and the Fox network combined. Annual revenueapproaches $4 billion. TCI and Liberty own stakes in four ofthe top 10 cable channels and have an interest in nine of thetop 25, including Cable News Network, Turner BroadcastingSystem, Turner Network Television, the Discovery Channel andBlack Entertainment Television.   The company's critics say TCI's vertical integration --ownership of both the local cable systems and the channelsthat provide programming for those systems -- gives it unfairpower and is one of the best arguments for greater regulationof the industry. The company's outside shareholders, however,couldn't be happier. A dollar invested in TCI stock in themid-1970s is worth more than $800 now. TCI has &quot;given us atremendous return,&quot; says Keith Hartman, with AssociatedCommunications Corp., an investment company in Pittsburgh.Associated's $7 million investment in TCI in 1979 has swelledto well over $300 million. If TCI were sold today it wouldprobably fetch at least $15 billion.   No shareholder has benefited more than Bob Magness, acigar-chomping, roughhewn rancher who started TCI with thepurchase of a single system in Memphis, Texas. At age 68, heis worth over $500 million. For all his wealth, Mr. Magnesseschews the life style of the rich and famous. For twodecades he has lived in a modest ranch house atop a plateauoverlooking Denver. &quot;You go to his house for dinner andeveryone takes his shoes off, more or less,&quot; says RudyWunderlich, a friend. The cable magnate has been known toshift a cigar to a corner of his mouth, resting it therewhile eating a T-bone steak. &quot;He ain't very happy in atuxedo,&quot; another friend says.   These days, Mr. Magness spends little time on TCI'sday-to-day affairs. He raises horses and collects Westernart, passions he pursued with his first wife and businesspartner, Betsy. She died in 1985, and he has since remarried.   He formed his cable company in 1956. As lore has it, Mr.Magness, a short and rugged Oklahoman, sold some cattle forfunds to buy the franchise in Texas. (A franchise is theright to build and operate a cable system, and is usuallyawarded by local authorities.) From there, he and Betsy begancollecting cable systems in Montana, Nevada, Colorado andUtah.   By the mid-1960s, Mr. Magness needed backers. He found twoin Salt Lake Citythe Gallivan family, which owns the localnewspaper, Salt Lake City Tribune, and the Hatch family,owners of local television station KUTV. (The family isn'trelated to that of Sen. Orrin Hatch.)   The investment by the Hatch family would prove problematicyears later, when the federal government barred&quot;cross-ownership&quot; of local TV stations and cable systems inthe same community. But with the families' help, Mr. Magnessincorporated TCI in 1968 and took it public in 1970.   By 1973, though, TCI was flirting with bankruptcy: Mr.Magness, it seemed, lacked the skill to build and manage TCIas a modern enterprise. So he turned to Mr. Malone, a youngConnecticut native and Yale-educated financial virtuoso whowas then the president of a TCI supplier.   Shortly after taking over as TCI's president, Mr. Malonesummoned TCI's impatient lenders to a meeting, the storygoes, and gave them an ultimatum: either back off or takeover the company. The lenders backed off, and TCI was able torefinance. Its quest for expansion resumed, fueled bymountains of new debt.   Today, Mr. Malone, age 50, is cable's most visible andformidable figure. He crafted the industry's $560 millionrescue of Ted Turner's debt-laden business in 1987, whichenabled TCI to gradually take a 25% stake in TurnerBroadcasting System Inc.   Yet for all of his influence, the soft-spoken Mr. Maloneremains a stranger to many in the field. Says cable brokerBill Daniels, who shares a skybox atop Denver's Mile HighStadium with Mr. Malone: &quot;I just don't know anyone close tohim.&quot;   Mr. Malone, who holds two master's degrees and a doctoratein operations research, has served as TCI's strategic thinkerand financial alchemist, deftly managing the company as aportfolio of cable assets and buying, shifting, marrying anddecoupling them in ways that boosted their value. More thanany other industry executive, Mr. Malone pulled the financialcommunity onto the cable bandwagon, getting Wall Street tofocus on the business's surging cash flow.   But that higher profile had a downside: It increased thechances that TCI might become a target of corporate raiders.   That risk grew in 1979 as Salt Lake City's Hatch familyprepared to sell off its sizable stake in TCI to comply withthe ban on cross-ownership. &quot;With the Hatches gone, -Mr.Malone- felt the company was more vulnerable,&quot; says JamesHoak Jr., a former executive at Heritage Media, a TCI-ownedgroup of cable systems.   What to do? TCI started to address the problem in 1979 bycreating a new class of stock, Class B shares, that had10-to-1 voting power over the more widely held Class Ashares. Now TCI had only to find a way to get the bulk of theClass B shares into friendly hands -- such as those ofMessrs. Magness and Malone.   Thus began a series of transactions so complex they almostseemed designed to befuddle. First, the Hatch family's TCIstake was acquired by an investment concern calledTele-Communications Investment Inc., which after thetransaction controlled 24% of TCI Class B voting stock and43% of the weaker Class A shares. Through a previoustransaction, TCI owned half of that investment company, soTCI's management thus controlled half of the investmentcompany's vote. But TCI management apparently was looking fora way to gain an even tighter grip on TCI.   Messrs. Magness and Malone embarked on a bout oflabyrinthine self-dealings that ultimately would have TCI paythem a huge chunk of the super-voting shares. In one case,the dealings involved four separate companies with almost theexact same name -- two owned by Messrs. Magness and Malone,two owned by TCI -- and the swapping of Utah cable franchisesand systems among them.   Acting through small subsidiaries, TCI first bought upfranchises around Salt Lake City. Then TCI transferred thefranchises -- it isn't exactly clear how -- to separateMagness and Malone companies with almost the same names asthe TCI units. Later, TCI bought the Magness and Maloneentities -- even though TCI had owned some of the franchisesin the first place.   The price: nearly one million of the super-voting Class Bshares, which TCI paid to Messrs. Magness and Malone overfive years. The stock, amounting to 13% of all shareholdervotes by early 1991 and worth about $140 million at the time,essentially gave the two top executives enough voting power,when added to their existing stakes, to block any move theydidn't like.   Records don't make it clear, but it appears thetransactions could have gone one of at least two ways:Messrs. Magness and Malone paid only a small sum for TCI'sUtah franchises and sold them back at a huge profit; or thepair received the franchises free and sold them back to thecompany. Either way, the transfers weren't disclosed to theSecurities and Exchange Commission.   What is known about the transactions is this:   The deals began in 1979. Because of the cross-ownershipban, and because the Hatch family stake in TCI hadn't yetbeen sold, TCI couldn't pursue any new cable systems in theSalt Lake City market, the company said in public filings.TCI nonetheless wanted the unawarded Utah franchises in&quot;friendly hands,&quot; Mr. Malone recalled in an interview.   So the TCI board urged Messrs. Magness and Malone to formtheir own private company to pursue the Utah franchises, withthe idea that TCI would ultimately buy the properties fromthe executives. They and their immediate kin set up a newentity: Community Cable of Utah Inc.   TCI, it turns out, had a subsidiary that used that samename as a trade name. Through that subsidiary, and despitethe ban on cross-ownership, TCI had already applied for andreceived quite a few Utah cable franchises, governmentrecords show.   For example, in 1979 the towns of Spanish Fork, Sandy,Salem, and Payson City all awarded franchises to a TCIsubsidiary known as Community Cable of Utah Inc. But thisCommunity Cable of Utah, records show, was registered inNevada. The Magness and Malone-owned Community Cable wasincorporated in Utah and was, legally, a separate andunrelated entity.   All of these franchises, however, would end up belongingto Messrs. Magness and Malone. Records don't make clear howthis happened.   In February 1981, after the Hatch family stake in TCI hadbeen sold, TCI acquired Messrs. Magness and Malone'sCommunity Cable of Utah, paying them and their family members360,000 Class B shares of TCI. The company's assets, listedin disclosure documents, included at least one of the verysame franchises and the system built under it -- Sandy --that TCI's Community Cable unit had acquired a few yearsearlier. The assets also included 260,000 shares of Class Astock.   TCI executives give contradictory accounts of how TCI'sSandy franchise ended up as the property of Messrs. Magnessand Malone. First, Bernard Schotters, a TCI spokesman, saidthe franchise had belonged to the two executives to beginwith, but that Sandy officials insisted on naming the TCIsubsidiary as the official owner.   Then, he and another spokesman, Robert Thomson, revisedthe explanation to say that TCI, indeed, had first owned theSandy franchise, but had &quot;assigned&quot; it to another Magness andMalone entity, Community Television of Utah. In return,Messrs. Magness and Malone &quot;paid&quot; TCI by granting TCI theright of first refusal to buy the Sandy property back.   But local records show that Community Television of Utahisn't owned by Messrs. Magness and Malone -- it is yetanother unit of TCI. The various explanations, moreover,contradict a filing TCI made with Sandy officials in the late1980s: In it, TCI said it had received the Sandy franchiseback in 1979, when TCI was telling shareholders that it wasfederally barred from doing so because of the crossoverrestrictions. Today, in explaining its past actions, TCI saysit was wrong to tell shareholders that it couldn't own afranchise; in fact, TCI says, it was permitted to seek afranchise, but not to own and operate the cable system builtunder the franchise.   TCI and its two top officers and their families, who nowwere flush with the additional 360,000 Class B shares, thenrepeated the self-dealing. What they gained, again, wasgreater control of TCI itself. Here's how it worked:   -- In selling their Community Cable to TCI, the two menheld back five cable systems covering 12,000 homes in centralUtah. TCI never identified the specific systems in publicfilings. But records indicate they were the franchises thathad been granted to TCI's Community Cable of Utah through a100%-owned TCI unit. In any case, Messrs. Magness and Malonenow owned them and shifted them into yet another new entitywith the same name, TCI says today. This version of CommunityCable of Utah was registered in Colorado.   -- In April 1983, they exchanged the five systems for a21% stake in a new TCI company formed to make acquisitions.TCI valued the assets of their Community Cable of Utah at$3.8 million. The acquisition company, meanwhile, went on tobuy another cable system.   -- In December 1985, TCI bought out the two men's stake inthe acquisition company. The price: 600,000 shares of Class Bstock in TCI, worth almost $23 million. On the same day, TCIpaid them another 50,000 Class B shares, valued at $1.9million, to acquire another 21% stake the two men had in yetanother TCI entity, which had purchased a cable system inBuffalo, N.Y. That 21% stake had cost the two just $210,000only a year earlier, according to TCI proxy statements.   TCI's two spokesmen, Messrs. Thomson and Schotters,provide contradictory explanations for the turn of events.   First, Mr. Schotters said TCI itself obtained most of thefive Utah franchises in question -- despite TCI's earlierclaim, in proxy statements, that it wasn't allowed to do so.He said TCI, it turns out, was allowed to seek franchises --it just couldn't build and own the systems. Messrs. Magnessand Malone did the building outside of the TCI corporateumbrella with TCI financing, he said. But he added that TCIisn't sure whether it ever transferred ownership of thesystems to the two men.   Later, the TCI spokesmen said the Magness and Malonecompany had been awarded at least two of the franchisesinvolved by Utah authorities. But local records show all fiveUtah franchises were directly awarded to TCI's subsidiary.TCI can't explain whether it transferred the rights to itstop two executives -- or when, or for what price.   Combined and adjusted for stock splits, the more than onemillion Class B shares that TCI paid Messrs. Magness andMalone over the years became 10.5 million Class B shares asof January 1991 -- before Liberty Media was spun off -- worthalmost $140 million and equal to about 13% of all TCIshareholder votes.   Today the Magness and Malone combined holdings give thetwo veto power over any decisions at both TCI and LibertyMedia, thanks in part also to substantial payment of Class Bshares they've received under their employment contracts.   As the two men built their empire, leaving behind thismaze of dealings, they were slowly developing a reputationfor hardball tactics with local governments and rivals. Sixyears ago, for example, TCI began waging war on Morganton,N.C., population 28,000.   The battle was over the company's cable franchise inMorganton, which was expiring and which the town councildecided not to renew. Service was &quot;atrocious,&quot; Mayor MelCohen charges today, and the town began studying whether tobuild its own cable system.   TCI argued that government ownership would be illegal andcountered by suing Morganton, asking $35 million in damages.The town won, but TCI has been appealing the decision eversince, continuing to collect $1.3 million a year in localcable revenues. At one point, TCI offered to sell the systemto a buyer group. But the town balked after learning one ofthe buyers was partly owned by TCI.   Then last year, TCI hired a lobbying firm that formed&quot;Citizens Opposed to City-owned Cable.&quot; The group gatheredpetition signatures to force a vote by citizens on whetherthe cable system should be owned privately or by thegovernment. Morganton officials contend there was a catch:The petition included a measure -- drafted by TCI -- thatwould have virtually guaranteed TCI a lifetime franchise ifthe vote was in favor of private enterprise. The local boardof elections rejected it, and another court battle was on.   Undeterred, TCI targeted Mayor Cohen and an incumbent towncouncilman for defeat in elections last Oct. 8, the mayorsays. The TCI-funded citizen group ran as many as threenewspaper ads a day in the three weeks preceding theelection. One pictured two buzzards sitting on an electricline and read: &quot;Morganton politicians are sitting high on theperch.&quot;   All told, TCI spent about $144,000 on the campaign --dwarfing the $400 to $600 the incumbents say they each spentto get re-elected. In the end, the mayor and the councilmanboth were re-elected.   TCI's Mr. Thomson generally confirms the events inMorganton but says he expects the two sides to settle thedispute. &quot;We anticipate calmer heads will prevail,&quot; he says.   TCI has played a similar form of hardball with its rivals.Its source of power lies in the fact that the sheer size ofits systems can make or break a new channeland keep a rivalchannel from reaching many American households. That sizealso gives it enormous leverage in demanding lower pricesfrom independent channels.   The company's move into programming began in earnest in1979 when it invested $180,000 in a start-up called BlackEntertainment Television. From the mid-1980s on, TCI acquiredstakes of 5% to 50% in American Movie Classics, the DiscoveryChannel, the Family Channel, and Turner Broadcasting and itsthree cable outlets, Cable News Network, Turner NetworkTelevision and Superstation TBS.   Critics say TCI displayed its power last year when itfought to win control of the Learning Channel, anaward-winning educational channel that was 51%-owned bytroubled Financial News Network Inc.   FNN was bound for bankruptcy-court proceedings, and it putthe Learning Channel up for sale. Several bidders emerged,including the Public Broadcasting System, the Lifetime cablechannel -- and Discovery Channel, 49%-owned by TCI.   Initially, analysts estimated the Learning Channel mightbe worth $80 million or more. But as FNN's woes worsened,offers dropped. Lifetime offered $40 million, outbiddingTCI's Discovery, and began negotiating a final deal. Then TCIelbowed in. TCI's Mr. Malone suddenly decided that theLearning Channel had declined in quality, and he orderedTCI's local cable systems -- which accounted for as many asone-third of the channel's total subscribers -- to dump theservice.   That, of course, made the Learning Channel a lessattractive property to the bidders at Lifetime, which isowned by Capital Cities/ABC Inc., Viacom Inc. and HearstCorp. Executives from Hearst and ABC descended on Mr. Malonein Denver and pleaded with him to keep the Learning Channelon TCI systems, according to officials with Lifetime. Theyoutlined plans to improve the channel and pledged to freezethe rate paid by TCI systems for the channel for two years.   But Mr. Malone said TCI couldn't promise it would carrythe redone channel if the sale went through, according topeople familiar with the meeting. Today Mr. Malone says hehad worried that a bankruptcy judge might force TCI tocontinue carrying the channel. He also says that, in hisopinion, Lifetime's revival plans weren't firm. &quot;We wanted toput them on notice that we have no obligation to carry&quot; thechannel, he says. He also said TCI was concerned that theLearning Channel would raise its rates after it was acquiredby Lifetime.   Lifetime soon abandoned its bid. A short time later, theLearning Channel got another buyer -- TCI's DiscoveryChannel, which snapped up the Learning Channel for $31million. After making some programming changes, TCI decidedit was fine after all, keeping it on many, though not all,TCI systems. TCI's chief operating officer, J.C. Sparkman,says that TCI &quot;had nothing to do with whether Lifetime orDiscovery&quot; acquired the Learning Channel, and that TCI didnothing untoward during the bidding.   Another rival has also complained about TCI's extensivecontrol over both the medium and the message. Home ShoppingNetwork's chief executive, Roy M. Speer, charged in testimonyto congressional subcommittees last year that TCI&quot;systematically refuses&quot; to carry Home Shopping on TCIsystems because of its own sizable stake in a rival channel,QVC. (Liberty now holds the QVC stake.)   Home Shopping managed to sign up only 3.7% of TCI'ssubscriber base, although its sign-up rate was 47% for mostother top cable operators, the service said in a 1990 filingwith the Federal Communications Commission. Home Shoppingsaid TCI was thus depriving it of hundreds of millions ofdollars in revenue and was increasing its costs.   Mr. Speer declined to be interviewed. But in his testimonyhe detailed years of alleged discrimination by TCI. TCI'sEnglewood, Colo., system once told Home Shopping it couldn'tcarry the network because it competes with QVC, Mr. Speersaid. In 1988, TCI directed two systems it had acquired inPasco County, Fla., to cancel Home Shopping and replace itwith QVC, he said. In April 1990, TCI's top Californiamanager told Home Shopping there was &quot;no way&quot; his systemscould carry it, given that TCI had a stake in QVC, Mr. Speercharged.   TCI denies it discriminates against Home Shopping butdeclines to comment further. In a letter last summer to Sen.Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, TCI said it believes it is HomeShopping's largest carrier, accounting for one-quarter ofHome Shopping's viewers.   The fortunes of QVC, meanwhile, are soaring. While HomeShopping Network posted an $8.9 million loss on one-timecharges in its most recent fiscal year, QVC reported almost$5 million in profit in the first half on $391 million insales, which were up almost 22%.   If TCI can be hard on rivals, it sometimes is no moregentle with consumers. Last summer it launched Encore, alowpriced movie channel, using the &quot;negative option&quot; --subscribers all had to pay extra for it unless theyexplicitly told TCI they didn't want it. The company figuredthat putting the burden on customers to say no promised tocorral 80% of TCI households for Encore. It also says it hadto use the strategy because of technical limitations in manyof its cable systems. A Texas newspaper called the strategy&quot;sneaky,&quot; others said it was anti-consumer, and a judgehalted it. At least 10 states sued, and TCI had to abandonthe gimmick nationwide.   But the setback was something of an exception. Usually TCIgets its way. In 1985, for example, when General ElectricCo.'s NBC network set plans for an all-news cable channel,officials assumed it &quot;couldn't happen without TCI,&quot; recallsLawrence K. Grossman, president of NBC News at the time. Butin the end, TCI merely played NBC off against CNN, whoseprogramming the cable company was already carrying. Accordingto Mr. Grossman, TCI used a proposed alliance with NBC to getprice breaks from CNN, and then backed away from the NBCproposal.   Several years later, NBC tried again. By this time, TCIhad taken a stake in Turner Broadcasting. To win TCI'ssupport, NBC promised that its new channel, CNBC, would focuson business and finance instead of running an all-news formatthat would compete with Cable News Network, say peoplefamiliar with the transaction. NBC also agreed to pay TCI $20million for a fledgling TCI channel called Tempo. Sen. Gore,in a 1989 Senate hearing on media ownership, called thatpayment a &quot;shakedown&quot; by TCI.   NBC Chairman Robert Wright and TCI scoffed at theshakedown allegation, and TCI denied it had forced NBC toavoid competing with CNN. But Mr. Wright testified that mostcable companies &quot;required, if you will,&quot; a non-competeprovision and said it &quot;wasn't exactly what we would havepreferred.&quot; TCI and NBC have since joined in several businessventures.   Afraid that TCI's dual role in owning cable systems andchannels would prompt the federal government to try to breakup the company, Messrs. Magness and Malone conceived a planthat would appear to do just that -- while letting themretain total control of the empire.   Last year TCI spun off $605 million of assets in the formof a new company, Liberty, and sold Liberty to TCIshareholders by giving them the option of swapping some oftheir TCI shares for shares in the new company. But TCI setup Liberty as a second vertically integrated company withcable systems of its own.   What's more, Liberty purports to be an independentcompany, but it employs mostly TCI people, has Mr. Malone asits chairman, and has five TCI executives on its board of sixdirectors.   &quot;This so-called spinoff should be renamed `All in theFamily,'&quot; said a critical staff report to the Senate CommerceCommittee.   Liberty shares have more than tripled in price from anoriginal $230 to $770 a share in less than a year of trading.The swift rise has some analysts wondering whether theappreciation is warranted. &quot;It is ridiculously overvalued,&quot;contends Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran AssetManagement Inc., a money management company. He recentlyadvised clients to dump Liberty shares.   Messrs. Magness and Malone own 56% of Liberty'sshareholder votes and were able to grab such a dominant stakebecause many other shareholders in TCI didn't elect toparticipate in the swap.   Under Mr. Malone's control, Liberty has been especiallygenerous to him; he owns 164,000 shares worth $126 million.Records show he obtained 100,000 Liberty shares throughoptions in lieu of salary in one fell swoop, even though hiscontract at the time limited him to 20,000 shares a year forthe next five years. In October, Liberty directors let Mr.Malone exercise all of the options at once.   Exercising the option cost Mr. Malone $25.6 million, buthe had to put up only $100,000 in cash, according to Libertyfilings with the SEC. Moreover, Mr. Malone raised the moneyby selling part of his personal stake in Liberty's QVCchannel back to Liberty. He gave the company a $25.5 millionnote for the rest of the stock, with a low annual interestrate of 7.54%. Mr. Malone later paid off part of the debt bygiving Liberty some of his TCI stock.   To lessen their risk when Liberty was spun off, Messrs.Magness and Malone structured the deal to insulate themselvesfrom any losses, even if it meant damaging Liberty itself.Under the terms they set -- which weren't available toLiberty's outside shareholders -- Liberty must arrange thepurchase of stakes held by the two executives and theGallivan family, the early TCI backer, at a guaranteed priceif these shareholders are ever forced by regulators todivest. The guaranteed price is an average of the stock'sprice over a specific trading period.   &quot;The actions {Liberty} may be required to take in order tosatisfy such obligations . . . could have an adverse effecton the company's business, financial condition andprospects,&quot; the company warned in SEC filings.   ---        Tele-Communications Inc.: Colossus of Cable                                                                                                          TCI's corporate structure; unless noted in parenthesis,ownership is 100%                                                                                                                        TELE-COMMUNICATIONS INC.
