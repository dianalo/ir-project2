But not everyone in this boarded-uptown is joining in the parade.   The company says the investment -- in a continuous slabcaster by its USS steelmaking division -- ensures thesurvival of steel in the industry's cradle, the depressed MonValley region near Pittsburgh. The steel giant had consideredabandoning the region entirely during steel's skid in the1980s.</LP><TEXT>   There aren't many steelworkers left in Braddock tocelebrate, though. In the past decade, USX reduced employeesin the area to 4,000 in three plants from 30,000 in fiveplants as the company focused its activities more onflat-rolled sheet steels for such customers as auto andappliance makers. The union says the new caster will actuallycut employment by as much as 400, but the alternative --shutting down -- was worse.   For USX, the project is a nostalgic return to its roots:The caster will be part of the Edgar Thomson plant, AndrewCarnegie's first steel mill, and the bagpipers will recallthe steel mogul's Scottish heritage. The equipment the casterwill replace, vintage 1938, would have been more appropriateto Mr. Carnegie's time.   The dual-strand caster, which will be completed inmid-1992, will have an annual capacity of 2.6 million tons.Continuous casting eliminates several laborious andenergy-intensive steps in making flat-rolled steel,significantly reducing processing time and lowering costs.The state-of-the-art caster will also improve quality.   Pittsburgh-based USX agreed to build the caster in a laboragreement reached in 1987. It also plans a similar-sizeinvestment to rebuild a nearby strip mill, which will use thesteel made in Braddock.   &quot;It's a recommitment to the Mon Valley,&quot; USS PresidentThomas C. Graham says of the caster. But, he adds, &quot;itcouldn't transform (the valley) back on the scale that itonce was.&quot;   Braddock Mayor Thomas Napolitano isn't expecting anymiracles, either, though he says Braddock will take what itcan get. &quot;When they put that kind of money in a town likethis, you know they're going to stay for a few years.Hopefully, we'll get something back in this town.&quot;   Braddock's population, which 25 years ago was about20,000, is down to 4,600. When steel left town, so did themovies, jewelry stores, even the grocery store. For a while,the only work to be found was in boarding up or knocking downbuildings. Locals describe it as a giant parking lot with nocars.   Braddock folks &quot;don't know what (the caster) is, but theyfigure something new is coming in,&quot; said Paul Tkach, aretired steelworker in Braddock.   But nobody expects a return to prosperity for the MonValley. &quot;No way,&quot; said Mr. Tkach. &quot;It'll never be that wayagain.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
