<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-73-0229 </DOCNO><TEXT>Two small angle neutron scattering instruments, a pinhole instrument anda double crystal diffractometer, are available at the FRJ-2 test reactorat the Kernforschungsanlage Juelich. Both instruments are described,and their applicability in materials research is illustrated by the characterizationof helium bubbles between 2 and 10 nm in diameter formed by ion implantationin nickel, and of creep induced pores of micrometre size in high temperaturealloys. Additionally, the helium gas density in the bubbles can be determinedusing the contrast variation method. (author). 10 refs, 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
