(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United Mine Workers is urging otherunions and their supporters to withdraw funds from banks lendingmoney to Pittston Group as part of a campaign designed to pressurethe coal company into negotiating a contract.   In addition, the UMW is ``organizing for a possible boycott ofall Pittston subsidiaries, includinferenceMonday and set a Jan. 31 strike deadline if Pittston doesn't agreeto a new contract with 2,000 members in three states.   Pittston President Gene Matthis said a strike would be``unfortunate'' and severely affect communities in which the companyhas coal operations.   Trumka said the union's campaign against Pittston will ``increasepressure against the company on all fronts'' to negotiate.   The campaign has included demonstrations in New York, Washington,Richmond and Greenwich, Conn., where Pittston is headquartered. Theunion also planned an advertising campaign in the Wall StreetJournal and in local newspapers in the coalfields and in Connecticut.   ``Our campaign is designed to reach out to the company during theholiday period and shortly after the first of the year and try andget them back to the bargaining table,'' Trumka said.   The UMW president said he announced the strike deadline more thana month in advance because ``we want to give every lastopportunity'' to a negotiated settlement. ``This gives us 47 days towork out an settlement.''   ``We want to go the last step, the last mile, to see if anagreement can be reached,'' Trumka said. ``But this is one unionthat has never run from a fight, and we're prepared to fight thisone.''   ``We think it would be most unfortunate if the union would carrythrough with this,'' Matthis said. ``It would create a lot ofhardship in some of these communities.''   Matthis has said the company will continue to operate if theunion strikes.   Pittston miners in West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky have beenworking without a contract for 11 months, since the 1984 nationalcoal contract expired last Jan. 31. Trumka said there have been nonegotiations since Nov. 9, when Pittston gave the union ``atake-it-or-leave-it-offer.''   ``The `offer' they made would eliminate the eight-hour day,''Trumka said. ``It would weaken safety rights, force our members towork on Sundays and substantially increase their out-of-pockethealth care costs. It would allow the company to gain exclusivecontrol of our pension plan _ including the ability to unilaterallychange or cancel it at any time.''   Pittston dropped out of the national coal industry bargainingorganization before negotiations began for the 1988 agreement,saying the company's needs were different than those of the rest ofthe industry. The union has accused the company of engaging in``surface bargaining,'' however, and contends Pittston hasdemonstrated no interest in reaching an agreement.   ``We can't discuss their needs because they haven't told us whattheir needs are,'' Trumka said. ``They've sent mid-level managers(to the negotiating table) with no authority to change a word on thepiece of paper.''   Trumka said he also requested a ``one-on-one meeting'' withPittston Chief Executive Officer Paul Douglas, ``but he didn't evenhave the courtesy to respond.''   Matthis said his company's latest offer is better than thecontract the UMW recently signed with A.T. Massey Coal Co., ending abitter conflict that began in 1984, and he said he doesn't expecttalks to resume soon.   According to Trumka, before the 1984 contract expired the UMWoffered Pittston a no-strike agreement in exchange for a promisethat the company would sign the contract negotiated between the UMWand the Bituminous Coal Operators Association.   ``When the company refused, the union went a step further andoffered to work under an extension of our existing agreement withPittston until we could reach a satisfactory agreement to bothsides. Again, Pittston dismissed the union's offer out of hand,''Trumka said.   ``In fact, Pittston's actions went far beyond a mere dismissal ofthe union's efforts to negotiate a strike-free agreement. In thedead of winter, management abruptly cut off all health care benefitsto 1,500 UMWA retirees, widows and disabled miners _ people who hadsacrificed the best part of their lives to make Pittston a very,very profitable corporation.''</TEXT></DOC>
