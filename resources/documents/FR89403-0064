(Texaco) under the terms ofa consent order between the DOE and Texaco. In accordance with the provisionsof the procedural regulations at 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V (Subpart V),the ERA requests in its petition that the OHA establish special proceduresto make refunds in order to remedy the effects of alleged regulatory violationswhich were settled by the Texaco consent order.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>Texaco is a major integrated refiner which produced and sold crude oiland a full range of refined petroleum products during the period of federalprice controls. The firm was therefore subject to the Mandatory PetroleumPrice and Allocation Regulations set forth in 10 CFR Parts 210, 211 and212, and predecessor regulations in 6 CFR Part 150. During the course ofcontrols, the ERA conducted an extensive audit of Texaco's operations andalleged in several judicial and administrative proceedings that Texacohas violated certain applicable DOE price and allocation regulations inits sales of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Settlement discussionswere held, and on March 10, 1988, the ERA and Texaco entered into a consentorder (No. RTXE006A1Z) that resolved issues pertaining to Texaco's crudeoil and refined petroleum product operations during the period January1, 1973 through January 27, 1981 (the consent order period).\1\<NOTE/> After the ERA reviewed written comments from the public,and oral testimony at a public hearing, the consent order was finalizedon August 29, 1988. See 53 FR. 32929 (August 29, 1988) (the August 29 Notice).Pursuant to the consent order, Texaco is required to remit a total of $1.25billion \2\<NOTE/> pursuant to the following timetable as specified in the consentorder:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The consent order also resolves certain allegations againstGetty Oil Company, which has been acquired by Texaco. Those allegationsrelate to crude oil exchange between Getty and Standard Oil of Ohio andwere the subject of a Supplemental Remedial Order issued to Getty on July17, 1986. See Notice of Proposed Consent Order, 53 FR. 15106, 15107-08(April 27, 1988); <T3>Getty Oil Co.</T3>, 14 DOE andpara; 83,033 (1986).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ This amount represents Texaco's payment obligation exclusiveof interest. Since the effective date of the consent order, interest hasbeen accruing on the unpaid balance of the consent order amount_currently$850 million_at a rate of 8.85 per cent per annum. Texaco Consent Orderandpara; 404.(a) $52 million within five days of the consent order date(b) $348 million within 30 days of the consent order date(c) $190 million plus accrued interest within 18 months of the consentorder date(d) 4 annual payments of $165 million plus accrued interestAs of the date of the issuance of this Proposed Decision and Order, Texacohas remitted $348 million to the DOE.\3\<NOTE/> These funds and future payments comprising the consent orderfund are and will be held in an interest-bearing escrow account maintainedat the Department of the Treasury pending a determination regarding theirproper distribution through Subpart V.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ In accordance with the terms of the consent order, Texacohas also remitted the initial payment of $52 million to the United StatesDistrict Court of the District of Kansas in settlement of its obligationsin the DOE Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, M.D.L. 378.II. Jurisdictionand AuthorityThe Subpart V regulations set forth general guidelines which may be usedby the OHA in formulating and implementing a plan of distribution of fundsreceived as a result of an enforcement proceeding. The DOE policy is touse the Subpart V process to distribute oil overcharge funds. For a moredetailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of OHA to fashion proceduresto distribute refunds, see <T3>Office of Enforcement, </T3>9 DOE andpara; 82,508 (1981); <T3>Office of Enforcement, </T3>8 DOE andpara; 82,597 (1981)(<T3>Vickers</T3>).We have considered the ERA's petition that we implement a Subpart V proceedingwith respect to the Texaco consent order fund and have determined thatsuch a proceeding is appropriate. This Proposed Decision and Order setsforth the OHA's tentative plan to distribute this fund. Comments are solicited.III. Proposed Refund ProceduresBecause the consent order resolves alleged violations involving both salesof crude oil and refined petroleum products, we propose to divide the consentorder fund into two pools. See <T3>Shell Oil Co., </T3>18 DOE andpara; 85,492 (1989)(<T3>Shell</T3>). According to the ERA, $120,000,000 of the consent orderfund is attributable to refined product issues and the remaining $1,078,000,000is attributable to crude oil and related issues. See August 29 Notice at32931. This allocation was based upon the ERA's assessment of the ``litigationrisks involved in the various crude and refined product cases that haveled to this consent order, the linkage of certain refined product issueswhich could substantially alter dollar liability amounts and the relativelyearly stages of litigation for many of the refined product issues as comparedwith the crude oil pricing issues.'' Id. While the ERA has deferred adjudicationof the final division of the consent order fund to the OHA, we find noreason to alter this division.\4\<NOTE/> Accordingly, we propose that $120 million, plus interestaccrued on that amount, be made available for distribution to purchasersof Texaco refined petroleum products who demonstrate that they were injuredas a result of Texaco's alleged regulatory violations. Additionally, tospeed action in this proceeding, we propose that the principal amount of$120 million be taken in its entirety from the initial payment of $348million made by Texaco to the DOE. We further propose that the remainingportion of the consent order fund, or $228 million from Texaco's initialpayment and all future payments and accumulated interest on both the $228million and those future payments, be set aside as a pool of crude oilovercharge funds available for disbursement. The specific distributionprocedures for those funds are proposed in detail in the following section.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ We have generally relied upon the ERA's divisions of consentorder funds into refined product and crude oil pools when ERA has madea reasonable evaluation of the various strengths and weaknesses of thelitigation issues composing the basis of the consent order. See <T3>Shell Oil Co., </T3>52 FR 47967, 47283 (Proposed Decision and Order),finalized, 18 DOE andpara; 85,492 (1989). In some cases were the ERA hasnot proposed a division of the consent order fund into refined and crudeoil pools, we have used the maximum liability for refined products andcrude oil in order to divide the consent order fund proportionately. See<T3>e.g., Exxon Corp., </T3>52 Fed. Reg. 35313, 35314 (Proposed Decisionand Order), finalized, 17 DOE andpara; 85,590 (1988) (<T3>Exxon</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Crude Oil Claims</ITAG>We propose that the funds in the crude oil pool be distributed in accordancewith the Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy (MSRP), which wasissued by the DOE on July 28, 1986. 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986).\5\<NOTE/> The MSRP, which was issued as a result of a court-approvedSettlement Agreement in <T3>The Department of Energy Stripper Well Litigation, </T3>M.D.L. 378(D. Kan. 1986), provides that crude oil overcharge payments will be distributedamong the States, the United States Treasury, and eligible purchasers ofcrude oil and refined products.\6\<NOTE/> Under the MSRP, up to 20 percent of these crude oil overchargefunds may be reserved to satisfy valid claims by eligible purchasers ofcrude oil and refined petroleum products. Remaining funds are to be disbursedto the state and federal government for indirect restitution as directedby the MSRP. In the present case, we have decided to reserve the full 20percent, or $45.6 million of the $228 million crude oil pool, plus proportionateshare of the accrued interest on that amount, for direct refunds to purchasersof crude oil and refined petroleum products who prove that they were injuredas a result of alleged crude oil violations.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ In the Order implementing the MSRP, the OHA solicitedcomments regarding the proper application of the MSRP to OHA refund proceedingsinvolving alleged crude oil violations. On April 6, 1987, the OHA issueda notice which analyzes the comments that were submitted and explains theprocedures which the Office will follow in processing applications filedunder Subpart V regulations for refunds from the crude oil overcharge funds.52 FR 11737 (Apr. 10, 1987). Since the procedures apply to all crude oilfunds subject to Subpart V, we need not differentiate between the variouscrude oil transactions (including those involving Getty) settled by theTexaco consent order.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Under the Settlement Agreement, firms which apply fora portion of certain escrow funds established under the Settlement generallymust sign a waiver releasing their claims to any crude oil funds to bedistributed by the OHA under Subpart V. Accordingly, those firms will notbe eligible for a refund from the Texaco crude oil pool.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The allocation of monies in the crude oil pool is basedupon the amount of crude oil related funds currently available in the Texacoconsent order fund. When additional payments are received from Texaco,they will be added to the crude oil pool and 20 percent of each paymentwill be reserved for direct claimants.The process which the OHA will use to evaluate claims based on allegedcrude oil violations will be modeled after the process the OHA has usedin Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based upon alleged overchargesinvolving refined products.<T3> See Mountain Fuel Supply Co.,</T3> 14 DOE andpara; 85,475 (1986).As in non-crude oil cases, applicants will be required to document theirpurchase volumes and prove that they were injured as a result of allegedviolations (i.e., that they did not pass on the alleged overcharges totheir customers). We propose to utilize standards for the showing of injurywhich OHA has developed for analyzing non-crude oil claims. See, e.g.,<T3> Dorchester Gas Corp.,</T3> 14 DOE andpara; 85,240 (1986). These standardsinclude a presumption that end-users (i.e., ultimate consumers) whose businessesare unrelated to the petroleum industry absorbed the increased costs resultingfrom a consent order firm's alleged overcharges. See<T3> A. Tarricone, Inc.,</T3> 15 DOE andpara; 85,495 at 88,894-896 (1987).However, reseller and retailer claimants must submit detailed evidenceof injury, and may not rely upon the presumptions of injury utilized inrefund cases involving refined petroleum products.<T3> Id.</T3> They can, however, use econometric evidence of the type employedin the OHA Report in<T3> In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>6 Fed. Energy Guidelines andpara; 90,507.Refunds to eligible claimants will be calculated on the basis of a volumetricrefund amount derived by dividing the 20 percent of the crude oil poolcurrently available which is reserved for crude oil claimants ($45.6 million)by the total consumption of petroleum products in the United States duringthe period of price controls (2,020,997,335,000 gallons). Based upon theamount of the crude oil pool currently available, the crude oil volumetricrefund amount in this proceeding is $0.000022563 per gallon. This volumetricrefund amount will increase as interest accrues on the consent order fundand as subsequent payments are made by Texaco. After all valid claims arepaid, unclaimed funds from the 20 percent claims reserve will be dividedequally between federal and state governments. The federal government'sshare of the unclaimed funds will ultimately be deposited into the generalfund of the Treasury of the United States.We propose that the remaining 80 percent of the currently available crudeoil pool ($182.4 million) and 80 percent of accumulated interest and futurepayments made by Texaco be disbursed in equal shares to the federal andstate governments for indirect restitution. See<T3> Shell.</T3> If this proposal is adopted, we will direct the DOE'sOffice of the Controller to segregate the crude oil share of Texaco's initialpayment and distribute $91.2 million, plus appropriate interest, to theStates and the same amount to the federal government. Refunds to the Stateswill be in proportion to the consumption of petroleum products in eachstate during the period of price controls. The share (ratio) of the fundsin the account which each State will receive if these procedures are adoptedis contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement. Thesefunds will be subject to the same limitations and reporting requirementsas all other crude oil monies received by the States under the SettlementAgreement.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Refined Product Claims</ITAG>The remainder of the Texaco consent order fund ($120 million plus interestaccrued on that amount) shall be made available to injured purchasers ofTexaco refined products. We propose to implement a two-stage refund processby which purchasers of Texaco refined products during the consent orderperiod may submit Applications for Refund in this initial stage.\8\<NOTE/> From our experience with Subpart V proceedings, we expectthat potential applicants generally will fall into the following categories:(i) End-users; (ii) regulated entities, such as public utilities, and cooperatives;and (iii) refiners, resellers and retailers (hereinafter collectively referredto as ``resellers'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ OHA will not accept Applications for Refund on behalfof classes of applicants. We have previously determined that such claimsare inappropriate in the ``first stage'' claims process in which we reviewclaims of direct injury, because they amount to a proposal for ``indirect''restitution, i.e., specifically identified by the DOE. See<T3> Standard Oil Co. (Indiana)/Diesel Automotive Association,</T3> 11DOE andpara; 85,250 (1984);<T3> Office of Special Counsel,</T3> 10 DOE andpara; 85,048 at 88,214 (1982).In order to receive a refund, each claimant will be required to submita schedule of its purchases of Texaco refined petroleum products duringthe consent order period.<T3> See</T3> ``Proposed Application Procedures,'' infra. If the productwas not directly purchased from Texaco, the claimant must establish thatthe product originated with Texaco.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Although Texaco now owns Getty Oil, purchases made fromGetty are not eligible for refunds in this proceeding. Firms which purchasedrefined products from Getty were generally eligible for refunds in a separateSubpart V proceeding involving a Getty consent order. See<T3> Getty Oil Co.,</T3> 15 DOE andpara; 85,064 (1986). The consent orderunderlying the Getty Subpart V proceeding excluded issues relating to thepropriety of costs reported by Getty for interaffiliate transfers of naturalgas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas liquid products and the computationof shrinkage costs of NGLs associated with the production of refined petroleumproducts. These issues, however, were settled by a later Getty consentorder which remitted the funds to the DOE for deposit directly into theU.S. Treasury. Thus, these funds were not made available for direct restitutionunder Subpart v. See Notice of Proposed Consent Order, Getty Oil Co., 47FR 20347 (May 12, 1982).In addition, a reseller claimant, except one who chooses to utilize theinjury presumptions set forth below, will be required to make a detailedshowing that it was injured by Texaco's alleged overcharges. This showingwill generally consist of two distinct elements. First, a reseller claimantwill be required to show that it had ``banks'' of unrecouped increasedproduct costs in excess of the refund claimed.\10\<NOTE/> Second, because a showing of banked costs alone is not sufficientto establish injury, a claimant must provide evidence that market conditionsprecluded it from increasing its prices to pass through the additionalcosts associated with the alleged overcharges. See <T3>Vickers Energy Corp./Hutchens Oil Co., </T3>11 DOE andpara; 85,070 at88,105 (1983). Such a showing could consist of a demonstration that a firmsuffered a competitive disadvantage as a result of its purchases from Texaco.See <T3>National Helium Co./Atlantic Richfield Co., </T3>11 DOE andpara; 85,257(1984), <T3>aff'd sub nom. Atlantic Richfield Co. </T3>v. <T3>DOE, </T3>618 F. Supp. 1199 (D. Del. 1985).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Claimants who have previously relied upon their bankedcosts in order to obtain refunds in other special refund proceedings shouldsubtract those refunds from the cumulative banked costs submitted in thisproceeding. See <T3>Husky Oil Co./Metro Oil Products, Inc., </T3>16 DOE andpara; 85,090 at88,179 (1987). Additionally, a claimant may not receive a refund for anymonth in which it has a negative cumulative bank (for that product) orfor any preceding month. See <T3>Standard Oil (Indiana)/Suburban Propane Gas Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara;85,030 at 88,082 (1985). If a claimant no longer has records showing itsbanked costs, the OHA may use its discretion to allow approximations ofthose banks prepared by the applicant. See <T3>e.g., Gulf Oil Corp./Sturdy Oil Co., </T3>15 DOE andpara; 85,187 (1986).1. <T3>Presumptions for Claims Based upon Refined Product Purchases. </T3>Ourexperience also indicates that the use of certain presumptions permitsclaimants to participate in the refund process without incurring inordinateexpense and ensures that refund claims are evaluated in the most efficientmanner possible. See, <T3>e.g., Marathon Petroleum Co., </T3>14 DOE andpara; 85,269 (1986) (<T3>Marathon</T3>). Presumptions in refund cases are specifically authorizedby the applicable DOE procedural regulations at 10 CFR 205.282(e). Accordingly,we propose to adopt the presumptions set forth below.First, we will adopt a presumption that the alleged overcharges were dispersedequally in all of Texaco's sales of refined petroleum products during theconsent order period. In accordance with this presumption, refunds aremade on a pro-rata or volumetric basis.\11\<NOTE/> In the absence of better information, a volumetric refundis appropriate because the DOE price regulations generally required a regulatedfirm to account for increased costs on a firm-wide basis in determiningits prices.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Because we realize that the impact on an individual claimantmay have been greater than the volumetric refund amount, we will allowany purchaser to file a refund application based upon a claim that it suffereda disproportionate share of Texaco's alleged overcharges. See <T3>e.g., Standard Oil Co. (Indiana/Army) and Air Force Exchange Service,</T3>12 DOE andpara; 85,015 (1984).Under the volumetric approach, a claimant's ``allocable share'' of therefined product pool is equal to the number of gallons purchased from theconsent order firm during the applicable consent order period times theper gallon refund amount. In the present case, the per gallon refund amountis $0.001136. We derived this figure by dividing the conset order fundsin the refined product pool ($120 million) by 105,590,045,356 gallons,the approximate number of gallons of covered products other than crudeoil which Texaco sold from March 6, 1973, the date that Texaco became subjectto the Federal price controls under Special Rule No. 1 (38 Fed. Reg. 6283)(March 8, 1973), through the date of decontrol of the relevant product.\12\<NOTE/> A firm that establishes its entitlement to a refund willreceive all or a portion of its allocable share plus a pro-rata share ofthe accured interest.\13\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Although the Texaco consent order period begins January1, 1973, refund applications may only be based upon purchases of refinedproducts between March 6, 1973 and the relevant decontrol date for eachproduct as summarized below:<ITAG tagnum="28">Ethane and Liquid Asphalt_April 1, 1974</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Residual Fuel_June 1, 1976</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">No. 1 and No. 2 Heating Oil; Diesel Fuel and Kerosene_July 1, 1976</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Naphthas_September 1, 1976</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Naphtha Based Jet Fuel_October 1, 1976</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Aviation Gas and Kerosene; Based Jet Fuel_February 26, 1979</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Butane and Natural Gasoline_January 1, 1980</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Motor Gasoline and Propane_January 28, 1981</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ As in previous cases, we propose to establish a minimumrefund amount of $15.00. We have found through our experience that thecost of processing claims in which refunds for amounts less than $15.00are sought outweighs the benefits of restitution in those instances. See<T3>Exxon </T3>at 89,150.<ITAG tagnum="54">In addition to the volumetric presumption, we also propose to adopta number of presumptions regarding injury for claimants in each categorylisted below.</ITAG>a. <T3>End-users. </T3>In accordance with prior Subpart V proceedings, wepropose to adopt the presumption that an end-user or ultimate consumerof Texaco petroleum products whose business is unrelated to the petroleumindustry was injured by the alleged overcharges settled by the consentorder. See e.g., <T3>Texas Oil and Gas Corp.,</T3> 12 DOE andpara; 85,069 at 88,209 (1984)(<T3>TOGCO</T3>). Unlike regulated firms in the petroleum industry, membersof this group generally were not subject to price controls during the consentorder period, and were not required to keep records which justified sellingprice increases by reference to cost increases. Consequently, analysisof the impact of the alleged overcharges on the final prices of goods andservices produced by members of this group would be beyond the scope ofthe refund proceeding. <T3>Id. </T3>We therefore propose that the end-users of Texaco refinedpetroleum products need only document their purchase volumes from Texacoduring the consent order period to make a sufficient showing that theywere injured by the alleged overcharges.b. <T3>Refiners, Resellers, and Retailers Seeking Refunds of $10,000 or Less.</T3>We propose to adopt a presumption that a firm which resold Texacoproducts and requests a small refund was injured by the alleged regulatoryviolations. Under the small claims presumption, a reseller seeking a smallrefund will not be required to submit evidence of injury beyond documentationof the volume of Texaco covered products it purchased during the consentorder period. See TOGCO at 88,210. As we have noted in numerous prior proceedings,there may be considerable expense involved in gathering the types of datanecessary to support a detailed claim of injury; in some cases, the expensemight possibly exceed the expected refund. Consequently, failure to allowsimplified application procedures for small claims could therefore depriveinjured parties of their opportunity to obtain a refund. Furthermore, useof the small claim presumption is desirable in that it allows the OHA toprocess the large number of routine refund claims expected in an efficientmanner.In many prior cases, we have established a small claims threshold of $5,000.In the present case, however, in order to minimize the burden upon individualapplicants and this Office, we have tentatively decided to establish thesmall claims threshold at $10,000. This determination is based on a numberof considerations. In this proceeding, the volumetric factor is significantlyhigher than the amount in most other proceedings; in fact, in is doublethe average volumetric refund amount available in the seven most recentSubpart V proceedings involving global consent orders with major integratedoil companies. As a result, the allocable share of many small retailersand resellers who would typically qualify for a refund at or below thesmall claims threshold will be well above $5,000 in this case. If we wereto keep the small claims threshold at $5,000 in this case, it would significantlyincrease the number of firms, especially very small firms, that would befaced with the burden of making a detailed showing of injury in order toreceive their allocable share. It would also very significantly increasethe burden on this Office because of the need to analyze many more detailedinjury showings and would thus slow down the evaluation of claims. Therefore,in order to minimize these burdens we are proposing a larger small claimsthreshold of $10,000.\14\<NOTE/> Reseller claimants whose allocable share is $10,000 or lesswill be presumed injured and therefore need not provide a further demonstrationof injury to receive their full allocable share.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ Resellers that purchased less than 8,803,000 gallonsof Texaco refined products during the consent order period will be eligibleto use this presumption. This gallonage is just slightly more than theaverage gallonage necessary to obtain a refund at the small claims thresholdin the Mobil, Marathon, Getty, Gulf II, Atlantic Richfield, Exxon and Shellrefund proceedings (8,335,278 gallons).c. <T3>Medium-Range Refiner, Reseller and Retailer Claimants. </T3>In lieuof making a detailed showing of injury, a reseller claimant whose allocableshare exceeds $10,000 may elect to receive as its refund the larger of$10,000 or 40 percent of its allocable share up to $50,000.\15\<NOTE/> The use of this presumption reflects our conviction thatthese larger claimants were likely to have experienced some injury as aresult of the alleged overcharges. See <T3>Marathon, </T3>14 DOE at 88,515. In some prior special refund proceedings,we have performed detailed economic analysis in order to determine product-specificlevels of injury. See, e.g., <T3>Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985). However, in <T3>Gulf Oil Corp., </T3>16 DOE andpara; 85,381 at 88,737 (1987), we determinedthat based upon the available data, it was more accurate and efficientto adopt a single presumptive level of injury of 40 percent for all medium-rangeclaimants, regardless of the refined product that they purchased, basedupon the results of our analyses in prior proceedings. We believe thatapproach generally to be sound, and we therefore propose to adopt a 40percent presumptive level of injury for all medium-range claimants in thisproceedings. Consequently, an applicant in this group will only be requiredto provide documentation of its purchase volumes of Texaco refined petroleumproducts during the consent order period in order to be eligible to receivea refund of 40 percent of its total volumetric share, or $10,000, whicheveris greater.\16\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ That is, claimants who purchased between 8,803,000 gallonsand 110,035,211 gallons of Texaco refined petroleum products during theconsent order period (medium-range claimants) may elect to utilize thispresumption. Claimants who purchased more than 110,035,211 gallons mayelect to limit their claim to $50,000.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ A claimants who attempts to make a detailed showing ofinjury in order to obtain 100 percent of its allocable share but, instead,provides evidence that leads us to conclude that it passed through allof the alleged overcharges or is eligible for a refund of less than theapplicable presumption-level refund will not then be eligible for a presumption-basedrefund. Instead, such a claimant will receive a refund which reflects thelevel of injury established in its Application. No refund will be approvedif its submission indicates that it was not injured as a result of itspurchases from Texaco. <T3>See Exxon, </T3>17 DOE at 89,150 n.10; <T3>Quaker State Oil Refining Corp./Campbell Oil Co., </T3>15 DOE andpara;85,089 (1986).d. <T3>Regulated Firms and Cooperatives. </T3>We further propose that, inorder to receive a full volumetric refund, a claimant whose prices forgoods and services are regulated by a governmental agency, e.g., a publicutility, or by terms of a cooperative agreement, needs only to submit documentationof purchases used by itself or, in the case of a cooperative, sold to itsmembers. However, a regulated firm or a cooperative whose allocable shareis greater than $10,000 will also be required to certify that it will passany refund received through to its customers or member-customers, provideus with a full explanation of how it plans to accomplish the restitution,and certify that it will notify the appropriate regulatory body or membershipgroup of the receipt of the refund. This requirement is based upon thepresumption that, with respect to a regulated firm, any overcharges wouldhave been routinely passed through to its customers. Similarly, any refundsreceived would be passed through to its customers. With respect to a cooperative,in general, the cooperative agreements which control prices would ensurethat the alleged overcharges, and similarly refunds, would be passed throughto its member-customers. Accordingly, these firms will not be requiredto make a detailed demonstration of injury.\1\\7\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ A cooperative's purchases of Texaco products whichwere resold to non-members will be treated in a manner consistent withpurchases made by other resellers. See Marathon, 14 DOE at 88,515.e. <T3>Spot Purchasers. </T3>We propose to adopt a rebuttable presumptionthat a reseller that made only spot purchases from Texaco did not sufferinjury as a result of those purchases. As we have previously stated, spotpurchasers generally had considerable discretion as to the timing and marketin which they made their purchases, and therefore would not have made spotmarket purchases from a firm at increased prices unless they were ableto pass through the full amount of the firm's selling price to their owncustomers. See Vickers 8 DOE at 85,396-97. Accordingly, a spot purchaserclaimant must submit specific and detailed evidence to rebut the spot purchaserspresumption and to establish the extent to which it was injured as a resultof its spot purchases from Texaco.\1\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ In prior proceedings we have stated that refunds willbe approved for spot purchasers who demonstrate that (i) they made thespot purchases for the purpose of ensuring a supply for their base periodcustomers rather than in anticipation of financial advantage as a resultof those purchases, and (ii) they were forced by market conditions to resellthe product at a loss that was not subsequentially recouped through thedraw down of banks. <T3>See Quaker State Oil Refining Corp./Certified Gasoline Co., </T3>14DOE andpara; 85,465 (1986). f. <T3>Consignee. </T3> A consignee agent is a firm that distributed coveredproducts pursuant to a contractual agreement with a refiner, under whichthe refiner retained title to the products, specified the price to be paidby the purchaser, and paid the consignee a commission based upon the volumeof covered products it distributed. 10 CFR 212.31 (definition of ``Consigneeagent''). As in many previous cases, we propose to adopt the rebuttablepresemption that consignees of Texaco refined petroleum products were notinjured as a result of their arrangement with their refiner/supplier. Seee.g., <T3>Exxon</T3> 17 DOE at 89,151. A consignee, however, may rebut this presumptionof non-injury by establishing that ``[its] sales volumes, and [its] correspondingcommission revenues, declined due to the alleged uncompetitiveness of [theconsent order firm's] practices. See <T3>Gulf Oil Corp./C.F. Canter Oil Co., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85.388 at 88,962(1986). 2. <T3>Allocation Claims. </T3>We may also receive claims based upon Texaco'salleged failure to furnish petroleum products that it was obliged to supplyunder the DOE allocation regulations that became effective in Januay 1974.See 10 CFR Part 211. Any such applications will be evaluated with referenceto the standards set forth in Subpart V implementation cases such as <T3>Office of Special Counsel, </T3> 10 DOE andpara; 85,048 at 88,220 (1982),and refund application cases such as <T3>OKC Corp./Town andamp; Country Markets, Inc.,</T3> 12 DOE andpara; 85,094(1984); <T3>Marathon Petroleum Co./Research Fuels, Inc., </T3>Case No. FR250-2695(April 29, 1988) (Proposed Decision). These standards generally requirean allocation claimant to demonstrate the existence of a supplier/purchaserrelationship with the consent order firm and the likelihood that the consentorder firm failed to furnish petroleum products that it was obliged tosupply to the claimant under 10 CFR Part 211. In addition, the claimantshould provide evidence that it had contemporaneously notified the DOEor otherwise sought redress from the alleged allocation violation. Finally,the claimant must establish that it was injured and document the extentof the injury. 3. <T3>Proposed Application Procedures. </T3>We propose to accept applicationsfrom claimants who purchased Texaco refined products between March 6, 1973and January 27, 1981. <T3>At this time, we will not accept Applications for Refund. </T3>Alsoas in prior refund proceedings, we do not at this time propose to requirea specific application form. However, all applications will be requiredto contain certain information specified in a suggested format that willbe appended to the final Decision and Order implementing refund proceduresin the Texaco proceeding. At the minimum, this information will consistof the following items:  (1) A conspicuous reference to ``Texaco Refund Proceeding_Case No. KEF_0119''and the name and address of the applicant during the period for which theclaim is filed, as well as the name to whom the refund check should bemade out and the address to which the check should be sent. If the checkis to be sent to a party other than the applicant, the applicant shallalso provide its current address. (2) The name, title, and telephone number of a person who may be contractedfor additional information concerning the Application. (3) The manner in which the applicant used the Texaco product, e.g., whetherthe applicant was a refiner, petroleum jobber, gas station, end-user orconsumer, consignee agent, public utility, or cooperative.\1\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ Retailer applicants must file a separate form (withsupporting schedule of purchases) for each retail station for which a refundis requested. (4) If the applicant was supplied directly by Texaco, it must provide itsTexaco customer number. If the applicant was an indirect purchaser, itmust submit the name and address of its immediate supplier and indicatewhy it believes that the covered product was originally sold by Texaco.(5) A statement that neither it nor a related firm has filed, or authorizedany individual to file on its behalf, any other refund application in theTexaco proceeding. This statement must be signed by the applicant and maynot be signed by its representative (outside counsel, filing service, etc.).\2\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ If duplicate Applications containing this statementare filed, both Applications may be summarily denied or dismissed. See<T3>Exxon Corp./William H. Abbott, </T3>18 DOE andpara; 85,406 (1988); <T3>Getty Oil Co./Dale Gas andamp; Oil Co., </T3>18 DOE andpara; 85,376 (1988).(6) If the applicant is or was entirely or partly owned by Texaco, it mustexplain the nature of the affiliation.\2\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ We have previously held that affiliates or subsidiariesof a consent order firm are not eligible for refunds based upon the presumptionthat they were not injured. See, e.g., <T3>Marathon Petroleum Co./EMRO Propane Co., </T3>15 DOE andSection; 85,288at 85,528 (1987). This presumption applies to firms affiliated with Texacoduring the consent order period but no longer affiliated with the firm.See <T3>Cosby Oil Co./Yucca Valley Liquor Store, </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,402at 88,986 (1986). It also applies to firms that have become affiliatedwith Texaco after the consent order period, because their receipt of arefund would allow the consent order firm to benefit from this proceeding.See, e.g., <T3>Marathon Petroleum Co./Webster Service Stations, </T3>17 DOE andpara;85,038 (1988). For a partial list of Texaco affiliates, that we proposeto find ineligible under this presumption, see the Appendix to this ProposedDecision and Order. (7) If the applicant has been involved in an enforcement proceeding broughtby the DOE or a private action under Section 210 of the Economic StablilizationAct of 1970, it should describe the action and its current status. If theapplicant was a party to any such action which is no longer pending, itshould indicate how the proceeding was resolved. The applicant must keepthe OHA informed of any change in status of the proceeding during the pendencyof its Application for Refund. For a more detailed explanation of the considerationsinvolved in our evaluating responses to this item, see <T3>Office of Enforcement, </T3>9 DOE andpara; 82,508 at 85,052-4 (1981).(8) The applicant must state whether the ownership of its business haschanged during or since the refund period. If ownership has changed, itshould indicate when and provide this Office with the names and addressesof the other parties included in that transaction.\2\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ The OHA has held that the party that actually purchasedthe products from a consent order firm was in all likelihood the partyinjured by any alleged overcharges. Therefore, this party is generallythe proper recipient of the Subpart V refund, absent a demonstration thatthe right to a refund has been transferred to the present owner. See, e.g.,<T3>Gulf Oil Corp./Strubes Propane, Inc., </T3>16 DOE andpara; 85,314 (1987).(9) The Application should also contain the following statement signedby the individual applicant or a responsible official of a corporate orother organizational applicant: ``I swear (or affirm) that the informationcontained in this application and its attachments is true and correct tothe best of my knowledge and belief. I understand that anyone who is convictedof providing false information to the federal government may be subjectto a fine, a jail sentence, or both, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001. I understandthat the information contained in this application is subject to publicdisclosure. I have enclosed a duplicate of this entire application whichwill be placed in the OHA Public Reference Room.'' \2\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ An applicant may request that confidential informationbe withhold from disclosure, but the OHA retains the right to make itsown determination with regard to any claim of confidentiality. See 10 CFR205.9(f)(2). In view of the length of time that has elapsed since the Texacoconsent order period, it may be difficult for an applicant to establishthat the information that it submits is exempt from public disclosure underthe Freedom of Information Act. See <T3>Vinson andamp; Elkins, </T3>9 DOE andpara; 80,150 (1982).Applications based on alleged overcharges will also have to include thefollowing information:(1) Monthly schedules of the applicant's purchases of each refined petroleumproduct that it purchased from Texaco from March 6, 1973 through the dateof decontrol of that product. Yearly schedules will only be accepted ifthey are accompanied by a Texaco-generated printout or adequate supportingdocumentation from the firm's own records. Estimated volumes will onlybe accepted if they are reasonable and if the applicant (a) certifies thatactual records are unavailable, (b) indicates the source of the informationupon which the Application is based and (c) clearly explains how the estimatesare derived.(2) If the applicant is a refiner, reseller, or retailer whose allocableshare exceeds $10,000, it must indicate whether it elects to receive asits refund the larger of $10,000 or 40 percent of its allocable share upto $50,000. If it does not elect to receive a presumption refund, it mustsubmit a detailed showing that is was injured by the alleged overcharges.See Part IIIB, supra. We solicit comments on these proposed Application procedures for the distributionof the refined products portion of the consent order fund.IV. Filing ServicesIn addition to the general procedures outlined above, the OHA proposesother procedures due to the proliferation of firms seeking to representpotential claimants in Subpart V proceedings. In some Subpart V proceedings,filing services have provided a useful service by informing many potentialapplicants about the Subpart V process and preparing refund claims on theirbehalf. However, some filing services have increasingly become engagedin questionable solicitation practices and have committed many unnecessaryerrors. Those actions, usually caused by negligence or overzealous solicitationpractices, have delayed the evaluation of refund claims and have necessitatedthe Office's use of increased resources to screen and process incomplete,unauthorized or duplicate Applications for Refund. In many cases, theseerrors occur because a filing service does not submit all of the informationrequired by the OHA in each Application or has prepared the Applicationwell in advance of any notice from OHA regarding the proper applicationprocedures in the proceeding. Other problems have occurred because serviceshave adopted inadequate procedures to obtain authorization from applicantsand because they have not been knowledgeable regarding the procedural andsubstantive requirements for refund applications. These problems have ledus to consider taking corrective actions in other proceedings.\24\<NOTE/> Based upon the continued problems caused by these servicesin recent proceedings, we propose the following actions in an attempt tolimit possible abuses by such firms:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ In a recent case, because of our lack of confidence inthe integrity of a filing service, Federal Refunds, Inc., we determinedthat it was appropriate to disburse refunds directly to the firms thatit purported to represent. See <T3>Ken's Professional Waterproofing,</T3> 18 DOE andpara;  , Case No. RF272-65929(March 15, 1989). See also <T3>Illinois Gasoline Dealers Association, </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,114 (1985)(Dealers' association suspended for filing fraudulent refund applications);<T3>Herbert L. Tanner,</T3> 18 DOE andpara; 85,105 (1988) (Order to ShowCause issued to a filing service, P.A.D., Inc., and its President, dueto repeated errors); <T3>Lafayette andamp; Greenville Bus Owner's Association,</T3> 18 DOE andpara;85,137 (1988) (president of a filing service, Petroleum Resources Associates,Inc., warned that false statements in future submissions may result inthe suspension of his privilege to participate in refund proceedings);<T3>Ozona Gas Processing I/Ozona Butane Co.,</T3> 15 DOE andpara; 85,161(1986) (president of a filing service, Energy Refunds, Inc., warned thatfailure to verify statements of clients may result in suspension of hisprivilege to participate in refund proceedings).(i) Submission by the filing service of a statement indicating the firm'squalifications to represent applicants and containing a detailed descriptionof the solicitation practices and application procedures that it plansto use. This statement must be approved by OHA prior to the approval ofany applications filed by the firm. This statement should include the followinginformation:(a) A description of the procedures used to solicit clients and copiesof any solicitation materials mailed to prospective clients;(b) A description of how the firm obtains authorization from its clientsto file a refund application, including copies of any type of authorizationform signed by clients;(c) A copy of the standard fee agreement that the firm enters into withclients;(d) A description of how the firm obtains and verifies the informationcontained in refund applications;(e) A description of the procedures the firm uses to forward refunds toits clients;(f) A description of the procedures the firm uses to avoid duplicate filings;(g) A statement that the firm will not file any refund application forwhich it does not have written authorization from the applicant.(ii) Strict compliance with the filing requirements as specified in 10CFR 205.283, particularly the requirement that applications and certificationbe signed by ``the applicant.''(iii) The posting of a bond, in an amount to be specified, by all firmsor individuals who plan to file Applications in the Texaco refund proceedingon behalf of another party where the total allocable share of their clientsis greater than $50,000.\25\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ Alternatively, we may require such filing services toplace a sufficient amount of funds in an escrow account in order to protecttheir clients from any impropriety. In other proceedings before this Office,we have conditioned the granting of the requested relief upon the petitioner'sestablishing an irrevocable escrow with the bank. See e.g., <T3>Basset Oil andamp; Equipment Co., </T3>5 FEA andpara; 85,032 (1977); <T3>Boyd Oil Corp., </T3>5 FEA andpara; 85,032 (1977); <T3>General Crude Oil Co., </T3>3 FEA andpara; 85,040 (1976).(iv) A certification, dated after the issuance of the Texaco Final Decisionand Order, signed by each applicant whose authorization of a filing serviceor Application for Refund has been signed and dated before the issuanceof that final Decision, that it has not filed any other Application forRefund in the Texaco refund proceeding and that it still authorizes thatfiling service or attorney to represent it.We solicit comments on the above proposals and request alternative suggestions.V. Distribution of Product Funds Remaining after First StageWe propose that any refined product funds that remain after all first stageclaims have been decided be distributed in accordance with the provisionsof the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA),15 U.S.C. 4501-07. PODRA requires that the Secretary of Energy determineannually the amount of oil overcharge funds that will not be required torefund monies to injuried parties in Subpart V proceedings and make thosefinds available to state governments for use in four energy conservationprograms. The Secretary has delegated these responsibilities to the OHA,and any refined product pool funds in the Texaco consent order escrow accountthat the OHA determines will not be needed to effect direct restitutionto injured Texaco customers will be distributed in accordance with theprovisions of PODRA.VI. Solicitation of CommentsAs indicated above, no refund applications should be filed at the presenttime. Before disposing of any of the funds received as a result of theTexaco consent order, we intend to publicize the distribution process inorder to solicit comments on all aspects of the foregoing Proposed Decisionand Order from interested parties. All comments must be filed within 30days of the publication of this Proposed Decision in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>The OHA proposes to hold a hearing on this Proposed Decision if sufficientinterest is expressed on any of these matters. The date, location and subjectof such a hearing may be suggested by interested parties in their comments.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>It Is Therefore Ordered, </T3>That:</ITAG>The payments remitted to the Department of Energy by Texaco, Inc. pursuantto Consent Order No. RTXE006A1Z, finalized on August 29, 1988, will bedistributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.<ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Texaco Affiliates and Subsidiaries Presumptively Ineligible</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Aero Oil</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Arbuckle Pipeline Co.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Badger Pipeline</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Bay Drilling Corp.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Clay Oil Terminal</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Colonial Pipeline</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Donna Oil</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Explorer Pipeline</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Gasway, Inc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Getty Oil Co.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">The Harrison, Ltd.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Huelva Pyrites, Inc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Iricon Agency, Ltd.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">KAW Pipeline Co.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Kingston Oil</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Kwik Farms, Inc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Levemilts Petroleum, Inc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Loop, Inc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Minnehoma Cotton Inc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Minnehoma Land and Farming Co.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Nuclear Fuel Services</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Olympic Pipeline Co.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Osage Pipeline Co.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">P.T.
