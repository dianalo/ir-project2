Robert Beevers, undergoing cross-examination by the defense,said the ships he sailed on often had a crew of 32 people, but bythe time he quit in 1987, companies were scaling it down because ofeconomics.   The Exxon Valdez, he said, had 19 crew members. ``That wascertainly the smallest crew on a tanker that I've seen.''   Asked how the crew configuration affected the ship's journey,Beevers said, that with a short crew ``there's more stress. There'smore problems.''   The prosecution witness was questioned in depth about testimonyhe gave Tuesday against Joseph Hazelwood. His answers underquestioning by Hazelwood lawyer Dick Madson were more conciliatorythan they had been under prosecution inquiry.   But he continued to maintain that Hazelwood erred when he leftthe ship's bridge during a tricky maneuver. On Tuesday, he hadcalled Hazelwood reckless and guilty of bad judgment and said hisactions risked his ship and his crew.   ``The master should be on the bridge,'' he said.``Traditionally, that is his duty.''   Jurors in the Hazelwood trial were warned to avoid news reportswhile defense lawyers worried that word of a federal indictment ofExxon Corp. might prejudice the skipper's trial.   Hazelwood lawyer Michael Chalos criticized the timing ofTuesday's indictment of Exxon and its subsidiary, Exxon ShippingCo., on two felony charges and three misdemeanors stemming from thenation's largest oil spill.   ``I'm wondering if there isn't a bigger political force at workhere. They've waited 11 months. Why, as we're finishing the trial,are they putting out press releases and an indictment?'' Chalossaid. ``There's a lot more here than meets the eye.''   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone warned jurors that if theycould not avoid news reports he had the power to sequester them ina hotel, although he added that step wasn't necessary yet.   ``Any information concerning the oil spill is off limits,''Johnstone said.   The defense indicated no plans to seek a mistrial. Chalos said,``A mistrial at this point would only help the state because wefeel it's going very well for captain Hazelwood.''   Until now, Hazelwood, 43, had been the only defendant chargedcriminally in the tanker grounding. He is charged with a felony,criminal mischief, and three misdemeanors: reckless endangerment,operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge ofoil. If convicted, he could get 7\ years in prison and $61,000 infines.   The 987-foot Exxon Valdez spewed nearly 11 million gallons ofAlaska crude oil into the clear waters of Prince William Sound onMarch 24, killing countless birds, fish and other wildlife andtarring beaches for hundreds of miles.   The Exxon indictment accuses the company of employing crewmembers ``knowing such persons to be physically and mentallyincapable of performing the duties assigned to them.''   It mentions that the skipper left the ship's bridge in the handsof an uncertified third mate and ``a helmsman who was known byExxon Shipping Company to be incompetent at performing his assignedduties.''   The latter was a reference to Robert Kagan, the helmsman who hasbeen blamed by witnesses for failing to steer the ship properly. Heremains an employee of Exxon. Hazelwood was fired shortly after theaccident.   Of Hazelwood, witness Beevers said, ``He created the risk ofgrounding, of losing the vessel, of fire, explosion and death tohis crew and of pollution that occurred.''   He accused Hazelwood of trying to drive his stranded ship off ajagged reef in Prince William Sound without taking necessary teststo determine its stability. He said Hazelwood risked sinking orcapsizing the ship.   ``I feel that he used very poor judgment in his actionsbasically from the time they grounded to well after the engineswere stopped,'' Beevers said.   Beevers said he is being paid $35,000 for his services inhelping prosecutors prepare their case against Hazelwood. He worked14 years as a tanker captain and retired from the merchant marinein 1987.   Hazelwood lawyer Dick Madson asked, ``Mr. Beevers, you're notperfect, are you?''   ``No, I'm not,'' said Beevers, who acknowledged he sometimes hadused bad judgment.   ``And have you ever had someone hired to say you exercised badjudgment?'' asked Madson.   ``No,'' said the witness.   Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole said he would rest hiscase by week's end.</TEXT></DOC>
