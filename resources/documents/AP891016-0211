She's starring in ``The Secret Rapture,'' a new play by Britishplaywright David Hare, her boyfriend. The drama was writtenspecifically for Brown _ ``For Blair, as ever,'' says Hare'sdedication _ and she plays one of its three choice female roles.   It tells of two sisters (Brown and Frances Conroy) who returnhome after the death of their father and who must deal with theirlives as well as the life of their alcoholic stepmother (Mary BethHurt). Marion, played by Conroy, is an ambitious junior minister inthe Thatcher government, and Isobel, the role played by Brown, isan ineffectual but well-intentioned graphic designer.   ``The Secret Rapture'' was a big hit at England's NationalTheatre where it was performed by a different cast and with adifferent director. Hare does the honors here.   ``What's hard for some people about David's plays is that theyare not manuals about how to live,'' Brown says. ``Everyone inthem, not unlike life, is a mixture of good and bad, strengths andweaknesses. And that's sometimes difficult for mass Americanaudiences to accept.''   She's confident that New York theatergoers won't have troublerelating to very English characters and will have an easier timepicking up on the family drama than the British politics.   ``So many of the characters sound very American, like Marion,who is a real achiever, or her husband Tom, a Christianbusinessman,'' Brown says. ``I thought the United States had thecorner on that profession and that they were all Southern.''   Whether ``The Secret Rapture'' will succeed on Broadway, Browndoesn't know, but she has an affection for the character she plays.   ``Isobel is a woman sensitive to a certain kind of emotionalblackmail, probably a person who's living her life according to thepath of least resistance,'' the actress says. ``She is not avictim. She hangs on to her own integrity but, to a fault, Isobelis a good daughter.''   Not unlike the slightly bewildered woman Brown plays on thetelevision series ``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,'' now seenon Lifetime, a cable channel.   ``Molly Dodd's'' history is worthy of soap opera, if not sitcom.   It began more than two years ago with producer Jay Tarses, forwhom Brown had done a television pilot that ABC decided not to pickup. They had gotten along immediately.   ``We had the same sense of humor _ he was so twisted,'' Brownlaughs.   ``Then Brandon Tarikoff of NBC called Jay and, without evermentioning the `Mary' word, said he wanted to do a series about asingle woman in the big city,'' she recalls.   What Tarses came up with was ``Molly Dodd,'' which premiered onNBC during the summer of 1987. Despite cheers from the critics, itnever lived up to the network's expectations. What NBC got was anunusual comedy in which Molly struggled to cope with her mother,ex-husband, sister, various boyfriends and life. Some of the time,she didn't succeed.   The show, moved from time slot to time slot, eventually was castoff by NBC and picked up by Lifetime. And instead of being filmedin Los Angeles, ``Molly Dodd'' is now done in New York, where itsproduction team can take advantage of the city's theater people.   ``The pool of actors here is much grittier, much moreinteresting,'' Brown says. ``Now we have a little theatrical repcompany.''   Most of the show's scripts are written by playwright EricOvermyer, author of ``On the Verge,'' and directed by Don Scardino,a veteran theater performer who will direct the play ``A Few GoodMen'' on Broadway later this season.   Everyone took a salary cut when the show moved to cable becausethe licensing fees are less.   ``But it was worth it,'' Brown says. ``What's your choice? Notto do it because you are going to make more money doing somethingyou don't like?''   The size of the audience on cable is smaller, too _ ``We wereworried viewers wouldn't be able to find us'' _ but people stillrecognize Brown on the street.   ``It's nice, but then Molly is kind of a benevolent personality.It's not like Judy Carne's `sock-it-to-me' girl on `Laugh In.' Theydon't want to see how tough I am. They basically think I'm theirneighbor.''   And most don't think of her as a theater actress. Audiencesdon't realize that before there was ``The Days and Nights of MollyDodd'' or movies like ``Continental Divide'' with John Belushi orTV miniseries like ``Kennedy'' and ``Captains and the Kings,''there was the stage.   Brown, a native of Washington, D.C., has extensive andimpressive credits, starting with her training at the NationalTheatre of Canada. She ended up working at the Shakespeare Festivalin Stratford, Ontario, and in regional theaters across Canada andthe United States, including two seasons at the Guthrie inMinneapolis.   ``I was an ingenue, so I could always get work because I lookedthe right way,'' she says.   ``A couple years ago I was going in for an audition and I couldsee this director thinking, `Oh, this is a television actress, I'mgoing to cross over,''' she says. ``I wanted to take him by thethroat and yell, `Look at my credits.'''   Brown was given six months off from ``Molly Dodd'' to do ``TheSecret Rapture.'' If it runs long enough, she'll leave the playnext February to resume production of the television series.   ``It's very rare to have this much good material to do _especially material that is written for you,'' Brown says. ``Soit's just bad sportsmanship to complain. Just keep your mouth shutand count your lucky stars because it will soon be over.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
