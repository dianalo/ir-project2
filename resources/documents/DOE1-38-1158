<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-38-1158 </DOCNO><TEXT>The giant Gamow-Teller states in nuclei are studied through the (/sup3/He,t) reaction at energies from 600 MeV to 2.3 GeV. The Gamow-Tellertransition in the quark picture can lead to the excitation of the nucleonto the {Delta}-resonance. At /sup 3/He energies above 1.5 GeV the direct{Delta} excitation is observed both for the proton and for nuclei. Theproblem of missing strength in the observed Gamow-Teller states is addressedboth in terms of mixing of the 1p - 1h states into 2p - 2h states andin terms of a renormalization through admixture of the {Delta} excitation.9 refs., 34 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
