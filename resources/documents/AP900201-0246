Robson told critical members ofthe Senate Banking Committee, ``and we're going to break our necksto see that we get it done.''   The officials, a week after undergoing criticism from Housemembers over the slow pace of their work, endured similarcomplaints from the senators Wednesday.   ``Act decisively. Do what's necessary. Don't be timid,'' saidSen. Jake Garn of Utah, senior Republican on the Senate BankingCommittee.   ``Surely, surely there must be something you can do to speed upthe process,'' he said, warning that further delay by theResolution Trust Corp. will increase costs to the taxpayers.   On Wednesday, Arizona's largest savings institution,Phoenix-based MeraBank, was seized by the federal government. Theaction by the RTC made MeraBank the sixth Arizona savings and loanto be seized by the government, leaving only four operatingprivately.   The RTC has taken over some 350 Sandamp;Ls to date, disposing of 42 ofthem. However, 33 of the resolutions were completed in the agency'sfirst three months of operation and only nine since then.   ``The pace was a little slower than some of us would have likedto have seen,'' conceded Robson, acting chairman of the RTCoversight board.   Sens. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the bankingcommittee, and Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., were particularly critical ofthe administration's failure to fill many of the posts in the Sandamp;Lbureaucracy nearly six months after enactment of the bailout law.   ``It is impossible to understand how the thrift crisis can besuccessfully resolved with many of the key players not even inuniform ready to participate,'' Riegle said.   The administration has failed to appoint a new Office of ThriftSupervision director, two of the five members of the RTC oversightboard, an inspector general for the RTC, four of five members of aboard governing the 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks and a newmember of the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.   ``The urgency that was attached to this legislation seems tohave evaporated with its passage,'' Sarbanes complained.   Robson said the administration has had some difficulty findingcandidates whose business activities did not pose a conflict ofinterest. Also, he described the FBI clearance process as``draconian.''   However, he said the administration was ``very close'' to naminga fourth member of the RTC oversight board and said the candidatefor the agency's inspector general was undergoing background checks.   Robson also said if the $50 billion allocated to the RTC provedto be inadequate, the administration could ask Congress to``reallocate to earlier periods'' $32 billion earmarked forpost-1992 failures.</TEXT></DOC>
