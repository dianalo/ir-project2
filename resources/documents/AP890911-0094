At least 11people were reported killed in the latest fighting.   In the waters off the Christian sector, Syrian gunboats seized aship carrying supplies to the beleaguered Christians. A senior Iraqiofficial said Iraq will urge Arab League ministers to call anemergency Arab summit to press Syria to leave Lebanon.   The second gunfight in three days erupted in south Lebanon, whereIsraeli troops killed at least one guerrilla.   The mountain fighting centered on Ein el-Tuffaha, 18 miles eastof Beirut, and the Christian stronghold of Souk el-Gharb, 16 milesto the south. The two towns sit on roads leading to the Christianenclave from the predominantly Shiite Moslem Bekaa valley.   Syrian guns above Ein el-Tuffaha hammered the Christian town ofBekfaya for seven hours, setting the surrounding woods afire.   Bekfaya's estimated 15,000 people were trapped in basementsbecause fires blocked all escape routes from the town. Another 5,000people were stuck in nearby Ein Saadeh, said a police spokesman.   Both sides battled with tank fire overnight and through the dayMonday around Souk el-Gharb, ringed by Syria's Druse allies.   Along Beirut's dividing Green Line, Syrian and Christian troopsclashed with automatic weapons as howitzer and mortar guns thunderedoverhead, keeping the city's remaining 150,000 residents in bombshelters.   Most of Beirut's 1.5 million people have fled the battered cityover the past six months, seeking refuge in north, east and southLebanon.   Police said 11 people died and 34 were wounded in the latestSyrian-Christian duels. That raised the casualty toll to at least844 killed and 2,508 wounded since March 8, when fighting eruptedbetween the soldiers of Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aounand the Syrian army.   The mountain battles were the heaviest since the U.N. SecurityCouncil appealed for a cease-fire Aug. 16.   In recent weeks, the Syrians and Druse militiamen have beenpressuring the Christian defenses along the 66-mile mountain frontforming the eastern flank of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave,where an estimated 1 million Christians are trapped with their backsto the Mediterranean.   Two Syrian gunboats intercepted the merchant ship Carla about 20miles off the coast of the enclave at mid-morning as it tried tobring supplies to the Christians, a police spokesman said.   The vessel was escorted to the Syrian-controlled port of Tripoliin north Lebanon, the spokesman said, speaking on condition ofanonymity. He had no information about its nationality or owners.   The Syrian navy has turned back several ships trying to reach theChristian sector. Eight vessels have been sunk or set on fire bySyrian artillery.   Christian radio stations blamed the Syrians for the escalation infighting, claiming they want to sabotage peace efforts of an ArabLeague committee.   ``We're back to the same old game,'' said an announcer on theVoice of Free Lebanon radio. ``Whenever the committee schedules anew meeting, the Syrians let all hell break loose while publiclypledging cooperation to defuse the fighting.''   The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria, thethree members of the committee, are to meet Wednesday in SaudiArabia in an effort to reactivate peace efforts.   It will be their first meeting since July 28, when they saidefforts to reach a cease-fire had been stymied by Syrianintransigence.   The Syrians have 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 ArabLeague peacekeeping mandate to quell the civil war. Aoun says theSyrians betrayed their peacekeeping mission by siding with theMoslems in the civil war. The Syrians refuse to withdraw theirtroops.   A senior Iraqi official in Baghdad, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, told The Associated Press his country believes anemergency Arab League summit is the best way to end Lebanon's14-year-old war.   He said Iraq will urge Arab League ministers to call the summitto press Syria to leave Lebanon.   Iraq is Syria's archrival in the Arab world and backs Lebanon'sChristians.   In south Lebanon, Lebanese security sources said Israeli soldierskilled two guerrillas in a firefight in Israel's self-declared``security zone.'' The Israeli army said one guerrilla was killedand another captured.   The sources said two Israeli soldiers were wounded. The Israeliarmy reported three soldiers wounded.   The Lebanese National Resistance Front, a loose coalition ofpro-Syrian leftist and Palestinian guerrillas, claimedresponsibility for the shootout in a terse statement that gave noother details.   A source said the guerrillas infiltrated the security zone``possibly with the intention of attacking an Israeli post therewhen they were spotted.''   Israel carved out the 6- to 10-mile-wide strip to protect itselffrom guerrilla raids.</TEXT></DOC>
