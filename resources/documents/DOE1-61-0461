Sixteen groups of 8rats were simultaneously exposed to 800 {mu}g/m/sup 3/ for 0, 4, 8 or24 h/day during 2, 4, 8 or 16 days. In contrast to 4 and 8 h/day, exposurefor 24 h/day caused an enhancing effect on enzyme activities and proteincontent. Effects reached a plateau at 8 exposure days. Covariance analysisand fitting of polynomial submodels revealed that the influence of thenumber of exposure days on the ultimate effect is approximately halfthe influence of exposure time per day. If these results can be validatedfor human exposure, future assessment of public health risk and settingof ozone standards should take into account the predominant role of bothconcentration and exposure time per day as important factors of ozoneexposure.</TEXT></DOC>
