The council said that export contracts concluded by 17 major trading houses fell 15% in May from a year earlier, in contrast to a 0.5% increase in April. Export contracts declined in 15 of the 16 months through May, mainly because the strong yen has made Japanese goods more expensive on foreign markets.    Import contracts, meanwhile, rose 3.3% in May, following a 5.3% decline in April. The increase was the first in 19 months. Association officials cited recent oil-price stability and increased demand for lumber, which stemmed from government public-works projects and a construction boom triggered by low interest rates.    The 17 trading companies handle about 50% of Japan's exports and 65% of its imports.    Separately, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said production at Japan's factories and mines slipped 0.1% in May from a year earlier and a seasonally adjusted 0.6% from April. Industrial production has slumped because of the yen's strength.    In another report, the ministry said sales at major Japanese retail stores climbed 7.5% in May from a year earlier, the sharpest growth in 5 1/2 years. It cited brisk sales of summer clothing and other seasonal products because of unusually warm May weather. </TEXT></DOC>
