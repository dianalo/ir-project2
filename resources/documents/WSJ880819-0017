But now, even the libertine French are cracking down.    French entrepreneurs dish out pretty much the same fare that their U.S. counterparts provide: &quot;gab&quot; lines that dozens of people can dial to converse in language as off-color as strikes their fancy; private lines for one-on-one dirty talking; and prerecorded sex chatter. These services are known collectively as the &quot;pink telephone.&quot; (In French, the color pink connotes sexual titillation.)    The French also offer something not available in the U.S. -- the pink Minitel, which allows customers to send dirty messages to one another through video terminals, called Minitels, that are attached to millions of French phones.    As in the U.S., the gab lines have been a big money-maker. But, whereas in the U.S. they are extremely difficult to regulate, in France they are being banned. France Telecom, the nation's telecommunications authority, announced last month it will abolish the gab lines as of October.    &quot;We realized that every one of the chat lines was pink {pornographic},&quot; says a France Telecom official. He brushes aside protests from pink-telephone services that the action restricts free speech. &quot;There isn't any law that says we have to provide chat lines,&quot; the official says. He estimates that the gab lines were bringing their operators at least 100 million French francs ($15.6 million) a year.    Despite the ban, French officials say their crackdown on other forms of dial-a-porn is limited by the same legal void that exists in the U.S. Nothing in French law restricts what two individuals can say over a telephone line. Unless somebody involved can be judged guilty of &quot;inciting debauchery,&quot; the only way to prevent pornographic services is to close down an entire category of them -- as France has done with the gab lines.    But France Telecom won't take action against pre-recorded pornographic messages or the one-on-one dirty talking that is charged to credit cards. And it is moving only gingerly against the pink Minitel.    The telephone-connected Minitel network was established in 1982 to help people get information about telephone numbers, buy groceries, make reservations and perform other such tasks from their homes. Ultimately France intends to provide a simple computer terminal to every telephone subscriber, free of charge. So far, the government has invested more than $1 billion on the network, which counts 3.8 million terminals and is growing daily.    But to the surprise of authorities, the No. 1 user of the Minitel has become the dial-a-porn services, which carry names such as Ulla, Maude, and PPX-Projection. Call up Ulla and you can communicate by keyboard with users offering such come-ons as &quot;man seeks vicious woman.&quot;    Message exchanges now account for at least 20% of all Minitel use. At least half of these message exchanges are pornographic. While use is leveling off, the pornographic services account for more than 100 million francs a year in billings.    Occasionally, people who find sex partners through the Minitel have wound up robbed, raped or both. Authorities acknowledge children sometimes dial onto the pornographic services.    The government isn't about to abolish the whole message service; it has invested too much money in the Minitels for that. Instead, it has persuaded the services to adopt an &quot;ethics code,&quot; under which they promise to avoid inciting prostitution or encouraging the use of pornography by minors.    Service operators are expected to remove any messages that seem too blatantly sexual. A user calling up the Ulla service, for example, sees not only a computer drawing of a reclining nude, but also a warning that prostitution and use of the service by minors are forbidden. Services that won't sign the code of conduct have been pressured to close.    &quot;Personally, I doubt that the government will really do anything,&quot; says Brigitte Chapouthier of the Federation of French Families. Her organization pressed the government to file charges of &quot;attracting attention to opportunities for debauchery&quot; against five pink Minitel services this year. It lost but is appealing the decision. Meanwhile, the French Senate is considering proposals for closer regulation of the Minitel services. </TEXT></DOC>
