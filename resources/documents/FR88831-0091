The NPS isproposing revised management policies for new area studies and criteriafor determining national significance. These policies, in their final form,will be incorporated in the revised National Park Service Management Policiesas a part of chapter 2. The corrections are mainly minor but importanteditorial changes and a modification of the definition for suitabilityto consider that resources may be adequately protected, represented andpresented for public enjoyment by another land managing entity. The revisedtext as shown below should be the one commented on.

This statement updates the policy in effectsince 1978 to more clearly distinguish significance considerations fromquestions of suitability, feasibility, and management alternatives. Theproposed policy outlines four basic significance factors that apply tonatural, cultural, and recreation resources and provides examples for eachcategory of resource. This approach replaces the separate criteria fornational recreation areas that appeared in the 1978 policies. The revisedpolicy outlines criteria for new national park system units, but does notaddress what designation (park, monument, seashore, recreation area) wouldbe most appropriate. Introductory material in the 1978 policy has beencondensed to avoid duplication with other chapters in the new managementpolicies. The new policy statement also includes a definition and criteriafor affiliated areas.The Service is hereby soliciting comment from any and all interested groupsor individuals on these policies. We urge you to be specific as to howthe policy might be changed or strengthened. All comments will be reviewedand, when appropriate, incorporated. The policies will remain on reviewfor 30 days. The revised final policy and an explanation of how commentswere addressed will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. These policies, in final form, will become apart of chapter 2 of the National Park Service Management Policies.<ITAG tagnum="6">Denis P. Galvin,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Director.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="34">August 25, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">New Area Studies and Criteria</ITAG>The National Park Service identifies nationally significant natural, cultural,and recreational resources and assists in their preservation both insideand outside the national park system. The areas managed by the NationalPark Service are only one part of a national inventory of special and protectedareas managed by innumerable federal, state, and local agencies and theprivate sector. Consequently, addition to the national park system is onlyone of many alternatives for ensuring the preservation of significant nationalresources for public enjoyment and benefit. A great variety of speciallydesignated areas, including natural landmarks, historic landmarks, wildand scenic rivers, trails, wilderness areas, areas of critical environmentalconcern, biosphere reserves, and recreation areas, managed by the U.S.Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, otherfederal, state, county, and local agencies, Indian tribes, and the privatesector, complete the broader national inventory.As directed by Congress, the National Park Service will study and monitorareas to determine if they are nationally significant and if so, whetherthey have potential for inclusion in the national park system. Planningfor the future of the national park system is guided by a framework ofthemes representing all the aspects of America's natural and cultural heritage.Additions to the system recognize new understanding of natural resources,national recreational trends, and the continuing progress of history. Newarea studies may be initiated within the Service or may be conducted inresponse to requests from Congress, other federal, state, or local agencies,or the private sector. The Service will review all proposals and provideadvice about planning, studies, or other appropriate actions. Where formalnew area studies are appropriate, the Service will establish prioritiesand conduct studies as funds are available.To be eligible for favorable consideration as a unit of the national parksystem, an area must (1) possess nationally significant natural, cultural,or recreational resources, (2) be a suitable and feasible addition to thesystem, and (3) require direct Park Service management instead of alternativeprotection by other agencies or the private sector. These criteria aredesigned to ensure that the national park system includes only outstandingexamples of the nation's natural, cultural, and recreational resources.They also recognize that inclusion in the national park system is not theonly option for preserving the nation's outstanding resources.Criteria for National SignificanceA natural, cultural, or recreational resource will be considered nationallysignificant if it meets all of the following criteria:It is an outstanding example of a particular type of resource.It possesses exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpretingthe natural or cultural themes of our nation's heritage.It offers opportunities for recreation, public use, and enjoyment or forscientific study superior to other resources of the same type.It retains integrity as a true, accurate, and relatively unspoiled exampleof a resource.Examples of natural resources that may be nationally significant include:An outstanding site that illustrates the characteristics of a landformor biotic area that is still widespread;A rare remnant natural landscape or biotic area of a type that was oncewidespread but is now vanishing due to human settlement and development;A landform or biotic area that has always been extremely uncommon in theregion or nation;A site possessing exceptional diversity of ecological components (species,communities, habitats) or geologic features (landforms, observable manifestationsof geologic processes);A site containing biotic species or communities whose natural distributionat that location makes them unusual (a relatively large population at thelimit of its range, or an isolated population);A site harboring a concentrated population of a rare plant or animal species,particularly one officially recognized as threatened or endangered;A critical refuge necessary for the continued survival of a species;A site containing a rare or unusually abundant fossil deposits;An area with outstanding scenic qualities, such as dramatic topographicfeatures, unusual contrasts in landforms or vegetation, spectacular vistas,or other landscape features;A site that is an invaluable ecological or geological benchmark due toan extensive and long-term record of research and scientific discovery.Nationally significant cultural resources include districts, sites, buildings,structures, or objects that possess exceptional value or quality in illustratingor interpreting our heritage and that possess a high degree of integrityof location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association.Examples of cultural resources that may be nationally significant includethose that_Are associated with events that have made a significant contribution toand are identified with, or that outstandingly represent, the broad nationalpatterns of United States history and from which an understanding and appreciationof those patterns may be gained;Are associated importantly with the lives of persons nationally significantin the history of the United States;Represent some great idea or ideal of the American people; Embody the distinguishing characteristics of an architectural type specimen,exceptionally valuable for study of a period, style, or method of constructionor that represent a significant, distinctive, and exceptional entity whosecomponents may lack individual distinction; Are composed of integral parts of the environment not sufficiently significantby reason of historical association or artistic merit to warrant individualrecognition but collectively compose an entity of exceptional historicalor artistic significance, or outstandingly commemorate or illustrate away of life or culture; Have yielded or may be likely to yield information of major scientificimportance by revealing new cultures or by shedding light upon periodsof occupation over large areas of the United States.Ordinarily cemeteries, birthplaces, graves of historic figures, propertiesowned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, structuresthat have been moved from their original locations, reconstructed historicbuildings, and properties that have achieved significance within the past50 years are not considered appropriate for addition to the national parksystem unless they have transcendent importance, unless they possess inherentarchitectural or artistic significance, or unless no other site associatedwith that theme remains. Examples of recreation resources that may be nationally significant include_A natural or cultural feature providing a special setting for a varietyof recreational activities different from those available at the localor regional level;A spacious area located near a major population center with the potentialto provide exceptional recreational opportunities and to serve visitorsfrom around the nation rather than solely from the immediate vicinity;An area that protects a unique recreation resource that is scarce and disappearingin a multi-state region, such as an outstanding recreational river, a uniquemaritime environment or coastline, or a unique scenic area; A unique combination of natural, cultural, and recreational resources thatcollectively offer outstanding opportunities for public use and enjoymenteven through each feature might not individually be considered nationallysignificant.Suitability and FeasibilityTo be suitable for addition to the national park system an area must representa natural/cultural theme or type of recreational resource that is not alreadyadequately represented in the national park system unless such an areais adequately represented, protected, and presented for public enjoymentby another land managing entity. Adequacy or representation will be determinedon a case-by-case basis by evaluating the proposed addition in relationto other units in the national park system.To be feasible as a new unit of the national park system an area must beof sufficient size and appropriate configuration to ensure long-term protectionof resources and to accommodate public use, and it must have potentialfor efficient administration at a reasonable cost. Important feasibilityfactors include landownership, acquisition costs, access, threats to theresource, and staff or development requirements. Management AlternativesStudies of potential new park units will evaluate an appropriate rangeof management alternatives, which may include_Continued management by states, local governments, Indian tribes, the privatesector, or other federal agencies;Technical or financial assistance to others through established NPS programsor special projects;Management by others as a designated national natural landmark, nationalhistoric landmark, national wild and scenic river, national trail, biospherereserve, state or local park, or other specially designated and protectedarea; Cooperative management, including designation as an affiliated area.New additions to the national park system will not usually be recommendedif other arrangements can provide adequate protection for the resourceand opportunities for public enjoyment. Affiliated AreasCongress and the Secretary of the Interior have given special recognitionto a small group of areas that are affiliated with but not technicallypart of the national park system. These affiliated areas are protectedand managed by other organizations and agencies, but they have some formalfinancial or legal relationship with the National Park Service, often includingtechnical or financial assistance beyond what is normally available tonational landmarks.To be eligible for affiliated status, areas must meet the same criteriafor national significance as national landmarks or potential units of thenational park system. However, affiliated areas are not necessarily suitableor feasible as new units of the system. Designation as an affiliated areais a management alternative appropriate for resources that can be mosteffectively protected by others through a cooperative arrangement withthe National Park Service. Although the National Park Service does nothave direct management responsibility for affiliated areas, the Serviceusually enters into an agreement to assure that management and operationsmeet Park Service standards.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-19752 Filed 8-30-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4310-70-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
