(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sundstrand Corp., a major aerospacecontractor, has agreed in principle to plead guilty to filing falsestatements with the government and pay $12.5 million forovercharging on military work, a newspaper reported.   The proposed plea agreement covers allegations that thecompany's Seattle-based Sundstrand Data Control unit improperlyincluded patent-litigation expenses in overhead costs on governmentmilitary contracts, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday,quoting unidentified sources.   Sundstrand said in a filing with the Securities and ExchangeCommission that it expected to face unspecified criminal charges inboth Washington state and Illinois in connection with federal grandjury investigations of its accounting methods for handlinggovernment contracts and tax matters.   ``The government has advised that it intends to charge thecompany with criminal violations in both districts,'' Sundstrand'sfiling stated.   The document also reported that the company, Rockford's largestemployer, was working on a settlement in one, and possibly both, ofthe actions.   Federal charges could lead to the suspension of new governmentcontracts for Sundstrand, which had $579 million in military salesin 1987.   But if the company settled the dispute by paying ``materiallyadverse fines and penalties,'' it might be suspended onlytemporarily from new government business, according to Sundstrand'sfiling.</TEXT></DOC>
