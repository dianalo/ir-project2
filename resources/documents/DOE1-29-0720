Parameters withhigh sensitivity included deposition technique, number of factory shifts,degree of automation, and throughput. Parameters with low sensitivityincluded semiconductor materials cost and equipment lifetime. To comparetechnologies of different efficiencies, the authors calculated electricitycosts (levelized in constant 1984 dollars) over a 30-yr module lifetime.BOS costs are about 45% of the total. Costs were highly sensitive toefficiency. Calculated levelized costs for a baseline CuInSe/sub 2/ modulefactory were 7.6 to 6.7 c/kW-hr for efficiencies of 13 to 15%. Resultsfor process variation and for monolithic and mechanically stacked cascadeswere compared in terms of technical considerations and cost. Monolithiccascades potentially have the highest efficiency and lowest cost/kW-hr,but require stringent yield tolerance.</TEXT></DOC>
