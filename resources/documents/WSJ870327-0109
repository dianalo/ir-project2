The Constitution also gives the vice president specific duties as the president's assistant chief of foreign policy.    And the Supreme Court has 13 members.    These are some results of a constitutional convention recently convened with 52 Virginia high-school students by the College of William and Mary's Marshall-Wythe Law School in the historic setting of Colonial Williamsburg's restored Capitol.    But the main news from last weekend's convention (the original was closed to the press) is that after two days of arguing, cajoling and compromising, the modern-day delegates decided that the original document, as amended, needed few changes.    &quot;The truth was you weren't signing your Constitution at all; the truth was you were signing the original,&quot; Fred Lederer, the law professor who organized the convention, told the students at the signing ceremony.    Delegates rejected a voter literacy test, a flat income tax and creation of a House of Revenue with representation based on a state's tax revenue. A proposal to limit the terms of Supreme Court members also was defeated after a hot debate over the &quot;senility factor.&quot;    But the youthful delegates, with 200 years' hindsight, did decide that some of their Founding Fathers' ideas needed updating. The vice president was assigned specific duties, for example, because &quot;You have to give the guy something to do,&quot; explained Melanie Tatum, 17 years old, from Martinsville.    Because of concern about budget deficits, the president has a line-item veto. But delegates rejected a balanced-budget requirement.    In the new Constitution, the term &quot;Congress&quot; doesn't exist, and the legislature consists of a House of Representation and a House of States. The chief justice isn't picked by the president but is elected by the Supreme Court members. The president and the justices, if impeached, can be removed from office only by a unanimous vote of a panel of 12 federal judges. English is the official language of the country, and the people vote every 25 years on whether to hold a new constitutional convention.    The provisions were thrashed out during the weekend convention after a day and a half of preparation and previous weighty reading assignments about the Constitution. The delegates -- high-school juniors and seniors selected by their school districts -- represented the 13 original colonies. In contrast to the all-male, all-white delegation at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, a handful of these delegates were black, and more than half of the delegates were women.    The only one who actually portrayed an original participant was 16-year-old Rob Nagle of Williamsburg. Dressed in Colonial garb and a white wig, he was George Washington, the convention president, and he incorporated historical events into his role. Calling the roll of delegations, he paused at Rhode Island, which boycotted the convention in 1787, and said, &quot;It's good to have you here. There was some talk that you wouldn't attend.&quot;    Closing the convention's first day, Mr. Washington admonished the delegates to &quot;use your spirit of compromise.&quot; And compromise they did. Many proposals were revised, scrapped or defeated as the pace picked up in caucuses the last night and on the convention floor the last day.    A small band of delegates fought vehemently for a third house in the legislature, the House of Revenue, with representation based on the tax base and gross revenue generated by a state. &quot;A state that creates a lot of revenue for the federal government . . . should have more of a say over how this money is spent,&quot; argued Brad Gaub, 17, of Fort Lee. But Robert Kramer, 17, of Alexandria, countered that it &quot;would be a travesty of justice&quot; to make representation based on the tax base.    The issue threatened to stalemate the convention, and a heated caucus was convened outside to work on a compromise. But in the end, both the third house and a proposal to factor tax base into the House of Representation were rejected.    A proposal for a balanced budget was rejected as too limiting. A compromise, the result of another caucus, was also rejected because it simply proposed nonbinding language that the delegates felt didn't belong in the Constitution.    A battle occurred over a proposal by Grey Tarkenton, 18, of Newport News, for a flat-rate federal income tax. &quot;The only way to be fair is to have everybody at the same rate of taxes,&quot; said Mr. Tarkenton, but he was soundly defeated.    A literacy exam was proposed for the right to vote, but it, too, was rejected. &quot;It's an attempt to have a literate populace voting in the elections,&quot; argued Lee Ann Anderson, 17, of Dillwyn. Countered Jean Whichard, 17, of West Point, Va.: &quot;Aren't representatives supposed to be for the whole population, literate or not?&quot;    Several ideas were debated, but rejected, to limit the term of Supreme Court justices. &quot;When you talk about a life term, often the world changes, but they still hold the same views, they become disconnected from what the country needs,&quot; said Gretchen Stocks, 18, of Franklin.    &quot;A life term is good,&quot; replied Nash Dunnigan, 17, of Williamsburg, though &quot;in case of the senility factor, there has to be some system of review.&quot; The life term prevailed. And the high court was increased to 13 justices from nine to provide a wider variety of views.    Other expected fights either didn't materialize or were muted by compromise. Early talk about permitting time for voluntary prayer in the schools gave way to a lengthy, ambiguous proposal for freedom of religion as long as it doesn't infringe on the rights of &quot;unwilling participants.&quot;    A heated caucus discussion over who should be guaranteed equality with whom produced a proposal to protect people from bias based on race, sex, political affiliation and sexual preference. But some argued that this was too specific, and the plan was scrapped for a guarantee of &quot;equal protection of the laws.&quot; There isn't any equal-rights amendment. The document, in fact, generally uses masculine pronouns, rather than any his-or-her constructions.    The new Constitution requires a federal department of education to set national standards for teacher certification, to test for recertification, to keep teacher salaries high and to develop a national curriculum.    Freedom of speech and the news media are protected. But there are some exceptions open to broad interpretations that would trouble civil libertarians, such as when free-speech rights pose a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; to national security or infringe on individual &quot;rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&quot;    Surprisingly, the issue of government covert activities raised by the current Iran-Contra affair didn't come up on the convention floor. Because of time pressures, the delegates didn't get to a proposed constitutional provision requiring the creation of an &quot;executive intelligence agency,&quot; headed by the vice president, that would &quot;search for unethical practices in the executive branch.&quot;    The final Constitution, which was approved unanimously, became a blend of the old and the new. When voting was completed, an IBM personal computer spewed out the final draft. But the delegates signed it with genuine quill pens.    What lesson was learned from all this about the U.S. Constitution? &quot;It's more a question of what people do with it than the document itself,&quot; said Paul Gushurst, 16, of Fredericksburg. &quot;That's what has made our country successful.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
