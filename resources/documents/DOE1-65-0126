<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-65-0126 </DOCNO><TEXT>An offshore platform structure comprising a deck superstructure is supportedby at least three spaced apart inclined lower supporting columns extendingconvergingly upwards towards an intermediate structure supporting thedeck superstructure. At least the lower supporting columns have varyingdiameter, the columns having their largest diameter in the area of thewater line during the towing-out of the platform structure from the constructionsite to its offshore location. Slipforming means for slipforming inclined,hollow columns of reinforced concrete comprise a slipform platform includingformwork which is supported by, and may be lifted or lowered by meansof, a climbing rod system which is secured to the already cast, curedportions of the column. The formwork is suspended from the slipform platformby means of yokes and comprises inner and outer slipforms extending inthe circumferential direction. The yokes are adjustable in the radialdirection with respect to the slipform platform while the slipforms areadjustable in the tangential or circumferential direction with respectto each other. One of the slipform walls is radially adjustable withrespect to the other. The slipforming means is especially suited to theslipforming of hollow, inclined columns having increasing and/or decreasingdiameter.</TEXT></DOC>
