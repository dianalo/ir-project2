The official Tass news agency said troops also escorted 43trucks _ 13 carrying food _ to destinations in Nagorno-Karabakh,the predominantly Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan that is the mainpoint of contention.   Although many shipments got through, ``The situation remainstense in Azerbaijan and the blockade of Armenia continues,'' Tasssaid Thursday night, citing reports from the Interior Ministry,which is in charge of law enforcement.   ``In August and September, 32,000 rail cars ... failed to reachArmenia from Azerbaijan due to sabotage,'' Moscow radio said. InAzerbaijan, ``bridges were burned and trains were attacked withfire'' to prevent them from reaching Armenia.   It said troops were sent after the Supreme Soviet legislatureadopted an emergency resolution Tuesday ordering the ministries ofdefense and interior to restore rail traffic between the southernrepublics in the Caucasus Mountains.   On Thursday night Tass said 21 freight trains totaling 603 cars_ 101 carrying fuel _ went to Armenia through the Caucasus. But itsaid 171 freight cars were still idled in Azerbaijan, including 89originally destined for Armenia.   Most supplies for Armenia must pass through Azerbaijan.   The blockades were said to be an outgrowth of the dispute overwhich republic should control Nagorno-Karabakh, a ChristianArmenian enclave which has been part of Moslem-dominated Azerbaijansince 1923. The dispute has claimed 117 lives since violenceerupted 19 months ago.   Avel Pogosyan, an editor at Armenpress news agency in Yerevan,Armenia's capital, said in a telephone interview that troops beganarriving Wednesday night. He gave no information as to how many.   Striking rail workers in Azerbaijan, motivated by theirgovernment's demands that it retain control over Nagorno-Karabakh,created a virtual economic blockade of Armenia by blocking raillines and sabotaging cargoes, news reports said.   In Azerbaijan's capital of Baku, an editor at the officialAzerinform news agency said no sign was seen of troops in theCaspian Sea port city and trains there were not being guarded. Hespoke on condition of anonymity.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim P. Perfilyev said he had noinformation on deployment of troops in the republics.   Because of the blockade and sabotage, workers in Armenia do nothave fuel and supplies to continue attempts to rebuild housingdemolished by the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed 25,000 people,Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya said.   ``Thousands of tons of fuel have not been delivered and as aresult, even emergency aid vehicles cannot be filled with fuel,''the newspaper said. ``As winter approaches, restoration plans arenot being fulfilled and foreign specialists are leavingconstruction sites.''   The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted Azerbaijani DeputyProsecutor R. Safarliev as saying the strike was in retaliation forpurported Armenian sabotage of Azerbaijan railroads in July andAugust.   ``This actually provoked the strike by railroad workers ... .andthe blockade itself,'' Safarliev said. But he added, ``I want toemphasize that these measures cannot be justified.''</TEXT></DOC>
