Ms. Nakamura said her group and 51 others representing most majorJapanese women's organizations will submit a letter to Uno,demanding he confirm or deny the report and explain his feelingstoward ``sex as a product you can buy.''   Among those calling for Uno to step down are such diverse groupsas the Japan Communist Party and a national anti-prostitutionorganization headed by a former legislator.   ``He is not qualified to hold such an office,'' theanti-prostitution group said in a statement.   Chairwoman Michiko Matsuura of the 5,000-member League of WomenVoters said, ``Overall, the status of women is moving in the rightdirection. But what worries us is that the scandal involves the manat the top, the man with ultimate responsibility for enforcing thelaws that guarantee women's rights.''   According to the report, published soon after Uno became primeminister on June 2, an unidentified, 40-year-old woman said Uno paidher $2,100 a month to be his mistress for four months in 1985.   ``He is not a man of noble character,'' the woman allegedly toldthe respected weekly magazine Sunday Mainichi. ``I don't want him touse politics the same way he treated me.''   Uno has avoided replying to opposition lawmakers' questions inparliament on the subject, saying he will not comment publicly onpersonal matters as the assembly's rules permit.   ``We were shocked ... when we heard the questioning in theparliament session,'' said a joint statement from the League ofWomen Voters, the Japan Nurses Association and five otherorganizations representing 6 million women. ``The prime ministermust clearly and honestly answer to the charges.''   Dalliances of public officials often have been ignored by themedia, but chief editor Shuntaro Torigoe said his Sunday magazinepublished the article to bring social ethics into the public arena.   The latest scandal comes as the Liberal Democratic Party, whichhas run Japan for 34 years, struggles to regroup after theresignation of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who left officebecause of links to an influence-peddling scandal that has involvedmuch of the governing elite.   Uno is considered a weak politician, but the party chose himbecause of his unblemished reputation after another scandal-freeparty elder refused the post.   Analysts say party leaders had hoped Uno would polish the party'simage before late July elections for half the seats in the upperhouse of parliament. But Matsuura told The Associated Press thatstrategy may have backfired.   ``Most women, and I think most men, are concerned with hisconduct,'' she said, noting more than half of Japan's 88.9 millionvoters are women. ``His handling of this affair will be reflected atthe polls.''   Standing to benefit most is the biggest opposition party, theSocialists, whose popular leader Takako Doi is the only woman at thehelm of a major party. Ms. Doi has not commented on the scandal,though a female Socialist legislator was the first to raise it inparliament.   The mass-circulation Asahi Shimbun newspaper has quoted one ofUno's campaign officials as saying the scandal is irrelevant.   However, Uno's administration will lead the Liberal Democrats toelections with the lowest support rating registered by a newgovernment _ 22 percent, according to a poll by Mainichi Shimbun,Japan's third-largest newspaper.   Political analyst and author Asao Yamaguchi says changingattitudes toward women may have helped the scandal snowball, butmore important is a general feeling of distrust toward politiciansengendered by the influence-peddling affair.   ``If it was only a sex scandal, male voters might not havecared,'' Yamaguchi said ``But Uno didn't foster much confidence fromthe start, and this just adds to the dissatisfaction.''</TEXT></DOC>
