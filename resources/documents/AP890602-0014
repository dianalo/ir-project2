(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 7-year-old boy mutilated in a sexualattack is acting as if nothing is wrong after his release from thehospital: he wants to return to school and get a new Nintendo game,his mother says.   People shocked by the attack have donated about $200,000 to helpthe boy resume a normal life.   ``It's a miracle,'' Helen Harlow, the child's mother, saidWednesday after he was released from Mary Bridge's Hospital.   ``The fact that he's healing so rapidly and that his spirits areso high and that the trauma doesn't seem to have made any kind ofmental block is something else,'' she said in an interview withKING-TV in Seattle.   He was raped and choked May 20 by a man who lured him into thewoods while the boy was riding his bike. The child's penis was cutoff in the attack.   Earl Kenneth Shriner, who authorities said has a history ofviolence against young people, has been charged in the assault.   Ms. Harlow said her son, who has a different last name, is eagerto resume a normal life and wants to go back to school.   ``He's not looking at this as a problem. He's just looking at itas how it is and now let's get on with life. `Where's the nextNintendo game? I needed Zelda One, not Zelda Two.'''   Ms. Harlow added that she wants to do what she can ``to makesure this kind of thing never happens again and to thank everybodythat's been so wonderful.''   Officials said Wednesday that people have donated $200,000 to atrust fund and the hospital waived $12,000 in bills. In addition,the state Crime Victim Compensation fund most likely will pay up to$150,000 for his remaining medical and counseling bills.   The state pays up to that amount for anyone who is an innocentvictim of a felony or gross misdemeanor, said Mark McDermott, whoadministers the program.   The boy's mother has said neither she nor his father havemedical insurance to cover the child.   Police Detective Stan Mowre, who led the fund-raising effort,said details of how the ``Community Cares Trust Fund'' will beadministered are being worked out. But he said, ``All moneys willgo for expenditure of the boy for education and medical bills.''   Just how much the boy's medical and counseling care will costover his lifetime remains a big question. Doctors say the boy willneed reconstructive surgery to rebuild his penis, and he alreadyhas begun seeing a mental health counselor.   Throughout the state, people have dug into their pockets at Elksmeetings, grocery stores and taverns to help. Mail stuffed withletters, checks and cash has arrived by the bucket at Pacific FirstFederal Savings Bank's James Center branch, said manager JimBichsel.   The mail run peaked Tuesday when the bank received 1,500 checksand letters, said Debbie Anderson, personal banking representative.There also have been two offers of computers and a trip toDisneyland.   ``It's kind of fun,'' Bichsel said. ``There's a sense of unityamong the staff to get it done for him. It's part of theircontribution.''</TEXT></DOC>
