The attorney general faced angry questions Wednesday about hisplans for new Justice Department guidelines being drafted to stemthe flow of unauthorized information.   During the tense session, Thornburgh defended the Bureau ofPrison's proposal to limit each inmate to one press interview amonth as part of ``what is necessary to properly manage prisonfacilities.''   But late in the day, Thornburgh abruptly and unexpectedly issueda brief statement saying he had ordered the Bureau of Prisons towithdraw the proposed regulations, which had been put out forpublic comment.   The plan would have limited the number of press interviews ateach prison facility to one a day.   Thornburgh had also faced hostile questioning about a provisionof the plan that would have empowered wardens to bar futureinterviews by reporters who failed to seek comment from officialsabout allegations made by inmates of mistreatment or otherconditions.   Ed Koren, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Unionprison project called the provision a form of censorship designed``to cut off any kind of criticism and to protect the Bureau ofPrisons from any embarrassments.''   Thornburgh told reporters the regulations were designed toensure an ``accurate flow of information.''   ``I think there is a problem that they are trying to address ofreconciling their management responsibility with the flow ofinformation in and out of prisons.''   But the attorney general said he had not personally reviewed theproposed regulations before they were published in Tuesday'sFederal Register.   In his statement released late in the day, Thornburgh said``this proposal was submitted prematurely and without my personalreview. It will be subject to further review before resubmission.''   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said Thornburgh wastold of the proposed regulations Tuesday night. He decidedWednesday afternoon to order them rescinded. He met Wednesdaymorning with reporters.   James Jones, chief spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons saidthere were only a few changes from current policy in the proposedregulations. He said the bureau has long required reporters to seekits response to allegations about prison conditions made by inmates.   Thornburgh said leaks of information about criminalinvestigations prompted him to order a full review this fall ofpress guidelines in the department and all its component agencies.   ``I expect it to result in two things: one, that we will havesome success in reducing the number of leaks of pending criminalinvestigations and, secondly... that we speak with one voice onpolicy matters.   ``It was `let's leak like a sieve' when I got here,'' Thornburghsaid.   The attorney general repeated his warning that he wouldprosecute department officials who leak details of an ongoingcriminal investigation.   ``Those persons are criminals themselves because they violatethe privacy statutes and the theft of government property statutesthat the Congress has enacted.''   Thornburgh has ordered investigations of numerous leaks,including a probe to identify the source who disclosed aninvestigation of alleged financial irregularities in the office ofRep. William Gray III, D-Pa.   The leak unleashed a storm of accusations from House Democratsthat the disclosure was politically orchestrated by Thornburgh'saides while Gray was seeking election as House majority whip.   The department eventually issued a statement saying Gray wascooperating with the investigation and wasn't a target.   Asked Wednesday if he were satisfied the Gray leak had not comefrom his staff, Thornburgh said: ``I haven't had an opportunity toreview the results of the investigation.''   The review of department press guidelines that Thornburgh saidhe ordered earlier this fall has already resulted in new pressguidelines at the Immigration and Naturalization Service.   Gene McNary, the new INS commissioner, ordered all field officesto get clearance from Washington before responding to a widevariety of press questions.   In September, Runkel had rebuked Drug Enforcement Agencyofficials for confirming reports that DEA agents had arranged thesale of crack in a park near the White House at the request ofPresident Bush's speechwriters.   The president, displaying a plastic envelope containing thecrack, told of the undercover sale in his televised speech tounveil his anti-drug strategy.</TEXT></DOC>
