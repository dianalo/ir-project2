Floating-rate note trading continued to be volatile, as it has been for the past three sessions. But the fact that some issues had fallen as much as two to three points since the middle of last week lured back investors, spurring a rebound.    Major U.S. bank issues, which had some of the sharpest declines in the past few sessions, closed as much as one point higher. Some sovereign issues were 1/2 point higher.    Japanese banks, which are major holders of floating-rate notes, reportedly weren't active, partly because they are reluctant to open big new positions just before the March 31 close of their fiscal year. But traders reported major retail orders from the U.S.    &quot;People have caught on to the fact that at these price levels, they can lock in some fairly good spreads,&quot; said a specialist for one large U.S. investment bank.    Traders said yesterday's performance doesn't mean floating-rate notes have recovered from their liquidity problems. But with retail orders appearing, there was less opportunity for the aggressive short-selling that apparently helped trigger the past week's sharp drop in prices, specialists said.    In contrast to the floating-rate note drama, fixed-rate Eurodollar bond prices were little changed in light turnover. &quot;Investors still are apathetic toward dollar-denominated issues,&quot; said a syndication official at one U.S. bank.    Added another: &quot;The markets are stuck in a tight range, and they are going to remain in limbo until we see some significant news on the U.S. economy or in the currencies.&quot;    One of the few new offerings to emerge was a $200 million, 7 1/2, five-year issue by Meritor Savings Bank, a U.S. institution, launched through Goldman Sachs International Corp.    Traders at other banks said the bonds were a bit tight in pricing, even though the borrower is rated triple-A by Moody's Investors' Service Inc. and the issue is collateralized by U.S. Treasurys and agency securities.    But Richard Sharp, manager of syndication at Goldman Sachs, said the issue had &quot;held up satisfactorily.&quot;    GMAC Canada Ltd. found strong demand for its $100 million (Canadian) of 8 1/2%, five-year Eurobonds. The issue was launched via Union Bank of Switzerland (Securities) Ltd.    British government bond prices gained as much as 1 5/8 points after the government's fiscal 1988 budget announcement, which is expected to be bullish for the market.    Dealers said prices were marked up as soon as the budget announcement was finished. Although they reported little business during the speech, they said there was a little domestic buying at the higher levels after it. </TEXT></DOC>
