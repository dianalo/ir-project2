Mr. Nazer will fly to Moscow today and is expected to meet several high-ranking officials, including the Soviet foreign trade minister and the head of the state economic foreign relations committee.    Arab diplomatic sources noted that the choice of a Saudi senior minister to carry on OPEC's mission of persuading non-OPEC producers to cooperate with the cartel is a departure from past practices. Previously, Kuwait's oil minister and, before him, Algeria's oil minister undertook contacts with the Soviets. </TEXT></DOC>
