The new production premiered last Friday and put some sparkle into a lackluster schedule.    Who would have expected such wonders from &quot;Rheingold&quot;? Of the four operas constituting the master's &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, &quot;Rheingold&quot; is the talkiest and dullest, although its brevity is certainly in its favor. It's an introductory work, presenting characters, tall and small, who start the raging feuds between gods and mortals that pulverize Valhalla at the end of the tetralogy in &quot;Gotterdammerung.&quot;    Wagner hammered away at his &quot;Ring&quot; for decades and not until 1876 was it finished -- an epic disquisition on power, greed, lust and love, voiced by singers wearing impossibly silly costumes in the Nordic mode. Since then, the sandals, bearskins, horned helmets and breastplates have slowly given way to other styles -- mainly outer-space gear, Victorian costumes or modern dress.    Already in 1898, that pioneer Wagnerian, George Bernard Shaw, interpreted the &quot;Ring&quot; as an anti-capitalist, socialist parable written by a composer who scampered between radicalism and luxury all his life. What difference, Shaw asked, is there between the wishing cap that makes its wearer disappear or change form, and a &quot;tall hat . . . which makes a man invisible as a shareholder . . .?&quot;    This is not the type of question that caused a lot of head-scratching at the Met when director Otto Schenk and set designer Gunther Schneider-Siemssen sat down to shape a new &quot;Ring.&quot; Neither is known to charge into the vanguard of controversy. Their &quot;Die Walkure&quot; staging last season stepped back in time to Wagner's day and &quot;Rheingold&quot; is done in the same, old-fashioned fairy-tale style inspired by the original &quot;Ring&quot; in Bayreuth.    So as an investment, this &quot;Ring&quot; looks as safe as a 12-month CD. But if you come to this opera house looking for adventure you are a ninny anyway. Bruce Crawford, the Met's general manager, has told you many times that the Met is turning traditional (from what?) and that controversial productions are going to be as hard to find on its stage as quarters in the ocean, lumps of gold in the Rhine or dragons in the forest.    There is, of course, a dragon in this production -- a polyped reptile so sweet it would cause little commotion if walked on a leash in the Met lobby. Photos suggest Wagner's first beast was bigger and better. But I doubt his yodeling maidens splashed around in a watery realm as shimmering as the Met's. Cleverly deployed projections, scrims, billowing material and lifts turn the stage into a gigantic aquarium. Dwarf Alberich (Franz Mazura) scrambles around the bottom like a horrible black crab, bagging the gold when he can't get a maiden.    Smooth hydraulic lifts then take all the bizarre characters in this opera to their hide-outs: Alberich's eerily lit mine and the barren landscape where the gods stand around moping.    Mr. Schenk's direction is not always evident. If Siegfried Jerusalem was an unusually agile Loge (Wotan's chief counsel), the chief god himself was unusually inert. James Morris delivered his lines with a penetrating baritonal glint, but he has not yet finished growing into this significant role, and his oddly tatty costume did not help him look important. Waltraud Meier easily lorded it over him, in her debut as Fricka, Wotan's yackety wife. This is not a large role, but the German mezzo proved to be an exceptionally vivid performer with a timbre as radiant as her appearance. Who didn't want to follow her over the rainbow bridge to Valhalla, even if it looked like a Trump casino, slathered with gobs of gold and no windows?    James Levine conducted, sometimes so slowly the opera seemed to get as long as the Rhine. It was like taking a boat through the music, stopping now and again to savor a well-wrought leitmotif or gape at unusual sights along the way. For instance, those stupid giants, Fafner and Fasolt (Aage Haugland and John Macurdy, both amusingly dim), who thomped in on platform shoes to collect their pay from Wotan for building Valhalla on spec. It takes hours of argument before they see any gold.    We will hear the surviving Fafner again soon enough when the Met stages &quot;Siegfried&quot; this spring, by which time he will have transformed himself into a mean dragon to better guard his horde of gold. Wagner regarded the accumulation of capital with a baleful eye unless it was accumulating in his own bank account.    ---   Compared with the Met's enormous Franco Zeffirelli-designed &quot;Turandot,&quot; the production of the same Puccini chinoiserie at the New York City Opera by Beni Montresor is so teensy that a sturdy diva could wear it as a headdress. But new singers and a splendid conductor turned it into big league last Sunday.    With the most modest podium deportment, Florentine conductor Elio Boncompagni urged the orchestra through a performance of rare vitality and coloristic range. And beyond that miracle, he communicated smoothly with chorus and soloists, taking particular care with the Turandot (Gail Tremitiere, making her debut here).    She was an impressive ice princess with her big voice, powerful high Cs, long fingernails and withering glances. A sensible Calaf would have taken the next mule train to Samarkand. But Soviet tenor Vyacheslav Polozov had taken special pains to get on stage and he handily held his own.    Last year, he defected in Japan and has slowly been building a career at the Met, Chicago's Lyric and now at City Opera. He deserves more attention. This is a strong, seamless voice with a gleaming top and a lyrical capacity. But he must take acting lessons. He straddled the stage like someone expecting an earthquake. </TEXT></DOC>
