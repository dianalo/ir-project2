Premium 386/C from AST Research Inc. of Irvine,Calif.; PS/2 Model 80 from IBM of Armonk, N.Y.; and 3Server/500 from 3ComCorp. of Santa Clara, Calif.andM;The survey found minimal differences in buyer satisfaction among the productsin these top three attributes.andP;  However, the differences between the productsin the remaining categories were sizable.andM;According to its buyers, Dell's System 310 came out ahead of the other LANservers, snatching an overall score of 83.andM;The System 310's performance &quot;is outstanding,&quot; said Kevin Diviesta, managerof networks technology for batteries maker Duracell Inc.andP;  &quot;The speed,compatibility and the quality of the components are superior.&quot;andM;Dropping three points behind the Dell system was AST's Premium 386/C, with anoverall score of 80.andM;&quot;While the Dell 310 is a more stable machine for large networks, the AST canhandle a smaller LAN nicely,&quot; said Jim Ross, LAN support administrator forthe Federal Bureau of Reclamation.andM;The PS/2 Model 80 fell in below the AST machine, receiving an overall scoreof 76 from its buyers.andP;  3Com's 3Server/500--the only server that requires aproprietary network operating system--received a score of 70, fully 13 pointsbelow the top-ranked System 310.andM;The Model 80 doesn't measure up as a file server, said one IBM buyer.andP;  &quot;Asfile servers, IBM needs to go back to the drawing board [with the Model 80],&quot;he said.andP;  &quot;We've been unable to maintain disk duplexing while runningNetWare--we've also received general protection interrupts with thehardware.&quot;andM;Buyers of the 3Com 3Server/500 told a similar story.andP;  &quot;[With 3Com] we've hada lot of problems with redirector errors,&quot; said John Stimson, coordinator ofeducational planning for Dade County Public Schools.andP;  &quot;There is someinability within the system to undergo change.&quot;andM;Both the Dell and AST units received high scores from buyers in disk-drivecompatibility and board-level expandability.andP;  On the other hand, buyers citedcompatibility problems with both the IBM and 3Com units.andP;  In hardwarecompatibility, a whopping 26-point gap exists between the top-ranked Dell andthe lowest-ranked 3Com.andM;&quot;[With 3Com] if you want to expand, you have to go with the proprietaryhardware, which is overpriced,&quot; said Hal Brooks, a computer systems analystfor the U.S.andP;  Department of Commerce.andM;Ron Metzger, planning analyst for a large insurance company, agreed.andP;  &quot;Beingproprietary is a big limitation.andP;  [3Server/500's] compatibility withcommunications boards is limited due to slot restriction.andP;  It does come withEthernet built in, but you can't add more cards,&quot; he claimed.andM;IBM buyers, meanwhile, said their compatibility problems with the Model 80concerned its Micro Channel architecture.andM;&quot;My main complaint with the Model 80 is the [lack of] availability of MicroChannel products,&quot; said Michael Homlant, a systems analyst for the WilliamBelamont Hospital.andP;  &quot;I bought a 1-gigabyte WORM drive that wasn't compatibleand couldn't find an external SCSI that would support 600M bytes for MicroChannel.&quot;andM;According to IBM buyer George Antochy, a computer systems analyst for afederal agency, &quot;There is no third-party market lending itself to MicroChannel.andP;  After trying to upgrade to a larger hard disk, we gave up andbought an Everex 386.&quot;andM;Buyers mentioned no compatibility problems with the top-ranked Dell and ASTsystems.andM;A buyer from an insurance company called the Dell 310 &quot;a universal system,compatible with six to eight different types of boards and disk drives.andP;  Wehaven't found anything that isn't compatible.&quot;andM;David West, manager of computer services for Random Lengths Publishing, foundAST's board compatibility outstanding.andP;  &quot;We use a number of add-onboards--5251 emulation boards, GammaLink fax boards, Novell and WesternDigital network boards with no problems,&quot; he said.andM;Coming in behind the top three traits in importance to buyers was quality ofdocumentation.andP;  Overall, buyers of all four products were not especiallysatisfied with the quality of documentation.andM;&quot;The documentation is never as good as it could be,&quot; said Tom O'Brien, asoftware specialist for the U.S.andP;  Postal Service and a Dell System 310 user.andO;&quot;If the company's documentation is on paper, they're behind the times.&quot;andM;Dell's documentation was ranked highest by buyers in clarity of documentationand completeness and organization of documentation.andP;  The Dell manual &quot;isclear and concise,&quot; said Duracell's Diviesta.andP;  &quot;I don't have to take a lot oftime to search through it.&quot;andM;Buyers of IBM's PS/2 Model 80 found that the product's lack of documentationhindered installation.andM;&quot;There is no documentation,&quot; said systems analyst Antochy.andP;  &quot;When you don'tget respectable documentation, it's hard to put together a LAN server.&quot;andM;Buyers of the 3Com 3Server/500 found that product's documentation to bepoorly organized.andP;  &quot;You don't get the whole picture unless you read all 15manuals,&quot; said the Department of Commerce's Brooks.andM;Although value relative to cost was one of the lowest-ranked attributes, itis still an issue for some buyers.andP;  &quot;You can't compare just pure performanceper dollar--you have to take into account hidden costs such as labor, ease ofuse and downtime,&quot; said William Belamont Hospital's Homlant.andM;Dell and AST were once again the top finishers in this category, while IBMand 3Com were matched closely for lowest scores.andM;&quot;From an administrator's point of view, 3Com is a real bear,&quot; said JohnJabusch, a computer scientist for the Army Corps of Engineers.andP;  &quot;It takestwice the time to support 25 people with 3Com as it would take for Novell.&quot;andM;&quot;As a file server [the Model 80's] value is zero,&quot; said one IBM buyer whoasked not to be identified.andP;  &quot;It doesn't function properly and should only beused as a workstation.&quot;andM;By contrast, AST buyer West of Random Lengths Publishing said the Premium386/C is an exceptional value.andP;  &quot;It is particularly good compared with theCompaq and IBM [servers],&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;In the end, it's the user/networkresponse that's important.andP;  With AST, there's never a significant delay.&quot;andM;Dell buyers said the System 310's value is related to the vendor's customersupport.andP;  &quot;It's excellent,&quot; said Stuart Beckett, project manager for networkdealer Burkey and Associates Inc.andP;  &quot;Dell will be around.andP;  You know they'renot going out of business.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
