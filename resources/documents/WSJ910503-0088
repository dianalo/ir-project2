The ruling, handed down Wednesday by the federal appealscourt in New Orleans, affirmed that federal law takesprecedence over state law in disputes involving insurancecoverage under employee health plans. Texas is the only statethat has attempted to tax the plans.</LP><TEXT>   The challenge to the Texas tax was brought by some of thestate's biggest companies, who feared that the tax on theiremployee health plans would eventually force them to cutemployee benefits. The tax was enacted in 1987 to help offsetshortfalls in state funds.   The companies, including La Quinta Motor Inns Inc.,E-Systems Inc. and Kimberly-Clark Corp., contended that thestate tax violated federal protections for employee benefitplans under the Employees' Retirement Income Security Act,known as ERISA. The companies' position was upheld by U.S.District Judge James R. Nowlin of Austin, Texas. The stateappealed, arguing that the federal Tax Injunction Actprohibits federal courts from interfering with any state taxwhen the dispute can be litigated in a state court.   The federal appeals court in New Orleans rejected thestate's argument, saying that the broad federal powers underERISA would prohibit a state court from hearing this taxdispute.   The companies' lawyers, Steven J. Sacher and William B.McClure of the Dallas law firm Johnson andamp; Gibbs, said theappeals court ruling could discourage other states thatconsidered imposing a tax on employee benefit plans. &quot;This isa reaffirmation of the sweep of the ERISA pre-emption rules,&quot;Mr. Sacher said.   The appeals court ordered the state to reimburse thecompanies for the taxes they paid under protest. Thecompanies involved in the case decided on Wednesday had paidabout $1.7 million, and other companies involved in separatechallenges had paid about $10 million, according to Messrs.Sacher and McClure. It wasn't clear whether these additionalchallenges would be resolved by the appeals court decisionbecause certain other issues were involved.   ---   COMPUTER-GAME MAKER sues U.S. government over office raid.   Steve Jackson Games Inc. of Austin, Texas, claimed thegovernment violated the Constitution during a raid on itsoffice. The suit raises new questions about how the Bill ofRights applies to new technology.   U.S. Secret Service agents last year searched the gameconcern's office and seized several computers, including abulletin-board system called &quot;Illuminati,&quot; the suit says. Aswith other such systems, PC buffs used the Illuminati boardto exchange electronic messages from terminals around thecountry.   The suit, filed late Wednesday in federal court in Austin,contends electronic bulletin boards are a new form ofcommunications that should enjoy constitutional protectionssimilar to those given to printing presses and telephones.The suit contends that the investigators in the Jackson casedidn't meet the narrow legal standards for seizinginstruments of speech.   The Jackson case has become the central battleground in amounting debate over computer crime and the Constitution. Thethreat of hackers, viruses, and other electronic menaces isgrowing as computer networks proliferate. But some civillibertarians argue that law-enforcers are casting too wide anet for computer crooks, and snaring innocent PC users andcommon high-tech practices.   The Jackson suit names as defendants the Secret Serviceand two of its agents, Chicago assistant U.S. AttorneyWilliam Cook, and Henry Kluepfel, an official at thephone-industry research organization Bellcore. The suit saidMr. Kluepfel worked with law enforcers in the Jackson case.   Officials at the Secret Service, the Chicago U.S.attorney's office, and Bellcore all refused to comment on thesuit. A Secret Service spokesman said the agency iscontinuing its investigation of a Jackson employee, which ledto last year's raid.   According to the suit, law enforcers seized drafts of aJackson book called &quot;GURPS Cyberpunk,&quot; which a Secret Serviceagent called &quot;a handbook for computer crime.&quot; The suitmaintains the book is part of a fantasy-game series. The tinyAustin game company has won the backing of several prominentcivil-liberties lawyers, and the Electronic FrontierFoundation, a new computer-users' rights group backed byhigh-tech entrepreneurs.   Some legal scholars think the Jackson case could clarifysome important murky questions about searches and computers.&quot;This would be something of a first,&quot; says Laurence Tribe, aHarvard constitutional law professor. &quot;The case presents anopportunity to see just how far courts are willing to extendthe protections of the First and Fourth Amendments toinformation-related material.&quot;   ---   MANDATORY AIDS TESTING by doctors prohibited in New York.   Doctors in New York state were denied the right to ordertesting of patients they suspect are infected with HIV, thevirus that causes AIDS. The New York Court of Appeals, thestate's highest court, ruled that mandatory testing would bedetrimental to efforts to combat acquired immune deficiencysyndrome.   The decision is likely to be cited in court battles inother states, as AIDS-patient advocates fight similar effortscalling for mandatory testing. Earlier this week, forinstance, the Medical Society of New Jersey called fortesting of all hospital patients.   In 1988, the New York State Medical Society and otherdoctors' groups sued the state's health commissioner for theright to order testing whenever a doctor viewed itappropriate. The doctors argued that HIV infection should beincluded under state public-health laws that require testingand reporting of the infection to sexual partners orneedle-sharing partners.   But the appeals court ruled in favor of the public healthcommissioner, who claimed the request would discourage peoplefrom voluntarily seeking HIV testing and treatment.   &quot;Intravenous drug users, who make up an ever increasingpercentage of new AIDS cases, are engaged in behavior whichis illegal and there is little reason to believe they willcooperate with health authorities in identifying their needlesharing contacts,&quot; the court said. &quot;Similar disincentivesexist for homosexuals and others at risk of HIV infectionbecause disclosure can result in discrimination in housing,employment and health care.&quot;   Don Moy, general counsel for the New York State MedicalSociety, said, &quot;The Court of Appeals decision ends thislawsuit, but it doesn't end the public debate on this issue.. . . The next appropriate step is the legislature.&quot; He saidseveral bills are pending that would allow doctors to requireHIV testing.   ---   MILKEN PROSECUTOR to lead U.S. Attorney's securities-fraudunit.
