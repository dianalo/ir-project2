Natural gas prices sank to $1.23 a thousand cubic feet byearly April compared with $1.39 a year earlier, according toa composite price published by Howard Weil. More serious thanthe year-to-year decline was this year's early fall-off inprices. Normally, demand declines, taking prices lower, astemperatures rise. But last winter was so warm and short inmuch of the country that prices hit rock bottom severalmonths earlier than usual, didn't rise as high as theprevious year and didn't remain at the peak as long.   As a result, &quot;the market is in disarray and the price is adisaster,&quot; said James Paul, chief executive officer ofCoastal Corp., a Houston energy company.   The depressed prices not only reduced earnings forproducers but also crushed their optimism. Many felt evenbefore the Persian Gulf crisis that prices would come out ofthe slump they've been in since the mid-1980s. The Clean Airact and other initiatives would boost gas demand because it'sa cleaner burning fuel, they figured. In addition, companieshadn't been replacing their reserves, which many thoughtwould cause a supply crunch.   But the warm winter, one in a series of mild winters,curbed demand. So has the recession. Price competition becamefierce for what sales were available. And demand sparked bythe environmental advantages of gas has yet to be seen.   &quot;We've had six years of warm winters,&quot; complained GlennCox, president of Phillips Petroleum Co., whose U.S. reservesare 57% gas. &quot;Gas prices will continue to lag&quot; behind thisyear, he said. The company forecasts the average price itreceives for selling gas will fall this year to $1.55 athousand cubic feet, down from $1.68 in 1990 and 25 centsless than Phillips was predicting just a few months ago.   Many companies have postponed gas drilling because theysee no reason to produce and sell gas at today's break-evenor money-losing prices. Mobil is developing only 65% of thegas projects it had planned in the U.S., Mr. Hoenmans said.   In the Eastern U.S., gas drilling is &quot;dormant,&quot; saidLester Coleman, executive vice president, finance, foroil-service company Halliburton Co. of Dallas. Over the pastfew weeks the company has laid off about 100 workers in thatarea, he said.   Louisiana Land andamp; Exploration Co., a large NewOrleans-based independent, said reduced gas prices and cashflow prompted the company to lower its capital spending plansto $250 million this year from $290 million. AnadarkoPetroleum Corp. of Houston has reduced spending plans in lockstep with falling gas prices, starting at $280 million, thencutting the budget to $240 million and now to $210 million.   The reduction can be seen in the weekly rig count, whichfell to 881 in the latest week, 6% lower than it was at thispoint last year. The count is also down from 910 the previousweek, at a time of year when activity usually starts edgingup because of seasonal factors.   Many companies have scaled back their gas production byshutting in wells, in effect turning them off. Sonat Inc. ofBirmingham, Ala., in February began a three-week economicreview of its more than 4,000 wells and has wound upcurtailing 11% of its output, said Ronald Kuehn, chairman.&quot;We don't expect any dramatic improvement in gas prices thisyear,&quot; he said.   Mobil has shut in about 250 million cubic feet of gas aday, roughly 10% of its production capacity. Coastal reducesgas sales when prices fall below $1.50, Mr. Paul said. Thecompany currently is producing just half its capacity of 220million cubic feet a day. Anadarko said it is shutting inabout half its capacity of 630 million cubic feet.   The low price raises thorny issues. &quot;Short-term it's abargain for consumers,&quot; said Kenneth Lay, chairman of gascompany Enron Corp. &quot;Long-term it could be really costly.&quot;   Mr. Lay and other independent gas producers argue thatexplorers can't drill for new reserves based on such low gasprices and that down the road there will be supply problemsand prices will spike upward. &quot;We'll find ourselves back inthe days of shortages like in the 1970s,&quot; said Coastal's Mr.Paul.   In fact, a battle is already brewing between the major oilcompanies and the smaller independents. The smaller companiescharge that the major companies continue to sell all theirnatural gas at such low prices in part to drive independentsout of business. In many cases gas is being sold by all kindsof producers below replacement cost.   Overall, the mood at this big energy conference is one ofresignation by many executives and investors who depend ongas. A joke making its way around has a gas producer askingGod when prices will finally rise. &quot;Not in my lifetime,&quot; Godreplies.</TEXT></DOC>
