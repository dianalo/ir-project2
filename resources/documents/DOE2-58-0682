MRI is performed using a TOSHIBA MRT-15A resistive magneticsystem, which is capable of spin-echo (SE) and inversion-recovery (IR)images with a slice thickness of 10 mm. The visualized anatomical regionof the head were recorded on the films in the constant slice intervals.Image data were taken by using a TV-camera, and digitized into 256 graylevels at an 512 x 512 array of points. By the region segmentation, theboundaries of the pituitary gland, ventricles and brains were extracted.And the boundaries of the pituitary gland at 7 sagittal sections and2 axial sections were displayed three-dimensionally. As a result of thisstudy, the following conclusions were obtained. (1) The boundaries ofthe brain tumor, ventricles and brain were precisely extracted by imageprocessing techniques. (2) Making use of this method, we may be ableto obtain valuable diagnostic and physiologic information.</TEXT></DOC>
