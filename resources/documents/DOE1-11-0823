Foamed plastics, mineral materials and naturalmaterials are at present available for the thermal insulation of buildings.Although thermal insulation materials are subject to quality controlstheir labels do not inform about the material composition of the products.Healthy and ecological building construction, however, cannot dispensewith data informing about the chemical additives contained in the bondingagents (formation of gases or fine dusts). The paper discusses a numberof problems builders have been confronted with so far in practice. Theproblems explained refer to vapour seals (formation of perspiration waterand mould fungi, broken glass fibers coming off as dusts) as well asto polystyrene (noxious styrene split-offs) and to cork as a naturalinsulation material (baked cork plates have an unpleasant, although volatilesmell, gases are released). From the bio-constructional point of viewsynthetic insulation materials are highly noxious, isolating man fromhis natural environment. (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
