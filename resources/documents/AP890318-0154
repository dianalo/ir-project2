The city's soaring number of murders _ 114 as of Friday, withmany of them drug-related _ has prompted talk on Capitol Hill by twosenators that perhaps the local police department should be replacedwith a federally controlled police force. District officials haveexpressed fear that they may lose control over their city.   But Bennett said in an interview, ``We have no plan to displacethe Washington, D.C., Police Department, which I actually think hasdone pretty well. I think Chief (Maurice) Turner's made valiantefforts here.''   On Monday, the day Bennett was sworn in as the nation's firstdirector of national drug control policy, he told a news conferencethat in the next few weeks he may declare Washington, recentlybecoming known as the nation's murder capital, a ``high intensitydrug trafficking area.'' Such a designation would allow him toallocate federal personnel and cash to combat the problem.   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., on Thursday blamed the city's crimewave on ``inept local government that doesn't understand what it'sdoing'' and said that if the killing continues he will considertaking ``a look at home rule, at least the law enforcement aspect.''Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., supported Rudman's remarks.   City officials worried aloud that home rule, the right toself-governance that city residents obtained in 1973, may be morevulnerable now than ever before.   ``If the federal government thinks it can do a better job ofstopping drugs from coming into the city, why can't they do a betterjob of stopping drugs from entering the country?'' asked MayorMarion Barry Jr.   Bennett said Friday, ``I certainly don't think we're going tosolve this problem by taking over from the city.''   ``Our effort ... will not be to say D.C. is no more and we'retaking it over,'' he said. ``It will be to say, `We're going tohelp. We'd like to get in and help and get out.'''   In the long run, Bennett said, ``what's going to sustainWashington is not going to be federal agencies or drug czars. It'sgoing to be its own people, their neighborhoods, their communities,their governments. They've got to stand on their own feet, run theirown community. They have to take back the streets. ... We might beable to help in the interim.''</TEXT></DOC>
