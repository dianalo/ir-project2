After President Bush'smasterful handling of the Persian Gulf, leaders of theDemocratic Party should take their own lesson by asking, WhenAmerican voters wonder whom they can trust to run foreignpolicy, why can't they have more than one party to choosefrom?   Since Vietnam, the accepted wisdom among nationallyprominent Democrats is that the use of force is always thefinal option, but somehow an option whose time never comes.So long as this view defines their party, Democrats who hopeone day to serve as Commander in Chief will have thecredibility problem symbolized by the video of MichaelDukakis in a tank.</LP><TEXT>   Indeed, unless the party begins to switch gears, voterswill surely remember at the next election how close thecongressional vote was to approve President Bush's decisionto use force against Iraq. &quot;Iraq is isolated and sufferingfrom the embargo, and time is on our side,&quot; Sam Nunn arguedone month ago. Senate Majority Leader Mitchell led therefrain that &quot;There has been no clear rationale, noconvincing explanation for shifting American policy from oneof sanctions to one of war.&quot; In the end, the Senate voteapproving force was a close 52 to 47, with but 10 Democratssupporting force and only Al Gore among presidentialaspirants.   To its credit, the congressional leadership held a vote onthis defining issue. During the rather serious congressionaldebate in January, they made their best arguments that SaddamHussein would eventually be persuaded by sanctions anddiplomacy. The Democrats' central problem here is that theirposition is now seen to be so obviously wrong. Scuds, humanshields, oil spills and the salting of Kuwait taught theworld that nothing less than brutal bombardments andoverpowering ground strength would impress Saddam. Just atthe time so many voices were arguing that U.N. resolutionswould be sufficient, Iraqi torturers were hooking up Kuwaiticivilians to electrocution devices.   A few congressional Democrats such as Stephen Solarzemerged early as eloquent spokesmen for the use of force. Butwhy was he so alone? If enough like-minded Democrats comeforward in the post-Persian Gulf era, perhaps Les Aspin canfinally get a pro-defense caucus in the House to offerbalance against the anti-Pentagon clique.   There is a precedent: Democrats have the opportunity tolearn from the mistakes of the generation of isolationistRepublicans who earlier in this century clung too long to apinched view of American interests and capabilities.   Just as support for the war was bipartisan when it finallycame, there is more than the electoral interests of theDemocrats at stake in the proposal that they accept that themilitary is something other than pork and waste, fraud andabuse. The country would be the greatest beneficiary of a newdomestic order rooted in clear support for a strong U.S. rolein the world. There is sufficient room to debate the details.
