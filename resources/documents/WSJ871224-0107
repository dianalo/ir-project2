Wachtel in the end-of-year issue of The Nation:    American banks are required to set aside 20 cents as a reserve for every dollar deposited with them inside the United States. Eurodollar accounts, however, are not subject to such reserve set-asides. The full dollar can be lent out, raising the theoretical possibility of unlimited dollar creation. The total value of Eurodollars in circulation has grown at a rate of about 25 percent a year since the mid-1970s, compared with a growth of real trade of only 4 percent annually. By comparison, the total number of U.S. dollars has grown only 10 percent a year. Starting from a base of about $50 billion in 1973, the &quot;stateless&quot; Eurodollar system today is approaching $2 trillion, almost as large as the domestic monetary system of the United States, which comes under Federal Reserve and Treasury regulatory authority. It is as if we have been transported back to an earlier century, when private bank money operated around and in spite of government. </TEXT></DOC>
