Robert M. White, president of the National Academy ofEngineering, said these are among measures needed to prevent furtherbuild-up of greenhouse gases that could be responsible for globalwarming.   White and three other witnesses cautioned that scientists stilldo not know whether burning of fossil fuels and other humanactivities will cause significant temperature changes, leading toheat waves and drought.   One witness, University of Virginia professor Patrick J.Michaels, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee it would bemore prudent to await more study before making drastic policydecisions.   ``Our policy should be commensurate with the state of ourscientific knowledge,'' the professor of environmental sciences toldthe energy and power subcommittee.   Michaels said climate experts have a ``clouded vision'' of futureglobal warming, and added, ``basing sweeping environmental policy''on such uncertainties ``is especially risky, even if the policy isotherwise rational.''   The greenhouse effect occurs when gases in Earth's atmospheretrap radiant heat near the planet's surface _ the more gases, themore heat.   The gases are more transparent to incoming solar energy than theyare to outgoing infrared energy.   In addition to natural build-up, greenhouse gases have increasedbecause of human activities, including burning of fossil fuels,coal, oil, and gas; and destruction of tropical rain forests.   The problem comes in trying to predict what will happen in thefuture. Projections are now made by scientists using mathematicalmodels that are only approximations of the real atmosphere.   White told the panel not to wait for more study to take action,suggesting, ``we can intervene through more efficient use of fossilfuels and incentives to use those that contribute least to thecarbon dioxide building per thermal unit.   ``For example, shifts from coal to natural gas, as well asintensified efforts to develop no-fossil energy sources such aspassively safe and publicly acceptable nuclear power are desirable.   ``We can work with other nations to reduce tropicaldeforestation. These actions should slow the climate warming.''   Dr. Stephen Schneider, a scientist for the National Center forAtmospheric Research, in Boulder, Colo., agreed with White thataction was needed now as ``insurance against catastrophic change.''   ``It's a question of what kind of risks do you want to take withthe planet,'' he said.   Dr. Daniel L. Albritton, of the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration, said even after more is learned about the greenhouseeffect on global warming, lawmakers still might not be able to learnhow the trend would affect their own regions.
