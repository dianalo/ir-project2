The interruption in the arms flow from China was only one strandin a complex web of events that has stalemated the Afghan war sixmonths after guerrillas forced the Soviets to end a nine-yearoccupation, say administration and congressional sources.   The United States has been sending the Afghan guerrillas about$600 million in arms a year since 1986, purchasing many of them fromChina, which shipped them to Pakistan for rail transport toPeshawar, a border town where seven major resistance parties arebased.   Saudi Arabia has been buying the guerrillas a smaller amount ofarms, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Following the crackdown on pro-democracy forces in China, theChinese ``came to us and said our rail shipments are beingdisrupted,'' said one source. ``We weren't sure whether that wastrue or they were mad because the United States was supporting thedemocratic movement there.''   At about the same time, the CIA and its Pakistani counterpart,the Inter-Service Intelligence, cut the flow of arms to Afghanparties based in Peshawar.   ``They were fine-tuning the pipeline,'' one source said, seekingto decrease arms supplies to the lackluster Afghan InterimGovernment, based in Peshawar, and send them directly to guerrillasinside Afghanistan.   Officials at the CIA and other agencies also badly miscalculatedthe amount of aid the Kremlin was sending to the Najibullah regimein Kabul, and misjudged the ability of that government to cling topower, sources said.   The head of the CIA covert aid program to Afghanistan has beenshifted to other duties, and although he has not been reprimanded,has been ``cast as a scapegoat'' for the faltering U.S. policy, saidone administration source.   Since the Red Army pulled out in February, sources said, Moscowhas been sending an estimated $250 million to $300 million in armsper month to Kabul, about five times the level of aid going to theanti-communist guerrillas.   The guerrillas, at the urging of Pakistani intelligence, began anassault against Jalalabad, a major administrative center in easternAfghanistan.   But the offensive sputtered because the supply of arms to theguerrillas dropped off sharply, and because of infighting among theseven parties based in Peshawar, said the U.S. sources.   The U.S. government, while maintaining support for the AfghanInterim Government, has cut the supply of arms to the Peshawarparties by half, sending the remainder directly to guerrilla leadersinside Afghanistan.   ``We need to get the stuff directly to the people who are doingthe fighting,'' said one source.   The policies of the CIA, and the Bush administration in general,have come under fierce attack from members of Congress, who havevoted large amounts of money for the Afghan resistance and expectedvictory over the Kremlin-backed regime.   ``The CIA has secretly pursued a wrong-headed Afghan policy foryears,'' the chairman of the Republican Task Force on Terrorism andUnconventional Warfare wrote in an opinion piece that appearedSunday in the Washington Post.   The congressman, Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., said the worstblunder was allowing Pakistani intelligence to give most of U.S.,Saudi and Chinese arms shipments to the Hezbi-i-Islami, the partyheaded by Gulbadin Hekmatyar, one of the seven resistance leadersbased in Peshawar.   As it shifted the flow of supplies from Hekmatyar and the otherPeshawar-based resistance parties, the Bush administration was alsodeveloping ties with the last king of Afghanistan, Mohammad ZahirShah, who was deposed in 1974 and lives in Rome.   ``Talking with the king is not a shift in policy,'' said oneadministration official. But it is part of a wider strategy to finda way to breathe life into the faltering Afghan resistance.</TEXT></DOC>
