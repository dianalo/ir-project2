Meanwhile, the French franc gained against the German mark, easing pressure for a realignment of currencies within the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.    While the dollar may be able to add to yesterday's gains, in the longer run it is expected to remain weak. And despite yesterday's developments, a realignment of the EMS currencies is considered inevitable.    &quot;I don't think they (the German central bank) feel, or the market feels, that the dollar's decline is over yet,&quot; said James T. McGroarty, vice president of foreign exchange at Discount Corp. of New York. &quot;Nobody is advocating that this is the bottom.&quot;    Traders said the dollar purchases by the Bundesbank, the German central bank, were relatively small, between $100 million and $200 million, and occurred in European markets after New York trading was under way.    In late New York dealings yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.9303 marks, up from 1.9240 Friday. Shortly before the Bundesbank intervention reportedly began, the dollar touched its intraday low of 1.9173 marks. Minutes later, the U.S. unit was trading at 1.9350 marks, its high for the day.    The Bundesbank &quot;scared a lot of people out of their short (dollar) positions,&quot; said Martin S. Rieben, vice president and chief dealer at Union Bank of Switzerland, New York.    Some traders, while acknowledging a bearish long-term outlook for the dollar, said a brief rally for the U.S. currency wouldn't be surprising. They noted that the dollar's drop from the 2.00-mark level occurred during the year-end holiday period, when trading was extremely light and major economic news was inconclusive. &quot;Going back up to 2.01 (marks) shouldn't be that difficult,&quot; said Audrey A. McNiff, a trader at Irving Trust Co., New York.    The dollar also rose to 159.25 Japanese yen yesterday, from 158.55.    The British pound fell sharply, on the release of a public-opinion poll that showed support for the ruling Conservative Party falling to 39%, or near parity with the opposition Labor Party, which received 38% backing. Late in New York, the pound stood at $1.4710, down 1.2% from $1.4885 Friday.    In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday the dollar fell against the Japanese currency to 158.98 yen from 159.25 in New York yesterday afternoon.    Dealers speculated that the primary aim of the Bundesbank's dollar purchases yesterday was to weaken the mark within the EMS, a joint float of eight currencies. The mark's strength, especially against the French franc, eventually is expected to trigger a realignment of the EMS currencies.    The franc has been hurt by perceptions of a weakening French government amid a series of strikes and the recent abortive attempt to reform the country's university system.    Reversing the recent trend, the mark fell to 3.3069 francs at yesterday's foreign-exchange fixing in Paris, from a record 3.3120 francs Friday. Under the current EMS structure, the mark isn't allowed to rise above 3.3303 francs.    The Bank of France continued to boost French interest rates to support the franc. The central bank raised its seven-day securities repurchase rate to 8 3/4% from 8 1/4%, which was widely expected following the bank's Friday increase in its money-market intervention rate, to 8% from 7 1/4%.    The seven-day repurchase rate is the level at which the central bank lends to commercial banks against securities. The money-market intervention rate applies to central bank injections of liquidity into the money market. The two rates generally form a framework for rates on overnight lending between banks.    Traders estimate French interest rates are now 3 1/2 percentage points above comparable West German rates, compared with a spread of only 1 1/2 points shortly before Christmas. Higher interest rates help boost a currency by making investments denominated in the currency more attractive.    Besides raising their interest rates, the French have been pressing West Germany for a revaluation of the mark to ease pressure on the franc. West Germany is expected to agree to a revaluation, but not until after the Jan. 25 national election.    An increase in the mark's value against the franc would help slow West German monetary growth by shutting off the recent speculative investment in the mark in anticipation of a revaluation. West German officials have voiced persistent concern about the possible inflationary impact of continued above-target monetary growth.    But a stronger mark would be unpopular in West Germany because it would make the country's exports less competitive. West German farmers are said to be particularly sensitive to such a development, and the government is not expected to risk losing their votes by acting before the election.    Analysts expect the mark's value against the franc to be increased by about 4%.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold for current delivery rose $1 an ounce to $402.90 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 3.1 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $402.75 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                        CURRENCY RATES                          New York    Home Mkt.
