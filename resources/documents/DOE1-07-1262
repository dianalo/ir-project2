On theCT also other pathological findings were detected in the brain apartfrom calcifications. (Similarly as in 25% of the AIDS syndrome whereaffections of the CNS are not yet known.) Based on the authors'experienceand data from abroad, CT examination of the brain can be recommendedas very useful for the confirmation of the diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosisalso with regard to the prognosis of further psychomotoric developmentof the child.
