Ceramic coatings are of particularinterest because of the substantial improvements in engine efficiencywhich are achieved through increases in turbine inlet temperature. Correspondingadvantages result from use of thermal barrier coatings in diesel engines.The performance and durability of a ceramic coating are determined bythe inherent properties of the coating material and the nature of themicrostructure which results from processing of the coating. Althoughprogress has been made in the former area (i.e. understanding of compositioneffects, optimization of microstructure, and development of new coatingchemistries), the more significant advances of the past decade have probablyinvolved process automation. A fully automated plasma spray cell coatingproduction system, for example, is currently being operated by the USAir Force at the San Antonio Air Logistic Center, and process qualificationfor selected engine components has been achieved. The successful implementationof this system contributes to the data and experience base for transferof thermal barrier coating technology to diesel engine applications.</TEXT></DOC>
