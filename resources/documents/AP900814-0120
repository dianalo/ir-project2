(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thousands of times each day, awhite-tailed deer comes nose to grille with a motor vehicle, oftenwith disastrous results.   And not just to the deer, though as many as 350,000 deer dieeach year on America's roads. Last year, 131 people died incollisions with animals, and damages and the costs of cleaning uptotal in the millions of dollars.   Wildlife and highway officials say there's no simple way to keepthe creatures and man from colliding on the nation's roads.   A growing deer population _ there are now 16 million to 18million white-tailed deer in the United States and Canada _ and``human sprawl'' are forcing traffic engineers and wildlifeofficials to seek ways to keep the animals off the road.   ``It's a fairly severe problem, particularly if it's your carthat's been hit,'' said Richard McCabe of the Wildlife ManagementInstitute in Washington, D.C.   ``The problem is that with concentrated deer populations,particularly in states like Pennsylvania and northern Wisconsinthat are semimountainous, you have highways that intersect travelroutes of deer,'' he said.   In West Virginia, the death rate grew from 2,660 deer in 1979 to6,326 in 1989. The typical animal that was struck caused about$1,300 in damage, said Roger Russell of the state Division ofHighways.   Pennsylvania, which has a deer population of more than 1.5million, spends about $8 million each year to collect dead deer offthe roads, said state Game Commission spokesman Ted Godshall.   Game officers picked up more than 40,000 deer carcasses from thehighways last year; they are given to needy families, fed to fishor buried.   ``I know that it takes a minimum of two hours to pick up a deer,and they usually have to drive 50 miles or more,'' Godshall said.``It can take two or three hours of an officer's time. It's atremendous bill.''   The remedies for road kills are varied. Among them is morecareful planning of where roads go; re-examination of grasses andshrubs planted along roads; dispensing with salt as a way ofridding roads of ice, because deer like salt; and more warningsigns.   Colorado and Pennsylvania are considering rerouting deer overand under major thoroughfares, McCabe said. This seems ``to havesome benefits, but of course deer populations can change,'' hesaid. ``Underpasses and overpasses are fairly expensivepropositions if you don't know whether the deer are going to move.''   Fences, by all accounts the most effective remedy, also areexpensive, costing as much as $200,000 a mile. A more recentsolution, wildlife warning reflectors, costs $7,000 per mile.   ``The reflectors light up and set up an unnatural moving lightpattern, which scares the deer,'' said John Strieter, president ofStrieter Corp., which sells the reflectors. ``We don't know what'sgoing on in the deer's head, but eyewitnesses say the deer reactwith them and change directions.''   In Minnesota, the reflectors are being used at 30 sites, with adozen more to be added. Susan Mulvihill, accident surveillancesafety engineer for the state Department of Transportation, saidthey seem to be working.   ``When we figure out a benefit cost, we use 60 percent reductionas an average, so they're pretty effective if you install themright,'' Mulvihill said. ``We've had pretty good luck with themhere. It's worked better than anything else we tried.''   But the high cost and mixed results at a two-mile test-stripalong Interstate 79 have made West Virginia officials skeptical.   ``It is fairly expensive and it isn't 100 percent effective inreducing deer kill ...,'' Russell said. ``The only thing that is100 percent effective is an 8-foot tall fence.''   Whistles attached to vehicles to frighten deer by emittinghigh-pitched sounds also have shown limited effectiveness, McCabesaid.   ``I don't hold much credence in it at all,'' he said. ``It mayscare off deer that are standing in the roads, but it doesn't domuch for those out of the periphery of the sounds that are runningalong the highway. Those tend to be the deer that are hit anyway.''   ``Everything has been tried, nothing works,'' Godshall said.``Fencing is the best thing, but they're prohibitively expensive.''   The problem, wildlife officials say, is not really with the deerat all. It's people.   ``People are inclined to spread out in attractive areas that arehilly and have forests _ areas that are traditionally andecologically principal and critical habitats of deer and certainlyother wildlife,'' McCabe said.   ``There's more traffic, more miles of travel being done eachyear, and more roadways to accommodate that traffic,'' he said.``What it all comes down to is when a deer bangs into a car, peopletend to get annoyed at the deer, but it's the people who are moreor less invading the deer's habitat, and all of this is aconsequence of human sprawl.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tues PMs, Aug 21</NOTE></DOC>
