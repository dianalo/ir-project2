But it may have only worsened Argentina's broader problem with its military.    A decade after the peak of Argentina's &quot;dirty war&quot; against domestic opposition, the country is still torn between those who think the war was just and those who think military men should be punished for torturing, executing and wrongly arresting thousands of citizens. Some 9,000 to 12,000 people disappeared during the campaign in the mid 1970s.    As soon as two months from now, Argentine courts are due to try the last group of generals still subject to prosecution for alleged human-rights abuses. The proceedings are the last chance to bring military men to civilian justice. So far, in four years of civilian government, seven top military officials have been convicted. Charges were brought against hundreds of others, but prosecutions were halted last year in the face of army restiveness. The argument was that the accused officers had only been acting under orders.    Until last week, when groups of rebellious middle-ranking army officers around the country tried to unseat the army chief of staff, it seemed likely that the few remaining trials would take place. The rebellion was only the latest example of deep divisions within the military.    But now, with most of the rebels in custody and internal divisions newly ironed over, the military seems to have unified around a single position: The trials shouldn't take place, and President Raul Alfonsin's civilian government should send no more generals to jail. Indeed, analysts perceive few ideological differences between the rebels and the army high command that quelled them.    Though Mr. Alfonsin's government was never at risk during the latest rebellion -- indeed, instigator Aldo Rico, a former lieutenant colonel, has said publicly that he didn't want a coup -- the events still put the president in a difficult position. He came to office in 1983 on the promise of swift justice for human-rights abusers.    &quot;I would say the next three of four months will be crucial,&quot; says Vicente Massot, managing editor of La Nueva Provincia, a newspaper known for its military contacts. &quot;Alfonsin came out of the crisis stronger, in part, because any president in the world prefers a unified army and not factions. But what can a unified army that doesn't like Alfonsin do in the future? That's the question.&quot;    Mr. Massot and other analysts believe the military will demand total amnesty for all officials involved in the &quot;dirty war.&quot; And they think the new-found military unity will give officers a better bargaining position, even though polls show that the public, at least in Buenos Aires, the capital, is disgusted with the excesses of military rule that have come to light.    &quot;Amnesty is neither good nor bad, it's inevitable,&quot; says Rosendo Fraga, a political analyst and authority on the Argentine military. &quot;The military conflict in Argentina isn't going to be resolved until there is an amnesty.&quot; Mr. Massot goes even further. He predicts that the military will demand presidential pardons for the seven officials already convicted.    &quot;There's only one solution: to stop the trials,&quot; he says. &quot;It's the only way and its also the only thing that the Radicals (Mr. Alfonsin's party) won't do.&quot;    The military has been restless since Mr. Alfonsin replaced them in power in 1983. The president quickly scheduled human-rights trials, and Congress started drafting a defense law that was supposed to outline what the military could and couldn't do. But neither project has gone very far.    Argentines have been expecting some kind of showdown since Easter weekend of last year, when an army major refused to appear before a civilian court. That sparked a widespread rebellion, and former Lt. Col. Rico was one of two officers held responsible. He was arrested and held in a garrison but continued to have contacts with his many followers.    Meanwhile, Gen. Dante Caridi was made army chief of staff and he started trying to restore discipline. Throughout 1987 there were more cases of indiscipline in the army than in the past 10 years combined.    As time passed, it became clear that many mid-ranking officers were more loyal to the lieutenant colonel than to the general. Cheering Rico followers disrupted several military ceremonies in the fall. And civilians loyal to the lieutenant colonel made a supportive video tape called &quot;Operation Dignity&quot; and aired it on army bases despite a ban by Gen. Caridi.    It was during an attempt to bring the lieutenant colonel under tighter security that he escaped last weekend. He fled to northern Argentina and declared he wouldn't give up without a fight. Then he surrendered.    &quot;Now he is nobody,&quot; says Mr. Massot. </TEXT></DOC>
