The oil field in question is Cusiana, which lies at thefoot of the easternmost range of mountains at the thresholdof Colombia's oil-rich eastern prairies. The projected exportearnings from the find, which may produce 450,000 barrelsdaily, could push Colombia's total oil earnings over $3billion a year. The find could bring, in the words of agovernment report, &quot;a bonanza without precedent in theinternational balances of the country.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Of course, Colombia's economy needn't rely solely on itsmineral wealth. Despite its violent reputation, Colombia isthe safest place in Latin America for foreign investments,according to a 1990 poll by International Investor magazine.The Colombian government has demonstrated its belief in amarket economy by privatizing inefficient state companies,lowering tariffs and easing restrictions on foreigninvestments and dollar imports.   Nevertheless, Colombia still has vestiges of thenot-quite-bygone mercantilist mentality. Constantly changingrules for investment and property rights have confusedinvestors. These rule changes -- together, of course, withthe drug and guerrilla crises -- led to a 40% drop in foreigninvestments in 1990. And such investments will be vital ifthe country is to tap fully the potential of the new oilfind. The problem is that the oil-rights controversy itselfhas come to epitomize the problems associated with theambiguity of laws governing property rights.   The drama began last March, when British Petroleum, aFrench company called Total and a small (and, at that time,nearly bankrupt) U.S. company, Triton, announced that theyhad discovered reserves now estimated at more than twobillion barrels -- the second-largest ever found in theAmericas, after Prudhoe Bay, Alaska.   The price of Triton's shares multiplied 10 times in sixmonths. The multinational oil community -- which, fed up withguerrilla terrorism, had begun withdrawing from jointventures with the state oil company (Ecopetrol) -- beganlining up to buy exploration rights. In the midst of all thiseuphoria, however, 56 upper-class Colombians produced legaldocuments that showed that Cusiana's mineral rights, thoughtto belong to Ecopetrol, belonged, at least in part, to them.   These claims go back to an incident in 1759, when a groupof cattle farmers obtained a land grant from the Spanishcrown for a modest ranch. Through illegal appropriations,this claim grew to almost one million acres. The illegalseizures remained unchallenged for nearly two centuriesuntil, in 1920, an eccentric general with a passion forhistory discovered the fraud, denounced the seizure and wasrewarded with 45% of the property (the part where oil has nowbeen found) by a grateful Colombian government.   Initially the general's gift did not include mineralrights. But in 1937, a local judge ceded the general theserights as they flew over the lands in a DC-3. Since no onewas thinking of oil at the time, the matter aroused littleinterest. But when oil was discovered there in the late1960s, the Colombian Supreme Court and two Colombianpresidents were drawn into the dispute.   The matter was apparently resolved in 1971, whenthen-President Misael Pastrana confirmed the general's claims-- despite a 1969 law that states that mineral rights belongto the nation. On this basis, Ecopetrol entered into royaltyagreements with the general's heirs (and those they had soldland to) when it began drilling in the area in the 1970s.   The owners currently receive about $500,000 annually fromprevious explorations. But if Cusiana lives up toexpectations, their royalties may multiply a hundredfold,even though they are asking for just 4% of Ecopetrol's shareof the profits. In addition to its size, most of the oil inCusiana is high-grade light condensed fuel, which commandshigher prices in international markets than the ordinarycrude. And there are also huge deposits of natural gas.   In October -- in a decision that caused Triton's stock tofall $6 a share -- the Colombian Council of State refused anappeal by the Ministry of Mining and Energy to rule the 1971presidential decree unconstitutional, saying that itshouldn't have waited 20 years before deciding that therights of the state had been violated. A month later itreversed itself and said that there was no time limit incases benefiting the public interest.   Meanwhile, the Colombian state prosecutor announced thatthe current royalty contracts were illegal, and the presidentof Ecopetrol denounced the fact that &quot;this newly discoveredwealth will benefit . . . just 12 rich families.&quot; Even M-19,the former guerrilla group that is now a legal politicalparty, chimed in, announcing that it will sponsor a law toensure the government's exclusive right to Cusiana's oil. TheMining Ministry filed a separate appeal, alleging that themineral rights of the 12 families are invalid because the1969 law limits such claims to the place where drillings hadpreviously been made -- an argument that has led scores oflandowners in surrounding areas to begin poking holes intheir land.   The legal wrangles also caused headaches for Ecopetrol'smultinational partners. Some of their rivals reportedly havecompiled a complete list of the names and phone numbers ofthe 56 claimants. But President Cesar Gaviria personallyassured representatives of BP, Total and Triton that theircontracts remain valid, and Ecopetrol says that no foreigncompany will be permitted to deal behind its back.   While Colombia's new Constitution theoretically gives thestate the right to expropriate any lands for a publicutility, this might be considered a dangerous precedent forarbitrary state action. What the government may do in the endis negotiate the royalties of the families down to a morereasonable level -- one that will placate public opinion,reassure the capitalists and satisfy the landowners. And itcould always tax their royalties, if it wished. What's clearis that Colombia must establish clear rules for propertyrights and stick to them.   ---   Mr. Weiskopf is a free-lance writer based in Bogota.</TEXT></DOC>
