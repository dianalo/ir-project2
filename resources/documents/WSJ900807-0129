The auto maker, concerned that a contemplatedaccounting-rule change could add a balance-sheet liability of$7 an hour for each employee, has proposed shifting the costof retiree health benefits to a trust representing a numberof employers. Transferring the load to a so-calledmultiemployer trust could spare Chrysler from listing itsretiree health liabilities on its own books, a requirementproposed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board for1993.</LP><TEXT>   The FASB, however, may not look kindly on the Chryslerplan. &quot;We're looking very carefully at tightening thedefinition so companies may not avoid their promise by tryingto structure something that looks like a multiemployer planor smells like one, but isn't,&quot; an FASB official says. TheUnited Auto Workers also might be reluctant to give itsassent, since a multiemployer trust, rather than Chrysler,would be responsible for assuring retiree benefits.   The union is likely to resist unless General Motors Corp.and Ford Motor Co. also join the trust.                                                                                                          MANY OTHER FIRMS push retirees to pay a bigger share ofhealth costs.   Faced with mounting medical-insurance bills and a risingretiree population, as well as the proposed FASB rule, anumber of companies are requiring retired workers to pick upa larger portion of their doctor and hospital bills.Consultant A. Foster Higgins andamp; Co. says a survey of 1,100companies with retiree benefits shows 43% have revised theirrules in the past two years or are planning to do so thisyear.   Fully 28% of the companies are asking retirees to paybigger premiums, 18% are increasing deductibles and 14% arereducing benefits. Employers, moreover, are rewriting thelink between the corporate coverage and Medicare to reducethe company's load for retirees over age 65. But thecost-cutting strategies could backfire, warns Patricia Wilsonof Foster Higgins. Workers could demand raises to offset theexpected boost in health costs when they retire, she says.                                                                                                          LEISURE TOPS WORK as the main focus of Americans. But notexecutives.   For the first time in 15 years of posing the question, theRoper Organization finds 41% of adult Americans put leisureahead of work as &quot;the important thing&quot; in their lives; only36% put work first. Among college students, the pattern iseven stronger. Leisure ranks paramount for 47%; 30% givegreater emphasis to work. In the executive suite, though, thework ethic still rules.   &quot;I view work as my No. 1 priority,&quot; asserts Robert Knox,president of Prudential Capital Venture Management.Marguerite Barnett, the University of Houston's newpresident, allows she thinks about work even while playinggolf. Larry Reburn, a vice president of Sbarro Inc., says heconsiders leisure &quot;equally as important as the satisfaction Iget from work.&quot; Still, he puts in 60 to 70 hours a week athis job. But if other Americans don't share the work drive,Larry Lyons, a GM engineering manager, isn't especiallyconcerned about any loss of international competitiveness.   &quot;Even the Japanese are realizing there are other things todo at night,&quot; Mr. Lyons declares.                                                                                                          DRUG TESTING of job candidates becomes nearly universal atmajor companies. CompuChem Corp. says 96% of the nation's top100 companies screen applicants.                                                                                                          DATA-PROCESSING service firm executives received 6.2% payincreases in 1989 and are expected to get 5.9% boosts boththis year and next, all at least 0.4 percentage point aheadof general industry, consultant William M. Mercer Inc. says.                                                                                                          WELL, MAYBE] To workers who get other job offers, 38% ofemployers say they wouldn't extend a counter bid and 21% saythey would, Management Recruiters International finds. But38% say it all depends.                                                                                                          SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA contractors, under a pact with thecarpenters union, contribute $5 million, at the rate of 18cents for each hour a carpenter works, to promotepoured-in-place concrete construction. The carpenters buildthe concrete forms.                                                                                                          WORKERS COMP SYSTEM clogs access to medical care, a studycontends.   Workers hurt on the job have more trouble getting qualitymedical care than people with comparable injuries fromnonwork accidents, the Massachusetts Workers' CompensationAdvisory Council says. A study for the state group by Lynch,Ryan andamp; Associates and Boylston Group says both sets ofpatients with back injuries can get immediate care. But&quot;difficulty increases&quot; as work victims seek access tospecialists and rehabilitation, the researchers say.   Doctors view compensation cases as less desirable becausethey believe lawyers, insurers and employers interfere,workers aren't motivated, fees are lower and paperwork isburdensome. But the researchers say the other parties havegrievances, too, and all are &quot;convinced the others representthe weak link&quot; in the compensation chain.   Coordinated care and speedier reimbursements could easepatient and doctor complaints, the study suggests.
