The parliament of the break-away republic is scheduled onThursday to begin debating a possible suspension of its March 11declaration of independence that has put it at loggerheads withSoviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Darius Suziedelis of the Lithuanian parliament's InformationBureau, said in a telephone interview that President VytautasLandsbergis and Prime Minister Kazimere Prunskiene were leading asix-member delegation to the Soviet capital.   The delegation also included Deputy Prime Minister RomualdasOzolas and legislative leader Egidius Bickauskas.   Suziedelis said little was known about their agenda in Moscow.But it was unlikely that the group would travel to the Sovietcapital without an understanding that a meeting would be held withtop Soviet officials.   Landsbergis met with Gorbachev on Tuesday morning, and thenreturned to Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital.   He told the Supreme Council parliament upon his return that hereceived a better understanding of what kind of a compromise mightbe acceptable to Gorbachev, and that he might return for more talkswith the Soviet leader.   Mrs. Prunskiene, asking parliament on Tuesday to freeze thedeclaration of independence, told the republic's lawmakers thatearly independence is impossible without a compromise with theKremlin.   She said Gorbachev agreed in a telephone call Tuesday aftermeeting with Landsbergis that he would end a crippling economicembargo and begin negotiations that ``will discuss a differentstatus for Lithuania, including as an independent state.''   But the only official statement from Moscow was much moretoughly worded.   The Soviet news agency Tass, quoting what it said was anofficial report on the meeting with Landsbergis, said theLithuanian president was told talks can only be held ``if Lithuaniadeclares a moratorium and suspends the act of March 11 for a periodof talks. They can be held only in the context of aninter-republican dialogue on the preparation of a new union treatyand the formation of a union of sovereign socialists states.''</TEXT></DOC>
