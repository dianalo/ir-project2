Union leaders are relieved that Congress, by creating aspecial three-member review panel, gave them another chanceto fend off work-rule changes the unions oppose. But they'reunhappy that the new law limits their ability to preventthose changes and empowers the review board to arbitrate anyunresolved issues.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We would rather be found innocent. Instead, we're goingto get a new trial,&quot; a rail union official said.   Railroads, for their part, are pleased about thoselimitations, though Congress stopped short of the industry'sgoal of simply enacting earlier recommendations of apresidential emergency board, which both sides agree favoredthe industry. Michael Walsh, chairman of Union PacificCorp.'s rail unit, said Congress and the Bush administrationarrived at a &quot;fair conclusion.&quot;   The legislation that sent some 200,000 striking workersback to their jobs was signed by President Bush yesterday. Itwas passed in quick succession Wednesday night by a Housesubcommittee, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, thefull House on a 400-5 vote and the Senate without debate.   Congressional leaders, uneasy about having to resolve thethree-year labor dispute, made sure it wouldn't return toCapitol Hill by giving the new panel arbitration powers. Theboard will have 65 days to resolve any remaining disputesthat the two sides cannot settle through collectivebargaining.   Fred Hardin, president of the United Transportation Union,said late Wednesday that he didn't like the compromise thatlawmakers were developing. By yesterday however, Mr. Hardinwas saying he was &quot;well satisfied&quot; and happy &quot;to get anotherchance to try.&quot; He predicted the railroads will negotiate anagreement with his union out of fear that the arbitration in65 days will be &quot;far more middle-of-the-road&quot; than theemergency board's recommendations.   The board's report included recommendations that would setthe stage for more cuts in crews in local bargaining, andboost the mileage that operating workers like the UTU'sconductors and brakemen must travel to receive a day's pay.   Mac Fleming, president of the Brotherhood of Maintenanceof Way Employes, voiced bitterness at the outcome. &quot;We cameout of this very defeated, much worse than we anticipated,&quot;he said. The legislation &quot;virtually imposes&quot; such emergencyboard recommendations as the one requiring his union's trackworkers to travel much farther from home by vastly expandingtheir work regions. Mr. Fleming said that unions have toprove an &quot;inequity&quot; in the emergency board's position, whichhe said will be hard to do.   Larry McFather, president of the Brotherhood of LocomotiveEngineers, which seeks heftier wage increases than the boardproposed, said management wanted the board's recommendations&quot;badly and shamelessly, and got them.&quot; His union will keepingfighting for &quot;whatever fairness and equity is possible,&quot; hesaid.   And another rail union official voiced optimism that &quot;wehave a chance to get things clarified on a couple of issues,&quot;such as mileage, crew sizes, the work areas formaintenance-of-way employees, and greater flexibility soughtby railroads to shift shop workers to different kinds ofjobs.   Railroads are more sanguine about the legislation. Oneindustry official said &quot;it's not far from a mandate&quot; for theemergency board's report, adding, &quot;I can't see why we wouldfeel too bad.&quot; Gerald Grinstein, chairman of BurlingtonNorthern Inc., said the new plan &quot;hopefully gives us anopportunity to prove to an arbitrator that we are carryingtoo many people in our locomotives and we could do a muchmore efficient job.&quot;   Charles Marshall, a senior vice president of ConsolidatedRail Corp., noting that the law creates a presumption for theboard's recommendations, said he'll wait to see if the newpanel follows that idea closely or goes &quot;far afield.&quot;   The outcome seemed largely to vindicate a tough standtaken by the industry. The railroads decided to stop allservice, including some commuter-rail and Amtrak operations,which the unions didn't strike, rather than try to providelimited service with supervisors. That helped create anational emergency that prompted Congress to end the walkoutquickly. The BLE's Mr. McFather tended to agree, chargingthat Congress was forced to act &quot;in the face of a nationalcrisis in which management dragged in Amtrak passenger andcommuter lines.&quot;   Burlington Northern's Mr. Grinstein said that this time,the railroads banded together so that a selective strikeagainst one would have triggered a unified response. &quot;Wedidn't want a weaker carrier to be picked off, and . . .reach an agreement&quot; that would set a pattern for the rest, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
