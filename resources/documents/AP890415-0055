PAUL (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Folk medicines for ailments such as fever andchicken pox are contributing to a high rate of lead poisoning amongHmong children, officials say.   Last year, the Southeast Asian children made up more than 60percent of the lead poisoning cases reported to the city publichealth division. In the first several months of this year, eight of13 cases were Hmong, the division said.   While health officials attribute most of the cases toenvironmental factors, such as lead paint chips in old housing andcontaminated soil, they say the Hmong's use of medicinal powders isa contributing factor.   Over the past six years, tests of medicinal powders used by someHmong families found some with high levels of lead and arsenic,including one batch containing 90 percent lead, said Tim Ringhand,a public health nurse.   Despite warnings, Hmong parents continue using the medicinebecause they find it hard to believe their children are in danger,officials said. There is no Hmong word for lead and effects of leadpoisoning don't show up for years.   ``For Hmong people, it's not because they're not caring of theirchildren,'' said Pam Thao, a bilingual health assistant. ``Theproblem is they're too protecting. They don't trust outsiders.''   Some members of the Hmong community said the studies linkinglead to their medicinal powders are an attack on their culture.   ``We've been using the medicine for years, long before the birthof this country,'' said Nkajlo Vangh, president of Lao FamilyCommunity of Minnesota. ``I'd like to get a second opinion.''   Health officials said have no firm idea of how prevalent themedicinanl powders are because few families admit to using them.   ``If they took away my Tylenol in (Laos) and gave me powders,then I'd be angry too. I'd hide my Tylenol,'' Ringhand said.</TEXT></DOC>
