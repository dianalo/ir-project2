Many of these books are quite inadequate; this one is not.From the general to the specific, from fundamentals of surface reactionsand structure, the book builds well to a consideration of recent studiesof the oxidation of carbon monoxide on palladium and platinum. This choice,and that of other topics, seems appropriate. The reference list, bunchedat the end of the book, is on the short and selective side, but it providesan adequate entry into the literature.</TEXT></DOC>
