As revised,the regulation would be composed of six subparts and an appendix, eachof which is discussed below.Subpart AThis subpart sets out the definitions and administrative provisions whichcontrol throughout the regulation. Generally, the administrative provisionsare the same as in the present regulation. Under these provisions, eachemployee is responsible for compliance with the regulation; the EthicsCounselor is responsible for the FDIC's ethics program; the Executive Secretaryis designated as the Ethics Counselor; and remedial actions for violationscan be appealed to the Chairman.A number of new definitions are established, many of which are self-explanatory.Noteworthy changes include the following: The terms ``appear personally,''``official responsibility,'' and ``senior employee'' reflect the inclusionof post-employment provisions in Part 336. The definitions duplicate statutorylanguage found at 18 U.S.C. 207. The terms ``assisted entity'' and ``assumingentity'' would replace the current definitions of ``assisted bank'' and``assuming bank.'' The new definitions are necessary in order to coverthe complex arrangements arising out of transactions under section 13(c)of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1823(c)). ``Covered employee''would mean a person required to file Confidential Statements of Employmentand Financial Interests or Financial Disclosure Reports. The incumbentsof the positions referenced have duties and responsibilities that empowerthem to participate personally and substantially in significant discretionaryactions affecting the government or government decision-making. ``Reviewingofficial'' would mean the Deputy Ethics Counselor delegated the authorityto receive, review, and retain statements of employment and financial interestsof covered employees.Subpart BThis subpart mostly incorporates the provisions of 5 CFR Part 735, theU.S. Office of Personnel Management regulation which establishes government-widestandards of conduct for federal employees. Because 5 CFR 735.101 requiresthe FDIC to incorporate the provisions, they will not be discussed in greatdetail.Proposed changes include the following: Section 336.8, which relates tothe acceptance of gifts, entertainment, favors, and loans from personsaffected by an FDIC decision, has been clarified in several ways. First,existing provisions relating to the acceptance of things of monetary valuefrom friends and relatives have been revised to clarify that (i) the thingof monetary value must come from the individual and (ii) any relationshipbetween that individual and a regulated entity or firm with which the agencydoes business must be coincidental. Second, a separate provision has beenadded to allow the acceptance of mementos of nominal extrinsic value givenin commemoration of a special event or activity. Third, the exception forthe acceptance of food and refreshments in the ordinary course of a meetingor conference has been revised and is now incorporated into andSection;andSection;336.8(b) (5) and (6). Section 336.8(b)(5) is unchanged from the currentprovision. Section 336.8(b)(6) allows attendance at widely attended groupfunctions when a prior determination has been made that attendance is inthe best interest of the FDIC. Section 336.9 has been amended to providefor the FDIC's and an employee's acceptance of travel, lodging, or subsistencefrom charitable, tax-exempt organizations. Existing provisions of andSection;336.11 have been amended to make it clear that no honorarium may be acceptedin conjunction with any appearance, speech, or article related to FDICmatters.Subpart CThis subpart sets out the FDIC's rules relating to financial interestsand outside activities of employees. As in the present regulation, employeesgenerally are prohibited from having financial interests or obligationsthat conflict or appear to conflict with the employees' FDIC duties andresponsibilities. The proposed regulation (andSection; 336.15) also prohibitsthe negotiation by an employee of, or arrangement for, future employmentwith a person whose financial interests may be affected by the employee'sofficial duties while the employee is personally engaged in a matter affectingsuch person.The subpart also addresses the following specific areas: permissible extensionsof credit; ownership of bank securities; purchase of liquidation assets;purchase of FDIC property and providing services to FDIC; purchase of assetsof insured banks; outside employment or activity; and employment of familymembers by persons other than the FDIC.The rules relating to extensions of credit in andSection; 336.16 have beenrevised and the prohibited and permissible sources of credit for variouscategories of employees are identified in a matrix form for ready reference(Appendix A). The revisions recognize changes in the way in which banksand financial services companies conduct their business and in the scopeand intensity of the FDIC's supervisory and receivership activities. First,a disqualification has been added (andSection; 336.16(c)) that generallyprecludes covered employees from participating in matters affecting theircreditors. Second, covered employees who participate personally and substantiallyin matters involving the rendering of financial assistance to an institutionare precluded from borrowing from the institution until it is no longerclassified as an assisted or assuming entity (andSection; 336.16(b)(5)).Third, credit restrictions imposed upon liquidation employees and closedbank attorneys would be modified so that such employees would no longerbe automatically required to cancel existing credit card accounts withassisted or assuming banks headquartered <T3>outside </T3>their region of official assignment (andSection; 336.16(b)(3)).Fourth, examiners and certain other covered employees of the Division ofBank Supervision would be permitted under certain circumstances to obtaincredit cards from insured state nonmember banks located outside their regionof official assignment (andSection; 336.16(a)). The Ethics Counselor in consultationwith the appropriate director may require disqualification whenever anemployee's credit relationship presents a conflict of interest or the appearancethereof. Fifth, the proposed regulation (andSection; 336.16(d)(1)) wouldpermit an employee to renegotiate a loan from a prohibited creditor if:the employee is unable to arrange, without undue financial hardship, aloan from a nonprohibited creditor, the terms and conditions of the renegotiatedloan are on the same terms and conditions as those offered to the generalpublic, and the prior written approval of the Ethics Counselor is obtained.This provision is proposed because of the hardships certain employees haveexperienced in refinancing debt contracted prior to FDIC employment. Becausean employee is disqualified from participating in any action relating tohis or her creditor, there should be no conflict of interest or appearancethereof nor any violation of 18 U.S.C. 213 in the case of an examiner.The current andSection; 336.18 has been amended to apply solely to the purchaseof liquidation assets. Additionally, it has been expanded to require self-disqualificationfrom a sales transaction involving a relative or any organization or partnershipwith which the employee, employee's spouse, or dependent child is associatedand adds a prohibition regarding disclosure of inside information withregard to a proposed sale of liquidation assets. Section 336.19 has beenretitled ``Purchase of FDIC property.'' The proposed section now enumeratesprohibitions heretofore included by reference to an outstanding directive.The new section provides all employees with guidelines without the necessityof obtaining supporting directives. A new andSection; 336.20 has been addedwhich sets out the conditions under which employees may purchase insuredbank assets.Proposed andSection; 336.23, previously numbered andSection; 336.20, has beenexpanded to require disclosure of employment of family members by firmshaving business with the FDIC. The change reflects the expanded sphereof possible conflicts arising from liquidation activities.Subpart DThis subpart sets out FDIC rules relating to the filing of required reportsby FDIC employees. Significant changes are proposed with regard to reportsof indebtedness and of financial interests. No significant changes wouldbe made to reports of interest in FDIC decision or those required underthe Ethics in Government Act of 1978.The proposed revision eliminates, because the information called for bythe report is incorporated into the statement of employment and financialinterests, the filing of a separate Confidential Report of Indebtedness,now required to be filed on a semiannual basis, except for employees coveredby andSection; 336.28. The reporting date for the statement of employmentand financial interests, now filed as of June 30, will be changed to December31.As to statements of employment and financial interests, several changeswill be made. First, employees of the Divisions of Bank Supervision andLiquidation who are required to file such statements will be identifiedby grade level and job series. Second, statements will be submitted tothe reviewing official, who is the Deputy Ethics Counselor for an employee'splace of assignment. Third, statements will be retained in the office ofthe reviewing official. The reviewing official will submit a copy of thestatement to the Ethics Counselor certifying his or her review. All reportswill be held in confidence by the Deputy Ethics Counselors and the EthicsCounselor.Subpart EThis subpart has been retitled and now sets out FDIC rules relating tolimitations on former employees, including special government employees,with respect to participation in matters connected with their former dutiesand responsibilities while serving with the FDIC.The proposed addition paraphrases certain of the limitations on representationfound at 18 U.S.C. 207 as applied to all former employees generally andsenior employees specifically. Secondly, the proposal establishes the rightof former employees to consult with the Ethics Counselor as to the propertyof an appearance before the agency. Last, the regulation sets out the FDIC'sright to suspend appearance privileges when a person has knowingly failedto comply with the provisions of this subpart.Subpart FThis subpart relates to the standards of conduct applicable to specialgovernment employees. No substantive changes have been made other thanto redesignate the subpart.AppendixThis appendix sets out the provisions of andSection; 336.16 in a table format.The agency attaches great significance to employees' compliance with thecredit restrictions enumerated in the applicable subsection. The appendixwill provide a ready reference for each class of employee subject to suchrestrictions.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 336</ITAG>Conflicts of interest; Credit; Disclosure requirements; Government employees;Former government employees.Accordingly, Part 336 is proposed to be revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 336_EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES AND CONDUCT </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_Purpose, Scope, Definitions, and Administrative Provisions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.1 Purpose and scope. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.2 Definitions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.3 Employee responsibility, counseling, and distribution of regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.4 Designation of Ethics Counselor, Alternate Ethics Counselor,and Deputy Ethics Counselors. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.5 Sanctions and remedial actions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.6 Review of remedial actions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Ethical and Other Conduct and Responsibilities of Employees</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.7 General rules. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.8 Gifts, entertainment, favors, and loans. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.9 Travel expenses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.10 Use of official information. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.11 Lectures, speeches, and manuscripts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.12 Employment by FDIC of relatives. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.13 Use of FDIC property. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.14 Indebtedness, gambling, and other conduct. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Financial Interests and Obligations; Outside Employment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.15 General rules. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.16 Extensions of credit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.17 Bank securities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.18 Purchase of liquidation assets. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.19 Purchase of FDIC property. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.20 Purchase of assets of insured banks. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.21 Providing goods or services to the FDIC. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.22 Outside employment and other activity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.23 Employment of family members by persons other than the FDIC.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Reports of Interest in Bank Securities, Interest in FDICDecision, and Employment Upon Resignation; Statements of Employment andFinancial Interests; Financial Disclosure Reports </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.24 Report of interest in bank securities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.25 Report of interest in FDIC decision. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.26 Report of employment upon resignation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.27 Statement of employment and financial interests. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.28 Financial Disclosure Reports under the Ethics in GovernmentAct of 1978. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart E_Limitations on Activities of Former Employees </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.29 Limitations on representation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.30 Consultation as to propriety of appearance before the FDIC.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.31 Suspension of appearance privilege. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart F_Ethical and other Conduct and Responsibilities of SpecialGovernment Employees </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.32 Use of FDIC employment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.33 Use of inside information. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.34 Coercion. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.35 Gifts, entertainment, favors, and loans. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.36 Miscellaneous statutory provisions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">336.37 Statements of employment and financial interests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix to Part 336_Matrix of Credit Prohibitions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>E.O. 11222, 3 CFR 1964-1965 Comp.; 5 CFR 735.104; 5CFR 737.1(a); E.O. 12565. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_Purpose, Scope, Definitions, and Administrative Provisions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;336.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose and scope. </ITAG>In order to assure the proper performance of FDIC business and to maintainpublic confidence in government, FDIC employees are expected to maintainunusually high standards of honesty, integrity, impartiality, and conductand to avoid misconduct and conflicts of interest, or the appearance ofconflicts of interest.
