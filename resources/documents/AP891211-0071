The paper said he was specifically referring to the kidnappingby Israeli commandos of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslempreacher from south Lebanon, on July 28.   On July 31, Shiite Moslem kidnappers of the Organization of theOppressed on Earth said they killed their American hostage Lt. Col.William Higgins in retaliation for the kidnapping.   Most of the 18 Western hostages held in Lebanon are believed tobe in the hands of Iranian-backed Shiite groups. They are eightAmericans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishmanand an Italian.   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985, in west Beirut.   The death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the election of themore pragmatic President Hashemi Rafsanjani gave rise to some hopesof Iranian pressure on the kidnappers to free their captives.</TEXT></DOC>
