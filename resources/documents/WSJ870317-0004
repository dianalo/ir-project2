Rawl, new chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Corp., spots a visitor admiring John D. Rockefeller's roll-top desk outside the company's executive dining room. &quot;That may be up for sale next,&quot; he says.    He jests, of course. But while the founder's desk seems safe on display on the 53rd floor of Exxon's Manhattan tower, the building itself was recently purchased by a Japanese company.    In many ways, the oil giant that uses a tiger to promote its gasoline but is often described as an elephant is smaller than it used to be. It recently sold its electric-motor and nuclear businesses. Oil-refining capacity has been cut 1.5 million barrels a day, more than the operating ability of many oil companies. Capital and exploration spending is down 40% from 1985. The world-wide staff has been reduced to 102,000 employees from the 1981 peak of 182,000. &quot;The elephant,&quot; says Mr. Rawl, &quot;is a lot slimmer.&quot;    The downsizing has accomplished pretty well what the company set out to do, according to Mr. Rawl and Lee R. Raymond, the new president, in their first interview since assuming their posts Jan. 1. It has made Exxon more efficient in areas of the oil business where the company can get the highest returns and the highest profit margins. But it has raised concerns among shareholders and industry analysts about how the company is investing its large cash flow at a time when some of its bigger competitors appear to be more aggressive in acquisitions and in exploring for new oil fields.    The shrinking may be over. No further asset sales are pending at the moment, the Exxon officers suggest, though Mr. Raymond says the company eventually may close two more refineries, including one in France. &quot;We used to be the world's greatest seller of heavy fuel oil,&quot; he says, &quot;but I don't get a lot of fun out of selling fuel oil and not making any money.&quot;    Despite the shrinking, Exxon remains the world's largest and most prestigious oil company. It operates in more than 80 countries, and its revenue -- $76.2 billion last year -- approaches the value of all oil sold by the 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. No other corporation matches its profits -- $5.36 billion in 1986, despite last year's oil-price collapse. Its projected cash flow -- $10 billion to $11 billion this year -- exceeds that of many governments.    Size and enormous cash flow have buffered Exxon from devastation in the oil industry, where many of its debt-loaded competitors struggle daily just to survive. Yet, some industry executives and analysts question whether Exxon may be growing stagnant. The takeover-minded T. Boone Pickens Jr. of Mesa Petroleum Co. says that like many other American oil companies, &quot;Exxon is liquidating.&quot; An oil company is assumed to be in liquidation when it isn't replacing reserves as fast as it is using them up.    &quot;Why hasn't it made a successful pass at another big company?&quot; asks one retired Exxon executive. &quot;The perception is that Exxon is being liquidated by not doing exploration and by not buying properties.&quot;    Exxon's officers say such complaints don't take into account the narrowing of profit margins or dilution of earnings if the company got into a bidding race for oil properties or plowed yet more money into exploration. &quot;If you are talking to explorers, to geologists, they shoot craps,&quot; says Mr. Rawl. &quot;They don't worry about the bottom line.&quot; But, he asks, &quot;How . . . can you spend $7 billion a year and be liquidating?&quot; Though down sharply from 1985, Exxon's capital and exploration expenditures exceeded $7.2 billion in 1986. This year, $6.5 billion is budgeted.    &quot;We've taken a lot of heat since we reduced our capital and exploration expenditures,&quot; says Mr. Rawl. &quot;The fact is, though, that we still spend more in this country and foreign than any other non-government oil company.&quot;    The Exxon officers say, nonetheless, that the company was more than just a bystander in the industry's big mergers and probably would have made a major acquisition if the bidding hadn't gotten so spirited. &quot;We looked at them all,&quot; says Mr. Raymond, &quot;but we had in mind a pretty firm standard of what was attractive and what wasn't.&quot; Adds Mr. Rawl: &quot;We didn't think they (the takeover targets) were good deals at a high oil-price forecast. As it turned out, though, the price didn't stay high, and therefore we were lucky.&quot;    Also, he says, many bidders were in much more need of oil reserves than Exxon. &quot;We were coming from a very strong resource base, trying to compete with people who were not sure where their next development well was coming from,&quot; he says. &quot;They were willing to bet the farm, and we weren't.&quot;    Exxon has made a lot of acquisitions of smaller properties, though the pace slowed last year after oil prices fell. But the plunge in above-ground prices didn't result in as many depressed sales of oil reserves as might have been expected. Banks that held such reserves as collateral for loans to oil companies wouldn't permit sales until they were repaid. Also, most holders of oil properties felt that the price of petroleum would rebound, and their asking prices remained relatively high.    Unlike many oil companies, Exxon didn't have big write-downs on its reserves last year. Its proven oil and gas reserves held remarkably stable, in fact -- down only marginally at year-end 1986 to 15.1 billion barrels, as measured in the oil equivalent, from 15.4 billion barrels a year earlier. Mr. Rawl notes Exxon also has 16 billion oil-equivalent barrels of probable and &quot;static&quot; reserves -- discoveries that aren't currently being developed because of transportation, economic or technology reasons. &quot;We've got as much out there in the bank as we have in the pipeline,&quot; he says.    This comfortable reserves position is a major reason Exxon officials say they don't worry about what to do with their cash flow. &quot;If you take the kind of static resources we have,&quot; says Mr. Raymond, &quot;I don't think there's going to be a problem in terms of lack of opportunities.&quot;    Exxon's outlook was and remains that the real value of hydrocarbons will rise substantially over time and its strategy is to make the right long-term investments.    While not predicting, the Exxon officials say their planning is based on the price remaining flat -- around $15 a barrel in 1986 dollars -- for several years and then rising faster than inflation. &quot;One day we are going to wake up, and the price will be up&quot; significantly, says Mr. Raymond. &quot;The technical answer in our planning basis is that the 'knee' in the curve is in 1990 plus or minus two years.&quot; Exxon will be one of the few companies &quot;in a position to 'lever up' with an increase in price -- both in its near-term earnings impact and its longer-range investment opportunities.&quot;    Company officials say Exxon still seeks &quot;suitably priced&quot; oil properties but is conservative in the search. That is for antitrust and other reasons, but chiefly because they believe they have other options for their investments, such as the future development of their own static resources. Also, they note the company has acquired more than 500 million barrels of reserves, on an oil-equivalent basis, over the past three years. Total price paid was $1.4 billion, acquiring for Exxon oil in the ground at an average cost of $2.82 a barrel.    Mr. Rawl doesn't rule out further big acquisitions, such as the $500 million purchase in 1985 of a 49% stake in Hunt Oil Co.'s interest in a production-sharing agreement with the Yemen Arab Republic, including the prolific Alif oil field. But he insists the company isn't helping shareholders if it substantially boosts assets only to get a modest earnings increase.    Even as it shops for properties, however, Exxon has spent several times as much buying back 18% of its own stock. Since the repurchases began in 1983, Exxon has acquired 153.7 million shares for $7 billion -- far exceeding the $5 billion four-year buyback recently announced by General Motors Corp. Exxon paid an average price of $46 a share; in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Exxon closed at $82.125, down 50 cents.    Despite some criticism by analysts that Exxon should be putting its cash to better use, Mr. Rawl says that by buying back shares Exxon &quot;acquired&quot; oil in the ground -- its own reserves -- cheaper than it can find new oil fields or buy petroleum properties from others. The cost of repurchasing shares so far means that, in effect, they are buying oil at $2.42 a barrel, which &quot;is a lot better than spending $7, $8 or $9 a barrel looking for it,&quot; says Mr. Rawl. The figure is arrived at by dividing shares into the company's proven reserves.    Mr. Rawl cites other buyback benefits as well. Earnings are spread across fewer shares. In 1986, while Exxon's total net income was up 10% to $5.36 billion, per-share earnings rose 15% to $7.42 because of fewer shares outstanding. Though &quot;modest&quot; share repurchases continue on a month-to-month basis, company officials say they don't necessarily think this the best investment they can make. &quot;Sound development investments are obviously better,&quot; says Jack F. Bennett, senior vice president and chief financial officer. &quot;We are always on the prowl for those.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
