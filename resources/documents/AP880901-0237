Four years ago, the Federal Aviation Administration was on theverge of requiring airliners to use a special fuel additive whichits supporters said would stop aircraft fuel vapors from ignitingin a crash.   Although the anti-misting additive suppressed the spread offlames in repeated static tests, a highly publicized test using aremote-controlled Boeing 720 in the California desert failedmiserably in November 1984, as the deliberately crashed jet wasengulfed in a ball of flames.   The failed test came only weeks before a regulation requiringthe additive was to have been announced, although the airlines hadargued the additive's value was questionable and there wereindications it could interfere with engine performance.</TEXT><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Less than two years after he won re-election in anhistoric landslide, Michael Dukakis finds himself in anembarrassing position at home with a new poll showing him even withGeorge Bush in Massachusetts and widespread unhappiness with hisrecent performance as governor.

Dukakis has labeled Bush's environmental claims ``anelection-year conversion.'' He says Boston's harbor has ``beenpolluted for hundreds of years, and I'm very proud to be thegovernor who's cleaning it up ... no thanks to Vice President Bushand the administration he is part of.''</TEXT><DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Shipyard and steel workers ended strikesThursday, and Lech Walesa urged others to halt Poland's worst laborturmoil in seven years now that the government has agreed todiscuss Solidarity's future.
