Constitution: The element comprisesboron-containing neutron absorbers the surface of which is coated withacid-resistant layers. Such layers are formed by at first applying hotpress to prepare sintered powder devices comprising spheroidal mixtureof boron carbide and graphite and by flame-spraying Cr to the outer surfaceof the device under the inert atmosphere at a reduced pressure. Then,a plurality of Cr-coated boron carbide-graphite elements are chargedinto a tubular quartz vessel and heat treatment is applied under He streamat 500 deg C for 2000 hr and at 500 deg C for 5000 hr. Preferred layerthickness is usually from about 50 to 200 {mu}m. (Takahashi, M.).</TEXT></DOC>
