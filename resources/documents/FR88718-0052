The following summary also contains a list of submissions thatwere dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appeals </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Decker andamp; Hallman, 6/16/88; KFA-0187</T3>On May 20, 1988, Decker andamp; Hallman, a law firm, filed an Appeal froma determination issued to the firm on April 23, 1988 by the Director ofthe Office of Oil and Gas of the Energy Information Administration (Director)of the Department of Energy. In that determination, the Director partiallygranted a request for information pursuant to the Freedom of InformationAct (FOIA), but withheld a master list of companies from which respondentsto an Energy Information Administration survey are selected. In consideringthe Appeal, the DOE found that the Director's denial was based upon a misinterpretationof the scope of the Appellant's request for information. The Director interpretedthe Appellant's request to include all potential respondents to the EIAsurvey, and not just the names and addresses of actual respondents to thesurvey, as originally requested by Decker andamp; Hallman. Consequently,the case was remanded to the Director for a determination regarding thereleasability of the names and addresses of the survey respondents. <ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>William Albert Hewgley, 6/15/88; KFA-0186</T3>William Albert Hewgley filed an Appeal from a determination issued to himby the Inspector General of the Department of Energy. In his determination,the Inspector General first found that 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2) and (k)(2)of the Privacy Act shielded from disclosure any documents Hewgley soughtunder that Act. The Inspector General then denied Mr. Hewgley's requestfor the same documents under the Freedom of Information Act on the groundthat no documents responsive to his request are known to exist. In considering the Appeal, the DOE contacted the FOI/Privacy Acts Specialistat the DOE Inspector General's Office and learned that some documents responsiveto Mr. Hewgley's Original FOI/Privacy Acts Request do exist. Accordingly,the DOE remanded Mr. Hewgley's Request to the Office of the Inspector Generalfor a new and thorough search for documents responsive to the Request.The DOE further ordered that the Inspector General either (i) promptlyrelease any responsive documents to Mr. Hewgley or (ii) promptly issuea denial letter which adequately justifies the applicability of an exemptionto each of the documents withheld. <ITAG tagnum="84">Petitions for Special Redress </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mississippi, 6/13/88; KEG-0034 </T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning the Petitions for SpecialRedress filed by the State of Mississippi. Mississippi sought approvalto use Stripper Well funds for a project which the DOE's Assistant Secretaryfor Conservation and Renewable Energy held to be inconsistent with theterms of the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement. The DOE approved the State'sproposal to use $503,800 for a rail yard switching relocation project inGreenwood, Mississippi. The DOE determined that the project was remedialbecause it would result in smoother traffic flow, less idling time formotorists, and hence substantial fuel savings for the considerable numberof motorists traveling through Greenwood. The DOE also found that the projectwas timely and part of a well-balanced restitutionary plan. In conclusion,the DOE found that Mississippi's program was permissible under the termsof the Settlement, Agreement and OHA precedent. Accordingly Mississippi'sPetition for Special Redress was approved. <ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Texas, 6/13/88; KEG-0033 </T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning a Petition for Special Redresssubmitted by the State of Texas. The State sought approval to use StripperWell monies for a project which the DOE's Assistant Secretary for Conservationand Renewable Energy held to be inconsistent with the terms of the StripperWell Settlement Agreement. The DOE disapproved Texas' proposal to use $8million to conduct research related to enhanced oil recovery from oil reservoirson State lands in Texas. In reaching this determination, the DOE foundthat the Texas proposal was not restitutionary because the primary beneficiariesof the proposal would be oil companies and certain owners of surface rightson State lands rather than injured consumers. The DOE concluded that oilcompanies and owners of surface rights were narrow economic interests thatshould not receive the lion's share of benefits that were intended to bedistributed to consumers overcharged on purchases of petroleum products.Accordingly, Texas' Petition for Special Redress was denied. <ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Modification and/or Rescission </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Arizona, 6/13/88; KER-0041</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning the Motion for Reconsiderationfiled by the State of Arizona. The State sought reconsideration of a DOEdetermination that denied the Petition for Special Redress filed by Arizonaconcerning the use of Stripper Well funds for a proposed natural gas andelectric utility assistance program which would use $7 million of StripperWell funds over a 2-year period. In its motion, Arizona demonstrated thatthe State's low-income elderly population would be the primary beneficiariesof the program. Accordingly, Arizona's Motion for Reconsideration was granted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Motions for Discovery</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>LaJet, Inc., 6/15/88; KRD-0011</T3>LaJet, Inc. (LaJet) filed a Motion for Discovery relating to a ProposedRemedial Order (PRO) issued to its predecessor in interest, North AmericanPetroleum Company (NAPCO), by the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA)on May 8, 1985. In the PRO, the ERA alleges that NAPCO entered into a seriesof processing agreements with Young Refining Company, a small refiner whichhad received 100% entitlements exception relief. According to the ERA,NAPCO entered into these agreements for the sole purpose of evading itsentitlements purchase obligations. The firm's actions, asserts the ERA,violated 10 CFR 205.202 in that they circumvented the Entitlements Regulationsset forth at 10 CFR 211.66 and 211.67. In its Motion for Discovery, LaJetsought the following items: (1) Documents and transcripts of testimonyprovided to DOE by or on behalf of Young concerning Young's processingagreements, purchase and sales of crude oil, and sales of refined productduring the audit period; (2) workpapers explaining the manner in whichthe ERA computed violation and interest amounts set forth in the PRO; and(3) documents relating to the contemporaneous construction of certain DOErulemakings and regulations. In considering LaJet's motion, the DOE firstdetermined that the firm had already been provided with sufficient auditworkpapers to understand and challenge the methodology employed by theERA in computing the alleged violation amount and interest assessment.Next, the DOE found that LaJet's contemporaneous construction request wasalmost identical to that submitted by the firm in another case. Since theDOE had recently found the firm's request to be without merit in the othercase, the DOE denied LaJet's request based on the reasons set forth inthat other case. Finally, the DOE questioned the relevancy of submissionsmade by Young in exceptions proceedings in this case, pointing out thedifferences between the exceptions process and remedial order proceedings.The DOE then found that most of the material submitted by Young in itsexceptions proceedings is publicly available. To the extent redactionshave been made to any of the Young material because of confidentiality,the DOE held that LaJet had failed to identify specific deleted materialthey seek or attempt to establish that such deleted material constitutesrelevant and material evidence. Accordingly, the DOE denied LaJet's discoverymotion.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>The Crude Company, Inc., 6/16/88; KRD-0440</T3>The Crude Company, Inc. (TCC) filed a Motion for Discovery in connectionwith a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) issued to the firm on January 9, 1987.In the PRO, the ERA alleges that TCC resold crude oil at a price that exceededits maximum allowable selling price, or maintained an average markup inexcess of its permissible average markup (PAM), in violation of the DOEprice regulations codified at 10 C.F.R. Part 212, Subparts F and L. Inits Motion for Discovery, TCC propounded numerous requests for admissions,interrogatories, and requests for documents regarding the following issues:(1) The ERA's discretionary choice of TCC's imputed May 15, 1973 base price;(2) the ERA's use of separate inventory accounting to calculate TCC's productcosts and banks; and (3) the ERA's calculation of TCC's PAM. A majorityof these requests were denied because the firm failed to show that thediscovery was necessary for it to obtain relevant and material factualevidence. Five requests for admissions were granted, however, because theysought material, factual information concerning the timing of TCC's firsttwo successful offers for the resale of crude oil. In addition, the OHAdetermined that the production of additional information by the ERA wouldbe helpful in detemining whether the ERA properly used its prosecutorialdiscretion in establishing TCC's May 15 base price. Accordingly, the OHAordered the ERA to submit information concerning the following three issues:(1) The reasonableness and scope of the ERA's efforts to locate TCC's nearestcomparable outlet; (2) the comparability of TCC and the firm which theERA claims was TCC's nearest comparable outlet; and (3) the reasonablenessof the ERA's choice of TCC's May 15 base price.<ITAG tagnum="84">Refund Applications</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Beacon Oil Company/Cash Oil Company of California, 6/17/88; RF238-8,RF238-75</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning two Applications for Refundfiled by Cash Oil Company of California (Cash) in the Beacon Oil Companyspecial refund proceeding. On March 25, 1986, Mr. Clyde E. Harvey, thepresident of Cash, filed a refund claim; on October 15, 1988, Cash's counselsubmitted a second Application for Refund which falsely stated that Cashhad not filed a previous claim in the Beacon proceeding. As an initialmatter, the DOE dismissed the second application. The March 25, 1986 applicationwas based only on Cash's purchases of Beacon motor gasoline during theAugust 19, 1973, through March 31, 1975 consent order period. Because Cashalready had received credit refunds from Beacon based on those purchases,Cash's original claim was denied.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Billings Freight Systems/Kensington Corp., 6/13/88; RF272-1172, RF272-1192</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting two Applications for Refundfrom crude oil overcharge funds based on each Applicant's purchases ofrefined petroleum products during the period August 19, 1973 through January27, 1981. Each Applicant submitted detailed documentation supporting itsclaim. As an end-user, each Applicant was entitled to receive a refundof its full volumetric share. The sum of the refunds granted in this Decisionis $3,337.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Conoco, Inc./Gulf Oil Corporation, 6/16/88; RF220-277</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Applications for Refundfiled by Chevron Corporation on behalf of Gulf Oil Corporation. In itsApplication, Chevron sought refunds for Gulf's purchases of propane, butaneand motor gasoline from Conoco Inc. during the period from January 1, 1973through January 26, 1981. In the Decision and Order, the DOE determinedthat Gulf was a spot purchaser of motor gasoline from Conoco, had not showninjury, and was therefore not entitled to a refund for these purchases.With respect to Gulf's purchases of propane and butane, the DOE determinedthat Chevron was entitled to refunds of $426 for propand and $1 for butane.Including interest, the total refund granted in this Decision is $599.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Earl L. Passwaters et al., 6/13/88; RF272-6807 et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting refunds from crude oil overchargefunds to 14 applicants based on their respective purchases of refined petroleumproducts during the period August 19, 1973, through January 27, 1981. Eachapplicant was an end-user of petroleum products, and established its claimeither by consulting actual purchase records or by estimating its consumption.As end-users of the products they claimed, each applicant was found injuredunder the end-user presumption of injury. The sum of the refunds grantedin this Decision is $5,963.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Gilttner Public Schools, et al., 6/15/88; RF272-9623 et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting refunds from crude oil overchargefunds to eight applicants based on their respective purchases of refinedpetroleum products during the period August 19, 1973, through January 27,1981. Each applicant used the products for various activities, and eachdetermined its claim either by consulting actual purchase records or bya reasonable method of estimation. Each applicant was an end-user of theproducts it claimed and was therefore presumed by the DOE to have beeninjured. The sum of the refunds granted in this Decision is $1,129. Allof the Claimants will be eligible for additional refunds as additionalcrude oil overcharge funds become available.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Gulf Oil Corporation/Rice-Lindquist, Inc., 6/16/88; RF40-1484</T3>Rice-Lindquist, Inc. (Rice) filed an Application for Refund in which thefirm sought a portion of the fund obtained by the DOE through a consentorder entered into with Gulf Oil Corporation (Gulf). The DOE found thatRice demonstrated that it purchased Gulf motor gasolilne, fuel oil anddiesel fuel during the consent order period and that Rice was injured.Under the procedures outlined in <T3>Gulf Oil Corp.,</T3> 12 DOE andpara; 85,048 (1984), Rice was found entitledto receive a volumetric refund of $57,547. In addition, the firm is entitledto receive accrued interest of $16,509 for a total refund of $74,056. However,the DOE concluded that it is not appropriate to issue the refund directlyto Rice at the present time. Rice is a respondent in an on-going enforcementproceeding. This case is now on appeal to the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission. Pending the outcome of the enforcement proceeding, the DOEdetermined that the refund of $74,056 should be deposited into a separateinterest-bearing escrow account on behalf of Rice.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Lockheed Air Terminal Inc./Northwest Airlines, Inc., 6/15/88; RF269-24</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a refund to Northwest Airlineson behalf of Republic Airlines in the Lockheed Air Terminal refund proceeding.Republic, which is now owned by Northwest, was an end-user of Lockheed'saviation fuel and was therefore presumed to have suffered injury as a resultof Lockheed's alleged overcharges. Based on the amount by which Republicwas allegedly overcharged, the DOE determined that Northwest was due arefund of $31,695 ($17,919 principal and $13,776 interest).<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Marine Petroleum Company and Mars Oil Company/J.D. Streett andamp; Company;Emro Marketing Company, 6/15/88; RF139-15, RF139-18</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning Applications for Refundfiled by J.D. Streett andamp; Company and Emro Marketing Company in the MarinePetroleum Company and Mars Oil Company special refund proceeding. The firmsare resellers who limited their refund requests to $5,000 in principalor less and were, therefore, presumed to have been injured. The DOE determinedthat the firms should receive refunds totalling $12,977, representing $7,421in principal and $5,556 in interest. The refund granted J.D. Streett andamp;Company was placed in an interest-bearing escrow account pending the outcomeof an enforcement proceeding involving the firm.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corporation/Fultroop Service Station et al., 6/17/88; RF225-58et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision granting eight Applications for Refund from theMobil Oil Corporation escrow account filed by retailers resellers, andend-users of Mobil refined petroleum products. Each applicant elected toapply for a refund based upon the presumptions set forth in <T3>Mobil Oil Corp.,</T3> 13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985). The DOE grantedrefunds totalling $26,433 ($21,211 principal plus $5,222 interest).<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corporation/Monroe Holt, 6/17/88; RF225-11035, RF225-11036</T3>The DOE issued a Decision granting an additional refund of $198 to MonroeHolt from the Mobil Oil Corp. escrow account. Holt received a second refundbecause Mobil was able to provide gallonage figures for a gas station forwhich Holt no longer maintained records. Holt met the requirements setforth in <T3>Mobil Oil Corp.</T3>, 13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985), and therefore receivedan additional refund of $198 ($159 in principal and $39 in interest).<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp./Smith Oil Co., Inc., </T3><T3>6/17/88; RF225-8767, RF225-8768, RF225-8769, RF225-8770</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refundfiled by Smith Oil Co., Inc., in the Mobil Oil Corp. special refund proceeding.<T3>See Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985). Smith, a reseller-retailerof refined petroleum products, attempted to rebut the level-of-distributionpresumption of injury for its purchases of Mobil motor gasoline. Afterexamining the firm's cost banks and applying a three-part competitive disadvantagetest, the DOE concluded that Smith should receive a full volumetric refundon its motor gasoline purchases. Smith also claimed a refund on its middledistillate purchases from Mobil. The firm, however, did not attempt todemonstrate injury with regard to its middle distillate purchases. Therefore,that portion of its claim was denied. The total refund granted to Smithwas $6,416, representing $5,148 in principal and $1,268 in accrued interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Pennzoil Co./West Virginia, 6/15/88; RM10-110</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order approving the Motion for Modificationfiled by the State of West Virginia in the second stage of the PannzoilCo. special refund proceeding. West Virginia requested permission to use$72,317 of its previously-approved Pennzoil funds for traffic light synchronizationprograms in four locations and for the continuation of its interstate highwayprogram. The DOE found that West Virginia's programs were consistent withprograms that the DOE approved in the past, and therefore approved theState's proposed modifications.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Pinellas Suncoast/Transit Authority, 6/13/88; RF272-3504</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refundfrom crude oil overcharge funds based on the Applicant's purchases of refinedpetroleum products from Auguat 19, 1973, through January 27, 1981. TheApplicant used actual invoices to calculate its volume claim. Part of theclaim was based on transmission fluid. The DOE determined that transmissionfluid is derived from petroleum and is an eligible product in these proceedings.The DOE further determined that the Applicant should be presumed injuredbecause it was an end-user of the gallons claimed. The refund granted inthis Decision is $295.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Polcyn Farms et al., </T3><T3>6/13/88; RF272-5288 et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting refunds from crude oil overchargefunds to four applicants based on their purchases of refined petroleumproducts during the period August 19, 1973, through January 27, 1981. Eachapplicant used the products for various agricultural activities and calculatedits volume claim either by consulting actual purchase records or by estimatingits consumption based on the acres it farmed. Each applicant was an end-userof the products it claimed and was therefore found injured based upon theend-user presumption of injury. The sum of the refunds granted in thisDecision is $45.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Seward andamp; Harris Gin Co. Seward andamp; Harris, 6/15/88; RF272-2364,RF72-2365</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting refunds from crude oil overchargefunds to two applicants based on their respective purchases of refinedpetroleum products during the period August 19, 1973, through January 27,1981. Seward andamp; Harris Gin Co. used propane to operate its public cottongin and Seward andamp; Harris used various petroleum products in agriculturalactivities associated with the cultivation of cotton. Seward andamp; HarrisGin Co. consulted actual fuel supplier invoices to determine its propanegallonage. Seward andamp; Harris estimated its consumption based on the numberof acres it farmed. Both applicants were end-users of the products theyclaimed and were therefore presumed by the DOE to have been injured. Thesum of the refunds granted in this Decision is $243. Both of the claimantswill be eligible for additional refunds as additional crude oil overchargefunds become available.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Townsend Bros., Inc., 6/13/88; RF272-1133</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refundfrom crude oil overcharge funds based on the Applicant's purchases of motorgasoline and propane during the period August 19, 1973 through January27, 1981 (Settlement Period). Because the Applicant lacked gallonage figures,it based its claim on its gasoline and propane expenditures for the SettlementPeriod. Consequently, the DOE divided the Applicant's gasoline and propaneexpenditures by weighted average prices for gasoline and propane that theDOE accepted as reasonable in prior crude oil cases. As an end-user, theApplicant was entitled to receive a refund of its full volumetric share.The refund granted in this Decision is $43.<ITAG tagnum="84">Dismissals</ITAG>The following submissions were dismissed:<ITAG tagnum="73">Name, and Case No. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Don E.
