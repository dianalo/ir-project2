Spooked by the Middle East crisis, investors are yankingmoney out of stock funds and stuffing their cash into drabbut safe money market funds.</LP><TEXT>   Two months ago, stock fund sales were on target for theirbest year ever, topping even the banner year 1986. But inJuly, the flow of dollars into stock funds slowed to atrickle, and this month money started cascading out of stockfunds.   August has been &quot;the worst month since October 1987 {whenthe stock market crashed} in terms of net outflows&quot; fromstock funds, Gavin Quill, a marketing research analyst withScudder, Stevens andamp; Clark, said. &quot;It was pretty much spreadacross the board.&quot; Other fund groups also reported dismalstock fund sales during August, though they pale beside the$7.5 billion net outflow of October 1987.   For much of this year, stock funds have pulled in morecash than they surrendered to departing shareholders. In May,inflows hit a frenzied peak of $4.4 billion, the fundindustry's best month since April 1987. But according to theInvestment Company Institute, inflows in June slowed to $1.7billion, and stock funds in July pulled in a modest $131million. These numbers include sales, less redemptions, plusthe net effect of switches between stock funds and otherfunds in the same fund family. Reinvested dividends areexcluded.   In August, the slowdown in stock fund sales seems to haveturned into a rout. Dalbar Financial Services of Bostonestimated that stock funds hemorrhaged about $1.8 billion inassets during August. Dalbar's estimate is a projection basedon data from 112 stock funds, which represent 1/10th of theindustry's stock fund assets.   Stock fund investors have a reputation as lousy markettimers. They tend to buy like crazy near stock market peaks,and sell heavily after the market has already fallen steeply.   Dalbar Financial President Louis Harvey reckons that thismonth's stock fund outflows may prove equally ill-timed.&quot;Many of the people who switched on the bad news are probablyalready sorry,&quot; he said. &quot;The people who move are almostinvariably making the wrong move. The best bet is abuy-and-hold strategy.&quot;   Mr. Harvey noted that those investors who buy stock fundsdirectly from fund groups, rather than going through a brokerand paying a commission, seem to have been the quickest tobail out of stock funds in August. The broker-sold fundgroups, by contrast, survived relatively unscathed.&quot;Surprisingly, it's been a booming month for equities,&quot; saidHenry Schmelzer, an executive vice president with New EnglandSecurities, which has funds that are sold through insuranceagents.   Robert Leo, director of mutual funds at the ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc. unit of American Express Co., said newsales of stock funds are down 40% this month, but redemptionsand exchanges out of stock funds are up only modestly. &quot;Wehave had a net outflow {from stock funds}, but nothing ofextraordinary dimensions,&quot; Mr. Leo said. &quot;Many of the bigfund groups like Vanguard and T. Rowe Price and Fidelity areseeing a lot of switches. These people often don't usebrokers. Our investors are longer term. We haven't seen a lotof exchanges.&quot;   But while there has been heavy switching out of stockfunds at the three fund groups mentioned by Mr. Leo, eventhese firms have something to cheer about.   &quot;If you look at the business as a whole, it's been a goodmonth,&quot; Michael Hines, a marketing vice president atBoston-based Fidelity Investments, said. &quot;Though we've seennet redemptions {out of stock funds}, our research shows thatpeople still plan to invest in equities in the months ahead.&quot;   At T. Rowe Price Associates, Baltimore, much of the moneycoming out of its stock funds went into the firm's moneymarket funds. As a result, T. Rowe Price only had a modestoutflow of assets from the fund group overall.   At Scudder, more than 90% of the money that went out ofstock funds ended up in another Scudder fund. By contrast,Scudder managed to hang on to only half the money that leftstock funds in October 1987. &quot;What you find on the moneymarket side {during August} is the mirror image of whathappened elsewhere,&quot; Scudder's Mr. Quill said. &quot;Net, as afamily of funds, we gained very slightly.&quot;   Not all stock funds hemorrhaged assets. Vanguard Group'sstock-index funds picked up new money in August, as did itsenergy and gold sector funds. Franklin Resources' gold fundhad strong new sales, but also was hurt by large exchangesout of the fund. &quot;You tend to get faster money with the goldfund, particularly with the market timers,&quot; Gregory Johnson,a marketing vice president at Franklin, said.   According to the Investment Company Institute, stock fundmanagers turned slightly more bullish in July, cutting theircash positions to 10.7% of assets from 10.8% in June. Numbersgathered by Indata, a service of Gordon, Haskett andamp; Co.,indicate this trend didn't last. Indata, which keeps tabs on57 stock mutual funds with assets of $20 billion, said thecash position at these 57 funds now is at 11.6%, up from10.2% at the end of July.   During July, bond funds pulled in $1.7 billion more thanthey surrendered to departing shareholders, the third monthin a row of net inflows. But in August, bond funds appear tohave bled assets. Massachusetts Financial Services, T. RowePrice and Vanguard all reported net outflows from their bondfunds.   Investors fearing a recession pulled money out ofhigh-yielding &quot;junk&quot; bond funds in August. T. Rowe Price HighYield Fund, which had been the firm's best-selling bond fundfor the previous three months, was the biggest loser inAugust. Massachusetts Financial, Shearson and Vanguard alsoreported net outflows from their junk funds.   While money flowed out of junk funds, it flowed into fundsthat buy bonds that are of higher quality or have shortermaturities. But during August, the biggest winner of all hasbeen the money market funds, which buy Treasury bills and thevery short-term corporate IOUs known as commercial paper.Much of the money switched out of bond and stock funds hasended up in money market funds.   Though fund groups are pleased to keep money in the fundfamily, burgeoning money market funds are a mixed blessingfor them. &quot;Money funds are less profitable than long-termfunds,&quot; Avi Nachmany, an analyst with Jesup andamp; Lamont Inc.,said. &quot;If you get into an environment of a sustained shiftfrom long-term funds to short-term funds, you'll get adecline in profitability.&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          STOCK MUTUAL FUNDS lost an estimated $1.8 billion inassets in August, mainly because of investors' switching toother funds. If the estimate proves correct, the loss wouldbe the worst since February 1989. The historical comparisonwas misstated in the headline of an article in Friday'sedition.
