Bentsen,who was wrapping up a three-day swing through his home state on</FIRST><SECOND>aturday, then making a quick trip to a Navajo reservation inNew</SECOND><TEXT>   Mexico.   ``George Bush may try to run away from his running mate, but hereally can't hide,'' said Bentsen, who called the selection ofQuayle ``a big mistake.''   ``While the Republicans are running from the issues, and runningfrom Dan Quayle, we don't intend to let them change the tune; we'regoing to see that they face the music,'' Bentsen said.   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis has been facingthe music in Texas on the issues of crime and gun control in abarrage of Republican ads portraying him as a coddler of criminalswho wants to disarm honest citizens. Bentsen attacked what he saidwere distortions of Dukakis' record, and said Texas would seethrough them.   ``Texans won't buy a bill of goods on gun control from a man whowanted to sell Hawk missiles to the ayatollah,'' he said.   Bentsen denied Republican assertions that the Democrats hadgiven up on*wnnning the South.   ``That is obviously not true. It sounds like some of hiscomments during the debate. Not true at all,'' he said.   ``I was in North Carolina the other day and they tell me we'reahead there. I was in Tennessee, they said that's a dead heat. Ithink we're ahead in Arkansas. We've seen a nice improvement herein Texas (where) the momentum is back in our direction,'' he said,citing a recent poll showing the ticket only five points behind.   Bentsen also discussed his relationship with the late PresidentJohn F. Kennedy, which some have questioned since Bentsen said thatthey were friends. He said that during the debate just beforetelling Quayle he was ``no Jack Kennedy.''   Bentsen, who served in the House with Kennedy, said he was theMassachusetts senator's finance chairman in Houston when Kennedyran for presid`.w. He also said he received from Kennedy aninscribed copy of his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ``Profiles inCourage.''   Kennedy invited him to his wedding, Bentsen said, but he wasalready scheduled to make a speech in south Texas and missed it.   ``If I had knor.#he was going to be president, I'd have gone,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
