In another development, the Roman Catholic priest who escapedinjury when thugs massacred his parishioners three weeks ago madehis first public comment on the attack Wednesday and applauded theHaitian soldiers' rebellion.   The merchants, who in Haiti resell merchandise bought in theDominican Republic, claim the incidents occurred from Sept. 26 toOct. 1. Most of the incidents occurred at Barahona, a small town insouthwestern Dominican Republic near the Haitian border.   The merchants claimed the Dominicans said it was ``a specialcontrol'' measure ordered by Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer.An unidentified witness alleged the soldiers pointed their riflesat them and confiscated the goods to sell them.   In a recorded radio address broadcast by local stations, theRev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide paid tribute to the 13 parishioners whodied and the more than 70 who were wounded Sept. 11 when men withguns, machetes and metal skewers attacked his St. Jean Bosco church.   ``Like Jesus Christ, the victims of the massacre of St. JeanBosco fell in a bloodbath of love for the liberation of theircountry,'' Aristide said.   Aristide, an advocate of Marxist liberation theology who hasbeen condemned by the church hierarchy, saluted ``the valiantsoldiers who have decided to continue the house-cleaningoperation.''   But he did not praise Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, the country's newleader, associating him with other officiers linked to the Duvalierregimes of the past.   ``The people do not trust you; (the people) should consider allbigshot Duvalierists as big-time criminals until they prove thecontrary for the rest of their lives,'' he said in remarksaddressed to Avril.   Rank-and-file soldiers of the Presidential Guard, upset by thechurch massacre and other government-sponsored violence, overthrewmilitary ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy on Sept. 17 and sent him intoexile in the Dominican Republic. They named Avril as his successorand accused Namphy and Port-au-Prince Mayor Mayor Franck Romain ofmasterminding the massacre.   The enlisted men ousted many of their unpopular commandingofficers in the week following the coup, while the general populacehunted down, stoned to death and burned a number of Tonton Macoutesbelieved responsible for the church massacre.   The Macoutes are former members of the private militia of theDuvalier family dictatorship that ruled Haiti for 29 years untilJean-Claude Duvalier was ousted and exiled in February 1986.   Avril has been identified for years as a staunch Duvalierist andbecame a multimillionaire as financial advisor to the dictator'sfamily.</TEXT></DOC>
