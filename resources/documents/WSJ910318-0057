A small group of contrarian economists believes theconventional wisdom is fundamentally flawed. They think theCanadian dollar will continue to trade at current levels thisyear, and appreciate in years to come, despite predictionsfrom most of their colleagues that the opposite will happen.</LP><TEXT>   The importance of interest rates spreads to the value ofthe Canadian dollar is &quot;grossly overstated,&quot; said SusanClark, chief economist with Richardson Greenshields of CanadaLtd. &quot;When you look at the Canadian dollar and any spread,short or long, over any significant period of time, it's hardto conclude that there's a relationship.&quot;   Ms. Clark expects the Canadian dollar to average 85.75U.S. cents this year and she may increase that forecast ifthe currency doesn't fall off a bit soon.   &quot;As far as I can figure out, the case against the{Canadian} dollar is purely based on spreads and that's onlyone of six or seven factors,&quot; she said.   &quot;This is more than a spread-driven currency,&quot; agreed PattiCroft, economist at Burns Fry Ltd. &quot;We've already seenshort-term spreads come in.&quot;   Last May, Canadian short-term interest rates peaked at13.77%, about 5.80 percentage points higher than U.S. rates.The Canadian dollar was trading at about 84.5 cents. OnFriday, short-term rates were down to 9.67%, the spread hadnarrowed to about 3.70 and the Canadian dollar was trading at86.5 cents.   Ms. Croft sees some near-term volatility for the currencybut expects the Canadian dollar to continue appreciating overthe longer term. She said one of the main factors is thatforeign direct investment in Canada continues to be strong.   Preliminary figures for 1990 show that net foreignpurchases of bonds in Canada were higher than purchases inthe U.S., even though the U.S. market is about seven timeslarger than the Canadian market, Ms. Croft said. That has a&quot;tremendous impact on currency,&quot; she said.   Ms. Croft also pointed to the Government of Canada'srecent budget for fiscal 1992. &quot;The inflation targets arevery positive for our currency,&quot; she said.   The Canadian finance department and the Bank of Canadatogether set inflation targets calling for the year-over-yearrise in the consumer price index to slow to 3% by the end of1992 and 2% by the end of 1995. The index rose 6.8% inJanuary from a year earlier.   Ms. Clark said the increased flow of wealthy Hong Kongimmigrants into Canada since 1986 is another reason for theCanadian dollar's strength.   Most economists believe the Canadian dollar would befairly valued at between 78 and 82 U.S. cents. They expectthe Canadian dollar to decline to the 81 to 83 cent level bythe end of 1991 -- the same prediction most made for 1990when the Canadian dollar averaged 86 cents.   Karim Basta, senior economist with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. inNew York, said that over the past year there was an&quot;overwhelming feeling that the Canadian dollar was just goingto fall out of bed&quot; to get Canada out of its economicproblems.   But, he said, the central bank intervened in the marketsmany times, making it clear that the Canadian dollar wouldremain firm and &quot;the market raised its level of confidence.&quot;   Mr. Basta thinks the Canadian dollar is fairly valued atcurrent levels, and he sees the currency trading within the85 to 87 cent range through the end of 1992. The only causeof concern is wage inflation, which makes the Canadian dollara bit expensive at current levels, he said.   Randall A. Powley, vice president of economics atScotia-McLeod Inc., is still bearish on the Canadian dollar,but he said easing by the Federal Reserve in the U.S. hasstalled the currency's decline. &quot;People are looking elsewhereto place their money and the Canadian market looksattractive,&quot; he said. This is &quot;holding things up, but itwon't change the eventual course.&quot;   Scotia-Mcleod recently changed its 1991 forecast to 84cents from 82 cents. Mr. Powley expects the Canadian dollarto fall to about 81 cents in 1992 as Canadian interest ratesfall and spreads narrow. &quot;Spreads are a pretty major factor,&quot;he said.   Mark Mullins, chief economist at Midland Walwyn CapitalInc., said that, as a rule of thumb, a one percentage pointdrop in short-term interest rate spreads equals a one centfall in the Canadian dollar. He said the Canadian dollar hasresisted that rule largely as a result of expectations thatsee a &quot;somewhat rosier picture in Canada coming out of therecession than in the U.S.&quot;   Still, Mr. Mullins believes the Canadian dollar will fall.&quot;Typical spreads coming out of a recession would be 200 basispoints and we're considerably above that now. There's plentyof room for interest rates {and the dollar} to fall.&quot;   In foreign-exchange market activity Friday, the U.S.dollar rose, closing in late New York trading at 1.6069marks, compared with 1.5825 Thursday.
