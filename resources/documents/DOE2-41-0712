The exit methane-rich gas stream,is decomposed to carbon black and a hydrogen-rich gas stream above ground.Part of the hydrogen-rich gas stream is withdrawn as a clean productgas and the remainder is recycled underground to, once again, hydrogenatethe coal underground. Unlike conventional steam gasification of coal,which is an endothermic process requiring either oxygen or air to combustwith coal underground to provide the endothermic heat of reaction, thehydrogenation of coal underground is exothermic which maintains the temperatureof the bed in the reaction between the coal and hydrogen to methane.This process thus, in effect, pumps carbon fuel out of the ground withthe use of hydrogen. Furthermore, it is a much safer system to operatethan the steam-oxygen gasification of underground coal. 2 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
