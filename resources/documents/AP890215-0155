(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Soviet Union ended its costlynine-year intervention in Afghanistan on Wednesday when the lastsoldier _ the commander of the Red Army contingent _ walked across aborder bridge clutching flowers and accompanied by his teen-age son.   ``I wasn't looking back,'' said Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov afterleaving Afghan soil where 15,000 Soviets died in a civil war thatstill rages on.   The pullout through this border town _ where many of the 115,000Soviet troops had entered Afghanistan _ closed a painful chapter inSoviet history that even Mikhail S. Gorbachev once called a``bleeding wound.''   But it did little to silence the critics who said the Kremlin'sDecember 1979 intervention to aid a Marxist government against theMoslem insurgency was a mistake.   About 200 cheering, windburned soldiers clutched automatic riflesas they rode mud-spattered armored personnel carriers across theFriendship Bridge over the Amu Darya River on Wednesday _ theU.N.-mediated deadline for all Soviets to be out of Afghanistan.   Gromov, the 45-year-old commander of the Soviet contingent inAfghanistan, rode the last armored personnel carrier off Afghan soil.   His vehicle stopped halfway across the bridge linking Termez withthe Afghan town of Khairaton, and his 14-year-old son, Maxim, ranout. He gave his father a bouquet of carnations and they walkedarm-in-arm the final yards to Soviet soil.   At the border, the sunburned general appeared to be near tearswhen he said his thoughts were for his countrymen who served or diedin Afghanistan.   ``I thought about those who were left behind, but mostimportantly about those who have come home,'' said Gromov, who tookcommand in Afghanistan in 1984 on his third tour of duty there.   Lt. Col. Igor Azarenok of the Soviet Defense Ministry saidGromov's headquarters group was the last to leave, and the officialnews agency Tass said other troops crossed the border Wednesday atKushka.   In Afghanistan, tens of thousands of guerrillas reportedly wereadvancing on the capital of Kabul and other major cities.   Moslem guerrilla leaders in Islamabad, Pakistan, presented a planfor an interim government in Afghanistan that would be debated inthe coming days.   They would take control of their country swiftly now that theSoviets are gone. Delegates to a special council chanted ``Death tothe Russians!'' and ``God is great!'' as their leaders declared theKremlin had suffered a devastating and humiliating defeat.   The Afghan government Wednesday night thanked the Soviet Unionfor its assistance, but it also said relations between the twoshould develop on the basis of non-interference in each other'sinternal affairs.   The Kremlin, in a statement carried by Tass, thanked the Sovietsoldiers for ``fulfilling your patriotic and internationalistduty.'' But the Communist Party daily Pravda, state-run TV andcommentators questioned whether the Kremlin was correct in sendingtroops into Afghanistan in the first place.   Some of the troops at the border ceremony also said gettinginvolved was a mistake.   ``It was a clear error, so many died,'' said senior Sgt. AsgatHusayinov, 22. He said Afghanistan was ``a hell after which you fearnothing, except maybe yourself.''   The Soviets acknowledged that 15,000 of its soldiers were killedand more than 35,000 wounded in Afghanistan. The U.S. StateDepartment estimates that 1 million Afghans have been killed,including combatants and civilians.   The ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan seized powerin a 1978 Marxist coup, touching off a civil war.   The Kremlin sent in the troops in December 1979 to replace thepro-Moscow government with another. The Soviets have said the latePresident Leonid Brezhnev and a handful of his closest associatesdecided to intervene because the civil war threatened the SovietUnion.   ``It is possible to doubt the Brezhnev leadership's evaluation ofthe level of military threat,'' Pravda said Wednesday. ``Suchvitally important decisions as the use of troops cannot be decidedsecretly by a small circle of people, without the sanction of theparliament.''   Tass raised similar questions.   ``All these years, Afghanistan has probably been the greatestpain and worry for our people,'' the official news agency said.``Scientists, politicians, soldiers and all other people will bethinking and debating for a long time whether the decision of thegovernment of the country taken at that time was right.''   Commentator Alexander Bovin told the Novosti press agency theintervention was a ``tragic mistake.'' Despite officialpronouncements the Kremlin never sought victory in the war, Bovindeclared: ``It has ended in defeat for us, because we've failed tocope with the tasks that brought us there.''   He said the Red Army failed to stabilize the Kabul government anddisarm the guerrillas.   The Soviet government said Afghanistan's future will depend onwhether the guerrilla force ``shows a sense of responsibility,self-restraint and an ability to think not only in terms ofviolence.''   The Kremlin also called on the United States to prevent furtherbloodshed by stopping its arms shipments to the rebels. The SovietUnion reiterated it was prepared to end arms shipments to the Kabulgovernment.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said theend of the Soviet pullout marks ``a long awaited day for the Afghanpeople and they can now go on to determine their own future.'' Hereiterated that U.S. support for the guerrillas will continue.   The United States was the principal supporter of the Moslemguerrillas, but they also were aided by Pakistan, China and Iran.   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in Portugal on a tourof NATO countries, said the Soviets should now help in Afghanistan'sreconstruction.   Soviet TV devoted the first 17 minutes of its evening news show``Vremya'' to the pullout, and a correspondent said the war wouldnot end for mothers who lost their sons and are asking, ``What for?''   Although Gromov described the present situation in Afghanistan ascalm, Soviet officials estimate 30,000 guerrillas are massed aroundKabul, which has been blockaded for months. Foreign Ministryspokesman Vadim Perfiliev said 15,000 guerrillas were aroundJalalabad, and Kabul Radio said insurgents surrounded Herat andKhandahar.   Facing them were 30,000 poorly trained Afghan Army conscripts,with little loyalty to the Soviet-backed Marxist regime in Kabul,according to Western intelligence. Some guerrilla commanders saythey expect fiercer resistance from an estimated 20,000 secretpolice, elite guardsmen, police and armed Communist Party members.   Diego Cordovez, the special U.N. representative for Afghanistanwho negotiated the Soviet withdrawal, said in New York that fewerthan 10 Soviet military advisers remain in Afghanistan.   Literaturnaya Gazeta reported that at one point during the war,Red Army soldiers intentionally ran over a car carrying sevencivilians. It said they fired at the car because its driver hadignored warning shots.   The article implied that all those in the car were killed, eitherby gunfire or when it was run over later by an armored personnelcarrier.   The soldiers had suspected the car was being used by guerrillas,and the soldiers' commander told his men, ``I don't needprisoners,'' according to Literaturnaya Gazeta.   The commander was sentenced to six years in prison but laterfreed in an amnesty, the newspaper said.</TEXT></DOC>
