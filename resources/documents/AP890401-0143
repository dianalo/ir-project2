Under the law, originallydesigned to combat organized crime, the government can seize assetsof defendants before trial, creating intense pressure on them tostrike a plea bargain. Below, and in an accompanying story, twoprominent observers argue the pros and cons of the Milken case.Michael Goldsmith is a legal scholar who consults extensively onRICO matters; Ralph Ingersoll II, chairman of IngersollPublications Co., is a personal friend of Milken's.</TEXT><BYLINE>By MICHAEL GOLDSMITH</BYLINE><BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE><TEXT>   Shed no tears for Michael Milken or his firm, Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc., which has agreed to plead guilty to fraud rather thanface racketeering charges under the federal Racketeer Influencedand Corrupt Organizations law.   These prosecutions have provoked misplaced criticism of the RICOlaw.   RICO critics argue that Drexel was unfairly induced tocapitulate. Supposedly, any other decision would have meant instantruin, since RICO allows assets to be frozen pretrial and forfeitedafter conviction.   No doubt Drexel felt pressured, but stress is inherent in theplea negotiation process. Thus, street criminals often plead guiltyto avoid habitual offender charges. A more important issue iswhether Drexel is guilty. The answer must be yes, for no judge mayaccept a baseless guilty plea. As the defense of ``good faith'' wasreadily available, Drexel's megabuck legal team would not haveadvised a groundless plea. Michael Milken now has the same defense_ and others as well _ under RICO.   Nor was Drexel abused by a pretrial asset freeze. Thisprocedure, incidentally, is not unique to RICO. Other laws providesimilar remedies comparable to bail bonds used to secure personalappearances at trial. No evidence suggests forfeiture wasmaliciously threatened. Moreover, prosecutors may not imposeforfeiture unilaterally. RICO requires proof of probable success attrial and the risk of asset dissipation. Moreover, the court mustconsider various equitable factors. And not all assets may befrozen, only those needed to ensure funds for payoff uponconviction.   The government is also justified in seeking forfeiture.Forfeiture takes the profit out of crime, a penalty that works wellagainst corporations which cannot be jailed. In Milken's case, thealleged profits would make successful drug dealers envious. Surelythe narcotics crisis is not to be solved by encouraging drugdealers to turn to securities fraud.   Congress reserved RICO for criminals who engage in a PATTERN ofracketeering _ a requirement courts take seriously. Violators,therefore, merit special sanctions. White collar defendants claimto be unfairly stigmatized by the term racketeer. Perhaps``swindler'' is more apt, but Congress properly considered whitecollar crimes to be racketeering. The legislative record is repletewith references to corrupt businesses, including brokerage firms.   Critics want to limit RICO to the Mafia. But white collar crimeexacts equally serious social costs, and, constitutionally, weought not tolerate efforts to confine racketeering laws to anyethnic group.   Thus, though the case against Milken remains to be proven, ifguilt is established, the RICO penalty would fit the crime.</TEXT><TEXT>   Professor Michael Goldsmith of Brigham Young University isVice-Chairman of the American Bar Association's Criminal JusticeSection RICO Committee and consults extensively on RICO matters.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday, April 3</NOTE></DOC>
