The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston said it has askedFleet, based in Providence, R.I., to provide information onloans to, and loan purchases from, a number of lenders whoseactivities in Boston have been sharply criticized bycommunity activists.</LP><TEXT>   Although the Fed stopped short of calling its review aninvestigation, its action indicates the activists' concernsare being taken seriously. A Boston hotel workers union hasfiled a regulatory objection with the Fed to Fleet's proposedpurchase of Bank of New England Corp., alleging that Fleet'spractices harm minorities. The purchase is scheduled to closeJuly 1.   &quot;We're simply trying to understand the facts here, andwhat connection, if any, there is&quot; with Fleet, said ThomasCimeno, senior vice president for supervision at the FederalReserve in Boston. &quot;It has been suggested that certain bankholding companies, including Fleet, acquired paper,&quot; orloans, made by the second-mortgage companies. Mr. Cimenodeclined to name the lenders under scrutiny.   Robert W. Lougee Jr., a Fleet spokesman, declined commenton the Fed's inquiries, and said the bank didn't have arequest from the Fed as yet. The bank has said in the pastthat it has a good record of community lending, and hasn'tbeen very active in Boston.   Local 26 of the Hotel Restaurant Institutional Employeesunion has alleged that a number of lenders have madesecond-mortgage loans to inner-city residents at rates ofabout 20%, then foreclosed or seized their homes whenpayments couldn't be made, and profited from resales. Theunion has also said that some of the borrowers, who used themoney for home improvements, were turned down as poor risksby big banks, who at the same time were financing themortgage companies.   Fleet has acknowledged extending $7.5 million in credit toone of the lenders criticized by the union, ResourcesNortheast Inc., but says it terminated its relationship withthe company last year. Officials of Resources Northeastcouldn't be reached for comment.   Fleet told a congressional hearing last week that afterResources Northeast had financial difficulties, the bankseized collateral on 38 loans, 12 in greater Boston, and onlyone in &quot;a low or moderate income area.&quot; Mr. Lougee said thatFleet has no direct mortgage lending operation inMassachusetts, and purchased none of Resources Northeast'sloans. Mr. Lougee says Fleet holds a total of only 321 loansin the state, with only a small portion in Boston.</TEXT></DOC>
