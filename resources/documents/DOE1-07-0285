<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-07-0285 </DOCNO><TEXT>This document chronicles a total of 87 reactor event descriptions foruse by operator licensing examiners in the construction of simulatorscenarios. Events are organized into four categories: (1) boiling-waterreactor abnormal events; (2) boiling-water reactor emergency events;(3) pressurized-water reactor abnormal events; and (4) pressurized-waterreactor emergency events. Each event described includes a cover sheetand a progression of operator actions flow chart. The cover sheet containsthe following general information: initial plant state, sequence initiator,important plant parameters, major plant systems affected, tolerance ranges,final plant state, and competencies tested. The progression of operatoractions flow chart depicts, in a flow chart manner, the representativesequence(s) of expected immediate and subsequent candidate actions, includingcommunications, that can be observed during the event. These descriptionsare intended to provide examiners with a reliable, performance-basedsource of information from which to design simulator scenarios that willprovide a valid test of the candidates' ability to safely and competentlyperform all licensed duties and responsibilities.</TEXT></DOC>
