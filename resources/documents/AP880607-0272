An investigation by the House commerce, consumer and monetaryaffairs subcommittee, whose results were made available Tuesday,concluded that of 609 suspected insider-trading cases referred bythe stock exchanges to the SEC in 1986 and 1987, about 225 involvedforeign trading.   Of the 225, the SEC pursued only 57, the study said.   ``With the growing internationalization of securities markets,there is deepening concern that both foreign citizens and Americanswill be able to use foreign accounts to trade illegally in ourmarkets by utilizing insider trading information or manipulating themarket, and that the SEC may be unable to properly investigate suchtrading,'' subcommittee Chairman Doug Barnard Jr., D-Ga., said in astatement.   According to the study's findings, the nation's stock exchangesoften take a long time to report suspicious transactions to the SEC.The New York Stock Exchange takes an average of one year to givesuch information to the SEC and has taken up to 28 months, the panelconcluded.   New York exchange spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin said she would notchallenge the figures in the report, but said the exchange conductsits own investigations and is trying to speed the process it uses togather and report information on unusual transactions.   The investigation concluded that the SEC does not pursue casesinvolving Panama, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein and other countries withwhom the commission lacks information-sharing agreements.   The subcommittee also found that the SEC has been looking intosuspected instances of insider-trading involving InternationalBusiness Machines Corp., Textron Inc., Sperry Corp. and othercompanies.   Barnard, whose subcommittee scheduled a hearing on the subjectfor Wednesday, said in his statement that the SEC has given a lowpriority to international enforcement by assigning only two peopleto its Office of International Legal Assistance.   SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue declined to comment on the study,saying commission Chairman David S. Ruder would testify atWednesday's hearing.   But in Tuesday's edition of the Wall Street Journal, whichinitially reported the subcommittee's findings, Gary Lynch, theSEC's enforcement chief, said of the commission's internationalefforts: ``We've been very aggressive, and have made remarkablestrides in the last several years.''   The SEC on Tuesday released a draft of proposed legislationdesigned to increase its ability to combat insider-trading and othersecurities law violations by foreigners.   The bill would give the SEC authority to issue subpoenas and taketestimony in the United States on behalf of foreign securitiesregulators with the idea that other countries, in turn, wouldprovide the same assistance to the SEC.</TEXT></DOC>
