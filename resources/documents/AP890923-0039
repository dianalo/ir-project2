Vietnamese soldiers, meanwhile, received gifts and were serenadedat a farewell ceremony.   In Bangkok, Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan said thatafter meetings in the past two weeks, Cambodia's three mainguerrilla factions and Premier Hun Sen agreed to future talks afternegotiations failed in Paris last month.   The time and place for the talks had yet to be fixed, Chatichaisaid at a news conference.   There was no immediate comment from the guerrillas or theCambodian government.   However, Chatichai said Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the leader of acoalition of guerrillas, had suggested that the meeting be held inBangkok, Jakarta or Paris.   ``We cannot let the Cambodian fighting go on any longer. If acivil war happens Thailand will have to bear a greater burden ofCambodian refugees,'' he said.   Already about 300,000 refugees live along the Cambodian-Thaiborder.   A Soviet military adviser was quoted today as saying theCambodian government and Khmer Rouge guerrillas have thrown theirbest troops into heavy fighting for a gem-rich town near the border.   The Soviet adviser said Khmer Rouge troops succeeded incontrolling the ridge and mountains around the city of Pailin butthat they had not taken the town, located about 140 miles northwestof Phnom Penh and known for ruby mines in the area.   The adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said most ofthe town's residents had fled or been evacuated and that fightingwas fierce. His remarks, made in Russian in an interview with anEast European reporter, were made available to The Associated Press.   The adviser said Cambodia's 196th Division, apparently its best,was fighting with the 302nd Division of the Khmer Rouge, a forceformed in 1978 to serve as bodyguards for high-ranking Khmer Rougeleaders when tensions with Vietnam were mounting.   Soviet-backed Vietnam has been supporting the communistgovernment in Pnom Penh while China has backed the Khmer Rouge, whogoverned from 1975 until 1978 and tried to carry out an agrarianrevolution that killed hundreds of thousands of people before theVietnamese invaded.   There was no way to immediately confirm the adviser's report.   Friday, Cambodian Deputy Defense Minister Gen. Ke Kim Yan said upto 450 Khmer Rouge guerrillas were trying to carve out a ``liberatedzone'' around Pailin, and had intensified 120mm mortar shelling,firing up to 2,000 rounds a day.   The Cambodian resistance group, led militarily by the KhmerRouge, has its bases near the Thai border, in Thailand and inCambodia. It receives the bulk of its arms via Thailand from China.   For the past three days, festive gatherings have been held acrossCambodia marking what Vietnam says is the withdrawal of the last26,000 troops it sent since invading in December 1979 to oust theKhmer Rouge.   Guerrillas say the pullout, which Vietnam promises to complete byTuesday, is a sham. Observers say they believe the movement islargely genuine.   Crowds of villagers, holding placards reading ``Welcome, thewithdrawal Vietnamese troops from Cambodia,'' applauded and cheeredin unison after patriotic speeches by Cambodian and Vietnameseofficials.   Some Vietnamese officers were presented with gifts and leis offlowers. One officer was given a large portrait of the lateVietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh sitting with Tou Samuth, one of thefounders of the Cambodian Communist Party.   A band, dressed in dirty white uniforms, played throughout,cranking out off-key renditions of the national anthems of Vietnamand Cambodia.   Vietnamese soldiers interviewed during the festivities said theywere looking forward to going home but that they were concerned fortheir future.   ``I hope to go home and stay in the military,'' said Nguyen Son,from Can Tho province in Vietnam. ``But I am an enlisted man and mycountry wants to cut our armed forces.''   Vietnam has said it wants to cut the size of its military, whichbecause of its expense, has contributed to the country's economicdifficulties. Son, 22, said that if he can't stay in the army hewill return to his village and farm.   The withdrawal is to end Vietnam's involvement in the decade-longwar that left more than 25,000 Vietnamese soldiers dead and itseconomy in tatters.   The guerrillas charge that Vietnam actually is leaving its troopsbehind in various disguises.   That is not possible, said John McAuliff, the American observerfrom the U.S.-Indochina Reconciliation Project, a Philadelphia-basedprivate group.   ``It is just physically impossible for Vietnamese troops to stayin this country in the quantities that would be needed'' withoutbeing seen by the many foreign aid officials in Cambodia and on theThai-Cambodian border, he said.   ``I won't report that I have proof of a complete withdrawal, butwe believe that Vietnam is withdrawing all its troops,'' said BaliRam Bhagat, a former Indian foreign minister representing India'sgoverning party.</TEXT></DOC>
