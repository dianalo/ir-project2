The following taskshave been identified in the project: (1) Conversion vs. time studiesduring sulfidation and regeneration; (2) Pore structure evolution studiesduring sulfidation and regeneration; (3) Intraparticle diffusion studies;(4) Development of structural models for hot coal gas desulfurizationsorbents; and (5) Development of mathematical models for fixed-bed desulfurizationreactors. During the fourth quarter of the 1987 calendar year, our researchefforts primarily focused on Tasks 1 and 5. Preliminary reactivity experimentswere carried out using the thermogravimetric analysis system that isavailable in our laboratory. Our experiments were conducted using zincoxide (research grade) powder and air-hydrogen sulfide mixtures. Ourexperiments revealed a number of problems which we are currently tryingto resolve. The fixed-bed desulfurization model that we developed duringthe previous reporting period was applied to the analysis of fixed-beddesulfurization reactors loaded with ZnO pellets. Our results showedthat the pore size distribution of the ZnO pellets plays a major rolein determining the transient behavior of the reactor and, therefore,the utilization of the sorbent per run. Reactors loaded with pelletsof the same initial porosity and internal surface area may exhibit markedlydifferent breakthrough times if the pore size distributions of the pelletsare not the same. 15 refs., 3 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
