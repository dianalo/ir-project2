The parent is considering a spinoff of Flexi-Van in a rights offering to Castle andamp; Cooke common and convertible preferred holders. Flexi-Van leases road and rail chassis. Castle andamp; Cooke also has interests in food production and real estate development.    The redemption &quot;would be helpful&quot; in preparing for the proposed spinoff, a Castle andamp; Cooke spokesman said.    At last week's annual meeting, Castle andamp; Cooke Chairman David H. Murdock said the spinoff would be considered by the board. Castle andamp; Cooke's cash flow and financial condition have improved since 1985, when the company was merged with Flexi-Van, Mr. Murdock said, and Castle andamp; Cooke &quot;no longer needs Flexi-Van's financial support.&quot;    Castle andamp; Cooke previously announced plans to redeem about $54 million of collateral trust debentures June 15. </TEXT></DOC>
