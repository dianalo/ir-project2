The work stoppage halted service on much of the national railnetwork. In addition, the 12th one-day walkout in 16 weeks byLondon subway workers shut down the London Underground.   The strikers are demanding higher wages.   Thousands of commuters walked, cycled or jogged to work.Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson walked 1{ miles to Parliament.   Two royal parks in London, Hyde Park and Regent's Park, servedas emergency parking lots.   British Rail said Wednesday that 12,500 of the National Union ofRailwaymen's 75,000 employees showed up for work, but just 400 ofits normal 16,000 rail services operated.   The union said British Rail's figures on strikebreakers wereinflated, but it did not offer estimates of its own.   The first three trains into London carried just 15 passengers,and rail union leader Jimmy Knapp mocked British Rail's attempts tobreak the strike.   ``It's a pitiful return for the amount of money, time and effortthey spent over the past week trying to persuade, cajole andthreaten people back into work,'' Knapp said.   Commuter Douglas Wallace said he was the only person to boardthe train at his local station at Hither Green, seven milessoutheast of London.   ``I was the only passenger standing at the station, and when itarrived, they said, `This is a train for you. Get on it,''' he said.   The rail union paid for advertisements in several newspapersTuesday seeking to boost flagging support among its members.   The Financial Times business daily quoted some rail workers assaying they wanted to accept management's offer of an 8.8 percentincrease in basic pay. The union is seeking a 10 percent increasein the basic wage of $188 a week.   The 8.8 percent offer has been accepted by two other railwayunions.   Subway workers are seeking a $103 weekly pay raise to operatesubway trains without conductors. Management has offered $48 a weekplus extra vacation time, but it is demanding increased production.   About 9,400 dockworkers at London ports have been on strikesince July 10. Port officials say the strike is crumbling, withonly 37 of the 60 ports involved still idled.   The dock strike began after Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher'sConservative government abolished a jobs-for-life guarantee,enacted in 1947, for dockers at the 60 ports.   A major cause of the labor unrest has been Britain's annualinflation rate of 8.3 percent, the highest in the 12-nationEuropean Economic Community.</TEXT></DOC>
