Analytical dependences and illustrating material- the result of calculations of the working process in the source - permittingto determine current characteristics of the source depending on the characteristicionizer channel sizes, temperature conditions of its operation and themode of lithium supply to the ionizer are presented. It is shown thatthe mode of thermal ionization in volume under certain limits of lithiumyield through the source can be turned out to be competitive (by thelevel of values of the ionization degree and current density) with respectto the mode of ion-formation absence in volume. 2 refs.; 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
