(products).andO;Product:   DeScribe Word Publisher 1.1 (Word processing software).andO;Topic:     EvaluationDesktop PublishingWord Processing Software.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>DeScribe Gives You a Reason to Use OS/2 RegularlyandM;I -- and about a thousand others -- always have said OS/2 would be seriouscompetition for MS-DOS when its applications did more than simply imitatetheir MS-DOS counterparts.andM;DeScribe does that.andP;  It is the first product I have seen that makes me wantto use OS/2 regularly.andP;  Although MS-DOS, Windows and Macintosh products domany of the same things, none has achieved the power and scope of this wordprocessor-page-layout-drawing-development tool the company calls a &quot;wordpublisher.&quot;andM;Because this program follows the Government Printing Office-mandated StandardGeneralized Markup Language (SGML), it should be doubly welcome to thosefederal offices needing a desktop publishing package under OS/2.andP;  It costs$425 on the General Services Administration Schedule C, about what mostfull-featured word processors cost.andM;It is not a small program, needing at least 3M RAM but wanting 4M or more.andO;Nor is it particularly easy to install.andP;  Installation instructions are not inthe manual.andP;  They are on a single, hard-to-find sheet of paper stuck in thebox with a sheaf of advertisements and update notices.andM;Installation is more of the &quot;what you don't know can't hurt you&quot; type.andP;  About20 minutes into the process, it failed without explanation.andP;  It stopped twicemore at about the same place.andP;  I decided the problem was an overcrowded harddisk, so I erased about 5M.andP;  The next attempt succeeded, but I do not thinkDeScribe can take much credit.andM;It was worth the hassle.andP;  The word-processing portion of this program is muchlike Microsoft Word on the Mac but for the most part uses the power ofPresentation Manager and OS/2 to go a step beyond.andP;  For example, you can copyand paste into the clipboard just like a Mac.andP;  You also can copy separatesegments of text into the same clipboard and paste everything at once.andM;The package also has a Mac-like undo feature.andP;  But this one lets you scrollthrough a user-defined number of actions and choose which ones to undo orredo.andP;  This is handy when you want to move corrected text back where it camefrom.andM;The spell check, dictionary and thesaurus features are easy to operate andlet you create your own supplemental dictionaries for specialty fields.andO;DeScribe also sells more than 20 foreign language and professionaldictionaries as supplements.andM;Striking FeaturesandM;Probably the most striking feature of this program is its customizability.andO;You can delete entire pull-down menus from the main menu and add new ones intheir place.andP;  If you run out of space on the top menu line, DeScribeobligingly adds a second.andM;The macro capabilities are extremely extensive.andP;  You can use the quicker&quot;record&quot; feature to save your actions as a macro or use DeScribe's verypowerful macro programming language to create them from scratch.andP;  The programincludes about 50 macros to get you started, ranging from time managementclocks to mail merge sequences.andP;  You can add macros to the main menu and runthem just as you would regular program features.andM;The program's appearance can be modified extensively.andP;  This is important,because DeScribe starts out with an eye-killing insect-blood greenbackground.andP;  I quickly changed mine to a more acceptable dusky burgundy.andM;The program developers seem to understand the multitasking and multiusercapabilities of OS/2.andP;  In a work group environment, for example, it often isnecessary to prevent modifications to parts of a document, leaving othersections open to correction.andP;  DeScribe's protect feature does exactly that.andO;Protected text shows up in a different color and cannot be altered without apassword.andM;You can split the screen vertically or horizontally to look at differentparts of the same document simultaneously or shrink it to view other activedocuments and applications.andP;  This is particularly useful when you use theLINK commands, which activate OS/2's dynamic data exchange (DDE) between oneor more programs.andM;DeScribe treats elements of a document, such as text blocks, drawings andcharts, as separate objects.andP;  Each can be linked to its source file.andP;  Forexample, you could use Lotus 1-2-3 to create a spreadsheet, import it intoDeScribe and link both files.andP;  Changes made to the spreadsheet would updatethe DeScribe document automatically.andP;  The same can be done to any importedobject.andM;It sounds wonderful but requires a different mind-set than most MS-DOS userspossess.andP;  For one thing, not all DDE applications are equal.andP;  Ideally, allapplications should be able to send, modify and receive linked data.andP;  But afew applications can act only as servers, meaning they can modify and sendbut not accept.andP;  Others act only as clients, accepting information withoutbeing able to edit or send it back.andM;DeScribe is one of these.andP;  You cannot modify any imported and linked datainside DeScribe unless you turn the link off.andP;  Also, remember that yourlinked document needs all its server applications and linked data files todisplay properly.andP;  This is a powerful feature, and DeScribe exploits it well.andM;The program supports style sheets well, including the normal font andparagraph attributes but also adding drop capital letters, foreign languageconventions, widow control and columns.andP;  Styles can be saved for use inmultiple documents.andM;DeScribe's page layout capabilities are extensive and mesh well with itsdrawing tools.andP;  Text and graphic objects can be embedded in any page withfull flow control.andM;As in programs like Quark XPress from Quark Inc., Denver, you must createobjects within a movable, resizable window, which is not an obvious step formost people.andP;  Creation activates the drawing tools, which let you work inbezier curves, filleted, enclosed and arrow lines.andM;I was a little disappointed that I could not specify any point size for mylines, but a quite acceptable range, from hairline to 12 points, issupported.andM;DeScribe also imports drawings in several graphics formats, including PM,Lotus, .CGM Paint, .TIF, Windows Metafile, .GEM and AutoCAD's .DXF.andP;  On thetext side, DeScribe supports almost all the word processing packages popularin the federal government.andM;If your office is doing some fence-sitting on the Microsoft Windows vs.andP;  IBMOS/2 issue, DeScribe may be reason enough to topple into Big Blue's yard.andM;DeScribe Inc., Sacramento, Calif., tel.andP;
