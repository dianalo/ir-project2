Experts say the country's ranks of landless peasants remainswollen and may be worse off than they were a decade or two ago.But social and economic changes have dulled their once-fiercethirst for their own acre to till.   The loss of priority is evident in declarations by civilianpoliticians pressing for an end to the 14-year-old militarygovernment of President Augusto Pinochet. No longer do they cry outfor expropriation of large land holdings for distribution among thepoor _ a call that once chilled the blood of wealthy farmers andranchers.   A recent 91-page proposal by six opposition groups for atransitional government to restore democracy contained not a wordon the issue. ``There will be no land reform'' during any suchtransition, Patricio Aylwin, president of the Christian DemocraticParty, told reporters.   ``The young are calling for a well-paid job rather than forland,'' said Emiliano Ortega, a Santiago-based agronomist andsocial scientists. ``They remember the experience of their fathers,who lost their land.''   The issue of land reform began sweeping Latin America in the1950s and 1960. In Chile it reached its peak under the governmentof President Salvador Allende, a Marxist elected in 1970. Hisadminstration expropriated about 16 million acres for distributionamong 60,000 peasant families. Some farms were directly seized byleftist groups.   The upheaval helped trigger a 1973 coup that installed Pinochet,commander of the army and a fierce anti-communist.   Pinochet quickly gave back more than half the expropriated landto its original owners or new farming companies, and tens ofthousands of peasants were booted off their newly acquired plots.Powerful peasant organizations, often aligned with the politicalleft, were dismantled.   A free-market economic program was launched, stressingagricultural exports. To compete in world markets, farmers werepushed to modernize with costly tractors and other machinery,fertilizers and insecticides. Many made the expensive switch fromtraditional crops such as wheat and corn to more profitableproducts, especially fruit.   The result has been an extraordinary agricultural boom, withproduction up by about half overall and annual exports soaring fromabout $20 million in the early 1970s to more than $500 million now.   But the peasants found themselves without a secure role. Theland reform efforts and ensuing modernization destroyed thetraditional ``hacienda'' system, under which peasants worked astenant farmers or farmhands with free housing. In addition, manypeasants who did receive land found competition too costly and soldtheir plots.   Tens of thousands turned to seasonal and migrant labor, workingeight to 16 hours a day for a monthly salary equivalent to lessthan $100, said Solidarity, a church-sponsored magazine on humanrights and issues. ``The peasant became just another laborer.''   Ortega said that as a result of the changes, the peasant of the1980s is more interested in his paycheck and working conditionsthan in being given land he can't afford to cultivate.   ``There's been a very strong cultural change and a strong changein labor relations,'' he said. ``It's not going to be like in thepast.''   ``Before, peasants lived for generations on the land. Now theydon't, they don't live within the farms. Thus, they don't identifythemselves as much with a piece of land.''   Ortega estimated the number of seasonal farm laborers at about300,000 and said they will represent a powerful political force ifgiven the opportunity to organize.</TEXT></DOC>
