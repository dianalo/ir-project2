The publishing and theme park concern, based in Orlando, Fla., said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue 10 million shares of common stock, $200 million in senior notes due 1997 and $200 million in subordinated debentures due 2004.    Under the refinancing plan, the company said it would use proceeds from the bond sales to pay down its approximately $1.3 billion bank debt while using cash from the stock sale, expected to be about $100 million, for working capital. Bank lenders, in turn, agreed to extend the maturity of the remaining debt to 1996 from 1993, to ease the debt amortization requirements, and to modify &quot;certain covenants&quot; of its debt agreements, the concern said.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Harcourt closed Friday at $10.75, down 25 cents.    William Jovanovich, chairman and chief executive officer, hailed the initiative as the final step in the costly recapitalization program undertaken last year to fend off a hostile takeover attempt by British media magnate Robert Maxwell.    &quot;This is a triumph,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;It's the culmination of 17 months of getting us to the place I want us to be, which is public, whole and independent.&quot;    Mr. Jovanovich said he had expected to refinance the bank debt ever since the recapitalization was announced, because the repayment period, six years, was unusually short. He said all of the company's bank lenders, more than 40 in all, agreed to the new plan.    In part, the announcement appeared aimed at silencing speculation that the company might be forced by its debt burden to sell additional assets, such as one or more of its Sea World theme parks or its insurance operations. Indeed, Mr. Jovanovich said the refinancing accord specifically prohibits the sale of additional operating assets.    &quot;I am tired of that speculation, it's absolutely not true,&quot; Mr. Jovanovich said. &quot;I'd like to get out of the news and just publish.&quot; He said sales of real estate assets would still be permitted under the new agreement.    The company said it also is planning to redeem $83.6 million in preferred stock to reduce the nearly 20% annualized dividend burden. Funds for the redemption will come from working capital and from the private placement of a $53.6 million convertible note, with interest of 9 3/4%, a Harcourt adviser said.    Despite the company's optimism, at least one analyst warned that the refinancing merely postpones the day of reckoning for Harcourt's costly attempt to stay independent. The move &quot;means they're in the soup and they have to bring a lot of money down to equity,&quot; contends Ivan Obolensky, a senior vice president at Josephthal andamp; Co. Inc., New York.    &quot;What you've got are cash flows that are extremely strong but that are falling short of principal payments,&quot; said Bert Boksen, a senior analyst at Raymond James Financial Corp., St. Petersburg, Fla. &quot;This is a very good company,&quot; but &quot;it is in a survival mode,&quot; he added.    In the second quarter, Harcourt reported a net loss of $44.6 million, on sharply increased revenue of $318.2 million. </TEXT></DOC>
