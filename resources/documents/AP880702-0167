The inspectors will monitor the Hercules Aerospace Co. missileplant in Magna, Utah, where Pershing II missiles banned under theIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty were produced.   A group of U.S. inspectors arrived in the Soviet Union on Fridayunder the treaty signed by President Reagan and Soviet leaderMikhail Gorbachev in December.   The 22 Soviet missile experts and linguists arrived at the UtahAir National Guard field at the Salt Lake International Airportaboard an Air Force C-141 cargo plane at about 3 p.m.   The Soviet team was part of a contingent of 70 missilespecialists who arrived at Travis Air Force Base in California onFriday night.   The inspectors assigned to the Hercules plant will be the onlypermanently based Soviets, who can stay for up to 13 years underthe terms of the treaty.   Early Sunday, the 48 other inspectors were to leave the air baseto conduct spot checks at as many as five missile sites inCalifornia, Utah, Colorado and Arizona.   A U.S. team, meanwhile, has arrived in the Soviet city ofVotkinsk, the site of a plant that formerly built the SS-20missiles, the most important Soviet weapon to be eliminated underthe treaty.   The Soviets arriving in Utah were greeted by a small group oflocal residents, including about a dozen Magna elementary schoolchildren, who held signs reading ``Welcome to Magna.''   Speaking through an interpreter, Anatoly Samarin, the leader ofthe inspection team, said the time had come to effect the terms ofthe treaty to eliminate Soviet and U.S. intermediate missiles.   ``It is generally accepted that the INF Treaty is an importantstage in the relations between our two countries, a first steptowards the saving of mankind from the threat of nuclearannhilation,'' he said in a brief, prepared statement.   ``We should not be cynical or euphoric aboutthis process,'' saidMarine Col. George Connell of the On-Site Inspection Agency. ``It'snot the millenium, but it is an important step in the peaceprocess.''   The Soviets mingled briefly with the children, shaking hands andpassing out Russian pocket calendars before boarding a bus to theirapartments in suburban Salt Lake City, where they will stay thereuntil quarters are built for them in Magna.   The all-male contingent traveled to the Utah without wives andfamilies. They will be rotatd periodically with other Soviets, butKirk Van Leeuwen, logistics manager for the OSIA, said the schedulewill be up to the Soviets.   The apartment building where the Soviets are staying has beenrestricted and is off-limits to the news media, Van Leeuwen said.``They asked for privacy just to unload,'' he said. ``They`retired.''   The ``baseline inspections'' to be conducted within the next twomonths are designed to verify the exact number of missiles andrelated components to be destroyed under the treaty.   The Soviet inspectors arrived with a 10-member air crew aboardan Aeroflot jetliner at Travis on Friday, the same day 20 Americaninspectors left for Moscow and Votkinsk.   At the Magna plant, which made Pershing missile rocket motors,the Soviets have the right to monitor the plant's gates for up to13 years. The U.S. may station inspectors for the same period at aVotkinsk plant that formerly built the SS-20 missiles, the mostimportant Soviet weapon to be eliminted under the treaty.   The Soviets were scheduled to announce late Saturday which ofthe five sites they will visit to conduct the baseline spot checks.The five are a General Dynamics Corp. plant in San Diego; theArmy's Dugway Proving Ground in western Utah; the Pueblo Army Depotin Pueblo, Colo.; Fort Huachuca, Ariz.; and Davis-Monthan Air ForceBase near Tucson, Ariz.   Altogther, there are 26 missile sites in the U.S. and WesternEurope and 133 sites in the Soviet Union, East Germany andCzechoslovakia that are open to inspection under the treaty.   The INF pact, the first to allow such on-site inspection, isviewed as a trial for the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,which would slash arsenals of long-range superpower nuclear weaponsby 30 percent to 50 percent, and involve much more complicatedverification procedures.</TEXT></DOC>
