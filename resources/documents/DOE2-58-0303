Differences between existing and new policies are explained.In the case of exports and international lines, approval is requiredfrom the National Energy Board; the existing policy requires licensesor certificates and Governor-in-Council approval, whereas the new policyis to require a public hearing and Governor-in-Council approval onlyin designated cases. Authorizations will normally be by permit, not requiringhearings or Governor-in-Council approval. Criteria are outlined to indicatewhen such approval would be necessary. With respect to interprovincialpower lines, the present policy, which does not require National EnergyBoard certification, except in designated cases, is continued. Environmentalpolicy related to electricity production and transmission is not theexclusive responsibility of the federal government, and a coordinatedapproach with the provinces and the electric utilities is necessary fordevelopment of suitable policy.
