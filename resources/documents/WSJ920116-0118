The tangled case of Mr. Doherty, who has been imprisonedin the U.S. for eight years, has provoked political, ethnicand diplomatic clashes. He has been portrayed by someIrish-Americans as a hero mistreated by the U.S. justicesystem; others, especially the British, consider him aterrorist.</LP><TEXT>   The Supreme Court, in a splintered decision, reversed a1990 ruling by the federal appeals court in New York thatformer Attorney General Dick Thornburgh had &quot;abused hisdiscretion&quot; when he refused to reopen deportation proceedingsfor Mr. Doherty.

The Justice Department, which had appealed the case to theSupreme Court, is expected to move quickly to deport Mr.Doherty. A spokeswoman said department officials were&quot;gratified&quot; by the decision but were studying it, looking forany remaining legal obstacles to the deportation.
