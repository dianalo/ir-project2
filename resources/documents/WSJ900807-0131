I supported the idea,they opposed it. Their opposition was based on the simple andstraightforward principle that the state had no businessinvolving itself in this area, which should be left toprivate philanthropy. I argued that it would be good for ourdemocracy if it showed an official interest in educating thetastes and refining the aesthetic sensibilities of itscitizenry.   I won the argument and now wish I hadn't. They were moreright than, at the time, they could know.</LP><TEXT>   In retrospect, I can see that my error derived from thefact that I really had only a superficial understanding ofwhat was happening in the arts world and no understanding ofwhat this portended for the future evolution of what we nowcall &quot;the arts community.&quot; I was raised in a generation thatwas taught to appreciate the virtues of modern art, fromRenoir to Picasso and even to Jackson Pollock and &quot;abstractexpressionism,&quot; though I had to admit that this last stagehad no appeal to me. &quot;Pop art&quot; and &quot;minimalist art&quot; I tendedto dismiss as trendy fads.   But what I was utterly unprepared for was the emergence ofwhat is now called &quot;post-modern art,&quot; which is a politicallycharged art that is utterly contemptuous of the notion ofeducating the tastes and refining the aesthetic sensibilitiesof the citizenry. Its goal, instead, is deliberately tooutrage those tastes and to trash the very idea of an&quot;aesthetic sensibility.&quot;   It is very difficult to convey to people who do not followthe weird goings-on in our culture an appreciation of theanimating agenda of the &quot;arts community&quot; today. An ordinaryAmerican reads about a woman &quot;performing artist&quot; who prancesnude across the stage, with chocolate smeared over her body,and though he may lament the waste of chocolate or nudity, itdoes not occur to him that she is &quot;making a statement,&quot; onethat the &quot;arts community&quot; takes seriously indeed.   Even museum trustees in Washington, D.C., or Cincinnati --an elite, educated, and affluent group of artsphilanthropists -- had no idea what Mapplethorpe was up to inhis photograph of a man with a bullwhip handle inserted intohis rectum. All they knew is that Mapplethorpe was a verytalented photographer (which he was), that no such talentcould ever create an obscene work (which is false) and thatany discriminating judgment on their part was a form ofcensorship that verged on the sacrilegious. Those trusteesare there to raise money and watch the museum's balancesheet. They may or may not know what they like, but theywould never presume to assert what is, or is not, &quot;art.&quot; Toqualify to become a museum trustee these days one must firstsuffer aesthetic castration.   To reach our current condition, it took a century of&quot;permanent revolution&quot; in the arts, made possible,ironically, by a capitalist economy which created affluentart collectors and entrepreneurial art dealers. &quot;Patrons&quot; ofthe arts were replaced by &quot;consumers&quot; of the arts, giving theartist an intoxicating freedom.   It was the artist, now, who told us what was and was not&quot;art&quot; -- not the patron, or the philosopher, or the public.The function of the spectator was to welcome revolutions intaste by permitting himself to be intimidated andindoctrinated by the &quot;arts community,&quot; consisting of artiststhemselves but also and especially (since artists are notusually articulate) art critics, art professors, art dealers,museum directors, etc. The most important spectators who wereso intimidated and indoctrinated were the media, which nowautomatically approach anything declared to be &quot;art&quot; by the&quot;arts community&quot; with the kind of deference, evenpseudo-piety, once reserved for the sphere of religion.   As with most revolutions, some impressive creativeenergies were released, some enduring accomplishments wereachieved. But, again as with most revolutions, the longer itlasted the more the destructive impulse began to dominateover the creative. Yesteryear's creative contributions were,after all, what the latest revolutionary phase had to subvertand overthrow.   After World War II, it became ever more difficult todistinguish artists from publicity-hungry pseudo-artists,from people &quot;making statements&quot; of one kind or other, such&quot;statements&quot; being the essence of pop art, minimalist art,environmental art, and now post-modern art. That practicallyall of this activity was infused by an anti-bourgeois ethoswas unsurprising, since it was simply mirroring the literaryand academic culture in this respect. The bourgeois way ofcoping with this situation was to purchase and &quot;consume&quot; thisart as a commodity, to inventory it and then at some point toexpel it from its system into an underground sump, usuallylocated in the basement of museums. Cooptation, notcensorship, was the strategy.   But this strategy does not work with the last and, onesuspects, final phase of the revolution we are nowwitnessing. Today, the destructive element has almostcompletely overwhelmed the creative. What the &quot;artscommunity&quot; is engaged in is a politics of radical nihilism;it has little interest in, and will openly express contemptfor, &quot;art&quot; in any traditional sense of the term. It is noexaggeration to say that the self-destruction of &quot;art&quot; is akey point in its agenda, accompanied by the &quot;deconstruction,&quot;not only of bourgeois society, but of Western civilizationitself.   &quot;Deconstruction&quot; is an intellectual-ideological movementthat is enormously popular in the humanities departments ofour universities, which seek to free themselves from the&quot;hegemony&quot; of Dead White Males (DWMs is the common reference)such as Shakespeare or Dante so as to justify offering auniversity course on, say, the TV program &quot;The Simpsons.&quot;There are no standards of excellence other than those weimprovise for ourselves, which is why members of the &quot;artscommunity&quot; can solemnly believe and assert that whatever theydo is &quot;art.&quot; The public has the right -- nay, the obligation-- to support it, but not to question it.   What they do, in fact, is powerfully shaped by certainradical ideological currents; radical feminism, homosexualand lesbian self-celebration and black racism are among them.This explains why, though it is &quot;de rigeur&quot; to insult publicfigures, no one in the &quot;arts community&quot; would ever dareinsult the Rev. Louis Farrakhan. Any such painting wouldpromptly be vandalized, to the applause of an &quot;artscommunity&quot; opposed to censorship. It also explains why thereis so little pornography, in the traditional sense, inpost-modern art. Such pornography evokes lust forheterosexual engagement, which post-modern art disapproves ofsince it is thought to debase women. Only homosexual andlesbian sex are allowed to be celebrated.   But if pornography is limited to the homosexual sphere,obscenity is unlimited. The purpose of such obscenity is toderide the Judaeo-Christian-humanist idea of &quot;human dignity&quot;that Western civilization has fostered. If Westerncivilization is itself an obscene heritage of racism, sexismand &quot;elitist&quot; oppression, obscenity is obviously anappropriate response.   Where will it all end? One does have the sense that we arewitnessing either a final convulsion in the history of modernart (and of modern culture) or, perhaps, a final convulsionin Western civilization itself. Most of us would incline tocredit the first alternative. But where does that leave theNational Endowment for the Arts, founded in a different timeand on quite different assumptions about the role of the artsin American life?   The most obvious response would be to abolish the NEA --perhaps over a period of a few years to mitigate thefinancial shock. This is not going to happen, however. Afterall, many major institutions -- symphony orchestras, forinstance, and large museums -- have inevitably becomedependent on NEA grants. The trustees of these institutionshave considerable influence with members of Congress, who aremuch happier opening funding spigots than closing them. Andthe media, it goes without saying, would be horrified at suchan effort at &quot;censorship,&quot; now redefined to include theabsence of government funding.   A more limited response would be to move the NEA away frominvolvement with the most active and turbulent sectors of the&quot;arts community&quot; by requiring that it make only grants ofmore than $50,000 or $100,000. The institutions receivingthis money will be held responsible for any re-grants theymake.   Most of the controversial grants one hears of aresmall-to-modest. But they do serve an important role inlegitimating the activity that is being funded. With $10,000from the NEA, an &quot;experimental workshop in the arts&quot; canapproach foundations and corporations with a plausible claimto respectability. That is precisely why they will fighttooth and nail for the continuation of the small-grantsprogram -- grants made by other members of the &quot;artscommunity,&quot; their &quot;peer groups,&quot; to their friends and allies.Just how Congress will respond to such a reform, now beingbruited, remains to be seen.   But one interesting and important fact has already becomeclear: Our politics today is so spiritually empty, so morallyincoherent, that -- except for a few brave souls -- liberalshave been quick to dismiss as &quot;yahoos&quot; anyone who dares toconfront this assault on the foundations of liberalism andconservatism alike. A great many conservatives, for theirpart, having long ago been ideologically disarmed, are moreembarrassed than interested at having to cope with this issueat all. Something is definitely rotten in the vital areas ofour body politic.   ---   Mr. Kristol, an American Enterprise Institute fellow,co-edits the Public Interest and publishes the NationalInterest.</TEXT></DOC>
