Davison wasformerly ``Doctor Who'' and appeared in ``All Creatures Great andSmall.''   ``People think he doesn't take things seriously or doesn'tunderstand what's going on. It's really a device to keep suspectsoff guard. He wears little, round, horn rim glasses. We've decidedthose probably aren't real and are just part of the image, too.''   The series is adapted from the books by British crime writerMargery Allingham, a peer of Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers.   The new ``Mystery!'' season opens Thursday with ``Campion'' andthe introduction of Diana Rigg as host in place of departingVincent Price.   Campion is, himself, a bit of a mystery.   ``He's a slightly enigmatic figure and it's not made clear inthe books what he's really about,'' said Davison. ``He's theyoungest son of a duke who's gone off to seek adventure. In the1930s it was the practice to send the youngest son off to thecolonies. But he didn't want to do that and set himself up as aprivate detective.   ``His right-hand man is a big, baldheaded ex-convict namedMagersfontein Lugg. He's given up his criminal activities but he'sa source of priceless information for Campion. Albert Campion's nothis real name. Someone calls him Christopher Twelvetrees andsomeone else calls him Orlando. He's obviously a gentleman and wellmannered and is equally at home with the aristocracy or criminalsand gypsies.''   There are four ``Campion'' stories, each told in two weeklyepisodes. Brian Glover is Lugg and Andrew Burt is InspectorStanislaus Oates of Scotland Yard.   British critics have said the major strength of the ``Campion''books were the outrageous plots and their many twists. The openingstory of ``The Case of the Late Pig,'' is about how Campioninvestigates the murder of a friend, months after attending thefriend's funeral. The pig's death turns out to be a clue.   Davison said Allingham wrote some of the books as cerebralexercises and some as ripping yarns, so there will be a mixture inthe series. She also peopled her books with a lot of Americans, butsome of have been taken out. A main character in the first show waschanged from American to a Scot.   Most of the stories take place in England, although one is seton a cruise ship. An opening scene in the French Riviera in oneshow was changed to avoid a costly trip to France to film just onescene.   Davison grew up in South London and began acting in anafter-school drama club. ``I thought I'd have a go at it,'' hesaid. ``I never did well academically. It was always a last-minutescramble to put things together. So I went to drama school insteadof university. I worked in a dry cleaners and a factory and was ahospital orderly before starting school.''   Davison, married about 10 years to American actress SandraDickinson, has an apartment in Los Angeles. They met at the CentralSchool of Speech and Drama, where both attended.   ``I don't think we ever said a word to each other in school,''he said. ``I was aware of her but we were in different years. Thenwe did a rock musical version of `A Midsummer Night's Dream' at theEdinburgh Festival. Sandra has become quite well known in England.''   Davison said he never trained for a second career in case actingdidn't work out.   ``A lot of actors are trained in something else,'' he said.``The temptation is to take another job when things turn bad. WhenI had a bad period I had nothing else to turn to. I spent threeyears in repertory theater, then I decided I should go intotelevision. I didn't work for a year.''   His first major role was in ``Love for Lydia,'' which playedhere on Masterpiece Theatre. He was Tristram, one of two brothers,in the series ``All Creatures Great and Small,'' which was based onJames Herriot's stories about his life as a veterinarian inYorkshire.   He followed Tom Baker as ``Doctor Who,'' a somewhat strangescience fiction fantasy that has a large cult following worldwide.He was the fifth actor in the role, playing it from 1981-84.
