Stocks fell victim to a plunging dollar, lower bond prices and Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole's comments about the possibility of changing the federal tax code to curb leveraged buy-outs, which have figured prominently in the market's recent strength.    Traders also attributed the decline to concern that Mr. Bush could have difficulty working with Congress, which remained under Democratic control, in dealing with the nation's trade and budget deficits.    Although the market was able to rebound from an early downturn, which was due in part to a round of futures-related selling, the recovery attempt ended at midday, with stocks retreating to their session lows.    Prices fell back to those levels again at midafternoon after firming slightly, but then rebounded late in the session in response to a similar move in the bond market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session with a loss of 9.25 to 2118.24 after being down as much as 21 points.    Broader market averages fared worse. The Dow Jones Equity Market Index dropped 1.48 to 257.13; the 0.6% loss compares with a 0.4% drop in the Dow Jones industrials. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index slid 1.82 to 273.33 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 0.92 to 153.92. In addition, 949 issues declined in price on the Big Board, while only 493 advanced.    Trading remained fairly subdued as investors assessed the impact of the election. About 153,140,000 shares changed hands on the Big Board, up from 141,660,000 Tuesday.    Mr. Dole's statement that it might be advisable to change the deductibility of interest payments for loans used to finance buy-outs resurrected an issue that was believed to have been an important factor behind the market's October 1987 crash.    &quot;You've got to pay attention to that kind of talk, whether it's just a little bit of jawboning . . . or they're going to put some meaningful legislation together,&quot; said Thomas R. Walsh, head of equity trading at Nikko Securities International.    Guy Courtney, a senior vice president at David A. Noyes andamp; Co., Chicago, said he believes financing constraints are likely to bring the current wave of buy-outs and takeovers to a halt well before any legislative action can be taken. &quot;We're hitting the end of the cycle because we're running out of money,&quot; he added.    Mr. Courtney also cites recent gains in stocks rumored to be acquisition candidates as evidence of excessive speculation in the market, which in turn suggests that further weakness is to be expected soon. He said takeover activity is &quot;the only thing that's been holding the market up here lately.&quot;    Frederic H. Dickson, senior portfolio manager at Management Asset Corp., Westport, Conn., agreed with that assessment. &quot;We've been taking profits and we're not eager in any way, shape or form to put money to work here,&quot; he said.    The market had enjoyed a &quot;Bush honeymoon&quot; in the weeks before the election, Mr. Dickson said, and must now face the prospect of slower growth in corporate profits, in addition to a drop in takeover activity. &quot;The excitement of the election is over, the honeymoon is over, and economic reality has set back in.&quot;    There are also doubts about whether Mr. Bush will prove capable of working with Congress to attack the deficit problem. &quot;I don't think he can,&quot; said Scott Gledhill, a vice president at Harbor Capital Management, Boston.    Georgia Gulf plunged 2 1/2 to 70 5/8 and Vista Chemical fell 1 1/2 to 47 1/4. Some analysts say there is a current oversupply of polyvinyl chloride pipe that could spread to other ethylene-based products, reducing demand for the companies' chemicals.    Gap Inc. jumped 1 7/8 to 38, a 52-week high, apparently because of anticipation of a strong third-quarter earnings report from the company today. Another specialty retailer, Limited Inc., reported better-than-expected results for the quarter earlier this week.    Interco fell 1 1/4 to 68. The company said a federal court agreed to hear its motion for a preliminary injuction against the $74-a-share takeover offer from a group headed by the Rales brothers of Washington, D.C. Interco claims the bid violates federal margin regulations.    Grumman slid 1 to 21 3/8. Merrill Lynch lowered its investment rating on the stock and cut its estimates of the company's 1988 and 1989 earnings after Grumman's third-quarter earnings fell short of expectations.    Novo Industri, which reported that its third-quarter earnings were 18% higher than a year ago, jumped 2 1/8 to 40 7/8. The company said the results confirm its expectations that earnings for the year will show a &quot;major&quot; increase from last year.    General Signal lost 1 1/4 to 45 in what a company official said was the heaviest trading day in its history. More than 767,000 shares changed hands in Big Board composite trading, and the company said it appeared that one major seller was largely responsible for the activity.    Harnischfeger went down 1 to 15 1/4 in active trading. Wertheim Schroder removed the stock from its list of recommended issues.    EGandamp;G lost 1 1/8 to 28 7/8 in trading that included a single block of 537,100 shares, or 2% of its shares outstanding; the firm couldn't explain the activity.    Century Telephone Enterprises, one of 12 cellular telephone companies on which Moran andamp; Associates repeated purchase recommendations, rose 7/8 to 27 7/8. Others recommended by the Greenwich, Conn.-based firm include two issues on the American Stock Exchange: U.S. Cellular, which added 1 1/8 to 18 5/8, and Telephone andamp; Data Systems, which rose 1 5/8 to 34 1/4.    The American Stock Exchange index slipped 0.72 to 294.04. Volume totaled 8,250,000 shares.    Chase Medical Group fell 1/2 to 6 3/4. The company said it expects to report a loss for its fiscal second quarter as the result of a write-down of receivables.    Synalloy Corp. surged 5/8 to 5 3/4 after rejecting as inadequate a $6.50-a-share bid from SYO Holdings. The company also authorized the buy-back of 200,000 shares. </TEXT></DOC>
