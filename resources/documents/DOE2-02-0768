<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-02-0768 </DOCNO><TEXT>A fail safe valve is described comprising a body having a flowway therethroughand a closure member movable between positions opening and closing theflowway. There is an actuator having a stem including one portion connectedto the closure member and mounted for reciprocation in opposite directionsto move the closure member between the positions. The piston means areresponsive to the supply of a control fluid for urging the one stem portionin one direction to move the closure member to one position and maintainit in that position as long as the control fluid is maintained at a predeterminedpressure level. Means for yieldably urge the one stem portion in theother direction to move the closure member to its other position in theevent the control fluid is not so maintained. Operating means mountedon the actuator and manipulatable from the exterior move another portionof the stem in the one direction to move the closure member to its oneposition. Means are provided for automatically responding to the failureof a predetermined environmental temperature condition for renderingthe operating means inoperative to move the other portion of the stemin the one direction upon reestablishment of the control fluid to thepiston means at the predetermined pressure level.</TEXT></DOC>
