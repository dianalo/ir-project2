They also update the entire subpart to reflect policies andstatutory amendments which are in effect but are not in current regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>State and local government employees are exempt from mandatory coverageunder Social Security. Section 218 of the Act requires that the Secretaryof Health and Human Services (the Secretary), when requested by a State,shall enter into an agreement to provide retirement, survivors, disability,and hospital insurance coverage of the services of employees of a Stateor its political subdivisions. If an interstate instrumentality (whichto the extent practicable is treated as a State) makes the request, theSecretary may enter into such an agreement. By this agreement Social Securityprotection is provided for the groups of employees the State brings underthe agreement. State and local government employees covered under an agreementhave the same benefit rights and responsibilities as other employees whohave Social Security coverage. The amount of the payments made by the Statefor Social Security protection of State and local employees is the sameas is paid by private sector employers and employees who are mandatorilycovered by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, 26 U.S.C. 3101 <T3>et seq. </T3>For payments due on wages paid before January 1, 1987,the State assumed full financial and reporting responsibility for the coverageprovided under its agreement. The agreement may not be terminated in itsentirety or with respect to any coverage group under that agreement. All States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have agreements with theSecretary. Currently these agreements provide coverage to approximately10 million employees. <ITAG tagnum="84">Delayed Effective Date </ITAG>Section 7 of Pub. L. 94-202 (42 U.S.C. 405a) requires that any regulationor modification of a regulation which pertains, directly or indirectly,to the frequency or due dates for payments and reports required under section218(e) of the Act as it read prior to the enactment of Pub. L. 99-509 notbecome effective until 18 months after it is published as a final rulein the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Section 404.1249 affects those due dates andis discussed under ``Major Changes.'' However, only andSection; 404.1249(b)(2)(ii)is subject to the 18-month delayed effective date. Most of the rules inthe section are already in effect and the more frequent deposit of contributionsis mandated by section 342 of Pub. L. 98-21 for calendar months beginningafter December 1983. <ITAG tagnum="84">Considerations in Preparing This Comprehensive Revision </ITAG>Most of the current regulations governing the coverage of employees ofState and local governments were written in the 1950's and early 1960's.Some of the current rules have not been changed since they were originallypublished in May 1955. In preparing this comprehensive revision, we notonly looked at the structure of the subpart and the language used in thecurrent sections, but also evaluated the policies and procedures. <ITAG tagnum="85">Comments Received Following Publication of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.</ITAG>In order to obtain the public's views and comments before proceeding withthese amendments, we published an NPRM in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on May 29, 1986 at 51 FR 19468. The public wasinvited to submit comments pertaining to the proposed amendments withina period of 120 days from the date of the publication of the notice. Thecomment period closed on September 26, 1986. We received comments fromsix States. Each State commented on one or more provisions of the regulations.For ease of comprehension, we have condensed, summarized or paraphrasedthe comments and have grouped them according to the subject and issuesraised. We have tried, to the extent possible, to present the commentsand our response in the order in which the regulations are organized. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two comments were made that the requirement in andSection;404.1226 that the State or political subdivision furnish a terminated employeewith a Form W-2 or statement on the day on which wages are last paid tothe employee is not needed because the requirement is not consistent withFederal income tax requirements and as a result is confusing. <T3>Response: </T3>We are adopting this comment. Section 404.1226 is removedto reflect this change in the final regulations. Pub. L. 99-509 transfersresponsibility for collecting contributions and receiving wage reportsfrom the States to IRS for wages paid in 1987 and years later. Therefore,these requirements are within the purview of IRS rather than SSA. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two comments were made that the subpoena provision isnot needed because there has historically been good cooperation and thereare already in place adequate means for securing records and information.<T3>Response: </T3>We are not adopting this comment. We agree that therehas been good cooperation. However, section 205(d) of the Act authorizesour use of the subpoena, and retaining the subpoena provision in the finalregulations appropriately reflects SSA's authority to use a subpoena inthe event that it would, at sometime in the future, be necessary to doso. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters suggest that andSection; 404.1243(c) shouldhave a cross-reference to the IRS magnetic media requirements. <T3>Response: </T3>We are not adopting this comment. IRS frequently revisesthe magnetic media requirements. During these revisions, the name and publicationnumber may change resulting in an incorrect reference in the regulations.We believe a specific request to IRS for the magnetic media requirementswill be more effective than to request the information by the incorrectname or publication number. <T3>Comment: </T3>There were several comments that electronic fund transferwould be costly to the States and deprive the States of interest from thetime the deposits were made until the deposits were actually credited.<T3>Response: </T3>We are adopting this comment. The first sentence andthe parenthetical sentence at the beginning of andSection; 404.1262 are removed.The removal of these two sentences restores the manner of payment requirementsto what they were before this revision of regulations. At the time theNPRM that proposed requiring electronic transfer of funds was published,SSA was responsible for collection of contributions from the States amountingto over $4 billion per year. The potential for greater savings and efficiencyby requiring electronic transfer of funds was extraordinarily high. However,with the passage of section 9002 of Pub. L. 99-509, the responsibilityfor collection of contributions was transferred to IRS for payments dueon wages paid in 1987 and years later. As a result of this change in responsbility,deposits by the States (including Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, andinterstate instrumentalities) to SSA now average less than $10,000 permonth each. Most of this amount is from adjustments and underpayments subjectto other provisions of the regulations rather than payments made in connectionwith filed wage reports. The savings previously estimated by requiringelectronic transfer of funds are now significantly overstated. For thesereasons, we are not requiring electronic transfer of funds in these finalregulations, but continue to make it available to those remaining Stateswho have not elected to use it. <T3>Comment: </T3>There were several comments that the regulations provisionsfor interest payments on adjustment reports at andSection; 404.1265 woulddiscourage States from filing adjustment reports to make corrections andthat these provisions should be reconsidered. (Two comments offered alternativeproposals to be considered.) <T3>Response: </T3>We are adopting the comments that we should reconsiderthe regulations provisions for interest payments on adjustment reports.While we are reconsidering this policy, we will continue to use the rulesthat are currently in effect. We moved the modified version of the textregarding interest payments from the former andSection; 404.1261 (a) and(b) to andSection; 404.1265 (b) and (c) replacing andSection; 404.1265 (a)(2)and (b) shown in the NPRM. Section 404.1265(b) is renumbered as andSection;404.1265(d). Section 404.1265(d) is renumbered as andSection; 404.1265(e).We also made editorial changes to the former paragraphs that are retainedto correct the reference in andSection; 404.1265(b)(1) to read andSection;404.1249, to remove the references in andSection; 404.1265(c) to the numberedforms because these forms are obsolete, to continue the use of the IRSabbreviation for the Internal Revenue Service, and to remove the parentheticalsentence at the end of the paragraph because the reference is no longerappropriate. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggests that the andSection; 404.1291 proposedreconsideration by an appropriate SSA official that is to precede the reviewby the Secretary or someone delegated by the Secretary is an unnecessarystep in the review process and should be eliminated. <T3>Response: </T3>We are not adopting this suggestion. Our experienceindicates that the reconsideration process is a cost efficient method ofresolving many disagreements. Further, States requested that the reconsiderationstep be included during a Federal/State meeting about the review process.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters suggest that since States have only 90days to request review, SSA should have a similar 90 days to issue theCommissioner's decision.<T3>Response: </T3>We are not adopting this comment. The requirement thatthe State file a request for review does not equate to the requirementsfor our review of the evidence, the conducting of an audit if necessary,and the preparation of a determination. Although it may appear that thereview process is lengthy, this conclusion does not recognize that theremay be complex issues under review. <ITAG tagnum="84">Changes to Take Account of Legislation Impacting on the NPRM </ITAG>Section 12110 of Pub. L. 99-272 (enacted April 7, 1986) amends sections218(f)(1) and 218(u)(3) of the Act by providing that the effective dateof an agreement or modification is based on the date of mailing or deliveryby other means to the Secretary. These amendments to the Act apply to agreementsor modifications mailed or delivered to the Secretary on or after April7, 1986. Sections 404.1214(e) and 404.1215(d) of these regulations areamended to include this new provision of the Act. Section 9002 of Pub. L. 99-509 (enacted October 21, 1986) amends section218 of the Act and Subchapter C of Chapter 21 of the Internal Revenue Codeof 1954 by removing the States' fiscal liability for their political subdivisions'Social Security contributions and requiring States and political subdivisionsto pay Federal Insurance Contribution Act taxes in the same manner thatprivate employers do. Administration and collection of these taxes is transferredfrom SSA to IRS. The amendments are effective for payments due on wagespaid in 1987 and later years. For payments due on wages paid prior to 1987,regulations in Subpart M continue to apply. To assist in referencing, we indicated all sections in subpart M that arewholly or partially affected by the amendment of section 218 of the Actby Pub. L. 99-509. Each section title is appended with the phrase ``_forwages paid prior to 1987'' to show the limited applicability of that sectionin regard to contribution liability. Although the appended phrase may appearinappropriate for certain section titles, the appended phrase is appropriatein the context of the contribution liability. Several sections are reorderedto emphasize the limited applicability, but the text remains unchanged.In andSection; 404.1200, we explain the use of the phrase ``For wages paidprior to 1987._'' to make clear the financial and reporting responsibilityof the States. Also, in andSection; 404.1242(b) last sentence, we added thephrase ``For backpay awards paid prior to 1987,_'' to show the responsibilityextends to backpay awards. Upon resolution of payment, reporting, and adjustment issues for yearsprior to 1987, we plan to remove sections or paragraphs designated ``_forwages paid prior to 1987.'' Section 404.1249(b)(2)(i) is rewritten to show that for agreements or modificationsproviding coverage of employees for periods prior to 1987, States shallpay contributions due and shall file wage reports with SSA for these periods.The payments and wage reports are due within 90 days after the date ofthe notice that the Secretary has signed the agreement or modification.Section 9002 of Pub. L. 99-509 provides that Subchapter C of Chapter 21of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 applies to wages paid in 1987 andlater years. In addition to the major changes required by statute, we made editorialchanges to make the regulations clear and to provide for ease of crossreference. These changes include: (1) Adding the phrase ``, the period involved,'' to the definitions of``allowance of a credit or refund'' and to the definition of ``assessment''in andSection; 404.1202 because we routinely provide this information inthese notices; (2) Adding a cross-reference to the Act in andSection; 404.1206(c)(3); (3) Updating the reference at andSection;andSection; 404.1207(a) and 404.1214(c)(1)from section 218(k) of the Act to section 218(g) as provided by section9002 of Pub. L. 99-509; (4) Moving the second parenthetical at the end of the sentence, ``(the``no'' group)'' in andSection; 404.1207(b) to a location next to the groupreferred to and in the next sentence adding the phrase ``for groups coveredafter 1959'' for clarity; (5) Adding the exclusion at andSection; 404.1210(e)(1) that was in effectprior to the enactment of section 353 of Pub. L. 95-216 because this exclusionis contained in and still applies to some State agreements; (6) Removing the reference in the second sentence of andSection; 404.1220(b)to filing a return with the State by removing the phrase ``with the State'';(7) Substituting the word ``employer'' for ``State'' in andSection; 404.1220(e);(8) Removing andSection;andSection; 404.1221, 404.1223, and 404.1226 becausethe enactment of section 9002 of Pub. L. 99-509 makes reporting requirementsthe responsibility of IRS for wages paid in 1987 and years after;(9) Substituting the word ``employer'' for ``State'' each place it appearsin the text of andSection; 404.1223; (10) Removing andSection; 404.1275 (b) and (c) because adjustment made onpersonal income tax returns is within the purview of IRS; and (11) Rewriting andSection; 404.1283(b) to conform to section 205(c)(5) ofthe Act to show our authority to ``delete'' wage entries from the earningsrecord rather than to ``revise.'' <ITAG tagnum="85">Changes To Take Account of Final Rule Published May 9, 1986, But NotIncluded in the NPRM Published May 29, 1986 </ITAG>On May 9, 1986, we published a final rule at 51 FR 17173. This final ruleamended 20 CFR 404.1281(a) and 404.1286(a). At this time, we are incorporatingthat final rule into this final rule. The text is unchanged. However, sincethe revised andSection;andSection; 404.1281 and 404.1286 deal with differentsubjects, we are incorporating the text of these sections of the finalrule into the proper sections of the revision which are andSection;andSection;404.1287(a) and 404.1283(a) respectively. Except for the changes in response to comments, statutory changes, theinclusion of the final rule that amended current andSection;andSection; 404.1287(a)and 404.1283(a), and minor editorial changes, we are adopting the rulesas proposed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Changes </ITAG>Definitions Section 404.1202. We have added a new section which contains definitions of terms which havespecial meanings as used throughout this subpart. Evidence  Section 404.1203. Section 404.1203 is a new section which describes in general terms ourrules about requesting evidence from a State of wages paid to employeesand contributions due on those wages. We discuss in this section what wedo when we need evidence, the State's responsibility for supplying accuratewage information and any evidence needed to verify the accuracy of reportsrelated to those wages, and what happens if a State does not submit therequested evidence. Authorized State Officials Section 404.1204. This is a new section which requires that a State designate the officialauthorized to act on its behalf, and that it inform SSA of any change inofficials or his or her authority. What Groups of Employees May Be Covered Sections 404.1205-404.1212. This is a new group of sections which discuss in general terms what groupsof employees may be covered, other groupings of employees and the serviceswhich may or may not be covered. We have also included a description ofthe referendum procedures States must follow in providing coverage to certaingroups of employees. These referendum procedures reflect the requirementsin sections 218(d) (3) and (7) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 418(d) (3) and (7)).There are a number of special provisions in the Act which relate to specificStates. These provisions establish procedures for a State to provide coveragefor employees in specified positions. For example, section 218(d)(6)(G)of the Act (42 U.S.C. 418(d)(6)(G)) gives several States the option ofproviding coverage for employees in positions under a retirement systemwhere these States are paid from Federal grants for administering unemploymentcompensation. Since these various provisions have limited applicabilityand are rarely used, we have not included them in these regulations. How Coverage is Obtained and Continues Sections 404.1214-404.1219. These are new sections which generally reflect the procedures for establishingand continuing coverage under an agreement. In andSection; 404.1214(d) we set out what provisions an agreement must include.Section 404.1215(b) indicates that when an agreement is modified, the Statemay specify a controlling date for determining retroactive coverage foremployees. That controlling date can be no earlier than the date the modificationis mailed or otherwise delivered to the Secretary. Section 404.1216 describes how an agreement may be modified to correctvarious errors. Section 404.1217 explains that coverage under an agreement continues indefinitely.Sections 404.1218 and 404.1219 reflect the provisions of section 103 ofPub. L. 98-21, enacted April 20, 1983. Section 103 provides that no agreementmay be terminated, either in its entirety or with respect to any coveragegroup, on or after April 20, 1983. Section 103 applies without regard towhether a notice of intent to terminate was filed before Pub. L. 98-21was enacted. Section 103 also repealed the prohibition in former section218(g)(3) of the Act against resumption of coverage. Coverage previouslyterminated may be resumed by a modification to the State's agreement. How to Identify Employees Who Are Covered Section 404.1220. Section 404.1220 describes how we assign identification numbers to theState and its political subdivisions, coverage groups, etc., covered bya State's agreement.What Records of Coverage Must Be Kept Section 404.1225. Section 404.1225 describes what records of an employee's remuneration aState or its political subdivisions must keep, where they are to be maintained,and for how long. Review of Compliance by State With Its Agreement Sections 404.1230 through404.1234. These regulations provide for onsite review of all pertinent source recordsmaintained by the State or its political subdivisions. This will enableus to evaluate the records from which wage reports and contribution returnswere prepared and how those records were compiled, processed, and maintained.These reviews may include discussions with the employee(s) working withthose records. They would be conducted in cooperation with the State SocialSecurity Administrator. How to Report Wages and Contributions Sections 404.1237 through 404.1251.Section 404.1237 contains the basic rule that a State must report eachyear, by coverage group, the wages paid each covered employee during thatyear. Section 404.1239 permits a State to combine the wages of an employee whoperforms covered services for more than one coverage group up to the annualwage limitation and pay Social Security contributions on that amount. Otherwise,the wages reported for an employee by all of the coverage groups mightexceed the annual wage limitation. And the State, by paying Social Securitycontributions on the wages reported separately by each coverage group,would pay more than the maximum amount of Social Security contributionsrequired each year. Section 404.1242 is a new section which describes ``back pay'' to an employeeand how it must be reported. Section 404.1243 describes what means a State may use to make reports,e.g., forms, magnetic tape, etc. Section 404.1247 requires that a Stateshall report wages for the calendar year in which they were paid. Section 404.1249 is the current andSection; 404.1255a. Paragraph (a)(2) ofthis section contains the twice a month ``frequency of deposit'' rule mandatedby section 342 of Pub. L. 98-21, the Social Security Amendments of 1983.Paragraph (b)(2) contains the due dates for filing contribution returnsand wage reports and also the ``annual reporting'' rules. Paragraphs (b)(2)(i)and (b)(2)(iii) are virtually identical to current andSection; 404.1255a(c)(2)(i) and (iii). Paragraph (b)(2)(ii) is subject to the 18 month delay inits effective date to comply with section 7 of Pub. L. 94-202 (42 U.S.C.405a). Paragraph (c) on payments by a third party on account of sicknessor accident disability is virtually identical to current andSection; 404.1255a(a)(2)which we published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>as a final rule on September 30, 1983, at 48FR 44771. We propose to delay the effective date of only paragraph (b)(2)(ii)for 18 months after it is published as a final rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. This delay would in no way affect the currentrules that are merely incorporated in the new section, since they are alreadyin effect. The delay would also in no way delay the effect of the ``frequencyof deposit'' requirement since the requirement is mandated by statute.What is a State's Liability for Contributions Section 404.1255 and 404.1256.Section 404.1255 describes the amount of Social Security contributionsa State is liable for and when that liability begins. Section 404.1256describes the conditions under which a State's liability for contributionsmay be limited when an employee performs services in one or more coveragegroups. Figuring the Amount of the State's Contributions Sections 404.1260 through404.1263. These sections describe how a State's contributions are computed and whenand how they must be paid. If a State Fails To Make Timely Payments Sections 404.1265 through 404.1267.Section 404.1265 sets out when and how adjustment of underpayments of contributionsare made if a State fails to pay timely its contributions when due underandSection; 404.1249. Section 404.1267, which accords with section 218(j) of the Act as it readprior to the enactment of Pub. L. 99-509, authorizes the Secretary to offsetthe Social Security contributions a State has not paid against amountsdue a State under another provision of the Social Security Act.How to Adjust Errors in Reports and Contributions Sections 404.1270 through404.1276. Sections 404.1271, 404.1272, and 404.1275 describe how we handle paymentsmade by a State which exceed the amount of contributions for which it isliable. Section 404.1276 explains how we handle situations where employees' wageshave been erroneously reported and Social Security contributions have beenerroneously paid to the Internal Revenue Service. How Overpayments of Contributions Are Credited or Refunded Sections 404.1280through 404.1284. When a State pays more than the required amount of Social Security contributions,the State may timely request that we credit or refund the overpaid amount.Section 404.1284 allows the Secretary, in limited situations, to offsetan underpayment of contributions against an overpayment. In andSection; 404.1284(b)we indicate the State will be given an opportunity to pay the contributionsdue before those amounts are offset against any credit which is due theState. How Assessments For Underpayments of Contributions Are Made Sections 404.1285through 404.1289. Section 404.1285 provides that a State is liable for an amount due underan agreement until the Secretary is satisfied the State has paid that amount.If the Secretary is not satisfied that a State has paid the correct amount,the Secretary issues an assessment for the outstanding amount. Section 404.1286 sets out the time limits within which the Secretary mustissue an assessment for an amount due. Section 404.1287 sets out exceptionsto the time limits within which the Secretary must issue an assessment.Section 404.1289 points out when we may accept a wage report which a Statesubmits after the time periods described in andSection; 404.1286 expire.Secretary's Review of Decisions on Credits, Refunds, or Assessments Sections404.1290 through 404.1296. These sections revise current andSection;andSection; 404.1270-404.1274 andalso include new sections to provide for review of appealed administrativedecisions. How a State May Seek Court Review of Secretary's Decision Sections 404.1297through 404.1299.

Therefore, a regulatory impact analysis is not required.Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 These final rules contain information collection and recordkeeping requirementsin the following sections: 404.1203, 404.1204(a)(5) and (b), 404.1214(d),404.1216(a), 404.1220, 404.1225, 404.1237, 404.1239, 404.1242, 404.1243,404.1247, 404.1249, 404.1251, 404.1265, 404.1271, and 404.1272. As requiredby section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, we will submita copy of these rules to OMB for its review of these information collectionrequirements. Other organizations and individuals desiring to submit commentson the information collection requirements should direct them to the agencyofficial designated for this purpose whose name appears in this preambleand to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, New ExecutiveOffice Building, Room 3002, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officerfor HHS. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services certifiesthat these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities, including small governmental jurisdictions.Under the terms of the agreement under section 218 of the Act, a Stateobtains coverage for governmental entities requesting Social Security coverage.Entities which obtain coverage are now responsible for paying the contributionsand filing the reports necessary to provide Social Security coverage forthe services of its employees. Some of the regulations describe the economic consequences when these responsibilitiesare not met. However, we expect those measures will impact on a limitednumber of small entities and will not have a significant economic impacton those entities. Any economic impact involved in the regulations reflectingsections 103 and 342 of Pub. L. 98-21, section 12110 of Pub. L. 99-272,and section 9002 of Pub. L. 99-509 result directly from the statutory amendments,not from the regulations. Therefore, we believe that a regulatory analysis under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct is not required.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs Nos. 13.802-13.814,Social Security Programs.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 20 CFR Part 404 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure; Death benefits, Disabled, Old-Age,Survivors, and Disability Insurance, Social Security Administration.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 20, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Dorcas R.

For purposes of obtainingcoverage, a system may be considered a separate retirement system authorizedby section 218(d)(6) (A) or (B) of the Act. Under this section of the Acta State may designate the positions of any one of the following groupingsof employees as a separate retirement system: (1) The entire system; (2) The employees of the State under the system; (3) The employees of each political subdivision in the State under thesystem; (4) The employees of the State and the employees of any one or more ofthe State's political subdivisions; (5) The employees of any combination of the State's political subdivisions;(6) The employees of each institution of higher learning, including juniorcolleges and teachers colleges; or (7) The employees of a hospital which is an integral part of a politicalsubdivision.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">If State law requires a State or political subdivision to have a retirementsystem, it is considered established even though no action has been takento establish the system. (b) <T3>Retirement system coverage groups. </T3>A retirement system coveragegroup is a grouping of employees in positions under a retirement system.Employees in positions under the system have voted for coverage for thesystem by referendum and a State has provided coverage by agreement ormodification of its agreement. It is not a permanent grouping. It existsonly for referendum and coverage purposes and is not a separate group forreporting purposes. Once coverage has been obtained, the retirememt systemcoverage group becomes part of one of the absolute coverage groups describedin andSection; 404.1205(b). (c) <T3>What a retirement system coverage group consists of. </T3>A retirementsystem coverage group consists of: (1) Current employees_all employees whose services are not already coveredby the agreement, who are in positions covered by the same retirement systemon the date an agreement or modification of the agreement is made applicableto the system; (2) Future employees_all employees in positions brought under the systemafter an agreement or modification of the agreement is signed; and (3) Other employees_all employees in positions which had been under theretirement system but which were not under the retirement system when thegroup was covered (including ineligibles who had been optionally excludedfrom coverage under section 218(c)(3)(B) of the Act). (d) <T3>Referendum procedures. </T3>Prior to signing the agreement or modification,the governor or an official of the State named by the governor (for aninterstate instrumentality, its chief executive officer) must certify tothe Secretary that: (1) All eligible employees were given at least 90 days' notice of the referendum;(2) All eligible employees were given an opportunity to vote in the referendum;(3) Only eligible employees were permitted to vote in the referendum;(4) Voting was by secret written ballot on the question of whether servicein positions covered by the retirement system should be included underan agreement; (5) The referendum was conducted under the supervision of the governoror agency or individual named by him; and (6) A majority of the retirement system's eligible employees voted forcoverage under an agreement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The State has two years from the date of a favorable referendum toenter into an agreement or modification extending coverage to the retirementsystem coverage group. If the referendum is unfavorable, another referendumcannot be held until at least one year after that unfavorable referendum.(e) <T3>Who is covered. </T3>If a majority of the eligible employees in a retirementsystem vote for coverage, all employees in positions in that retirementsystem become covered. (f) <T3>Coverage of employees in positions under more than one retirement system.</T3>(1) If an employee occupies two or more positions each of which isunder a different retirement system, the employee's coverage in each positiondepends upon the coverage extended to each position under each system.(2) If an employee is in a single position which is under more than oneretirement system (because the employee's occupancy of that position permitsher or him to become a member of more than one retirement system), theemployee is covered when the retirement system coverage group includingher or his position is covered under an agreement unless (A) he or sheis not a member of the retirement system being covered and (B) he or sheis a member of a retirement system which has not been covered. This rulealso applies to the coverage of services in policemen's and firemen's positionsin interstate instrumentalities and in those States named in andSection;404.1212(c)(1). <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 404.1207</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Divided retirement system coverage groups. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>Under section 218(d)(6)(C) of the Act certain Statesand under section 218(g)(2) of the Act all interstate instrumentalitiesmay divide a retirement system based on whether the employees in positionsunder that system want coverage. The States having this authority are Alaska,California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts,Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania,Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. (b) <T3>Divided retirement system coverage group. </T3>A divided retirementsystem coverage group is a grouping under a retirement system of positionsof members of the system who voted for coverage and positions of individualswho become members of the system (the ``yes'' group), and positions ofmembers of the system who did not elect coverage (the ``no'' group) andineligible employees (see andSection; 404.1208). For purposes of this sectionfor groups covered after 1959, the term ``member'' also includes individualswho have an option to become members of the retirement system but havenot done so. The position of a member in the ``no'' group can be coveredif, within two years after the agreement or modification extending coverageto the ``yes'' group is executed, the State provides an opportunity totransfer the position to the covered ``yes'' group and the individual occupyingthe position makes a written request for the transfer. The members of the``no'' group can also be covered if, by referendum, a majority of themvote for coverage. If the majority votes for coverage, all positions ofthe members of the ``no'' group become covered. There is no further subdivisionof the ``no'' group into those who voted for and those who voted againstcoverage. If the State requests, the ineligibles in the ``no'' group maybecome part of the ``yes'' group and have their services covered. (c) <T3>Referendum procedures. </T3>To divide a retirement system, the Statemust conduct a referendum among the system's employees. If the system isto be divided, the governor or an individual named by him must certifyto the Secretary that: (1) The referendum was held by written ballot on the question of whethermembers of a retirement system wish coverage under an agreement; (2) All members of the retirement system at the time the vote was heldhad the opportunity to vote; (3) All members of the system on the date the notice of the referendumwas issued were given at least 90 days' notice regarding the referendum;(4) The referendum was conducted under the supervision of the governoror agency or person designated by him; and (5) The retirement system was divided into two parts, one composed of positionsof members of the system who voted for coverage and the other composedof the remaining positions under the retirement system.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">After the referendum the State may include those members who chosecoverage under its agreement as a retirement system coverage group.

They are: (a) Services in any class or classes of elective positions; (b) Services in any class or classes of part-time positions; (c) Services in any class or classes of positions where the pay is on afee basis; (d) Any agricultural labor or student services which would also be excludedif performed for a private employer; and (e) Services performed by election officials or election workers if thepayments for those services: (1) In a calendar quarter are less than $50; or (2) For modifications executed after 1977, in a calendar year are lessthan $100. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 404.1211</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Interstate instrumentalities. </ITAG>For Social Security coverage purposes under section 218 of the Act, interstateinstrumentalities are treated, to the extent practicable, as States, thatis: (a) They must be legally authorized to enter into an agreement with theSecretary; (b) They are subject to the same rules that are applied to the States;(c) They may divide retirement systems and cover only the positions ofmembers who want coverage; and (d) They may provide coverage for firemen and policemen in positions undera retirement system. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 404.1212</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Policemen and firemen. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>For Social Security coverage purposes under section 218of the Act, a policeman's or fireman's position is any position so classifiedunder State statutes or court decisions. Generally, these positions arein the organized police and fire departments of incorporated cities, towns,and villages. In most States, a policeman is a member of the ``police''which is an organized civil force for maintaining order, preventing anddetecting crimes, and enforcing laws. The terms ``policeman'' and ``fireman''do not include services in positions which, although connected with policeand firefighting functions, are not policeman or fireman positions. (b) <T3>Providing coverage. </T3>A State may provide coverage of: (1) Policemen's and firemen's positions not under a retirement system aspart of an absolute coverage group; (2) Policemen's or firemen's positions, or both, as part of a retirementsystem coverage group for the States specified in paragraph (c)(1) of thissection; or (3) Firemen's positions only as a separate retirement system as set forthin paragraph (c)(2) of this section.(c) <T3>Policemen and firemen in positions under a retirement system. </T3>(1)Some States and all interstate instrumentalities may provide coverage foremployees in policemen's or firemen's positions, or both, which are undera retirement system by following the majority vote referendum proceduresin andSection; 404.1206(d). The States are Alabama, California, Florida,Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana,New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina,South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington. SomeStates and all interstate instrumentalities may use the desire for coverageprocedures in andSection; 404.1207. The States are California, Florida, Georgia,Hawaii, New York, North Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, and Washington.(2) All States not listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section may providecoverage for employees in firemen's positions which are under a retirementsystem by: (i) Following the referendum procedures in andSection; 404.1206(d); and (ii) Submitting a certification by the governor, or an individual namedby her or him, to the Secretary that extending coverage to this group ofemployees will improve their overall benefit protection. <ITAG tagnum="84">How Coverage Under Agreements Is Obtained and Continues  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 404.1214</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Agreement for coverage. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>A State may enter into a written agreement with the Secretaryto provide for Social Security coverage for its employees or the employeesof one or more of its political subdivisions.

(c) <T3>Authority to enter into an agreement for coverage_</T3>(1) <T3>Federal law. </T3>Section 218(a) of the Act requires the Secretaryto enter into an agreement, at the request of the State, to extend SocialSecurity coverage to the State's employees or those of its political subdivisions.Section 218(g) authorizes the Secretary to enter into an agreement, atthe request of an interstate instrumentality, to extend Social Securitycoverage to the employees of the interstate instrumentality. (2) <T3>State law. </T3>State law must authorize a State or an interstate instrumentalityto enter into an agreement with the Secretary for Social Security coverage.(d) <T3>Provisions of the agreement. </T3>The agreement must include: (1) A description of the specific services to be covered and excluded;(2) The State's promise to pay, to the Secretary of the Treasury, contributionsequal to the sum of the taxes which would be required under the FederalInsurance Contributions Act from employers and employees if the employmentwere in the private sector; (3) The State's promise to comply with the regulations the Secretary prescribesfor carrying out the provisions of section 218 of the Act; and (4) Identification of the political subdivisions, coverage groups, or servicesbeing covered and the services that are excluded.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The agreement must be signed by the authorized State or interstateinstrumentality official and the Secretary or his or her designee.

(f) <T3>Applicability of agreement. </T3>The agreement establishes the continuingrelationship between the Secretary and the State or interstate instrumentalityexcept as it is modified (see andSection;andSection; 404.1215-404.1217). <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 404.1215</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Modification of agreement. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>A State or interstate instrumentality may modify in writingits agreement, for example, to: (1) Exclude, in limited situations, employee services or positions previouslycovered; (2) Include additional coverage groups; or(3) Include as covered services: (i) Services of covered employees for additional retroactive periods oftime; and (ii) Services previously excluded from coverage. (b) <T3>Controlling date for retroactive coverage. </T3>A State may specifyin the modification a date to make all individuals in the coverage groupwho were in an employment relationship on that date eligible for retroactivecoverage. This date is known as the controlling date for retroactive coverage.It can be no earlier than the date the modification is mailed or otherwisedelivered to the Secretary nor can it be later than the date the modificationis signed by the Secretary.

In correcting this type of error, which affects the extentof coverage, the State must submit a modification along with evidence toestablish that the error occurred. However, a modification is not neededto correct minor typographical or clerical errors. For example, an agreementor modification incorrectly lists School District No. 12 as School DistrictNo. 13. This type of error can be corrected based on a written requestfrom the appropriate official of the State or interstate instrumentality.(b) <T3>Correction of errors involving erroneous reporting to the IRS_for wagespaid prior to 1987. </T3>Where a State or political subdivision makes reportsand payments to the Internal Revenue Service under the provisions of theFederal Insurance Contributions Act which apply to employees in privateemployment in the mistaken belief that this action would provide coveragefor its employees, the State may provide the desired coverage for thosesame periods of time by a subsequent modification to its agreement. IfState law permits, the State may make that coverage effective with thefirst day of the first period for which the erroneous reports and paymentswere made. (In this instance, the limitation on retroactive coverage describedin andSection; 404.1215(d) is not applicable.) Where the State does not wantto provide such retroactive coverage or is not permitted to do so by Statelaw, the State may provide the coverage for the affected coverage groupas of a specified date (andSection; 404.1215(b)). The coverage would thenapply to the services performed by individuals as members of the coveragegroup (1) Who were employees on that date, and (2) Whose wages were erroneously reported to IRS, and (3) For whom a refund of FICA taxes has not been obtained at the time theSecretary executes the modification. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 404.1217</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Continuation of coverage. </ITAG>The coverage of State and local government employees continues as follows:(a) <T3>Absolute coverage group. </T3>Generally, the services of an employeecovered as a part of an absolute coverage group (see andSection; 404.1205)continue to be covered indefinitely. A position covered as a part of anabsolute coverage group continues to be covered even if the position latercomes under a retirement system. This includes policemen's and firemen'spositions which are covered with an absolute coverage group. (b) <T3>Retirement system coverage group. </T3>Generally, the services of employeesin positions covered as a part of a retirement system coverage group continueto be covered indefinitely. For a retirement system coverage group madeup of members who chose coverage, a position continues to be covered untilit is removed from the retirement system and is no longer occupied by amember who chose coverage or by a new member of the system. Coverage isnot terminated because the positions are later covered under additionalretirement systems or removed from coverage under a retirement system,or because the retirement system is abolished with respect to the positions.However, if the retirement system has been abolished, newly created orreclassified positions or positions in a newly created political subdivisioncannot be covered as a part of the retirement system coverage group. Ifthe retirement system is not abolished, a newly created or reclassifiedposition is a part of the coverage group if the position would have beena part of the group had it existed earlier.

Similarly, in the case of an agreement with an interstateinstrumentality, SSA assigns one identification number to the instrumentality.SSA notifies the appropriate official of the State or instrumentality ofthe number assigned. (2) If a State or political subdivision is paying wages for covered transportationservice (as determined under section 210(k) of the Act) which are subjectto the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, the appropriate IRS ServiceCenter assigns an identification number to the State or political subdivision.The IRS Service Center procedures for issuing identification numbers toStates or political subdivisions may be found in 26 CFR 31.6011(b)-1.

SSA assigns a coverage group number toeach designated group based on the information furnished in the list. (c) <T3>Unit numbers for payroll record units. </T3>SSA assigns, at a State'srequest, unit numbers to payroll record units within a State or politicalsubdivision. When a State requests separate payroll record unit numbers,it must furnish the following: (1) The name of each payroll record unit for the coverage group; and (2) The title and business address of the official responsible for eachpayroll unit. (d) <T3>Unit numbers where contribution amounts are limited_for wages paidprior to 1987. </T3>An agreement, or modification of an agreement, mayprovide for the computation of contributions as prescribed in andSection;404.1256 for some employees of a political subdivision.

However, if the total amount of the underpayment is 5 percentor less than 5 percent of the contributions due for a calendar year basedupon the State's wage report and the State deposits the underpaid amountwithin 30 days after the date of our notification to the State of the amountdue, the State may request that the interest on the underpaid amount bewaived for good cause.

In other instances,entities which are covered under an agreement erroneously report to IRS,or a State or local government employee reports other employees to IRSor reports to IRS as a self-employed individual. Where these reports andpayments are erroneously made to IRS, the State may correct the error andobtain coverage under its agreement as described in paragraphs (b) through(f) of this section.

In most cases, the State mayobtain coverage by a regular modification. If a regular modification cannotbe used (e.g., State law does not permit the retroactive effective datewhich would be desired), the State may use an error modification. The effectivedate of either modification depends on the facts of the situation beingcorrected.

We also advise the Statethat the entity which reported under FICA procedures should request a refundof payments erroneously made to IRS.

If the State wishes to provide coverage,it must submit a modification as discussed in paragraph (b) of this section.If the State does not wish to provide coverage, we void the reports. Amountsreported for periods barred by the statute of limitations remain on theearnings records.

TheState files the necessary reports with SSA and pays any contributions due.The reports shall conform to the coverage provided by the agreement tothe extent permitted by the statute of limitations. The due date for thesereports depends on whether original reports or adjustment reports are involved.Reports and contribution returns for the entire retroactive period of coverageprovided by a regular or error modification are due 90 days after the dateof execution of the modification. The time limitations for issuing assessmentsand credits or refunds extend from this due date. Thus, SSA may issue assessmentsor credits or refunds for periods barred to refund by IRS.
