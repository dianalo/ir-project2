Susan Barbier, 29, was convicted of first-degree criminal sexualconduct, the charge for rape in Michigan, for giving her daughter toa man who raped her twice.   The crime normally carries 10 to 25 years in prison, but CircuitJudge James J. Rashid said Barbier gave ``flagrantly falsetestimony'' at her trial and showed no potential for reform.   The man who raped the girl, Anthony Sawyer, 28, was convicted ofthe same charge and was sentenced Thursday by another judge to 40 to60 years in prison.   Barbier had maintained her innocence at all times and had alsoclaimed that she had been punished enough because her children hadbeen taken from her.   ``That is not a punishment for someone with such little regardfor her children,'' Rashid told her. ``Your daughter trusted you andyou abused that trust beyond all bounds of decency.''   Ramsey said Barbier's daughter called the 1988 rape ``the worsthour of my life.'' According to testimony by Sawyer, Barbier offeredher daughter to satisfy a drug debt, then smoked crack with Sawyerafterward.   Barbier is eligible for parole in 10 years.   Her former husband, Michael Dare, has been granted temporarycustody of the victim. Two other children, ages 6 and 8, are stayingwith a relative.   ``This case demonstrates tragically the far-reaching impact ofdrugs on innocent people,'' the judge said. ``I have not heard ofsuch a situation where drugs were responsible for a mothersubjecting her own daughter to sexual abuse.''</TEXT></DOC>
