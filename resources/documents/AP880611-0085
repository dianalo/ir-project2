(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Gov. Evan Mecham long hasacknowledged he didn't itemize a $350,000 campaign loan on hisfinancial statements, but it will be up to a jury to decide thisweek if that failure was a criminal act.   Closing arguments are scheduled Tuesday after seven days oftestimony in the trial of the impeached Mecham and his brother,Willard, on charges of concealing the loan.   The prosecution's case is based on ``smoke and mirrors,'' Mechamtold reporters after the defense rested its case Friday withouttestimony from either defendant.   ``I'm confident that the state has not proven its case,'' theformer governor said, although he stopped short of predicting hewill be acquitted.   ``We are confident that the jury will return a just verdict,''prosecutor Barnett Lotstein said Friday.   Mecham, a Republican, was removed from office April 4 byimpeachment conviction on two unrelated charges. The state Senatedecided not to consider a charge on the loan for fear ofprejudicing the criminal trial.   He also was the subject of a recall movement, but an electionwas canceled after his impeachment conviction.   Mecham, 64, first received national attention in January 1987for his decision to cancel a Martin Luther King holiday for stateexecutive branch workers on grounds it was illegally created by hispredecessor, Democrat Bruce Babbitt, without legislativeauthorization.   Mecham also drew criticism for defending an author's use of theword ``pickaninny'' in a book in reference to black children, andhe made a variety of statements that offended women, Jews,homosexuals and Japanese-Americans.   In the criminal case, he faces up to 22 years in prison ifconvicted on all six felony counts of perjury, willful concealmentand filing false documents.   Willard Mecham, who was treasurer for his younger brother's 1986campaign, faces up to 9{ years in prison if convicted of threesimilar counts.   The prosecution contended that Mecham's campaign badly neededthe $350,000 loan from developer Barry Wolfson, but that Mechamwanted to conceal its source because it would contradict hiscampaign theme of being ``beholden to no one.''   None of Mecham's personal or campaign financial reports lists a$350,000 loan from Wolfson. Instead, one campaign report includes a$465,000 lump sum identified as a contribution from Mecham himself.The $450,000 also included a $100,000 loan to Mecham from afinancial institution and a $15,000 contribution by Mecham.   The Mechams put up two defenses: that the loan was properlylisted as part of the $465,000 lump sum, and that the failure toitemize the loan was an innocent mistake by Willard Mecham.   Also, former top Mecham aide Edith Richardson testified for thedefense that the loan was ``common knowledge'' among Mecham's innercircle.   The prosecution said it was immaterial whether Mecham's closestaides knew about the Wolfson loan.   ``This is the document where the public gets its information,isn't that true?'' prosecutor Michael Cudahy asked one witness,referring to Mecham's contribution and expenditure report. ``I'mnot talking about insiders in the campaign, finance chairmen, closeconfidantes of Evan Mecham.''   Mecham long has acknowledged that the Wolfson loan appearednowhere on his financial statements outside of the $465,000 lumpsum, until he filed an amended form in November 1987.   He also insisted last fall that the loan was made to thecampaign, not to him personally.   But Wolfson testified that he considered the loan a personalone, not to the campaign.   A former Mecham campaign finance committee member, Vern Gasser,testified that he couldn't recall the meaning of notes he tookduring a committee meeting in fall 1986. The notes said ``show Evanborrowed money'' and ``don't show borrowed money.''   Mecham refused to say Friday why he did not testify. Hisattorney, Michael Scott, said he wanted to avoid having his client``brutalized'' on cross-examination.</TEXT></DOC>
