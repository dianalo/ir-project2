The basic design employstwo parallel leaky microwave pipes; one as an irradiator and the otheras the receiver. The feedstock is placed on a manually operated movingplatform and occupies fully the designated measurement zone. Experimentsshow that once the apparatus is properly calibrated, it is capable ofmaking rapid measurements of the tatal moisture content of the feedstockwithin the measurement zone irrespective of the size and shape of thefeedstock. Within the range of 10 to 50% of moisture content, resultscan be reproducible better than 3%. 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
