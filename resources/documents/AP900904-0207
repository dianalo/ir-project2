Many people tuck a calculator into purse or pocket beforeleaving home.   ``I have to think twice before going out to buy anything,'' saidSusana Montenegro, a middle-class housewife encountered in asupermarket. ``And not just because everything is so expensive.It's the conversions back and forth. They give me a headache.''   A new currency, called the gold cordoba, and the rules governingits value have made a confusing economy even more so.   Gold cordobas officially trade at par with the dollar and aresupposed to replace the old cordobas, which Nicaraguans havechristened ``chancheros,'' or ``piggies,'' to set them apart fromthe new ones.   When Mrs. Montenegro buys a 5-pound bag of beans she can pay ineither gold cordobas or dollars and get change in piggies at theofficial exchange rate, or she can pay the entire amount in piggies.   Into her decision and calculations, she must factor theprinciple that a piggy in hand should be a piggy spent quickly,because it will buy less next week.   Devaluations of the piggy, which occur each Monday, make lastweek's black market rate this week's official exchange rate,erasing what advantage there had been in trading with the``coyotes'' who deal in currency. In response, the coyotes changetheir own rate.   Francisco Mayorga, president of the central bank, hailed thegold cordoba as the cornerstone of the economic revival promised bythe new government, but it has been a mild flop.   Only $4 million worth have been released into the market sincethe gold cordoba's debut Aug. 13, about 5 percent of the totalmoney in circulation, and much of that is back in the bank vaults.   Few people use the gold cordoba. Suspicious consumers preferdollars, or even piggies, although 900,000 of them were needed tobuy a dollar at the end of August.   The government says it will issue only as many gold cordobas asit has dollars to back them up.   Official parity remains in effect, but real parity begandissolving when the government stores that sell foreign goods onlyfor dollars added a 1 percent charge for anyone paying with goldcordobas.   Coyotes won't touch the new currency.   ``Most people who buy dollars from me are merchants who go toHonduras and Guatemala to buy, and the gold cordobas are notaccepted over there,'' said one, who would not give his name. ``Thedollar is the dollar anywhere. The gold cordoba is something thatonly Panchito (Mayorga) likes.''   Public employees, who received 50 gold cordobas each as part oftheir pay, can use them to pay utility bills, which are higher nowthat subsidies have been ended.   Restaurants, supermarkets and other businesses have convertedprices to gold cordobas, but accept piggies at the official rateand dollars.   To cope with the rising cost of living, people usually changetheir gold cordobas at banks for dollars and trade the dollars forpiggies with street-corner coyotes, who pay about 10 percent abovethe official rate.   Mrs. Montenegro tries to keep up with exchange rates becausethere have been 40 devaluations this year, 33 of them underPresident Violeta Chamorro's government since it succeeded theSandinistas four months ago.   If she receives dollars from relatives in the United States, asmany Nicaraguans do, she is better off changing them on the blackmarket and paying bills in piggies.   Many Nicaraguans feel the higher rate on the black marketoffsets the risk of a police raid during the transaction.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wednesday Sept. 12</NOTE></DOC>
