Several of Asia's newly industrializing countries, as well as West Germany, joined criticism of the Senate action. But most officials appeared more disappointed than angered by it. The bill cleared the Senate 85-11 Wednesday and was sent to President Reagan, who is expected to sign it.    Reaction was strongest in Japan, the target of the proposed law's more stringent provisions. Japanese officials indicated the government is considering recourse to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, to counter what they termed the most significant shift in U.S. trade policy since World War II.    Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita termed the U.S. action &quot;unfortunate,&quot; citing its &quot;protectionist undertone.&quot; He hinted that Tokyo would continue to press Mr. Reagan to veto the bill, whose provisions are designed to pry open foreign markets to U.S. goods and bolster the competitive stance of American industries.    International Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura called the bill a &quot;great misfortune.&quot; He said Japan &quot;reserves the right to file suit with GATT.&quot;    In Taipei, a senior Taiwanese trade official said the bill &quot;is protectionist, but we can't appeal to GATT, like Japan or other countries, because we aren't a member.&quot; He added: &quot;We will regret it if President Reagan signs the bill.&quot; But he acknowledged the measure very likely would encourage Taiwan to open its markets wider.    The South Korean Foreign Ministry in Seoul also termed the bill protectionist and said that, if enacted, it would seriously hurt the free-trade system. Hong Kong acting Director of Trade Tony Miller said he hoped the bill would help &quot;reduce some of the pent-up protectionist pressures in Congress.&quot; However, he said, the British territory objects to the measure's &quot;bilateral&quot; approach to international trade problems and its reduction of the president's discretion in implementing trade policy.    In Europe, West Germany's economics minister, Martin Bangemann, said the bill &quot;could turn out to be a strong burden on free international trade.&quot; He appealed to the Reagan administration to implement the policies outlined in the measure &quot;with as much restraint as possible.&quot;    Japan has been especially wary of the bill's three-year retaliatory provisions against Toshiba Corp. and its affiliates in the U.S. in the wake of a 1987 scandal involving sales of militarily sensitive milling equipment to the Soviet Union by a Toshiba subsidiary.    Joichi Aoi, president and chief executive officer of Toshiba Corp., criticized as &quot;grossly unjust&quot; the Senate passage and the bill's sanction clause directed against the giant electronics concern.    But three big Japanese securities firms that risk losing their elite status as primary dealers in U.S. government securities reacted fairly calmly to the Senate action. The bill would repeal the firms' status within a year of passage unless their American counterparts receive equal opportunities in Japan.    The parent companies -- Nomura Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co. and Nikko Securities Co. -- expressed the hope that Tokyo would find a way to prevent punitive action from being taken against them.    &quot;Since Nomura is the industry leader in securities, we are doing our best&quot; to prevent retaliation, a Nomura official said. </TEXT></DOC>
