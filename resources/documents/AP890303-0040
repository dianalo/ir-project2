So new is the practice of genetic engineering, cloning, embryotransfer and other scientific feats that Hassebrook and others atthe center fear there hasn't been enough attention paid to the basicresearch agenda involving biotechnology.   A new report, ``Choices for the Heartland: Alternative Directionsin Biotechnology and Implications for Rural America,'' written byHassebrook and colleague Gabriel Hegyes has been issued by thecenter, based in Walthill, Neb.   ``The expense and sophistication of biotechnology will narrow therange of individuals directly involved in breeding animals andplants,'' the report said. ``Questions about who will be served bythis technology and who will set the research agenda are ofparamount importance when so few people control the tools andlanguage of the trade.''   Private companies, the Agriculture Department, state and regionalexperiment facilities, and the agricultural scientific community ingeneral are advancing rapidly into biotechnology frontier.   Crops with built-in ``insecticides'' and livestock with geneticcapabilities to produce more meat and milk are some of the obviousgoals.   ``Properly directed, agricultural research and biotechnology canmake agriculture more efficient by providing ways to replace capitaland purchased inputs (production items) with the labor andmanagement of more family farmers,'' the report said.   For example, the center said a new development which could save afarmer $5 per hog produced in return for an additional $2 worth oftime spent on management and labor would ``increase family farmopportunities and make agriculture more efficient by decreasingproduction costs.''   Hassebrook outlined the report Thursday to House and Senateagriculture committee staffers in hopes of gathering congressionalsupport for a closer scrutiny of biotechnology's rapidly developingrole in the structure of American agriculture.   ``Agricultural research is almost a form of social planning, inthat the decisions you make about what research you're going topursue is going to have a lot to do with shaping agriculture,''Hassebrook said in an interview.   The essence of the center's report is that there are twodirections that can be followed by the biotechnology wave:   One path leads to ``industrial production systems'' that continuethe trend toward larger and fewer farms, continuous production ofone or two high-value cash crops, and large-scale livestockoperations that require high investment and total confinement.   The other route is to ``low-input, sustainable'' family farmsystems designed to preserve soil and water resources. Farmers usingthese systems seek to improve farm profits by cutting back oncapital investments and reducing purchases of fertilizers,pesticides and other production items.   ``We could use biotechnology to make agriculture more sustainableand to strengthen family farms, or we could use it to go in theother direction,'' Hassebrook said. ``The problem is that very feware asking these questions ... it's almost kind of leaving it tochance.''   The Center for Rural Affairs is a non-profit family farm researchand advocacy group that began in 1973. Hassebrook has been with itsince 1976.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Agriculture Department says the SovietUnion has bought an additional 485,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat atsubsidized prices.   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department'sForeign Agricultural Service, said Thursday the wheat was part of anauthorization on Jan. 25 of more than 2 million tons under theExport Enhancement Program, or EEP.   Sims said the wheat is for shipment for April. Counting some leftover from a previous EEP arrangement and the Jan. 25 authorization,the Soviets have 525,200 tons still available under the program.   With the latest sale, the Soviet Union has bought almost 3.5million tons of wheat for delivery in the sixth year of a long-termsupply agreement, which was extended last fall to run through Dec.31, 1990.   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushelsof wheat. The 485,000 tons are equal to about 17.8 million bushelsworth around $73 million at recent U.S. farm prices.   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat andother designated commodities to specified countries at reducedprices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters thencollect free government surpluses of grain or other products asbonuses, or subsidies.   Sales for delivery in the sixth year of the agreement alsoincluded about 10.2 million tons of corn, along with 450,000 tons ofsoybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean meal, and 507,400 tons ofgrain sorghums.   Sims said the 485,000 tons of wheat were sold by The Peavey Co.,110,000 tons; Continental Grain Co., 100,000; Bunge Corp., 100,000;Ferruzzi USA Inc., 150,000; and Mitsubishi International, 25,000.   The companies will get subsidies of $22.46 per ton, or about 61cents per bushel, under the EEP arrangement.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Corn and sorghum growers who participated inlast year's feed grain program will get about $125 million from theAgriculture Department this month.   Milton Hertz, executive vice president of the department'sCommodity Credit Corp., said Thursday the payments will be in theform of generic certificates, which are redeemable in surpluscommodities held by the CCC.   About $85 million will be paid to eligible corn farmers and $40million to sorghum producers.   Most corn farmers, upon request, were paid about $2.6 billion atthe time they signed up in the 1988 program, and sorghum farmerscollected about $288 million in advance payments, Hertz said.</TEXT></DOC>
