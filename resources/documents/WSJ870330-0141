The introduction will be the most significant in the personal computer industry since IBM entered the nascent field in summer 1981 -- and to make sure the world takes notice, IBM has set up the biggest dog-and-pony show the industry has seen in at least the past three years. Dealers say IBM then will unleash $50 million of new-product advertising.    &quot;It's like doomsday,&quot; says Ron Posner, chief executive officer of closely held Ansa Software of Belmont, Calif. &quot;Everybody in the industry is asking everybody else where they'll be April 2.&quot;    Come Thursday morning, IBM will show the new products to hundreds of analysts and high-tech tea-leaf readers at a midtown hotel in New York. Meanwhile, IBM's big corporate customers -- lush sales turf that the new products are designed to protect -- will gather for video conference briefings in as many as 40 cities. In addition, more than 300 reporters have been given unusually early notice of a major news conference in midtown Manhattan Thursday morning.    The biggest push, however, will come in Miami, where IBM executives will wine and dine 2,500 dealers in hotels rented out by IBM. The bash will begin with a dinner Wednesday night and continue with product demonstrations Thursday and Friday at the Miami Beach Convention Center.    The wooing of dealers is even more important than usual for Big Blue because it recently has begun to tighten its control over vendors of its products, offering them more business if they will become true-Blue.    Basically, one dealer says, IBM &quot;is trying to get us so busy that we spend 90% of our time selling IBM and eventually become their stores.&quot;    IBM is telling its 2,300 dealers that if they want to be allowed to sell the new products, they must go through an extensive retraining program. They also must meet stiff sales quotas or stock lackluster IBM products, such as the slow-selling RT PC.    The company is pulling back many salesmen from the PC arena, leaving more of the territory free for dealers. At the same time, though, IBM is expected to winnow out enough weak or unfaithful dealers so that a third of the current dealers won't be allowed to sell most of the new products.    &quot;IBM will really begin to manage this as part of their business,&quot; a dealer says. The computer giant declined to comment. &quot;We're not going to get into that right now,&quot; a spokesman says. &quot;Numerous details will come out shortly.&quot;    The company is clearly worried, though, because many dealers have been attracting customers by brandishing IBM products and then have pushed them to buy lower-priced PC clones, which typically provide a bigger profit margin. When they do sell IBM products, dealers often bundle in other manufacturers' options, such as disk drives. The new quotas, however, could make dealers hesitate to sell another manufacturer's PCs or peripheral devices.    &quot;Will IBM get away with this?&quot; one dealer asks rhetorically. &quot;Without a doubt.&quot;    Dealers are reluctant to talk for the record because the usually secretive IBM has been extraordinarily so on this go-round. Many dealers and customers are convinced that IBM is giving them slightly conflicting information, so that any details leaked to the media can be traced back to the source.    As a result, the specifics of the announcement remain vague. IBM is expected to announce a low-end machine for the home and education market, some more-powerful versions of its current PC AT and some products based on the relatively new and extremely powerful Intel Corp. 80386 chip. Most models are expected to have much stronger graphics capabilities and will be able to communicate better with other IBM computers.    IBM, which has lost considerable market share because of pressure from low-priced clones, is expected to include proprietary features in the new models, which will make them more difficult to copy. As part of that effort, IBM is expected to introduce a proprietary operating system that will allow existing software to run on the IBM machines, but this will mean that software developed for the new hardware won't run on existing PCs.    The pricing is unclear -- IBM itself apparently hasn't decided on some products' prices -- but dealers say all the machines will cost even less than the less-powerful machines they will replace.    In recent days, many executives at competing companies have made the rounds, assuring analysts and reporters that although some companies will be hurt by the new products, it certainly will be the other guy.    For instance, Blue Chip Electronics, a clone distributor that analysts think will face as stiff a challenge as any company, recently said that IBM's announcement probably would affect only &quot;a few Taiwanese companies.&quot;    Apple Computer Inc.'s chairman, John Sculley, describes the next two years as &quot;our breakaway period&quot; because it will take so long to develop software for IBM's new hardware. Yet some students of history may recall that Apple ran a smug ad in 1981 welcoming IBM to the PC market -- then watched as IBM's market share quickly dwarfed Apple's.    In any case, competitors seem ready to finally face reality and either take their lumps or perhaps profit from any weaknesses in the IBM line.    &quot;It's hard to compete against paper products,&quot; says Ben Rosen, chairman of Compaq Computer Corp. &quot;They always have infinite capability and zero cost.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
