This evolution is occurring just as the demand for system-widepipeline data is escalating. The SCADA System must interface with stationautomation systems and automated metering systems, provide supervisorycontrol functions for Gas Controllers/Dispatchers, and interface withAccounting's billing systems, Planning's modeling and simulation systems,and even users outside the company. This paper discusses the changingtools of SCADA Systems: the transducers, the data acquisition devices,the communication systems, the Master computers, and the software totie it all together. The roles of the SCADA user and the SCADA Systemvendor are examined as technological change creates problems and pitfallsfor buyer and seller alike. Each must understand the needs of the userand the capabilities of the system to achieve a cost-effective solution.</TEXT></DOC>
