Invoking her rights against self-incrimination, Deborah GoreDean, onetime executive assistant to former housing secretary SamuelPierce, declined to answer questions about her involvement in theprocess to select which projects would be funded by the Departmentof Housing and Urban Development's Section 8 Moderate RehabilitationProgram.   ``In view of my present inability to obtain access to the HUDrecords which would enable me to give accurately testimony thatwould be complete and truthful, I respectfully have decided todecline to answer any questions posed by the subcommittee at thistime on the basis of the rights guaranteed to me under the FifthAmendment to the Constitution of the United States.''   Dean, the sole witness to be subpoenaed by the House GovernmentOperations subcommittee on employment and housing, is also the onlyone who has refused to testify. Dean was accompanied by twoattorneys, including former U.S. Attorney for the District ofColumbia Joseph DiGenova.   Panel chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., told Dean he and thesubcommittee would assist her in obtaining the documents she needed.But Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., questioned whether the extensivelist of documents requested by her attorneys, including all ofPierce's phone logs and appointments between January 1984 andDecember 1988, was reasonable.   Earlier, another HUD official told congressional investigatorsthat political influence was involved in the program's selectionprocess.   Silvio DeBartolomeis, former general deputy assistant secretaryin the Department of Housing and Urban Development and actingcommissioner of housing, said that he ``left town'' to avoid signingdocuments approving funding for two projects under HUD's Section 8Moderate Rehabilitation Program.   ``I didn't intend to sign them'' without the recommendation ofcareer employees, DeBartolomeis told the   But he said he was subsequently ordered to sign the documents byDean.   ``I would have to say that there were political influencesinvolved,'' DeBartolomeis said in describing the program. It hascome under congressional scrutiny since a HUD inspector general'sinvestigative audit found several appointees of former PresidentReagan profited as consultants to many projects that receivedfederal funds.   DeBartolomeis said ``the people that were politically connected''were the ones who profited from the program.   ``I never really was part of that selection process,'' he added.Pierce has testified that he had set up a three-person selectioncommittee composed of DeBartolomeis, Dean and a departmentundersecretary.   Lantos said in his opening statement that the investigation intothe program ``has opened a can of worms at HUD.''   He said recent revelations that private escrow agents may havediverted millions of dollars from sales of HUD foreclosureproperties indicated ``Pierce decided that those HUD programs whichcould not be killed by budget slashing could be killed by neglect.''   DeBartolomeis said that one of his concerns about the moderaterehabilitation program was that career HUD staffers, whom he hadcome to respect and depend on, were not involved in thedecision-making.   ``I felt that it could be viewed that these were being done in apolitical manner,'' said DeBartolomeis.   He said he expressed his concerns to Dean, whom he viewed ``asthe final decision-maker.''</TEXT></DOC>
