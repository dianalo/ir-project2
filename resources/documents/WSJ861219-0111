IbrahimStaff Reporter of the Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/19/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTPETROLEUM (PET)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><DATELINE> GENEVA, Switzerland  </DATELINE><TEXT>    After eight days of talks, amajority of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesappears very close to an agreement to trim a total ofapproximately one million barrels a day from OPEC's currentdaily oil production of about 17 million barrels.   Twelve of OPEC's 13 members said they would abide by the accord, which will be valid at least until June, when the group is scheduled to hold an official meeting. Only Iraq is expected to stay outside of the agreement, OPEC sources said.    According to ministerial sources, OPEC production would drop to around 16 million barrels a day starting in January. All of the 12 countries would cut their output by a general average of 7%, sources said, to arrive at that level.    Oil prices rose in volatile trading, setting a record for futures-trading volume on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The January futures contract closed at $16.06, up 20 cents, a barrel. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, rose 20 cents to $16.05 a barrel.    A turnaround from the general pessimism that prevailed at the meeting on Wednesday came about, sources said, under strong pressure from Saudi Arabia.    Sources said King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, who is pushing hardest for an agreement, held talks and contacts with the chiefs of state of Iraq, Libya and Algeria to remove any obstacles. The sources also said Iran apparantly is no longer objecting to an OPEC agreement without Iraq, thus making it possible for 12 of OPEC's members to adopt the production cut.    Saudi Arabia also is understood to have made some political and economic concessions to Iraq and Iran in order to ease the way toward an agreement, including a pledge for more economic help to Iraq in the form of free oil or financial aid, and greater political coordination with Iran, sources said.    OPEC sources said Iraq is likely to stay outside the agreement, as it has since August when OPEC reverted to a policy of restricting production to boost prices.    Iraq has followed a policy of producing all the oil it can export after meeting its internal consumption needs. Until recently, Iraq was pumping as much as two million barrels a day, but its production fell to about 1.6 million barrels daily when Saudi Arabia closed a pipeline to the Red Sea that Iraq also used to transport part of its oil exports.    Sources said the proposed agreement nearly was announced yesterday but was held back because the language of the communique spelling out the accord needed to be revised to &quot;minimize any appearance of conflict,&quot; one minister said.    Among other things, Iran is insisting on a clause stating that if its rival Iraq fails to adhere to the accord within two months, OPEC should meet again to revise Iraq's status. Yet, sources said, this Iranian stand wasn't strong enough to scuttle an accord.    Saudi Arabia also is insisting that a reference to its goal of pursuing a fixed price for OPEC oil be alluded to in the communique. Sources said that to satisfy this Saudi demand, OPEC will state that the price difference between OPEC's heaviest oil and its lightest, most expensive oil be fixed at $2.65 a barrel.    OPEC delegates said none of these details will matter until prices rise to the general level of $18 a barrel from $15 currently and OPEC meets again to seriously examine how to set a fixed price for its oil. </TEXT></DOC>
