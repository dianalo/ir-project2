Attention is given to the fusion oflidar and FLIR for target segmentation and enhancement, the synergeticintegration of thermal and visual images for computer vision, the 'FalconEye' FLIR system, multifunctional electrooptics and multiaperture sensorsfor precision-guided munitions, and AI approaches to data integration.Also discussed are the comparative performance of Ir silicide and Ptsilicide photodiodes, high fill-factor silicide monolithic arrays, andthe characterization of noise in staring IR focal plane arrays.</TEXT></DOC>
