This was thefirst to involve men in the highest positions.   This has been a costly and disastrous experience for allthe other people at Salomon Brothers as well as the manystockholders. Not only have they suffered a substantial lossthrough their ownership of company stock, they have suffereda major blow to their pride and confidence in the firm'sleadership. The impact of the scandal is far-reaching, withthe Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury embarrassed by thebreach of conduct. And now, Congress is investigating allaspects of the government securities marketplace.</LP><TEXT>   It takes years to establish a reputation for integrity,ethical business practice, and concern for business customersand competitors. Since 1910, my father, his brothers and Istrove with the loyal help of all in our organization tobuild a trusted reputation. This has been severely tested inrecent weeks. The six individuals in top management earnedhuge incomes that make it difficult to find a motive behindtheir strange performance. &quot;Greed,&quot; &quot;arrogance,&quot; &quot;hubris,&quot;&quot;chutzpah&quot; are some of the favorite words used by the mediato account for their behavior. The tone was put into practiceby the chairman during his leadership. He himself reveled inthe title bestowed upon him by Business Week: &quot;The King ofWall Street.&quot;   Warren Buffett {Salomon's new chairman} must now restorethe faith of the firm's employees, clients and the investmentindustry. He has started making many of the necessary changesin the management structure. However, a complete severance ofall ties to the six members of management who broughtdisgrace to the firm is now essential. This meansspecifically no payment of legal fees, no office facilities,no severance distribution. When this is accomplished, SalomonBrothers will be able to start on the road to recovery.   William R.
