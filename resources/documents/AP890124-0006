But, by golly, there was the new president up on stage trying tomatch licks _ and looks _ with Lee Atwater, the Wunderkind of GOPpolitics and atavistic rhythm and blues man from Columbia, S.C.   It was Saturday night at the final and finest bash of theinaugural weekend, a rollicking party for young Americans at theConvention Center that will go down as one of the new RepublicanParty chairman's greatest triumphs.   Atwater lived out a Chuck Barry fantasy on stage, falling to hisknees and writhing on his back while belting out ``High-HeeledSneakers'' with such heavy hitters as Sam Moore, Percy Sledge andguitarists Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones and Steve Cropper of BluesBrothers fame, as well as longtime sidekick Donald ``Duck'' Dunn onbass.   And there was George Bush, who practically had to be dragoonedinto dancing a few ceremonial steps with the first lady at Fridaynight's balls, taking it all in, giving a double thumbs-up sign andthen mounting the stage himself to accept a gleaming white Gibsonguitar marked ``THE PREZ'' from Moore, sole survivor of the soulduo, Sam and Dave.   Barbara Bush and several of the Bush children were among theclapping crowd that cheered the musicians on during the frenetic jamsession.   ``This has got to be the most active event of the inauguration,''said Bush, in the understatement of the year. ``That was marvelous,absolutely wonderful.''   And when the band began beating out ``Soul Man,'' the presidentdutifully began finger-picking ``THE PREZ,'' making no sound becausethe guitar wasn't plugged in, but doing a mean imitation of the fishface that Atwater assumed at the height of his guitar ecstasy.</TEXT><TEXT>   If the Atwater affair was the only inaugural party thatregistered on the Richter scale, the Texas ``Black Tie and Boots''shindig earlier Saturday night wasn't half-bad.   The president teased photographers _ and the crowd _ by liftinghis pants leg to offer fleeting glimpses of the map of Texasenameled on his boots.   It had to be the first time anyone ever yelled at Bush: ``Take'em off!''   ``Stop whistling at me,'' he rejoined.   Barbara Bush cracked, ``What I ought to do is make George standon his head and really show you those boots.''   The first couple tarried longer at the Texas party than they hadat any of the balls, staying to sing both ``Texas, Our Texas,'' thestate song and ``God Bless America.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Bush may have Martin Van Buren to thank for his example of how asitting vice president can capture the White House. But he also hasVan Buren to blame for the 15 stops he made in Friday's marathonball-hopping.   Van Buren was the first president to have two inaugural balls,and he infuriated supporters by attending only the higher-pricedone. Since then, every president has felt compelled to visit all theballs, even as they multiplied into the teens.   It meant crossing the capital in a long but silent motorcadeunder moonlit skies from 8 p.m. EST Friday until 12:45 a.m. Saturday.   The second stop, at the District of Columbia Armory, set thepattern, with people in evening gowns and tuxedos jammed up againstthe stage, armed with cameras, intent on checking out Barbara's gownand shaking Bush's hand. Although it was a youth ball, most of thepeople who had muscled to the front would never see 40 again.   As the hours wore on, and the waits grew longer, the crowds grewtestier. When the media pool came in to block their view momentsbefore the president's arrival, ball-goers screamed and booed, onlyto be assured by a tuxedoed Secret Service agent that the reporterswould crouch when Bush arrived.   The newly remodeled Union Station _ still a train depot, but nowfilled with chic shops as well _ looked enchanting, like a set froma Hollywood movie of the 1940s, with the crowd of swells lined up togreet the Bushes, who gazed down upon the scene from a balcony.   But few stops seemed as memorable. There was no waltzing going onwhen the Bushes came in _ just the same densely packed throngswaiting for their picture or handshake.   As the presidential party beat its retreat from one ball, ayoung, dark-haired woman in evening gown desperately gave a reportertwo postcards she had hoped to give Bush: handwritten pleas for helpfor relatives behind the Iron Curtain.   A White House aide took them to forward to the president's mailhandlers.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Christopher Connell, a reporter in the Washingtonbureau of The Associated Press since 1976, accompanied PresidentBush to all the inaugural parties Friday and Saturday night.</TEXT></DOC>
