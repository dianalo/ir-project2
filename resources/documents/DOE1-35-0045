Exposureof beagles currently on study was initiated in 1970 with {sup 239}PuO{sub2}, in 1973 with {sup 238}PuO{sub 2}, and in 1976 with {sup 239}Pu(NO{sub3}){sub 4}. These experiments involve more than 500 animals, many ofthem still alive. Experiments seeking to explain the increased incidenceof lung cancer in uranium miners have been in progress since 1966. Presentemphasis is on studies with rats, in an attempt to define dose-effectrelationships at the lowest feasible radon-daughter exposure levels.Our very-low-level experiment with inhaled {sup 239}PuO{sub 2} in rats,with exposures still under way, includes 1000 rats in the control groupand 1000 rats in the lowest-exposure group, where life-span lung dosesof andless;5 rads are anticipated.</TEXT></DOC>
