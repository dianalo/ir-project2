Areddy (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> BNK FIN FND </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Certificates of deposit yields were little changed in the latest week, as the regional discrepancies continue to disappear.    New York banks lowered consumer rates for the second straight week to 8.28% for a one-year CD, from 8.38% last week, according to Banxquote Online, a New York information service. The New York banks still pay the highest average yields, but Pennsylvania banks aren't far behind with an average one-year yield of 8.11%, unchanged from the previous week.    Florida and Illinois institutions pushed yields up on the midterm maturity. Florida banks increased the average one-year yield to 8.08%, from 8%. Illinois's big banks increased one-year yields to an average 7.84% from 7.74%, Banxquote said.    The spread between the highest average one-year yields and the lowest, from region to region, has narrowed to 93 basis points, from as much as 124 basis points in late August, according to Banxquote. Two weeks back, the spread was 114 basis points.    Norberto Mehl, publisher of Banxquote, noted that this week individual banks made yield adjustments on certain maturity issues, but the moves were often offset by adjustments in other maturities, resulting in very little overall change. He added that &quot;some other credit market instruments have been significantly influenced by declining oil prices,&quot; but that influence may not be felt until tomorrow's U.S. employment figures are released.    &quot;Rates have been drifting down for the past few weeks. But no one is sure if that is a long-term trend or a short-term aberration,&quot; says Robert J. Hutchinson, senior vice president, Manufacturers Hanover Bank. &quot;Wait till Friday,&quot; he adds. If total employment figures are high, suggesting inflation, the CD yields will be pushed up, but if they fall, posted yields will go down too, he says.    Banxquote said the average yield for 30-day retail certificates of deposit was unchanged at 6.43% yesterday.    The average six-month CD rose to 7.61% yesterday, from 7.59% the week before. The average one-year CD yield, meantime, was down one basis point, or 1/100 of a point, to 7.94%. The 2 1/2-year was up two basis points to 8.11%. The five-year CD was unchanged at 8.51%.    The average yield for money market accounts inched up to 6.23%, from 6.22% last week, according to Banxquote, the smallest move since July.    These bank accounts compete with money market mutual funds, whose average seven-day compounded yield rose to 7.77% in the week ended Tuesday from 7.71% a week earlier, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass., newsletter. The average yield, over 30 days, rose to 7.71% from 7.68%. </TEXT></DOC>
