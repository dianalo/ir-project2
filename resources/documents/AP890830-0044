Dr. Pe Thein, addressing a Rangoon meeting Tuesday of scholarsjust back from education overseas, said ``students must see thetruth behind last year's incidents.'' A transcript of his remarks,reported in an official Radio Rangoon broadcast, was seen today inBangkok.   Diplomats, dissidents and international human rights groupsestimate several thousand people were killed last year in a seriesof army clampdowns on student-led unrest from March to September.   According to witness accounts and independent reports, scores ofstudents were among those killed as troops fired indiscriminatelyinto crowds of peaceful demonstrators.   ``I don't mean to say that there were no casualties, only thatthere were few casualties, of which students constitute so small anumber as to be not worth mentioning,'' Pe Thein said.   The military government admitted killing hundreds as it crusheddissent in September, but it said most were ``looters'' or``destructive ... unscrupulous elements.''   Last June, all schools and universities throughout the countrywere closed because of the unrest. Though primary and middle schoolsrecently re-opened, university and high schools remain closed.   The minister said the country needed technocrats andintellectuals to reconstruct the nation, but ``school teachers(must) guide their students to becoming clever people and ...(to)avoid taking part in destructive acts.''   Pe Thein told the scholars that attempts were being made to tryto divide the army and the people in Burma.   He accused foreign broadcasting stations of using ``human rightsissues to portray themselves as the only ones who love the countryand report that the defense forces do not love the nation.''   ``The defense forces have been portrayed by some as a barbaricforce,'' he said.   He warned teachers, as public servants, to stay clear of partypolitics. ``Despite repeated warnings, we have had to part ways withsome (teachers) because of their contacts with political parties,''he said.   Western diplomats in Rangoon have reported authorities arrestedat least 2,000 people since putting the two leaders of the mainopposition group under house arrest on July 20.   Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo, who head the National League forDemocracy, were accused of trying to divide the people and themilitary after criticizing the government's human rights record.   The U.S. Embassy in Rangoon says it has received ``credible''reports that many pro-democracy activists have been tortured,sometimes fatally, after being arrested.</TEXT></DOC>
