<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-22-0803 </DOCNO><TEXT>A free-electron laser is being built whose electron-beam source is the185-MeV CW racetrack microtron (RTM) presently nearing completion. Thisaccelerator is characterized by extremely good emittance epsilon/subn/ somewhat andless; 10 micrometers and small energy spread delta gamma/gammasomewhat andless; .0003 at full energy. A new photocathode injector operatingon the 32nd subharmonic of the 2380-MHz RF frequency is being developedto increase the peak current to somewhat andgt; 2 A in 3-ps micropulses. Thewiggler design has 130 periods of lambda/sub w/ = 28 mm with RMS wigglerparameter K somewhat andless; 1. Three-dimensional calculations indicated thatpower gains of 10-30% per pass can be achieved for optical wavelengthsin the range 200 nm to 10.0 micrometers. The design of the RTM and FELare described. This FEL is intended for use in a broad program of researchapplications in biomedicine and materials science.</TEXT></DOC>
