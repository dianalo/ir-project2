The result: searing inflation that analysts say will get worse unless the Communist Party leadership takes the politically difficult move of turning off the money spigot.    Instead of borrowing money, the central bank has for years been printing it to finance the government's mounting budget deficits and prop up unprofitable state-run enterprises. Inflation, by the official measure, jumped to 13% in 1988's first half from a year earlier, compared with 7.3% for all of 1987 and 2.7% in 1984.    The year-on-year rate of increase accelerates almost monthly, rising to 19% in June. Moreover, even those discouraging figures may mask a harsher reality; many Chinese and foreign economists estimate inflation this year is running at least twice as high as the official estimate.    Part of the problem is the willingness of China's central bank to lend money at artificially low rates to factories that might otherwise shut down. &quot;The cause of the inflation isn't price reform but excess money,&quot; says Daniel Gressel, an economist with G.T. Management (Asia) Ltd. in Hong Kong.    M2, the broad money-supply measure that includes currency, checking accounts and savings deposits, grew 31% in the third quarter of last year from a year earlier, according to the most recent figures published by the International Monetary Fund. M2 grew an average 35% annually in the three-year period ended in 1986, while real, or inflation-adjusted, gross national product rose an average 10.6%. GNP, which measures the value of a nation's production of goods and services, rose at an annual rate of 11% in 1988's first half.    Luo Shilin, a vice president of the People's Bank of China in Shanghai, says the money supply has continued to soar this year. In the first half, the central banker says, bank loans throughout China rose sharply compared with 1987's first half. &quot;I'm afraid the situation is becoming even more precarious,&quot; Mr. Luo says.    Economists say China is paying the price for pushing ahead with economic reforms without having first installed sophisticated financial regulations. Because China doesn't have a developed bond market to provide the government with capital, its deficits have been largely financed by money creation. Under China's centrally planned economy, profits made by enterprises go to the state coffers, which also cover the losses.    When the deficits were small, the government could get away with printing money, economists say. But over the past two years Beijing has had to dig ever deeper into its pockets to subsidize factories hit hard by rocketing raw-material prices.    This, plus swelling price subsidies, helped widen China's deficit to eight billion yuan ($2.15 billion) last year, representing 3% of total expenditure, according to official figures. The amount, though regarded by economists as manageable, is much bigger than the government is used to.    In an attempt to remedy the situation, the Ministry of Finance plans to issue eight billion yuan in bonds this year, the first time China has turned to bonds to finance its budget deficit, Chinese officials say.    Aside from mishandling its budget, bankers say, Beijing has also failed to regulate the country's credit system. Despite some recent financial reforms, the People's Bank has remained a funnel for allocating investment funds. When a factory manager wants to borrow, he goes to his banker, who in turn goes to the central bank, which will supply much of the funding. &quot;The idea is that if enterprises don't have enough money, they can also ask the central bank for more,&quot; the People's Bank's Mr. Luo says.    China's economic reforms have intensified its money-management problems. While removing some of the inertia, the reforms have encouraged factories to rapidly expand borrowings. But the heavier the investment, the more loans the central bank makes and the more money it pumps into circulation.    Now enterprises and domestic banks are being urged to turn to the budding bond market for funds. Banks are also being encouraged to borrow from the two-year-old national interbank market in Shanghai. In 1987, transactions on the market totaled 26.8 billion yuan, and as a result the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank was able to reduce its lending to local banks by 19% last year.    Economists say the problems of high inflation and excess liquidity are likely to remain problems so long as Beijing's policies remain unfocused. For example, just six months ago, Communist Party General-Secretary Zhao Ziyang unveiled a grandiose coastal-development plan that calls for huge investment. Yet at about the same time, Beijing ordered a nationwide austerity drive.    So far, the central bank has missed almost every government monetary target for the first half by a wide margin. The bank is learning that conventional controls are no longer working as the economy loosens up.    The 1988 quota for so-called infrastructural loans, for instance, is likely to be exceeded by 100%, according to Zhang Enzhao, president of the Shanghai branch of the People's Construction Bank of China. &quot;Our banking system has learnt from the West the part about liberalizing, but not the part about self-regulation,&quot; he says.    Given a free hand, economists say, the central bank could have reined in loan demands simply by raising interest rates. Mr. Luo, the central bank official, says rates might eventually go up -- but only gradually.    Economists say there aren't any obvious solutions to China's financial problems. Even normally confident Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, the architect of the country's economic-reform program, seems unsure of the next step. &quot;China is a big laboratory,&quot; he told a North Korean official a few weeks ago. &quot;We face new issues and problems every day.&quot;    Mr. Deng added: &quot;We understand perfectly that every step we take in our price reform is fraught with perils.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
