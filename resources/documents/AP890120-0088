(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A predawn arson fire engulfed an EastSide house today, killing six people and injuring two others,authorities said. Three children were among the dead.   Four other people escaped without injury as the fire spreadexplosively through a 2{-story, wood-frame house, Fire Departmentspokesman Harold Knabe said.   Police Sgt. Greg Mills said the deaths were being investigated ashomicides. No motive has been established.   The fire was the second major arson fire in the city in less thantwo months. Six firefighters were killed Nov. 29 at a constructionsite explosion that investigators said was triggered by arson.   ``Investigators believe something was thrown through a livingroom window on the first floor and spread quickly up a stairwell,''Knabe said of today's fire. The victims were all found on the secondfloor of the house. None was immediately identified.   The two injured people, one of whom jumped from a second-floorwindow, were taken to unidentified hospitals.   Investigators were looking into the possibility that gasoline wasused, Knabe said. Traces of gasoline were found in the living roomand a five-gallon gas can was found on the porch with some residueinside.   ``There were reports (from survivors) that something went throughthe front window,'' he said. The survivors told authorities that thehouse burst into flames suddenly after 3 a.m.   Authorities said the victims were members of two relatedfamilies, and ranged in age from 8 months to 79 years. Knabe saidsome of the people in the house were visiting relatives.   Battalion Fire Chief Bobby Davis said he immediately suspectedarson because ``it (the fire) just took off too quick.'' Accordingto Knabe, ``every inch of the structure was on fire when firemenarrived.''   The fire destroyed about 60 percent of the house but wasprevented from spreading to other structures in the residentialarea, Knabe said.</TEXT></DOC>
