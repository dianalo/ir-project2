On Thursday, soldiers in gas masks broke up a meeting of the Fijian parliament, marched off with the recently elected prime minister, Timoci Bavadra, and seized control. One report yesterday said the coup leaders were sworn in as a government by the island's governor general, the representative of the Fijian queen, Elizabeth II.    A coup on a small South Sea Island hardly seems something that should ring international alarm bells. The Fijian soldiers who seized power are pro-Western, whereas Mr. Bavadra was not. But neighboring Australia and New Zealand are properly deploring the military's assault on democracy. Whether they will take military action remains to be seen. One report last night placed a New Zealand warship in the harbor of the Fijian capital of Suva, and New Zealand troops are on standby.    The strife on Fiji commands more attention when you learn that it occurs against a backdrop of growing political agitation in small Pacific nations and that Libyans -- the advance men for Soviet &quot;friendship&quot; overtures -- seem to be playing a key role in stirring up trouble. While Fiji's coup appears largely home-grown, it springs from precisely the kind of ethnic strife that lends itself to such exploitation.    Australia and New Zealand, assuming that they would prefer not to be surrounded by outposts of the Russian empire, might have to face up to some greater responsibilities for the peace of the region. Right now the ANZUS defense treaty remains beached in New Zealand's nuclear-free zone. Australia -- to its credit -- has stuck by the treaty, but it allows a Libyan People's Bureau to operate out of Sydney. In a bid to stop French nuclear testing in French Polynesia, which just happens to be nearly 3,000 miles away, both countries recently declared the entire vast South Pacific a &quot;nuclear-free zone.&quot; Such policies don't discourage penetration by the Soviets and Libyans into the region.    The fear for Fiji now is that its crisis could turn into the kind of &quot;ethnic&quot; conflict that the Soviets are fanning in Sri Lanka. Indigenous Fijians and ethnic Indians each make up about half the total population of 715,000. Since its independence from Britain in 1970 through this April, Fiji was ruled by the pro-Western Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, a Fijian. In last month's elections, Mr. Mara lost to the anti-Western Mr. Bavadra, who has denounced both American aid and visits by U.S. warships to Fiji and whose cabinet tilted heavily toward ethnic Indians. The coup leader, Lt. Col. Sitiveni Rabuka, installed the pro-Western Mr. Mara as the foreign minister in his new cabinet.    The Soviets and Libyans are recruiting elsewhere in the Pacific. They are operating in the Philippines, where a shooting war is in progress. In French New Caledonia, Melanesian separatists go to Libya for training. Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke has glossed over these connections in his urgings that the New Caledonians be handed independence -- something it's not clear the majority wants. France will allow a referendum on the question this summer.    The Soviets signed a fishing treaty with the island nation of Kiribati then dropped it for a better deal with Vanuatu early this year, getting landing rights as well. Some dozen Vanuatuans have received weapons instruction in Libya, and plans are to send more for &quot;police training.&quot;    Australia and New Zealand may be slowly awakening to what is going on around them. On May 1, Australian Foreign Minister Bill Hayden flew to New Zealand to talk over the Libyan problem with Prime Minister David Lange. A good first step would be for New Zealand to drop its &quot;nuclear-free&quot; zone rhetoric, which is patently ridiculous when you consider the Soviet nuclear-armed submarines prowling the waters of the world, and again take up its abandoned role in the ANZUS pact. A good second step would be for Australia to expel the Libyan People's Bureau that now serves as a relay station for South Pacific agitators. It might even be time for the U.S. to call loud and clear for all its Asian and Pacific allies to sit down and consider what, if anything, Pacific nations propose to do to counter the expanding Soviet naval power that projects outward from Vladivostok and Cam Ranh Bay.    Australia and New Zealand, the two most militarily significant countries of the South Pacific, had their origins in the games of empire of another century. It would be easy to assume that in 1987 those games are finished, and that for Fiji the sole concern is restoration of its lost democracy. But if that is the case, why are Libyan recruiters plying their trade on South Seas islands? </TEXT></DOC>
