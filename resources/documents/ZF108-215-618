(product enhancement).andO;Ticker:    IBM.andO;Product:   ExpEDIte/MVS Host (Computer terminal emulator) (productintroduction).andO;Topic:     Micro-Mainframe CommunicationSNAData Communications.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>IBM AnnouncementsandM;Expedite/MVS is enhanced and its new name reflects its provenanceExpedite/MVS Host is a host interface licensed program that can be installedin an SNA host processor to communicate with the IBM Information Network'sInformation Exchange service.andP;  Release 3.0, a member of the ExpediteCommunicator series, supports the functions of Information Exchange Release3.0, including international messaging, permanent alias tables, permanentdistribution lists, audit reports, and address validation.andP;  Expedite/MVS Hostis the new version of the licensed program previously known as SNA HostInformation Exchange Interface.andP;  IBM says that the new name will more clearlyidentify the program as a member of the IBM Expedite Communicator series ofinterface products.andM;Ada compilers for the 370 development systemandM;get new functionalityandM;IBM's Development System for the Ada Language System/370 Compilers Version 2Release 1 Modification 2 are validated to Level 1.10 of the ACVC and havebeen functionally enhanced.andP;  Performance enhancements include improvedtasking execution time, and improved compiler and binder throughput for theMVS Compiler.andP;  A number of new functions have also been announced includingan interface to the Graphical Data Display Manager.andP;  The interface providesan Ada binding to GDDM, enabling users to call GDDM procedures from an Adaprogram.andP;  Ada MVS Compiler and the Ada MVS Run Time Library will now run inthe MVS/ESA environment Version 3 for JES2 and JES3.andP;  The Ada binding to GDDMwill operate with GDDM Version 2 Release 2.andP;  To bind with the VM Ada productsuse GDDM/VM and GDDM/VMXA, and GDDM/MVS to bind with the MVS Ada products.andO;The planned availability date is February 2, 1990.andP;  For groups 10 to 60, theAda Compiler under VM/CMS costs between $18,560 and $207,650.andP;  Monthlylicences start at $619 and go up to $3,845.andP;  The VM/CMS Ada run-time libraryfor Groups 10 to 60 costs between $1,855 and $20,840.andP;  Monthly licences arefrom $63 to $386.andP;  The MVS Ada compiler for groups 10 to 60 cost between$81,960 and $207,650.andP;  Monthly licences start at $1,705 and go up to $3,845.andO;The MVS Run-Time library, groups 18 to 60, costs between $8,195 and $20,840.andO;Monthly licences start at $173 and go up to $386.andP;  The VM to MVS Ada CrossCompiler, groups 10 to 60, start at $18,560 and increase to $207,650 forgroup 60.andP;  Monthly licences are between $619 and $3,845.andM;IBM slashes the cost of accelerating the 2440 Tape SubsystemandM;IBM has slashed the price of the accelerator for the 2440 Magnetic TapeSubsystem, the Field Installed High-Speed Feature.andP;  It costs $2,990, downfrom the old price of $5,995.andM;IBM enhances its geoManager applicationandM;IBM says that the geoManager application has new and enhanced functions forGFIS users.andP;  It provides a relational implementation of the GFIS databasebuilt on the DB2 and SQL/DS database products, and also provides graphicquery capability for 3270 terminals.andP;  The application allows the GFISgeofacility database to be contained in sets of relational tables, using DB2in MVS or SQL/DS in VM environments as the Database Management System.andO;Compatibility is maintained with a Graphics Program Generator and InterfaceFormat File definitions.andP;  Current IFF data will be supported.andP;  Graphic updateis by the graphics program generator only.andP;  Database creation and maintenancefunctions are provided for additions, modifications, deletions, andreplacement.andP;  Area and network retrievals are provided, and IBM claims thatthe ability to qualify area retrievals is more flexible than in the currentprogram offering.andP;  Once the area is defined, specific qualifications can begiven to determine what data within the area should be retrieved, andqualifications can be made on entity type and attribute data fields.andP;  Theapplication supports retrieval of facility data even if the facility is onlypartially within the geographic area being retrieved.andP;  The geoManagerapplication has predefined dialogue screen panels and user access supportroutines that generate the geoManager requests from data submitted in thedialogue screen panel.andP;  A new open format capability, in output mode only,provides a greater degree of flexibility for accessing geo-facility data.andO;This, says IBM, will eliminate the retrieval of data that is only of interestto graphics program generator when a application makes an inquiry.andP;  Dataassociated with pending work orders is stored as part of the database, andpending work data can be retrieved through standard retrieval operations.andP;  Inaddition to the retrievals to IFF and open format, data can be retrieved foruse with geoManager graphic support on 3270 Display graphic terminals.andO;Available from June 29, on Model groups 20 to 60 it will be from $28,100 and$193,400.andP;  Monthly licences start at $1,169 and go to $4,297.andM;Goldmedal office system for AIX usersandM;IBM has picked up Goldmedal from Decathlon Data Systems Inc for AIX usersunder its Cooperative Software Program.andP;  It includes a compound document wordprocessor, three-dimensional spreadsheet, relational database, communicationswith electronic mail, presentation graphics, and desktools.andP;  Other featuresinclude context-sensitive help, natural language commands, interfaces, pop-upmenus, and user-defined custom keys.andP;  It runs on the PS/2 and RT under AIX.andO;For one to four users it's $1,495, for five to eight, $3,200, nine to 16users pay $6,400, 17 to 32, $11,200, 33 to 48, $16,800, 49 to 64, $22,400, 65to 96, $32,640.andP;
