NURSING HOME ACCUSED OF ENDANGERINGLIVES  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Investigators portrayed Skyline as a place where patients were sometimesyelled at, dressed in shabby clothing and made to lie in threadbare bedclothesthat often weren't changed after they had soiled themselves. Reports told ofpeople in tears because they couldn't get anyone to take them to the bathroom,their call lights unanswered for up to an hour.;    On one Sunday morning, aninvestigator walked through the facility and found 12 patients with theirdentures out of reach. Some of the teeth were dirty and their containers hadblack mold or debris in them.;    The district licensing office in San Josehas recommended to the federal Health Care Financing Administration thatSkyline's participation in the Medi-Cal and Medicare programs be terminated.If that occurs, the nursing home would lose payment for the care of itsMedicare and Medi-Cal patients.;    Skyline is owned by ARA LivingCenters-Pacific Inc., a subsidiary of the food service conglomerate ARAServices Inc. Earlier this year, the health department took action to revokethe license of another San Jose ARA nursing facility, Winchester LivingCenter, because of that home's poor record of care over the past seven years.That action is still pending.;    Bertha Stone, a supervisor in the districtlicensing office, said Skyline has since corrected all of the conditions thatled to the citations. The state will conduct a follow-up inspection before themiddle of June.;    In a written statement, ARA responded to the allegationsby saying Skyline is conducting an internal quality assurance review to assessthe state report. &quot;Meeting individual resident needs and providing consistentquality care will remain our top priority,&quot; the statement said.;    The greatmajority of citations against Skyline resulted from the state's intensiveinvestigation in early April. In one instance, a 95-year-old woman fell andbroke her leg, the bone protruding through a tear in the skin. When paramedicsarrived at the San Jose nursing home, she was in shock.;    &quot;The nurse told methe patient fell an hour and a half ago and she did not think the woman neededan ambulance -- that she was going to try to fix it herself,&quot; an ambulanceattendant told a state health official. The nurse then notified the woman'sdoctor, who ordered an ambulance. The nurse delayed another 55 minutes beforemaking the call.;    In another incident, a 74-year-old woman recovering froma fractured right hip broke her left hip when a nurse's aide tried to move herout of her bed alone and she fell out of the aide's grasp onto the floor. Theaccident happened April 1. Her physician was notified April 3.;    In anothercase, an 84-year-old man, who was identified by the home as likely to fall ifleft unattended, fell three times over a 16-day period and subsequentlyrequired major surgery for a fractured hip.;    In each of these cases, thefacility was cited for failing to develop a plan of care that would protectthe patients.;    During its investigation, the state team found a 79-year-oldwoman unresponsive and apparently in a medical crisis. When they brought thesituation to the attention of nurses, investigators said, they were told thepatient was simply &quot;relaxing after her morning shower.&quot;;    Only afterinvestigators insisted, evaluator Marian Cromartie said, did the nursing staffcheck the woman's condition and transfer her to an acute-care hospital.;   Cromartie said the woman was being given two potent drugs -- &quot;a significantmedication error&quot; -- although her doctor had discontinued one of them twoweeks earlier. The staff also apparently failed to recognize the woman'sdeteriorating condition even though blood studies showed abnormalities, thestate charged.;    &quot;The kinds of problems we found show a real lack ofsensitivity to patient rights and dignity,&quot; said Carla Framiglio, districtadministrator in San Jose, &quot;and they can lead to serious problems.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ED POPE, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910517  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  702  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday May 17, 199100138073,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
