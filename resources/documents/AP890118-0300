The Micro A further blurs the distinction between personalcomputers and mainframes, which were once as different asmotorcycles and buses. It can can run either standard personalcomputer programs or programs written for its big A series ofmainframes, Unisys said.   Unisys used advanced chip-packing techniques to get mainframefeatures onto a board small enough to fit into a single slot in oneof its standard PW2 personal computers.   The Micro A should help Unisys against competitors such asInternational Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp.,which are also emphasizing their ability to run the same programs onbig and small computers, analysts said.   ``I think they've got something real here,'' said WendyAbramowitz, an analyst for Argus Research Corp. But she said Unisys'A series would still have trouble competing with the likes of IBM'snew AS-400 line because there are fewer programs available for it.   ``It's a positive but it's not a cure-all,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
