On Thursday, researchers said measurements of historical levelsof radioactive carbon in the remote California lake suggest thatnuclear waste may have been secretly dumped there in the 1950s andperhaps again in the 1970s.   ``We think radiocarbon had to be added to that lake in largequantities,'' said Wallace Broecker of Columbia University'sLamont-Doherty Geological Observatory in Palisades, N.Y.   His study is in the current issue of Earth and Planetary ScienceLetters.   Davis calls the finding ``a question of public policy ... howwell we're handling our waste.''   The researchers used various techniques to rule out otherpossible sources of radioactive carbon, such as atmospheric testingof atomic bombs. ``Increases found in other nearby lakes and in theocean can be attributed to the bomb testing, but Mono Lake'sincrease is far too great for that,'' Broecker said in a telephoneinterview.   Mono Lake is one of the nation's most important birdsanctuaries, a scenic wonder that attracts millions of birds andhundreds of thousands of human visitors each year, Davis said. Shesaid the birds either make their homes there or use the lake as away station during migrations. It is dotted with strange columns oftufa, a limestone rock built up from calcium deposited by the lake.   The principal threat to the lake is the diversion of waterupstream to supply Los Angeles. The radioactive dumping thatBroecker and his colleagues think is likely to have taken placeposes no threat to humans or wildlife at the lake, Broecker said.The radiation levels are too low.   Residents of Los Angeles drink water from streams supplying thelake, not from the lake itself, which is extremely salty.   The lake's levels of the radioactive form of carbon known ascarbon-14 have increased by 60 percent since the mid-1950s,Broecker said _ about four times more than would have been expectedfrom fallout from atomic bomb tests.   The radioactive waste that Broecker thinks was dumped therecould have come from radioactive samples used in medicine, fromnuclear reactors or from nuclear weapons research, Broecker said.   ``In the 1950s, people had lots of these things, and what werethey doing with them? We know what they were doing with chemicalwastes _ they were stashing them any place they could,'' Broeckersaid.   Broecker is a geochemist. His study was intended to examine theexchange rate of gases, such as carbon dioxide, back and forthbetween the lake and the atmosphere.   Karl Turekian, chairman of the department of geology at YaleUniversity and editor of the journal in which the study appears,said Broecker's suggestion that radioactive waste was dumped in thelake ``is a very reasonable speculation.''   Broecker's study involved measurement of ordinary carbon and ofcarbon-14, among many other observations. Similar measurements weremade at Pyramid Lake and Walker Lake in Nevada, which are in somerespects similar to Mono Lake.   ``Mono Lake puzzled us because it gave a really aberrantresult,'' Broecker said.   Broecker and his colleagues, including Scott Stine, apost-doctoral fellow at Lamont-Doherty, found that they couldreconstruct historical levels of carbon-14 in the lake by measuringthe carbon-14 deposited along its shoreline.   Each year the lake has shrunk in size and leaves deposits ofcalcium carbonate on a new shoreline. Those shorelines record theshrinking of the lake the way tree rings record a tree's growth.Samples can be taken from various dated shorelines and used toprovide a record of the carbon content of the lake at that time,Broecker said.   The carbon-14 levels jumped between 1952 and 1958, and again, bya smaller amount, between 1966 and 1977, Broecker said. The laterincrease could represent a second dumping of radioactive waste, orit could be the result of corrosion of canisters of waste dumped inthe 1950s, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
