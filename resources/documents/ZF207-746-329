(Survivable Adaptive PlanningExperiment)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Anthes, Gary H.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The Department of Defense is about to award a contract for theSurvivable Adaptive Planning Experiment (SAPE), a prototypenuclear-weapons targeting system that would identify targets,allocate weapons, and specify delivery timing and modes.andP;  Thegoals of SAPE are to reduce planning-cycle time from 18 months tothree days, drastically reduce personnel requirements, andincrease system survivability tenfold.andP;  SAPE is geared to enablingrapid adaptation before and during a nuclear conflict whileavoiding damage.andP;  It specifies the ability to change 600 targetsper day at a rate of one target change every three minutes.andP;  Thecornerstones of SAPE are powerful hardware, smart software usingartificial-intelligence techniques and mathematical algorithms,and a high-speed communications network.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     United States.
