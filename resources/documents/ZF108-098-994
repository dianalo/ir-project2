said Arthur Goulet, a systems analyst at the NationalCancer Institute.andM;&quot;If it isn't easy to use, then what's the use of having a computer?&quot; heasked.andP;  &quot;If the intervention of a computer between the user and the writtenpage hasn't made things easier for the user, then the software and hardwarehasn't served you.&quot;andM;Using 11 product attributes as a basis, more than 500 corporate respondentsrated seven word processors that had been used within their organizations forat least three months.andP;  Overall scores were then calculated for each product,based on its individual attribute scores.andM;Professional Write 2.1, from Software Publishing Corp. of Mountain View,Calif., walked away with most of the top honors, capturing the highestoverall score of 78 points out of 100 and first-place scores in the fourhighest-rated attributes.andM;Not far behind, Ami 1.0B, from Samna Corp. of Atlanta, and Qandamp;A Write 1.01,from Symantec Corp. of Cupertino, Calif., tied for second place overall, at76 points.andP;  Next, with identical scores of 73, were Sprint 1.01, from BorlandInternational Inc. of Scotts Valley, Calif., and PC-Write 3.02, fromQuicksoft Inc. of Seattle.andM;Fully five points later came Volkswriter 4, from Volkswriter Inc. ofMonterey, Calif., with an overall score of 68.andP;  DisplayWrite Assistant, fromIBM of Armonk, N.Y., had the lowest overall score, with 59 points from itsbuyers.andM;Clearly, corporate buyers want their word processors to load and runflawlessly: They selected overall reliability as the most importantattribute, with a score of 91.andM;Poll respondents also want their word processor's user interface to be easyto negotiate.andP;  They named ease of use of the user interface as the secondmost important attribute, giving it a score of 89.andM;While reliability is more crucial than power and performance, a product'sspeed remains important, according to buyers, who placed overall performancethird, with a score of 88.andM;Clarity of documentation received the fourth-highest score of 84, whilecompleteness and organization of documentation followed with 82 points.andM;Professional Write drew first- or second-highest finishes in eight of the 11attributes, and received the highest scores in the four top-rated attributes:reliability (87), ease of use of the user interface (89), performance (84)and clarity of documentation (79).andM;&quot;Professional Write's user interface is very intuitive for beginning users,&quot;said Karen Dobel, senior staff analyst at oil company Conoco Inc.andM;Professional Write also won top honors in completeness and organization ofdocumentation, tying with Qandamp;A Write and Sprint, with a score of 78.andM;Samna's Windows-based Ami, which tied with Qandamp;A Write for the second-highestoverall score, was cited by its buyers as tops in text-formattingflexibility, with 81 points.andP;  Ami also achieved highest honors inlowest-rated support accessibility, with a score of 70.andM;In addition, its second-highest placement in ease of use of the userinterface (87) was only two points less than top-scoring Professional Writeand an impressive 10 points higher than any of the other products' scores.andM;Qandamp;A Write drew higher scores than Ami from their respective buyers inreliability and performance, scoring four points higher in reliability andnine points higher in performance.andP;  These finishes were offset, however, byAmi's 10-point jump in ease of use of the user interface: Qandamp;A Write's buyersgave that product only 77 points for that attribute.andM;Sprint and PC-Write tied for third in overall points, with 73.andP;  While Sprintreceived a top score (78) in completeness and organization of documentation,its buyers' scores relegated it to third and fourth places in most of theother attributes.andM;With its low-cost shareware origins, PC-Write garnered top accolades inrelative value, with a score of 87.andP;  In overall reliability, PC-Write tiedfor second, with a score of 82.andP;  However, Poll results show that buyers werenot impressed with its user interface, giving ease of use the next-to-lowestscore of 68.andM;Volkswriter 4's overall score of 68--five points lower than PC-Write andSprint, and 10 points less than top-scoring Professional Write 2.1--can beattributed to its low scores in most attributes.andM;For example, it placed next to last in both reliability and ease of use ofthe user interface, with scores of 72 and 69, respectively.andM;&quot;Volkswriter means 'people writer,'&quot; said Goulet, of the National CancerInstitute, &quot;but it's outside the mainstream of products.andP;  The vendor took aturn toward a niche market when they went for the statistical editingmarket.&quot;andM;The high-water mark for Volkswriter 4 was a fourth-place tie with Sprint inclarity of documentation.andM;Volkswriter 4's overall finish, however, was still nine points higher thanthat of IBM's DisplayWrite Assistant, which received an overall score of59--a whopping 19 points below Professional Write.andM;In fact, buyers of IBM's DisplayWrite Assistant placed it last in everycategory.andP;  The largest gap occurred in value relative to cost, whereDisplayWrite Assistant drew a 52 from its purchasers, 17 points below itsnearest rival and 35 points below the highest score in that category.andM;Some buyers focused particular attention on DisplayWrite Assistant'sreliability and IBM's support for it.andM;Installing and supporting DisplayWrite Assistant is &quot;not a good experience,&quot;Conoco's Dobel said.andP;  &quot;Users have had problems with lost data files,corrupted data files and difficulty in printer support.&quot;andM;Packages Withdrawn from Poll ResultsandM;Survey data on sixteen additional packages originally intended for inclusionin this week's PC Week Poll of Corporate satisfaction results have beenwithdrawn from publication for failing to elicit the Poll's required minimumof 25 buyers.andM;The vendors of Bank Street Writer Plus 1.1 (Broderbund Software Inc.),andO;MindReader 2.0 (Brown Bag Software Inc.), PC-Type II 1.0 (Buttonware Inc.),andO;Final Draft 3.2 (CYMA Division of Worldwide Tech Inc.), DacEasy Word 3.0(DacEasy Inc.), Friendly Writer 3.4 (Friendlysoft Inc.), Celebrity Write 2.0(Good Software Corp.), The QWERTY Word Processor 6A (HFK Software), PalantirWord Processor 3.01 (Palantir Inc.), Win Tex 1.54 (Palantir Inc.), R. Word4.1.0 (R Systems Inc.), CrystalWriter Plus 4.1 (Syntatics Corp.), VarsityScripsit 1.0 (Tandy Corp.) and ZenWord 4.0 (Wesson International) declined toprovide PC Week with a mailing list of at least 150 corporate customers,together with a signed agreement not to contact these customers regardingthis survey.andP;  Our mailing failed to elicit the Poll's required minimum of 25buyers.andM;Despite the fact that they did provide a mailing list, Textra 5.2 (Ann ArborSoftware Inc.) and Galaxy 2.43 (Omniverse Software Corp.) were withdrawn fromthe Poll because we found differences of statistical significance favoringthose products from respondents supplied by their manufacturers, and removingthose respondents brought the total number of respondents on that product toless than 25.andM;SURVEY METHODOLOGYandM;The PC Week Poll of Corporate Satisfaction is designed to provide corporatebuyers of microcomputer products with quantitative information about whichproduct attributes matter most to other buyers.andP;  Using such attributes as afocus, each Poll attempts to measure buyer satisfaction with a group ofproducts in a particular category.andM;It's important to note that these Polls are not intended to provide orreplace benchmark-type data (best obtained from conventional product reviews)or specification-sheet data (best obtained from comprehensive buyers'guides).andM;Rather, PC Week Polls strive to gather data on corporate satisfaction withthose product characteristics that cannot be measured by benchmark tests orfound in product-specification sheets, particularly those related to aproduct's ability to function in real-life workplaces.andM;Product categories are surveyed in clusters to take advantage of likelyoverlap in product usage by respondents.andP;  Each Poll focuses on a limitednumber of brands in a product category, including market leaders and otherbrands selected as noteworthy by PC Week's editorial staff.andM;Respondents ratings of a given brand are based on a series of productattributes related to that product category.andP;  In addition to rating productson the basis of these attributes, respondents are asked to rate theimportance of the attributes as they generally relate to that productcategory.andM;Survey mailing lists for each product group are obtained from both the PCWeek subscriber file and vendor lists.andP;  Subscriber lists (with at least 1,000names per product category) are drawn on an nth-name basis from among thosesubscribers self-identified as having purchase involvement with the productcategory being surveyed.andM;For each brand initially selected for inclusion in a survey, its manufactureris requested, via certified letter, to supply PC Week with a random list of150 to 250 corporate or institutional customers who have purchased thatproduct at least five months earlier.andP;  Vendors are also required to submit toPC Week a formal, written certification that they will not contact thesecustomers regarding the survey.andM;For data on a specific brand to be reported in a Poll, completedquestionnaires concerning it must be received from a minimum of 25 qualifiedrespondents.andP;  These respondents can be either PC Week subscribers orvendor-provided corporate customers, with the latter accounting for a maximumof 70 percent of the respondents for each brand.andM;For any surveyed brand whose vendor supplies a mailing list to PC Week, ourresearch department compares the average final scores awarded to that brandby vendor-supplied respondents with the average final scores awarded by PCWeek subscribers.andP;  Where differences of statistical significance favoring abrand are found to have been awarded by respondents whose names were suppliedby the vendor, only non-vendor data will be used to calculate that brand'sscores, provided PC Week has received data from at least 25 non-vendorrespondents.andM;If PC Week does not have data from at least 25 non-vendor respondents, thescores for that product are withdrawn from publication.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
