Financial centers in Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C. High-tech meccas in Raleigh, N.C., and Huntsville, Ala. Auto plants rising outside Nashville, Tenn., and Lexington, Ky.    But the progress of the metropolitan South masks problems that cut a wide swath through the region.    &quot;The sunshine on the Sun Belt has proved to be a narrow beam of light,&quot; says the Southern Growth Policies Board, &quot;brightening futures along the Atlantic Seaboard and in large cities, but skipping over many small towns and rural areas.&quot;    Mississippi's economy is &quot;Third World,&quot; Ray Mabus, its new governor, says. A Hertford County, N.C., newspaper publisher, Joe M. Parker, calls his coastal region &quot;the Bangladesh of North Carolina.&quot; The widening gap between Atlanta's economy and the surrounding state has spawned a &quot;Two Georgias&quot; issue.    Some people are trying to spotlight such issues as the region's &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; presidential primary, on March 8, draws near. In a briefing paper for the candidates called &quot;What Y'all Ought to Know,&quot; a group of the region's economic experts describes the lagging rural areas as &quot;clearly the South's No. 1 problem, threatening to become a permanent anchor on the general prosperity and development of the Sun Belt.&quot;    No presidential candidate has yet seized upon the issue, however, and it could be argued that the rural South's fortunes have improved recently. The Tennessee Valley Authority says rural areas in its seven-state territory reported a 5.1% increase in jobs from July 1986 to July 1987, against a 1.9% gain for the cities. That reverses the pattern of the previous six years, when cities' employment grew 17.3% and the countryside's only 1.7%.    But Allan G. Pulsipher, the TVA's chief economist, says the change mainly reflects the weak dollar, which has -- probably only temporarily -- helped manufacturers raise exports and has stemmed imports. &quot;It looks like somewhat of a one-shot deal and not a reversal of the long-term trend,&quot; he says. &quot;It's still a serious problem.&quot;    It is especially serious because the South is the nation's most rural region, with about 37% of its people living in the countryside, compared with 23% in the rest of the U.S. Moreover, the rural South's problems will eventually afflict the metropolitan South. The rural dispossessed aren't expected to head North, as they once did; now, they are likely to crowd into nearby cities, which will be as ill-equipped to handle them as Northern ghettos were.    The shadows in the Sun Belt are cast by more than a century of history. Even after the slaves were freed and the Civil War ended, planters dominated the South. Its development was guided by their values: low wages, skimpy education and little government. For years, those characteristics were used to attract industry. An industrial base of branch plants made the South an economic colony, but, writes historian James C. Cobb, that strategy was &quot;intertwined with other traditions like white supremacy, minimal government and regional chauvinism.&quot;    In the past decade, however, the old lures have lost their drawing power. Manufacturers discovered even cheaper labor in Asia. They computerized their U.S. plants, and functional illiterates no longer made good employees. Moreover, traditional manufacturers became less important than purveyors of high-tech products and high-tech services, which also favored the educated and the cities.    Southern cities that adjusted to such trends most successfully, set aside Jim Crow fastest and threw open their arms widest have emerged as the Sun Belt's stars. They combine old-style Southern advantages such as moderate costs and temperate climate with new-style necessities such as top-flight airports.    North Carolina illustrates the South's stark contrasts. The state has one of the nation's Information Age citadels, the Research Triangle Park of Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill. It is a major Industrial Age remnant, with 30% of its work force still in manufacturing. It has a booming services-oriented city -- Charlotte -- that voted out a mayor who failed to deal with the congestion caused by growth.    But it also has a struggling textile-producing county -- Richmond -- that would love a good traffic jam. While employment in Mecklenburg County, in which Charlotte is situated, soared 29% from 1980 through November 1987, Richmond County, just 80 miles east, was gaining only 5%.    That pattern of bifurcated fortunes is repeated all over North Carolina. The state's employment has grown 23% during the decade, but that has included both a 47% surge in Wake County, where Raleigh is, and a 12% loss in Graham County amid Appalachian poverty. The areas that lost out are mostly rural and dependent on manufacturing.    Richmond County is both. As recently as the mid-1970s, it had high hopes. Clark Equipment Co. built a transmission plant employing more than 1,000 people and providing some diversification away from textiles. But in 1986, Clark, in a consolidation move, closed the facility -- a major blow.    The facility has been taken over by an underwear maker, and, surprisingly, many Richmond County textile mills are humming these days. North Carolina, which lost 47,000 textile jobs from 1980 to 1985, has regained more than 15,000 of them in the past two years. But the Richmond County textile jobs pay less than the Clark jobs did, and the mills' payrolls could dwindle quickly if the dollar -- and the import threat -- revives. Meanwhile, the county isn't getting the modern plants with better chances of survival.    That's because it doesn't have the educated work force needed to run them. About one-third of Richmond County's adults have an eighth-grade education or less, according to the 1980 census. &quot;For years, the attitude was 'I can get a job without the education,' and that attitude went through generations,&quot; says Prentice Taylor, the chairman of the Richmond County Commissioners. &quot;But that's not nearly enough now. You need some skills in the computer world we're in.&quot;    Richmond Technical College, a two-year school here, is building a &quot;computer technologies center&quot; to instill such skills and, it hopes, attract industry. Former North Carolina Gov. James Hunt is spearheading a project designed to attract Triangle-related manufacturers to the eastern part of the state. And the state has created the North Carolina Rural Economic Development Center, which is trying to drum up jobs for the backwaters.    But the elite of Richmond County -- and of places like it -- aren't united on such matters. The old system gave them their fortunes and their power, and change isn't necessarily in their interest.    &quot;A person making $7.50 an hour here is doing better than somebody making $10 an hour in the city,&quot; says R.W. Goodman, the county's politically powerful sheriff, who also owns a textile mill and a department store. &quot;As long as Charlotte's going good, I don't mind being in the backwater. There's too much hustle and bustle there.&quot;    Indeed there is. While Richmond is hurt by its isolation from markets, Charlotte, at the juncture of two interstate highways, has become a major distribution center. And as a Piedmont Airlines hub, it has attracted corporate regional offices.    But its most important businesses are two local banks, NCNB Corp. and First Union Corp. By aggressively gathering deposits from its growing population and lending to its growing businesses, both have made the list of the nation's top 25 banks. They have given Charlotte the nucleus of a financial-services center, which has lured companies such as Royal Insurance Co. away from New York.    That all adds up to a patina of sophistication. &quot;We've reached the point where there's enough culture and diversity of people that CEOs can talk their wives into moving here,&quot; says Henry Faison, a local real-estate developer.    Charlotte also benefits from its progressive race relations. While some cities permanently hurt themselves during the 1960s civil-rights campaigns, Charlotte's mayor and chamber of commerce president defused tensions by taking black guests to once-segregated restaurants. While some cities have fought integrated schools to the death, Charlotte has had a peaceful busing program for more than a decade. And in 1983, the city, though only 30% black, elected a black mayor, Harvey Gantt. (Last November, he was defeated for re-election.)    By contrast, many areas are still shackled by the past. Northeastern North Carolina had some of the state's biggest plantations, which left it with a large black population of slaves-turned-sharecroppers and a legacy of illiteracy.    Those handicaps weren't so bad when farms and textile mills were prospering. But tobacco is in trouble, and factories are closing. As a result, &quot;one of the area's main exports has been its young people and motivated people,&quot; says Brewster W. Brown, a local state representative. &quot;I go to Raleigh, and it seems like half the people there have ancestral ties here.&quot;    Indeed, the Raleigh-Durham area is drawing North Carolina natives seeking opportunity and companies seeking brainpower. Research Triangle Park is really just high-falutin industrial recruiting, but it caught the high-tech wave and has become a big research and development outpost for the likes of International Business Machines Corp. (10,000 employees) and Northern Telecom (7,500 employees).    What the area is selling is a genteel combination of the nation's highest per-capita concentration of Ph.D.s, among the research facilities and three major universities, in a setting without bigger cities' problems. Says Thomas J. White of the Greater Durham Chamber of Commerce, &quot;Quality of life may be the factor that draws people here. Decision-makers in their 50s and 60s like to be somewhere were they can play golf and buy a nice house for $200,000.&quot;    But the Research Triangle has spawned little work for people cast out of tobacco and textile jobs and fewer than anticipated research-related manufacturing plants. It may symbolize not only the &quot;New South&quot; but also the widening gap between urban and rural, white collar and blue collar.    ---           North Carolina's Growth in Jobs, 1980-87                    Job Changes, by County Urban                          Rural Wake                  +47%     Richmond              + 5% (Raleigh) Mecklenburg           +29%     Hertford             -0.2% (Charlotte) Forsyth               +22%     Graham                -12% (Winston-Salem)   Source: North Carolina Employment Security Commission</TEXT></DOC>
