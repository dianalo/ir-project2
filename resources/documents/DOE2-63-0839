The discharges occurred between tungsten electrodes spaced2.4-8.2 mm apart and were produced by a microsecond high-voltage triggerto cause breakdown, delivering energies on the order of 1 mJ, followedby a low-voltage sustainer of duration variable up to 2 ms, deliveringenergies up to 500 mJ. Of the nine phenomena identified as potentialcontributors to the droplet impulse, when there was no perceptible gapbetween the droplet surface and the initial spark the most importantwas the pressure imposed on one side of the droplet by the initial shock.When a perceptible gap between the initial spark and the droplet surfacewas evident, in addition to this pressure effect, the most importantcontributors to the droplet impulse were the drag caused by the flowbehind the initial shock and by the flow of the cold gas ahead of theexpanding spark kernel. From the simplified theoretical models that weredeveloped and the measurements that were made, these phenomena were foundto produce droplet velocity increments of orders of magnitude rangingfrom 10/sup -3/ to 10/sup 2/ mm/s. The impulses were established to bedue predominantly to the trigger. Electrostatic phenomena were foundto produce comparable velocity increments if the prebreakdown field durationswere sufficiently long or if breakdown did not occur. The results areof use for reducing spark-induced droplet perturbations in design ofexperiments on droplet combustion.</TEXT></DOC>
