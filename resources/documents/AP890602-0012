It appears they were wrong.   The British prime minister and the new American presidentshowered each other with praise at a formal dinner at 10 DowningStreet on Thursday night and regaled the celebrity-studded audiencewith anecdotes.   Bush, on the final night of his first trip to Europe aspresident, stayed a half-hour later than planned, and said beforedriving off, ``It was a wonderful trip.''   Both leaders had the 60 guests at the celebrity-studded,black-tie event in stitches.   Thatcher made a jocular reference to the Bushes' purporteddifficulties with a famous guest at their family compound in Maine.   Mrs. Thatcher recalled that it was from Downing Street thatorders went out to burn the White House in 1814.   ``Well, houses do need a bit of renovation from time to time,''she said. ``But don't worry, we've decided to spare Kennebunkportthe same treatment, ever since we heard that you had to rebuild itanyway for your recent distinguished visitors.''   Mrs. Thatcher was referring to reports, denied by the WhiteHouse, that when French President Francois Mitterrand of Francerecently stayed at the Bush family home in Kennebunkport, Maine, hedemanded a bigger bed and a lower toilet.   Bush paid a warm tribute to another guest, former Prime MinisterSir Alec Douglas-Home, whom he met in New York in 1972 when ``I wasthe new boy on the block ... just out of Congress, representing ourcountry at the United Nations.''   Home, then foreign minister, was at U.N. headquarters onimportant business, while the Bushes were wondering how to whileaway a Sunday afternoon in New York.   ``I said to (Barbara), `I wonder what Sir Alec Douglas-Home isdoing this morning?' She said, `Don't you dare!' And I said `No,I'm going to call him up.'   ``And darn if he didn't say `Yes, I'd love to go out toGreenwich and see the birds'' at the National Audubon Society BirdSanctuary in Connecticut.   ``That marvelous gesture on his part _ of accepting thehospitality of a lowly ambassador, and certainly a new one inforeign affairs _ we've never forgotten it. And I don't knowwhether his wife has forgotten my boosting her across the fenceinto the bird sanctuary,'' the president added.   Mrs. Bush made quite a splash in London.   Thatcher called her ``a marvelous first lady'' and boasted thather husband Denis had ``made a fantastic hit with Barbara.Absolutely terrific, terrific!''   Mrs. Bush made quite a hit with photographers earlier in the daywhen Denis Thatcher greeted her by kissing her hand.   As the media clamored for more, Mrs. Bush plucked DenisThatcher's hand and kissed it.   At the dinner, the president eyed his wife and the primeminister's husband and admonished, ``We don't want anotherfront-page picture.''   ``Indeed, once a day is enough,'' agreed Mrs. Thatcher.   ``I won't kiss your hand again,'' Barbara assured Denis.   The president, an avid sportsman, was clearly pleased with hishost's choice of guests. He swung an imaginary club when golf'sMasters champion, Nick Faldo, came through the receiving line.   And when Thatcher asked, ``Do you know Virginia Wade?'' hereplied, ``I feel as if I do as a tennis fan.''   Later, Bush thanked Thatcher for having ``adequatelyaccommodated my insatiable quest for being the name dropper of theyear by the distinguished guests here.'' Other famous Britons onthe guest list included composer Andrew Lloyd Webber of ``Cats''fame and comedian John Cleese, star of ``A Fish Called Wanda.''</TEXT></DOC>
