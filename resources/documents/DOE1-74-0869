It is the largest known uraniumdeposit with uranium reserves of some 1.2 million tonnes in ore averaging0.06% U, and 1.6% copper. The deposit is in the Middle Proterozoic terrainin a northwest trending graben in an anorogenic A-type granite, and isoverlain by 350 metres of younger sediments. A mineralized area of about30 square kilometres is indicated. The boat-shaped deposit is in a northwesttrending tectonic zone in an extensional continental environment, andwas formed from a large evolving hydrothermal system. Widespread transgressivemineralization was superimposed on earlier stratabound mineralization.(author). 2 refs, 3 figs, 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
