More than two years after the fractious feud over jointdevelopment of the advanced fighter jet, the same potent mixof defense and trade tension is now gumming up Japan'scurrent midterm defense plan. Disagreements are tangling U.S.hopes to sell Japan two new weapons systems, and industryobservers expect more such sniping in the future.</LP><TEXT>   Specifically, Congress is grumbling about Tokyo's threatsto kill one purchase in its defense blueprint -- the AirborneWarning and Control System made by Boeing Co. of Seattle.&quot;The real reason behind all this is the Japanese don't wantto contribute their fair share for their own defense,&quot; saidRep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), sponsor of a resolutionurging Japan to buy the planes. The measure passed the Housein June.   At the same time, the Bush administration is pushing Japanto buy all of its Multiple Launch Rocket Systems from LTVCorp. of Dallas, rather than assigning the bulk of the workto Nissan Motor Co. as planned.   The Awacs and MLRS were originally slated to be the twomajor new pieces of equipment in Japan's 22.75 trillion yen($170 billion) 1991-95 defense plan, which is otherwisenoteworthy for its slowdown in Japan's decade-long rapiddefense buildup. Japan planned to spend an estimated 190billion yen (nearly $1.5 billion) for the equipment over thefive-year period.   While American congressmen, defense officials, and weaponsmakers cast their arguments largely in strategic terms, theyadd that Japan's persistent manufacturing trade surplusshould also be a factor prompting the purchase of moreweapons from the U.S. An Awacs purchase would equal &quot;a hugepercentage of our trade deficit with Japan,&quot; Mr. Schumerwrote in February. &quot;A healthy U.S. defense industry,&quot; said aU.S. government official recently, &quot;is in Japan's nationalinterest.&quot;   Many Japanese bristle at that. Officials at the JapanDefense Agency wouldn't comment. But Seiki Nishihiro, whoretired a year ago as vice minister of the Japan DefenseAgency and still maintains close ties to it, asserts, &quot;Nowthat the Soviet Union is undergoing massive change, we don'thave any strategic justification for introducing Awacs otherthan trade.&quot; He adds: &quot;I don't think it's correct to tietrade and defense.&quot; Mr. Nishihiro also notes that &quot;there'sconcern in America and Asia that Japanese military power isalready too big.&quot; By pushing Japan to buy more Awacs, heasks, &quot;what kind of military do they want us to be?&quot;   U.S. critics, arguing that Japan has thrived economicallybecause the U.S. provided most of its defense, have fornearly two decades asked Japan to increase its military&quot;burden sharing.&quot; But the blurring of economic and defensepolitics became most explicit during the FSX debate in thelate 1980s, in which the Reagan administration persuadedJapan to co-develop a plane Japan wanted to make alone, andwhich Congress then tried to force Japan to buy from the U.S.   Awacs are used to monitor airspace over long ranges,detecting enemy craft and coordinating air attacks. Japan'sinterest in the planes stems from a pledge to the U.S. made10 years ago to gradually take responsibility for defendingthe 1,000 miles surrounding its main islands.   Last year, Japan decided to buy four of the surveillancecraft as part of the current defense plan, and has indicatedit intends to buy a total of 14 in the long term. Even thatdidn't satisfy congressional detractors, who argued thatJapan needed 14 planes in the short term to meet its pledge.But matters got worse when the Pentagon, after the outbreakof hostilities in the Persian Gulf, indefinitely shelvedplans to sell Saudi Arabia 11 Awacs and tankers. That leftBoeing with only the Japan order on the books -- far belowthe quantity needed to keep the aging system alive.   Unable to find other buyers, Boeing and the U.S.government essentially asked Japan either to buy more planesin the next four years or pay twice the price for the fourplanes. As the negotiations dragged on, Boeing in May beganclosing the production line and shifting workers tocommercial operations.   The JDA decided in recent weeks to &quot;delay&quot; for a year anypurchase of airborne early warning systems, and is seekingcheaper alternatives -- a move sources say would effectivelykill the Awacs program. The two sides are still trying towork out a compromise by October, when the Ministry ofFinance officially approves the budget.   A Schumer aide said the congressman is still exploringexactly what avenues he might take to press Japaneseofficials further. &quot;It's time for Japan to stop defending itsindustries and start defending its borders,&quot; Mr. Schumer saidin a statement released in response to questions last week.&quot;If we allow them to proceed with their plans to cancel theAwacs purchase, we will reward Japan's intransigence.&quot;   So far, most of the MLRS skirmishing has taken placebehind the scenes. The systems feature surface-to-surfaceballistic rockets that hold thousands of grenade-likemunitions. Each of the MLRS's 12 rockets has a rangeexceeding 20 miles and can deliver more than two tons offirepower to a target.   The JDA originally wanted Nissan to build 60% of each ofthe 36 systems to be introduced over the next four years,while the U.S. wanted Japan to buy them from LTV. Japan plansto introduce a total of 150 systems over the next decade, andboth sides agree Japan ultimately will produce most of them.   The U.S. has argued that it's important to give much ofthe business to U.S. industry. But Mr. Nishihiro argues thatU.S. defense contractors aren't always reliable in fillinglong-term orders &quot;so if America requires Japan to import thefinal product, we might choose to make it ourselves or buy itfrom other places.&quot;   On this issue as well, the two governments are scramblingfor a compromise.   Meanwhile, the FSX co-development is proceeding, albeitbehind schedule and over budget. The JDA has decided thismonth to request funds necessary to cover the near doublingof the costs. Three weeks ago, Mitsubishi Heavy IndustriesLtd., the main contractor, signed its first major detailedcontracts with General Dynamics Corp. of St. Louis, itsleading American partner, covering $110.7 million of the $800million of business expected between the two companies overthe next five years.</TEXT></DOC>
