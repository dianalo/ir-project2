Prime Minister Brian Mulroney flew to St. John's, Newfoundland,to announce that the federal government will contribute $830million in grants and up to $1.3 billion in loan guarantees for thegiant project.   ``This is a day for rejoicing for the people of Newfoundland andLabrador and an important day for all Canadians,'' Mulroney said.``Hibernia is by far and away the largest capital investment in thehistory of Atlantic Canada.''   He said the project could break the cycle of federal dependencyin Canada's poorest province. ``It means bringing quality jobs intoNewfoundland rather than people moving away from home in search ofwork,'' he said.   But the Conservative prime minister, who is getting ready tocall a general election to seek a second term, acknowledged thatHibernia is a gamble. World oil prices now hovering around $15 abarrel need to pass the $20 mark to make the project pay.   ``If certainty of results and the elimination of risks had beenrequired in advance, (Canada's first prime minister) Sir John A.Macdonald would never have proceeded with the great endeavors whichbound Canada together,'' Mulroney said.   While his faith in the project may win votes in the maritimeprovinces of the East, Mulroney may face questions in other regionsof the country over such a massive expenditure.   Hibernia was discovered in the North Atlantic 185 miles east ofSt. John's in 1979. Falling oil prices and years of arguing betweenthe federal and provincial governments over offshore rights led torepeated delays. The political fight was settled in 1985 whenNewfoundland won the right to offshore royalties.   It will still be six years before construction is completed, andthe project will then have about 20 years of productive life.   The consortium developing the field is led by Mobil Oil CanadaLtd. of Calgary and includes Gulf Canada, Petro-Canada, ChevronCanada Resources Ltd. and Columbia Gas System of Delaware.   The companies demanded concessions from the federal andprovincial governments before signing the agreement, because itwould now cost more to get the oil out of the Atlantic thanrefineries would receive for it.   Hibernia will create 1,100 permanent jobs over its 20 years ofproduction, and about 1,400 jobs during the construction phase.   Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford said it will start aneconomic revival that will give island natives a choice other thanpoverty or emigration.   The province has an unemployment rate of 17 percent, the highestin Canada, and its economy is over-dependent on dwindling fishstocks around its coast.   As part of the deal, construction of the Hibernia drillingplatform will be done entirely in Come-by-Chance, Newfoundland.   The province will waive its 12-percent sales tax on buildingmaterials during the construction phase and reduce it to 4 percentonce Hibernia enters production. Payment of its 16-percentcorporate income tax is open to further negotiation.   The federal government will get 10 percent of net revenues andestimates a return of $1.9 billion to $3.9 billion over two decadesthrough taxes and royalties.   Newfoundland, a co-signer of the agreement, will phase inroyalties starting at 1 percent and projects revenues of $2.1billion to $4.2 billion.   Hibernia is estimated to contain at least 525 million barrels ofoil and should produce an average 110,000 barrels a day during peakproduction, about 7 percent of Canada's projected demand by the endof the century.   Large-scale development in the western provinces made Canadaself-sufficient in oil and natural gas but land-based reserves arerunning low, causing companies to look at offshore reserves in theAtlantic and Arctic as well as the tar sands of Alberta.</TEXT></DOC>
