The petition proposed amending40 CFR Part 180 by establishing a regulation to permit the residues ofthe herbicide bensulfuron methyl ester (methyl-2[[[[[(4-6-dimethoxy-pyrimidin-2-yl)amino]carbonyl]amino]sulfonyl]methyl]benzoate) in or on rice at 0.02 part permillion (ppm). No comments were received in response to the notice of filing.The petitioner subsequently amended the petition by proposing a tolerancefor residues of bensulfuron methyl ester in rice straw at 0.05 ppm.The data submitted in the petition and all other relevant material havebeen evaluated. The pesticide is considered useful for the purpose forwhich the tolerance is sought.The data considered in support of the tolerance include:1. Plant and animal metabolism studies.2. An acute oral rat study with an LD<T2>50</T2> greater than (andgreater;) 5,000 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg)(limit test).3. A 90-day dog feeding study with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of1,000 ppm (32.1 and 36.3 mg/kg/day male/female (M/F)).4. A 90-day mouse feeding study with a NOEL of 1,000 ppm (132 and 133 mg/kg/day,M/F).5. A 90-day rat feeding study with a NOEL of 1,500 ppm (93 and 111 mg/kg/day,M/F).6. A rat teratology study with a developmental NOEL of 1,320 mg/kg/day,the highest dose tested (HDT).7. A rabbit teratology study with a developmental NOEL of 300 mg/kg/day.8. A two-generation rat reproduction study with a reproductive NOEL of7,500 ppm (309 and 405 mg/kg/day, M/F) (HDT).9. A <T3>Salmonella</T3>/Mammalian Activation Assay, negative with and withoutmetoblic activation.10. An <T3>in vivo</T3> bone marrow chromosome study in rats with no evidenceof induced chromosome aberration in bone marrow.11. An <T3>in vitro</T3> sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells with a slightincrease in SCE frequency in nonactivated system at maximum concentration,but negative in the activated system at the same concentration.12. A 1-year dog feeding study with a NOEL of 750 ppm (21.4 and 19.9 mg/kg/day,M/F).13. A 2-year mouse chronic feeding/oncogenicity study with a NOEL of 2,500ppm (226 and 227 mg/kg/day, M/F) for systemic effects and with no oncogenicpotential observed under conditions of the study up to 5,000 ppm (455 and460 mg/kg/day, M/F) (HDT).14. A 2-year rat chronic feeding/oncogenicity study with a NOEL of 750ppm (30 and 40 mg/kg/day, M/F) for systemic effects and with no oncogenicpotential observed under conditions of the study up to 7,500 ppm (309 and405 mg/kg/day, M/F) (HDT).Based on a NOEL of 19.9 mg/kg/day in the 1-year dog feeding study and ahundredfold safety factor, the acceptable daily intake (ADI) has been setat 0.2 mg/kg/day. These tolerances have a theoretical maximum residue contributionof 0.000003 mg/kg/day and would utilize 0.0016 percent of the ADI.There are no regulatory actions pending against the registration of bensulfuronmethyl ester. The metabolism of bensulfuron methyl ester in plants andanimals is adequately understood for purposes of the tolerances set forthbelow. An analytical method, high-pressure liquid chromatography usinga photoconductivity detector, is available for enforcement purposes. Becauseof the long lead time from establishing this tolerance to publication ofthe enforcement methodology in the <T3>Pesticide Analytical Manual</T3>, Vol. II, the analytical methodologyis being made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticideenforcement when requested by mail from:<ITAG tagnum="15">William Grosse, Chief, Information Service Branch, Program Managementand Support Division (TS-767C) Office of Pesticide Programs, EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Office location and telephone number:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Rm. 223, CM andplusmin;2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA22202.</ITAG>There is no expectation of secondary residues in meat, milk, poultry, andeggs. The Agency concludes that the pesticide is considered useful forthe purposes for which the tolerances are sought and that the toleranceswill protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerances are establishedas set forth below.Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days afterpublication of this document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, file written objections with the Hearing Clerk,at the address given above. Such objections should specify the provisionsof the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections.If a hearing is requested, the objections must state the issues for thehearing and the grounds for the objections. A hearing will be granted ifthe objections are supported by grounds legally sufficient to justify therelief sought.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certificationstatement to this effect was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticidesand pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 11, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
