<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-05-1075 </DOCNO><TEXT>In 1982, we collected air sample profiles approximately monthly from aircraftat altitudes up to about 7 km and analyzed them for CO/sub 2/ concentrationand stable isotope composition. The following seasonally detrended meanvalues were obtained per 1 January, 1982: 338 ppm, {delta}/sup 13/C=-7.72permille, {delta}/sup 18/O=-0.6 permille (versus PDB); isotopic resultsare corrected for N/sub 2/O contribution. CO/sub 2/ results are discussedin terms of vertical eddy diffusion and of a mean annual vertical flux.Assuming a two-component mixture between background air and biosphericCO/sub 2/, {delta}/sup 13/C of the biospheric component is -26.2 permille,an good agreement with other northern hemisphere results. {delta}/sup18/O varies seasonally, but with relatively much scatter. The oxygenisotopic composition of CO/sub 2/ is determined by exchange with vegetaion,soils and ocean; these processes are discussed in detail. (authors).</TEXT></DOC>
