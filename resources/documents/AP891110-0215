The British employment-service company's takeover of the muchlarger Manpower, which has its headquarters in Milwaukee, Wis.,created the world's largest temporary employment company.   The charges apparently are related to the investment firm CountyNatwest's failure to properly disclose a 13.4 percent Blue Arrowholding it was left with after a sale of Blue Arrow shares flopped.   County Natwest helped arrange the sale of Blue Arrow shares toexisting Blue Arrow shareholders to finance the takeover ofManpower.   The 10 defendants were charged with conspiracy to defraud andwere to appear before City of London Magistrates Court today,police said. An unspecified number of them were arrested Thursdayand later released.   The City of London is the city's financial district.   The investment firms Natwest Investment Bank Ltd., CountyNatwest Ltd. and UBS Phillips and Drew Securities Ltd. also werecharged with conspiracy to defraud, as well as with conspiracy tocontravene Section 13 of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act1958, police said.   County Natwest and UBS Phillips and Drew officials declinedcomment.   The police, and the Serious Fraud Squad, a central governmentalunit charged with investigating financial crime, have beenconducting an investigation into the case, which is known as theBlue Arrow affair.   The investigation began after the Department of Trade andIndustry released a report in July on events related to the sale ofBlue Arrow shares.   The report severely criticized National Westminster PLC, itsCounty Natwest unit and Union Bank of Switzerland's UBS Phillipsand Drew for their conduct.   When the $1.3 billion sale of Blue Arrow shares failed, CountyNatwest didn't disclose its 13.4-percent stake in Blue Arrow forthree months, in apparent violation of British regulations.   A series of top-level resignations followed publication of thetrade department's report, including the chairman of NationalWestminster, Lord Boardman, and three of his main board directors.   Those charged Thursday from County Natwest were: CharlesVilliers, former chairman; Jonathan Cohen, former chief executive;Stephen Clark, current financial director; David Reed, formerexecutive director, in charge of the corporate advisory department;and Nick Wells, formerly a senior director in that department.   Those charged from UBS Phillips and Drew were: ChristopherStainforth, former executive director of corporate finance; MartinGibbs, former director of corporate director of finance; andTimothy Brown and Paul Smallwood, directors in the firm's equitysales division.
