Ryzhkov visited UzbekistanMonday and an airlift began evacuating 17,000 Meshki Turks after aweek of ethnic violence in which some 100 people have been killed,Soviet media reported.   Rioting has centered in Uzbekistan's Fergana Valley. Most ofthose slain were Meshki Turks, an ethnic minority of 300,000 peoplemoved to Soviet Central Asia during World War II from Georgia, nearTurkey. The Turks have appealed repeatedly for permission to returnto Georgia. Dictator Josef Stalin ordered their transfer in 1944.   Government officials have blamed mobs of Uzbeks for most of theviolence.   No violence was reported Monday, but ``there are a lot of rumorsthat arouse panic and concern,'' said Vremya, the evening televisionnews program.   It showed Ryzhkov with former KGB chief Viktor M. Chebrikov, nowthe top Communist Party law-and-order official, and InteriorMinister Vadim Bakatin touring a state farm devastated by an arsonfire that left dozens of people homeless.   Tass, the official news agency, said the Kremlin delegation wassent to ``review on the spot questions about the normalization ofthe situation.''   People paused Monday to bury the dead for the first time sincethe violence began in the valley, a cotton- and grape-growing region1,500 miles southeast of Moscow, Vremya reported.   It said armed guards accompanied bus convoys of refugees, most ofthem Meskhi Turks, to an airport near Fergana city for evacuation tocentral Russia. Vremya gave the figure of 17,000 being evacuated andsaid some flights were delayed because many people lost theirdocuments in the rioting.   On Sunday, Vremya quoted a Meskhi spokesman as demandingimmediate evacuation to ``save our lives.''   A curfew imposed June 4 remained in force but all industrialcomplexes except chemical plants were operating, Vremya said.   Trouble was reported over the weekend in Namangan, another cityin Uzbekistan. Tass said more than 300 men marched to the railwaystation and stoned police, riots erupted in other parts of the cityand 28 people were arrested.   Security was reinforced around ``important projects,'' but thesituation in Namangan was under control, the agency said.   Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, said an armed mob tried tostorm a refugee camp over the weekend where Meshki had soughtsafety, but soldiers taken in by helicopter drove the attackers off,killing two.   A soldier killed an attacker who tried to grab his gun Sunday inMargilan and a patrol killed one motorcyclist and injured anotherwhen they fired a sawed-off shotgun in the city of Kokand, Tass said.   The government newspaper Izvestia said soldiers killed anattacker and wounded one Saturday in Kokand and, in Margilan, killeda driver who refused to stop.   On Monday, a telephone operator said no calls could be putthrough to Fergana because of the disturbances.   At least 1,000 people have been injured in the week of violence,according to the media reports. The military newspaper Red Star said136 Interior Ministry soldiers had been hurt.   More than 9,000 Interior Ministry troopers sent into the regionhave been unable to halt attacks by armed gangs of marauders,officials said.   The last time Soviet soldiers reportedly fired on civilians wasduring a clash with pro-independence protesters in Georgia on April9. It was reported that 20 people were slain. Georgian activistssaid the protesters were unarmed.   Government officials have said the Uzbek mobs have automaticweapons, firebombs and pitchforks.   An account Monday in Pravda said ``gangs of bandits, not evenmasquerading any more under the guise of `nationalist zealots,' arecontinuing to maraud, rob, burn and murder, not caring whichnation's property'' they pillage.   Rioters have set fire to hundreds of homes and other buildings.   Sunday night, state television showed some of an estimated 14,500Meskhi Turks at one refugee camp crowded into canvas tents.</TEXT></DOC>
