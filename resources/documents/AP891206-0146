They were tobe taken to the Philippine Army's headquarters at Fort Bonafacioabout 12 blocks away.   It was not clear if Enrile's announcement marked the end of thecoup, because rebels on Wednesday still held the Mactan Air Base inCebu, 350 miles south of Manila. At least 79 people have beenkilled and 570 others wounded since Friday.   The surrender came one day after about 1,800 foreigners,including more than 200 Americans, were evacuated from rebel-heldluxury hotels in Makati and Mrs. Aquino declared a national stateof emergency to deal with the crisis.</TEXT></DOC>
