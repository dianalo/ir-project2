Negotiations betwen the hospitals and representatives of theCalifornia Nurses Association ended just before midnight Monday,and the strike began at 7 a.m., a CNA spokeswoman said.   Karen Henry, chief negotiator for the hospitals, said her groupmade a new proposal but ``CNA refused to even submit that economicpackage to a vote.''   The hospitals, she said, asked the association to submit the newoffer to a vote of its membership before Friday and to extend thestrike deadline until then. The new offer included an immediate 7percent pay hike for all nurses, she said.   However, Donna Hansen of the CNA said the offer was``unacceptable'' and the hospitals were already 8 percent ``behindother area hospitals in wage.''   The nurses are seeking a 13 percent raise that would bringsalaries to $35,000 to $40,000 for day shifts. They are alsofighting hospital proposals for 12-hour shifts and demanding a 15percent differential for night shifts.   ``We think 12-hour shifts are unsafe as a general rule,'' saidJessie Bostelle, director of collective bargaining for the CNA.   The six Affiliated Hospitals transferred some intensive carepatients to other facilities Monday and planned to limit surgery toemergencies.   The average starting salary for a nurses working in the city forAffiliated Hospitals is $30,072 to $37,692 for day shifts and$34,583 to $43,346 for night shifts, according to a spokeswoman forthe hospitals.   The nurses say that although those salaries are higher than thenationwide average of about $28,000, they are lower than what 80percent of the hospitals in the San Francisco Bay area pay.   The strike was the first by registered nurses in the city since1974.   The six hospitals are Children's, Marshal Hale, Mount Zion, St.Francis and St. Mary's in San Francisco and Seton Medical Center inDaly City. Service workers struck those hospitals and one other aweek ago in a contract dispute.</TEXT></DOC>
