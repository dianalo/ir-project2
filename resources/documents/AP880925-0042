At the same time, the 18-month experiment, now about half over,has not created the disruptions expected by its critics, said ChiefAdministrative Judge Albert Rosenblatt.   ``If there's no apparent damage and if it doesn't disserve inany way the justice system, I think it's very hard to exclude onpractical, realistic or intellectual grounds,'' Rosenblatt said inan interview Friday.   ``If it's just a clean neutral, then the presence of atelevision camera should be no different than wallpaper or thecolor of the rug,'' he said. ``As long as it doesn't disserve, it'sa fact of life.''   The judge stressed, however, that it was premature to concludewhether the program should be extended past its May 31 expiration,and he was equivocal in discussing its results so far. If it isfound to be merely inoffensive, he said, it may not merit theadministrative burden it has placed on the courts.   Forty-four states allow some photographic coverage ofcourtrooms, although the federal court system does not. New York'sexperimental program began Dec. 1 in four upstate counties and June1 statewide; Rosenblatt is to report on it to the Legislature, thegovernor and the state's chief judge on March 31, two months beforeit ends.   The program allows camera and audio coverage of courtproceedings by radio and television stations, newspapers andacademic institutions, with approval of the presiding judge.Denials can be appealed.   As of mid-September, judges across the state had approved 427 of482 applications for coverage, or 88.6 percent. Moreover,Rosenblatt said he has received 255 evaluations of the program fromjudges, with only 41 opposed.   Lawyers, however, were divided: Of 225 who expressed views, 88were in favor, 84 opposed and 53 neutral. Some lawyers fear cameracoverage will intimidate witnesses and jurors and impart notorietyto their clients.   The greatest concern for the program was that the presence ofcameras and recording equipment would disrupt court proceedings,much as they did in the celebrated Lindbergh kidnapping trial in1935, when radio announcers and cameramen jammed the Flemington,N.J., courtroom.   Those fears have not been realized, Rosenblatt said, largelybecause of the advanced technology of electronic recordingequipment. But he said the greatest hopes for the program _ that itwould serve as an educational tool to increase public understandingof the court system _ haven't occurred.   ``An insight into the judicial process is a very healthy thingfor the community. We wanted to see whether that insight can bearranged without in any ways detracting from the quality of justicethat we want to have. That in a nutshell is really the basis forthe experiment,'' Rosenblatt said.   ``I'd been hopeful that the potential for education would berealized to perhaps a greater degree than it has been,'' he said.``We've not had a great deal of documentary coverage. We've not hada great deal of coverage that goes beyond the very, very briefsegments of what might be a particularly notorious trial.''   He said he would review the work of a committee evaluating theprogram, conduct public hearings and consider the comments oflawyers, judges and prosecutors before deciding whether torecommend continuing to allow cameras in state courtrooms.</TEXT></DOC>
