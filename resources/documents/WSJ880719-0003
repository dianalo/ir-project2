The Nasdaq Composite Index of 4,636 OTC stocks managed an 0.18 point rise to 394.77. Volume was light at 122.7 million shares, and advancing issues led decliners, 1,048 to 1,017. The increase in the index, although modest, was in contrast to the 11.56-point retreat by the Dow Jones Industrial Average of New York Stock Exchange blue chips.    The talk of the day among OTC traders was Viking Freight, which soared 13 to 34 3/4, a 59.8% rise, to easily lead the Nasdaq advancers' list. Viking agreed to be acquired by Roadway Services for $35.50 a share. Roadway, Nasdaq's biggest trucking stock, slipped 1/2 to 28 1/2; rival Yellow Freight System added 5/8 to 26 5/8.    MCI advanced 1 1/4 to 17 3/8 on nearly 5.4 million shares, by far the heaviest volume on Nasdaq yesterday. The Washington, D.C., telecommunications company reported second-quarter earnings of 25 cents a share, compared with three cents a year ago. MCI said the latest quarter includes a $9 million gain from an antitrust settlement and a $15 million tax credit.    MCI's surge contributed to a sharp rise in the Nasdaq utilities index, up 4.07 to 458.86, on a day when all other Nasdaq indexes barely budged.    Apple Computer added 1/2 to 45 1/2. The big computer company reported a 71% earnings increase that was almost as striking, but not as surprising, as MCI's enormous increase.    Micron Technology came under pressure following a Wall Street Journal story that computer memory chip prices have fallen 21% from their peak in May, causing hope that a chip shortage will ease by the end of the year. Micron fell 1 3/8 to 20 on nearly 2.2 million shares, making it the second most active Nasdaq issue.    Western Capital added 2 1/4 to 14 1/4 on heavy volume, after the Denver Post reported that Norwest Corp. might make a bid for the Denver thrift holding company.    Sizzler Restaurants International, one of Nasdaq's biggest restaurant stocks, slipped 1/4 to close at 18 1/2 after trading as low as 18. Traders took note that Caroline S. Levy, a restaurant analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, yesterday lowered both her short-term and long-term ratings. Having previously rated the company a &quot;2&quot; (buy), she now gives it a &quot;3&quot; (hold) -- meaning she no longer thinks the stock will outperform the market by 10% to 20%, but instead will only keep pace with the market.    The downgrading was made in conjunction with a sharp downward ratings change by Shearson yesterday on McDonald's, a New York Stock Exchange issue.    &quot;I feel (Sizzler) is slightly expensive, based on our new Sandamp;P-500 estimates,&quot; Ms. Levy asserted in an interview. Though Sizzler's fundamentals &quot;remain very attractive,&quot; she said, the stock is at a 30% premium to the Sandamp;P 500, based on calendar 1988 earnings. &quot;I'd be interested again at 17 to 17 1/2,&quot; Ms. Levy said.    Among other major Nasdaq restaurant stocks, Shoney's Inc. fell 1/8 to 27 3/4, Morrison dropped 1/8 to 22 1/4 and Ryan's Family Steak Houses fell 1/8 to 6 1/8 but Bob Evans Farms added 1/4 to 17 1/2. Also, International Dairy Queen Class A lost 1/4 to 35 1/4 and Dunkin' Donuts slipped 1/4 to 24 1/4.    Ms. Levy says she is generally &quot;nervous&quot; about restaurant stocks because of rising costs of both food -- because of the Farm Belt drought -- and wages. &quot;The combination is pretty lethal, I think. I don't think they'll be able to pass it on (to customers) in full,&quot; she added.    But for yesterday, at least, it was a grocery-store stock rather than a restaurant issue that got hit hardest by sellers. Convenient Food Mart plunged 2 1/2 to 6 1/2, a 27.8% fall, to lead the Nasdaq decliners' list. The decline was prompted by the Rosemont, Ill., company's announcement that, based on a continuing review of its 1987 audited financial statements, it expects to slash previously reported 1987 net income to $800,000, or 25 cents a share, from $2.5 million, or 81 cents a share.    ---   Robotool has been a hot stock lately. Since late May, when it was languishing at 3 1/4 bid, the company has been quoted as high as 14 before falling back. It closed yesterday at 12 bid, up 3/8.    News of two big contracts has contributed to investor interest in the Boulder, Colo.-based maker of machine-tool control systems. But there is some question just how much it will see from the deals.    Yesterday the company announced a contract, from an unidentified Japanese company, with &quot;a minimum sales potential&quot; of more than $10 million over three years. But in an interview, Albert J. Butta, president and chief executive officer, said that the Japanese buyer has placed orders that would bring in, at best, $3 million.    On July 7, Robotool announced another contract, covering purchases of about $7.2 million from Axon EDM Inc., a small Michigan company that had revenue of less than $1 million last year and is hoping for $2 million this year.    Mr. Butta insisted that Robotool is valuing the contracts conservatively. &quot;What we don't want to be accused of is hyping the stock,&quot; he said.    The company had revenue of $814,801 for the nine months ended Dec. 31. Year-end results have been delayed.    -- Karen Blumenthal</TEXT></DOC>
