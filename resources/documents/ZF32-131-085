Wilke Rd., Arlington Heights,IL 60004;800-233-0877.andP;  List Price: Control module, $3,995; user module,$3,495.andP;  In Short: Unlike other wireless LANs, Motorola's Altair works withany Ethernet network and LAN operating system to provide wireless connectionsbetween cable segments up to 130 feet apart.andP;  It gets high marks for ease ofinstallation and has adequate throughput.andM;Motorola's Wireless LANandM;Matches NCR WaveLan'sandM;Speed over Shorter DistanceandM;Motorola, the nation's premier two-way radio company, is channeling itsexpertise into Altair, a wireless LAN system based on what it calls theWireless Inbuilding Network (WIN) architecture.andM;Even in this emerging technology, the company already has severalcompetitors; Altair competes directly with NCR's WaveLAN (First Looks, May14, 1991) and Telesystems' SLW (&quot;The New Wave: LANs Without Wires,&quot; May 29,1990).andM;Altair operates at a frequency of 18 GHz (gigahertz)--an extremely high band,normally used for satellite communications--that benefits from beingrelatively free from interference and monitoring.andP;  By contrast, NCR's WaveLANuses special modulation techniques to spread its signal across the morecrowded frequencies near the cellular telephone band (a technique calledspread-spectrum broadcasting).andM;Altair's major distinction in its complete independence from LAN operatingsystems.andP;  Both NCR WaveLAN and Telesystems' ARLAN 450 resude inside anetworked PC and require special software drivers for each operating systemthey support.andM;The Altair unit, however, attaches to the LAN cable and simply moves Ethernetpackets.andP;  Altair works with any operating system that drives an Ethernetadapter board, including NetWare, LAN Manager, LAN-tastic, Unix, or VMS.andM;Altair's $7,490 list price buys the components needed to create a radiosystem to link two LAN segments, including thin Ethernet cable andterminator.andP;  This up-front cost is higher than WaveLAN's $2,780 entry cost,but Altair's cost per port drops to $715 in larger systems with 30 nodesconnected by radio.andM;It takes less time to install the Altair wireless system than to explain:Picture two Ethernet LAN segments, one with as many as 33 nodes and the otheras many as 7.andP;  One of the nodes on the larger segment is an Altair controlmodule with built-in transceiver and antenna.andM;One node on the smaller LAN segment is an Altair user module.andP;  Thesetransceiver and antenna systems move Ethernet packets between cable LANsegments over radio waves.andP;  Up to five user modules, with as many as sixattached computers or other devices, can communicate with one control module.andO;The control module operates as an intelligent bridge reading the address ofeach Ethernet packet and routing it to the correct user module.andM;Using PC Magazine LAN Labs' benchmark test, we measured an average throughputof about 470K bits per second when a 386SX PC made requests of a NetWare 3.1server over Altair.andP;  This is only slightly slower than NCR's WaveLAN and, forcomparison, about the same throughput would get from the hard disk drive ofan AT-class PC.andP;  However, over a standard copper LAN cable connection, thesame PC moved data with a sustained throughout of greater than 2 megabits persecond.andP;  So both wireless LAN systems ask you to trade off throughout forflexibility and ease of installation, even though either system has adequatethroughput for most offices.andM;The radio waves will travel up to 130 feet between the control and usermodules if the path is clear.andP;  When a path is cluttered with obstructions,such as dry wall and office furniture, the range drops to 40 feet.andP;  Thehigh-frequency signals used by Altair don't penetrate typical masonry walls.andO;Because WaveLAN operates at cellular wave-lenghts, its signals easily passthrough walls.andM;The Altair transmits at radiation levels well below the limits of bothEuropean and U.S.andP;  standards.andP;  Technically, you need an FCC license to havean Altair installation, but motorola holds licenses around the country andcoordinates your operation under its licensing arrangement.andM;An excellent alternative to wired LANs, Motorola's Altair doesn't offerthroughput as fast as copper cable, but it is most certainly a worthycompetitor for WaveLAN.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
