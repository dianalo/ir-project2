At a mid-morning news conference in the White House, Bush saidhe opposes House-passed legislation providing federal funds forabortions for poor women who are victims of incest or rape. But thepresident said he hoped compromise language would make it possibleto avoid a veto of the politically charged legislation.   On another controversial subject, Bush said he would permitlegislation banning flag burning to become law without hissignature. He said the legislation wasn't ``the ultimate answer,''and urged a constitutional amendment to do the same thing.   Bush signaled his desire for flexibility on other issues, aswell, including Democratic calls for expanded individual retirementaccounts and legislation to repeal catastrophic health care for theelderly.   But there was no give on his defense of his much-criticizedhandling of the failed coup attempt in Panama two weeks ago, whenU.S. troops stationed nearby were not directed to intervene onbehalf the rebels.   ``I would hope I would never be reckless enough ascommander-in-chief to make a commitment to force without knowingthe facts'' of a coup attempt. He said he'd seen no evidence of acrucial gap in intelligence.   ``I wouldn't mind using force if it could be done in a prudentmanner,'' he said in defending the decision not to take part in thecoup. ``So I'm not ruling out the use of force for all time.''   While saying he would not change his decision against usingforce, Bush acknowledged complaints about poor communication andother problems by the United States. He said they were ``well worthlooking into'' and that he was not opposed to ``fine-tuning'' hiscrisis-management system.   He hinted broadly he might seek congressional approval forgreater authority in dealing with situations like the coup inPanama. ``We may, we may,'' he said. ``I want as broad a power aspossible and I think under the Constitution the president has it.''   Bush continued his defense even as he was walking out of thebriefing room.   ``I can understand instant hawks appearing from where there usedto be the feathers of a dove, because some of it is political andsome of it is the frustration they feel because this man (Noriega)is still in office,'' he said.   Bush also urged Congress to approve his plan for a cut in thecapital gains tax, and said he would consider signing legislationthat combined his plan with a Democratic proposal liberalizingindividual retirement accounts.   ``The mixing of IRAs and capital gains in this debate istroublesome to me,'' Bush said. ``Whether there is room forcompromise on that, I'd leave it to those who are negotiating.''   Most of the attention during the question-and-answer session wasfocused on Noriega.   The Panamanian leader is under indictment in the United Statesfor drug trafficking, and the president said he's not willing tohave the indictment dropped in exchange for Noriega giving up power.   He blended his call for Noriega's ouster with his defense of hisown actions two weeks ago.   ``I am not going to give carte blanche support for an operation,particularly when they don't ask for that support,'' he said. ``Ihave to reserve that right, I have at stake the lives of Americankids.''   Bush brushed aside critics who said he missed an opportunity toassist in Noriega's ouster in the failed coup.   ``I've seen no fact that would make me change my view,'' he said.   On the flag legislation, the president said: ``I will allow thebill to become law, but without my signature. I am withholding thatsignature to signal our belief that the constitutional amendment isthe best way to provide protection for the flag.''   Asked about attempts in Congress to repeal catastrophic healthcare legislation for the elderly, Bush said he was ``letting thecongressional process hash this out.'   Bush was asked repeatedly about the volatile abortion issue, andsaid he hoped he could avoid a veto of legislation that calls forMedicaid funding for abortions for poor women who are victims ofrape and incest.   ``I'm not looking for any conflict over this,'' he said.   ``My position is well known and well stated and right now thereis some negotiations and discussion going on,'' said Bush. Aideshave suggested Bush would likely veto the bill if the House versionis embraced in the Senate.   He said he wanted to see if there is ``room for flexibility.''   The House has passed the provision and sent it to the Senate,which approved similar provision a year ago and is expected to doso again. ``The conference language may be able to avoid a veto onmy part.''</TEXT></DOC>
