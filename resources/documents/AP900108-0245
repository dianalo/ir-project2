Boesky's main arbitrage fund has beenliquidated and $248 million distributed to its limited partners tosettle one of many claims against the former Wall Streetspeculator, attorneys said Monday.   In addition, some lawsuits against the partnership, CX PartnersLP, have been settled and others placed on hold in Manhattanfederal court, where more than two dozen class-action lawsuitsagainst Boesky and affiliated entities await resolution.   The agreement between CX Partners and its 46 investors wasreached after more than three years of discussions and litigationdating to Boesky's November 1986 settlement of insider tradingcharges with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   David R. Herwitz, liquidating trustee for CX Partners, said theagreement was ``a major step in the resolution of disputes stemmingfrom Mr. Boesky's conduct.''   Still pending in the case that rocked Wall Street are completionof an SEC plan to use $50 million paid by Boesky to reimburseindividual investors who can prove they were defrauded by histrading.   Under the agreement liquidating CX Partners, formerly known asIvan F. Boesky andamp; Co., most of the limited partners received 100percent of their investment, Herwitz said.   The total equity investment in the fund, which Boesky formed inMarch 1986 to invest in stocks of potential takeover targets, was$338 million. But Boesky and his wife surrendered all theirinterests in the enterprise and some partners did not receive fullcompensation.   The limited partnerships included insurance companies, financialinstitutions and individual investors. Some future disbursements tothe partnerships are possible, Herwitz said.   Other details of the agreement were not made public, but sourcesfamiliar with the case said the Boeskys' interest in the fundtotaled around $10 million.   Guinness PLC, the largest holder in the fund with a $100 millionstake, received just $37 million of its claim, said GeorgeReycraft, a lawyer for the limited partners.   Other large stakes in the fund reportedly included $28 millionby Jeffrey M. Picower of New York, its largest investor; $10million by Lincoln National Life Insurance Co.; $10 million byBritain's Water Authorities Superannuation Fund; and $6 million byNew York investor Milton Dresner.   Monday's settlement included an agreement with Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc. resolving a series of issues surrounding the limitedpartners' investments. Drexel had an $8 million equity stake in theBoesky fund and owned $20 million of its debt.   Reycraft said Drexel received the full $20 million for the debtbut no interest or any of its equity investment. Under theagreement, Drexel will be dropped as a defendant in theBoesky-related lawsuits, he said.   But Reycraft said the limited partners planned to proceed withlitigation against Boesky and others, including former Drexelfinancier Michael Milken and admitted securities felons DennisLevine and Martin Siegel.   A Delaware court last year ruled that Drexel was entitled to getits money back before or at the same time as the partners. Drexelspokesman Steven Andreder declined to comment on the agreement,saying it was confidential.   Boesky, 52, is due to be released in April from a Brooklynhalfway house where he is completing a three-year prison term.Boesky pleaded guilty to one count of violating federal securitieslaws and paid $100 million to settle charges he led a network ofillegal trading using inside information.   The government is using $50 million of the money to compensateinvestors who can prove they were victimized by Boesky's trading.SEC officials had set Jan. 15 target date to establish a plan todistibute the money.   ``We are working toward achieving a plan for distribution of themoney but that may or may not have anything to do with aninvestors' settlement,'' said John H. Sturc, an SEC associateenforcement director.   Monday's settlements could help speed resolution of a mountainof lawsuits, including class-action shareholder cases and otherlitigation, attorneys said. Some of the charges involving CXPartners either have been settled or placed on hold, according tolawyers involved in the case.   The lawsuits are consolidated before U.S. District Judge MiltonPollack.   ``Some of these lawsuits will be reduced, abated or limited,''Herwitz said. ``Part of what is happening is people are going totry to save a dollar or two on litgation costs.''   Boesky and the entities he once controlled were inundated withlawsuits after federal authorities disclosed his alleged insidertrading activities. Most of the lawsuits are by shareholders whowere selling stock at the time Boesky and his associates werebuying.</TEXT></DOC>
