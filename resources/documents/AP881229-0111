Arenstein, herattorney. Mrs. Whitehead-Gould feels ``it's her duty to convey tothe public what surrogacy has done to her.''   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's unsuccessful legal fight to keep the childshe agreed to bear for another couple sparked nationwide debate onsurrogacy contracts.   The book, ``A Mother's Story,'' was written with Pennsylvaniainvestigative journalist Loretta Schwartz-Nobel and published by St.Martin's Press.   The first printing will be 100,000 copies, and the company hasset aside $100,000 for advertising and promotion, said MaryanneMazzola, publicity director for the publisher.   The 31-year-old Mrs. Whitehead-Gould lives in Bayport, N.Y., withher second husband and three of her children _ Ryan, 14; Tuesday,12, and Austin, 7 months, Arenstein said.   ``She is pregnant and she is happy about it,'' the attorney added.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould gave birth in 1986 to the girl originallyknown in court papers as Baby M. At the time, she was married toRichard Whitehead.   When she refused to give up the child, whom she agreed to bearunder a $10,000 contract for William and Elizabeth Stern of Tenafly,N.J., a landmark court battled ensued.   Stern, eventually granted custody of the girl by the New JerseySupreme Court, had tried to stop Mrs. Whitehead-Gould from writingthe book, arguing it would exploit the child, named Melissa.   But a Superior Court judge ruled that the book could focus onMrs. Whitehead-Gould's relationship with the child up until hersecond birthday.</TEXT></DOC>
