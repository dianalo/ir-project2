During the past fewweeks, stories on the &quot;military's restrictive coverage&quot; haveabounded. But I would argue that the military has not exertedenough control.   In the public relations business we have learned how towork with the media to protect our clients' interests withoutcompromising the public's need to know. We help corporations,interest groups and foreign governments communicate theirstory to the public. We must argue our side as forcefully aspossible and trust the news media will search out theopposing view. We are rarely disappointed.</LP><TEXT>   The media have no right to expect the military to do morethan present its own side as factually and forcefully as itcan.   The military's performance so far sets a standard foropenness most corporations would have problems matching. Assomeone who has advised corporations during labor unrest andhostile takeovers, it is obvious to me that the military ismaking an effort at cooperating with the media. But someindependent, outside coaching could improve performance.   -- One source of information. A corporation never wouldface a crisis with the CEO issuing statements fromheadquarters and the divisional presidents briefing thenational press from the local level. The military must stopholding briefings both at the Pentagon and in Riyadh. Thecontradictions are mounting and their credibility is falling.There have been contradictions on the number of Marineskilled in the first ground action. The number of Scud missilelaunchers destroyed was first set at one number in Riyadhonly to be reset at another number at the Pentagon. If heavyground action begins, these contradictions will grow evenmore common.   The solution is one briefing originating in either placelinked via satellite to the other. This is a public relationstactic corporations use to ensure uniformity in theircomments to the media.   -- Tell them why you can't tell them. In response to somequestions, military spokesmen have avoided direct statements,saying that to answer would reveal &quot;operational details&quot; orthreaten &quot;operational security.&quot; The media are tired of thisnon-answer. The military must make a strenuous effort toexplain why those questions cannot be answered.   A reporter recently grew angry at a briefer in Riyadh whowould not comment on the weather conditions over Baghdad. Thereporter pointed out that the Iraqis could &quot;look out thewindow&quot; to see the weather, so it obviously was not amilitary secret. The briefer shrugged off the question. Amore productive approach would have been to respond thattelling the Iraqis our forecast would only help themdetermine the accuracy of our forecasts. The briefer couldalso explain that to say the weather is clear is tantamountto announcing an impending air attack.   -- Accept the move to the front. The military has deniedall requests to move live coverage to the front. All groundaction we have seen so far is from videotape shot and rushedback to a satellite uplink. If our ground troops start tomove into Kuwait, there will be attempts to report live fromthe front with or without military approval.   Already, the attempt by CBS's Bob Simon to get uniquecoverage near the border resulted in the disappearance of himand his crew. The military needs an approach that points outand reinforces the danger involved, for the reporters' ownsafety and the military's interests.   First the stick: If a network sends a crew to the frontwithout a military escort there should be a reduction in thatnetwork's access to satellite time and elimination ofsatellite access if there are more incidents. The Israelistook a hard line with NBC when security guidelines wereviolated; the Pentagon needs to be just as strict. Then thecarrot: The military needs to send a satellite truck to thefront and offer its own feed. It won't make the networksperfectly happy, but it will make it harder for them tocomplain.   Does anyone doubt that showing a single engagement in abattlefield that spans hundreds of miles would inaccuratelyportray the war? Yet, unless the military finds ways to feedthe news media enough controlled access to the front, this isexactly what will happen.   -- Ration the visuals. The videotape of bombing missionsthe military has offered so far is spectacular, but thenumber of times these inside glimpses are provided should belimited. Reporters will be impressed only so many times.   There are at least three &quot;watershed&quot; events that coulddramatically affect news coverage of the conflict: groundtroops moving into Kuwait, chemical weapons use by Iraq, andthe coalition occupying Kuwait City. It would be wise to savethe &quot;action&quot; video for these events.   The military also has failed to use another visualeffectively: that of &quot;live heroes.&quot; The airmen who rescued adowned pilot in Iraq were interviewed on a tarmac for 30seconds. Reporters will appreciate interviewing these peoplein the briefing room at greater length.   As the media environment changes, the military will haveto be more innovative to ensure its side of the story isn'toverwhelmed by the observations of the media. Unless themilitary changes how it handles the press, the odds ofmeeting that goal are 50-50 at best.   ---   Mr. McAvoy is executive vice president of Ruder Finn inWashington.</TEXT></DOC>
