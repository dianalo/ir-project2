Anti-apartheid leaders welcomed the move but urged the governmentto scrap all discriminatory laws, including measures extreme-rightlocal officials are using to resegregate public facilities.   Last week, the Conservative Party-controlled town council inBoksburg voted to bar blacks from most municipal facilities. OnTuesday, Conservative councilors in Brakpan, another industrial townnear Johannesburg, similarly decided to ban blacks from publicparks, toilets and sports facilities.   The President's Council, dominated by the governing NationalParty, sent the residential segregation bill back to President P.W.Botha with a recommendation it be redrafted to ease penalties anddecriminalize some offenses related to the Group Areas Act. The act,a cornerstone of South Africa's legalized race segregation calledapartheid, prevents people of one race from living in areasdesignated for each of the other race groups.   The bill was referred to the council because of a deadlock inParliament: it was passed by the National Party-dominated whitechamber but rejected by the Asian and mixed-race chambers.   South Africa's majority 26 million blacks are not represented inParliament and have no vote in national affairs.   The proposal to impose sharply increased fines on violators ofthe Group Areas Act had been widely criticized abroad and byanti-apartheid activists in South Africa. Even before it reached thePresident's Council, the bill was softened by removal of a proposalfor mandatory evictions of people living illegally outside theirdesignated race zones.   Peter Marais, a mixed-race council member, likened the bill toNazi persecution of the Jews.   Several anti-apartheid council members said discriminatory lawscaused the current controversy in Boksburg.   ``What is happening in Boksburg must be a lesson to all of us,''said Marais. ``Don't leave matches lying around for children to playwith.''   The actions in Boksburg have been criticized by governmentofficials, white businessmen and sports organizations, as well aslocal blacks who have begun to boycott the industrial town'swhite-owned businesses.   Foreign Minister Pik Botha warned it could cause toughersanctions and urged people to oppose discrimination based ``merelyon the color of one's skin.''   Businessmen and several national sports organizaions have warnedthey will shun Boksburg because of the negative publicity.   Some liberals suggested the outcry was hypocritical becauseBoksburg council is exercising discriminatory powers allowed underthe National Party-approved Separate Amenities Act and employedelsewhere, including in the capital city, Pretoria.   ``Mr. Botha seems to be missing the point,'' said Jannie Momberg,co-chairman of the anti-apartheid Independent Party. ``What theConservative Party is doing is legal ... It's National Party lawsthat have given South Africa a bad name.''</TEXT></DOC>
