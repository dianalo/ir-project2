The results are summarized as follows: An experimental systemof the reluctance motor using amorphous cores was consitited to revealthe constants of the motor. As compared with cores of silicon steel,the loss of the amorphous cores was one-fourth or lower, and the efficiencyof the trial machine was enhanced by 6% or higher. The trial machinecould be operated at 48,000 rpm, 372 w, and 85% in efficiency. Theseresults shows that a super high speed motor sufficient for practicaluse can be manufactured with amorphous material. (11 figs, 4 tabs, 6refs)</TEXT></DOC>
