The 308-117 roll call followed final reductions from themilitary and World Bank accounts that the Bush administrationconsiders the most important, but the White House prevailedelsewhere on two heated fights over international familyplanning and U.S. assistance to the non-communist forces inCambodia.</LP><TEXT>   By a 260-163 margin, the House approved a $7 millionprovision continuing the Cambodia funding. However, theprogram would be limited to non-lethal assistance, and newrestrictions were imposed in response to criticism that theinsurgents are mounting military operations in cooperationwith the Khmer Rouge.   The victory represented a personal triumph for Rep.Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.), who has been a major influence inshaping the U.S. policy, but Washington's role in the warremains controversial because of the brutal history of theKhmer Rouge when it took over Cambodia in the 1970s.   The overt funding at issue is supplemented by a covertintelligence program supporting the non-communist resistancegroups. And though no direct aid is permitted to the KhmerRouge, critics argue that it has become impossible toguarantee that U.S. assistance isn't helping the Pol Potforces in battle or political negotiations.   The restrictions on military aid to El Salvador are inline with provisions adopted this spring by the House, butthe State Department is pressing for a less severealternative that would withhold about 30% of the assistance.Secretary of State James Baker has warned that he will seek aveto if a compromise can't be reached, but the administrationfaces opposition from some of its strongest supporters in thepast on Central America.   &quot;I'm not just going to roll over,&quot; said Rep. John Murtha(D., Pa.), chairman of the House Appropriations defensesubcommittee. &quot;I want something that shows the Salvador armythey have to reform.&quot;   Though Israel is among those protected from cuts inassistance, the Israeli government was warned in floor debatethat it too could face reductions if no agreement is reachedon new settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   &quot;The U.S. has no obligation to fund directly or indirectlysettlements that we regard as an impediment to the peaceprocess,&quot; said Rep. David Obey, chairman of the ForeignOperations subcommittee. The Wisconsin Democrat made a &quot;flatcommitment&quot; that he would support cuts if recommended by theBush administration in response to the Israeli settlementissue.   Under pressure from the administration, the HouseAppropriations leadership had agreed to provide $50 millionin new capital for the World Bank. But this funding, $60million less than the president's request, was hurt by asweeping 2% reduction approved minutes before final passageof the bill. Total U.S. contributions to internationalfinancial organizations would be effectively frozen atcurrent levels, but U.S. Export-Import Bank funding wasexempted and would grow to $750 million, 50% above the WhiteHouse request.   The same 2% cut helped to push total foreign military aiddown to $4.6 billion, or about $222 million below this year'slevel and more than $410 million under the president'sbudget. Secretary Baker is sure to demand the restoration ofpart of these funds in the Senate, but in the Houseallocation, the State Department and Pentagon benefit fromadded flexibility allowed by Mr. Obey, who resisted effortsto earmark funding outside the Mideast.   Among countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,Turkey stands to be most affected by the proposed militarycuts. But the shift in priorities stands to benefit EasternEurope, where the bill would add an estimated $180 million tothe administration request for economic assistance. Aid tosub-Saharan Africa would grow to $800 million, or 40% abovecurrent funding, but this increase is combined with newrestrictions effectively denying any direct funding toZaire's Mobutu regime.   An estimated $245 million is allocated elsewhere forpopulation-planning accounts, including $1.5 million forRomania. But on a 224-198 roll call, anti-abortion forcesupheld restrictions that effectively bar two of the largestorganizations, the International Planned ParenthoodFederation and the United Nations Fund for PopulationActivities, from participating.   The floor action came as President Bush's ambitious moonand Mars space initiative met further setbacks in the SenateCommerce Committee, which cut all of an estimated $188million in new money for the undertaking. The HouseAppropriations Committee this week made even deeper cuts fromrelated programs, and though the White House hopes to restorefunds in the Senate, the Commerce Committee vote was aserious blow to this effort.</TEXT></DOC>
