The 48-45 vote provoked bitter protests from Republican Whip Alan Simpson, who maneuvered to force a second roll call next week on rescinding yesterday's action. The Wyoming conservative, who took the lead in enacting the immigration overhaul, criticized the proposed delay as &quot;unnecessary and inappropriate,&quot; but he lost support from fellow Republicans in the Southwest, where the sanctions are likely to have the greatest impact.    As proposed by Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), the amendment would postpone the effective date for the sanctions from June 1 to Oct. 1. The language was first attached by the Senate Appropriations Committee to an estimated $9.4 billion supplemental spending bill currently pending before the full chamber. Yesterday's vote was on the question of upholding the committee's action.    Sen. Simpson switched his vote at the last minute to side with the majority, a move that allowed him to force the motion requiring a second roll call next week. If he hadn't done so, the final margin would have been as narrow as 47-46. </TEXT></DOC>
