Carley (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> UTX GE </CO><IN> ARO AIR </IN><TEXT>   Lufthansa German Airlines' cancellation of an order for V2500 jet engines from a consortium led by United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitney division appears to be a major blow for the engine project, industry officials and analysts said.    But the consortium said development and marketing of the engines to other airlines would continue.    Lufthansa had planned to use the engines on Airbus A-320 jets, for which it has placed 15 firm orders and taken 25 options. Valued at about $8 million for each plane, engines for the 15 planes on firm order would cost about $120 million and those for the 25 optioned aircraft would cost another $200 million.    In announcing the cancellation late Friday, Lufthansa said it would switch to the CFM-56 engine for its new A-320s, which are made by Airbus Industrie, a European consortium. The CFM-56 is made by a joint venture of General Electric Co. and Societe Nationale d'Etude et de Construction de Moteurs d'Aviation, or Snecma, of France, each of which has a 50% interest.    &quot;Clearly, this switch is a disappointment for Pratt andamp; Whitney,&quot; said Christopher Demisch, a First Boston Corp. analyst. Mr. Demisch noted that Lufthansa was one of the biggest customers for the engine, which is still under development and has yet to prove its reliability.    The V2500 engine is made by International Aero Engines, a consortium including Pratt andamp; Whitney, which holds a 30% interest; Rolls-Royce Ltd. of Britain, which holds 30%; Japanese Aero Engines, a consortium of several Japanese companies, with 23%; MTU Motoren und Turbinen Union Munchen G.m.b.H of West Germany, with 11%; and Fiat Aviazione S.p.A., a unit of Fiat S.p.A. of Italy, with 6%.    During development, the engine has encountered a host of technical problems, mostly in the section of the engine being developed by Rolls-Royce. As a result, Pratt andamp; Whitney took over technical control of the project last year. Flight testing of the engine is to begin in July, and the engine is scheduled to go into service with airlines in April of next year.    Lufthansa said it canceled the V2500 order because the technical problems raise the possibility that the engine won't be ready in time. This could delay delivery of the A-320 jets, a business risk that Lufthansa said it was reluctant to take.    The airline also said it wanted to avoid &quot;repeated modifications&quot; of the engine. Because of its technical problems, the V2500, to reach performance specifications such as low fuel consumption, may have to be modified several times even after initial deliveries. Such modifications can cause disruptions in airline operations.    Lufthansa also questioned whether the V2500's thrust can be increased enough to power heavier jets that the carrier might buy in the future. And Lufthansa questioned whether the V2500 would be sufficiently reliable.    In recent years, Pratt andamp; Whitney has introduced other engines that some airlines have avoided because of their unproven reliability. GE has upgraded its older, proven engines, and their reliability has given the company a sales advantage -- and the No. 1 spot in the global commercial jet engine market formerly held by Pratt andamp; Whitney.    Lufthansa's criticism of the V2500 carries special weight because of the West German carrier's reputation in the industry for superior technical expertise. As a result, some analysts said, Lufthansa's decision may influence other airlines.    In a separate statement, Pratt andamp; Whitney said it remains &quot;fully committed&quot; to the engine project, noting that the consortium still has more than $1 billion in firm orders and options from six customers. The remaining customers are Pan Am Corp.'s Pan American World Airways, Indian Airlines, Cyprus Airways, Australian Airlines, Royal Jordanian Airline and Adris Airways of Yugoslavia. </TEXT></DOC>
