This question is pertinentbecause the Valles Marineris are gigantic grabens, rivaling rift valleyson earth in size and depth. The Valles Marineris were interpreted asextensional tectonic structures, perhaps incipient rifts. On earth, riftvalleys commonly contain volcanic deposits. On Mars, deposits insidethe Valles Marineris grabens do not have the morphologic signature ofsuch easily identified volcanic features as shield volcanoes or lavaflows. Therefore, many researchers have not recognized the deposits insidethe Valles Marineris as volcanic. Is Mars, then, different from earthin having formed riftlike grabens unaccompanied by volcanism. Overall,results from the study suggest that volcanism was present in the VallesMarineris; the volcanism was explosive in places; some volcanism wasmore felsic than that generally assumed elsewhere; and the younger sequenceof interior beds was emplaced so late in Martian history that the planetmay be considered to be still volcanically active.</TEXT></DOC>
