One way for the drilling industry to surviveand recover in the future, therefore, is to lower costs, increase efficiency,and become more attractive for the operators. Besides the logical reactionto reduce costs by cut backs in personnel and overhead, possibilitiesof increasing rig efficiency should be carefully studies. The efficiencyof a drilling rig is increased when the maximum rig time is spent onbottom, making hole at optimum penetration rates. This means concentratingefforts to minimize rig moving time and increasing the percentage oftime making hole. This can be achieved by study of the drilling processand designing, selecting, and matching components to it.</TEXT></DOC>
