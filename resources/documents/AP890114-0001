(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dennis Elmore figures he proved he's anAmerican by serving in Vietnam, so he refuses to document hiscitizenship to keep his job.   That refusal got the 40-year-old machinist fired Friday, thedeadline his boss set for filling out a government form employershave to keep to prove all their workers are citizens or legal U.S.residents.   ``When I was 18 years old, they sent me a draft notice. They knewI was a citizen then,'' Elmore said.   His boss, Dick Fisher of Sandamp;D Specialties, said he wishes he couldkeep Elmore in the $12-an-hour job making parts for hydrauliccylinders. But if he did, the company would risk a $500 fine forfailing to keep the new form required by the Immigration andNaturalization Service.   ``They didn't give me a lot of options. It's a federal law,''Fisher said.   The law is part of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of1986, which extended amnesty to illegal aliens who can prove they'relongtime U.S. residents. The law also imposed the employer penaltiesin hopes of cutting the influx of new illegals.   Elmore acknowledged the government didn't want much: He wassupposed to fill out the form and supply driver's license and SocialSecurity numbers.   ``It's a matter of principle, all right,'' he said.   He ignored the form during the six months he's been working inthis town 50 miles east of Los Angeles. But Fisher decided he had toset a deadline, and the men agreed Friday would be Elmore's lastunless he did the paperwork.   Elmore went to Vietnam as an Army enlisted man in 1969 and saidthe government should have taken military service into account.   Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman Ron Rogers inLos Angeles said the service can't make exemptions for veterans.   ``Does he want to cooperate and help us control our border?''Rogers asked. ``He did serve his country, and this is another way ofhelping his country.''   Elmore doesn't have any firm plans for a job hunt. One thing'sfor sure: He won't take a job if they ask him to fill out theimmigration form.   ``I don't think I will,'' he said. ``I really don't.''</TEXT></DOC>
