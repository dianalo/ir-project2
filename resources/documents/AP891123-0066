There were few reports of gunfire in the capital, and themorning was largely peaceful for the first time since theguerrillas offensive began.   The guerrillas renewed their cease-fire proposal Wednesday night.   ``They have always tried to change what it means to have acease-fire,'' said Sandoval. He noted that the communique hadn'tbeen addressed to the government but rather to the people ofSalvador and the international community and said that thegovernment would give no formal reply.   ``They are doing this because of the big defeat they suffered,because their offensive failed,'' said Sandoval in a telephoneinterview.   President Alfredo Cristiani said on Wednesday that he believedthe rebels might renew their attacks.   The guerrilla offer came late Wednesday after the quietest daythe capital has experienced since a rebel offensive began Nov. 11.Salvadorans began slowly emerging from hiding, stores reopened andcleanup efforts began.   ``The shock is over and we can open our market for business,''said a woman from the battered Mejicanos neighborhood.   This morning, at a food distribution center in Ciudad Delgado,more than 400 people lined up for food, although workers insidesaid they didn't know if they would get any.   Gravediggers worked through the morning at the Soyapangocemetery, burying victims of the fighting near the curb outside thewalls because there was no room left inside. More than 1,000 peoplehave died in the recent fighting.   The offensive seemed to be over following an attack on thewealthy Escalon neighborhood and the occupation of a luxury hoteltrapped a small group of U.S. Army Green Berets for 28 hours.   President Bush sent a team from the elite Delta Force to rescuethe soldiers if need be, but the guerrillas slipped away after duskTuesday.   The Green Berets left the compound Wednesday, sprinting acrossthe pool deck of the hotel.   Late Wednesday, the rebel Farabundo Marti National LiberationFront renewed its offer to accept a negotiated cease-fire thatwould be verified by the United Nations.   ``To the Security Council of the U.N. we express our dispositionto define an immediate cease-fire,'' the rebels said in acommunique read on Radio Venceremos. The rebels this morningchanged that section to read, ``our willingness to cooperate withthe measures that are adopted in favor of an immediate cease-firein our country.''   The issue of whether to negotiate or ``define'' the details of acease-fire before it goes into effect has been a key sticking pointon which peace talks foundered in September and October.   There was no immediate comment to the modification from theSalvadoran government, which has proposed an immediate cease-fireto be followed by negotiations. But before the guerrilla positionwas announced Cristiani seemed to play down the possibility ofdirect talks in the near future.   ``The worst is over, but I don't think Escalon was the lastgasp. They are doing some things that look more like regroupingthan withdrawing,'' Cristiani said in an interview Wednesdayafternoon.   He noted that Joao Baena Soares, the Brazilian secretary-generalof the Organization of American States, had been in town on a peacemission but left shortly after he was whisked out of the luxuryhotel during the rebel attack.   ``Maybe he saw enough to draw his conclusions,'' said Cristiani.</TEXT></DOC>
