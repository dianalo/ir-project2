Separately, Avery said a loss from discontinued operations of $4.4 million made its net loss $5.4 million for the third quarter ended June 30.    The management group, led by Uniroyal President Robert Mazaika, had planned to pay $240 million cash. The terms were changed to complete financing for the transaction, Avery said.    Uniroyal Chemical Holding, Middlebury, Conn., is the parent of Uniroyal Chemical Co., a maker of pesticides, rubber additives, and other chemical products. The company's controversial apple-growth regulator, Alar, was withdrawn from the market earlier this year.    Avery has said that when it sells Uniroyal Chemical, it expects to have $20 million to $25 million in cash and no other material assets or liabilities. It plans to use the profit from the sale to make an acquisition.    The leveraged buy-out, expected to close Sept. 29, will be submitted to Avery's stockholders for a vote at the annual meeting Sept. 21.    Avery, which started out as a coal company in 1984, bought Uniroyal Chemical from Uniroyal Inc. in October 1986 for $710 million, an acquisition it financed through $910 million of high-yield, high-risk junk bonds.    In last year's third quarter, a loss from discontinued operations of $8.9 million and a gain of $2.1 million from early extinguishment of debt resulted in a net loss of $7.1 million. The loss from continuing operations widened to $1 million in the quarter from $238,000 a year earlier.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Avery shares closed at $1.25, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
