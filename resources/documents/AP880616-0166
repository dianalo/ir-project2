Nearly all the contributions from Citizen Action went to Senateor House candidates. But at the top of the committee's list was theDukakis for President Committee.   Steve Akey, spokesman for Michael Dukakis said, however, thatthe campaign's financial records showed no contribution fromCitizen Action.   The allegations were denied by a top official of Citizen Action,who claimed the allegations are ``filled with outright falsehoodsand clever distortions.''   The GOP committee alleged at a news conference that CitizenAction and its affiliates in 24 states formed corporations withtax-exempt status that went beyond their legal bounds of promotingissues solely among members. Instead, the committee said, CitizenAction and its affiliates used donations to make a pitch forparticular political candidates to members and the general public.   In addition, the committee charged, Citizen Action did notreport its activities on behalf of candidates as independentexpenditures or direct contributions to the candidates.   Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., who spoke at the news conference,said the senatorial committee is charging that while Citizen Actionenjoys preferential tax-exempt status from the IRS, it is ``heavilyinvolved in political activities that are completely inconsistentwith its tax-exempt status.''   Kasten, who said affiliates of Citizen Action worked against himin his 1986 re-election bid, also contended that it is improper tocall the group a citizens group because it is ``not volunteer, withordinary citizens participating in democracy. These are paid,organized workers.''   Kasten described Citizen Action's efforts as ``a nationalconspiracy of radical political groups'' and said the groups ``areguilty of massive federal election and tax law violations.''   In a statement, Robert Brandon, vice president of CitizenAction, said the allegations by the Republican committee ``arefilled with outright falsehoods and clever distortions.'' And incomments immediately after the committee's news conference, Brandonsaid that the financial records of Citizen Action and itsaffiliates are audited regularly by the IRS   ``What we do is no different from what thousands of other groupslegitimately do _ trying to win meaningful changes on issues ofconcern to their members,'' he said, citing as examples theNational Rifle Association and the Sierra Club.   Specifically, the committee charges that affiliates of the 1.75million-member Citizen Action are incorporated as either socialwelfare or charitable organizations under the Internal RevenueCode. Both types of organizations are tax exempt. However, the codestipulates that charitable organizations cannot be involved inpolitics, while social welfare organizations are allowed to engagein partisan politics, but only among members, the committee said.   Jann L. Olsten, executive director of the GOP committee, allegedthat members of Citizen Action go door to door, speaking aboutissues and in the process ``deliver partisan messages on behalf ofor against a candidate.'' At the same time, Olsten said, canvasserswill ask for a financial contribution.   ``Money is being given to tax-exempt organizations and it isbeing used for partisan political campaigns,'' Olsten said.   Kasten added, ``These people are not supposed to be primarilyinvolved in the elections process, but this is a significantelection effort.''   Olsten said that the committee is asking the IRS to withdrawCitizen Action's tax-exempt status.</TEXT></DOC>
