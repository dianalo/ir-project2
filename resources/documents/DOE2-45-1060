Work is continuing on the identification, collection, and criticalevaluation of more recent literature. Preliminary results have shownthat the reaction of coal samples with powdered sodium hydroxide at controlledtemperatures could likely lead to the step-wise conversion of sulfurforms from the coal into water-soluble forms. Determination of totalsulfur in the reacted coal residues, after removal of these water-solublesulfur species formed by reactions with the caustic, and calculations(on a common basis) of the percent sulfur removed at a given temperatureare anticipated to provide a reasonable and useful indication of thepercentage of individual sulfur forms initially present. Subsequent determinationof total sulfur in the aqueous solutions removed by water-washing shouldgive similar data to corroborate the conclusions. 17 refs., 2 figs.,1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
