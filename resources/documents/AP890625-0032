Like several others working for China, Hansell said there ``isn'tall that much activity'' these days with the Chinese government,which is undergoing an internal shake-up in connection with apro-democracy uprising eventually put down by the army.   Although Communist hard-liners purged party chief Zhao Ziyang,their selection of his replacement over the weekend indicated thatthe economic reforms championed by Zhao and other moderates will notbe abandoned.   It is that pattern of economic change over the past decade thathas generated China's need for considerable professionalrepresentation in the United States.   Hansell's law firm alone was paid roughly $38,000 in the last sixmonths of 1988 for work that included contacting American officials``to express the PRC's concerns and interests as well as to obtaininformation'' on issues such as family planning practices, China'ssale of weapons to the Middle East and the export of U.S. satellitesfor launch, according to Justice Department records.   The firm called or visited people at the State Department and onCapitol Hill, among others, records show.   The department's latest filings show at least six law firms areregistered as working for China. The Foreign Agents Registration Actrequires anyone ``engaging in political activities for or on behalfof foreign governments'' to disclose their the nature of the workand the amount they are paid.   At another law firm, the recent upheaval has delayed plans torevive business, said Elliot Richardson, the former attorney generalwho works for Milbank, Tweed, Hadley and McCloy.   ``We were not actively doing anything lately and the prospect ofpursuing what we were doing has definitely been deferred,''Richardson said, noting his plans to attend a recent tradeconference in Beijing were scrapped.   Last year, Milbank, Tweed advised China on trade relations withthe United States and monitored the status of trade legislation inCongress. But the firm did not receive any money from China duringthe first six months of 1988.   Michael Daniels, a lawyer with Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexanderand Ferdon, said it would be ``premature to make any kind of''decision about the firm's relationship with China's state-ownedcorporation that handles textile imports and exports.   ``We think the situation is extremely confused,'' he said.Pointing to the Bush administration's plea for patience in dealingwith China, Daniels said his firm was in a holding pattern and wouldnot cut ties with the Chinese corporation.   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and other members of Congress haveurged President Bush to take a tougher stand on China, blockingtrade and stopping new investments to protest human rights abuses.   Bush has already suspended military sales to China and promised asympathetic review of visa applications for Chinese students whofear returning to their native land.   Mudge, Rose, which has represented the Chinese corporation since1985, received about $35,000 for its work the following year,records show.   At Laxalt, Washington, Perito and Dubuc, a law firm headed byformer Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev., the staff has performed minor workfor Air China, which has permission to fly between Chinese citiesand New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago, saidCarroll Dubuc.   ``We do limited work'' for Air China, he said. Among otherthings, the firm filed the necessary papers to change the airline'sname from the Civil Aviation Authority of China to Air China. Thelaw firm reported getting paid $5,341 on March 6, 1989.   Air China continues to fly between the United States and China,according to Jian Min Hhai in the airline's New York office.   The staff at Garvey, Schubert and Barer refused to discuss thefirm's work for the China Ocean Shipping Co. But U.S. records saidthe firm performed legal work and monitored the Federal MaritimeCommission's rule-making authority. The firm was paid nearly $3,000between September 1988 and January 1989 for the work.   Several telephone calls to the press office at the ChineseEmbassy to inquire about the government's relationship with U.S.agents were not answered.</TEXT></DOC>
