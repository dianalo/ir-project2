Previously, tanks went underground to provide a safe andconvenient method for handling liquids. Unfortunately, the environmentalimpact of leakage from those containers was not anticipated, nor weretank designs properly configured to minimize the threat. As local officialsbecame alert to the potential for damage, public pressure forced tankowners to rethink this casual practice. Manufacturers and suppliers oftanks and associated hardware have moved rapidly to the new state ofthe art called for to meet the new standards for storage techniques,and to provide effective leak prevention and detection. This paper presentsa chronology of the progress made to date in storage equipment and operatingpractices to provide the environmental protection demanded of undergroundtank owners and operators. Tank design, secondary containment, monitoring,spill and overfill protection, tank testing methods, and installationand closure procedures-as related to leak prevention-are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
