The radio, in a report monitored in Rome and London, said Arafatspoke Sunday after a meeting with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.   The leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization said he hadtold Gadhafi of the Palestinians' ``solidarity with the Libyan Arabpeople and its leader, who are facing U.S. threats,'' Libyan Radioreported.   ``We will stand by our people in the Great Jamahiriyah (Libya)with our blood,'' he was quoted as saying.   Arafat was apparently referring to U.S. charges that a plant atRabta, 60 miles southwest of Tripoli, was producing chemicalweapons. Libya says it makes pharmaceuticals.   Earlier this month, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidhe did not rule out a U.S. military strike to shut down the factory.   Fire swept through the plant on Wednesday and Libya has accusedthe United States and West Germany of involvement.   The radio said Arafat left Tripoli Sunday afternoon, but did notsay how long he had stayed. Arafat is a frequent visitor to Libya.</TEXT></DOC>
