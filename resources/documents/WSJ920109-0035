It's the second time in the past few months that pressurefrom the United Shareholders Association, a shareholderadvocacy group, has prompted changes in corporate pay-relatedpractices. Last fall, New York-based ITT Corp. agreed torevise its pay practices to more closely mirror performance.</LP><TEXT>   Although UAL's move is less sweeping than ITT's,compensation consultants still termed it significant. &quot;It'sbeen unusual up until now, but now there's a very pronouncedtrend for management to negotiate with shareholders&quot; oncompensation matters, said Robert Salwen, a consultant withWilliam M. Mercer Inc.   United Shareholders Association said UAL, the parent ofUnited Airlines based in Elk Grove Village, Ill., has agreedthat in its 1992 proxy, it will make a clearer disclosure ofsuch items as the split between annual pay and bonus; thebasis for payment of any bonus and the time period the bonuscovers; stock options and restricted stock grants; and thecompensation consultant used by the compensation committee.   UAL spokeswoman Lynn Martenstein declined to discussspecific changes, saying only that &quot;we are in completeagreement with the United Shareholders Association and arepleased that their concerns have been addressed.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
