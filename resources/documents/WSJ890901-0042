Critics charge it has enabled the White House's Office of Management and Budget to usurp the regulatory authority that Congress delegates to some 100 agencies.    More than bureaucratic turf is at stake. Many of the regulations being blocked by OMB in the name of paperwork reduction are basic to protecting workers, consumers and the environment, critics of the Budget Office say. As one of many examples, a regulation that would force employers to measure the exposure of workers to a toxic chemical known to cause liver dmage, and to have the workers checked if exposed, was rejected by OMB as requiring too much paperwork.    And now, the regulators have new hope in their battle with OMB, thanks to recently proposed legislation and a case pending before the Supreme Court. At issue is whether OMB is exploiting its broad powers to review regulations as a way of stifling the agencies' efforts to impose regulations on business.    Right now, says David Vladeck, an attorney for Public Citizen, a Ralph Nader group, &quot;OMB exercises cradle-to-grave control over the administrative process, and used its power repeatedly to cut back on health and safety regulations by weakening regulations, delaying their issuance and, in some cases, forbidding an agency to take action.&quot;    OMB officials respond that they have an important role to play in the regulatory process, taking a broad policy approach, making sense of conflicting regulations, finding the &quot;least intrusive&quot; solutions and, of course, trimming the paperwork load for business.    OMB is working down its regulations backlog, and Jay Plager, head of OMB's office of information and regulatory affairs, says that he and his boss, OMB Director Richard Darman, have set &quot;a firm policy that (OMB) will not use delay as a weapon.&quot;    But advocacy groups, as well as many federal regulators, usually speaking privately, say that OMB actions have diluted, stalled or killed a long list of regulations.    For instance, they say, OMB held up an Environmental Protection Agency proposal to ban asbestos for five years, reasoning that future cancer deaths should be &quot;discounted&quot; and valued at as little as $22,094.93 today. EPA announced the ban in July, but David Doniger, an attorney with the National Resources Defense Council, charges that &quot;OMB is responsible for years of delay in action that would save thousands of American lives.&quot;    OMB has also blocked, in the name of paperwork reduction, an OSHA plan to require employers to measure their emissions of methylenedianiline, a chemical used in plastics and paints that has been shown to pose threats of cancer and liver damage, and to have workers examined for liver impairment from the chemical.    Among other regulations that critics say were stalled or blocked: OSHA rules to protect workers from dangerous dust in grain elevators, EPA efforts to curb factory air pollutants, and Food and Drug Administration attempts to require labeling of the relative absorbency of potentially deadly tampons and warnings of aspirin dangers for children with chicken pox or the flu.    Critics say OMB sabotages regulations by doing most of its work in secret, conferring with the regulated and raising almost endless questions about regulatory proposals. While the public participates in agency rule making, it has little say in OMB's behind-the-scenes activity, they add.    OMB's Mr. Plager responds that since 1986 OMB has moved to open up the process, placing in a public docket regulatory agencies' initial proposals, OMB actions that order further consideration or suspend review, and final documents resulting from OMB review. Contacts between OMB staff and private parties concerning a rule being reviewed are usually banned, he adds.    Nevertheless, Rep. John Conyers (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Government Operations Committee, is pushing changes to the Paperwork Act that would curb OMB's ability to undercut or delay regulations and require the agency to conduct much more of its review in public forums.    OMB, he says, is criticized for all too often acting &quot;like a cold-blooded accountant with little regard for the value of human life.&quot; Mr. Conyers is seeking to get OMB's fiscal 1990 appropriations held up until that legislative change is made.    Meanwhile, the Supreme Court this fall will hear a case that could have a heavy bearing on OMB's ability to use the paperwork law to review regulations. It involves an OSHA regulation that requires employers to tell workers what toxic chemicals they may have been exposed to.    The rule has had a tortuous and tortured history since an OSHA advisory committee recommended such a standard in 1974. After being issued in January 1981 under President Carter, the Reagan administration quickly withdrew it, OSHA drafted it again, OMB tried to block it in 1982, but it was issued in 1983.    In 1985 and again in 1987, with OMB trying to stop any expansion and unions suing, a federal court ordered OSHA to expand the standard beyond manufacturing, which OSHA finally did in August 1987. Then, in a paperwork review, OMB rejected several provisions of the rule.    OSHA bowed, suspending the rule, and the unions went to court again. A federal appeals court ordered the whole rule put into effect, saying, &quot;OMB cannot in the guise of reducing paperwork substitute its judgment for that of any agency having substantive rulemaking responsibility.&quot; The Reagan administration appealed to the Supreme Court.    Upholding the appeals court ruling &quot;would essentially put us out of business,&quot; says OMB's Mr. Plager. </TEXT></DOC>
