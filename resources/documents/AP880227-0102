The president's comments were only the latest in what is anincreasingly bulging file of eyebrow-raising statements he has madeat news conferences over the years. The gaffes have ranged fromerroneous economic statistics to misconstrued versions of eventsaround the world.   At Wednesday's session, Reagan remarked that Palestinian unrestin Israeli-occupied territory has been caused by ``outsiders comingin.''   It was followed quickly by a comment from Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz, who told reporters the conflict's ``fundamentalorigins are essentially indigenous.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the two answers were``totally consistent as far as we're concerned.''   The president also asserted that Shultz and former DefenseSecretary Caspar Weinberger had not objected to the secret armssale to Iran on the grounds that it was an arms-for-hostages deal.   Shultz and Weinberger have insisted that they did raise suchobjections, contentions supported by Congress' Iran-Contra reportand by a comment the president himself made a year ago.   And Reagan also spoke of divisions among blacks in white-ruledSouth Africa, stating, ``It is a tribal policy more than it is aracial policy, and that is one of the most difficult parts here.''   Fitzwater said he could not elaborate on the remark.   The confusion that trailed Reagan's comments echoed thediscrepancies that have emerged from many of the previous 41 newsconferences the president has held during his seven years in theWhite House.   At a June 11, 1987, news conference at the economic summit inVenice, Italy, the president sent his aides scrambling when hestated that he believed the dollar's value could decline further``within reason.''   The administration was trying to halt the dollar's slide at thetime, and Fitzwater quickly issued a statement denying that thepresident wanted the decline to resume.   ``He wants stability in the dollar,'' the spokesman said.   On Nov. 19, 1986, as the Iran-Contra affair was emerging, Reagantold reporters that the United States ``had nothing to do with''and ``did not condone'' arms shipments to Iran by third countries.   Soon after the news conference ended, White House officialsissued a statement conceding that a third country was involved inthe secret shipments. The country turned out to be Israel.   At that same news conference, Reagan said the TOW anti-tankmissiles included in the shipments to Iran are``shoulder-carried,'' when in fact they are much too large for thatand are normally fired from a jeep.   The president ignited a controversy June 11, 1986, when he saidthat if any Americans were starving or undernourished, it was fromignorance about where to get free food, not from lack of sustenance.   ``I find it difficult also to find any cases of starvation andundernourishment,'' he said.   Democrats criticized the president for terminating a programthat publicized the food stamp program. Rep. Leon Panetta,D-Calif., said there were hungry people ``a few blocks from theWhite House.''   On Feb. 18, 1982, Reagan offered an account of the early yearsof U.S. involvement in Vietnam. He stated that President Kennedyauthorized the sending of the first combat troops into Vietnam,which did not occur until President Johnson's administration.   Reagan also said North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh had``refused to participate'' in national elections after the Frenchwithdrawal from Indochina. In fact, the South Vietnamese governmentrefused to hold preparatory talks with North Vietnam, and documentsshowed that American diplomats urged the South Vietnamese to insiston conditions the Communists would not accept.   The elections were never held.   The Associated Press and other news organizations double-checkedcomments the president made at a Jan. 19, 1982, news conference,and challenged six statements.   Reagan said 1 million more people were at work than in 1980. Infact, there were 94,000 fewer people with jobs in December 1981than in December 1980, according to official government figures,and the White House later conceded that Reagan ``misspoke.''   Among other statements at that news conference, Reagan said:   _ The steel industry had commenced a multi-billion dollarexpansion program. Industry officials said there were plans tomodernize some factories, but that there were few proposals toexpand.   _ A Pima County, Ariz., program for feeding the elderly saved$50,000 by eliminating administrative help and doubled the peoplethey served. The program director denied that.   _ Interest rates had dropped during his year in office. Althoughsome short-term rates had fallen, rates on long-term governmentbonds _ the best indicator of long-term rates _ and home mortgagerates had increased.</TEXT></DOC>
