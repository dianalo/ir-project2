Price gains of small stocks generally outpaced those of larger issues for the second consecutive day.    The Nasdaq industrial index climbed almost 1%, or 3.18 points, to 358.12 yesterday; while the Dow Jones industrials, and the very largest Nasdaq stocks, barely budged. Nasdaq volume continued strong at 136 million shares.    Investors were buying small and medium-sized issues in nearly every industry group yesterday, concentrating on stocks that are still down significantly from the 1987 highs. Most popular, however, were stocks of the computer, medical technology, retailers and insurance companies groups, where buyers went for issues of all sizes.    Among the giant OTC issues, Apple Computer slid yesterday as did many of the largest Nasdaq stocks. It fell 7/8 to 43 3/4. Microsoft rose 1 1/2 to 58 1/2. Proportionately bigger gains showed up in slightly smaller stocks such as Apollo Computer, which rose 3/4 to 13 5/8.    Yesterday's market was led by depressed stocks that collapsed in price to half their year-earlier levels in October's crash. After last month's winter rally and the past three days of bull market buying, a few are already nearing pre-crash levels again.    Micro Mask, an electronics industry supplier, rose 1 1/4 to 8 1/4 yesterday. It was trading at 10 1/4 just before the crash, when it tumbled to 4 5/8. Ceradyne, a concern that makes ceramics for aerospace, rose 1 1/2 to 5 7/8. A year ago the issue traded at 13 a share.    Equally popular yesterday were pre-crash high fliers that took particularly steep nose dives in the crash. Old Cracker Barrel, a restaurant stock, had soared to 20 3/4 just before the crash from 12 1/4. Yesterday the issue rose 1/2 to 17 1/4. Among smaller issues, Offshore Logistics, which has more than doubled in price in the past year despite the crash, yesterday rose 1/4 to 2 1/2. DDI Pharmaceuticals had risen from 2 7/8 a year ago to 8 earlier in the year. Yesterday it climbed 1/2 to 3 3/8.    Some depressed small pharmaceutical stocks fared even better. Duramed Pharmaceuticals rose 1 1/4 to 4. The issue was at 8 7/8 a year ago. Chemex Pharmaceuticals rose 5/8 to 4 1/8.    Other depressed issues that leaped in price yesterday included: SAY Industries, a research and development firm working on industrial chemicals, up 1 to 4 1/8; Merrill Corp., a packaging concern, up 5/8 to 6 3/4; Service Merchandise, a catalog showroom retailer, up 1 to 5 1/4; MicroAge, a retailer, up 3/4 to 5 1/2; Applied Solar, which makes solar panels for satellites, up 1 to 5. Before yesterday, all were off at least 40% from their year-ago price.    One reason these small depressed issues take sudden one-day leaps in price, traders say, is that OTC brokerage firms are seeking out these very depressed stocks and then recommending them to customers. As clients pour into the issues, prices jump.    But price leaps in small OTC stocks often can signify nothing at all. Many of these issues don't trade very often, and as a result there is a big difference, or wide spread, between the price a market maker will pay for the shares (the lower, or bid price) and the price at which the market maker is willing to sell them (the higher, or ask price.) Price quotations for issues that trade on the National Market System show only the price of the last trade -- whether the market maker is buying at the lower price or selling at the higher one.    For example, Industrial Acoustics fell 1 to 6 1/2 yesterday. But the bid and ask prices from market makers remained constant at 6 1/2 bid, 8 asked. Only 100 shares of the issue traded, and they were purchased by a market maker at the lower bid price.    United Savings Bank of Virginia yesterday appeared to plummet 2 1/2 to 16 1/2. In fact, 600 shares traded at the 16 1/2 bid price; rather than the 19 1/2 ask price for the lightly-traded issue. </TEXT></DOC>
