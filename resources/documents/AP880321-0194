(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three former Du Pont Co. employeessuffering from exposure to asbestos pledged Monday to give 90percent of a $75 million award in punitive damages to sixinstitutions.   William Kapp Jr. of Elkton, Md., one of the victims andspokesman for the group, said the $67.5 million _ if the damageaward is upheld on appeal _ will be donated ``to try to help ourfellow asbestos victims, as well as to help assure that this kindof corporate abuse of public trust will never happen again.''   ``This is just our way of putting the punitive damages award toits highest purposes,'' Kapp said.   In November, a Superior Court jury awarded Kapp, 55; James Webb,74, of Newport; and Joseph Kaster, 71, of the Newport area andtheir wives what has been called the second-largest personal injuryaward in U.S. history, against Raymark Industries Inc. of Trumbull,Conn.   The jury supported claims that Raymark, formerly RaybestosManhattan Inc., conspired with the former Johns Manville Corp., nowManville Corp., to suppress information relating to the healthhazards of asbestos and failing to place warnings on their products.   Raymark manufactured asbestos that the men worked around formore than 25 years at Du Pont's Newport plant. Previous state courtrulings had barred liability of employers in such cases.   In addition to the punitive damage award, the men were awardedmore than $1 million in actual damages for personal injury. Theysaid they had contracted lung disorders linked to breathingasbestos fibers. Six co-defendants settled the case.   There are 350 similar cases pending against Raymark in Delaware.   The inhalation of asbestos, once commonly used in buildinginsulation and other products, has been linked to cancer and otherdiseases.   The National Campaign Against Toxic Hazards, a toxic victimsadvocacy group, was earmarked to receive $13 million of the $67.5million.   The Boston-based group's organizing director Peter Obstler saidthe money would be used ``to continue to provide staff andtechnical assistance to victims'' of toxic chemicals.   But Kapp stressed that the money may never be awarded.   Both sides are awaiting a decision from Judge Clarence W. Tayloron whether to uphold the award. If it is upheld, Raymark willappeal, according to LeGrande L. Young, Raymark general counsel.   Kapp, who employed by Du Pont for 33 years before he became tooill to work, said he was hoping the move to donate the money tocharity would persuade Taylor to uphold the $75 million award.   Young said he did not think the judge could be swayed. ``Eitherit's an appropriate judgment or it's not,'' he said.   The other institutions targeted for part of the award at $13million each are the Mount Sinai School of Environmental Medicinein New York; the University of Delaware School of Business toestablish a chair to advance the study of business ethics; theMedical Center of Delaware's Carpenter Clinic for Cancer Research;and the White Lung Association, a Baltimore-based organization ofasbestos victims.   An additional $2.5 million was pledged to the Emily P. BissellHospital for the critically ill in Newport.   The largest jury award is believed to be $127.8 million to anOrange County, Calif., teen-ager who sued Ford Motor Co. over burnshe received when the gasoline tank of his 1972 Pinto exploded.</TEXT></DOC>
