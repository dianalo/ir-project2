It has been demonstrated that the heat fusion technique, if properlyperformed, will result in a high quality pipe joint having no detectableflaws and with mechanical strength similar to that of the parent material.Bad joints can result from using defective equipment, improper joiningpractice, and adverse environmental conditions. Visual inspection hasbeen the main method to identify defective joints, but this is limitedto identifying external defects only. Detection methods for finding hiddenflaws, such as X-ray or ultrasonic techniques, have had major deficiencies.This has led to research in finding a practical flaw detection devicethat meets the needs of the gas industry. Performance requirements includeease of use, ability to detect small flaws and lack of bonding, and automatic,fast inspection and interpretation of joint quality. A field prototype,capable of detecting all known types of flaws in polyethylene pipe joints,has been developed. Development work is being completed and the new deviceis called Polyscann. Performance and design specifications for this deviceare presented; it uses focused ultrasonic transducers coupled acousticallyto the pipe by a liquid, is quick and easy to use, and is adaptable toa range of pipe sizes. The device includes an electronic control modulefor acquiring and processing data from the transducers, with a digitaluser interface.</TEXT></DOC>
