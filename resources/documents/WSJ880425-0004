Since court attacks have repeatedly failed to dislodge organized crime from its asserted domination of New York City's $200-million-a-year commercial garbage-hauling industry, the city hopes to muscle in on the mob's garbage game. Although the industry is already raising money to fight the plan, crime fighters hail it as an innovative Mafia-busting tactic.    The proposal: The city would be divided into districts for the collection of garbage from businesses and institutions. Competitive bidding would determine who received the franchises for each part of the city. And to keep the existing Mafia-inspired cartel from rigging the bids, the city would randomly bid against private contractors.    &quot;We want to break the grip that everybody believes organized crime has on the carting industry,&quot; Mayor Edward Koch has declared.    But the plan faces problems, including the cost to the city. Can the city underbid the mob to prevent collusion in the competition for the new franchises? Officials acknowledge that the city's labor cost per ton for collecting residential garbage exceeds the cost of the 400 private carters, who pick up 12,000 tons of garbage a day from nearly 80,000 commercial establishments.    Success with the innovative concept could prove significant. &quot;If the New York model works,&quot; says G. Robert Blakey, a Notre Dame University law professor and an authority on criminal justice, &quot;it could be used in other industries that traditionally have had unacceptable levels of mob influence.&quot;    The Mafia dominates the carting industry through links with some trade associations and its secret financial stake in some garbage companies, says James Kossler, a coordinating supervisor of the FBI's organized crime branch in New York.    &quot;Competitors are kept out, and carters' costs are kept down,&quot; says Mr. Kossler, who testified publicly in 1983 about one incident: A New York businessman got into the garbage-hauling business and quickly tried to grab customers from other carters by underbidding them. The businessman soon got a phone call from a gruff voice that said he wouldn't see his daughter again if he didn't get out. The voice &quot;described the clothes that the man's 10-year-old daughter was wearing,&quot; Mr. Kossler told the President's Commission on Organized Crime, &quot;and that she was standing on the corner of such-and-such street with a blue bicycle.&quot; Mr. Kossler added: &quot;The next day, he sold his trucks.&quot;    Jailings and cash fines aren't enough to end Mafia domination of a legitimate industry, says Ronald Goldstock, director of the New York State organized crime task force. Despite convictions and guilty pleas in a 1984 investigation in Long Island, Mr. Goldstock says that &quot;the anti-competitive behavior and racketeering still exist.&quot; He adds that the problem in carting won't be ameliorated unless there's structural change, such as competitive bidding and a public-benefit corporation that would randomly bid against private carters, &quot;so that no zone is free of competition.&quot;    The city's franchising and bidding idea is expected to be tested in Chinatown early next year. The private carting industry, denying the claims that it is Mafia dominated, is building a war chest to fight the plan. &quot;We informed the city we intend whatever legal action to enforce carters' rights,&quot; says Sid Davidoff, a New York attorney and spokesman for the Presidents' Council of Trade Waste Associations, which represents trade associations in the city's waste industry.    The plan's critics warn that the franchise proposal would shrink the industry, forcing dozens of small, family owned haulers out of business. Sonny Artuso, president of Century Waste Material Co., Brooklyn-based operator of two trucks, says he doesn't see how his company could compete for a franchise against companies with 40 or 50 trucks.    Whatever the reasons, large and small establishments currently seem to have little choice about who hauls away their garbage. The city's consumer affairs office licenses the private haulers and limits their charges for hauling commercial garbage to $10.66 a cubic yard -- a rate well above the $8 allowed in Chicago, for instance.    Enforcement is another matter, however, because the regulations make it difficult to terminate licenses. Many customers appear reluctant to register official protests. A major complaint: Carters avoid the maximum rate by exaggerating the amounts of garbage removed. The city's consumer-affairs office helped 75 aggrieved customers switch carters last year. But many who speak poor English -- especially recent arrivals from Asia -- feel helpless in dealing with the city bureaucracy. And some customers fear reprisals if they switch carters.    Even giant concerns are affected. Consolidated Edison Co. of New York, one of the nation's biggest utilities, says its garbage collector, Pandamp;F Trucking Inc., last year demanded renegotiation of its two-year contract -- long before it was due to expire. Whereupon, Con Edison says, it solicited bids from other carters, &quot;to see if we could get a lower price.&quot;    But nobody bid, Con Edison says. So, according to Con Edison, it granted Pandamp;F Trucking's demands. Pandamp;F says its garbage contract wasn't profitable without the price increase.    The United Nations, whose garbage bill is $42,000 a month, is served by National Carting Co., which won the pickup rights eight years ago. Last December, the U.N. didn't attempt to solicit bids. It simply extended its contract with National Carting. &quot;Soliciting bids in this particular industry is not the way to go,&quot; a U.N. spokesman says, implying that it is futile.    The Rev. Hosea Lee, executive director of the Korean Produce Association, which represents 1,300 New York-area shopkeepers, says switching carters won't change things. &quot;The new garbage collector will ask the same price that the customer previously paid,&quot; Mr. Lee says. &quot;Or the new collector will raise the price from the previous one.&quot;    A Korean-American shopkeeper on Manhattan's Lexington Avenue boycotted his garbage collector last November after the hauler, the storeowner says, demanded $350 a week, up from $250 a week.    &quot;I take my garbage to my brother-in-law,&quot; a Manhattan retailer, to dispose of it, the shopkeeper says. &quot;But my collector was watching me from the street. He called the company that collects my brother-in-law's garbage.&quot; That company, he says, wouldn't collect the excess garbage at his relative's shop. The shopkeeper says he ended his boycott after reaching a compromise on a price rise.    Manhattan's 14th Street shows how the city's new plan could shrink the industry, for better or worse. The street, extending across the width of Manhattan from East River to Hudson River, teems with small shops. By the city's estimate, 61 garbage companies now pick up 14th Street's commercial garbage. Under competitive bidding, the industry fears, the winning bidder could supplant the 61 carters. </TEXT></DOC>
