(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>DIGGING OUT FROM UNDER INFORMATION OVERLOADandM;Organizing and retrieving the information that lies buried in mountains ofarchived documents can be a nightmare for newspapers, magazines, small ormedium-sized libraries, and legal offices.andP;  Researchers looking forinformation on a particular topic may spend hours, even days, narrowing theirsearch to those references that appear in a meaningful context.andM;Although computers make it possible to access huge masses of data easily andreliably, most database software packages organize data in separate,inflexible compartments, making them ill-suited to the task of searchingthrough free-form text.andM;Recently, software vendors have addressed this need by offering databasepackages designed especially for users with heavy text-storage andtext-retrieval requirements.andM;One such package is Data Retrieval's SearchQuick, a complete text-retrievalpackage that provides speedy and flexible search capabilities and allowsusers to update the material in their on-line libraries quite easily.andM;We tested SearchQuick on a sample database created from files of old DR Labsreviews.andP;  Nineteen reviews--all stored as EDT text files in VMS--were used tocreate a database totaling more than 50,000 words.andP;  The text was organized as8,100 lines of about 40 characters per line.andM;We ran SearchQuick on a MicroVAX II with 16MB of memory and a 1.2GB CDC Sabredisk drive coupled to an Andromeda SMDC controller.andM;WHAT IT ISandM;SearchQuick is a menu-driven package the raison d'etre of which is to letusers store and search for text data quickly and conveniently.andM;It can accept documents and other text created by simple text editors, suchas EDT, as well as from any word processing system that can create plainASCII text files.andP;  Users can also enter text directly from their keyboards.andM;SearchQuick lets users select documents from a database according to thepresence or absence of a certain word or words (Fig.andP;  1).andP;  Each document alsohas formatted fields holding data that users can search to select documentsvia logical operations (equals, greater-than, less-than, etc.) on thecontents of those fields.andM;Once an initial search has been conducted on a user's database, SearchQuicklets users further narrow the field by searching that list of selecteddocuments for the presence of yet another word.andP;  Users can also conduct&quot;proximity&quot; searches, selecting all documents that have two user-specifiedwords located within a certain number of words of each other (Fig.andP;  2).andM;When each document is first added to a database, SearchQuick records all thedifferent words it contains (except such common words as &quot;the,&quot; &quot;an,&quot; and&quot;of.&quot;) and adds these to a search dictionary.andP;  Entries in this dictionarypoint to each document containing that specific word.andM;When SearchQuick searches for the occurrence of a specific word or words, itlooks in this search dictionary.andP;  This allows quicker searches than would bethe case with a &quot;brute force&quot; search of the entire text of every document inthe database.andP;  Only when searching for documents with two words in aspecified proximity to each other must SearchQuick search the documentcontents directly.andM;Each successful database search yields a result list of the documents meetingthe search criteria.andP;  Users can browse through this list on their screens,sort its contents according to several criteria, and select from a variety ofoptions to print the list itself or one or more documents from the list.andO;Users can also create reports on the results of a search in a customized,columnar format (Fig.andP;  3).andM;Each column in such a report records the contents of a formatted field ornamed section of the text, as specified by the user, for all documentssatisfying the search criteria.andP;  Reports can be viewed on the user's screenor printed.andP;  Once they have been created, report formats can be saved forlater use.andM;SearchQuick also lets users save their most frequently used search orreport-generating commands for later replay.andM;Another feature lets users export selected documents to VMS.andP;  These documentscan then be added to another SearchQuick database, provided that thedocuments in both databases use similar formatted fields.andP;  Exported fileshave the extension .EXP in their file names.andM;Each database can have an individually tailored interface suited to itsusers' particular needs.andP;  Just how much a particular database's interface iscustomized depends on the judgment and flexibility of the system manager.andO;Help menus and video screen displays can be tailored to suit the users of aparticular SearchQuick database.andM;SearchQuick's installation procedure is straightforward and painless.andP;  Thepackage makes use of DEC's standard VMSINSTAL command procedure.andM;Because SearchQuick makes extensive use of the PF and arrow keys of a VTterminal, users working on other types of terminals will have to call ontheir system manager to reset the software's command-key equivalents forthem.andM;Once the software has been installed, the system manager must establish thedatabases it will use.andP;  This is done through the Create New Database optionof the System Manager Main Menu.andM;User access to a database can be controlled in a number of ways.andP;  Forinstance, a particular database may or may not be set as &quot;open to the world.&quot;andM;Databases that are open to the world can be seen by anyone who can log in tothe VAX system.andP;  A world user--one whose username isn't defined toSearchQuick--can search an open database but can't make any changes.andM;Conversely, a database that isn't open to the world can only be accessed byusers whose usernames have been defined for SearchQuick.andP;  Each database hasits own list of authorized users.andM;The system manager can also set a minimum length for the passwords that willbe assigned to each user to access a particular database.andP;  Typically, eachuser will have a password unique to that database and that user.andP;  Assigning aminimum length of zero implies that the use of passwords for that database isoptional.andM;SearchQuick has three categories of user privileges: search, documentmaintenance and database administrator.andP;  To keep a user from adding ordeleting information from a database, the system manager can assign onlysearch privileges to that user's account.andM;SearchQuick users can be divided into 128 separate &quot;security groups.&quot;andP;  At thelowest level, Group 0 users can only access those documents with Group 0protection.andP;  Such documents are accessible to all SearchQuick users.andP;  At theother extreme is Group 127; documents with this protection can only beaccessed by Group 127 users, those with the highest privileges.andM;Access to documents with other group protections depends on whether usershave &quot;inclusive&quot; or &quot;exclusive&quot; access rights.andP;  Users with inclusive rightscan see documents in any security groups from 0 on up to their own.andP;  Userswith exclusive access can see only those documents in Group 0 or in their owngroup.andM;SearchQuick is distributed with a demonstration database, called States ofthe Union, that is designed to let users experiment with various searchcombinations.andP;  Users can browse through the result files generated by thesesearches to gain insight into how they should format the documents they willenter in their own databases.andM;OPEN SESAMEandM;Users start SearchQuick by entering the command SQ at the DCL prompt.andO;SearchQuick then prompts users for the code--usually an abbreviated name--forthe database they wish to access.andP;  Users can enter a question mark (?) to geta list of available database codes.andM;Users can access a database directly from the DCL prompt by putting its codeafter the SQ command.andP;  For example, entering the command SQ STATES at the DCLprompt would summon the demonstration database.andM;If a password has been assigned to that database, users must enter it afterentering the database code.andM;Once a user has entered a valid database code (and password, if there isone), SearchQuick displays information about that user's account and hisprinter code(s).andP;  Pressing the Return key brings the user to SearchQuick'smain menu.andM;From here the user can access the Search menu, the Document Maintenance menuor the Special Features menu.andP;  Only users with appropriate privileges canaccess the Document Maintenance menu.andM;Entering H at the main menu, or at most other SearchQuick screens, brings upa Help menu.andM;Each SearchQuick document has two parts; one contains the document's text orother free-form data and the other contains as many as 15 formatted fields.andO;Each document must have at least two formatted fields: one holding a uniqueidentifier for that document (XYZ123, for example), and another that holdsthe document's nameandM;Formatted fields allow for more efficient searching and sorting of documents.andO;Besides the two required fields, users can define formatted fields containingsuch data as the name of the document's author, the document's title or itspublication data.andP;  These fields can hold numeric data, alphanumeric dataor--in YYYY/MM/DD format--a data.andM;Similarly, text &quot;templates&quot; can be used to organize the free-form (text)portion of a document into a series of named sections.andP;  Templates create ageneric outline for each document and help prevent data-entry errors when thedocument's text is being entered or changed.andM;Assigning names to different sections of text also makes it easier to searchthe text and locate information.andP;  For example, rather than conducting asearch on the entire body of text in the database,  a user can limit a searchto named sections such as like Abstract or References.andP;  Users can also usethe section names to create columnar reports.andM;A default template can be created for each database so that, whenever newdocuments are added, SearchQuick will automatically supply that template.andO;Other templates can be substituted for the default, or users can type insection names as they go along.andP;  Templates can be changed, printed ordeleted.andM;DOCUMENT ENTRYandM;Once a database has been created from the system manager's account, documentscan be added to it from within a user's account if that user has documentmaintenance privileges (Fig.andP;  4).andM;To enter documents in an existing database, a privileged user can key thetext in manually or import an ASCII file or files from the VAX/VMSenvironment.andM;Each SearchQuick database has an In Box and Out Box where documents residewhile they are being prepared for insertion into that database.andM;The In Box is where users create and/or prepare a document for insertion.andO;Once a document is ready, the user moves it to the Out Box and schedules atime for insertion.andP;  At the scheduled time, the entire contents of the OutBox is added to the database.andM;Because SearchQuick must scan each document to add its words to the databasesearch dictionary--a time- and CPU-intensive process--Data Retrievalofficials recommend scheduling the insertion of documents for periods of lowuser activity.andM;In the In Box, users can enter text from the keyboard or import apre-existing document from VMS for a new SearchQuick document.andP;  To import anexisting VMS file, the user first must press andless;PF1andgt; G (PF1 being known as theGold key) to enter the andless;Goldandgt; GET command, then enter the name of the file toload it into the In Box.andM;andless;Goldandgt; GET is one of 40 commands from DEChs WPS-Plus word processing softwarethat SearchQuick recognizes.andM;SearchQuick's documentation contains an appendix illustrating how thesecommands are mapped to the VT terminal's numeric key-pad.andM;Once the user has finished typing or importing the free-form text of a newdocument, he or she is prompted to move it to the Out Box.andP;  At this point,the user can either start entering a new document or schedule the insertionof those documents already entered.andM;A log of insertion results lets users know if the insertion was successfuland records any problems that may have been encountered.andM;If the user's VMS text files have already been properly formatted, they canbe mass-loaded into a database by SearchQuick, circumventing the need to usethe In and Out boxes.andM;To load multiple documents, users select Document Insertion from the documentMaintenance menu.andP;  Here users can load one large VMS file containing all ofthe documents to be loaded into the database, or they can load a file thatlists all files (including the full VMS pathname of each from the users'top-level directory to be loaded.andM;The formatting needed to allow a document to be imported directly from VMSwill vary, depending on how the document will be loaded into the database.andM;If users choose to load multiple files at a time, each file must contain thetwo formatted fields that SearchQuick requires, as well as any other fieldsthat the database's other documents possess.andP;  If users are loading documentsinteractively--that is, one at a time--they can establish the formattedfields for each document as it is being loaded.andM;The pre-formatting required to load files en masse means that users mustspend some time editing files before they can be entered.andP;  Thus, users mustweigh the time needed to edit each file against the time it would take toenter the files individually using SearchQuick's In and Out boxes.andM;Each time a document is inserted into a database, the search dictionary isupdated (or created, if the database had been empty).andP;  Frequently used wordssuch as conjunctions, articles and prepositions are omitted from thisdictionary and are placed on a &quot;stop word&quot; list.andP;  Words in this latter listcannot be searched for.andP;  The database administrator can add and delete wordsfrom this list.andM;SearchQuick's dictionary modifies words in order to speed up the searchprocess while preserving word meaning.andP;  Spaces or tabs are considered worddelimiters.andP;  No word can be longer than 28 characters.andP;  Only uppercaseletters are used in the search dictionary; thus, searches are notcase-sensitive.andP;  Punctuation is preserved only at the very end of a word.andM;A question mark (?) can be used as a metacharacter to preview variations of aword that are present in the database.andP;  For example, entering COMP? at theSearch menu would generate a list of all words in the search dictionarystarting with the letters COMP, as well as the number of documents containingeach word.andM;Users can narrow the result list by using logical connectives between words.andO;For example, typing COMPUTER at the Search menu generates a result list ofall documents with that word.andP;  If the user then types AND CPU, a smaller listresults.andP;  The first result list is used as input for the search on CPU,rather than the entire database being used.andP;  If use of the word AND wereomitted from the example just given, SearchQuick would have located allinstances of CPU in the entire database.andP;  (Users could also type COMPUTER ANDCOMP as one line.)andM;SearchQuick uses the standard logical connectors: AND, OR, NOT and XOR.andM;The program reads these connectors from left to right.andP;  AND will allow onlythose documents satisfying the first half of the condition to be searched forthe second; OR returns the selection process back to the entire database.andO;XOR is exclusive; that is, only one half of the condition can be true.andM;Searching by formatted fields results in the selection of documents thatcomply with the comparisons and ranges set by the user.andP;  This kind of searchignores the free-form text.andM;Every formatted field search command must contain the field-name to besearched against, the operator for comparison and some literal value insingle quotes.andP;  The usual relational operators can be used: = or EQ, andless;andgt; orNE, andless; or LT, andless;= or LE, andgt; or GT, andgt;= or GE, and HAS, which tests for a literalstring within the field value.andM;Frequently, a search session results in an empty result list.andP;  This oftenoccurs when the user is unfamiliar with the contents of the database.andP;  Whenthis happens, users can use SearchQuick's Recall option, which brings up theprevious screen, to recall the previous result list or the previous command.andM;In addition to using the Browse menu to view each document in the resultlist, users can print the list, sort it or produce a report.andP;  The Browse menuoffers a Print option that lets users print either the list of documents in aresult list or the documents themselves.andM;Sorting is based on the formatted fields, and documents can be sorted inascending or descending order.andP;  Users can back out of a sort at any time.andM;Users can also produce and print customized columnar reports.andP;  Users can sendsuch print jobs to a shared printer or to a printer dedicated to theirparticular terminal.andM;SearchQuick provides a &quot;learn&quot; mode designed to help users recall frequentlyused search command sequences.andP;  Each learn session has a unique name for thatdatabase and user.andM;SearchQuick &quot;learns&quot; a command sequence the first time a user executes it,then lets the user replay that sequence at any time.andM;SearchQuick can pause while replaying a sequence so users can input uniquedata.andP;  For example, users might want to search for a different username eachtime they replay a command sequence.andP;  Before ending their SearchQuicksession, users have the option of extracting the learn file they've createdand storing it as a VMS text file for future reference.andM;By far the most useful tool for maintaining any database is the ability totrack who accesses which databases, as well as when and how often they do so.andO;This information, in combination with a good analysis package, can helpsystem managers fine-tune a database system for maximum performance.andM;Information on user activity in SearchQuick is stored in three files:DBACCT.LIS, DBACCT.DAT and DBACCT.LOG.andM;DBACCT.LIS is an accounting report for each database; it provides a completerecord of all SearchQuick usage from the time the software was firstinstalled.andM;DBACCT.DAT is an active session log file that grows with the number of users.andM;The DBACCT.LOG file is created when the system manager disables sessionlogging.andP;  It is an accumulation of all statistics recorded in DBACCT.DATprior to session logging being disabled, which can then be fed into ananalysis or spreadsheet program.andM;We created two identical copies of DR Labs' test database.andP;  The first wecreated interactively within SearchQuick's Add/Change/Delete Document menu.andO;This method was time-consuming but avoided having to format each fileindividually before loading them all.andP;  We created the second copy usingSearchQuick's mass-loading procedures.andP;  Each VMS file had to be edited toinclude the formatted fields that our database included.andM;YOU HAVE A CHOICEandM;To test SearchQuick, there are two choices in loading documents en masse:mass-load input and mass-load command.andP;  The former method takes just about aslong as loading documents interactively.andP;  The latter uses a command filelisting the documents to be loaded and is probably more efficient for userswho must enter the same files frequently.andP;  We used this latter method to loadthe second copy of our test database and found it to be very convenient.andM;We used SearchQuick's session-logging feature to record the times required byeach of our test searches of the database.andP;  (See &quot;Test Results,&quot; page 38.)andO;With session logging enabled, SearchQuick recorded such statistics as theelapsed time and CPU time for each search in its DBACCT.DAT file.andM;To use this log, we had to execute our test search, exit SearchQuick, enterthe system manager account and view the DBACCT.DAT file.andP;  This process wasrepeated for each test search.andP;  All of these times include the time requiredto enter and exit SearchQuick itself--a process that takes 5 seconds ofelapsed time and 0.12 seconds of CPU time.andM;Once the test was completed, we entered the system manager account andprinted out the DBACCT.DAT file.andM;We found SearchQuick to be extremely fast in searching for individual wordsand in searching formatted fields.andP;  The search dictionary accelerates wordsearches and makes the software much more efficient.andP;  Proximity searches,which must search the actual documents of a result list, took two to threetimes longer in elapsed time and used 10 to 12 times more CPU time.andM;We were also impressed by the variety of options that SearchQuick provides.andO;The menu-driven scheme for browsing through documents, sorting them andprinting them was easy to implement.andP;  We also found it easy to create scriptsof frequently repeated commands, and archiving these scripts in a directorymade it very convenient to use these scripts again and again.andM;Creating and maintaining a SearchQuick database is quite easy: Thedocumentation is clear and complete, the menus are user-friendly, and a helpfeature is available on-line.andM;Data Retrieval does offer installation, training, database design anddatabase conversion support based on regular consulting fees.andP;  However, wefound these services largely unnecessary when working with the product.andP;  Withone exception--when inserting documents from VMS interactively--we found allthe information needed to create and maintain a database right in thesoftware's manuals.andM;Although we rarely needed to call Data Retrieval's support team, we foundthem helpful and technically sound when we did call.andM;This user-friendly, menu-driven text database package can be a godsend tousers needing to search through mountains of text quickly and accurately forthose essential facts buried within.andP;  And SearchQuick's straightforwarddesign and simple interface make it a good choice for users with only limitedcomputer experience.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
