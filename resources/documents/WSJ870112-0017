They also agreed to a 2% upward revaluation of the Belgian and Luxembourg francs. The French franc was left unchanged, as were the other currencies that participate in the joint float: the Italian lira, Danish krone and Irish punt.    The news came after more than 10 hours of difficult negotiations among the ministers of the Common Market member states and their central bank governors, in which Danish demands for a revaluation of the krone were strongly resisted and finally rejected by the other member states. The others argued that economic fundamentals didn't justify such a move.    The realignment appears to be a victory for the French and a concession by Germany. For weeks, as a declining dollar and French political turmoil forced the mark higher and the franc lower, the French tried to avoid a devaluation of the franc by forcing some action from Germany that would ease the EMS strains. The German government, meanwhile, was said to be concerned that an upward revaluation of the mark, which will hurt the competitiveness of German exports by making them more expensive in other markets, would cost the ruling party votes if it came before the Jan. 25 national election.    Although the realignment appeared smaller than some in the foreign-exchange market had expected last week, ministers said after the meeting that they expected the accord will be accepted by the market. &quot;The deutsche mark parity appears to correspond to the realities of the market,&quot; said French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur. German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the decision is a &quot;clear signal&quot; that should ensure that speculative capital flows back from Germany to its countries of origin.    Mr. Stoltenberg said the decision to revalue the currencies upward wasn't caused by economic factors but was a response to recent speculation. Mr. Balladur stressed that the currency changes wouldn't alter French economic policy.    The weekend discussions were preceded by intensive and confidential talks between Mr. Stoltenberg and Mr. Balladur. According to German monetary sources, the two countries decided to end the weeklong bout of mutual recrimination over who was responsible for the latest crisis in the EMS in the belief that Europe must present a united front to the U.S.    &quot;This is a small story compared with the threat of U.S. protectionism and the uncertainty as to what will happen to the dollar as the U.S. becomes more of a debtor country,&quot; said one German monetary official before the weekend talks began.    The dollar may get a short-term boost from the EMS realignment, as speculative selling of dollars for marks in anticipation of a revaluation of the German currency will end, and some funds likely will be attracted once again to the relatively high interest rates that dollar investments offer.    However, strong bearish sentiment still surrounds the dollar in the longer term, based on concern about a sluggish U.S. economy, a persistent large trade deficit and the recent political turmoil surrounding U.S. arms sales to Iran.    In Tokyo trading today following the realignment, the dollar was moving narrowly in a calm market.    On Friday, the dollar was strengthened by European central-bank efforts to keep several currencies from falling below their lowest permissible levels in the EMS against the mark. Some of the marks sold in such operations are used to buy dollars, supporting the U.S. currency. In addition, the Bank of Japan was actively supporting the dollar amid concern that a weaker yen would further damage the Japanese economy.    Despite the heavy central bank intervention last week and moves in several EMS countries to raise interest rates, the French franc ended last week at its EMS floor against the mark. Under the EMS mechanism, seven of the currencies may not move against one another by more than 2.25% above or below agreed-upon central rates. The eighth currency, the Italian lira, is permitted a 6% band.    A country is obligated to intervene in the foreign-exchange market to keep its currency within the bands. It can also raise or lower interest rates to help stay within the bands; interest-rate revisions alter a currency's attractiveness by increasing or reducing the returns on investments in that currency. If those measures fail, a nation can request a realignment of the currencies.    A devaluation of the franc would have been considered an unfavorable comment on the French government's economic policies, which the French consider unjustified. Conservative Prime Minister Jacques Chirac already is under fire following recent student protests and labor strikes. A devaluation also could have increased inflationary expectations at the same time the government is struggling to keep wage increases under control.    The increase in the mark's value will help slow German monetary growth by shutting off the recent speculative investment in the mark in anticipation of a revaluation. German officials have voiced persistent concern about the possible inflationary impact of continued above-target monetary growth.    But a stronger mark may prove unpopular in Germany because it will make the country's exports less competitive. German farmers are said to be particularly sensitive to such a development, and the government was said to be reluctant to risk losing their votes by acting before the election.    So, early on Saturday afternoon, the German government moved to persuade the electorate that a revaluation was, in fact, a sign of strength. Government spokesman Friedhelm Ost issued a statement asserting that Germany is &quot;world champion&quot; in terms of price stability and that the mark is the world's &quot;strongest currency.&quot;    &quot;All citizens profit from this,&quot; Mr. Ost said.    Last April, the mark's value was raised 3% and the franc's lowered 3%.    Because of the recent massive flow of funds out of the weak dollar into the mark, some analysts are skeptical that the revaluation of the mark will be sufficient to maintain calm in the EMS for long.    &quot;The market could veto the realignment, in which case we'll be back here again in four to five months' time,&quot; said Geoffrey Dennis, international economist of a London stockbrokerage, James Capel andamp; Co. &quot;In the long run, the best solution for the EMS is to get German interest rates down,&quot; he added.    Other economists predicted that West Germany will have to enter a currency-stabilization pact, similar to that apparently agreed to by the U.S. and Japan last autumn, to make the latest EMS realignment stick.    In late New York trading Friday, the dollar stood at 1.9180 marks, up from 1.9145 Thursday. The dollar also firmed to 158.33 yen from 157.62.    In Europe, several central banks intervened to prevent their currencies from falling through their EMS floors against the mark. The French franc, Irish punt and Danish krone remained under pressure. &quot;The support of the weaker European currencies tends to help hold up the dollar,&quot; said James S. Vick, vice president and senior corporate trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York.    The West German central bank also sold marks to buy dollars, traders said.    At the Paris foreign-exchange fixing Friday, the Bank of France sold about 250 million marks to hold the West German unit at its EMS ceiling for the third straight day. Traders noted that the amount was substantially greater than the 130 million marks sold at Thursday's official price-setting.    At the Frankfurt fixing, the Bundesbank also increased its French-currency purchases to 1.03 billion francs from 179 million Thursday. The French and West German central banks intervened in European interbank markets as well.    News that the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 6.7% last month from 6.9% in November had little effect on the dollar Friday, dealers said.    The timing of the Bank of Japan's massive intervention supporting the dollar Friday baffled some currency dealers. With attention focused on EMS-related activity and European central-bank intervention, some traders said the dollar appeared somewhat stable against the yen.    &quot;It didn't look as if it was going in a dramatic plunge,&quot; said Richard Witten, vice president of foreign exchange at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., New York. He said it was possible that the Bank of Japan &quot;staked out&quot; the 158-yen level as &quot;territory&quot; to defend.    Last week, Japanese officials stepped up their statements about the negative impact that the weak dollar had on Japan's exports.    ---                      CURRENCY RATES                        New York   Home Mkt.
