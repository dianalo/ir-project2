Most of the helium comes from nucleosynthesis in the Big Bang, whichalso produced traces of D, {sup 3}He and {sup 7}Li, while the remaindercan largely be accounted for by synthesis in stars and subsequent ejectioninto the interstellar medium in the form of supernova ejecta, planetarynebulae and stellar winds. Information about these processes can be obtainedon the one hand by theoretical computations and observations of starsin advanced stages of evolution and on the other by studying the distributionof detectable elements in different parts of different galaxies and indifferent stellar populations. Some observational results bearing onthe extrapolation of observed abundances back to the Big Bang, and onthe evolution of galaxies, are described.</TEXT></DOC>
