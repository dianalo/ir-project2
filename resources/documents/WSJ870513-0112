But in a separate action that attracted almost no notice, the very same members of Congress unanimously agreed that the Soviets already have broken the ABM accord.    By a vote of 418-0, the House Thursday resolved: &quot;It is the sense of the Congress that the Soviet Union is in violation of its legal obligations under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.&quot;    The resolution, offered by freshman Rep. Curt Weldon (R., Penn.), focused specifically on the Soviet Union's ABM radar at Krasnoyarsk. It noted that the ABM treaty prohibits early-warning radars except along the periphery of a nation's territory and only if they are oriented outward, and also bans deployment of an ABM system to defend national territory. (Only one ABM site, either covering a missile field or the nation's capital, is permitted under the accord.)    The House then went on to recognize that the Krasnoyarsk radar is &quot;for ballistic missile early warning and tracking&quot; and is &quot;not directed outward but instead faces the northeast Soviet border more than 4,500 kilometers away.&quot; It also said that the radar is &quot;ideally situated to fill the gap that would otherwise exist in a nationwide Soviet ballistic-missile early-warning radar network.&quot; The House further accepted President Reagan's certification that Krasnoyarsk is &quot;an unequivocal violation&quot; of the ABM treaty.    House liberals and conservatives, SDI opponents and proponents, arms controllers and arms-control doubters are now jointly on record as finding that the Soviet Union is in violation of its &quot;legal obligation&quot; under the ABM treaty. No one any longer accepts the Kremlin's propaganda that the Krasnoyarsk radar is merely for spacecraft tracking. It is, rather, part of a developing Soviet ABM network.    The Senate now has an obligation to address a similar resolution on the Krasnoyarsk radar. It was, after all, the Senate and not the House that ratified the ABM treaty in the first place. It is, therefore, the Senate's responsibility to determine whether the Soviets are complying with its provisions, instead of arguing about legalistic &quot;narrow&quot; or &quot;broad&quot; interpretations of the ABM negotiating record. </TEXT></DOC>
