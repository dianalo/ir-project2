The documents filed in U.S. District Court here contain the mostdetailed charges yet against the deposed Philippine leader and hiswife, Imelda, said plaintiff's attorney Ronald L. Olsen.   But Marcos attorney John Bartko said Thursday the filing, whichamended a 3-year-old lawsuit by the Philippine government seeking$50 billion in damages from the Marcoses, was just a rehash of oldallegations.   He characterized Wednesday's action as a publicity stunt at atime when Marcos is near death. Marcos was in very critical andunstable condition Thursday at St. Francis Medical Center inHonolulu.   ``It doesn't make any sense to include old material at a timelike this,'' Bartko said. ``Everybody knows Marcos is likely to diein the near future.''   Marcos, president of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986, and hiswife plundered property and money by ``diverting foreign economicassistance to which the Philippine government was entitled, andextorting, soliciting and accepting bribes, kickbacks, illicitgratuities and commissions'' in exchange for favors, the amendedlawsuit said.   During that time, Marcos claimed average after-tax earnings ofabout $50,000 a year.   Programs tapped by the Marcoses included the U.S. EconomicSupport Fund, Japanese war reparations and Japan's Overseas EconomicCooperation Fund, the lawsuit said.   The lawsuit also claims the Marcoses:   _ Received more than $53 million in kickbacks on contracts withat least seven Japanese companies.   _ In 1973 diverted to their personal use 800,000 troy ounces ofgold from Philippine Central Bank reserves.   _ Converted to their personal use more than $27 million from thePhilippine National Bank and bought more than 52 million pesos worthof items at Philippine duty-free shops, thus avoiding substantialtaxes.   The lawsuit said that the couple, either by themselves or throughothers' help, maintained 58 bank accounts in Los Angeles, BeverlyHills, Calif.; San Francisco and New York to shelter their gains.   According to the lawsuit, the accounts were rarely in the name ofthe Marcoses, who operated behind ``nominees and surrogates orthrough multiple layers of offshore and onshore entities organizedprincipally in the Netherlands Antilles, Panama, the Cayman Islands,Hong Kong and the United States.''   The Marcoses have been hit with more than 40 lawsuits, includinga criminal lawsuit filed by the U.S. government in New York andseveral cases in the Philippines.   Bartko contends there is only one significant lawsuit: the one inNew York. ``And, hopefully, it will be decided on the evidence,'' hesaid.   The nine defendants in the Los Angeles case include the Marcoses,Saudi Arabian millionaire Adnan Khashoggi, now living inSwitzerland, and Roberto D. Benedicto, a Marcos associate who is afugitive from federal charges in New York stemming from many of thesame allegations outlined in this lawsuit.   Other defendants are the California Overseas Bank in Los Angelesand the Redwood Bank in San Francisco, which were allegedlycontrolled by Marcos and his associates; and three offshorecompanies, Krodos Properties, N.V., of the Netherlands Antilles, AlDjebel Corp. of the Cayman Islands and Lei Investments Ltd. of theChannel Islands.</TEXT></DOC>
