SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Pentagon on Friday lifted its suspension ofa division of Teledyne Industries Inc. after the firm reimbursed thegovernment and acted to prevent a recurrence of wrongdoingdiscovered in the ``Ill Wind'' probe of defense contract fraud.   Larry J. Wilson, a spokesman for the Defense Logistics Agency,said the lifting of the suspension against Teledyne Electronics Co.of Newbury Park, Calif., meant it could again do business with thegovernment.   ``The action took effect today,'' Wilson said.   The suspension was imposed in January when the parent company wasindicted. The indictments were based on allegations of wrongdoing byTeledyne Electronics, three of its then-current employees and oneformer employee.   Teledyne Industries Inc. and three of the individuals weresubsequently convicted, the Pentagon statement said.   On March 23, Teledyne and a Navy official pled guilty to chargesstemming from the ``Ill Wind'' procurement probe, with the Navy manadmitting he took a bribe to provide inside information on acontract.   The suspended Navy official, Stuart E. Berlin, agreed tocooperate with prosecutors in the investigation.   For its part, Teledyne agreed to pay $4.5 million in penaltiesand to satisfy other claims in the case.   Wilson said the firm had reimbursed the government ``for thefinancial loss suffered as a result of Teledyne Electronics'wrongdoing. Among other things, it paid more than $2 million incivil penalties, $1.5 million in criminal penalties, and had paidthe department's administrative costs for the probe, Wilson said.   The company had also taken steps to protect the government frombusiness dealings with the individuals responsible for thewrongdoing and had also instituted internal controls _ such as anethics program _ ``to protect against a recurrence,'' said thestatement.   According to fiscal 1987 figures, the latest available, theparent Teledyne Inc. is the nation's 46th largest defensecontractor, receiving $359.4 million in Pentagon business.   Federal prosecutors said their investigation focused onallegations that private consultants bribed government employees forinformation that gave client companies an edge in winning contracts.   The indictments focused on activities alleged to have beenundertaken by Teledyne Electronics, Navy procurement specialistStuart E. Berlin and private consultants Fred H. Lackner and WilliamL. Parkin.   Specifically, the indictment charged that Teledyne and three ofits officers agreed to pay Parkin $160,000 to assist them inobtaining a Navy contract related to radar worth $100 million.   To obtain the contract, the indictment contended Parkin paidLackner, a California-based private consultant, who ``in turn paidStuart E. Berlin ... for his assistance in manipulating theprocurement process to insure that the ... contract was awarded toTeledyne.''   Berkley Baker, a spokesman for Teledyne, said at the time of thesuspension that the company's electronics division ``accounts forabout 2 percent of our annual revenues, or in the $75 millionrange.''</TEXT></DOC>
