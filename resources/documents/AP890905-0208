The two firms had hoped to reach a merger agreement by early thismonth. On July 6, Chicago-based Andersen and New York-based PriceWaterhouse announced that they had entered into 60 days of formaltalks to explore the feasibility of a merger.   In a statement released today, Price Waterhouse Chairman JosephE. Connor and Andersen Chief Executive Lawrence A. Weinbach said``the initial period of discussion has been beneficial'' and the``exploratory merger discussions are continuing.''   They said partners at both firms' offices around the world wereparticipating in task forces to make recommendations on the proposedmerger.   The executives said the discussions so far ``have concentrated onexploring a combination that would add value to client service,capitalize on shared values of commitment to quality ... and provideenhanced opportunities to personnel of both firms.''   But the statement said both firms would have no public comment ondetails of the merger discussions because of confidentialityagreements.   Industry observers say the talks between Andersen and PriceWaterhouse have run into some obstacles, including how to deal withAndersen's rapidly growing consulting business, the ChicagoSun-Times reported in today's editions.   But the firms apparently are resolved to deal with the problemsso as not to lag behind other major accounting firms which aretrying to complete mergers.   ``A lot of Andersen consultants don't want to do it, but I thinkit's going to go through anyway,'' said Arthur Bowman, publisher ofBowman's Accounting Report in Atlanta.   The merger of Arthur Andersen and Price Waterhouse is also ``notjust a U.S. issue, and that may be one of the reasons for theslowness of the decision,'' Joel Portugal, a consultant who hasworked with both firms, told the New York Times.   Another potential problem is IBM's relationship with bothAndersen and Price Waterhouse.   IBM is Price Waterhouse's largest audit client, worth millions ofdollars in fees a year to the firm. The giant computer maker is alsoinvolved in dozens of joint-venture partnerships with AndersenConsulting to develop computer integration projects for clients.   But federal Securities and Exchange Commission rules bar anaccounting firm from participating in joint ventures with auditclients because of possible conflicts of interest.   ``If they move forward, there's the potential something big couldbe lost,'' James Emerson, publisher of Emerson's ProfessionalService Review in Bellevue, Wash., told the Sun-Times.</TEXT></DOC>
