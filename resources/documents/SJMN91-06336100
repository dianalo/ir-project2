It'sa good, easy, simple way for women to do their own hair at home,&quot; Sorbiesays.;   &quot;Most women nowadays tend to have a wash-and-wear hairstyle due tolack of time, but if they just used heated rollers, they'd get an alternativelook, a more dressy look.&quot;;   Sorbie suggests a look for women with long hair.&quot;Set their hair in heated rollers, take it all up and twist it from the backup to the crown in a French twist and secure it, having a bunch of curls onthe top,&quot; he says. &quot;It has a '60s feeling.&quot;;   Accessories also help women&quot;bump up&quot; a hairstyle, as Sorbie puts it. &quot;A headband worn at the front of thehairline area immediately makes a hairstyle look away from usual. Or colorfulclips, and there's loads of them on the market, can bump it up to a partylook. If you have longer hair, take the back into a low ponytail at the napeof the neck and tie one of those lovely big elastic bands in velvet or goldribbons.&quot;;   Long hair is easier to change, but Sorbie says women with shorthair shouldn't give up. &quot;With really short hair, it's difficult to make itlook different, but the ultimate fashion accessory is to wear a wig or falsepiece of hair, which is very fashionable. A lot of the models on catwalks arewearing wigs and falls.;   &quot;My wife has really short hair, and I bought her ahalf-wig that sits on the back of her head. We put a headband over the joiningof her hairline and the wig, and it looks like her hair is long. It is a very,very believable illusion of creating longer hair and ideal for someone withreally short hair that can't think of anything to do with it.&quot;;   Sorbie hashis share of celebrity clients, including Sting, Julie Christie, GeorgeHarrison and Zandra Rhodes. Although he's based in London six months of eachyear, the only royal head he's coiffured is Lord Snowden's, and he says he hasno desire to lay hands on the locks of Princess Diana.;   &quot;Whoever is doingher hair is doing a good job. I don't aim myself at that side. I've found inhairdressing, it's more interesting working on people in everyday life thanthe rich and famous. Invariably they're a pain, to be honest.&quot;;   Sorbie, 42,has been in the business for 27 years. Five years ago he launched hishair-product line in the United States, selling it in May 1990 to Redken.Sorbie has stayed on as a consultant and now spends half of each yeartraveling to promote and educate stylists.;   This holiday season, salonscarrying his line are selling a  &quot;Seasons Greenings&quot; gift pack of shampoo,conditioner, liquid gel, hair spray and a package of pine-tree seeds in arecycled paper package priced around $7.; STYLE EVENTS; MARILYN LOOKS:  Aselection of dresses Bill Travilla designed for Marilyn Monroe to wear in herfilms, including &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; and &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl's BestFriend,&quot; will be on display along with current holiday selections from theTravilla collection from Thursday through Dec. 8 at Saks Fifth Avenue,Stanford Shopping Center, Palo Alto.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mary Gottschalk column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911201  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3L  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  647  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, December 1, 199100336100,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
