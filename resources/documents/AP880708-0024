The measure, sent to the White House on Thursday following 91-3approval by the Senate, is the first regular appropriations billfor the coming fiscal year to clear Congress.   For the past two years, lawmakers have rolled the 13 regularbills into huge omnibus packages called continuing resolutions.   If the energy and water legislation is signed by Reagan, itwould be the first regular spending bill to get a presidentialsignature since December 1985.   The bill is expected to get his approval. It is one of the fewfiscal 1989 appropriations bills wending their way through Congressthat has not drawn a veto threat.   The legislation is a hold-the-line plan containing few newinitiatives and, lawmakers say, not one dime to allow the ArmyCorps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation to begin building anynew dams, harbor and irrigation projects next year.   Another casualty is the superconducting super collider, whichwas refused the $350 million the administration sought to begin itsconstruction. Instead, Congress voted $100 million for morepreliminary planning for the high-energy physics research project.   Leaders of the House and Senate appropriations committees saidthe next president should make the decision on whether to committhe nation to building the multibillion-dollar project.   The legislation would give the corps $11 million less in fiscal1989, which begins next Oct. 1, than it is now getting. The bureauwould get $40 million more. Both agencies would have money tocontinue work on more than 200 existing construction projects, butat a slower pace in a number of cases.   The Energy Department would get about two-thirds of the $17.83billion, with $8.1 billion earmarked for the nuclear activities itconducts on behalf of the Department of Defense.   There is $3 million in the bill to bolster federal research intothe ``greenhouse effect,'' which some scientists say is a dangerousglobal warming trend caused by mankind's overloading the atmospherewith gases like carbon and fluorocarbons.</TEXT></DOC>
