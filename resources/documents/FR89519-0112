Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms and Substanceof the Proposed Rules Changes</ITAG>The proposed rules changes would modify GSCC's Rules as stated in sectionII A.<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rules Changes</ITAG>In its filing with the Commission, GSCC included statements concerningthe purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rules changes and discussedany comments it received on the proposed rules changes. The text of thesestatements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. GSCChas prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,of the most significant aspects of such statements.A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and StatutoryBasis for, the Proposed Rule Change(a) The purpose of the proposed rules changes is, in conjunction with otherrules changes that will be filed for Commission approval in the near future,to establish the legal framework for the Netting System that GSCC plansto implement to provide a netting service for certain of its members.Current Rule 2 (Members) would be revised to establish three distinct categoriesof members: members of the Comparison System (defined as ``Comparison-OnlyMembers''), members of both the Comparison System and the Netting System(defined as ``Netting Members''), and Clearing Agent Bank Members. A personwould qualify to apply to become a Comparison-Only Member if it is (1)A broker or dealer that has registered or given notice under the GovernmentSecurities Act of 1986, (2) a clearing agent bank that is obligated toGSCC on behalf of a non-member, or (3) any other entity that demonstratesto the Board that its business and capabilities are such that it couldreasonably expect material benefit from direct access to GSCC's services.A person would qualify to apply to become a Netting Member if it satisfiedthe requirements of either category (1) or category (2) above and, at thetime of becoming a member of the Netting System, it will have been a Comparison-OnlyMember for at least six months, unless this requirement is waived by theGSCC Board. Any clearing agent bank_defined to mean a member of the FederalReserve System that is regularly engaged in the business of providing Governmentsecurities clearance services to GSCC members and that will, upon GSCC'srequest and under mutually agreeable terms, provide clearing services toGSCC_is eligible to apply to become a Clearing Agent Bank Member. OnlyComparison-Only and Netting Members would be entitled to participate inthe Comparison System service, and only Netting Members would be entitledto participate in the Netting System service.The proposed revisions to Rule 2 further provide that an application tobecome any type of member would first be reviewed by the Membership andStandards Committee, which would recommend approval or disapproval of theapplication to the full GSCC Board. The Board would approve a membershipapplication only upon a determination that the applicant meets the standardsof financial responsibility and operational capability set forth in thenew Rule 15. Comparison-Only Members and Netting Members would be requiredto give at least ten days' written notice to GSCC before electing to terminatetheir membership.New Rule 15 (Financial Responsibility and Operational Capability Standards)provides identical financial responsibility and operational capabilitystandards for applicants to become Comparison-Only Members and ClearingAgent Bank Members. Such applicants must: (1) Have satisfactory operationalcapability, personnel, accounting systems, and internal procedures to sufficientlyhandle transactions and communicate with GSCC as may be required, (2) beable to make any anticipated fee payments, (3) be in compliance with theminimum capital requirements of their designated examining authority orappropriate regulatory agency, (4) not be subject to an order of statutorydisqualification or an order of similar effect issued by a banking authority,and (5) not have triggered one or more disqualification criteria_includingthe applicant being subject to a condition that would require it to beplaced on surveillance status if it were already a member (The conditionsunder which a member will be placed on surveillance status by GSCC willbe set forth in GSCC Rule 4 (Clearing Fund and Loss Allocation), whichwill be filed with the Commission for its approval in the near future).Admission to become a Netting Member would require a Board determinationthat the applicant: (1) Continues to meet the requirements for admissionas a Comparison-Only Member, (2) will have sufficient financial abilityto make anticipated required deposits to GSCC's Clearing Fund in a timelymanner, (3) satisfies certain minimum capital requirements, and (4) hasan established, profitable business history of at least six months.Rules 2 and 15 provide the Board with discretion, in applying these standards,to impose greater requirements, to determine that one or more of such standardsas applied to a particular applicant is unduly or disproportionately severe,or to determine that GSCC does not, at the time of consideration of theapplication, have adequate capability to admit the applicant.Rule 15 provides that an existing member must maintain certain ``continuance''standards, including maintaining the relevant standards and qualificationsfor admission to membership and not violating any GSCC rule or procedure.With regard to Rule 1 (Definitions), various definitions have been revisedor added to take into account the revisions to current Rule 2 and the additionof Rule 15.(b) The proposed rules changes will promote the prompt and accurate clearanceand settlement of securities transactions for which GSCC is responsibleand are, therefore, consistent with the requirements of the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunderapplicable to self-regulatory organizations.B.
