Cease-fire agreements signed by the Communists, Malaysia andThailand brought to a close 41 years of conflict that costthousands of lives and at one time involved 70,000 British andCommonwealth troops.   Analysts in Thailand and Malaysia said meager prospects forsuccess, changes sweeping the Communist world and perhaps China'sreluctance to be linked to the insurgency led to the cease-fire.   Under the agreements, 1,200 guerrillas who operate mostly alongthe rugged, 375-mile frontier are to lay down their arms and returnto civilian life.   The Communist Party's general-secretary, Chin Peng, pledgedloyalty to the Malaysian government. ``We shall disband our armedunits and destroy our weapons to show our sincerity to terminatethe armed struggle,'' he said.   A joint communique said the Communists had agreed ``to terminateall armed activities and bring peace to the entire Thai-Malaysianborder and Malaysia.''   The communique said Thailand and Malaysia will ensure fairtreatment for the disbanded Communists, who began their ``war ofliberation'' in 1948 when Britain ruled what was then called Malayaas a colony.   ``The government of Malaysia will in due course allow formermembers of the disbanded armed units ... to freely participate inpolitical activities within (the) framework of the federalconstitution and the laws of Malaysia,'' the statement said.   The Communists in turn pledged to respect the laws of the twocountries and to participate in social and economic development.   Chin Peng said the agreements were ``consistent with the currenthistorical trend where the peoples of the whole world are strivingfor peace and democracy.''   On the eve of the ceremony, police lifted a 41-year-old curfewin many parts of Malaysia because they said there was no longer anythreat from the guerrillas.   The statement said two agreements were reached, one betweenMalaysia and the Communist Party and the other between Thailand'sInternal Security Operations Command and the Communists.   The ceremony took place in Hat Yai, a southern Thai city 30miles from the Malaysian border.   Chin Peng, who was last seen outside the Communist world in1955, signed the agreements along with Thailand's army commander,Gen. Chaovalit Yongchaiyudh, and Wan Sidek, secretary-general ofthe Home Affairs Ministry of Malaysia.   In the late 1940s and 1950s, the Commonwealth mobilized 70,000troops to fight the largely ethnic Chinese insurgents, and theBritish-led force drove them into the jungle along theThai-Malaysian border.   The British effort ended in 1960 after the deaths of more than10,000 on both sides. But fighting on a lesser scale continuedthrough the next decade, culminating with several successfulThai-Malaysian border sweeps and a Thai amnesty that enticed largenumbers of guerrillas to surrender.   Despite the peace agreement, Malaysia has no plans to do awaywith internal security measures that allow for indefinite detentionwithout trial.   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told reporters Friday that thelaw had helped maintain peace in a multiracial country.   Critics of Mahathir say the law is used to arrest activists whooppose government policies. About 65 people are being held underthe law.   Of Malaysia's 17 million people, 55 percent are Malays, 37percent are Chinese and almost all the rest are Indians.</TEXT></DOC>
