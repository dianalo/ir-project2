Bessemer Securities, a closely held New York investment company, said it agreed to assume Stant's indebtedness, including a $6.6 million industrial revenue bond. A Bessemer spokesman said Stant's management will participate in the leveraged buyout of the unit, but he declined to discuss terms.    In a leveraged buy-out, a company is purchased largely with debt. The borrowings then are repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    Stant, which produces automotive radiator and gas caps, was a subsidiary of Purolator Corp., which merged with Emery last month. Emery, an air freight carrier, said the transaction is part of a plan to generate cash and reduce debt through asset sales. </TEXT></DOC>
