<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-06-1038 </DOCNO><TEXT>The leading parameters involved are examined: nature of the greenhouseeffect, carbon cycle, CO/sub 2/ transfer on a worldwide scale, tracegases, climatic consequences of the greenhouse effect due to CO/sub 2/and trace gases. We reached the following conclusions: (a) The CO/sub2/ and trace-gas concentration in the atmosphere increases exponentiallyin the absence of any regulations. (b) No increase has as yet been detectedin the Earth's average temperature due to the greenhouse effect. (c)Human activity also produces antagonistic cooling effects that are ratherpoorly understood. (d) The study of ancient climates indicates a regularsuccession of cool and warm periods. (e) However, it is absolutely necessaryto improve our fundamental understanding of factors governing the Earth'sclimate, and eventually to limit the production of some trace gases (Freon,in particular). 41 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
