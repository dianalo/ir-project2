(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An AIDs-afflicted husband and wife tolda judge Thursday that they and others suffering from the diseaseneed to smoke marijuana to overcome symptoms and side effects ofother drugs.   Kenneth and Barbara Jenks, who are charged with possessing andcultivating marijuana, argued as the trial opened in state courtthat they were innocent because they used the drug for medicalreasons.   ``I've got to smoke marijuana. I've got to or I'm going todie,'' Mrs. Jenks, 24, testified during the non-jury trial in thisPanhandle city. ``I'm going to die anyway, but I would like to havemy life a little better.''   The couple from Panama City Beach are using the defense ofmedical necessity. It has been the basis of three other courtrulings around the nation that permitted people to use marijuana.   Those cases and two permits issued by the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration have been for people who smoke marijuana to relievesuffering from glaucoma, an eye disease, and multiple sclerosis,expert witnesses said.   The Jenkses would be the first to get court approval inconnection with acquired immune deficiency syndrome if CircuitJudge Clinton Foster rules in their favor.   Assistant State Attorney Quinton Broxton argued the coupleshould be found guilty because they had failed to try a legalalternative, that of seeking to obtain a federal permit for medicaluse of marijuana.   The couple said they have since applied for such a permit.   Jenks, 28, said he was a hemophiliac and received AIDS through ablood transfusion, then gave the disease to his wife, who also hasuterine cancer. The two were diagnosed with the disease in 1988.   The couple said the marijuana alleviated loss of appetite,vomiting and nausea caused by AIDS and by drugs they have beentaking for the disease, including AZT.   ``When I started taking AZT, I lost all reason to eat,'' Jenkssaid. ``I just couldn't eat.''   About an hour after smoking marijuana, he said, ``I ateeverything in the house.''   Jenks said his wife was throwing up other medications until theybegan using marijuana.   ``She would lay on the couch with a bucket beside her,'' he said.   Mrs. Jenks said after she began using marijuana she gained backabout half the 40 pounds she had lost, and stayed out of thehospital for a year. After their arrest March 29 she said she lost17 pounds down to 115 pounds and had to be hospitalized.   The couple said they grew their own marijuana because it wasdifficult to obtain the illicit drug and when it was available theycouldn't afford it.   Daniel Danzak, a University of Alabama professor who has doneresearch on marijuana as a medicine, testified on behalf of thecouple, as did Bob Randall, president of the Washington, D.C-basedAlliance for Cannabis Theraputics.   Danzak said 34 studies have shown marijuana can controlpotentially deadly vomiting, possibly by suppressing the functionsof a part of the brain that induces nausea.   ``I've never heard of anyone overdosing on marijuana,'' Danzaksaid.   Randall won one of the prior court rulings on medical use of thedrug, enabling him to smoke marijuana legally to treat hisglaucoma. Randall's organization is pushing for changes in federalregulations to allow medical marijuana use.   He told the judge he didn't think Mrs. Jenks would still bealive if she hadn't used marijuana.   ``Without marijuana they didn't eat anything at all,'' Randallsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
