Protest leaders, however, denounced themeeting as a government plot to destroy their campaign.   They said 41 universities in Beijing would continue theirweek-old class boycott until the government accepts their newlyformed student union as the true representative of students. Thegovernment has declared the group illegal.   Despite the complaints, the meeting was an unprecedented eventin a country where the people and their leaders have little contact.   Radio and television stations carried a lengthy broadcast of themeeting, providing some of China's most eloquent citizens with arare platform to criticize the government.   ``Does Premier Li Peng really fear the people?'' asked one ofthe 45 students present. ``If not, why won't he talk with us?``   ``Most people I know don't believe the Chinese press. It shouldbe allowed to tell the truth and not used by the party,'' saidanother.   The 3{-hour meeting, with State Council spokesman Yuan Mu, StateEducation Minister He Dongchang and high-ranking officials from theBeijing city goverment, marked the first time government officialshave met with student activists since protests began two weeks ago.   Government officials, speaking on behalf of Premier Li, calledon the students to return to class. They made no promises to changestate policy but acknowledged student complaints and implied thatfurther meetings would be possible.   The appearance of Yuan, believed to be part of the inner circleof the nation's top decision-makers, was an indication of howseriously the government regards the recent unrest.   The meeting was part of a series of concessions and defeats thegovernment has suffered since the protests began.   On April 22, for example, the government was unable to put intoeffect an order closing Tiananmen Square because 150,000 studentsand their supporters occupied it to commemorate the death of oustedCommunist Party leader Hu Yaobang. It was his death April 15 thatsparked the first demonstrations for political reforms and freepress.   On Thursday, tens of thousands of students marched through linesof police, defying threats of a government crackdown, in thebiggest demonstration in Communist China's 40-year history.   Both Yuan and He cracked jokes and laughed throughout themeeting as they sought to adopt a conciliatory attitude toward thestudent movement.   At one point, Yuan said the government ``understood thepatriotic fervor, the desire to push democracy and deepen thereforms expressed by the students in their marches.''   The statement indicated a radical change from the shrill tone ofan editorial last week in the People's Daily, accusing the studentsof plotting to overthrow the socialist system. An editorial in theSaturday editions of the People's Daily also expressed sympathy forthe students' goals.   The government apparently hopes it can split most of Beijing'sstudents from the leaders of the independent student associationthat has organized the protest. The government has said the group,the United Association of Beijing Universities, is illegal.   If the government succeeds in its goal, it is unclear whatawaits the association's leaders. Several fear arrest.   Most participants at Saturday's meeting came from the officiallyappointed unions. Only two came from the independent association'sleadership, although other participants said they were sympatheticto the association's goals.   Wu'er Kaixi, the president of the association, was invited tothe meeting but not allowed to attend after he refused to give up aplan to openly denounce the government's position that theassociation was illegal.   ``We will by no means acknowledge that this meeting was adialogue,'' Wu'er said at a hastily called news conference. ``Thisis a plot to co-opt our movement. Our minimum condition is thatthey accept us as a legal organization.''   At Beijing University, several hundred students crowded around aloudspeaker, hooting derisively at the broadcast.   ``Shut up!'' they yelled as Yuan explained that the government``had achieved grand success in fighting corruption.''   Many students believe that corruption has so infected thegovernment that it is beyond saving.   Other barnyard noises followed when he claimed that Hu had leftthe party of his own accord in 1987.   Hu was purged after he was accused of not cracking down hardenough on pro-democracy demonstrations in 1986-87.   Students at Beijing University published the first edition of astudent-run paper, the News Journal, a four-page mimeographedpamphlet with articles supporting the strike and the studentmovement.   The Chinese government, meanwhile, criticized a U.S. statementon the recent demonstrations, calling it inappropriate because thedemonstration ``is purely China's internal affair.''   In Washington, the State Department said that all people shouldhave the right of peaceful assembly, ``including peaceful protestand freedom of expression.''   Student leaders have said the class boycott will go on untilThursday, the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, China'sfirst student demonstrations for democracy.</TEXT></DOC>
