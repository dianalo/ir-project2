Soonthe stream began to overflow its banks, sending De Soto and his fellowexplorers scurrying for higher ground to make camp. On April 20, the riverreached its height and began to recede. By the end of May, it was back in itsnormal channel. De Soto and the boys didn't realize it, but this was the firsttime the Mississippi River ever flooded in the sight of someone who couldwrite home about it.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  OUR OWN ALMANAC  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  People.  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Compiled from Mercury News wire services.  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910318  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  107  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday March 18, 199100078019,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
