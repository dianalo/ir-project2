YangStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/03/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The recent stock-market collapse dealt a serious blow to commercial bankers' hopes of persuading Congress to allow them into the lucrative field of securities underwriting.    Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire had planned to introduce legislation to do just that, but decided to put it off because of the crash. Although the Wisconsin Democrat says he still intends to go ahead with the bill, its future, acknowledges a top aide, &quot;is an open question.&quot;    Lawmakers are likely to have little enthusiasm for tampering with the Depression-era legal barrier between commercial and investment banking, known as the Glass-Steagall Act, that was born of the 1929 market crash. &quot;I wouldn't rush out right now with a bill,&quot; says Utah Sen. Jake Garn, the ranking Republican on the banking committee and a proponent of change. &quot;It may be well-intentioned, but more harmful than good.&quot;    For the banking industry, it seems, something always comes along to spoil things. The last time Congress came close to giving banks securities powers, in 1984, Continental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co. of Chicago faltered, necessitating a record $4.5 billion rescue package from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.    Bad timing, though, is only one of the banks' problems. Despite their image as wielders of vast political power, banks haven't been able to sway Congress on major issues. The reason, say lawmakers and lobbyists, is that the industry is so diverse and divided that it can't effectively lobby lawmakers with a compelling argument. &quot;It's awfully frustrating to see them come up with six different messages,&quot; says a Treasury official.    Earlier this year, for example, Sen. Proxmire introduced legislation that would have given banking companies limited securities-underwriting powers. But the industry couldn't muster any support, and within a week, Mr. Proxmire retreated when only one other Democrat on the banking committee supported him. Instead, Congress passed a one-year moratorium on new powers for banks, a setback for bankers and a victory for the securities industry.    That stands in sharp contrast to the legislative victories won this year by the bankers' brethren in the savings and loan industry, who successfully fought against the Reagan administration to limit the amount of new funds the industry would have to raise for the federal thrift deposit insurance fund. Thrift executives nationwide telephoned their representatives before an important House vote; one even traveled to Washington from California and pulled his congressman off the House floor to press his case.    That sort of grass-roots lobbying had been missing from the bankers' efforts until recently, largely because the industry itself isn't unified. A half-dozen different trade groups in Washington represent the varied interests of the nation's 15,000 banks. While they can agree on some issues -- they joined together last week to defeat an attempt in the House to cap credit-card interest rates -- big banks and small banks remain far apart on many others.    The large money-center and regional banks, for instance, are leading the drive to get into the securities business. But smaller community banks are generally too little to be able to take advantage of those new powers and fear that the big banks entering the securities field would get so big they would dominate the nation's banking system.    Last Thursday, the leaders of the Independent Bankers Association of America, which represents small institutions, voted to oppose Sen. Proxmire's proposal. &quot;There really isn't that much interest among my group in securities powers,&quot; explains Kenneth Guenther, the organization's executive vice president. &quot;We're very different animals.&quot;    Trying to keep all of the industry's divergent institutions together is the American Bankers Association. The group is an organization divided. It relies on its big, money-center members for financial support and on its smaller members spread across the country for broad political clout.    Lawmakers and their aides tell of being lobbied by the American Bankers Association for new bank powers and then being told by bankers back home that they really didn't care about the issue. &quot;It gives the members (of Congress) the out to do nothing,&quot; says an aide to a House Banking Committee member. &quot;When the banking industry has major differences, our effectiveness is diluted,&quot; says Edward Yingling, the group's chief Washington lobbyist.    The securities, insurance and real estate industries, though, have been unified in urging Congress to keep banks out of their fields. Congressional aides still talk about the insurance industry's show of force in 1982. Insurance agents from across the country swarmed over Capitol Hill the morning the House Banking Committee considered whether to let banks into their business, taking panel members to breakfast and then accompanying them to the committee meeting to watch the lawmakers vote in favor of the insurance industry.    In addition, the bankers haven't been able to frame their arguments in a politically attractive fashion. On the question of securities powers, for instance, the banks argue that they need to increase their profitability, making the issue a turf battle over who is going to make the money in securities underwriting. They haven't been able to present their argument in terms of benefiting anyone other than themselves.    &quot;They have used the wrong approach,&quot; says Steven Roberts, a principal for Peat Marwick who was an assistant to former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker. &quot;Congress isn't going to take sides in a profitability issue, but they would if they could see that customers would save money.&quot;    All of the major banking trade groups are currently united to urge lawmakers not to extend the moratorium on new powers for banks when it expires March 1. About 400 leading members of the American Bankers Association visited their representatives and senators in September and a letter-writing campaign at the group's convention in Dallas generated 2,100 messages for Capitol Hill.    But officials of other banking trade groups doubted that this new-found unity would extend to the next step, pressing for new powers once the moratorium is over. The decision of the small banks' organization to oppose the Proxmire proposal didn't surprise the big banks' representatives, who weren't counting on the support of the small institutions. Says one trade group official: &quot;I was never very sure that they're going to stay the long haul on this one.&quot;    ---                 Major Banking Trade Groups    American Bankers Association          12,000 banks    Independent Bankers Association of    6,600 small,      America                             community banks    Consumers Bankers Association         725 banks and                                          thrifts with retail                                          operations    Bank Capital Markets Association      175 banks dealing                                          in government                                          securities    Association of Reserve City Bankers   150 money-center                                          and regional bank                                          holding companies   Source: The Trade Groups</TEXT></DOC>
