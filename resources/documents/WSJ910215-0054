The two states are the first to getcounts of population by race and ethnic group from the 1990census.   The results show that the numbers of Asians or PacificIslanders grew 137% in Vermont and 140% in Virginia duringthe 1980s. Despite their rapid growth in numbers during the1980s, Asians are still a small share of most states'populations. Asians now make up 2.6% of Virginia's 1990population of 6,187,358 and 0.6% of Vermont's 562,758, upfrom 1.2% and 0.3%, respectively, in 1980. Census Bureausurveys show that close to 3% of the total U.S. population isAsian.   The number of Hispanics in Virginia doubled between 1980and 1990, while the number in Vermont grew only 11%.Hispanics are still a small group in both states, accountingfor less than 1% of Vermont's 1990 population and 2.6% ofVirginia's. Nationwide, about 8% of the population isHispanic. (Note: Most Hispanics are included in figures forthe white population.)   The number of blacks grew 72% in Vermont during the 1980s,compared with 15% growth in Virginia. Even so, they are stilla much smaller minority in Vermont. Less than 1% of Vermont's1990 population was black, compared with 19% of Virginia's.Blacks make up 12% of the U.S. population.   Since 99% of Vermont's population was white in both 1980and 1990, the growth rate for whites in the 1980s was thesame as for the state, 10%. Virginia's white population grew13%, slightly below the state's total growth rate of 16% forthe decade. Virginia's population is 77% white, down from 79%in 1980.                                                                                                          What People Do   Vs. What They Say                                                                                                          SOMETIMES PEOPLE don't do what they say. A recent CensusBureau study sheds light on the differences between those whosay they vote and those who actually do. It also points upsome problems in how these differences are measured.   According to the Clerk of the U.S. House ofRepresentatives, 91.6 million votes were cast in November1988, representing 50% of the estimated voting-agepopulation. That's the lowest presidential-election votingrate found in Census Bureau records dating back to the 1930s.   But electoral records don't have data about the kinds ofpeople who vote and don't vote. Concern about low voterturnout among blacks in the early 1960s prompted the CensusBureau in 1964 to begin asking Americans about theirregistration status and voting behavior. These biennialsurveys provide data about the age, sex, race and othercharacteristics of voters and nonvoters.   The surveys also turn up some interesting discrepancies inthe number of votes counted by the Clerk of the House and thenumber of people who tell the Census Bureau that they voted.Based on the bureau's 1988 survey sample, an estimated 102.2million people said they had voted, 12% higher than theofficial vote count.   Some of the difference could be caused by the fact thatsurveys don't always accurately reflect the population. Butit's also likely that many respondents say they vote whenthey don't. Whatever the reasons, the biggest discrepanciesbetween official vote counts and self-reported voters arefound in the South, and in states with large blackpopulations and low per-capita personal income.                                                                                                          Many Find Their Jobs   In the Right Field                                                                                                          THIS SHOULD be good news to parents putting kids throughcollege and wondering if it's worth it: Most recent collegegraduates have jobs related to their field of study.   The National Center for Education Statistics surveyedpeople who received bachelor's degrees in 1986. The Bureau ofLabor Statistics analyzed the survey and found that 50% ofthe 1986 graduates who were working a year later had jobsclosely related to their college majors. This share ranged byfield from 13% of history majors to 92% in nursing.   Seventy-five percent of education graduates (excludingphysical education) were in closely related jobs, as were 72%of accounting and computer and information-sciences majors.Oddly, only 57% of employed engineering graduates were inclosely related jobs; 31% said that their jobs were somewhatrelated to their field of study.   Those with bachelor's degrees in business and management(except accounting), economics, English, history, politicalscience and sociology were more likely to say that their jobswere somewhat related than closely related to their major.Overall, 77% of graduates had jobs closely or somewhatrelated to their major a year after getting their degrees.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          AMERICANS may save more this year, if they follow throughon their intentions. A telephone survey conducted by MaritzMarketing Research found that 43% of respondents expect tosave more money in 1991 than in 1990. Forty-five percent planto reduce their overall debt . . . Twenty-six percent ofwomen aged 15 to 44 who are or have been married lived withtheir first husband before marriage, according to theNational Center for Health Statistics' 1988 National Surveyof Family Growth. An additional 14% had lived with a manother than their first husband . . . People who lived alonespent an average of $2,257 on food in 1989, according to aBureau of Labor Statistics survey.
