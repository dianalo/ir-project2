Adopted 312-105 Friday, the massive Pentagon budget was the last of 13 annual appropriations bills pushed through the House in little more than a month, totaling more than $639 billion for the year beginning Oct. 1. From the space station to the superconducting supercollider, the bills make modest down payments on expensive new projects, and resources will be further strained by new demands for housing, air transportation and the environment.    Conferences with the Senate over differing versions of the bills are due in September. But the emerging picture shows a new wave of costs facing Congress into the next budget cycle. An estimated $1 billion added in fiscal 1990 to renew low-income housing subsidies is only a fraction of what will be needed in fiscal 1991, and annual payments for the space station and the supercollider will ultimately double and triple.    A 25% increase is slated for facilities and equipment to modernize the nation's air traffic control system, and there is increased pressure for construction of airports. Among social programs, little room is left in fiscal 1990 for any child care initiative; and an increase of 20%, or $1 billion, in aid for low-income public school children will begin being spent in fiscal 1991.    Environmental priorities -- and costs -- are the most striking. Even the foreign aid bill includes a modest initiative on the issue of global warming, and fiscal 1990 appropriations related to defense nuclear wastes will exceed the entire $1.4 billion Superfund for toxic-waste cleanups.    Without agreement on new taxes, the Internal Revenue Service budget is pumped up in the name of enforcement, and even the drug war is looked to for dividends. An estimated $275 million is expected to be realized in fiscal 1989 from seized assets -- enough to cover the salaries of Drug Enforcement Administration agents on board.    The largest of the 13 annual bills, the Pentagon budget reflects a retrenchment of its own. Total spending is more than $4 billion above the current fiscal year, but in allocating these funds, the House adopted a plan that emphasizes buying up weapons already in production and slowing investments in new and often more costly systems.    More than $1.1 billion for the Air Force's advanced tactical fighter is cut entirely, and total Pentagon research and testing accounts are reduced by $2.1 billion from current levels and $4 billion from the Bush administration's request. These cuts overlap with proposed terminations in classified programs including the advanced cruise missile and the &quot;Tacit Rainbow&quot; program to develop an unmanned dronelike craft to confuse enemy defenses.    The annual cost of the advanced cruise missile is kept secret, but it appears to be a major part of an estimated $2 billion cut in classified programs. Tables attached to the bill show a $328.9 million termination in classified Air Force missile programs and $348.6 million in savings from tactical research and development. Among other classified accounts listed, the third largest cut appears to be one of $195.6 million, a one-third reduction, in a set of unidentified Army tactical programs.    The House bill incorporates previous House cuts this year from such high-profile weapons as the B-2 bomber and Midgetman missile. But legislators used their authority to boost spending on conventional weapons. Purchases of F-14 fighters and the Navy's SSN-688 submarine are increased; and in contrast with its frugality elsewhere, the bill doubles the administration's $240.7 million request for developing the Army's light scout, or LHX, helicopter and appears to leave unscathed the Navy's new advanced tactical aircraft.    U.S. troop levels would be reduced more than 16,400 under the bill. Though still largely symbolic, the cut reverses past policy and is part of an effort to move resources to readiness and operations accounts. An estimated $350 million is added to ammunition purchases, and total operations and maintenance spending would grow at more than three times the rate of the overall Pentagon budget.    When Congress returns after Labor Day, attention will shift to the Senate, which has yet to act on nine of the annual bills, including the defense measure. Before leaving Friday, senators quickly approved an estimated $18.4 billion Treasury measure, including funding for the Postal Service and the executive office of the president.    Vice President Dan Quayle stands to benefit from a $200,000 appropriation to make improvements in his official residence and thereby free some privately raised funds to be used for decorating and perhaps a swimming pool.    Amid its attacks on federal largess, the Office of Management and Budget didn't forget to add some funds for itself, as White House Budget Director Richard Darman amended his own office request to add $1 million. Most of it was to help cover pay increases, something that other departments must absorb with existing funds. </TEXT></DOC>
