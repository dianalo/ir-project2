The cut in the prime was led by Morgan Guaranty Trust, aunit of J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., following the Federal ReserveBoard's decision to cut the benchmark discount rate to 4.5%.Although the moves were welcomed by the Bush administration,lenders and borrowers say they are wary of expanding debtuntil there are signs that the economy has turned the corner.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I expect that commercial lending won't grow rapidly inthe early stages of the recovery,&quot; said Richard Peterson,chief economist at Chicago-based Continental Bank.   &quot;While lower rates are helpful, I'm not sure if the costof money, by itself, will change the demand for money,&quot; JamesB. Lee Jr., managing director in charge of structured financeat Chemical Banking Corp.   Yesterday's cut in the prime, the fifth reduction thisyear, brings the benchmark rate to its lowest level since1986. The reduction in the prime should lower the interestrates consumers and small and midsized business pay on bankborrowings, which should provide some stimulus to theeconomy.   But companies do not want to rebuild inventories throughborrowings until there are signs of sufficient demand fortheir products. &quot;Demand for loans won't pick up until we seeseveral consecutive months of employment growth,&quot; said JohnLonski, chief economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc.&quot;It's like what is going to come first, the chicken or theegg.&quot;   The latest data on commercial lending activity show noperceptible increase in activity despite year of declininginterest rates. And even with a lower prime rate, thedifferential between banks' cost of funds and their lendingrates remain stubbornly high as banks restore saggingprofitability through fatter interest margins.   The move by Morgan Guaranty Trust, which is often theleader in cutting the prime, was followed by ManufacturersHanover Corp., BankAmerica Corp., and more than two dozenother banks.   A lower prime rate directly lowers the cost of funds forsmall and midsized businesses that borrow at that rate andconsumers whose home equity loans are pegged to the prime.That should increase the amount of cash individuals have tospend, especially with the holiday season approaching, whilegiving some businesses improved cash flow.   &quot;It's going to provide more support to the economy frombusinesses and households that hold variable-rate debt tiedto prime rather than stimulus from inducing additionaldebt-financed spending,&quot; said Mr. Lonski.   Larger businesses that borrow at a spread over the Londoninterbank offered rate will benefit as well because a lowerfederal funds rate, which accompanied the discount rate,tends to bring down the London interbank rate as well. TheFederal Reserve cut the federal funds rate to 4.75%yesterday.   To be sure, some bankers say commercial lending has pickedup in the past few months. Blue-chip corporations such asPhilip Morris Cos. and Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. have arranged newmultibillion bank credit lines that have increased theiroverall borrowing power.   Sears Roebuck, for instance, recently raised a new $4.2billion credit line through Morgan Guaranty Trust, replacinga $3 billion bank line. And John Hancock Mutual LifeInsurance Co. is seeking to raise a $1 billion credit linethrough Morgan Guaranty to replace a $500 million creditfacility, bankers say.   &quot;There's definitely been a pickup in activity,&quot; saidLoretta Hennessey, vice president in charge of syndicationsat Bank of Montreal. &quot;Many banks are open for business andwant to lend and book new deals.&quot;   But the bulk of the new credit lines are refinancingexisting bank lines rather than boosting overall borrowing.The commercial loan consulting firm Loan Pricing Corp.forecasts that $68 billion in large syndicated loans come duein the next two years, but predicts that &quot;net demand forfresh lending will remain relatively modest next year.&quot;   Moreover, the blue-chip companies typically use the linesto back up commercial paper programs rather than making useof the credit line immediately. And many large corporationssuch as FMC Corp. have been locking in fixed-rate debtthrough the placement of securities.   &quot;It will be a minor positive for us because most of ourdebt is fixed,&quot; said Arthur Lyons, chief financing officer.   Some bankers say the gloomy economic data of late havemade banks more cautious. Mr. Lee of Chemical, which has beeninvolved in many of this year's large transactions, believesthat &quot;a new chill has set in&quot; among banks that participate inunderwriting and placement of major financing.   &quot;Recent macroeconomic indicators have caused a slightretreat in the structuring and placement of big-ticketdeals,&quot; he said.   Some consumer finance experts caution that personalborrowing costs probably will remain high despite thereduction in interest rates. Banks are slow in shrinkingtheir margins because of increased consumer delinquency ratesand lower outstanding credit card balances.   &quot;The notion that a reduction in the prime rate leads tolower consumer borrowing costs is a myth,&quot; said Robert Heady,president of Bank Rate Monitor, a North Palm Beach, Fla.,newsletter.   And it's not just consumers that are paying higher ratesover a benchmark rate such as prime or Libor. Top-qualityborrowers such as Philip Morris and Sears are paying a higherinterest spead over Libor for bank credit lines in thecurrent climate. Banks are seeking to keep the size of loanssmall and often want to shorten the terms of loans, expertssay.   &quot;It continues to be true that banks remain interested inshorter maturities, higher pricing and smaller commitments,&quot;said Mr. Lee.   Despite the cut, banks have kept the margin between theirborrowing costs and lending rates historically wide tobolster profitability. The spread between the federal fundsrate and the prime rate now stands at about 2.75%. From 1984through 1990, though, the average spread was 1.72%, accordingto Moody's. The last time three-month Treasury bills were atthe current rates was 1971, when the prime rate was 5.7%.   &quot;The spread is well above the long-term average,&quot; said Mr.Lonski. &quot;Banks are demanding a larger risk premium than inthe past. Caution is still the watchword.&quot;   ---   Peter Pae contributed to this article.
