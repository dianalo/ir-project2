(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A numbing Christmas freeze causedwidespread damage to Florida crops, but citrus growers wereoptimistic Tuesday that trees suffered little damage and much ofthe iced fruit can be turned into juice.   Florida's third major killer freeze in six years was notbelieved as disastrous to citrus as those in December 1983 andJanuary 1985.   But near-total losses were reported in winter vegetables _ muchof it destined for Northeastern markets _ in large areas of thestate.   Agriculture officials said it was too early to estimate thefinancial losses. In some cases, the full extent of damage will notbe known for weeks or months.   Elsewhere, Texas officials estimate 70 percent of that state'scitrus crop and 80 percent of the winter vegetable crop weredestroyed by the cold weather.   Sleet, snow, rain and wind combined with temperatures rangingfrom the teens to the high 20s throughout the Florida peninsuladuring the weekend. The cold contributed to at least seven deathsand caused burst water pipes and other problems for residents usedto sub-tropical December weather.   The multibillion-dollar citrus industry was still recoveringfrom the earlier freezes that wiped out some 250,000 acres of trees.   But many growers believed the major damage this time wasconfined to the fruit.   ``I don't think it was a tree-killing freeze,'' said Dan Gunter,executive director of the Florida Department of Citrus.   More than 80 percent of the citrus crop was still on the treeswhen the cold arrived, and few groves escaped damage in the700,000-acre citrus belt.   Vegetables, strawberries, ornamental plants and other crops werealso hard hit.   Florida Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner said there wereheavy losses of beans, squash, corn, tomatoes and watermelons. Hesaid he hoped enough citrus and vegetables could be salvaged tomaintain market supplies.   ``With shortages, naturally prices will go up. I just hope thatwe have enough fruit to keep a rather stable market becauseeveryone prefers to have product in the marketplace rather thanheavy limitations on supply and unreasonable prices,'' thecommissioner said.   Central Florida growers said thousands of acres of carrots,radishes, cauliflower and broccoli were destroyed and little wouldbe salvageable.   The $1 billion foliage industry, one of the state'sfastest-growing agriculture commodities, suffered a minimum of 20percent losses statewide, said Earl Wells, executive vice presidentof the Florida Nurserymen and Growers Association.   Almost 90 percent of the Florida orange crop goes into juice.Gunter said the citrus industry had large stocks of juiceconcentrate. That stock and the larger-than-normal Brazilian citruscrop should stabilize juice prices somewhat, he said.   ``Because of that, there might be a more moderate impact than wemight expect for a freeze year,'' Gunter said.   Nevertheless, commodities traders sharply bid up the price oforange juice futures Tuesday, speculating that the freeze wouldcause a scramble for supplies. The January contract for frozenconcentrated orange juice rose 16.1 cents to $1.531 a pound on theNew York Cotton Exchange.   Harvesting crews were out in force in bright, sunny weatherTuesday. Citrus growers rushed to pick early and midseason orangesand grapefruit and get them to processing plants to be turned intojuice before spoilage.   Ironically, growers now hope the cool weather will stick aroundfor a week or so during the citrus harvesting and round-the-clockprocessing. Temperatures forecast in the 60s and 70s later in theweek would hasten juice loss in the damaged fruit.   Rapidly rising temperatures in Texas blocked efforts to salvagefrozen fruit for juice. Growers said they were dealt the fatal blowMonday when temperatures shot into the mid-50s, reducing the frozenfruit to mush.   ``It appears to me even the canneries wouldn't accept it becausethe fruit has been frozen so bad,'' said Joe Kutzenberger,president of KY Farms in Harlingen, Texas. ``It's turning soft andeven bleeding through the skin of the fruit. I would say it's atotal loss.''   Losses to Texas citrus industry are estimated at $200 million sofar and could top $500 million as trees begin to show effects fromthe freeze, said David Galvan of the Texas Department ofAgriculture.   The Florida Citrus Commission said Tuesday it would not invokeemergency rules limiting shipments of fresh fruit that sufferedicing. Commission Chairman Bill Becker said the industry wasrelying on the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Inspection Service,affiliated with U.S. Department of Agriculture, to ensure thequality of fresh-fruit shipments.</TEXT></DOC>
