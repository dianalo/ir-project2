Texas plumbers called for out-of-state reinforcements, hotelswith water offered special rates to folks desperate to bathe, andthe National Guard trucked water in to Pollock, La.   ``It's unbelievable, unbelievable,'' said Bennie Payne, who wasbusy dispatching plumbers from his Central Plumb It Yourself Supplyin Baton Rouge, La. ``Our guys are working till they drop. I don'tknow how much longer they can keep up this pace.''   However, in one of the hardest hit cities, Jackson, Miss.,officials said today that they were making rapid progress towardfixing the broken pipes and restoring normal service.   From Dallas to Raleigh, N.C., a strange sort of spring thawfollowed the rare weekend freeze: Pipes, unprotected from the cold,cracked open as freezing water expanded, then began dripping andgushing as temperatures rose Monday and Tuesday.   The worst of the South's cold wave appeared over, with theNational Weather Service predicting lows today at or above freezingin much of the region and rising to the 50s and 60s today andThursday.   Elsewhere, freezing rain was forecast today across the Plainsand light snow from the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley east into WestVirginia, western Pennsylvania and New York state and into NewEngland.   The wintry weather has been blamed for the deaths of 97 peoplesince Dec. 15.   The cold destroyed much of Florida's valuable citrus crop andfroze an estimated 65 percent of Texas' oranges and grapefruit onthe trees.   Louisiana fishermen were astounded to see ice in the shallowswhere they earn their living.   ``We have banks that are solid white with fish and frozen fishfloating everywhere,'' said Joe Buras, president of the DeltaCommercial Fishermen's Association of Plaquemines Parish. ``We haveislands with ice sticking 2 or 3 feet high and bays that are frozensolid.   ``It looks like Alaska it's so bad right now.''   Particularly hard-hit with water problems were Jackson, with anestimated 60,000 homes and businesses left dry, and Houston, whereone official guessed the number affected may have topped 100,000.   Jackson officials asked laundries, car washes and otherbusinesses that use large amounts of water to stay closed a secondday today, and non-essential government workers were ordered tostay home.   Residents who had water were warned to boil it for three minutesto kill germs that are a threat when levels are low. Low pressurealso hampered firefighters' in battling blazes.   However, Mayor Kane Ditto said today that conditions werequickly returning to normal.   ``We are in much better shape this morning,'' Ditto said onABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``We suspect that about 20 percentof the homes might now be out of water and hopefully those will beback up sometime during the day.''   Ditto said 10 crews were restoring service to the remainder of150 major breaks reported since Saturday.   Houston residents hankering for showers were obliged _ at$25-a-douse _ in the downtown Holiday Inn and the Ramada Inn nearthe Astrodome.   Low pressure plagued much of the city and homeowners foundwaiting lists as long as two weeks for plumbers.   The John Moore Plumbing Co., with a backlog of 2,000 troublecalls, was recruiting out-of-state plumbers to bolster its staff of28, said Shirley Kurtz, sales manager.   Plumbing breaks also caused problems in places including Dallas,Baton Rouge, Mobile, Ala., Meridian, Miss., Charleston, S.C., andRaleigh.   In West Ashley, S.C., Linda Singletary said her water pressurewas so low it took 45 minutes to run a sinkful to wash the dishes.   ``The shower, you can't soap yourself down because it wauld takeyou three hours to get the soap off,'' Ms. Singletary said.``Washing your hair is out of the question.''   More serious problems abounded.   Four National Guard trucks from Camp Beauregard, La., hauled6,000-gallon water trailers to the desperately dry town of Pollock.   Water gushing from broken pipes ruined 240,000 pounds of foodintended for distribution to the needy, said Ron Prado, director ofthe Bay Area Food Bank.   Cold-caused property damage in the Dallas area, most of it frombroken pipes, could total $25 million, an insurance industry grouppredicted.   Among Dallas businesses with water damage was The Hard RockCafe, where a pipe broke, pumping 900,000 gallons of water into thebasement Christmas Day.   ``We lost all our food, computers and amplifiers,'' saidassistant general manager Rob Perez. ``It was pretty brutal.''</TEXT></DOC>
