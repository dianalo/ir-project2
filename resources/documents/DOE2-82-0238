Axis potential was obtained from Tomas-Fermipotential with molier screening function by averaging along the axisand by thermal vibrations of chain atoms. Channeling particles radiatedue to motion in the field with nonzero gradient of potential, assigningintensity of electric field of the chain, obtained in numerical formfrom atomic axis potential. Impact parameters p and incidence anglesparticles {theta} with respect to the axis were calculated. Specificradiation losses were obtained by averaging by impact parameters andinlet angles. Correlation with calculation results obtained in kineticapproximation and experimental ones was given.</TEXT></DOC>
