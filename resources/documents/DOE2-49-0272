The temperature inNorthern China is comparatively low, to obtain a high biogas productivity,quick digestion of animal wastes in short period of time and high energyoutput in mesophilic fermentation poses a question. The answer is tocreate favorable conditions and environment for methanelization, i.e.,rational process for biogas fermentation and advanced engineering system.The Gold Star Dairy Farm is located in the southern suburbs of Beijing.The 336 dairy cattle of the farm produce 10 tons of manure dairy, equivalentto 3600 tons of manure annually. A 300 cu m mesophilic digester systemwas established and started operation in the summer of 1984. In the twoyears of operation, the digester treats 6 ton manure and produces 180-200cu m biogas eachday. Apart from heating and cooking for a canteen, thebiogas produced can generate 150 kWh electricity, which is utilized formilking and refrigeration of milk products. In addition, the biogas effluentcan be used as fertilizer for farm land and feed for fish raising.</TEXT></DOC>
