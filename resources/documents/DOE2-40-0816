The investigatorsexposed rats for four hours to either: a mixture of ozone, nitrogen dioxide,sulfur dioxide, manganese, ferric and ammonium sulfates, and carbon soot;a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid; a mixture of ozone and nitrogendioxide; or ozone. The effects examined included: reflex breathing-patternchanges, histopathological changes in the lung and nasal regions, changesin particle-clearance rates, and changes in pulmonary surfactant. Acidcomponents had no significant effects on the parameters examined. Mixturescontaining 0.35-ppm ozone showed effects that could be attributed toozone alone.</TEXT></DOC>
