The International Intellectual Property Alliance said Wednesdayit was urging the Bush administration to maintain pressure onforeign governments to curtail this massive loss of U.S. property.   The alliance said their 1,600 member companies can only do somuch against piracy that often is condoned by foreign governments,and the U.S. government must go to bat.   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association ofAmerica, told reporters his group was spending $40 million year tofight estimated losses of $1 billion annually from piracy and lackof market access.   ``There comes a time when you've done all you can do and youneed the muscular arm of your government,'' Valenti said.   ``The first step has to be government,'' concurred Jay Berman,president of the Recording Industry Association of America, becausein most cases piracy ``goes on with government condonement.''   The alliance said U.S. government intervention had helped cut byhalf the estimated $1.3 billion that was lost to pirates in 10nations in 1984. But problems remain, and while one nation,Singapore, has been dropped from that list, three more were addedin 1988: The People's Republic of China, Saudi Arabia and India.   Piracy losses totaled $418 million in China in 1988; $189million in Saudi Arabia; and $123 million in India, the alliancesaid. Another $30 million was lost in India due to lack of access,the group said.   In the 12 nations piracy still is costing U.S. companies $1.3billion, said Eric Smith, general counsel to the alliance.   Lack of access is costing American manufacturers an additional$95 million, for a total piracy and market access loss of about$1.4 billion annually, he said.   Unless the 12 nations on the new list take meaningful measuresto shape up, they will be candidates for designation as a``priority foreign country'' under the 1988 Omnibus Trade andCompetition Act, Smith said.   That could mean the U.S. Trade Representative could conduct aso-called Section 301 trade investigation against these nations,leading ultimately to trade actions if necessary, Smith said.   The 12 nations are: China, Saudi Arabia, Korea, India, thePhilippines, Taiwan, Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia, Thailand, Nigeriaand Malaysia.   Thanks to U.S. government pressure, piracy in Indonesia droppedfrom $206 million to $45 million in the four-year period, whilepiracy declined in Nigeria from $131 million to $22 million in theperiod, the alliance said.   Berman said that in recordings alone, piracy dropped from $400million in 1984 to just $1 million in 1988 in Singapore andIndonesia.   ``The leverage provided by the 301 process has encouragedcountries to give attention to this problem,'' Smith said.   Nicholas Veliotas, president of the Association of AmericanPublishers, said the International Trade Commission had estimatedthat total losses of intellectual property to the United States,such as patents, copyrights and trade secrets, ranged from $60billion to $100 billion a year.   Ronald Palenski, general counsel of the Computer Software andServices Industry Association, said theft of computer software wasa particular problem in China in the hydroelectric andmanufacturing industries.   Palenski said he didn't know if any of the pirated software hadmilitary applications, but the piracy was done with the knowledgeof the Beijing government.   ``I wouldn't call it government sponsored, but it's condoned,''Palenski said.   Smith said the loss figures were compiled from industry surveys.</TEXT></DOC>
