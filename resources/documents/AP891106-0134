Alberto Rispoli, secretary-general of La Scala, said it was ``amiracle'' the company was able to stage all its performances duringthe Oct. 2-Nov. 4 tour in Moscow and Leningrad.   La Scala officials said they had to pay bribes and offer giftsto ensure the shows could go on.   ``Every day we had to deliver something under the table forbeing allowed to work,'' Rispoli said.   Theater superintendent Carlo Maria Badini said he has asked theItalian government to file a protest with the Soviets.   He emphasized, however, that the incidents would not hamperrelations with the Soviets and that President Mikhail S. Gorbachevwill be welcome to visit La Scala during his Nov. 29-Dec. 1 trip toItaly.   Gorbachev, who is scheduled to travel to Milan to meet businessleaders, had expressed a desire to attend the opera. The regularseason opens Dec. 7, but there have been reports that Gorbachevcould attend a rehearsal of Verdi's ``Vespri Siciliani.''   Gorbachev, an avid opera fan, attended a performance of La Scalacompany at Moscow's Bolshoi theater last month.   Sergio Escobar, Badini's assistant, said the performances wenton ``only through daily payoffs and gifts to corrupt officials.This was the only way for getting what had been provided by theoriginal contract.''   ``We were in the hands of a criminal organization,'' Escobaradded. ``It was a bureaucratic inferno.''   ``Trucks disappeared during unloading or loading operations,''said Rispoli. ``Every day we had to deliver something under thetable for being allowed to work. We even considered the possibilityof giving up and returning home. We succeeded in going on stageevery time. It was a miracle.''   The La Scala officials did not go into details of the allegedpayments.   Badini said the Italian company probably was the victim of anongoing dispute between Gosconcert, the state company that controlsand manages cultural performances in the Soviet Union, and theBolshoi, where La Scala performed most of its works.   ``We were caught in the middle of a chaotic situation becausethe forces opposing changes pursued by Gorbachev still are verypowerful in the world of art as well at the highest politicallevels,'' Badini was quoted as saying by Milan's daily Corrieredella Sera.</TEXT></DOC>
