 402 on Reader Service CardandM;DEC and Sun Microsystems have been doing fierce battle in the workstationmarketplace for some time, each claiming every victory it can but unable todeal a crippling blow to the other.andP;  Perhaps this is because each refuses tobe outdone by its rival in price, performance or features.andM;The latest chapter in this RISC rivalry is DEC's aggressive re-pricing of theDECstation 2100, bringing its base price down from $7,950 to $5,950.andP;  Sun hascountered by increasing the clock speed of its extremely popular Sparcstation1 from 20MHz to 25MHz and renaming it the Sparcstation 1+.andM;The price for the Sparcstation 1+ with a 17-inch monochrome monitor (vs.andP;  the15-inch monitor of the base-model DECstation 2100) is $8,995.andP;  The 2100 holdsa slight performance edge as measured by DR Labs' CPU 2 benchmarksuite--11.35 MicroVAX II units of processing (MVUPs) vs.andP;  11.06 MVUPs for theSparcstation 1+, a statistically insignificant difference (Fig.andP;  1).andM;WEIGHING THE RISCSandM;The Sparcstation 1+ and the DECstation 2100 are ultimately neck and neckbecause the Sparcstation 1+ more than makes up for its slight lack of CPUdazzle by the huge number of available applications--a catalog of more than1,800 scientific and business programs.andM;The 2100 and the Sparcstation 1+ have much in common as far as systemconfiguration goes.andP;  There is also a major difference, however: The 2100'sgraphics subsystem cannot be expanded, whereas Sun market severalsophisticated options.andM;The 2100 can support much as 24MB of RAM; the Sparcstation 1+ can support16MB.andP;  Both come standard with 8MB.andP;  Both use the industry-standard SCSI busfor communication with peripheral such as disks and tapes.andM;The 2100, however, lacks a system bus; all components are connected directlyto each other.andP;  Aside from adding memory, there is no provision for systemexpansion.andP;  The Sparcstation 1+, on the other hand, boasts the S bus, a27MB-per-second internal bus for peripherals such as video cards.andM;Because the S bus is new with the Sparcstation, relatively few options arecurrently available for it, but judging by the video cards Sun has for theVME bus in the Sun-4/110 workstation, 2-D and 3-D video cards cannot be faroff.andM;Sun's advantage in the area of available applications, particularly businessapplications, has been enhanced by the recent transfer of such popularMacintosh applications as CA Cricket Graph (graphing software) and CA CricketPresents (presentation software) to Sun platforms.andM;The Sparcstation 1+ and the DECstation 2100 are fairly close in terms of CPUperformance as measured by DR Labs' CPU 2 benchmark suite.andP;  At 11.35 MVUPs,the DECstation 2100 has a slight edge over the Sparcstation's 11.06 MVUPs.andO;This is interesting, because the clock speed of the 2100 is significantlylower than that of the Sparcstation 1+, implying that its RISC implementation(using the R2000 chip set from Mips Computer Systems and Mips' compilers) ismore efficient.andM;After determining compute power, DR Labs' next step in benchmarking a newworkstation is to use the X11perf benchmark suite to measure the machine's Xwindows performance.andM;However, Sun's implementation of X in its NeWS windowing system delivers someanomalous results for several of the tests in X11perf--notably those withwide lines and those that perform operations on single-pixel-sizedobjects--and we felt it would be better not to report results we could notverify.andP;  Therefore, in this review we report only our results for theDECstation 2100 on X11perf.andP;  These results were not surprising (Fig.andP;  2).andM;DXUPs DO THE TALKINGandM;The DECstation 2100 logged 0.75 DXUPs (DECstation 3100 X units ofperformance) in three of the four categories into which DR Labs has dividedX11perf: general graphics tests, terminal emulation and window management.andO;In the fourth category, X-specific operations, the 2100 returned 0.76 DXUPs.andM;The CPU power of the DECstation 2100 is 0.74 times that of the DECstation3100, as measured by DR Labs' CPU 2 benchmark suite, and the implementationof X is the same and the architectures are identical in both machines, so itmakes sense that the DECstation 2100's X performance should be 0.75 timesthat of the 3100.andM;The low base price of the DECstation 2100 compared with the Sparcstation 1+,and its slightly higher CPU performance as measured by our CPU 2 suite ofbenchmarks, give the 2100 a noticeable price/performance advantage over theSparcstation 1+.andM;The price per MVUP of the DECstation 2100 is $101 when we factor out of thecost of disk and memory; the price per MVUP for the Sparcstation 1+ with thisconfiguration is $542.andM;These prices are figured by subtracting the cost of the memory out of adiskless configuration with a two-user license.andP;  Because DEC's memory(MS01-AA) for the DECstation 2100 is extremely expensive ($4,800 for 8MB),extracting its price from the 2100's overall price causes the 2100 to gaintremendously in price/performance.andM;MEMORY CLOSES THE GAPandM;However, when configured with 8MB of memory and a minimal amount of diskstorage, this gap decreases: $700 per MVUP for the 2100 vs.andP;  $949 for theSparcstation 1+.andP;  The 2100 still beats the Sparcstation 1+ by a significantmargin, though.andM;The DECstation 2100 offers very strong performance at a good price, acombination that makes it an able competitor to the Sparcstation 1+.andM;Sun's advantage is that there are many more Sparcstation applicationsavailable, making it desirable for users who want the range of applicationsassociated with a personal computer but who also want the performance of aworkstation.andM;DR Labs benchmarked the DECstation 2100 with 16MB of main memory, a 332MBRZ55 disk drive and a 16-inch color monitor.andP;  We ran Ultrix version 3.1 andUltrix Worksystem Software version 2.2 with Fortran compiler version 2.10.andO;DR Labs benchmarked Sun's Sparcstation 1+ with 8MB of main memory, a 327MBSCSI disk drive and a 19-inch monochrome monitor.andP;  We ran SunOS 4.0.3 withFortran version 1.3.andM;Because workstations are designed for compute-intensive scientific andengineering applications and are meant to free users from the need to sharedepartmental computer systems, the CPU power of such machines must besubstantial.andM;To determine how well the DECstation 2100 and Sparcstation 1+ satisfy thisdemand for processing power, we ran DR Labs' CPU 2 benchmark suite.andP;  CPU 2measures a system's ability to handle scientific and engineeringapplications.andP;  Results reflect the raw speed of a CPU, the efficiency of asystem's Fortran compiler and, to a lesser extent, the speed of memoryaccess.andP;  The results are not affected by a system's I/O capabilities.andM;Because most of a user's interaction with the DECstation 2100 is done throughDEC-windows, DEC's implementation of MIT's X Window System, we evaluated theperformance of this graphical user interface using version 1.2 of the X11perfbenchmark suite.andM;Because Sun's implementation of X windows does not adhere to MIT's definitionin all cases, causing it to deliver anomalous results on several tests inX11perf, we do not report X benchmark results for the Sparcstation 1+.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
