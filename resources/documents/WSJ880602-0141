OPEC officials late yesterday confirmed reports that the conference will open June 11 in Vienna instead of next Wednesday. A senior OPEC official attributed the postponement to &quot;scheduling problems,&quot; including the Arab summit conference that begins Tuesday in Algeria.    &quot;Several of the delegates will probably be at the summit conference,&quot; the OPEC official said. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, OPEC's leading producer, will head the Arab summit meeting.    But some meetings scheduled to take place prior to the conference of all 13 oil ministers are going ahead as scheduled. Representatives of several OPEC member nations already have arrived in Vienna for a meeting that begins today on the &quot;definition&quot; of production.    How crude-oil production is defined emerged as a major issue at a consultative meeting of the oil ministers a month ago. Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister, asserted that some countries -- he specifically cited Venezuela -- were excluding crude oil from their production quotas by calling it something else. Condensates, an oil-like liquid, aren't included in the crude quotas, for example.    In all, according to the Kuwaiti minister, more than two million barrels a day of crude oil produced by OPEC would be outside the quota system if all 13 countries followed the production-accounting procedures of some members. The current crude production ceiling for 12 members of OPEC -- with Iraq excluded -- totals 15.1 million barrels a day, and a more precise definition of production is needed to prevent quota cheating, according to some oil ministers.    But the production quotas also are likely to be an issue at the June conference, OPEC officials said. Some members already are proposing to increase the quotas for the second half, as planned last December when the first-half allotments were set. But most of the OPEC nations are pushing for production quotas to remain where they are -- or possibly to reduce them.    Closely related is the question, still unanswered, of whether OPEC will offer a counterproposal to several non-OPEC oil exporters who proposed last month that the groups coordinate production cuts to trim the world oil glut. The consultative meeting of the OPEC ministers postponed that issue until the June conference. It isn't clear yet whether the non-OPEC group will be invited back to Vienna for further joint talks.    Additionally, Iraq's position will be a major issue at the June meeting, the oil ministers agree. Iraq refuses to accept a quota unless it is given an allotment equal to the 2.36 million barrels a day of its war foe, Iran. But, as previously reported, Issam Abdul Rahim Al-Chalabi, the Iraqi oil minister, said in an interview last week that he is &quot;prepared to share&quot; in any joint production cuts between OPEC and the non-OPEC group even if Iraq remains outside the quota system. </TEXT></DOC>
