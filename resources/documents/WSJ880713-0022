Previously, customers needed balances of at least $1,000 to qualify.    In calculating a customer's average balance, the bank said it counts all accounts a customer has with the bank in determining whether the $3,000 minimum is reached.    A Citibank spokesman said, &quot;the purpose is to cover increased costs. But the point is also to encourage people to bring more accounts to us. Most customers will have no trouble meeting the new minimum.&quot;    Customers who fail to meet the new minimum balance will be charged $7.50 a month, plus 25 cents for each check or withdrawal. The previous charge was $6 plus 25 cents for each transaction.    In recent months, banks have been instituting charges for automatic-teller transactions and other services to boost revenue. Citibank is the leader of the industry and others may follow its step. </TEXT></DOC>
