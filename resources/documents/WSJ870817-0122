And even though prices at the Helsinki Bourse are up 45% this year, on top of last year's 65% surge, Finnish stocks aren't considered at their peak. Finland's robust economy, strong corporate profits and the introduction next month of mutual funds are expected to boost stocks 10% to 20% more this year. Since July 1 alone, Finnish stock prices have risen 10%.    &quot;Finland, until relatively recently, had been totally overlooked&quot; by foreign investors, says Charles Beckford, an analyst at Savory Milln, a London brokerage firm that specializes in Nordic markets. &quot;Now the whole market is more sophisticated,&quot; Mr. Beckford says, &quot;and its rise has been virtually uninterrupted.&quot;    While sluggish liquidity has hampered the Finnish stock market, which is limited to roughly 50 listed companies and just four hours of trading a day, a variety of legal changes in recent years designed to stimulate trading has lured flocks of domestic investors to the market and encouraged foreigners to edge into the fray.    Turnover jumped fourfold between 1983 and 1986, when stock totaling 15.97 billion markkas ($3.5 billion) changed hands. In the first seven months of this year, turnover already has exceeded 15 billion markkas.    Henrik Andersin, a partner at Evli Securities Ltd., a Helsinki brokerage firm, expects Finnish stock prices to rise 20% more this year, underpinned largely by Finland's strong economy. Spending levels are increasing, Mr. Andersin said, and the government has been quickening the pace of deregulation.    Finland's gross domestic product is expected to exceed 3% this year. Meanwhile, private consumption is expected to grow 3%, and exports 2%. Companies have been working hard to keep up with this growth: In the first five months, industrial production was up 5.1% from a year earlier.    At the same time, say economists at Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's second-largest commercial bank, short-term interest rates -- now at about 9.35% -- are expected to fall because of a strong flow of currency into Finland amid looser foreign exchange regulations.    Corporate profits, which grew 20% annually the past two years, are likely to grow that much this year, says Sakari Tumonainen, chief of research at the bank. Dividends have kept up the pace and should grow about 20% as well, he says.    Another positive factor generally cited by analysts is the introduction of mutual funds in Finland starting Sept. 1.    However, Mr. Tumoainen, who will leave his current position next month to head his bank's mutual fund department, warns that the funds may not be as eager buyers as they have been portrayed. He estimates that their investments in stocks may be just several hundred million markkas in the first year as they enter the market cautiously.    And while Henry Kallio, an analyst at Unitas Oy, the brokerage arm of Union Bank of Finland Ltd. expects stocks to rise 10%, he says the liquidity that has buoyed the market may soon be drained by a series of new stock issues.    &quot;Although it's speculation, we can say for sure that there will be 10 to 15 new issues&quot; this fall, Mr. Kallio says. The prospective issuers are encouraged, he says, not only by rising share prices but by a recently adopted law that allows companies to double to 40% the proportion of their shares that foreigners may hold.    However, Finnish investors who don't wish to invest in fixed-income securities have few options besides stocks. The Helsinki real estate market has soared to skyhigh levels, and there is a cap of 10,000 markkas a year that can be invested in foreign stocks, Mr. Andersin of Evli Securities says.    As for stock picks, banking and forestry issues boast the most promising profit growth and offer the best bets for investors, most analysts say.    Among the banking selections are Union Bank of Finland, which sells at 12 times earnings, and Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, which recently underwent a severe restructuring that is expected to quickly result in bigger profits. Its stock sells at 10 times earnings.    And investing in Pohjola Insurance, Finland's largest insurance company, is &quot;like investing in the whole Finnish market in miniature,&quot; Mr. Andersin says, because of the insurer's stock portfolio valued at five billion markkas.    Among forestry and paper companies, which are benefiting from firm product prices, Mr. Andersin's top pick is Enso Gutzeit. The company's per-share earnings should double this year to five markkas ($1.10), he says. Right now the stock sells at nine times earnings. There also is discussion about selling part of the government's majority stake to the public.    United Paper Mills, which sells at 10 times earnings, is attractively priced and presents another good buying opportunity, Mr. Kallio of Unitas says.    Finland's largest publicly traded company, Nokia, a conglomerate whose products encompass electronics, cables, forestry products, paper and chemicals is attractive to Savory Milln's Mr. Beckford. The stock sells at 13 times earnings, and the company has a solid capital base and strong leadership, he says.    London and Tokyo Stocks   London stocks finished slightly higher. The 100-share index was up 5.3 points at 2295.4, and the Financial Times 30-share index rose 6.7 to 1785.3. Volume rose to 575.9 million shares from 539.5 million shares Thursday.    Stocks were knocked off their best levels after news that the U.S. trade deficit widened in June to $15.71 billion from $14.04 billion in May. The trade figures sparked concerns that the dollar may resume its decline, with possible adverse impact on British exporters or global interest rates, a dealer said.    Tokyo stock prices dropped amid profittaking in domestic-demand related stocks, sparked by reportedly stronger-than-expected Japanese buying at this week's U.S. Treasury auction of 30-year bonds.    The Nikkei stock average fell 81.73 points to 25494.01. It was the Nikkei's first decline in eight sessions. The first section index fell 9.93 to 2105.96. Turnover totaled 950 million shares, down from 1.1 billion shares Thursday. Losers outnumbered gainers 506 to 397, while 119 issues were unchanged.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                     % This                                 Aug 13   Aug 12     Year U.S. ........................... 311.7    309.2    + 36.7 Britain ........................ 685.2    683.7    + 37.7 Canada ......................... 460.4    458.5    + 38.2 Japan ......................... 1258.1   1259.5    + 33.1 France ......................... 417.1    414.9    +  2.2 Germany ........................ 249.9    252.6    -  3.8 Hong Kong ..................... 2514.7   2547.6    + 41.4 Switzerland .................... 208.7    210.7    +  3.9 Australia ...................... 393.9    392.5    + 49.2 World index .................... 480.8    479.4    + 34.7</TEXT></DOC>
