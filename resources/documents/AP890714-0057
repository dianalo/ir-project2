Defense attorneys on Thursday hailed the dismissal as proof oftheir contention that the indicted men were only carrying out Reaganadministration policies.   The Neutrality Act allows prosecution of anyone making war fromU.S. soil against a nation with which the United States is at peace.   U.S. District Judge Norman Roettger of Fort Lauderdale agreedwith the defense that the Reagan administration waged war againstthe Sandinistas in 1984-85 despite congressional votes to cut offfunds for the U.S.-supported Nicaraguan rebels.   ``The facts show that the Contras, funded in part by theexecutive branch, continued their attempt to overthrow theSandinista government,'' Roettger wrote. ``The mere fact thatCongress refused to fund the Contra cause for a brief period of timeis not equivalent to saying that the United States was `at peace'with Nicaragua.''   He pointed to the conflicts in Vietnam and Korea as well as U.S.raids on Libya and the invasion of Grenada under the Reaganadministration as evidence that war can be conducted without aformal declaration.   ``It appears that declarations of war between nations have becomepasse,'' the judge said in his opinion released Thursday.   During the hearings, defense witnesses testified that Lt. Col.Oliver North, then a presidential aide, was providing the Contraswith $32 million at the same time the defendants were traininganti-Sandinista mercenaries.   North was convicted May 4 of lying to Congress, altering anddestroying classified National Security Council documents andaccepting an illegal gratuity _ a security fence _ in theIran-Contra affair. He was sentenced last week to two years'probation and a $150,000 fine.   The defendants in the Neutrality Act case also submitted volumesof the Tower Report on the Iran-Contra affair detailing how profitsfrom the sale of weapons to Iran were diverted to the Contras.   Defense attorney John Mattes, who represents former mercenaryJack Terrell, hailed Roettger's decision as a vindication of hisclient.   ``This is the first time in the 10-year history of the U.S. waragainst Nicaragua that a federal judge has had the courage todeclare what we all knew,'' Mattes said Thursday. ``This hasconsequences far beyond a mere district court in south Florida.''   Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office, saidthe prosecutors could not comment on a pending case.   The judge's ruling completely cleared the four defendants accusedof Neutrality Act violations _ Mario Calero, brother of top Contraleader Adolfo Calero; Thomas Posey, head of the privateAlabama-based mercenary group Civilian Materiel Assistance; formerstock broker and conservative fund-raiser Alex Martinez and wealthyTexas businessman Maco Stewart.   Terrell, a former mercenary who soured on the war and providedmuch of the evidence used in the indictment, is named in two minorweapons counts unaffected by the ruling.   Mattes said Terrell's prosecution was ``vindictiveness'' by thegovernment for his role in blowing the whistle on the Contra supplyoperation.   Former Civilian Materiel Assistance activist Jose Coutin faces apassport violation. A seventh defendant, Joe Adams, was included inthe indictment when it was handed up last summer, but pleaded guiltyto one Neutrality Act count, receiving a $50 fine and one day ofprobation.   The seven men were accused of training mercenaries and launchingoperations against the Sandinistas from U.S. soil between October1984 and March 1985.   The indictment, filed a year ago, said they trained themercenaries, armed them in some cases and led them against theSandinistas inside Nicaragua, including one unsuccessful effort toblow up a bridge.</TEXT></DOC>
