Interior Department managers know that secondary uses of refugesare ``causing direct harm to wildlife,'' General Accounting Officeinvestigators concluded.   But they bow to ``intense'' local pressure for more recreationfacilities, or are forced by law to share ownership of the land withother government agencies or private interests such as those withdrilling rights, the report said.   The GAO, Congress' investigative arm, reported on the refuges atthe request of Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., chairman of the HouseGovernment Operations environment subcommittee and Rep. Gerry E.Studds, D-Mass., chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheriesenvironment subcommittee.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service of the Interior Department,which manages the preserves, acknowledged the problems in testimonyprepared for a joint hearing of the two committees.   David Olsen, an assistant director of the wildlife service, saida review is underway to see whether the management system should bechanged.   The GAO investigators found that:   _On the Des Lacs refuge in North Dakota, power boating andwaterskiing have disturbed migratory bird nesting and the broods ofnewly hatched chicks. Duck and other bird production is 50 percentless than it could be.   _At the Chincoteague refuge in Virginia, off-road vehicles andthousands of visitors on the beaches are threatening the breeding ofpiping plovers, an endangered bird, and reducing other migratorybird populations.   _At the Cabeza Prieta refuge in Arizona, military air exercisesincluding air-to-air missile firings are believed to be harming thedesert bighorn sheep and the endangered Sonoran pronghorn antelope.The military is authorized to conduct the exercises.   _Livestock grazing at the Browns Park refuge in Colorado ishampering efforts to improve goose and duck production, disturbingthe nesting birds and destroying plant growth necessary to provideoptional nesting habitats.   _Drilling for new gas wells and operating existing wells at theD'Arbonne refuge in Louisiana is destroying the habitat ofendangered red cockaded woodpeckers and other wildlife. A federaljudge has permitted the continued drilling.   With federal law requiring that refuge use be compatible withwildlife protection, Olsen said, ``The issue of compatibilitydeterminations will receive a lot of attention'' in the governmentreview.   He said activities such as waterskiing on the Des Lacs refuse``would clearly seem incompatible. However, it is an historic use ofthe area, one which the local public has come to expect, and istherefore extremely hard to curtail or eliminate, as you mightimagine.''   He said the proximity of certain refuges to urban areas ``leadsinevitably to pressure'' for picnic grounds, camping facilities,beaches, boat ramps, baseball fields, target ranges and other formsof recreation.   ``Once any of these forms of non-wildlife oriented public usebecomes established, it often increases and becomes difficult toterminate,'' he said.   The GAO report concluded, after conducting a survey of refuges,that managers ``reported that secondary uses are occurring'' on 92percent of all refuges, and ``include all manner of public, economicand military activities'' such as power boating, mining, militaryair exercises, and use of off-road vehicles.   Managers told the GAO they were ``sometimes willing to accept theadverse effects of some harmful activities as the price of obtainingthe good will of the local public or various economic interests.''</TEXT></DOC>
