The approval would mark a major advance in HomeFed's plan to convert to a bank and leave the savings and loan industry's woes behind.    HomeFed's motive is to escape thrift insurance premiums, which are much higher than those charged by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which regulates banks. HomeFed still needs approvals from the FDIC and from California's banking and Sandamp;L departments. Moreover, the massive thrift-bailout bill, which may pass Congress this week, allows thrifts to convert to banks under certain circumstances, but requires them to pay the higher thrift premiums for five years.    Nonetheless, HomeFed's Home Federal Savings andamp; Loan unit is by far the largest thrift that the Bank Board has allowed to bolt the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Deposit Insurance Corp. Several other big, healthy thrifts want out because of the FSLIC's higher premiums -- which will rise further under the bailout plan -- but the Bank Board has been cool to their attempts, fearing that an exodus of strong Sandamp;Ls will further undermine the thrift system. In June, a federal judge in Los Angeles upheld the Bank Board's denial of a similar application by Great Western Financial Corp.'s Great Western Bank.    Last year, HomeFed paid $23.3 million to the FSLIC in premiums and special assessments; its contributions to the fund would have been higher in the next several years under the bailout proposal.    The Bank Board has approved 13 previous applications by thrifts to switch insurers, but all were tiny compared with HomeFed and Great Western.    It wasn't clear why the Bank Board approved the HomeFed application and rejected Great Western's. In denying Great Western's application, the Bank Board said Great Western hadn't filed an appropriate application by the March 31, 1987, deadline for seeking an exemption from a federal law blocking departures from the FSLIC. The Bank Board couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.    Home Federal applied to California regulators and the FDIC for conversion to a state-chartered bank shortly before the deadline. But the Bank Board later asserted that it had jurisdiction over any departures from FSLIC, and the application has been stalled since. Last month, Home Federal sued the Bank Board over the issue; a Home Federal spokeswoman said Home Federal will drop that lawsuit.    The Bank Board placed conditions on its approval of HomeFed's application. In addition to requiring HomeFed to get approvals from other regulatory bodies, it said the thrift must meet with a community group that complained recently about HomeFed's alleged noncompliance with laws requiring financial institutions to meet local community credit needs.    HomeFed also must preserve an existing $20 million pool of funds that belongs to people who were the owners of the thrift when it converted to a stock institution from a mutual institution. Mutual institutions are owned by their depositors.    Ray Mercado, HomeFed's counsel, said it already has plans to meet with the community group and had promised in its original application to regulators that it would preserve the $20 million pool of funds. He said HomeFed is in &quot;ongoing&quot; discussions with the FDIC and state regulators. </TEXT></DOC>
