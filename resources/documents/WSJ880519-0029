Both companies said the combination will give them a better competitive edge and more resources for research and development in the fast-growing $3 billion to $4 billion annual silicones market. Silicones are used in a variety of applications, ranging from bathtub caulking to car gaskets, carpet fibers and fiberglass insulation.    Danbury, Conn.-based Carbide, a chemical maker, said its silicones business is focused primarily on supplying the industrial market. Fairfield, Conn.-based GE produces finished applications of silicones. James F. Flynn, vice president of Carbide's silicones business and vice president of the joint venture, said he sees &quot;significant&quot; growth opportunities overseas.    Based on the contributions of each company, GE will receive 70% of the venture's profit and Carbide 30%, the companies said. The agreement, expected to be completed in the third quarter, is subject to government reviews and final corporate approvals of both companies.    Dow Corning Corp., a joint venture of Dow Chemical Co., Detroit, and Corning Glass Works, Corning, N.Y., is the world's largest silicones producer. </TEXT></DOC>
