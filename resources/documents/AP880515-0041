As part of the project, the groups have encouraged the Nepaleseto sell kerosene to the thousands of Americans and mountain loversfrom other lands who trek to Annapurna in Nepal and use up wood onthe mountainside. The Nepalese also are getting training in growingvegetables, running lodges and developing hot springs for themountain visitors.   William K. Reilly, president of the U.S. branch of the WorldWildlife Fund and the affiliated Conservation Foundation, announcedthe project last week at a news conference.   It is similar to more than 20 projects that have been startedover the past two years from Mexico to Thailand, with a grant fromthe Agency for International Development (AID). The conservationgroups have held off publicizing them until they could report somesuccess.   Annapurna is one of the world's highest, most fragile and mostbeautiful areas. It also is also one of the world's poorest areas.   The average citizen of Nepal earns about $160 dollars a year,less than 1 percent of the average U.S. income.   ``It is poverty that causes degradation of the environment morethan anything else,'' Reilly said.   Russell E. Train, chairman of their joint board of directors,said the program has had a modest success and is on the right track.   ``It has taken first steps, but they are important, satisfyingfirst steps,'' he said.   The projects still have plenty of problems.   The groups expect to cooperate with the World Bank, the majorinternational source of aid, which lends about $17 billion a yearto raise living standards in the Third World.   In recent months it has greatly enlarged its staff that dealswith the environment and paid increasing attention to environmentalissues, after much prodding from the U.S. government and privateenvironmental organizations.   It is owned by 151 countries, with the United States the biggeststockholder.   Reilly said he thought the bank, with its new interest in theenvironment, and the conservationists, with new interest in people,are moving toward one another.   ``That's fine, as long as they don't forget to drop some moneyas they go by us,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
