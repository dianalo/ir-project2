Inclusive neutron spectra were measuredfor laboratory emission angles from 3/sup 0/ to 177/sup 0/ using thetime-of-flight facility of the Hamburg isochronous cyclotron with itseight 4''diameter x 2''-Ne213 neutron scintillation detectors and flightpaths of (7.50+-0.50)m. The compound and precompound contributions tothe inclusive cross sections were separated by normalizing Ewing-Weisskopfresp. hybrid model calculations to the data in regions where these mechanismsdominate and then subtract them incoherently. The remaining componentis assigned to direct reaction mechanisms, especially the projectilebreak-up. It shows that characteristic broad continuous bump with a maximumlocated approximately at one third of the incident energy. However, thismaximum is shifted to lower or higher energies in neutron- and proton-spectra,respectively. The energy shift increases with the target proton number.Additional individual properties of the target nucleus seem to be lessimportant for the reaction mechanism. Consideration of energy shiftsin the experimental data as well as a partial wave expansion in the frameworkof the DWBA-theory indicate that the main contribution to the reactioncross section originates from a peripheral region of the nucleus withabout 10% of the central nuclear density. The angular distributions areforward peaked hence showing another characteristic of direct nuclearreactions. The anisotropic behaviour increases with the emission energybut is only slightly dependent on the entrance channel. About 50% ofthe break-up yield is emitted into the cone between 0/sup 0/ and 30/sup0/. (orig./HSI).</TEXT></DOC>
