The company, Scientific Search Project, based in New York,said it happened upon the five planes last week during thecourse of normal operations. Initial sightings indicate thatthe aircraft may be the same planes that took off from FortLauderdale, Fla., on Dec. 5, 1941, and -- despite numerousradio calls for help -- were never seen again.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;If it's true, it would solve one of the two biggestaviation mysteries,&quot; says Ted Darcy, a consultant toScientific Search and director of operations for WreckfindersCo., an aircraft salvage and research firm in Kailua, Hawaii.The disappearance of Amelia Earhart in 1937, Mr. Darcy added,has never been fully explained.   If Scientific Search can verify that the planes are indeedthe five TBM Avengers that were lost, the aircraft could beof extreme value to collectors or museums, says Robert A.Cervoni, managing director of administration. One investor,the company said, has already offered $150,000 simply for thelocation of the aircraft, regardless of whether they're thefive Navy planes.   Ownership of the planes could pose a problem. The U.S.Navy, which has long claimed title to recovered aircraft,&quot;may well come in and stake a claim,&quot; Mr. Cervoni says. Headds that Scientific Search has told the Navy of itsfindings, but hasn't received a response.   A U.S. District Court judge in Miami, at the request ofScientific Search, yesterday enjoined other parties fromexploring the site.   Mr. Cervoni says videotape of the ocean floor has alreadyprovided some evidence that the planes are the missing Navyaircraft. The number &quot;28&quot; appears on the side of one plane,which was the number of the flight leader's aircraft.Additionally, some of the planes bear the letters &quot;FT,&quot; thedesignation for aircraft flying out of Fort Lauderdale.   Verifying the serial numbers on the planes' rearstabilizers, which may occur as early as next week, shouldprovide proof of the their identities, Mr. Cervoni says.   The five aircraft took off from Fort Lauderdale at 2:10p.m. In the middle of the training mission, the flight leaderreported that the planes' compasses were no longer workingand that the aircraft were lost. The last message wasreceived at about 7 p.m. None of the 14 crew members werefound.   The disappearance helped create the riddle of the &quot;BermudaTriangle,&quot; an area of about 140,000 square miles marked bythe southern coast of the U.S., Bermuda and the GreaterAntilles. About 100 planes and vessels have been lost in theregion in the past 40 years.</TEXT></DOC>
