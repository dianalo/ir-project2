<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-34-1012 </DOCNO><TEXT>Research in high-energy physics at Iowa is in three areas--hyperon decay(ERM and CRN), hadronic interactions (Y. Onel), and charm physics (U.Mallik). In this document we report our progress in each of these areas.McCliment and Newsom built a silicon {Sigma}{sup +} and {Xi}{sup -} radiativedecays. The SSD system was extensively tested in Proton Center duringthe 1987-1988 fixed-target run. Studies included alignment, tracking,efficiency, noise, and temperature stability. Work was also completedon a measurement of the {Xi}{sup -} production polarization and magneticmoment from E715 data. A draft of the paper is included in the progressreport as Appendix A. The polarized beam line for experiment E704 wascommissioned during the same fixed-target run. Onel and his studentswere involved in running and developing the analysis for the CoulombNuclear Interaction Polarimeter. Our preliminary analysis indicates thatthe polarization beam is consistent with design expectations. During1988 we also constructed five drift chambers and a delay line chamberfor Fermilab experiment E683. We have also spent a limited amount oftime on our CERN activities in designing, planning, and doing calculationsand simulations for M258 (SPIN-SPLITTER). At MARK III, U. Mallik completedan amplitude analysis of the decay mode J/{Psi} {yields} {Omega} + f{sub2} (1270), which will soon be submitted to Physical Review D. A draftof this paper is included as Appendix B. She presented an invited talkon the MARK III results at the BNL spectroscopy conference, ``Glueballs,Hybrids, and Exotics.'' This talk will be published in the proceedings.She also worked with the e-p physics group at the Snowmass Workshop inSummer, 1988. This work will also be published in the Snowmass proceedings.Her student, Maria Roco, participated in drift chamber repair and softwareof the MARK III at SLAC in the summer of 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
