How muchwould the testimony of nearly a million political refugeesand a million political prisoners be worth? How much wouldthe testimony of hundreds of thousands killed by firing squadand poisoning be worth?   Their testimony would liken Fidel Castro's 30-plus yearsin power to the regimes of Hitler, Ceausescu and Stalin.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Schierholz's article is highly offensive because itmakes a mockery of the sufferings of Cuban martyrs. Castro'spathological &quot;revolution&quot; was meant only to keep himself inpower, while selling a policy of international adventurism tothe Soviet empire and destroying the opportunity for progressby dependence upon sugar and the dumping of Soviet oil in theworld markets.   Fidel is not Cuba. There was a Cuba before him, and therewill be one long after he is gone.   Talk to Cuba now? Yes, but to give an ultimatum: freeelections. A civilized Cuba can emerge only after history hascondemned Fidel Castro.   Felix Goizeuta   Wynnewood, Pa.   ---   Mr. Schierholz's apologia for Cuba is typical of Mr.Castro's coterie among U.S. liberals. The U.S. has nothing togain from loosening restrictions on Cuba. Castroite Cubansparticipated in the interrogation, torture and murder ofAmerican POWs in Vietnam. We should never forget that andshould do everything possible to bring to a speedy end one ofthe most heinous dictatorships the world has ever known.   We should make it a condition for any aid to Soviet Russiathat the Soviets cease all aid to Mr. Castro.   Now is no time to let up. Now is the time to bring an endfinally to Mr. Castro's regime and to free the Cuban peoplefrom his vicious yoke.   Charles T. hellmuth   Potomac, Md.   ---   Mr. Schierholz correctly addresses some of the mythsbehind U.S. policy toward Cuba. The U.S.'s go-it-alone toughpolicy might make good domestic politics, but it does littlefor democratization in Cuba. It is out of step with the restof the world.   In Cuba there is no majority favoring the embargo, muchless its expansion abroad and other measures proposed in theU.S. Congress. Even most opponents of the government call fornormalization and lifting the embargo. Because of the longhistory of the U.S.-Cuba conflict (it predates Mr. Castro),attempts to impose changes unilaterally are doomed.   Confrontation with Cuba hurts Cuban families. It onlystrengthens those who claim further openings only encouragemore U.S. pressures. The Soviets changed their policies tononinterference with their East European neighbors. Why can'tthe U.S. follow suit? Let changes take place -- whatever theymay be -- without the external threat factor.   It is time for an imaginative policy toward Cuba -- onebased on the reality on the island, not the yearnings ofideologues. It must be tempting to see Cubans as waiting fortheir deliverance with that last bit of pressure from theU.S. But things are much more complex. In the absence of newideas from Washington, the Soviets, Mexicans and the Spanishcan help. An alternative policy would find support fromsectors of the Cuban-American community. Congress should heedthese voices, not only the conservatives and their wealthypolitical-action committees.   Ramon A.
