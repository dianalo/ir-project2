National Starch andamp; Chemical Co., a unit of Anglo-Dutchconsumer giant Unilever Group, is introducing a line of sixfat replacers under the N-Lite brand, which are designed toslash the fat in a variety of processed food products. Thecompany, which will announce its innovation at a newsconference today, declined to disclose details about itsstarch-based fat substitute.</LP><TEXT>   Unilever's move represents a strategic departure from manyof its competitors, which have focused on concocting anall-purpose magic bullet. The Unilever unit, which has annualsales of $1.67 billion, elected instead to develop differentfat substitutes tailored to specific uses. Its initial sixN-Lite offerings include one product especially suited toreplace the oil in salad dressings, another that canwithstand high temperatures for use in baked goods, and athird for use in frozen foods. The Bridgewater, N.J., companyplans to eventually go beyond the half-dozen versions ofN-Lite products.   &quot;We do not believe any one product will serve all thedifferent applications required,&quot; says Gary A. Zwiercan, vicepresident of National Starch's food products division. &quot;We'vetalked to selected customers, and the response has been veryfavorable.&quot;   Researchers at Kraft General Foods, the largest foodcompany in the U.S., say they are testing the N-Lite productsand believe the new ingredients &quot;have some promise.&quot; Even so,the Philip Morris Cos. unit doesn't plan to use N-Lite fornow, and stresses that it is evaluating a slew of other fatsubstitutes. Kraft General Foods is awaiting FDA approval forits own Trailblazer substitute.   Indeed, a big challenge for N-Lite is that the market isalready thick with competitors. As Americans' fear of fat hasswelled in recent years, so have marketers' efforts toproduce a guilt-free alternative. Last year alone saw theintroduction of A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.'s Stellar, anda reformulated version of Simplesse from NutraSweet Co.Pfizer Inc. introduced Litesse and plans soon to roll outVeri-Lo, an ingredient to help manufacturers replace some ofthe fat content of their foods.   Another potential drawback is that National Starch'stechnology isn't exactly novel. The version of N-Liteintended to supplant shortening in icings, for example, isbased on oldfangled ingredients such as nonfat dried milk andguar gum. Because the N-Lite products are made of ingredientsgenerally accepted as safe, they don't need FDA approval. ButMel Wolkstein, a consultant at Reach Associates in SouthOrange, N.J., is skeptical that such lowtech goods will beable to command premium prices.   National Starch officials wouldn't provide specifics onthe technology or pricing of N-Lite. The company, whichprovides starches to the food industry, has sold for severalyears a tapioca-based fat replacer, called N-Oil, for frozendesserts and salad dressings.   Despite the plethora of artificial fats now available,food manufacturers say they have yet to find an easy-to-useingredient that successfully duplicates the complex taste andtexture -- the so-called mouth feel -- of real fat.   Topping the list of disappointments is Simplesse, the fatsubstitute announced by NutraSweet in 1988. The Monsanto Co.unit spent more than $100 million to develop and marketSimplesse, but many food-industry executives have alreadywritten off the ingredient as costing too much but deliveringtoo little. Food executives are also frustrated that Procterandamp; Gamble Co.'s much-awaited Olestra synthetic fat has yet toreceive FDA clearance for any use.   What keeps the fat substitute merchants going is thepotential payoff. In the U.S. alone, food processors use 16billion pounds of fat annually. Industry executives estimatethat the potential market for artificial fats now totals onlyseveral hundred million dollars a year and could easilysurpass $1 billion by the end of the decade.   Because the market is still so nascent, even competitorsconcede that N-Lite is likely to make an initial splash. &quot;Themarketplace is screaming out for a high-performance fatreplacer,&quot; says Daniel Rizzo, director of new products atA.E. Staley, a unit of Tate andamp; Lyle PLC. &quot;Anybody that comesout with anything in the category will at least get theattention of food manufacturers.&quot;   ---           Major Players in the Fake Fat Market                                                                                                        COMPANY           BRAND                  STATUS                                                                                                        National Starch   N-Lite         Introduced Jan. 1992;                                  available for commercial                                  use                                                                                                        Hercules          Slendid        Introduced Sept. 1991;                                  available for commercial                                  use                                                                                                        NutraSweet (Monsanto)        Simplesse 100  Introduced Aug. 1991;                                  available for commercial                                  use                   Simplesse 300  Received FDA approval in                                  1990 for use in frozen                                  desserts only                                                                                                        A.E.
