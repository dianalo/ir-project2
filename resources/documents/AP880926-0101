(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two Indian activists went to court todayfor their trial on charges of taking hostages at a newspaper inwhat they say was an effort to spotlight local corruption, but onewas without his regular lawyer.   Defense lawyers have said they will argue that Eddie Hatcher andTimothy Jacobs acted out of necessity when up to 20 people weretaken hostage at The Robesonian on Feb. 1.   U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle today denied a request for acontinuance in the trial, even though Hatcher's attorney, WilliamKunstler, was not present because he is involved in another trialin New York. Hatcher had said repeatedly he would not participatein the trial without Kunstler.   ``I will not be there,'' Kunstler, famed for his defense ofleftist causes, said last week. ``Eddie will not have a lawyer. Hewill, I think ... stand up and tell that jury at every opportunitythat he is there without a lawyer.''   When he granted a third delay in the case Aug. 1, Boyle warnedHatcher that he did not intend to continue the case again and saidanother lawyer should be prepared to begin the trial if Kunstlerwas not present.   But lawyer Barry Nakell asked the judge today to delay the trialuntil Oct. 18, when Kunstler should be through with the other case.Hatcher has said he does not want Nakell as his attorney at thetrial, though Nakell has represented him in some other hearings.   The judge turned down Nakell's request.   The defendants are charged with hostage-taking and manufacturingillegal weapons.   Hatcher, 31, and Jacobs, 20, have never denied that they tookover the offices of The Robesonian in Lumberton, but say they didso to draw attention to their allegations of discrimination againstminorities and drug trafficking by local law enforcement agencies.   They say they were driven to commit ``an act of desperation''because their knowledge of the drug trafficking had put their livesin danger.   ``We have a necessity defense in this case ... (which) involvesshowing that neither Timothy or Eddie had any legal alternatives towhat they did and that they were in fear of their lives on Feb.1,'' Bob Warren, Jacobs' attorney, said last week.   The 10-hour siege at the newspaper ended after Gov. Jim Martinagreed to form a state task force to investigate their charges.   But Hatcher and Jacobs, who say they are Tuscarora Indians, metonly once with the task force, which issued a preliminary reportsaying it had found little evidence to back up their charges.   Hatcher, Jacobs and their supporters said the task force did notdo a thorough investigation and that potential witnesses would nottestify without federal and state immunity.   The defendants' lawyers have conducted their own investigationand say they have potential witnesses who could back up the chargesof official wrongdoing.   Hatcher disappeared Aug. 31 after a federal appeals courtrevoked his bond. Jacobs surrendered to marshals the same day.Hatcher was arrested at Raleigh-Durham Airport one week ago when hestepped off a plane with a Kunstler associate.</TEXT></DOC>
