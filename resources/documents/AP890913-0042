The hearing came as several other subcommittee's were makinglast-minute adjustments Tuesday to oil spill cleanup legislationarising from the tanker Exxon Valdez accident that fouled Alaska'sPrince William Sound. Full committee and House action may occurlater this week.   Supporters of drilling say the risk from offshore drilling is farless than that from tankers, pointing out there hasn't had a majorspill from offshore drilling since major spills and fires in 1969and 1970 forced federal attention on the industry.   But opponents say there are too many environmental hazardsassociated with drilling, including destruction of wetlands forpipelines and facilities, and air and noise pollution. The impact ondomestic fuel production would be relatively small, they say.   ``Predictions are that offshore areas recommended for off limitscontain only 10 percent of all estimated offshore and gasresources,'' said Bolze, quoting a private study based on InteriorDepartment data.   She said increasing the mileage standards of passenger vehicles``to currently technically feasible levels would produce oil savingsequal to the amount of undiscovered oil resources estimated toexist'' in the Outer Continental Shelf.   Environmentalists want to ban drilling at Georges Bank off NewEngland, the Florida Keys, Bristol Bay of Alaska, some areas ofnorthern and southern California, and areas in the Mid-Atlantic.   A Bush administration task force is studying some of the morecontroversial lease sales off Florida and the Gulf Coast and isexpected to make recommendations to President Bush in December.   Bolze testified at a hearing of the Panama Canal and OuterContinental Shelf subcommittee, which is examining the environmentalimpact of such drilling as a result of the Valdez tanker spill.   Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, said barring offshore drilling wouldput the country's shoreline at greater environmental risk fromincreased tanker traffic, particularly foreign ships.   ``Since the average offshore well in the Gulf of Mexico producesonly eight barrels of oil per hour, in order to duplicate the Valdezspill all the wells in the Gulf of Mexico multiplied by three wouldhave to simultaneously blow out,'' said Fields.   ``If we don't move forward with a domestic OCS program, ourcountry is going to suffer in the future,'' he said.   Most OCS production is in the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific Oceanoff California. An administration task force is studying some of themore controversial lease sales off Florida and the Gulf coast ofFlorida and is expected to make recommendations to President Bush inDecember.   Barry A. Williamson, director of minerals management for theInterior Department, said 8 billion gallons of oil and 75 trillioncubic feet of natural gas have been produced over the 36 years ofOCS drilling.   He said that is about one-eighth of U.S. oil production andone-fourth of natural gas production.</TEXT></DOC>
