As Americans today ponder the terrible line theU.S. must soon cross in the Gulf, we may again find someguidance in the words of the Athenians and the examples theyset.   The Greek historian Thucydides, master of war andstrategy, thought long and carefully about the consequencesof conflict. Perhaps the most moving passages in his accountof the Peloponnesian War come in his report of a speechPericles made in 430 B.C.</LP><TEXT>   Pericles sought to honor the Athenians who had died in thefirst year of the war with Sparta. These passages speakdirectly to the problems we confront in the Gulf, as well asto the nature of sacrifice we may ask a large number of youngmen and women to make. Pericles argued in particular that theenormous difference between the government of Athens and itsenemy, Sparta, was one of the causes of war:   ---   &quot;Our constitution is called a democracy because power isin the hands not of a minority, but of the whole people. Whenit is a question of settling private disputes, everyone isequal before the law; when it is a question of putting oneperson before another in positions of public responsibility,what counts is not membership of a particular class, but theactual ability which the man possesses. No one, so long as hehas it in him to be of service to the state, is kept inpolitical obscurity because of poverty. And, just as ourpolitical life is free and open, so is our day-to-day life inour relations with each other. . . .   &quot;We are free and tolerant in our private lives; but inpublic affairs we keep to the law. This is because itcommands our deep respect. . . .   &quot;Our city is open to the world, and we have no periodicdeportations in order to prevent people observing or findingout secrets. . . . This is because we rely, not on secretweapons, but on our own real courage and loyalty. . . . Ourlove of what is beautiful does not lend to extravagance; ourlove of things of the mind does not make us soft. We regardwealth as something to be properly used rather than assomething to boast about. As for poverty, no one need beashamed to admit it: the real shame is in not takingpractical measures to escape from it.   &quot;Here each individual is interested not only in his ownaffairs but in the affairs of state as well. . . . WeAthenians, in our own persons, take our decisions on policyor submit them to proper discussion; for we do not think thatthere is an incompatibility between word and deed; the worstthing is to rush into action before the consequences havebeen properly debated.&quot;   ---   As we think about the coming war, we should not lose sightof who we are and what the basic issues are in the Gulf.Americans should remember that while the U.S. has debated theissue, there has been no debate, no open dissent, in Iraq.Many dissenting Iraqis are dead or in exile. In gloomyacquiescence, Iraqis have once again bowed to the gun barrelof their tyrant.   ---   &quot;{T}his is another point where we differ from otherpeople. We are capable at the same time of taking risks andof estimating them beforehand. Others are brave out ofignorance. . . . But the man who can most truly be accountedbrave is he who knows best the meaning of what is sweet inlife and of what is terrible and then goes out determined tomeet what is to come.   &quot;Taking everything together, then, I declare that our cityis an education to Greece. . . .&quot;   ---   However evil Saddam Hussein's tyranny, the crucial pointis that we confront an individual with megalomaniacal dreams:nothing less than the expunging of Western influences fromthe Arab world, with all the consequences that such anachievement would entail. Like Hitler, he is not aiming atsome minor changes in borders to adjust old wrongs done tohis nation. Kuwait, like Czechoslovakia in 1938, is only astopover on a long journey.   While Saddam is happy to mouth for the benefit of thegullible in the West that Kuwait was stolen from Iraq byBritish imperialism, he aims to control the entire Gulfregion as a stepping stone for future goals. His designsencompass the elimination of Israel and its Jews. But, it canbe argued, Saddam wants to go further. He may even seek acomplete reversal of the West's rise in the 19th and 20thcenturies. As Saddam has said, he would sooner see World WarIII start than yield power to us and our allies voluntarily.   ---   &quot;This, then, is the kind of city for which these men, whocould not bear the thought of losing her, nobly fought andnobly died. . . . To me it seems that the consummation whichhad overtaken these men shows us the meaning of {courage andnobility} in its first revelation and final proof. Some ofthem, no doubt, had their faults; but what we ought toremember first is their gallant conduct against the enemy indefense of their native land. They have blotted out evil withgood, and done more service to the commonwealth than theyever did harm in their private lives. No one of these menweakened because he wanted to go on enjoying his wealth: noone put off the awful day in the hope that he might escapehis poverty and grow rich. . . .   &quot;So they fled from the reproaches of men, abiding withlife and limb the brunt of battle; and, in a small moment oftime, the climax of their lives, a culmination of glory, notof fear, were swept away from us.&quot;   ---   Mr. Murray is a professor of history at Ohio StateUniversity.
