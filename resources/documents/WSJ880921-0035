The Framingham, Mass., biotechnology concern said the test uses a color change to indicate the presense of the common food-borne microorganism that can cause serious gastrointestinal disease.    The food-processing industry spends an estimated $40 million to $50 million a year for salmonella testing, according to Integrated Genetics. The new Gene-Trak test identifies salmonella in food products in less than 48 hours, compared with five-to-seven days for conventional microbiology methods, the company said.    DNA probes are small pieces of genetic material that stick to and reveal the DNA of specific organisms. Gene-Trak last month introduced a DNA-probe test for E. coli bacteria in food. </TEXT></DOC>
