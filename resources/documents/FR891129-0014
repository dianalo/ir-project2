Background</ITAG>A. Statutory AuthorityThe over-all objective of the Clean Water Act (CWA) as amended is to restoreand maintain the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the Nation'swater. The two national goals the Act established in 1972 include: (1)Eliminating the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters; and (2)achieving and interim water quality level that would protect fish, shellfish,and wildlife while providing for recreation in and on the water whereverattainable.Since 1972, section 101(b) of the CWA makes it national policy to recognizeand preserve the States' primary responsibility to meet these goals. Overthe past 17 years, the Agency has focused on developing standard operatingrelationships with the States and localities.Congress, through amendments to both CWA in 1987 and the Safe DrinkingWater Act (SDWA) in 1986, has authorized EPA to treat Indian Tribes asStates under various provisions of these Acts. Amendments to both statutesrequired the Agency to promulgate regulations that would establish exactlyhow Tribes would be treated as States.The February 4, 1987 amendments to the CWA added a new section 518 entitled``Indian Tribes.'' These Amendments authorize EPA to treat Indian Tribesas States for the purposes of certain provisions of the Act, and providegrant and contract assistance (for certain of these programs) to IndianTribes where appropriate. The Amendments require EPA to promulgate regulationsspecifying how the Agency will treat an Indian Tribe as a State under thefollowing provisions: Title II (Construction Grants), section 104 (Research,Investigation and Training), section 106 (Grants for Pollution Control),section 303 (Water Quality Standards and Implementation Plans), section305 (Water Quality Inventory), section 308 (Inspections, Monitoring, andEntry), section 309 (Federal Enforcement), section 314 (Clean Lakes), section319 (Nonpoint Source), section 401 (Certification, section 402 (NationalPollutant Discharge Elimination System), and section 404 (Dredge and FillPermit Program.)Section 518(e) of the Clean Water Act establishes certain criteria an IndianTribe must meet before treatment as a State is authorized: (1) ``The IndianTribe has a governing body carrying out substantial governmental dutiesand powers;'' (2) ``the functions to be exercised by the Indian Tribe pertainto the management and protection of water resources which are held by anIndian Tribe, held by the United States in trust for Indians, held by memberof an Indian Tribe if such property interest is subject to a trust restrictionon alienation or otherwise within the boundaries of a reservation''; and(3) ``the Indian Tribe is reasonably expected to be capable, in the Administrator'sjudgment, of carrying out the functions to be exercised in a manner consistentwith the terms and purposes of the Act and of all applicable regulations.''In addition to the eligibility requirements specified in section 518(e),section 518(h)(2) defines Indian Tribes as follows: ``Indian Tribe meansany Indian Tribe, band, group, or community recognized by the Secretaryof Interior and exercising governmental authority over a Federal Indianreservation.'' Consequently, Federal recognition and governmental authorityover reservation lands are necessary criteria by definition.B. Development of This RuleBased on the statutory amendments to the CWA, there are currently regulationsrelated to five separate CWA programs at different stages of developmentin the Agency: (1) Construction Grants program, (2) Water Quality Standardsprogram (including the required conflict resolution mechanism), (3) Dredgeand Fill Permit program on Indian lands, (4) National Pollution DischargeElimination System permit program on Indian lands, and (5) CWA grants programsfor Indian lands. To promote consistency among the various regulationsbeing developed, an intra-Agency oversight committee was established. Effortsare being made by this committee to develop parallel requirements whereappropriate in order to reduce the burden on Tribes that choose to applyfor any of these programs.EPA has already issued regulations: (1) Specifying how Indian Tribes willbe treated as States for purposes of the Public Water System and UndergroundInjection Control (UIC) programs under the SDWA (53 FR 37396) (referredto below as the ``SDWA Indian Primacy Rule''), and (2) promulgating FederalUIC programs on all Indian lands where an applicable program had not beenin place (53 FR 43084). The SDWA Indian Primacy Rule is being used as amodel for developing parallel regulatory approaches in the forthcomingCWA Indian regulations. The CWA Indian grant regulations were also recentlypromulgated in interim final form (54 FR 14354).Section 518(e) of the CWA requires consultation with Indian Tribes duringregulations development. The CWA also requires the Administrator to consultaffected States sharing common water bodies and provide a mechanism forthe resolution of any unreasonable consequences that may arise as a resultof differing water quality standards that may be set by States and Tribeslocated on common bodies of water.In keeping with this requirement, the Agency decided a multifaceted consultationapproach would be most appropriate. Tribal and State representatives wereappointed to serve on various CWA Indian workgroups. For the most part,workgroup meetings have been noticed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> inviting the public to observe and offer comment.Other efforts to consult with Tribes and States have included nationalmeetings across the country to discuss the regulatory approaches proposedin the various CWA regulations, EPA officials attendance at both Tribaland interested State meetings to present regulatory approaches being considered,and distribution of the draft proposed language for broad review at anearly stage of the regulation development.C. EPA Indian PolicyThis rule is consistent with Federal Policy statements regarding IndianTribes. On January 24, 1983, the Federal government established an IndianPolicy Statement providing for treatment of Tribal governments on a government-to-governmentbasis and supporting the principle of self-determination and local decision-makingby Indian Tribes.The EPA's policy is ``to give special consideration to Tribal interestsin making Agency policy and to ensure the close involvement of Tribal governmentsin making decisions and managing the environmental programs affecting reservationlands.'' In practice, EPA's policy is to work directly with Tribal governmentsas independent authorities for reservation affairs, recognizing that theyare not political subdivisions of States.D. Supplemental Statutory BackgroundIn 1972, Congress established the 404 permit program to regulate dischargesof dredged or fill material into waters of the United States. Congressin the 1977 Amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control act (theClean Water Act), gave States the option of assuming the 404 permit programin certain waters of the State, subject to EPA approval (section 404 (g)-(1)).If a State assumes this responsibility, its jurisdiction includes all waterswithin its border except (1) those which are subject to the ebb and flowof the tide plus adjacent wetlands and (2) waters which are presently usedor may be susceptible to use (through reasonable improvement) to transportinterstate or foreign commerce plus adjacent wetlands. The Corps retainsjurisdiction over all waters which States cannot assume.The Act prescribes minimum requirements which States must meet before exercisingtheir option to assume the program and assigned program approval and oversightresponsibility to EPA. On May 19, 1980, EPA promulgated regulations toestablish procedures and criteria for approval/disapproval of 404 Stateprograms and for monitoring a State program after program approval. Inresponse to State concerns about rigid mandatory requirements, excessivepaperwork burdens, intrusive Federal oversight, and general lack of flexibility,EPA promulgated revised regulations on June 6, 1988. These revisions providethe States more flexibility in program design and administration whilestill meeting the requirements and objectives of the Act. Once a Tribeis determined to be a State, the Tribe must meet the requirements for anapproval program specified in 40 CFR part 233.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary and Explanation of Today's Action</ITAG>Today's proposed rule would implement section 518 of the CWA which authorizesEPA to treat an Indian Tribe as a State for assumption of the dredge andfill permit program if the Indian Tribe meets the eligibility criteria.The criteria for treating Indian tribes as States under the CWA and theSDWA are very similar. The Agency intends to establish the least burdensomeprocess possible for Tribes to demonstrate State eligibility. When mostor all regulations under the SDWA and CWA stipulating how Tribes shallbe treated as States are final, the Agency will develop procedures to implementa single application procedure for the SDWA and CWA programs for thoseaspects that are similar under both statutes.Most qualification criteria are of a general nature and need only be providedwhen a Tribe first applies for ``treatment as a State'' under the SDWAor CWA. For example, the ``Federal recognition'' and ``governmental dutiesand powers'' criteria will usually require the same showing for a Tribeand would ordinarily need to be demonstrated only during the first applicationa Tribe submitted under either of the Acts.However, the Agency believes that even with a streamlined application procedure,some qualifications will still need to be demonstrated separately for eachprogram, particularly regarding capability. For example, a Tribe may possessthe requisite capability to establish water quality standards but not toassume the Dredge and Fill Permit Program. Yet the Agency does not wishto put Tribes through the burden of filing complete applications for treatmentas a State for each separate program. Consequently, the Agency will allowIndian Tribes which have previously been designated as a State under eitherSDWA or CWA to provide only that information which is unique to the specificadditional program(s) (which may include demonstrating adequate regulatoryauthority to administer the specific program) the Tribe is applying for.Requirements which may be unique for the dredge and fill program are andSection;233.61(d) (4) and (5).As is the case for States, an Indian Tribe must have its own legal authoritiesto administer a program under the CWA; EPA cannot delegate its own authority.However, the Agency considered whether the lack of comprehensive criminalenforcement authority would preclude Tribes from applying for the NationalPollution Discharge Elimination System (section 402) and the Dredge andFill Permit programs (section 404) that currently require such authorityfor an approvable State program.Section 1451 of SDWA specifically states that Indian Tribes are not requiredto exercise criminal enforcement jurisdiction for primary enforcement responsibility.The CWA amendments, however, do not include similar language indicatingwhether it would be appropriate to treat a Tribe not having criminal enforcementauthority over all individuals on the reservation as a State where suchauthority is currently required for State program assumption.The Agency realizes that a comprehensive criminal enforcement requirementcould raise substantial impediments to Tribal assumption of those CWA programsthat require such authorities of States. Federal law bars Indian Tribesfrom criminally trying or punishing non-Indians in the absence of a treatyor other agreement to the contrary. <T3>Oliphant</T3> v. <T3>Suquamish Indian Tribe</T3> 435 U.S. 191 (1978). In addition, the FederalIndian Civil Rights Act prohibits any Indian court or tribunal from imposingany criminal fine greater than $5,000 (25 U.S.C. 1302(7)).The Agency believes that even though Congress did not explicitly waivethe requirement under CWA, as under SDWA, that Congress nonetheless intendedTribes to be able to obtain primacy without demonstrating comprehensivecriminal enforcement authority. If EPA were to infer that Congress, byfailing to insert language similar to that contained in section 1451 ofSDWA, intended not to waive the criminal enforcement requirement, EPA'sreading would make part of section 518 of CWA a nullity, since absent furtherlegislative action, no Tribe would be able to assume a program under 402or 404 of CWA. This reading would contradict the apparent intent of section518 to allow Tribes to assume all specified CWA programs where they meetthe section 518(e) criteria and further would violate two traditional rulesof statutory construction: (1) Legislation should not be interpreted asbeing meaningless, if at all possible; and (2) ambiguous statutes shouldbe interpreted to the benefit of the Tribes.Section 233.41 of the 404 State Program Regulations (SPR) requires thata State have criminal enforcement authority to have an approvable 404 Stateprogram. This notice proposes to amend the existing regulations so thatTribes will not be required to exercise comprehensive criminal enforcementjurisdiction as a condition to assuming the 404 program. Tribes would,instead, be required to provide for the referral of criminal enforcementmatters when Tribal enforcement authority does not exist (e.g., non-Indiansor fines over $5,000) to EPA and/or the Corps, as the parties agree inan appropriate and timely manner. Such procedures must be established ina formal Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Regional Administratorand/or the appropriate District Engineer(s) of the Corps. There may bea single MOA among the tribe, EPA and the Corps; separate MOA's betweenthe Tribe and EPA and the Tribe and the Corps; or only one MOA, betweenthe Tribe and EPA or the Corps, if the parties so agree. The MOA(s) usedto satisfy this agreement may, but do not have to be, the same as thoserequired in 40 CFR 233.13 and 233.14.Thus, the lack of comprehensive Tribal criminal enforcement authority shouldnot prevent a Tribe from having an approvable 404 State program.We are particularly interested in receiving comments and/or suggestionsfrom the Tribes on establishing procedures to effectively and efficientlyhandle the referral of the criminal enforcement cases over which the Tribesdo not have enforcement authority.Because CWA program funds are limited, many Indian Tribes may decide itis not cost-effective or otherwise beneficial to apply for various CWAprogram authorities. The Agency encourages Tribes to carefully considerwhich of the available programs would be beneficial to assume and to targetthe Tribal efforts and resources towards those specific programs. The Agencynotes that Tribal assumption of the CWA program discussed in today's ruleis voluntary on the part of the Tribes.In order to facilitate consistent implementation of the requirements ofCWA, an Indian Tribe and the State or States adjacent to the lands of suchTribe are located may enter into a cooperative agreement, subject to thereview and approval of the Administrator, to jointly plan and administerthe requirements of this Act (see section 518(d) of the CWA.)The Agency highly encourages such cooperative agreements, because of therelative benefits such as information and resource sharing. The Agencydoes not have any specific criteria that a cooperative agreement must meet,so long as all parties involved approve it and it complies with the intentand administrative requirements of CWA. In situations where EPA is a signatoryto a cooperative agreement, all Federal requirements that govern such agreementsmust also be met.Draft cooperative agreements should be submitted to the Regional Administratorfor review and approval. If necessary, the Agency will develop guidanceto assist the Tribes and states in developing cooperative agreements.A. Treatment of Indian Tribes as StatesThis rule would create procedures for Indian Tribes to apply to EPA fortreatment as a State in order to be eligible to subsequently apply forassumption of the dredge and fill permit program as provided under section404(g)-(1). This rule revises 40 CFR part 230 and creates a new subpartG of part 233. A new subpart G of 40 CFR part 233 establishes criteriaIndian Tribes must meet for treatment as a State, lists the informationthe Tribe must provide in its application to EPA, and provides a procedurefor formal EPA review of applications for ``treatment as a State.'' Therequirements a Tribe must meet under all the CWA Indian regulations areas similar as possible leaving room for program specific requirements whichare explained further in the capability requirements section of this notice.As mentioned previously, Section 518 of the CWA stipulates that a Tribeis eligible for treatment as a State if it meets the following criteria:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Is Federally recognized;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) It carries out substantial governmental duties and powers overa Federal Indian reservation;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Has appropriate regulatory authority over surface waters of thereservation; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Is reasonably expected to be capable of administering the relevantCWA program;</ITAG>The Agency believes the language in Section 518 requires that each of theseelibility criteria be satisfied through a separate demonstration by a Tribefollowing the procedures these regulations will set forth. These proceduresare intended to ensure Tribes who are treated as States meet the requirementsin the CWA not to act as a barrier to program assumption. The Agency hopesthat as many Tribes as possible will assume responsibility for the CWAprograms where the Tribe and the Agency deem it appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Federal Recognition</ITAG>With respect to Federal recognition as an Indian Tribe, the Secretary ofthe Interior periodically publishes a list of Federally recognized Tribes.If the applicant appears on this list it need only state that this is so.If the Tribal name does not appear on this list because the list has notbeen updated, the Tribe can still provide appropriate documentation toEPA verifying that it is Federally recognized by the Secretary of Interior.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. ``Substantial Governmental Duties and Powers''</ITAG>In addition, a Tribe must satisfy the second criteria that the Tribe is``carrying out substantial governmental duties and powers.'' The Agencydefines ``substantial governmental duties and powers'' to mean that theTribe is currently performing governmental functions to promote the publichealth, safety, and welfare [of the affected population] within a definedgeographical area.Many Indian Tribal governments perform functions traditionally performedby sovereign governments. Examples of such functions include, but are notlimited to, levying tax, acquiring land by exercising the power of eminentdomain, and police power (i.e., providing for the public health, safety,and general welfare of the affected population). Based on comments on theSDWA Indian Primary rule, the Agency believes that most Tribes will beable to meet these criteria without much difficulty. (See 53 FR 37399).The Agency intends to minimize the burdens to a Tribe to demonstrate thatit carries out substantial governmental duties and powers. The Agency proposesto require a narrative statement: (1) Describing the form of Tribal government;(2) describing the types of essential governmental functions currentlyperformed such as those listed above; and (3) identifying the legal authoritiesfor performing these functions (e.g., Tribal constitutions, codes, etc.).The Agency merely intends the functions listed above (e.g., police powersaffecting the health, safety and welfare, taxation, and power of eminentdomain) as examples. It is not necessary that an applicant be currentlyperforming each such function to qualify for treatment as State. The Agencyintends only to require sufficient documentation to determine whether aTribe satisfies the statutory requirement of ``carrying out substantialgovernmental duties and powers.''<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Jurisdiction</ITAG>The third requirement a Tribe must meet for treatment as a State is that``the functions to be exercised by the Tribe must pertain to the managementand protection of water resources which are held by an Indian Tribe, heldby the United States in trust for Indians, held by a member of an IndianTribe if such property interest is subject to a trust restriction on alienation,or otherwise within the boundaries of a reservation.''This provision contains different language than that of section 1451(a)(2)SDWA which states: ``The functions to be exercised by the Indian Tribeare within the area of the Tribal Government's jurisdiction.'' WhereasCWA section 518 language suggests that Tribes may only regulate those waterresources which are within the exterior boundaries of a Federal Indianreservation, the parallel SDWA provision makes no such explicit limitation.As a result of this different statutory definition under SDWA, Tribes arenot precluded from applying for treatment as a State for any lands overwhich the Tribe believes it has regulatory authority. (See 53 FR 37400.)The CWA establishes a somewhat narrower part of Indian country for whichEPA will recognize Tribal authority by restricting Tribal eligibility fortreatment as a State to lands ``otherwise within reservation boundaries.''The Agency anticipates that this language may reduce the potential fordisputes since authority to regulate within boundaries is more readilydetermined.Comments received on the SDWA primacy regulations suggest that Tribes shouldnot face the burden of proving their jurisdiction, i.e., that they shouldreceive the same general recognition of sovereign authority that EPA accordsStates. The Agency recognizes that there is substantial support for thegeneral proposition that a Tribal government has authority to administerCWA programs within the exterior boundaries of the Tribe's reservation.The Agency does not believe, however, that it is appropriate to establisha rebuttable presumption concerning Tribal governmental authority. Justas when EPA considers a State application, EPA must not delegate programresponsibility to a Tribe unless the Tribe can adequately show it possessesthe requisite authority.The Agency recognizes that there may be some disputes regarding the extentof Tribal authority to administer CWA programs and therefore believes itnecessary to require documentation to demonstrate adequate authority byTribes applying for CWA programs. The request that a given Tribe establishits authority to administer CWA programs is not meant to be a barrier ora deterrent to that Tribe's attainment of these programs. Rather the intentof these requirements is to raise at an early date the presence or absenceof a key element to effective administration of CWA programs.The process the Agency proposes to establish for Tribes to demonstratetheir authority includes the submission of a statement signed by the TribalAttorney General or an equivalent official explaining the legal basis forthe Tribe's regulatory authority to administer the desired program(s).The statement is similar to the statement currently required of Statesapplying for 404 program assumption (40 CFR 233.12). The Attorney General'sstatement will supplement the other documentation mentioned in andSection;233.61 of this proposed rule (e.g., a map, copies of tribal codes and ordinances,etc.). The Attorney General's statement with the supporting documentationwill assist EPA in verifying that the Tribe has the necessary authorityto administer the appropriate CWA program.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Tribal Capability</ITAG>The fourth criterion that a Tribe must meet is that, in the Administrator'sjudgment, the Tribe must be ``reasonably expected to be capable'' of administeringan effective program. In evaluating a Tribe's demonstration that it is``reasonably expected to be capable'' of administering an effective dredgeand fill permit program, the Administrator will consider from among thefollowing five factors those which are appropriate for the dredge and fillpermit program:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The Tribe's previous management experience;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Existing environmental or public health programs administeredby the Tribe;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The mechanism(s) in place for carrying out the executive, legislative,and judicial functions of the Tribal government;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) The relationship between regulated entities and the administrativeagency of the Tribal government which is, or will be, designated as theprimacy agent; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) The technical and administrative capabilities of the staff toadminister and manage the program.</ITAG>The Agency recognizes that certain Tribes may not have substantial experiencein administering environmental programs. Although lack of this experiencewill not preclude a Tribe from demonstrating the required capability, thepresence of such experience will be of significant importance to the Agency.The EPA proposes to request information on the Tribe's executive, legislative,and judicial functions to assure that the Tribe has the capability to administera program approved under the Clean Water Act.The EPA's evaluation of the Tribe's capability will also consider the relationshipbetween the existing or proposed Tribal agency which will assume the dredgeand fill permit program and any potential regulated Tribal entities.A common situation among Indian Tribes is that the Tribe is both the regulatorand regulatee. Such a situation could result in a conflict of interestif EPA delegated the program to the Tribe, since the Tribe would be regulatingitself. The Agency believes that independence of the regulator and regulateeis necessary to assure effective and fair administration of these programs.This approach is not meant to require the Tribes to divest themselves ofownership of any regulated entities it owns or operates. One possible solutionto the problem could be the creation of an independent organization toregulate Tribal entities subject to CWA regulatory requirements. Similararrangements could be established utilizing existing Tribal organizations.Failure to resolve the regulator/regulatee conflict will not preclude aTribe from being eligible for treatment as a State but is intended to alertTribes at an early date about a potential bar to regulatory program assumptionthat must be resolved. Resolution of the regulator/regulatee issue relativeto the CWA programs will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. EPA doesnot intend to limit Tribal flexibility in creating structures which willensure adequate separation of the regulator and the regulated entity.The Agency is aware that, in limited cases, States also are in a similarsituation of being both regulator and regulatee. However, State infrastructuresare typically such that the State agency operating the regulated entityis not the same State agency that has primary enforcement authority. Thisis in contrast to the typical situation exhibited by Indian Tribes whichmay own and operate most or all regulated entities.The Agency encourages smaller Tribes to consider consortiums or intertribalagencies as ways to obtain the necessary expertise to administer theseprograms and to make the attainment of primacy cost-effective and beneficialto the Tribe. The Agency will consider and evaluate all applications itreceives, regardless of the applicant's size, on a case-by-case basis.Although EPA will consider applications by a group or consortium of Tribeswithin the same geographical area, each applicant must still meet all eligibilityrequirements to be treated as a State, particularly the jurisdictionalrequirement.B. Process for Evaluating ApplicationsWithin thirty days after receipt of a Tribe's complete application fortreatment as a State (which has all the information required in andSection;233.60), EPA will notify appropriate governmental entities (e.g., neighboringTribal and State governments) of the receipt of the application and thesubstance of and basis for the Tribe's assertion of authority over reservationwaters.Each of the governmental entities will have thirty days after receipt ofthe notice to submit comments to EPA. Comments will be limited solely tothe issue of the Tribe's showing under Section 518(e)(2). EPA will notconsider comments directed to whether the Tribe meets EPA's other requirementsfor treatment as a State.If an Indian Tribe's assertion under 518(e)(2) is subjected to a competingclaim, the Administrator will consult with the Tribe, the governmentalentity submitting comments, and the Secretary of the Department of theInterior, or his designee. After consultation, and in consideration ofcomments received, the Administrator will determine whether the Tribe hasadequately demonstrated that it meets the requirements of section 518(e)(2).If the Administrator concludes that a Tribe has not adequately demonstratedits authority with respect to certain reservation waters, then Tribal assumptionof the dredge and fill permit program will be restricted accordingly. Anysuch determination by the Administrator is not a determination of the Tribe'sgeneral regulatory authority but only with respect to administration ofthe 404 program. A dispute over a certain area over which a Tribe is assertingauthority will not necessarily delay the Agency's decision to treat a Tribeas a State for the non-disputed areas.This procedure does not imply that States or Federal agencies have vetopower over Tribal applications for treatment as a State. Rather, the procedureis simply intended to ensure that the Tribe has the necessary authorityto administer the dredge and fill permit program. The Agency will not relysolely on the assertions of a competing regulatory authority; it will makean independent evaluation of the Tribal showing.The Agency does not believe it will be possible to approve or disapproveall applications for ``treatment as a State'' within a designated timeframe. The Agency fully anticipates that there will be instances wherethe determinations under section 518 (e)(2) and (e)(3) will require theAgency to go back to a Tribe for clarification or additional information.Likewise, the Agency's experience with States applying for various EPAprograms indicates that at times meetings and discussions between EPA andthe State are necessary before all requirements are met. The Agency believesthat the same process of communication with Tribes will be beneficial inensuring that Tribes meet the ``treatment as a State'' criteria in an expeditiousmanner.A determination by the Administrator that a Tribe does not meet the requirementsfor treatment as a State does not preclude the Tribe from resubmittingthe application at a future date. If the Administrator determines thata Tribal application is deficient or incomplete, the Tribe should consultwith EPA on what changes are necessary.<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Other Issues_Alaska Native Villages and Oklahoma Tribes</ITAG>Under section 518 of the CWA, the Agency concludes that Alaska Native Villages(except for the Annette Island Reserve of the Metlakatla Indian Community)are not eligible to apply for treatment as a State based on the definitionof Indian Tribes. The Act uses the following definition in section 518(h):(1) ``Federal Indian reservation'' means all lands within the limits ofany reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States Government,notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and including rights-of-wayrunning through the reservation; and (2) ``Indian Tribe'' means any Tribe,band, group, or community recognized by the Secretary of the Interior andexercising governmental authority over a <T3>Federal Indian reservation.</T3>'' [emphasis added] Since Alaska NativeVillages do not exercise authority over reservations, under the terms ofthe CWA they are not ``Tribes'' for purposes of section 518(e).The Agency's conclusion is based on the fact that since passage of theAlaska Native Claims Settlement Act (25 U.S.C. 1618) in 1971, Alaska NativeVillages, with one limited exception, do not exercise governmental authorityover a Federal Indian reservation. This lack of authority prevents AlaskaNative Villages from being eligible to receive grants or assume programsunder section 518 of the Act.Section 518(g) of the CWA does not affect EPA's analysis of the statusof Alaska Native Villages. Section 518(g) states that * * * no provisionsof this Act shall be construed to_<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) grant, enlarge, or diminish, or in any way affect the scope ofthe governmental authority, if any, of any Alaska Native organization,including any federally recognized tribe, traditional Alaska Native council,or Native Council organized pursuant to the Act of June 1, 1934 (48 Stat.987), over lands or persons in Alaska;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) create or validate any assertion by such organization or any formof governmental authority over lands or persons in Alaska; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) in any way affect any assertion that Indian country as definedin Section 1151 or title 18, United States Code, exists or does not existin Alaska.</ITAG>Section 518(g) merely clarifies that providing for Tribal participationunder the CWA, in and of itself, did not change the regulatory status ofthe Alaska Native Villages.The Agency also concludes that Tribes on former reservations in Oklahomaand elsewhere likewise are not eligible to apply for the CWA programs addressedin this notice because they also do not meet the definition of Tribes undersection 518(h)(1).<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Request for Public Comment</ITAG>EPA requests public comment and information on all aspects of this proposal.As indicated earlier in the preamble, we are particularly interested inreceiving comments on setting up the procedures for handling those criminalenforcement cases over which the Tribes do not have enforcement authority.EPA notes that very similar regulations were recently proposed for theCWA grants program. Commentors need not resubmit comments generic to allCWA Indian program regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Other Regulatory Requirements</ITAG>A. Compliance With Executive Order 12291Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193, February 9, 1981) requires that a regulatoryagency determine whether a new regulation will be ``major'' and, if so,that a Regulatory Impact Analysis be conducted. A major rule is definedas a regulation which is likely to result in:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers; individual industries;Federal, State and local government agencies; or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Since the proposed rule does not meet the definition of a major regulation,the Agency is not conducting a Regulatory Impact Analysis. The proposedrule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for reviewas required by Executive Order 12291. Any written comments from OMB toEPA and any response to these comments will be available for public inspectionfrom the person listed at the beginning of this notice.B. Paperwork Reduction ActThe information collection requirements in this proposed rule have beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the PaperworkReduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> An Information Collection Request document has been preparedby EPA (ICR No. 1542) and a copy may be obtained from Harold Woodley, InformationPolicy Branch; EPA; 401 M St., SW (PM-223); Washington, DC 20460 or bycalling 202-382-2738.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 100 hours per response including time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspects of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden,to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule willrespond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirementscontained in this proposal.C. Regulatory Flexibility ActUnder the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq., EPAmust prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all proposed regulationsthat have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.The RFA recognizes three kinds of small entities and defines them as follows:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Small governmental jurisdictions_any government of a district witha population of less than 50,000.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Small business_any business which is independently owned and operatedand not dominant in its field as defined by Small Business Administrationregulations under section 3 of the Small Business Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Small organization_any not-for-profit enterprise that is independentlyowned and operated and not dominant in its field (e.g., private hospitalsand educational institutions.)</ITAG>Using the above definition of small entity, EPA has concluded that theproposed regulation, if promulgated, will not have a significant impacton a substantial number of small entities, and that a Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis is unnecessary. EPA has reached this conclusion based on the followingconsiderations.The proposed regulation will not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small governmental organizations. Approximately 275 Indian Tribesare potentially eligible for treatment as a State under the wetlands program.While most Indian Tribes meet the definition of small governmental organizationprovided above, EPA believes the number of tribes subject to significantimpacts as a result of this proposed regulation will be a very small fractionof the total that apply. EPA considers the information required by thisrule to be the minimum necessary to effectively treat Indian tribes asStates for the purpose of the 404 permit program.The proposed regulation will not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small businesses. Although it is conceivable that an Indian tribecould impose additional requirements upon a permit applicant than the Corps,EPA believes that these situations will be rare. Any additional economicimpact on the public resulting from implementation of this proposed regulationis expected to be negligible, since tribal regulation of these activitiesis limited to areas within tribal jurisdiction.The proposed regulation will not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small organizations for the same reasons that the proposed regulationwill not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses.Accordingly, I certify that this proposed regulation, if promulgated, wouldnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Parts 230 and 233</ITAG>Indian lands, Intergovernmental relations, Navigation, Penalties, Waterpollution control, Water supply, Waterways, Wetlands.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 15, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">F.

The discharges previouslyauthorized by general permit will be regulated by State individual permits.However, in many cases, States other than Indian Tribes will lack authorityto regulate activities on Indian lands. This lack of authority does notimpair that State's ability to obtain full program approval in accordancewith this part, i.e., inability of a State which is not an Indian Tribeto regulate activities on Indian lands does not constitute a partial program.The Secretary of the Army acting through the Corps of Engineers will continueto administer the program on Indian lands if a State which is not an IndianTribe does not seek and have authority to regulate activities on Indianlands.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>2.
