Just look at the states whose banks at mid year had the highest share of nonperforming assets.    The top seven states in this dubious banking category are all major players in oil, natural gas and mining. All are west of the Mississippi. And in each of the seven states, the share of nonperforming bank assets, as reported by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., increased in the 12 months ended in June, reflecting a deteriorating picture for the banks.    Nonperforming assets are bank loans that aren't being paid off according to their original terms, plus foreclosed real estate held by the bank.    Energy loans aren't the culprits they would seem to be, however. The sorry condition of bank assets in these states rests largely with real-estate developers and other non-energy businesses who borrowed heavily when oil prices were high and then found it tough to repay when prices collapsed, starting in late 1985.    &quot;Energy problems lead to real-estate problems,&quot; says A. David Meadows, associate director of the FDIC's division of bank supervision.    It also leads to bank failures. So far this year, 159 banks have gone belly up; roughly half were in Texas and Oklahoma. An FDIC official says a &quot;good proportion&quot; of the 1,580 banks currently on the agency's &quot;problem list&quot; are also in the Energy Belt.    The accompanying table lists nonperforming bank assets as a percentage of total loans and leases, plus real estate acquired through foreclosure.    Alaska heads the list because of &quot;plain old greed by bankers and moneylenders,&quot; says Ed Rasmuson, chairman of the National Bank of Alaska. Nearly 20% of Alaska's commercial bank loans and leases, totaling $586.5 million, were nonperforming as of June 30, according to FDIC figures.    Mr. Rasmuson says speculative bank lending for construction of condominiums, housing subdivisions and commercial buildings is behind most of the bum credits. &quot;Banks have tended to overfinance and overdevelop the whole state, thinking there was a never-ending boom.&quot; He says Alaska &quot;needs more population to sustain these building sprees.&quot;    But Nancy McCallin, research economist at the Denver-based United Banks of Colorado, says bad loans aren't all bad news. &quot;They're a lagging indicator, a sign of what has happened in the past.&quot; A high rate of nonperforming loans is consistent with Colorado's present economic climate, which Ms. McCallin describes as &quot;just eking along.&quot;    Ross Waldrop, an analyst in the FDIC's research and strategic planning division, says it typically takes a year to 18 months after the trough of a business cycle before commercial and real-estate loan charge-offs peak. Charged-off loans in the energy states are still going up, he says, but the rate of increase has slowed.    New York and California made the bad-loan list because they are home to most of the nation's largest banks, many of which placed billions of dollars of loans to Brazil and Ecuador in non accrual status in early 1987. It is a measure of the improving farm economy that Iowa is the only Farm Belt state on the list and also the only one of the 10 states whose nonperforming-asset picture improved over the 12 months.    --AFTER YEARS of statistical tinkering, the federal government is close to producing the first uniform series of gross state product numbers for the 50 states.    GSP is a scaled-down version of gross national product, measuring the total value of goods and services produced by a state in a given period. The figure is the most comprehensive measure of a state's economic activity.    A couple dozen states already produce their own gross product numbers, but the arithmetic and data vary from state to state. Provisional GSP numbers expected from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis in early 1988 will be statistically consistent, allowing Illinois, for instance, to compare its growth rate with that of California or Connecticut.    The GSP figures will be available, for a price, to outsiders. The bureau says it's waiting to hear from prospective customers before deciding how much, or how little, of the huge volume of GSP data to package on floppy disks for private users.    --WHERE THE JAPANESE ARE: Cincinnati's chamber of commerce publishes a directory of 100 Japanese manufacturers doing business in &quot;auto alley&quot; -- the six Midwestern states (Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee) where Japanese auto-assembly plants are located.    ---                            NONPERFORMING BANK ASSETS                            ------------------------- STATE                      6/30/87           6/30/86 Alaska                      19.5%              7.4% Wyoming                     10.6               8.4 Oklahoma                     9.8               7.5 Texas                        8.4               5.0 Louisiana                    7.7               5.8 Colorado                     6.3               5.4 Montana                      6.0               5.9 New York                     5.7               3.1 California                   5.1               4.0 Iowa                         4.6               5.9   Source: Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
