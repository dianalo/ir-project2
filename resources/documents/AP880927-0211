(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new NASA launch directorate metTuesday to clear the shuttle Discovery for its Thursday liftoff,hearing an ``excellent review'' of the $1.5 billion spacecraft'sreadiness _ but holding off giving a go-ahead for the finalcountdown.   ``In general, the whole picture is very good for going flyingthe day after tomorrow,'' said former astronaut Robert Crippen, whoheads the launch oversight panel created to overcome managementproblems that contributed to the 1986 Challenger disaster.   Crippen said the group was focusing on two items and needed tobe certain neither would imperil NASA's first manned mission in 32months.   Launch is scheduled for 9:59 a.m. EDT on Thursday, with thefinal countdown to begin early Wednesday evening. ``The weather isprobably the biggest question mark,'' said Crippen.   Cloud-covered skies and Atlantic winds loomed, as always, as apossible threat. Air Force spokesman Mike Beeman forecast ``a 20percent probability of bad weather at launch time,'' but added,``That's pretty low.'' Historically, launches have been delayed 40percent of the time because of weather.   The outlook didn't brighten much late in the day. Weathermenstill were predicting widely scattered showers in the area.   Discovery's five astronauts went over their flight plan andrelaxed with their wives as the ship sat surrounded by workplatforms on launch pad 39B. Heat shields, removed for enginecheck-out, were back in place and engineers checked guidance andnavigation systems. Inside the cargo bay: the Tracking and DataRelay Satellite (TDRS) to be placed in orbit just six hours afterlaunch. A similar satellite was destroyed in the Challengercatastrophe.   One of the hardware items still in question was an O-ring in thesatellite propulsion system. The other involved a small jetthruster aboard the orbiter itself _ a component that could bebypassed if need be.   The $100 million data-relay satellite had already been approvedfor flight when NASA discovered a problem with similar hardwarebeing prepared for flight next February.   Crippen said an examination of the inertial upper stage (IUS)rocket that boosts the satellite to its final orbit indicateddamage in the O-ring that seals the pressure needed to gain thrustfor orbit. (The O-ring is not the same part that failed in leadingto the 1986 Challenger disaster.)   NASA needed to be certain the flaw was not replicated aboardDiscovery, Crippen said. Air Force Col. Dennis E. Beebe saidexperts believed the O-ring was ``damaged as part of theinstallation procedures,'' and so the problem would not also existon the satellite aboard Discovery.   Crippen said the shuttle cargo bay would not be opened forinspection of the satellite, but that propulsion experts wouldconduct tests overnight on other such rockets to make sure theydon't leak.   ``You have heard they have a great deal of confidence they'll beable to come in and tell us tomorrow that they think they areprepared to fly,'' Crippen said.   The report was due at another meeting of the oversight team at10 a.m.   Delivery of the satellite is Discovery's main mission in NASA'slong-awaited return to space, and the space agency would not likelylaunch without being sure there was no problem.   The shuttle fleet has been grounded since Jan. 28, 1986, when abooster rocket failure destroyed Challenger and took the lives ofseven astronauts. Many NASA workers were wearing green ribbons ontheir workclothes this week to signify their hopes for a safeliftoff and successful mission.   A ``lightning alert'' delayed the final preparation ofDiscovery's power-producing fuel cells Tuesday morning, but thecountdown was not affected. The countdown was to enter a 19-hourhold at midnight, a cushion that gives NASA time for testing thesatellite O-ring.   Commander Frederick H. Hauck and pilot Richard O. Covey were upat dawn Tuesday, practicing landings on the Kennedy Space Centerrunway in an aircraft that handles like a shuttle. The three-milerunway would be used if a launching problem forced the shuttle toreturn home.   At the Launch Control Center, engineers were checking electronicreadings from the ship, 4.2 miles distant. At 1:40 a.m. EDTThursday, a half-million gallons of super-cold fuel will pour intothe shuttle's tanks, aiming for the nationally televised liftoff.   The 21-person launch oversight team consists of top officialsfrom each of 17 units responsible for shuttle procedures orcomponents. In their first meeting ever, they gathered Tuesday toair any problems that might surface. The Rogers Commission, whichinvestigated the Challenger accident, found that engineers'opposition to launching in cold weather never reached the ears ofkey NASA launch officials.   Crippen, one of several former astronauts who have moved intokey shuttle management posts since the accident, heads the unit andhas sole authority to stop a launch. The launch directorate is oncall all through the final 48 hours.   Hauck, Covey and mission specialists George D. Nelson, David C.Hilmers and John M. Lounge reviewed countdown and flight proceduresand underwent physical examinations. They also received a weatherbriefing.   NASA's rules, tightened since Challenger, forbid launching whenthere is lightning or rain within 10 miles of the pad. Winds ofmore than 17 knots (about 20 mph) from the south or 24 knots (28mph) from any direction would automatically scrub the liftoff.</TEXT></DOC>
