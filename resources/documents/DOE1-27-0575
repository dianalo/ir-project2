The closure optionsconsidered for the Reactor Seepage Basins are waste removal and closure,no waste removal and closure, and no action. The predominant pathwaysfor human exposure to chemical and/or radioactive constituents are throughsurface, subsurface, and atmospheric transport. Modeling calculationswere made to determine the risks to human population via these generalpathways for the three postulated closure options. An ecological assessmentwas conducted to predict the environmental impacts on aquatic and terrestrialbiota. The relative costs for each of the closure options was estimated.35 refs., 24 figs., 64 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
