Camden, N.J.-based Campbell declined to disclose the sales price, but said Pietro's had 1986 sales of about $30 million.    Pietro's, a Campbell unit since 1973, operates 65 pizza restaurants throughout Oregon and Washington state. It employs about 2,000 people.    The food-products concern also said it hopes &quot;soon&quot; to sell Annabelle's restaurant chain, which operates in the Southeast.    &quot;We want to stick to what we do best,&quot; a company spokesman said. &quot;Restaurants no longer fit into our strategy.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
