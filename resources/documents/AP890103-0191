The movement is marked by a hyperbolic rhetoric reminiscent ofthe '60s. Some activists call themselves freedom fighters foranimals. Newkirk is happy to reiterate a statement some others wishshe had never said in the first place.   ``I can't even remember it exactly,'' says British-born Newkirk,``but I stand by it l00 percent. What I said was a pig is a boy is adog is a rat in that they are all sentient beings, they are allcapable of suffering. That is indisputable.''   The various groups are not above squabbling, especially overfunding.   Cave says the Humane Society of the United States, which has anannual budget of $9 million, ``has a stranglehold on the funds thatis totally unethical. Its president, John Hoyt, is paid $139,000 ayear. The Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty toAnimals has a fortune sitting idle in investments. They could wipeout the pet overpopulation in one year if they would use some ofthat money.''   The MSPCA, founded in 1839, has an endowment of $42 million andspent $15 million last year supporting three veterinarian hospitals,nine shelters and various educational projects.   The Humane Society doesn't support some of the statements of theradicals, and deplores the violence.   ``We like to be taken seriously when we go to the Hill,'' says aHumane Society spokeswoman. ``We don't like to be seen as frothingat the mouth.''   Cave, who lives on a $10,000 salary, part of his group's totalbudget of $350,000, led the Cornell campaign. He calls it a landmarkin that the challenge was not about sloppy laboratory conditions,but the very nature of the research.   He maintained that barbituate addiction is a complex humanproblem and that it was inappropriate to expose cats _ or any animal_ to the horrors of withdrawal, a self-inflicted condition in humans.   Cave is now attacking a glue-sniffing experiment using monkeys atNew York University Hospital. In nice weather, Trans-Species has 14tables out every weekend on New York City streets explaining itsphilosophy.   The biomedical research community has reacted by forming aWashington-based educational and lobbying group.   ``We're not talking here about little old ladies in blue hair,''says Frankie Trull, president of the Foundation for BiomedicalResearch. ``We have heard of over 50 death threats. The researchcommunity is so unprepared for the animal rights movement. First ofall, they have jobs and they don't have time to hang out at shoppingcenters with signs.   ``It is costing millions in increased security, replacing animalsthat were stolen and buildings that were torched. It is no laughingmatter.''   The research scientist at Cornell, Dr. Michiko Okamoto, refusesto talk to reporters. Her colleagues say she was shocked by thedevelopments.   Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, a cardiovascular surgeon who became ahousehold name, has emerged as one spokesman for the researchers.Now 80, but working daily from 4 a.m. till midnight, DeBakey says heoccasionally gets death threats. He sees the animal rights movementas one with great emotional appeal, but one that is not telling thewhole story.   ``These people are intimidating a lot of people,'' DeBakey says.``If you want to become a Jehovah's Witness and refuse blood fromanother person, I have no argument. I don't agree with it, but Irespect your right to do it. What I object to here is the attempt toenforce this view on others.   ``I have yet to see a patient who refused treatment from researchgained from animals. Do these people plan on turning down suchtreatment if they need it?''   DeBakey says his surgical breakthroughs, which saved thousands oflives, resulted from experimentation on dogs.   ``Almost everything in the cardiovascular field was developedthrough animal research. You can't use cells or cell cultures orcomputers.''   The surgeon says animal activists ``are not improving theconditions of animals used in research, They are pricing it out ofthe market. Twelve states have now passed laws prohibiting the useof pound animals. Yet the taxpayer spends $600 million a year caringfor pound animals and putting them to sleep.   ``The activists have great political strength and slickorganizations. They say alternative methods can be used. They arewrong.''   DeBakey worries about the Cornell decision.   ``It is disturbing to see an institution of higher learning cavein,'' DeBakey says. ``The integrity of that academic institution iseroded.''   Medical scientists point to the great strides made using animalmodels. Everything from polio vaccine to treatments for suchdiseases as diabetes, cancer, and heart disease have benefited fromresearch on animals.   The activists insist the same advances could have been made usingdifferent kinds of research.   Dr. Frederick King, director of the Yerkes Primate Center atEmory University in Atlanta, also a target of death threats, iseager to speak out. Researchers at his institution are injectingchimpanzees with the deadly AIDS virus (So far it has not jumpedtheir immune barrier, but King says that does not mean it will notwith a longer incubation).   The animals rights militants say that is not necessary sincethere are thousands of dying human victims who would gladly allowthemselves to be experimented upon.   ``Forget the ethical questions,'' Newkirk says. ``It's badscience. They are retarding the AIDS research by using animals.''   King dismisses that argument. He says it's yet another case ofnon-scientists throwing in their non-scientific opinion.   ``My question is where have all the moderates gone?'' King says.``Even Jane Goodall, who came here about a year ago, has turned totheir side. She's a one-agenda person, fanatically attached tochimps.   ``The moderates all seem to have gone into the woodwork.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Jan. 15</NOTE></DOC>
