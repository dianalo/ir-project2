A family of six and three other people were missing and feareddead under the rubble in Mieh Mieh, a refugee camp outside Sidonthat suffered the greatest damage. Police said 41 people werewounded, all but one at Mieh Mieh.   In south Lebanon, Israeli soldiers and allied militiamen pouredartillery fire on positions of Lebanese guerrillas in and aroundMashgara, police reported. They said it might be a prelude to aground thrust.   Jets struck targets outside the southern port and the capital 4{hours apart in the third and fourth raids since a suicide ShiiteMoslem car bomber killed eight Israeli soldiers a week ago in theborder ``security zone'' Israel maintains in south Lebanon.   At least 27 people have been killed and 16 wounded in the fourraids, which bring the total Israel air strikes in Lebanon this yearto 19. Police say at least 95 have been killed and 184 wounded inall the raids.   In Jerusalem, an Israeli military spokesman later said the planesblasted suspected guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon three timesWednesday _ although Lebanese police reported two raids _ with allaircraft home safe after scoring accurate hits. Under militaryregulations, the spokesman was not identified.   He said the planes bombed sites around Damour and Beirut afterraiding targets near Sidon.   ``The raid near Sidon is one of the heaviest, if not theheaviest, in Lebanon this year,'' said a police spokesman, whosename cannot be used because of regulations. He said it caused ``themost severe destruction in Mieh Mieh since the 1982 Israeliinvasion.''   Among those killed in the refugee camp was Col. Mustafa Daoud,40, commander of the Fatah Militia, a guerrilla group of about 1,000fighters from the mainstream Fatah faction led by PLO chief YasserArafat, police said.   Most of the wounded were guerrillas and included Col. MohsenHallak, commander of the 1,000-man Beit al-Maqdes (Jerusalem)battalion, another Palestine Liberation Organization unit, thepolice spokesman reported. He said some others were officers ofForce 17, the PLO security service.   Police said the second Israeli raid struck bases of pro-SyrianPalestinian factions in the hills of Khalde and Aramoun on Beirut'ssouthern fringe. They described the main target as a base behind ahilltop monastery overlooking the towns of Damour and Naameh, midwayalong the coastal highway between Beirut and Sidon. The port city isabout 25 miles south of Beirut.   The raiding jets struck twice within 15 minutes, firing 10air-to-surface rockets, four of which failed to explode, the reportsaid. Journalists were not allowed to approach the base, whichconsists of half a dozen tents belonging to the Democratic Front forthe Liberation of Palestine.   Syrian anti-aircraft batteries near Beirut airport and Aramounfired at attackers but police said they claimed no hits.   Police in the south said four fighter-bombers streaked in fromthe Mediterranean at 11 a.m. and fired 12 rockets into Mieh Mieh andnearby Ein el-Dilb hill in three passes spread over eight minutes.   ``At least 30 buildings within a radius of 150 meters in MiehMieh's central square were pulverized,'' the police spokesman said.``Many victims, including a family of six living in an abandonedUNRWA school are still buried in he rubble.''   The U.N. Relief and Works Agency aids Palestinian refugees.   Abu Yasser, PLO military commander for the Sidon region, said:``It's a massacre. Plenty of people are buried in the debris.''   A guerrilla who gave his name as Abu Khaled said: ``It was soswift that we couldn't look up at the sky to fire back at theplanes.''   Israel said the raids followed two unsuccessful attempts byPalestinian guerrillas Tuesday to infiltrate into Israel fromLebanon.   Israel television said Israeli-backed militiamen from theChristian village of Jezzine in southern Lebanon destroyed aguerrilla outpost near Libah, east of Sidon. It said the mainlyChristian force killed one Moslem militiaman, captured three andsuffered two casualties, not specified.   The outpost was on a hill overlooking Jezzine and subjected thetown to constant artillery bombardments.   Bassam Abu Sharif, chief spokesman for Arafat, claimed inBaghdad, Iraq, that Israeli troops were massing for an attack onPalestinian and Lebanese forces at Sidon.</TEXT></DOC>
