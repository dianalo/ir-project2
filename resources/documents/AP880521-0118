(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The death of three mountain climbers in anavalanche on Mount Rainier will probably attract even morethrillseekers to a peak that looks lovely but sometimes acts like a``devil that shows pity on noone,'' National Park officials say.   ``News like this tends to bring more people to the mountain,''said Bill Jensen, the park's chief ranger. ``It's a very dangerous,hazardous route and that's what attracts people _ the thrill ofdanger.''   The bodies of Craig Loyal Adkison, 37, of Kirkland; DavidKellokoski, 30, of Tahoe-Paradise, Calif., and Greg Remmick, 32, ofCitrus Heights, Calif., were recovered by helicopter Friday fromthe 14,410-foot mountain.   They had been scheduled to finish their climb of the treacherousLiberty Ridge route up the mountain's north face on May 14. Thesearch began for the three Tuesday, and their bodies were spottedfrom the air Thursday.   The deaths brought to 54 the number of climbers who have died onthe dormant volcano since 1898, and another 24 have perished onlesser peaks and slopes nearby, said Cy Hentges, a spokesman forMount Rainier National Park.   Officials at Mount Rainier National Park stressed the mountain'sperilous, unpredictable nature and worried that the latest deathswould attract thrill-seeking climbers to it.   ``Let's realize that the American Everest team trained on it,''Hentges said. ``That should tell you something. It's on a miniaturescale, but it provides anything and everything that Everest does,except it's not that high.   ``You can walk up sometimes, roped, with proper equipment but inshorts, but all it takes is one storm to come in _ and this hashappened many times _ to kill people within half an hour of a roadsystem. It has killed children on what seems like a gentle slope.It's something that can become very angry.   ``It looks so lovely and so beautiful, and yet it can be a devilthat shows pity on no one.''   Hentges said bad weather and unstable fresh snow probably causedthe three to fall 2,000 feet to their deaths in an avalanche. Theirbodies were recovered from an avalanche chute at the 10,000-footlevel by a helicopter equipped with a grappling hook that snaggedthe rope connecting them and carried them to a safer spot.   About 8,000 people attempt Mount Rainier each year, most of themup the less steep and glaciated south side, and about half make it.   To brave the Liberty Ridge route, climbers must be very strongand well-prepared for bad weather, Hentges said.   Everest veteran Lou Whittaker, who has run the only guideservice on the peak for decades and that on the southerly route,made six attempts on Liberty Ridge before making it to the summit,Hentges said.   ``If weather's coming in, you have to say it's not safe and turnaround,'' he said.   ``There is a point of no return,'' Hentges added, ``when youmust continue to the top, and if you hit bad weather, you can getin real trouble.''</TEXT></DOC>
