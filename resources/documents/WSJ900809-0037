Ward McCarthy Jr., amanaging director at Stone andamp; McCarthy Research Associates.&quot;This auction was an absolute disaster. The bidding wassloppy, and it looks like a lot of people tried to miss theauction.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The disappointment in yesterday's auction spilled overonto the broader bond market, causing prices to gyratewildly. The market recovered later in the day with thebenchmark 30-year Treasury bond posting gains of about 3/8point, or $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.   The Treasury had difficulty selling $10.5 billion often-year notes yesterday in the second portion of thegovernment's three-part $32.25 billion quarterly refunding ofthe federal debt. The ten-year note sale followed a weakthree-year note auction on Tuesday.   Analysts said investors and dealers avoided the auctiondue to fears that spiraling oil prices and Mideast turmoilwill lead to rising inflation -- the bane of the bond market.The poor auction results also reflect the lack of buying byJapanese and other foreign investors.   &quot;When I called some of my clients overseas, they seemed tosuggest that U.S. rates are not that attractive and not worththe currency risk,&quot; said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, president ofMaria Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc.   Foreign institutional investors -- especially from Japanand the Middle East -- have been big buyers of U.S. Treasurysecurities at previous auctions. But in recent months, yieldson government bonds in Japan have risen sharply and are nownearly as high as U.S. yields. As a result, Japaneseinvestors are keeping their cash at home. Investors from theMiddle East, preoccupied with more important matters, didn'tshow up in a big way either.   At yesterday's Treasury auction, the average yield on the10-year notes was 8.77%. But because there wasn't enoughdemand at the average yield, the Treasury was forced toaccept bids as high as 8.84% to complete the auction.   The uncommonly wide spread between the average and highyield, called a &quot;tail,&quot; is an indication that bond dealerswere reluctant to bid for the securities. The tail atyesterday's auction was the longest since May 1980, accordingto Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.   &quot;Dealers did not bid aggressively because they did not seeany interest from their client base,&quot; said Lawrence Leuzzi, atrading manager at S.G. Warburg andamp; Co. (Only a small group ofbrokerage firms and commercial banks are allowed to bid atTreasury auctions. These firms then resell the securities tocustomers. Individuals, however, can purchase securitiesdirectly from the Treasury through &quot;noncompetitive&quot; tenders.)   Another indication that the Treasury had difficultyselling its securities was the &quot;bid-to-cover&quot; ratio, whichmeasures the number of bids the Treasury receives for eachone it accepts. At yesterday's sale, bid-to-cover ratio was1.59, the lowest since 1978, according to Dean Witter. Thebid-to-cover ratio averaged 2.37 at the 12 previous 10-yearnote auctions and was 3.0 at the previous 10-year note salein May.   William Brachfeld, manager of trading at the New Yorkoffice of Japan's Daiwa Securities Inc., estimates that the&quot;Big Four&quot; Japanese securities firms bought 15% of theten-year notes, down from 25% to 30% at recent 10-yearauctions. And much of yesterday's purchases went intospeculative trading accounts, not long-term investmentaccounts.   Shortly after the auction ended, dealers who bought thebonds were forced to cut prices in an attempt to attractbuyers. As prices slid, traders said that demand suddenlymaterialized.   &quot;Some investors were afraid to buy at the auction, butwhen the average yield reached 8.80%, investors found that tobe very attractive,&quot; said Thomas Murphy, a managing directorat Salomon Brother Inc.   Noncompetitive bids at yesterday's auction, the bestindication of demand from individual investors and smallinstitutions, totaled $560 million compared with $659 millionat the previous 10-year note auction in May.   The auction results sent shock waves through the bondmarket and caused prices to abruptly reverse directions. Bondprices were 1/4 point higher before the auction results wereannounced, then fell 1/4 point when the government releasedthe auction statistics at 2:30 p.m. EDT. The market improvedlater in the day and prices ended mixed.   The Treasury's quarterly auction continues today with thesale of $10.25 billion of 30-year bonds.   Economists and dealers are not optimistic about theprospects of today's auction. &quot;If {investors and dealers} arerunning away from the 10-year notes like this, one can onlywonder what's going to happen when it comes time to buy the{30-year} bond,&quot; said Robert Brusca, chief economist at NikkoSecurities.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasury prices ended mixed yesterday, with short-termnotes posting modest losses while long-term bonds postedgains.   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price ofabout 99 3/32 to yield 8.82% compared with 98 23/32 onTuesday to yield 8.86%. The new three-year notes, which wereauctioned Tuesday, ended yesterday at a price of 99 17/32,down from 101 3/32 on Tuesday. The issue's yield rose to8.16% from 8.14%.   Prices of the old ten-year notes ended at 100 27/32, upfrom 100 21/32 on Tuesday. The yield fell to 8.72% from8.75%.   Here are details of yesterday's auction:                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it.                                                                                                                              10-Year Notes                                                                                                          Applications                              $16,737,124,000   Accepted bids                             $10,502,824,000   Accepted at low price                                 66%   Accepted noncompetitively                    $560,000,000   Average price (Rate)                       99.869 (8.77%)   High price (Rate)                         100.066 (8.74%)   Low price (Rate)                            99.411(8.84%)   Interest rate                                      8 3/4%                                                                                                          The notes are dated Aug. 15 and mature Aug. 15, 2000.                                                                                                          Corporate, Junk Bonds                                                                                                          The junk-bond market disregarded stock market gains andended weaker yesterday.   Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed almost 25points higher at 2734.90, most junk-bond prices finishedbetween 1/4 and 3/8 points lower. Junk bonds are high-yieldhigh-risk corporate securities that have low credit ratingsor no credit ratings at all.   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, high-gradecorporate bonds closed unchanged to slightly higher.                                                                                                          Foreign Bonds                                                                                                          Japanese government bonds ended sharply higher asshort-covering in the final hour of trading developed into amad scramble to buy Japanese government bonds and futurescontracts.   The rally was triggered by news that Saudi Arabia plans toincrease production of oil. Fears that oil shortages wouldlead to higher prices and spiraling inflation has shaken bondmarkets around the world, but the Japanese market was hurtthe hardest.   The hectic short-covering drove down the yield on Japan'sbenchmark 10-year bond below 8%. The jump in prices quicklypushed developments in the Persian Gulf into the backgroundas traders feared the market would get away from them.   &quot;Traders didn't have time to think about the situation inthe Middle East,&quot; said one dealer at a major Japanesecommercial bank. For traders taking positions day-to-day thelate surge in prices &quot;was very fearful,&quot; he said.   The benchmark No. 119 10-year bond ended at a price of83.97, up 0.93 point. The issue's yield fell 0.20 percentagepoint to 7.875%. (When calculated using the semiannualcompound method, the yield on the No. 119 ended at 7.29%,according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)   The heavy buying hit futures first and quickly spread tothe cash market. &quot;Then there was massive buying by securitieshouses,&quot; said one dealer, especially by the so-called BigFour Japanese securities firms. &quot;People went on a sort ofpanic buying spree&quot; as prices started to pick up in themiddle of the afternoon and &quot;shorts were afraid the marketwas moving away from them.&quot;   Dealers and professional traders, betting that prices willfall, sometimes sell borrowed securities and hope to profitby replacing what was borrowed with cheaper securities. Thatis called a short sale. Short-covering occurs when thedealers buy securities to replace what they borrowed.   Bond prices ended weaker in Europe, although trading wasgenerally light in most markets. French government bonds fellsharply as market participants remained gripped by the MiddleEast crisis. But prices were just moderately lower in WestGermany and Britain.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          Municipal bonds were generally flat to 1/4 point lower.   The market's downward bias was primarily because of swingsin Treasurys and continued inflation worries.   Among actively traded issues, the New Jersey TurnpikeAuthority's 7.20% securities of 2018 finished virtuallyunchanged at 97 3/4, with the yield falling to 7.37% from7.38% late Tuesday.   In new issue activity, $600 million of Massachusettsgeneral obligation bond anticipation notes were priced by aGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co. group.   The notes, which are due Oct. 17, 1990, are 7% issuespriced to yield 5.95%.                                                                                                          Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage securities ended unchanged to slightly lower,after once more following Treasurys in a session dominatedagain by oil prices and the crisis in the Middle East.   The market's volatility didn't stem a rush of new issuancein the real estate mortgage investment conduit andassetbacked sectors.   Three Remic issues totaling $1.3 billion and twoasset-backed deals totaling $660 million were priced thissession.   In the secondary market, Government National MortgageAssociation 9.5% issues were off 1/32 at 98 14/32, FederalHome Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% issues were off 1/32 at 98 5/32and Federal National Mortgage Association 9.5% issues werealso down 1/32, at 98 22/32.   In the market for new Remics, details were announced for a$500.25 million Fannie Mae deal through Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.that is backed by Fannie Mae 9.5% 30-year securities; a $300million Fannie Mae issue through Citicorp that uses FannieMae 9% 30-year securities and a $500 million issue ofcollateralized mortgage obligation Remics through SalomonBrothers Inc. that uses Ginnie Mae 9% 30-year securities.   As for the asset-backed sector, two of the many deals thatare expected to be priced in the near-term were pricedyesterday.
