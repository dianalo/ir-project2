Accordingly, the remand results regardingSerampore which were affirmed by the Court on February 10, 1989 are finaland in effect.<ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>In accordance with the Court's order of September 12, 1988, we are directingthe Customs Service on or after the date of publication of this noticein the <T4>Federal Register</T4> to terminate the suspension of liquidation, releaseany bond, refund any cash deposit, and proceed with the liquidation ofall entries of this merchandise produced by Serampore with regard to antidumpingduties. With respect to Kejriwal and all other manufacturers, sellers andexporters, the Customs Service shall continue to suspend liquidation ofall entries of castings from India and require a cash deposit equal tothe estimated weighted-average amount by which the foreign market valueof the merchandise subject to the redetermination exceeds the United Statesprice.The weighted-average margins are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,7.3</C> <H1>Manufacturers/sellers/exporters</H1><H1>Weighted-average margin percentage</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">RSI (de minimis) (excluded)<D>0.02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Kejriwal<D>2.93</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Serampore (de minimis) (excluded)<D>0.487</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Kajaria (de minimis) (excluded)<D>0.04</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">All others<D>2.93</D></ITAG></ITAG>Article VI.5 of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade provides that``(n)o producer * * * shall be subject to both antidumping and countervailingduties to compensate for the same situation of dumping or export subsidization.''This provision is implemented by section 772(d)(1)(D) of the Tariff Actof 1930, as amended. Since dumping duties cannot be assessed on the portionof the margin attributable to export subsidies, there is no reason to requirea cash deposit for that amount. Accordingly, the level of certain exportsubsidies (as determined in the September 23, 1988 Amendment of Final Resultsof Administrative Review of the Countervailing Duty Order on Certain Iron-MetalCastings from India (51 FR 45788)), which is 7.31 percent <T3>ad valorem,</T3> will be subtracted from the above dumping marginsfor cash deposit purposes only for imports of construction castings coveredby the countervailing duty order.<ITAG tagnum="6">Timothy N.
