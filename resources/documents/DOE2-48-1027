<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-48-1027 </DOCNO><TEXT>A two-source shear pattern recording is proposed as a method for single-shotmeasurement of the pulse shape from nearly monochromatic sources whosepulse lengths are shorter than their coherence times. The basis of thismethod relies on the assertion that if two identical electromagneticpulses are recombined with a time delay greater than the sum of theirpulse widths, the recordable spatial pattern has no fringes in it. Atan arbitrary delay, translated into an actual spatial recording position,the recorded modulated intensity will sample the corresponding laserintensity at that delay time, but with a modulation due to the coherencefunction of the electromagnetic pulse. Two arrangements are proposedfor recording the pattern. The principles, the design parameters, andthe methodologies of these arrangements are presented. Resolutions ofthe configurations and their limitations are given as well.</TEXT></DOC>
