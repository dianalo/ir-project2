By defining inner products for images and forsets of line integrals, they formulate a generalized least-squares problemand then apply standard optimization techniques to derive optimal imagereconstruction algorithms. The inner products, and their associated norms,are defined for infinite-dimensional functions and linear operators,thereby avoiding problems associated with discrete finite-dimensionalrepresentations. From the inner product framework, the authors derivenew image reconstruction algorithms, and unify several known algorithmsby showing them to be optimal under different inner products. Under onespecial inner product the authors prove that the line integral transformis a norm preserving linear operator. This result enables them to provethat the well known convolution-backprojection algorithm, which has neverbefore been understood to be optimal in any sense, is in fact an optimalleast-squares algorithm under the rho norm.</TEXT></DOC>
