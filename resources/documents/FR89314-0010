Refuge fishing programs are reviewedannually to determine whether the regulations governing fishing on individualrefuges should be modified. Changing environmental conditions, State andFederal regulations and other factors affecting fish populations and habitatsmay warrant such amendments. The modifications made ensure the continuedcompatibility of fishing with the purposes for which the individual refugesinvolved were established, and to the extent practical, make refuge fishingprograms consistent with State regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>April 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Larry LaRochelle, Division ofRefuges, Fish and Wildlife Service, 18th and C Streets NW., Washington,DC 20240; Telephone 202-343-4313.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>50 CFR Part 33 contians the provisionsthat govern fishing on NWRs. Fishing is regulated on refuges to (1) ensurecompatibility with refuge purposes, (2) properly manage the fishery resourceand (3) protect other refuge values. On many refuges, the Service policyof adopting State fishing regulations is an adequate way of meeting theseobjectives. On other refuges it is necessary to supplement State regulationswith refuge-specific fishing regulations which will ensure that the Servicemeets its management responsibilities, as outlined under the section entitled``Conformance with Statutory and Regulatory Authorities'' in the proposedrule of November 1, 1988, at 53 FR 44043. Refuge-specific fishing regulationsare issued only after the final publication of the opening of a wildliferefuge to fishing. These regulations may list the seasons, methods of takingfish, descriptions of open areas and other provisions. The Service haspreviously issued refuge-specific fishing regulations in 50 CFR Part 33.This rule amends and supplements certain refuge-specific regulations in50 CFR Part 33, andSection;andSection; 33.8 through 33.51, which pertain tofishing on individual refuges in their respective alphabetically listedState.The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practicable,to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process.On November 1, 1988, at 53 FR 44043, the Service published a proposed rulemakingto amend certain regulations in 50 CFR Part 33 and invited the public tocomment. No comments were received. Therefore, the proposed refuge-specificfishing regulations are here published, with minor technical corrections,as a final rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Effect</ITAG>Executive Order 12291 requires the preparation of regulatory impact analysesfor major rules. A major rule is one likely to result in an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more, a major increase in cost or pricesfor consumers, individual industries, government agencies or geographicregions, or significant adverse effects on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises. The Regulatory FlexibilityAct of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) further requires the preparation of flexibility analysesfor rules that will have a significant effect on a substantial number ofsmall entities, which include small businesses, organizations or governmentaljurisdictions.These amendments to the codified refuge-specific fishing regulations makerelatively minor adjustments to existing fishing programs. The regulationsare not expected to have any gross economic effect and will not cause anincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,State or local governments, agencies or geographic regions. The benefitsaccruing to the public are expected to exceed the costs of administeringthis rule. Accordingly, the Department has determined that this rule isnot a ``major rule'' within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 and willnot have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of smallentities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The Service has received approval from the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) for the information collection requirements of these regulationspursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). These requirements are presently approved by OMB underandplusmin;1018-0014 Economic and Public Use Permits. Public reporting burdenfor these forms is estimated to average .1038 hours or 6.2 minutes perresponse for a total burden for all forms used of 15,146 hours, includingtime for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and completingand reviewing the form. Direct comments on the burden estimate or any otheraspect of these forms to Information Collection Office, U.S. Fish and WildlifeService, Washington, DC 20240; and the Office of Information and RegulatoryAffairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Considerations</ITAG>Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543)is ensured when fishing plans are developed and the determinations requiredby these Acts are made prior to the addition of refuges to the list ofareas open to sport fishing in 50 CFR Part 33. Refuge-specific fishingregulations are subject to a categorical exclusion from the NEPA processif they do not significantly alter the existing use of a particular refuge.The changes made in this rulemaking will not significantly alter the existinguses of the refuges involved.Information regarding the conditions that apply to individual refuge fishingprograms, any restrictions related to public use on the refuge and a mapof the refuge are available at refuge headquarters.
