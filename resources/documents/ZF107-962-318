 Tel: (0252) 522500 * DESCRIPTION 400dpilaser page printer.andP;  * PRICE 4,295 pounds sterlingandM;* PC USER VERDICT  Genicom offers a complete range of output options coveringLaserjet, PostScript compatibility, and the ACE emulation, all in one 400dpimachine.andP;  The Genicom 6142 is likely to be a reliable printer solution forthe foreseeable future.andM;Office printers have become a lot more complex over the years, as has thesoftware that drives them.andP;  So too has the choice of a suitable printer.andO;Should you go for PostScript?andP;  Will 1Mb of printer memory be sufficient?andP;  Doyou want to use the printer for final output, or as a proofing machine?andM;Page printers, using LED or laser engines, can produce very impressiveoutput.andP;  For many purposes, the 300 dots per inch (dpi) resolution of mostpage printers is close enough to that of typeset copy; however, it can neverequal typeset quality.andP;  Increasingly, the PostScript page descriptionlanguage is used to create standard files which can be 'proofed' on a pageprinter and then transmitted to a typesetter for output on a high-resolutiondevice.andM;If you're using a PostScript printer for proofing, about all you want isspeed and compatibility, that is, you want to know that the page you printwill look exactly like the final page, only not at as high a resolution.andP;  Asmall snag with PostScript-equipped 300dpi engines, is that they tend toproduce slightly jagged edges on thin curved diagonal lines.andM;If you use a laser for final output, however, you may be attracted byprinters based on Canon's SX 400dpi engine.andP;  The snag is that an A4 pageprinted on a 400dpi printer occupies a bitmap twice as big as a 300dpiprinter's.andP;  So using a page printer at higher resolution is going to demandeven more memory, and that costs money.andP;  The arrival of A3 printers will putfurther demands on memory.andM;We looked at two printers for this comparison; one is an Adobe PostScript LEDprinter from NEC, the LC890 SilentWriter.andP;  LED printers use fewer mechanicalparts than laser printers, thereby offering greater reliability.andM;The other printer we looked at was the Genicom 6142.andP;  This is based on theCanon 400dpi SX engine, and includes a PostScript-compatible interpreter.andO;The move to 400dpi has the effect of smoothing out most of theinconsistencies that show up at 300dpi.andM;NEC LC890 SilentWriterandM;NEC's LC890 page printer incorporates Adobe's PostScript interpreter, version47.0, and the same 35 fonts that grace the Apple LaserWriter Plus.andP;  It has3Mv of memory, enough for really complex pages of mixed text and graphics.andM;The only expansion possible, because everything else is built-in, is theaddition of a 25-sheet face-up output tray, but that really is all you'llneed other than paper, toner every 3,000 pages, and a replacement PCcartridge every 7,000 pages.andP;  As it's a PostScript printer licensed by Adobe,you may purchase any of Adobe's hundreds of additional fonts and downloadthem to the printer.andM;The LC890 is a big printer -- by no means can it be called compact.andP;  Theimpression of size is reinforced by the twin paper hoppers mounted on the topcover.andP;  The LC890 has two hoppers, each capable of holding 250 sheets ofpaper, which, used in unison, can produce collated output in the face-downtray built in to the top cover.andM;You can have face-up output by opening a cover in the front of the printerwhich lets finished pages pop out onto your desk.andP;  The optional face-up trayattaches to this front exit.andM;The printer controls are grouped on the front panel next to a backlit LCDwhich either shows the current status of the printer, or presents menuchoices when in setup mode.andP;  The display is easy to read from close up, butless so from a distance.andP;  This matters because you actually have to be aquite close to see the message, 'processing', that's displayed when a page isbeing prepared.andP;  As complex pages can take several minutes to be prepared forprinting, some more obvious sign of activity would be helpful.andM;The other use of the panel is to set up the printer.andP;  This is very easy,because the buttons with which you step through the menu changing settingsare clearly marked as 'menu', 'select', and 'next'.andP;  The setup configurationmenu allows you to specify the communications parameters, (serial RS232 orRS422, parallel, or AppleTalk, up to 57,600 baud), the emulation, defaultfont and point size, and whether to print a start page listing the currentconfiguration.andM;The NEC LC890 has its standard PostScript batch mode, an interactivePostScpript mode, and two standard business printer emulations, the HPLaserjet II and the Diablo 630.andP;  The last two only have access to 13 of thefonts, namely the Courier, Times,a nd Helvetica fonts, (in normal, italic,bold and bold italic), and a symbol font.andP;  Chaning the emulation is easilydone without having to switch off the printer.andM;In PostScript Batch mode the NEC was totally compatible with the AppleLaserWriter, even down to speed.andP;  Recently, I have been using a PostScriptbenchmark test supplied with the Trading Post PostScript printer utility.andO;The test prints out a page of text and graphics, including a test print ofthe tonal range, a test of the printer's ability to produce fine lines and alisting of the resident fonts.andM;The test is a measure of the speed at which the PostScript benchmark file isinterpreted by the PostScript interpreter built into the printer, as much asit's an example of the quality of the printed output.andM;The quality of output was generally of a high standard within the constraintsof a 300dpi resolution.andP;  The printer was able to lay down a very good denseblack, and reproduce grey shades with reasonable differentiation.andM;The NEC turned in a speed only 20 per cent faster than the Apple LaserWriter.andO;This compares with Qume's PostScript-compatible CrystalPrint Publisher, whichturned over the benchmark test more than four times as fast as the NEC.andP;  Ourown PC User PostScript benchmark kept the NEC buzzing for a full 25 minutes,about half as fast as the Ricoh PostSCript printer.andM;A single page printed out doesn't measure the printer's ability to sustainits claimed eight pages per minute rate while in full flow.andP;  Here the NEC wasmore in tune.andM;Although it's rather slow to start with, the SilentWriter is likely to behighly reliable in service, andit comes furnished with enough memory for themost demanding of PostScript pages.andM;Genicom 6142andM;Genicom's 6142 is a PostScript-compatible laser printer, but that's only thehalf of it.andP;  It uses the Canon 400dpi SX engine, and has its own nativelanguage, ACE, which turns out prettier pages faster than PostScript.andO;Prettier, of course, because the jump from 300dpi to 400dpi resolution makesa vast difference in appearance on paper.andM;ACE is a page description language developed in England by Chelgraph fortheir typesetters.andP;  Like PostScript, it's device-independent, and makes useof scaleable fonts.andP;  It isn't programmable language like PostScript, but acommand set, similar to the Computer Graphics Metafile description.andM;ACE is actually the communication component of Chelgraph's Raster ImageProcessor (RIP).andP;  The Chelgraph RIP uses a Motorola 68000 processor workingin tandem with an AMD bitslice processor.andP;  The bitslice processor extractsfonts from the outline data and controls the actual printing process, whilethe Motorola 68000 interprets the ACE commands coming from the application,and then creates a display list.andM;Printing is much faster than with PostScript because the page is actuallyprinted directly from the information in the display list as the paper feedsthrough.andP;  PostScript printers must eventually create a bitmap which is heldin memory until the whole page is ready to be printed.andP;  Using the VenturaScoop and Capability pages confirmed that ACE is quite a lot faster thanPostScript.andM;The Canon's 400dpi SX print engine is capable of eight pages per minute insustained operation, and the increased resolution smooths out most of thtejagged edges on fine lines, that are discernible on a 300dpi page printer.andM;The 6142 also emulates an HP LaserJet series II, an HP 7475A plotter, an IBMgraphics printer and a Diablo 630 daisywheel printer.andP;  The plotter emulationis a bit unusual for an office printer, but it ties in nicely with graphicssoftware for presentations, like Harvard, and with spreadsheet graphs, fromprograms like SuperCalc.andP;  Each emulation has a full description in themanuals, and can be completely configured from the front panel.andM;The configuration is the familiar step-through process, and you can changesettings on the fly, for instance, to switch from ACE to LaserJet and back.andO;As most software doesn't yet know about ACE, Genicom supplies a series ofdrivers and an easy install program.andM;Drivers for Ventura Publisher, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Windows 286 and 386,AutoCAD Release 9 and 10, and GEM 3 are included.andP;  The install program copiesthe requisite files to the relevant directory on your hard disk.andP;  For theVentura and Windows drivers that I installed, all that was then necessary wasto choose the ACE driver which appeared in the Ventura and Windows printeroptions boxes.andM;The 6142 comes with 3Mb of RAM installed, and 15 fonts.andP;  This costs 3,795pounds sterling.andP;  For less intensive pages, the Genicom 6140 has 1Mb ofmemory, and costs 3,297 pounds sterling.andP;  Extra fonts must be purchased fromGenicom as a Font upgrade kit which adds a further 22 fonts at a cost of 500pounds sterling.andP;  The 6142 with 37 fonts therefore cost 4,295 poundssterling, and should cope with almost anything you can throw at it.andP;  Apartfrom true Adobe fonts, of course.andP;  The ITC fonts are licensed by Genicom, butyou'll have to make do with Tempus, Genicom, and Palisade, instead of Times,Helvetica, and Palatino.andP;  There were no incompatibilities with Ventura orWindows due to the name differences, though.andM;During September, after we had used the 6142 for a while, Genicom introducedGeniScript, the company's own page description language.andP;  Shortly before thisreview was completed, Genicom replaced the printer with one containing, inaddition to the original emulations, the GeniScript interpreter.andP;  Initialinvestigation showed it to be compatible, but rather slow.andP;  Genicom says thatthis is due to the version I looked at being a prototype.andP;  The first prioritywas to make it GeniScript compatible.andP;  Now that Genicom has achieved that,the interpreter will be speeded up.andM;The only other 400dpi printer I know of is the PostScript-compatible printerfrom Headway, which costs 4,950 pound sterling.andP;  Headway's printer uses anIcon expansion card to control the same Canon SX engine as the Genicom.andO;Canon recently decided to release the 400dpi engine on a general basis toOEMs, so we wll be seeing more of these high-resolution printers, probablyaround the middle of next year.andM;Countdown to chaos?andM;The deal between Apple and Microsoft over font technology for the Macintosh,OS/2's Presentation Manager and Windows for DOS has some importantimplications for the official Adobe PostScript market, and for companiesalready shipping or working on PostScript clones.andM;First, the deal means that Microsoft will use Apple's Royal outline fonttechnology for its screen fonts and for use on printers that don't usePostScript.andP;  In return, Apple has the rights to use the PostScript clonebought by Microsoft From Bauer Enterprises rather than the official Adobeversion.andP;  So, neither Apple nor Microsoft will continue to support AdobePostScript, with Apple building the Bauer interpreter into its newLaserWriters.andM;In response, Adobe immediately said that it would open up its proprietaryfont technology, so that third-party font developers and PostScript clonedesigners could implement the secret 'hints' that have so far given Adobe'sencrypted PostScript fonts the market edge.andM;What does this meand for PC users?andP;  First, users who've already invested inPostScript printers and fonts will still be able to use them, whatever thescreen font technology in use.andP;  Apple's Royal technology is designed so thatif it finds a PostScript font already loaded in the printer, that font isused in place of the Royal version.andP;  The opening up of the Adobe Type 1 fontspecifications will make it easier for Microsoft and Apple to develop theBauer interpreter to use any Adobe fonts which users happen to own alongsideroyal versions.andP;  More, these developments will make it easier for otherPostScript clone producers to handle Adobe fonts successfully, and for fontvendors to reassure users that their fonts are just as good and compatible asAdobe's.andM;But in the end, there will be confusion.andP;  Where there was one output standardin the shape of Adobe PostScript, there will now be two competing standards.andM;On one side is the Royal/Bauer set-up, with only Royal outline fonts producedby manufacturers like Bitstream and no Adobe input at all, and on the otheris the PostScript set-up with Adobe Type Manager or Display PostScript on thescreen, PostScript printer, and fonts from Adobe and many other compatibleproducers.andP;  there will also be mixtures of Royal screen fonts and PostScriptprinters, although the reverse is unlikely.andM;The user's decision isn't likely to depend on the rival merits of thetechnologies, but on the final output device.andP;  For users with laser printersor other high-quality non-PostScript output devices, royal fonts can producehigh-quality output from WYSIWYG screens, but only for text.andP;  For PostScriptusers, there seems little point in using Royal for screen fonts -- Adobe TypeManager can put printer fonts on screen for WYSIWYG results.andM;Most important of all is the way the typesetter manufacturers will jump.andP;  Atpresent Adobe PostScript is supported by the major typesetting companies andthose companies must have some doubts about the wisdom of changing to anotherstandard.andP;  Who will be in charge of the future direction of PostScript?andP;  Willit be Adobe, or Apple and Microsoft with the possible backing of IBM?andM;What's certain is that as long as the typesetter companies work with Adoberather than anyone else, the Royal/Bauer combination will be forced tosupport the Adobe PostScript standard in great detail just so that outputfiles can be sent to typesetting machines and work successfully.andP;  But, withthe Adobe font specifications open, that will be easier to do, and there willnow be competition to see whose interpreter can handle Adobe fonts faster,while still remaining typesetter-compatible.andP;  For now, users will just haveto take Royal and Bauer font and PostScript compatibility as read, and trustthe font suppliers who say that Royal, Adobe and other PostScript fonts willbe able to mix and match.andM;That trust must be earned, and it's likely that Adobe PostScript will remainthe standard until the proof is forthcoming.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
