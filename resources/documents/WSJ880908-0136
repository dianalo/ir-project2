Fred Singer's &quot;Fact and Fancy on Greenhouse Earth&quot; (editorial page, Aug. 30) reads like an excuse to reiterate old canards on conservation (it can only &quot;nibble&quot; at carbon dioxide) and renewable energy (solar cells for a family would cover &quot;a football field&quot;), and resuscitate nuclear power (the &quot;only realistic, abundant, economic and widely accepted energy source that produces no greenhouse effect&quot;). Mr. Singer's prescription is 180 degrees wrong.    After three decades as governments' most favored energy source, nuclear power provides about 5% of global energy use. For nuclear to replace half the world's current fossil energy use, amid 3% annual economic growth, nations would need to build 16 new large reactors per week between 1995 and 2020. This is almost 50 times the rate achieved during the peak nuclear construction decade (1975-1985). The associated cost, controversy, risk of failure, and economic disruption are beyond imagining.    To accomplish the same goal (a 50% cut in current carbon dioxide emissions) with improved energy efficiency would require 4.6% per year increases in the world's gross national product/energy ratio. This is about 60% faster than the rate the U.S. achieved during 1978-1986, or 35% faster than the rate in Japan. With consistent and aggressive government policies, including taxation and efficiency standards on vehicles, appliances and buildings, this is within reach. (We dislike taxes as much as the next person, but how else will fossil fuel prices reflect environmental risks?)    Renewable energy also produces no carbon dioxide, so increasing its contribution (via biomass, solar, wind and hydro) can relieve energy efficiency of some of the burden of curbing the greenhouse effect. Based on the most extensive study of U.S. renewable energy potential, by the Solar Energy Research Institute, deployment of renewable sources costing up to $1.50 per gallon of gasoline, combined with a mere 10% boost in U.S. energy efficiency over the 1978-1986 growth rate, would lead to a nearly 40% drop in domestic fossil fuel use within 15 years. Such a strategy would also make expanded nuclear power unnecessary and more than halve coal use, with concomitant reductions in acid rain.
