The survey, conducted Tuesday and Wednesday, found that68% of the 800 persons polled believe the U.S. has the upperhand in the conflict, an increase from a Journal/NBC poll 21/2 weeks earlier, when 52% said the U.S. held the upperhand.</LP><TEXT>   In the earlier poll, those polled were almost evenlydivided over whether the U.S. will be able to obtain itsobjectives without a shooting war. They now say by a marginof 52% to 36% that the U.S. will prevail without a war.   Some 84% of those surveyed say the U.S. should respondmilitarily if Iraq attacks Saudi Arabia, up from 74% in theearlier poll; 56%, up from 43%, support military action ifIraq fails to withdraw from Kuwait. And 72% believe the U.S.should take military action if hostages are harmed.   &quot;Resolve and support for the U.S. action is a littlestronger than it was two weeks ago,&quot; say pollsters PeterHart, a Democrat, and Robert Teeter, a Republican, whoconducted the poll for the Journal and NBC. They ascribe thisto the fact that &quot;all our pieces are now in place in theMiddle East, and there hasn't been some unforeseen blow-up,&quot;such as a terrorist attack on U.S. targets.   Those polled don't expect a rapid conclusion to thecrisis. Nearly two out of three believe U.S. troops will bein Saudi Arabia for at least six months, and four in 10believe the troops will stay more than a year.   Only 15% think the mission of the U.S. and its alliesshould be limited to protecting Saudi Arabia; 43% say theU.S. should also regain control in Kuwait, and 31% say theU.S. should invade Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein.   Some 50% of those polled say the most important reason theU.S. is in Saudi Arabia is to protect the world's oil supply.But they remain strongly opposed to the use of force toachieve economic goals. Asked whether they support the use offorce if the U.S. develops a shortage that raises gasolineprices to more than $2 a gallon, 71% say no, up from 64% lastmonth. And 57%, up from 50%, oppose the use of force even ifoil shortages threaten a major recession and close down somefactories.   Despite perception that the U.S. will prevail without ashooting war, two-thirds of those polled believe the worst isstill ahead for the U.S., and they are still closely split onthe question of whether economic sanctions and a blockadewill achieve the nation's objectives. Overall, the poll found76% support for the deployment of troops to Saudi Arabia and75% approval of President Bush's handling of the crisis,small increases from the earlier survey.   Support for the U.S. action remains strong amongpractically all demographic groups. The only exception isthat black voters remain consistently more skeptical of U.S.action in the Gulf than whites.   The generally increasing optimism in the poll on theMideast didn't extend to the U.S.'s domestic circumstances.About 58% of those surveyed believe the U.S. is headed for arecession in the next 12 months, unchanged from last month'ssurvey, when recession fears sharply increased for the firsttime this year.   By a 45% to 40% margin, voters said things in the U.S. aregenerally going in the right direction. That is similar tothe results of a July Journal/NBC poll, but represents asignificant decline in optimism from earlier in the year.   The poll found no consensus on how to pay for sending U.S.troops to the Middle East. The most popular option, backed by38% of voters, is to let the federal budget deficit increaseuntil the crisis ends. Some 27% say domestic spending shouldbe cut, and 18% endorse a temporary tax increase. (However,three in 10 of those favoring spending cuts don't think theycould be big enough to pay for the increased military costs.)   On the question of defense spending, 61% support keepingsuch spending at about the same level, with the remainingrespondents about evenly split between cutting and increasingdefense spending. In a slightly different question asked lastNovember, 59% of voters supported keeping defense spendingabout the same, while 28% favored cutting it and 10% favoredan increase.   ---   `Which of the following do you think will be the ultimateresult of our actions in the Middle East?'
