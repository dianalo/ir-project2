The variety in technical maturity of the renewableenergy technologies is reflected in the non-uniform funding levels amongthe five constituent programs. The greatest support is allotted to solarenergy in recognition of its enormous potential, both in low to mid-temperaturethermal and in photovoltaic applications. This report describes the technicalcontent of these five renewable energy and R andamp; D programs, and outlinesthe organization and management structures used to direct the effort.Biomass energy R andamp; D concentrates on the harvesting, processing and conversionof wood wastes into convenient fuel forms. Near-term applications willcontinue to be in the forest products industries. Wind energy R andamp; D ingeothermal energy are focussed on identification and quantification ofthe resource. A five-megawatt experimental geothermal heating systemis being established at the University of Regina. The hydraulic energyR andamp; D program does not consider conventional hydro-electric systems whichare well developed; rather, it primarily covers laboratory-scale testson conversion devices for wave, tidal, and river flow energy systems.A substantial effort is also underway in analytic and modelling techniquesfor hydraulic energy systems of all types. 3 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
