The weapon: computer chips that can mimic the phonecompanies' voice-mail services while replacing the tapes andmotors that make conventional answering machines troublesome.</LP><TEXT>   The latest entries are new chips from two Californiacompanies, National Semiconductor Inc. of Santa Clara andclosely held DSP Group Inc. of San Jose. Both chips are&quot;digital-signal processors,&quot; which translate speech into thedigital code of ones and zeros that computer chipsunderstand. The companies say their chips will allow phonemakers to build answering machines that, among other things,are the size of a card deck and can offer voice-mail boxesfor a number of different people.   &quot;This offers the user a great deal more horsepower,&quot; saysPhillip Gibson, manager of National Semiconductor'soffice-automation business.   The trouble with consumer-oriented machines that usecassette tapes is that they aren't as smart or fast asmachines that use chips alone. To call up a specific messagefrom a tape, for instance, a consumer would have to wait forthe tape to cycle through several messages. That makes itimpractical to build a tape machine that lets several userscall a machine for their individual messages. What's more,the mechanical parts of tape-based machines are prone to wearout and break.   Those are the weaknesses the regional phone companies aretrying to exploit. U S West Inc. and others have begunoffering residential voice mail for around $5 a month. Suchsystems can direct incoming phone messages to electronic mailboxes for as many as eight different family members, and somecan forward messages to other phone numbers.   All-digital answering machines are already available fromsuch companies as American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Corp., butmost don't offer such features as mail boxes. They are moreexpensive than tape machines and typically hold only sevenminutes of messages. Moreover, the chips in the machinescan't reproduce human voices as well as tape, says MichaelTroetti, assistant general manager of the home-officeelectronics division at the Panasonic Co. unit of Japan'sMatsushita Electric Industrial Co. &quot;Digital answeringmachines at the moment don't offer any advantage to the enduser,&quot; he says.   The new chips seek to change that. National Semiconductorsays its new chip, an $18 device called the AM160, will soongo into answering machines that, among other features, canstore and forward messages. The chip combines functions thatnormally require four or more chips, Mr. Gibson says, andwill allow phone makers to build answering-machine functionsinto just about anything, such as telephones and cellularphones. And the chips will deliver voice quality that matchesthat of tape machines, he adds.   By late next year, Mr. Gibson says, the new chips will beable to squeeze ten times more messages than today's digitalanswering machines can hold. Among interested parties areATandamp;T, which plans to present a paper at a conference Thursdayon how the chip can be built into answering machines.   DSP Group, which already sells processors to Japanese andU.S. companies, plans to unveil a set of chips next week thatit says will allow answering machines to offer privatemailboxes and message-forwarding, and to play back messagesfaster or slower than normal speed without affecting the toneof the speaker's voice. The four-year-old company says 20electronics companies plan to use the $30 chip set, includingfour big Japanese makers. Eventually, DSP Group says, thechips will be able to recognize voices. &quot;You'll be able tocall your machine and say, `Give me my messages,'&quot; says JohnLee, DSP Group's director of consumer products.   Even companies that have resisted the move to all-digitalanswering machines are shifting to chips. Matsushita, one ofthe biggest sellers of answering machines in the U.S., saysit plans to use either the National Semiconductor or DSPGroup chip sometime next year. The Baby Bells are apparentlygetting into the act, too. DSP Group says several of thephone companies plan to buy machines from Taiwan that use theDSP Group's chips.</TEXT></DOC>
