Dai-Ichi's investment in the Fort Wayne, Ind., multilineinsurer is dwarfed by the $5.25 billion acquisition ofFarmers Group by B.A.T Industries of Britain in 1988. Butanalysts and investment bankers believe Dai-Ichi's alliancewith Lincoln National could signal the beginning of moreJapanese investment in U.S. insurance companies.</LP><TEXT>   Japanese financial-services companies made majorinvestments in several securities and money-management firmsduring the 1980s, but their involvement in the U.S. insuranceindustry has until now been limited.   &quot;There will be more globalization going both ways,&quot;especially since there is a growing perception thatfinancial-services companies will have to be both bettercapitalized and global to compete in the 1990s, says WilliamYankus, an insurance industry analyst with Conning andamp; Co.   Yet, the Japanese may follow a different path forinvestment in U.S. insurers than European companies have,bankers say. In the last 10 years, British, European andScandinavian insurers have scooped up entire U.S. insurancecompanies. Besides Farmers Group, other major acquisitionsinclude Prudential PLC's purchase of Jackson National LifeInsurance Co., Zurich Insurance Co.'s acquisition of MarylandCasualty Co., and Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A.'s plannedacquisition of BMA Corp.'s Business Men's Assurance Co. unit.   Gary Parr, a managing director with Wasserstein Perella andamp;Co. in New York, which served as Lincoln National'sinvestment banker on the Dai-Ichi transaction, believes theJapanese will take minority positions when investing in theinsurance industry, the same technique they have employedwhen delving into the securities industry.   The Japanese see obvious advantages in such an approach,according to Mr. Parr. For example, it will allow Dai-Ichi,Japan's second-largest life insurer, to learn about newmarkets, study products and distribution systems, and alsoservice U.S. clients through affiliated companies.   Carol Manning at Smith Barney Harris Upham says Japanesefinancial-services firms also are eager to find ways todiversify their investments. &quot;When they can find awell-managed U.S. life insurance company, {it} presents anattractive investment.&quot;   The proposed transaction offers Lincoln National a chanceto boost its already-strong balance sheet by acquiringcapital &quot;on a very attractively priced basis,&quot; President IanM. Rolland said in an interview. Analysts said the investmentby Dai-Ichi allowed Lincoln to raise equity capital on farbetter terms than it could have gotten if it sold convertiblestock on the open market.   Mr. Rolland also cited the opportunity the alliance offers&quot;to enter into a number of strategic relationships withDai-Ichi.&quot; As part of the agreement, Lincoln National and theTokyo concern plan to develop &quot;reciprocal businessrelationships&quot; in the areas of investment management,reinsurance, pension products and group health products.   Also a plus, Mr. Rolland said, is &quot;having a shareholderthat understands the life insurance business and will take along-term view.&quot; As part of the agreement, Dai-Ichi signed astandstill pact under which it pledged not to boost itsvoting stake above 9.8%, or to participate in any groupgathering shares. The pact also requires Dai-Ichi to hold theshares into 1993, and places restrictions on how the companycan trade them after that date.   Under terms of the agreement, Dai-Ichi will purchase twonew series of Lincoln National convertible preferred stock: a5% stake through one issue of convertible preferred stock anda 4.6% share through a second series of convertible preferredwithin a year.   The planned alliance will &quot;enhance Lincoln National'sability to deal in the global marketplace,&quot; said Legg MasonWood Walker analyst Frederick Sandburg. But the agreement&quot;doesn't mean a whole lot, short-term, in terms of thecompany's earnings,&quot; he noted.   Takahide Sakurai, president of Dai-Ichi Mutual, said in astatement that the company considers Lincoln National &quot;ahighly regarded and soundly managed company,&quot; adding that thetransaction &quot;offers us a good investment opportunity.&quot;   Lincoln National offers life and property-casualtyinsurance as well as employee-benefit programs. In 1988, thecompany took a $67.1 million charge to dispose of certainunprofitable health-maintenance organizations; the remainingHMO's recently returned to profitability and analystsconsider that once-troubled operation to have turned thecorner.   In May, Lincoln completed the sale of its NationalReinsurance unit to an investor group that includes financierRobert M. Bass; it received $320.1 million in cash and $75million in preferred stock. Those funds, and the money to bereceived from the Dai-Ichi plan, will be used to pay downdebt, said Lincoln.   The agreement between Dai-Ichi and Lincoln National willtake effect after the required waiting period under theHart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, the companiessaid.   ---   James P.
