<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-28-1053 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new concept in high-power waveguide couplers for ion cyclotron rangeof frequencies heating is described. The structure consists of a periodicarray of interleaved metallic vanes within a rectangular enclosure. Itis analogous to a wide rectangular waveguide that has been folded severaltimes to form a more compact structure. The frequency range of the waveguideis determined by the number of folds in the structure.</TEXT></DOC>
