The developments indicated that China's fledgling studentmovement, the biggest in its 40-year history, faces seriousorganizational problems.   The United Association of Beijing Universities, an independentgroup that has organized three weeks of demonstrations, urged thatstudents head back to class and continue their campaign through``speeches, plays and pamphlets.''   More than 70,000 Beijing students have been boycotting classessince April 24, and students at many schools began returning toclass Friday following a huge protest at Tiananmen Square.   But at Beijing University, students ignored the plea.   Each dormitory room received a ballot, and the final tally was865 rooms to 303 in favor of continuing the boycott, with more than100 rooms abstaining. Each dormitory room sleeps six to eightstudents.   Some students at Beijing Normal University also said they wouldstay out of school.   Activists said they wanted to continue the strike because theywere not satisfied with the results of the student movement.   ``We must continue to pressure the government and struggle untilthe movement is victorious,'' said one student leader. ``Thegovernment has given us nothing. They still call us illegal.''   But members of the United Association said they were satisfiedwith the results of the campaign and did not think it would bepossible to hold any new protests.   ``The main thing we created was an atmosphere,'' said WangZhixin, a student leader from the College of Politics and Law. ``Wehave brought the word `democracy' into the lives of the people ofChina.''   Another student group representing at least 24 universities sentan appeal to the government and ruling Communist Party on Saturdayfor a dialogue on the students' demands for democracy and an end tocorruption.   The two-page appeal was sent two days after Communist Partychief Zhao Ziyang made a conciliatory call for dialogue.   The new group, the Student Dialogue Representative group, wasformed after the government refused to meet with the UnitedAssociation, which it declared illegal.   Also Saturday, The Legal Daily reported that a railway workerwas sentenced to death for participating in violence triggered byan April 22 student march in Xian.   The sentence was the first report of punishment meted out sincethe demonstrations began April 15, after the death of oustedCommunist Party leader Hu Yaobang.   The daily said Zhang Jun was on trial with 900 other peopleaccused of attacking government offices in Xian following a studentmarch. It did not say if anyone else was sentenced.</TEXT></DOC>
