 Networld Boston was good, moremanageable than the one in Dallas.andP;  Comdex is a zoo.andP;  Interop was the best.andO;It is a techie's show.andP;  It's more than an exhibition; it's a conference withsome of the best seminars on cutting-edge technology in the business.andP;  Theattendees are those who make the real decisions on what's needed to solvecomputing problems.andP;  Engineers roved he aisles.andP;  We didn't have to fightthrough glitzy displays to find interesting products--or the people whodesigned them.andM;Unlike many trade shows, Interop required the exhibitors to participate in anetwork.andP;  The most exciting of these was the FDDI network.andP;  FDDI, or FiberDistributed Data Interface, is an upcoming ANSI standard for a100m-bits-per-second fiber optic network.andP;  Until Interop, FDDI was mostlytalk and little product.andP;  The standards work has been going on for six years,with much infighting about the nitty gritty, such as what connector will bethe standard.andP;  Three out of the four parts of the standard are complete andin publication: Media Access Control (MAC), Physical Layer Protocol (PHY),and the Physical Media Dependent (PMD).andP;  The Station Management (SMT) isstill in debate.andM;Eight vendors displayed their wares on the show's FDDI network, the firstpublic FDDI demonstratin in the U.S.andP;  The FDDI network was conceived of andput together at the last minute.andP;  Despite the rush job, the first bits flyingover an Interop network were light over glass.andP;  The FDDI network was upbefore they showed Ethernet, the Show-n-Tel Net.andM;The night before the show began, FDDI vendors tried each products, and sinceall combinations worked, they plugged in all the devices to the FDDI network.andO;Two levels of interoperability were demonstrated.andM;The first level was the ANSI SMT protocol for Connection Management, or CMTand SMT frames.andP;  CMT is a section of SMT that deal with establishing a ringand determining when to wrap based on a filing link in the ring.andP;  SMT framesallow the identification of neighbors and the collection of statisticalframes for station management.andP;  Every FDDI vendor will need to perform CMTand SMT properly if their products are to interoperate.andP;  The second level isthe interoperability of the TCP/IP protocol stack, including Telnet forterminal emulation.andM;Since it builds the FDDI chipset, Advanced Micro Devices was a major playerinthe FDDI network.andP;  On the workstation front, HP-Apollo, Silicon Graphics,and Sun Microsystems showed products or prototypes of FDDI interfaces.andP;  CMCstrutted its FDDI adapter for VMEbus systems.andP;  For those who want FDDI allthe way, Unisys was showing a multiuser system built around FDDI and an IProuter for connection of Ethernet and FDDI networks.andM;Internetworking products were popular on this demonstration network, sincemost people will implement FDDI in pieces.andP;  Fibermux showed its Token Ringbridge, Ethernet bridge, and TCP/IP router, all with interfaces for FDDInetworks.andP;  Fibronics was no stranger to the FDDI network.andP;  Besides being amember of the ring, its FDDI network management software managed the entirenetwork, keeping attendees up to date on items such as performance andconfiguration.andP;  The NSFNET's prototype demonstrated TCP/IP internetworkingbetween local and long-haul networks using FDDI.andP;  Network Systems showed itsFDDI product in its DX line of Internet Protocol Routers.andP;  Network Systemsrouters can connect FDDI to Ethernet, T-1, or T-3.andP;  Proteon, too,demonstrated its FDDI router.andM;SNMP ManagesandM;If FDDI is just hatching out of it shell, then Simple Network ManagementProtocol (SNMP) is trying out its new wings.andP;  SNMP allows systems to exchangemanagement information.andP;  Through this protocol, administrators can query andcommand host computers.andP;  SNMP monitors network performance and status,controls operational parameters, and reports, analyzes and isolates faults.andO;Although SNMP came out of the TCP/IP environment, it is not tied to theprotocol and can operate over virtually any network media or protocol stack.andO;This gives it a great advantage over competing management protocols.andM;This year's Interop lacked last year's heated SNMP vs.andP;  CMOT vs.andP;  CMIPdebate.andP;  Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) is OSI's networkmanagement protocol.andP;  Its advocates are right: CMIP is more powerful thanSNMP.andP;  However, not many OSI networks are implemented today.andP;  People need toconnect various computers now so they turned to TCP/IP.andP;  They also turned toSNMP to manage the networks.andP;  CMOT or CMIP over TCP/IP is a migration pathfrom the TCP/IP standard to the OSI standard, at least when it comes tomanagement.andM;This year, SNMP was the hot topic.andP;  But that doesn't mean CMOT or CMIP aredead.andP;  Netlabs (Los Angeles, Calif.) was on hand, still insisting that CMOTis best, even though the company also offers SNMP software for developers.andM;Over 20 vendors partook in the SNMP demonstration.andP;  Different vendors'equipment can report to the same management station, if all have implementedthe agent portion.andP;  This happened at Interop.andP;  Some vendors announcedmanagement packages, such as Advanced Computer Communications and Hughes LANSystems.andP;  Some showed SNMP-based managers that they have been shipping forawhile, such as Proteon.andP;  Others, including Cabletron, Prime, and TRW,demonstrated that their products could be managed by SNMP.andP;  Many, such asCMC, showed the technology and promised products.andM;OSI Here We ComeandM;Since Interop is a meeting of university and government networking gurus,TCP/IP naturally figures in big.andP;  And just as logically, OSI is in theirfuture.andP;  A recent study from the market research firm Infonetics (SantaClara, Calif.) shows that TCP/IP users are dissatisfied with the commitmentnetwork vendors have made to OSI.andP;  Before people will buy OSI products, thestudy says, the manufacturers have to demonstrate interoperability.andP;  That's areasonable request.andM;The seminar on X.400, X.500 and document interchange was packed.andP;  People arehungry for information about OSI applications.andP;  But alas, few applicationsare here today.andP;  And while people stood three-deep to get a peek at Sun's newSunNet Manager, the OSI and OSI over NetBIOS demonstrations were far lesscrowded.andM;The OSI network not only included the lower layers solutions, such as bridgesand routers, but also the products for application layers, electronic mail,and file transfer products.andP;  Thirteen vendors participated.andP;  CMC and ciscodemonstrated ISO routers, but CMC showed its product only over X.25 whilecisco wowed people by routing ISO traffic over Token Ring and X.25.andP;  Proteonshowed its ISO router for Ethernet and Token Ring.andP;  Hughes showed its OSIcompatible bridge for Token Bus.andM;On the applications side, both Touch and Retix were showing off their X.400electronic mail gateways.andP;  For a good look at X.400 as well as file transferusing FTAM, we ambled over to Unisys's demonstration.andM;X.400 products are just becoming a reality.andP;  The standard for X.500 isn'tquite finished.andP;  If you need OSI now but still must have your PCapplications, think about NetBIOS over OSI.andP;  The North American MAP/TOPUsers' Group NetBIOS Technical Migration Committee created the OSI/NetBIOSspecification so you can run existing NetBIOS applications over OSI.andP;  TheOSI/NetBIOS architecture uses a four-layer subset of the TOP OSIarchitecture, namely the Physical through Transport Layers.andP;  Above that runsNetBIOS and its support protocols.andP;  Using this architecture, ordinary NetBIOSapplications can run on OSI.andM;ATandamp;T, a French company called RCE, 3Com, and Ungermann-Bass participated inthis demonstration.andP;  The 3Com, RCE, and Ungermann-Bass servers ran OS/2; theATandamp;T server ran UNIX.andP;  All four of the workstations ran DOS.andM;Looking InandM;Another Interop demonstration centered around the X Window System.andP;  Developedat MIT, X Window represents graphics on different machines in a heterogeneousnetwork.andP;  X is structured around the client-server model, except that what itcalls a server actually runs on a workstation.andP;  It's closer to what non-Xpeople call a client.andP;  Despite the backward (depending on your point of view)terminology, X allows less powerful computers to log into larger computersand take advantage of them without buying graphics terminals for each user.andM;Ten vendors displayed their X wares, including biggies such as Apple, DEC,and IBM.andP;  Apple showed its MacX, X softwre for the Mac II, DEC had DECwindowson hand, and IBM showed sample VM and MVS TCP/IP applications which used Xclients.andP;  It also showed X on AIX and DOS.andP;  Network Research and Prime showedtheir client-server software.andP;  Sun displayed OpenWindows its X11 developmentenvironment.andP;  Tektronics, Tronics, and U-tron wre showing X terminals.andM;Hummingbird's product can turn a DOS PC into an X terminal.andP;  HCL-eXceed fromthis Markham, Ontario, Canada company is software for 286 or 386 PCs runningDOS and TCP/IP that permits the user to use X applications.andP;  Many PC peopleneed access to UNIX hosts, but are not willing to trade their PC for aterminal.andP;  HCL-eXceed is one way to keep your PC, get a prettier interfaceand get to the X applications.andM;Show-n-Tel NetandM;The Show-n-Tel Net, the official show network, was something to behold.andO;Philip Almquist, a consultant, and Peter de Vries of Advanced ComputingEnvironment (the people who put on Interop) designed the network.andP;  Manyvendors helped.andP;  They did an impressive job.andM;On the five miles of cable sat over 500 hosts and gateways from 90 vendors.andO;The Network Operations Center, residing in ACE's booth, was the brain.andP;  A Sunworkstation ran Sun's SunNet Manager which monitored and controlled devicesin 15 booths.andP;  From there, people could control and watch the machines'operations in the vendors' booths.andP;  The network was configured as a star,which are network segments consisting of thin, thick, and twisted pair andfiber optic Ethernet, Token Ring, FDDI and T-1.andP;  It ran both TCP/IP and OSIprotocols.andP;  Additionally, attendees could pick up or send electronic mailfrom the Show-n-Tel Net in three places.andM;Management Is AllandM;Connectivity isn't enough.andP;  It isn't sufficient to connect two networks on acampus.andP;  It isn't even satisfactory to connect your Ethernet in New York toyour Ethernet in San Francisco.andP;  Bridges and routers can handle theconnectivity, but as the network expands, management becomes the issue.andP;  Whenthe network administrator can't remember all the nodes, he or she had betterget software to help.andP;  Many bridge and router manufacturers have managementpackages for their hardware.andP;  If they don't have them shipping today, theyare furiously working on them (or else you should reconsider buying from thembecause they aren't watching the industry develop).andM;SunNet Manager from Sun Microsystems (Mountain View, Calif.) attracted muchattention.andP;  This new SNMP-based management software can monitor and controlcomputers, routers, communications protocols, network applications andservices, and other network devices.andP;  Because SunNet uses the OpenLookgraphical user interface, it is easy to use and pretty to look at.andM;SunNet not only shows the layout of the network, but it displays theactivities of each network device or segment.andP;  And like most networkmanagement packages, it can warn the network administrator of impending doomby watching for certain events.andP;  Most management packages use colors andbells to tell the network administrator, but SunNet adds electronic mail tothat list.andM;SunNet Manager supports SNMP as well as CMOT.andP;  But Sun has improved on SNMP.andO;SunNet Manager can allow network polling to be offloaded from the user'smanagement workstation.andP;  User configured event conditions can be applied toany Management Information Base (MIB) attribute, so that any type ofcondition can be monitored, not just those specified by SNMP.andM;Part of the SunNet line is SunLink.andP;  SunLink allows connectivity with IBM andDEC systems as well as PCs.andP;  SunNet Manager will be available in the firstquarter of 1990 for the Sun SPARC systems and the Sun-3/60 and Sun-3/80.andM;Advanced Computer Communications (Santa Barbara, Calif.) debuted itsSNMP-based network manager.andP;  The ACS 4800 in a Sun-3 or Sun-4 SPARCstation.andO;The three-dimensional display makes it easy for people to glean informationabout the network, and compare performance of the various segments.andP;  As youuse the ACS 4800's graphical map builder to create a map of the network, thesoftware builds a Rolodex style database, with one card for each device.andO;Once set up, the ACS 4800 polls these devices to update the cards.andP;  If thenode does not respond, the software knows something is amiss, and it notifiesthe administrator.andP;  It also initiates a polling sequence so that the devicesaround the failure help isolate the source.andP;  Bundled with the Sun-4, the ACSmanager costs $27,420.andP;  Without the workstation, it costs $9,500.andM;Hughes LAN Systems, formerly Sytek, introduced an SNMP-based network manageras well.andP;  The 9100 Network Management Center from this Mountain View, Calif.,andO;company not only manages routers, as the SNMP MIB provides for, but alsomanages Hughes terminal servers and bridges.andP;  The 9100 can do this onlybecause Hughes has extended the standard MIB.andM;Like the others, the 9100 provides for alarm reporting, notification, andhandling.andP;  Unlike most, it can recommend possible solutions.andP;  The Hughesmanagement product includes a relational database so a technician can make adhoc queries and updates.andP;  Through Structured Query Language (SQL), networkmanagers can dump, load, log and format reports.andP;  The 9100 runs on a Sun-3platform and has a graphical user interface.andP;  Available now, it costs$14,000.andM;Cabletron (Rochester, N.H.) announced its Ethernet wiring system will beginto support SNMP so that management packages from other vendors can be used tomonitor and control Cabletron's Ethernet hubs, local bridges and remotebridges.andP;  To show its solidarity for SNMP, Cabletron demonstrated Sun'sSunNet Manager managing its Ethernet products.andM;Cabletron wasn't the only company with SunNet in its booth.andP;  Network General(Mountain View, Calif.) announced SniffMaster I, a software package that runswith SunNet Manager.andP;  Now network administrators can analyze problems indistributed LANs from their chairs.andP;  The Sun workstation running SniffMasterlets the LAN administrator view multiple windows on the screen at the sametime.andP;  Information is relayed to the Sun from Sniffers in the field.andP;  Itdoesn't matter if the Sniffers are local or remote, in another room oranother city.andP;  It doesn't matter if one Sniffer is analyzing an Ethernetrunning TCP/IP and the another Sniffer is working on a Token Ring with IPX.andO;SniffMaster from this Mountain View, Calif.andP;  company costs $1,995.andP;  It wasmade available in December 1989.andM;Bridging And RoutingandM;Routers form the very essence of most TCP/IP networks.andP;  Routers allow networkmanagers to control what data goes where, helping not only performance butalso security.andP;  If the internetwork isn't as large, MAC--layer bridges arebetter.andP;  Bridges require much less attention.andP;  A technician plugs a bridgein, and it self-configures.andP;  A major debate for network administrators iswhether to bridge or to route.andP;  In a nutshell, bridges are better in smallnetworks where security isn't key.andP;  Routers are best in massive internetworksor where security is critical.andM;Proteon (Westboro, Mass.) announced its router now supports AppleTalk,Defense Data Network, X.15 and a new TCP/IP routing protocol.andP;  The mostexciting of these is the new TCP/IP routing protocol, Open Shortest PathFirst (OSPF).andM;RIP or Routing Information Protocol is the older, more commonly used protocolin TCP/IP networks, but it has severe limitations.andP;  RIP's update procedure isinefficient.andM;The whole routing table will be broadcast frequently throughout the network,and as the network grows, so does the routing table, and consequently morebandwidth is consumed.andP;  When a network contains over 100 routers, RIP is aclumsy protocol.andP;  Plus when a link fails, RIP's update procedure slows routediscovery and increases network traffic.andM;The OSPF is a far more sophisticated routing protocol, built for large TCP/IPinternetworks.andP;  During OSPF's update procedure, each router transmits apacket with a description of its local links to all other routers it knowsabout.andP;  The receivers must acknowledge.andP;  Because OSPF uses distributedrouting tables, it demands far less bandwith than RIP.andM;OSPF offers least cost routing, which RIP does not.andP;  This allows the routerto determine the most effective route based on relative loading, delay anddollar costs.andP;  This is essential in large networks, where there may be twopaths to a particular destination, but one uses a T-1 line and the other usesa 56K-bits-per-second leased line.andP;  Another improvement is routing overmultiple paths, which is used for load balancing.andM;OSPF is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force OSPF Working Group.andO;Those who want to implement OSPF should contact the Stanford ResearchInstitute, Network Information Center at Stanford University in Palo Alto,Calif.andM;Advanced Computer Communications (Santa Barbara, Calif.) has a smart approachto the bridge-router quandary.andP;  Buy a bridge today, and when you need arouter, ACC gives you the proper software on a diskette.andP;  This is not one ofthe self-proclaimed &quot;brouters,&quot; which in reality are MAC-layer bridges thatdo fancy packet filtering.andM;The ACS 4130 is a true IP router that connects TCP/IP networks via high-speedpoint-to-point or X.25 lines.andP;  But if you do not need a router, you can usethe same hardware for a MAC-layer bridge.andP;  Whether this hardware is a routeror a bridge is a matter of which floppy disk is loaded.andP;  The ACS 4130 isavailable now for $7,500.andM;Wellfleet Communications (Bedford, Mass.) was one of the first to market witha combination bridge/router.andP;  Wellfleet's is an innovative design, usingmultiple 68020 processors and a VMEbus to route IP and DECnet as well asbridge any protocol.andP;  Wellfleet's bridge/routers can be managed byWellfleet's SNMP Network Management Software.andM;At Interop, Wellfleet introduced a low-end bridge/router, called the FeederNode.andP;  The Feeder Node permits two LAN connections and two WAN connections.andO;The four-port device joins its siblings, the Link Node and the ConcentratorNode.andP;  The Link Node can make eight LAN and eight WAN connections; theConcentrator Node can support up to 26 LAN and 26 WAN connections.andP;  TheFeeder Node can bridge 11,700 packets per second and route 7,200 IP packetsper second.andP;  The Link Node can forward a total of 46,000 frames per secondand route 28,000 IP packets per second.andM;The difference between cisco's FDDI router and the competition, says SandyLerner, president and co-founder of this Menlo Park, Calif., company, is thecisco router can route 14 protocols and connect to FDDI networks, rather thanconnect to FDDI and route.andP;  For cisco, the emphasis is on &quot;router&quot; not&quot;FDDI.&quot;andM;Besides FDDI, the cisco router connects to Ethernet, Token Ring, X.25 ormultiple point to point lines.andP;  It can route TCP/IP, OSI, XNS, DECnet,AppleTalk and more.andP;  It uses cisco's new high-speed router chassis which addsto the earlier chassis' MultiBus backplane a 533M-bits-per-second cBusbackplane.andP;  The router will be available in the first quarter of 1990.andP;  Arouter that can connect two Ethernets and one FDDI network will cost around$38,000.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
