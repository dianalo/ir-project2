SchlenderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/04/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> IBM FDOS AAPLCOMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><TEXT>   Hundreds of companies make bargain-priced &quot;clones&quot; of International Business Machines Corp.'s PC-XT and PC-AT personal computers. In fact, analysts say, two-thirds of the 4.3 million personal computers sold in the U.S. this year will be IBM clones.    But Apple Computer Inc., which popularized personal computers a decade ago, has only two imitators, and they will be lucky to capture 3% of the 800,000 Apple II-type computers to be sold domestically in 1986, the market analysts say. (So far, no one has been able to copy Apple's more-expensive Macintosh computer.)    The difference is Apple's aggressive attitude toward the companies that make &quot;bad Apples,&quot; as some Apple employees call them.    Apple has avoided the avalanche of competition from makers of compatible machines, and the crumbling prices that come with them, by stubbornly defending patents and copyrights covering the design of its computers and programs. Since the early 1980s, that has meant pursuing some makers of Apple clones to their workshops in the Orient, and confronting their importers in costly court battles both in the U.S. and abroad.    &quot;We take the position that we have never seen an Apple-compatible unit that is not infringing either our patents or our copyrights or both,&quot; says Irving S. Rappaport, Apple's associate general counsel. &quot;There's no question it takes a constant vigilance, and the price of justice is expensive, but looking at what has happened to our competitors, we feel it is worth it.&quot;    IBM isn't in a position to be that aggressive. It decided when developing its PC to farm out work on the operating system and some hardware design to outside companies. By doing that, it lost some control over the rights to those designs.    But as tough as Apple has been, two manufacturers have apparently found ways to engineer around the legal obstacles, selling machines that function like Apple's IIe and IIc computers at prices 30% to 50% lower. How long they can prevail remains to be seen; Apple hasn't given up trying to stop either.    One of the manufacturers, Franklin Computer Corp., of Pennsauken, N.J., has been selling Apple-compatible computers, and jousting in court with Apple, since 1981. Franklin, which for a time had to ask for federal bankruptcy-court protection, finally reached an expensive settlement with Apple in 1984, agreeing to pay Apple $2.5 million and to refrain from infringing on Apple's operating system. Under the agreement, Apple can't challenge Franklin in court again until late next year.    Currently, Franklin sells a line of Apple IIe- and IIc-compatible machines that it says don't violate Apple's patents. The machines are sold through 600 Sears Roebuck andamp; Co. department stores, priced from $499 to $999, excluding a video monitor. Comparable Apple computers retail from about $750 to more than $1000. (Franklin also makes an IBM clone.)    The other manufacturer, Video Technology Computers Inc., a Northbrook, Ill.-based unit of a Hong Kong manufacturer, last May started selling its Laser 128 computers, which resemble Apple's IIc machine and cost about $475 without a monitor. Video Technology sells the machines through small computer stores, mail-order houses and a few regional department-store chains. Apple continues to pursue the company in Hong Kong courts, so far without much success.    Although Apple disputes it, David Gish, president of Video Technology, contends that &quot;It's been proven you can be compatible with Apple without infringing on patents or copyrights. It's just that in the Apple world there are more hurdles than in the IBM world.&quot;    The strategy for Franklin and Video Technology is to employ different circuits and combinations of parts to accomplish the same computing functions as an Apple II. That was easier for Video Technology, because it combined many of the functions on custom-designed computer chips that it has copyrighted itself. Franklin also uses custom chips in its newest machine.    Similarly, operating-system programs had to be written differently from Apple's and yet accommodate the same applications programs. Both Franklin and Video Technology use an operating system developed by Language Arts Inc., of Portland, Ore.    &quot;At the time we developed the operating system for the Apple II (clones), we thought there would be a bigger market than there turned out to be,&quot; says Michael Brown, president of Language Arts. &quot;Otherwise we wouldn't have invested the four man-years it took to write it.&quot;    Mr. Brown is also president of Cross Point Software Inc., a mail-order distributor that has sold &quot;thousands&quot; of Laser 128 computers. (He is perhaps best known for his &quot;lock-picking&quot; programs for copying software designed to be copy-proof.) Having been through the painstaking task of writing a compatible operating system, &quot;we knew we were very vulnerable to Apple's wrath, and there's no way we would have picked up this machine unless we knew it was as clean as our software.&quot;    Both manufacturers also have packed extra features into their machines, such as a separate numeric keypad, enhanced graphics capabilities and more computer memory. But the main selling point is price.    &quot;People come to me who can't see paying $1,000 or more for what is becoming a technologically obsolete machine,&quot; says Michael Zielinski, president of Software 1st, whose two Santa Rosa, Calif., stores sell three or four Laser 128s a month. &quot;That rainbow-colored apple on the case costs you several hundred dollars,&quot; he says.    Both Franklin and Laser owners swear by their machines. Charles Slowik, general manager of Northeast Aluminum Window Corp. in Philadelphia, has purchased 10 Franklins over the past five years. &quot;We turn them on at 6 in the morning and off at 5:30 every night, six days a week, and not a one of them has ever gone down on us,&quot; he says.    Richard Stephens, director of the learning center at Pacific Union College in Angwin, Calif., recently bought six Laser 128s so students there could take advantage of the profusion of educational software that runs only on Apple II-type computers.    &quot;I shook $6,500 loose and spent half of it on computers and about half on software,&quot; he says. &quot;If I had bought Apples, all I could have bought was the hardware.&quot;    Surprisingly, Franklin and Laser dealers don't see Apple as their main competitor. Says Mr. Brown of Cross Point Software, &quot;We're pricing the Laser 128 to go after the Commodore 64 and 128 owners who want to move up and tap into all the good Apple software but don't want to pay the price or can't afford to.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
