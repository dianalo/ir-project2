(DEC) VAXes use differentcommunications protocols, so a local MIS department would have to go througha gateway to connect these systems to an SMC system.andM;Operators of TCP/IP-compliant LANs who want to acquire the SMC system wouldalso have to get a Direct Data Network (DDN) host interface device and hostinterface software.andM;Several conference attendees expressed concern that they couldn't use SMC'sstandards to tie in many of their own departmental LANs.andP;  &quot;I use DEC servers,and they won't fit into this networking setup except by dialing up amainframe,&quot; said a Navy lieutenant commander who asked not to be identified.andO;Others said they were disappointed that there was no Mac or TCP/IPconnectivity incorporated into the SMC.andM;But the military leaders of the project defended it as a serious move to LANstandards for the entire military.andP;  &quot;We intend to tie in the past so allthose pieces -- Mac, DEC, TCP/IP -- will be able to link into the networkthrough DDN connections,&quot; said U.S.andP;  Army Lt.andP;  Col.andP;  Bill Jassle, the SMCproduct manager at Fort Monmouth, N.J.andP;  &quot;But this is a GOSIP standard, andthat is the way to the future, and we are sticking with standards.andP;  So we'renot going to rebuild SMC so it complies with all of these standards.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
