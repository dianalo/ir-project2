OATIS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Anti-nuclear activists marked the 44th anniversary Sunday of thebombing of Hiroshima with peaceful demonstrations at U.S. weaponsfacilities, including an attempt by an estimated 3,530 people tosurround a Colorado plant.   ``The people turned out to send a message to the president andthe world that we've got to stop the madness,'' said Steve Perry,who organized the protest at the troubled Rocky Flats weaponscomplex in Colorado.   At the Nevada Test Site near Mercury, authorities arrested 52demonstrators on trespass charges, said Department of Energyspokesman Darwin Morgan. Thirty protesters were arrested at theY-12 nuclear weapons plant in Oak Ridge, Tenn., which wasinstrumental in developing the atomic bomb that devastatedHiroshima.   In Groton, Conn., four men were arrested and charged withdisorderly conduct after they climbed aboard the USS Nautilus, theworld's first nuclear submarine, during a vigil by about 25 peopleto commemorate the anniversary.   Demonstrations were also held at the Savannah River Site inAiken, S.C.; Livermore, Calif.; the Colorado Capitol in Denver; theOhio State Fair in Columbus; Princeton University and at Elizabeth,N.J. A protest was also planned in Amarillo, Texas, where the firstbombs were assembled.   In Andersonville, Ga., American prisoners of war who died in theAug. 6, 1945, attack were honored Saturday with a 21-gun salute andthe playing of ``Taps.''   The protest at Rocky Flats, which makes plutonium triggers fornuclear weapons 16 miles northwest of Denver, appeared to be thelargest, but demonstrators still failed to fulfill their goal ofencircling the plant.   Organizers said 1,000 people per mile would be needed to joinhands around the plant's 17-mile perimeter. State police estimatedthat 3,530 people showed up for the 30-minute protest in chilly,windy weather and a light rain.   A folk group sang ``America,'' ``This Land Is Your Land,'' and``We Shall Overcome.''   The demonstration organized by a group called Colorado FreezeVoter had an environmental focus as well as an anti-war one.   Rocky Flats, Savannah River and the Feed Materials ProductionCenter in Fenald, Ohio, have been targets of allegations of safetyand environmental problems. FBI and Environmental Protection Agencyinvestigators raided Rocky Flats on June 6, and a federal grandjury began probing the plant on Tuesday.   At the Colorado Capitol, about 400 people listened to music andenvironmentalist speakers at a rally dedicated to the late Dr. CarlJohnson, a former county health director who more than 10 years agowarned that Rocky Flats endangered public health.   ``Rocky Flats is like a loaded gun in a children's bedroom,''said demonstrator Richard Chambers.   About 90 demonstrators at the Nevada Test Site held a prayervigil to remember those killed at Hiroshima, Morgan said. Most thenwalked on a road leading to the remote desert site, and 52 werecited for trespass. All were released.   ``It was very peaceful, very calm, very friendly,'' said Morgan.   In Livermore, photographs and paintings of Hiroshima after thebombing were displayed at a park, and a petition drive to makesurrounding Alameda County a nuclear-free zone was launched. Thenorthern California city is home to the Lawrence Livermore NationalLaboratory, a nuclear weapons research center.   At Savannah River, where plutonium is made, members of theenvironmental group Greenpeace held a vigil.   The Ohio fair's Peace Pavillion was the site of a demonstrationby 168 members of the Columbus Campaign For Arms Control, saidpavillion activities coordinator Shirley Owen.   Gov. Richard Celeste and his wife, Dagmar, attended a Japanesetea ceremony there earlier, Ms. Bowen said.   In Oak Ridge, Tenn., an estimated 300 to 350 people marched onthe Y-12 nuclear weapons plant. About 30 were arrested fortrespassing or interfering with arrest, said police Chief TimothyBraaten.   Among the approximately 140,000 people who died at Hiroshimawere nine U.S. airmen taken prisoner after their bombers were shotdown over Japan in July, 1945.   A bronze plaque honoring the nine was unveiled Saturday at theNational Prisoner of War Museum at the Andersonville NationalHistoric Site, where a notorious Civil War prison once stood.   The memorial 44 years later was a relief for Cathy Wheatley ofAtlanta, whose uncle, Airman 3rd Class Norman Roland Brissette, wasamong those killed.   ``For many years I was afraid that his death ... would beforgotten,'' she said. ``We're happy that it is finally beingrecognized.''</TEXT></DOC>
