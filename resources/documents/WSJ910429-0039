Tenneco is adding momentum to local efforts to renovatethe downtown area, develop lakefront condominiums and spruceup the harbor with a dockside restaurant. But the impetus soevident here seems to be vanishing at Tenneco itself. Netincome at the far-flung conglomerate, based in Houston,slumped 4% to $561 million, or $4.37 a share, last year, on a3% sales rise to $14.5 billion from the year-earlier level.Tenneco earnings may well slip again this year, primarilyreflecting more troubles for Case -- which seemed for a timeto be leading Tenneco toward better days.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It will be a difficult year,&quot; says James L. Ketelsen,Tenneco chairman and chief executive officer. Tenneco willtake a first-quarter charge of as much as $35 million foroverseas staff cuts at Case, Mr. Ketelsen said. Some analystsexpect Tenneco to post earnings for the quarter well belowthe year-earlier $134 million, or $1.03 a share, on revenueof $3.6 billion.   Tenneco was supposed to be performing better by now. Thatwas the promise it made with a drastic 1988 restructuringthat shed $7.6 billion in oil and gas properties to pay downdebt and concentrate on other operations. But Tenneco'sdisparate batch of remaining units keeps hitting snags.   For instance, Tenneco's shipbuilding operations, thenation's largest, could become a casualty of peace, feelingthe pinch of Pentagon budget cuts. Its packaging unit,chemicals and minerals operations and automotive partsbusiness are all at the mercy of a dismal U.S. economy.Natural gas pipeline volumes have been hurt by a successionof mild winters bringing low prices. And Case, the company'sbiggest and generally most problematic unit, has lostimportant leadership just ahead of more trying times.   Still, claims Mr. Ketelsen, &quot;We're not at all pessimisticor panicky.&quot;   Some investors, however, have been both during the pastyear. In New York Stock Exchange trading, Tenneco's stockprice has sunk as low as $40 a share from a 52-week high of$71. Tenneco closed Friday at $42.25, down 75 cents.   &quot;Wall Street has had a hate-hate relationship with JimKetelsen for several months,&quot; says David Fleischer, analystat Prudential Securities. &quot;We're sick of hearing about thegreat assets of Tenneco while performance continues to belackluster.&quot;   Of Tenneco's units, the one with the murkiest future --and the one that is most crucial to the parent -- is Case.The largest revenue producer, with 37% of Tenneco's total,Case accounts for a meager 14% of operating profit, making itproportionately the worst performer among Tenneco's six unitsin terms of profit contributions last year.   Mr. Ketelsen admits to having &quot;a lot of ego wrapped up&quot; inCase, where he became chairman in 1967 at age 37. When he ranCase in the 1960s, the company had about 12% of the farmequipment market, up against heavyweights Deere andamp; Co. andInternational Harvester Co.   In 1985, Case bought Harvester's farm-equipmentmanufacturing arm, boosting its market share to 36% andnarrowing the gap between it and No. 1 Deere, which now has41%, industry consultants say. But Case's performancelanguished after the acquisition, and the unit posted anoperating loss of $207 million for 1987.   Enter James Ashford in late 1987 on a Case turnaroundmission for Mr. Ketelsen. The marketing-oriented Mr. Ashford,who had run Tenneco's automotive division, moved Case in amore customer-driven direction. He installed a 150-seattheater at the main Racine plant, where prospective customerswatch slide shows about new products; he reduced operatingcosts by $150 million a year and introduced tractors withsuch options as compact disc players and radar that warns ofbumps and holes.   &quot;Under Ashford, Case went to market-driven products,rather than just building a new line and then trying to sellit,&quot; says John Stark, editor and publisher of a financialnewsletter on the farm and construction equipment industry.   The cultural transformation at Case has been startling,says Andre Cariello, general manager of the Racine tractorplant. &quot;Before, if a customer didn't like what you made,tough,&quot; he says.   One assembly worker, Lennie Juliano, has become soenthusiastic about welcoming farmers to the plant that hehands out business cards inviting them to phone him foradvice if their new tractors have maintenance problems. &quot;Itell them they can call me at home, too. Anything to keep thefarmers happy,&quot; he says.   The Ashford approach worked to the tune of a record $228million operating profit in 1989. Rumors grew that Mr.Ashford, now 54, had moved solidly into a position to succeedMr. Ketelsen, 60, as the head of Tenneco.   But then came 1990 and a softening in farm equipment salesat midyear. &quot;When the Iraqi thing happened, it slowed downeven more,&quot; says Mr. Ketelsen. He speculates that the salesdrop is more of a psychological reaction to factors such asthe Gulf war with Iraq than it is economicsdriven. &quot;Thepuzzling thing is that farm debt was down in 1990; {farm}land prices were up and many crop prices were, too,&quot; he says.   Case's operating profit fell to $186 million in 1990, andthe unit is expected to post a loss from operations for thefirst quarter. Farm equipment makers &quot;will be fortunate to doas well this year as last year,&quot; says Alan Barkema, senioreconomist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Heexpects farm income to fall 10% this year because ofinternational grain surpluses that will hurt prices on U.S.exports. &quot;Farmers will be reluctant to make big purchases,&quot;he says.   With bad news being reported and more approaching, Mr.Ashford on March 15 announced he plans to retire, citingpersonal reasons. He declines to comment further amidindustry speculation that Mr. Ketelsen may have blamed himfor Case's derailment and poked deeper into the unit'soperations and plans than Mr. Ashford would tolerate.   &quot;Jim Ashford was doing a good job here and was a strongcandidate to be my successor,&quot; Mr. Ketelsen says tersely.&quot;I'm disappointed. His leaving had nothing to do with thecompany or our relationship.&quot; He says he promised Mr. Ashfordhe wouldn't say more on the subject.   On the unit, Mr. Ketelsen, adds that &quot;Case is to beproven; it still hasn't achieved a satisfactory return.&quot;   Optimism abounds in the ranks, though. Darrell Gillespie,a Case dealer in Elbow Lake, Minn., says he sold two $80,000Case Magnum tractors last week. &quot;A good year for us is 15Magnums,&quot; he says.   On the Case assembly line in Racine, workers echo Mr.Gillespie's high hopes by posting a handmade sign reading:&quot;Nothing Kills a Deere Like a Magnum.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
