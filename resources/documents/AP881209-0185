(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The boy was up to no good and hisparents knew it.   He was staying out late and skipping school. Strangers werecoming up to his bedroom window at 2 a.m. But he swore he wasn'tdealing drugs. The parents needed proof to set him straight and theydidn't want him to get arrested.   They called in Corky, an eager yellow Labrador with a remarkablyeffective nose.   ``The dog found a quarter-ounce of coke in gram bags in a slitunder his rug,'' said Gene Panella, who trained 2-year-old Corky tolocate even minute amounts of marijuana, cocaine and heroin at $250a sniff.   Panella, owner of K9 of Broward, has found a lucrative new angleon South Florida's ever-present drug trade _ working for privatecitizens who want their property to be drug-free _ but has alsoraised the ire of civil libertarians.   ``In the past four months, he's been nearly every other day on asearch,'' said Panella, who claims Corky has found drugs in 32 of 33homes.   ``Families and corporations are mostly interested in getting helpfor people on drugs, rather than arresting them. All I'm doing isfinding the evidence to confront them with.''   Panella primarily breeds and trains guard dogs, but he decided tobranch out after boat owners began calling him for help from theU.S. Coast Guard's ``zero tolerance'' policy of confiscating boatsfound with minimal amounts of drugs on board.   One was the owner of the 135-foot luxury yacht Corky searched inFort Lauderdale.   ``When we got to the crew's quarters the dog just went bananas,''Panella said. ``The owner fired the crew on the spot. He justdropped them off on the dock.''   Panella says he warns business executives that one offender canleave drug residue all over an office. But he doesn't worry that thedog might also implicate drug-free employees during his searches.   ``I just tell them where it is. The rest is their problem.''   Private employees are not constitutionally protected from drugsearches of their workplaces, but the prospect is neverthelessdisturbing to civil libertarians.   ``It's funny to think of a dog as high-tech ... but it's clearthat this is a very highly invasive type of technology,'' said PaulJoseph, vice president of the American Civil Liberties Union inFlorida. ``Our society is going to have to decide whether that isacceptable.''   But Jack Hook of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officein Miami says Panella's services are sorely needed.   ``How else can you stop the lawyer who stops by his favoritecrack house on the way home?'' Hook said. ``I think it's neededbecause nothing has been done to stop the users.''   There are other businesses like Panella's around the country, but``there aren't very many of them, I'm sure,'' said Wayne Bohrer,deputy chief of the DEA's state and industry section in Washington.Panella said he had been contacted by someone in New York who wantedto start a drug-dog business.   Corky is so much in demand now that Panella is training a4-month-old beagle named Daffy to handle the overflow.   But dog owners daydreaming of making a fortune off Fido shouldknow that a good drug dog costs about $6,000 to train, and not alltypes are suited for the work, Panella said.   ``The biggest thing about training a drug dog is starting withthe right animal. You want the obnoxious, hyper, snotty types,'' hesaid. ``You want them to get keyed up.''   Panella has a special dispensation from the Drug EnforcementAdministration to keep the illegal drugs he needs to train his dogs.But the animals never get to eat the drugs that drive them crazy.   ``Everybody thinks the dogs are all junkies, but we never letthem touch the drugs,'' Panella said. ``I've seen dogs get stonedout, and they're never the same after that.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tues PMs, Dec. 13</NOTE></DOC>
