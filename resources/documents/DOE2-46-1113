This indicates the trends of energy supply/consumptionin Japan to shift to the electric power and urban gas. About 98% of consumersof urban gas are charged with new rate since the charge revision in 1988.The urban gas industry is making efforts to stabilize the charge forlong term by the effective management of business operation. The paperdescribes the cogeneration and the small gas engine heat pump for thedevelopment and promotion of gas utilization.
