<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-35-0902 </DOCNO><TEXT>The effects of a laser beam on the dielectronic recombination (DR) ofH-like ions with continuum electrons was investigated for a single-mode,circularly polarized laser with irradiance 10/sup 12/--10/sup 17/ W/cm{sup2} and photon energy 0.1--5.0 eV. Laser-induced increases in the valueof the DR rate coefficient, up to {similar_to}100 x , were found forrecombinations via the lowest-lying intermediate states, over a narrowrange of the ionic charge Z, centered near Z = 5. Within this range ofZ, the DR rate coefficient summed over all accessible intermediate stateswas increased by a factor of {similar_to}10 over its zero-field value.</TEXT></DOC>
