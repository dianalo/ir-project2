The Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee is expected to approve such legislation in the next few weeks. The concept also enjoys strong support in the House and among many economists and antitrust attorneys who have studied the industry.    Both the Justice Department and federal transportation officials endorsed the legislation yesterday during testimony before the panel. Subcommittee Chairman Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) said, &quot;We're prepared to move promptly on the matter.&quot;    Without additional legislation, the Department of Transportation will retain authority in this area until Jan. 1, 1989, when its power expires. Then, the Justice Department could challenge airline mergers under antitrust laws. Sen. Metzenbaum and other critics of the current arrangement want to complete the shift this year, and they want to give the Justice Department explicit authority to review those mergers.    Alfred Kahn, an early champion of airline deregulation and former chairman of the defunct Civil Aviation Board, told the subcommittee that he supported a rapid shift of antitrust authority to the Justice Department. &quot;It's obvious that's what should have been done in the first place,&quot; he asserted.    Mr. Kahn also criticized the Reagan administration for what he asserted were &quot;severe derelictions&quot; in enforcing federal antitrust laws with regard to airline mergers. The Department of Transportation, according to Mr. Kahn, has focused too much on &quot;potential entry of competitors&quot; into certain markets without giving adequate weight to signs that changes in economic and industry conditions have &quot;greatly diminished&quot; the probability of new competitors surfacing in many areas.    The legislation before the subcommittee isn't likely to be approved quickly enough to affect any major pending airline mergers, according to lawmakers and administration officials. But the changes could make it more difficult for carriers to combine operations in what some analysts predict may be a new round of industry consolidations by the early 1990s.    Justice Department officials use generally tougher antitrust standards than their Transportation Department counterparts to determine whether proposed airline mergers are anti-competitive. The Justice Department has recommended disapproval of three major mergers in the past two years, but all three proposals eventually received the green light from the transportation agency.    Matthew Scocozza, assistant transportation secretary for policy and international affairs, said the department supported the immediate &quot;sunset&quot; of its merger authority. Roger Andewelt, a deputy assistant attorney general, told the subcommittee, &quot;It is time to treat the airline industry in precisely the same way as other U.S. industries&quot; when analyzing merger proposals. </TEXT></DOC>
