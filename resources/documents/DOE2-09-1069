Thederivation of accurate gas adiabatic potential curves in the full distancerange requires calculations accounting not only for repulsive and overlapeffects that induce the characteristic excimer well depths, but alsofor the long-range forces, and especially for dispersion. Attention isgiven to experimental results furnishing useful tests for the theoreticalpotential curves in a large domain of internuclear distances. 61 references.</TEXT></DOC>
