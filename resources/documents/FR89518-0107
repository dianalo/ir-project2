The 1988 amendments authorize deposits in the Fund throughSeptember 30, 1994 and amended section 1402.In section 1402, the ceiling of the Fund was raised and the allocationmodified. The maximum amount which could be deposited in the Fund was raisedto $125 million for the Fiscal Years 1989-1991 and to $150 million forFiscal Years 1992-1994. Any excess of these amounts does not become partof the Fund.

Overview of the StatuteSection 1403(a)(1) of the Act provides that funds permitting, the Directorwill make an annual grant to an eligible crime victim compensation programin an amount equal to 40% of the amount paid from State funds by the programas compensation to victims of crime (excluding amounts paid to compensatevictims for property damage) during the preceding fiscal year. If the amountin the Fund is insufficient to award each State 40% of its prior year compensationpayouts, section 1403(a)(2) provides that all States will be awarded thesame reduced percentage of their prior year payouts out of available funds.For purposes of the victim compensation provisions of the Act, ``State''includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, andany other possession or territory of the United States. (Section 1403(4).)Section 1403 of the Act prescribes the conditions and eligibility criteriarelated to crime victim compensation grants.II. Program Requirements for Grants In order to be eligible for awards under the Act, a State must submit thefollowing information and assurances: (1) A statement certified by the chief executive of the State, State AttorneyGeneral, or the Secretary of State, of the total amount of payments madeto victims during the preceding fiscal year from State sources. (2) The amount of such compensation paid for ``property damage''; (3) The total amount and each source of revenue for the program; (4) A certified copy of the State statute or other legal authority establishingthe program. For the purpose of requirement (1), the amount to be certified is onlythe amount actually spent by the program to compensate victims of crime.Amounts expended for administration of the program or other types of victimassistance are to be excluded, as are amounts appropriated or collectedfor the purpose of victim compensation which were not expended. For the purpose of requirement (2), the term ``property damage'' is definedby the Act to exclude damage to eye-glasses, corrective lenses, dentaldevices, and prosthetic devices. Therefore, a State may include paymentsmade for damage to those devices in the amount reported under requirement(1) as compensation to victims of crime. Compensation paid to reimbursecrime victims for damages to, or loss of, any other real or personal propertymust be reported under requirement (2). For the purpose of requirement (4), certification may be effected by thechief executive, the State Attorney General, or the clerk of the Statelegislature. The requested information and assurances must be provided annually whenthe applicant State agency furnishes the Office for Victims of Crime withthe total amount of payments to victims of criminal violence for the yearrequested.III. State Grant Eligibility Requirements State crime victims compensation programs which apply for a grant underthe provisions of the Victims of Crime Act, as amended, must provide assurancesof compliance with the requirements of section 1403(b) of the Act and theseGuidelines. The definitions of terms used in section 1403(b) appear insection 1403(d): (New statutory language, from the 1988 amendments to theVictims of Crime Act, is italicized.)<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) the term ``property damage'' does not include damage to prostheticdevices, <T3>eyeglasses or other corrective lenses, </T3>or dental devices; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The term ``medical expenses'' includes, to the extent providedunder the eligible crime victim compensation program, expenses for <T3>eyeglasses and other corrective lenses, </T3>for dental services anddevices and prosthetic devices, and for services rendered in accordancewith a method of healing recognized by the law of the State; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) the term ``compensable crime'' means a crime the victims of whichare eligible for compensation under the eligible crime victim compensationprogram, and <T3>includes driving while intoxicated and domestic violence; </T3>and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) the term ``State'' includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealthof Puerto Rico, and any other possession or territory of the United States.</ITAG>A State crime victim compensation program is eligible for a grant uponproviding the necessary assurances, described in these guidelines, anddocumentation of compliance with the eight eligibility requirements insection 1403(b). The requirements are provided below with a discussionof each. New requirements, added by the 1988 amendments, are underlinedand must be met by October 1, 1990.<ITAG tagnum="84">Eligibility Requirements: </ITAG>1. Such program is operated by a State and offers compensation to victimsand survivors of victims of criminal violence, including drunk drivingand domestic violence for (A) Medical expenses attributable to a physical injury resulting from compensablecrime, including expenses for mental health counseling and care; (B) Loss of wages attributable to a physical injury resulting from a compensablecrime; and (C) Funeral expenses attributable to a death resulting from a compensablecrime. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The fundamental criterion of eligibility is an operationalState-administered crime victim compensation program. Although an authorizedprogram that has not actually paid out compensation benefits would be technicallyeligible under subsection 1403(b)(1), the program would not be entitledto any Federal funds because it had not awarded any benefits that the Federalgovernment could match under subsection 1403(a)(1). Federal funds may notbe used as ``start-up'' funds for a new State program.The 1988 amendments require, as a new condition of eligibility, effectiveOctober 1, 1990, that a State must specifically include two categoriesof crime victims to those eligible for crime victims compensation. Thesetwo categories are victims of drunk driving and domestic violence. Exclusionof victims in these two categories will not be allowable in FY 1991. Victimsof drunk driving and domestic violence, including spouse abuse, child abuse,and elder abuse, must be considered for crime victims compensation on thesame basis or criteria as other victims of criminal violence. Some States include the two categories of victims identified above as eligibleapplicants for compensation but within one or both of the categories theState statute provides specific exceptions, conditions, or limitationswhich serve to eliminate some victims of drunk driving and domestic violencefrom compensation awards. Some of the exceptions are indicated below: andbullet; Payments of some but not all compensable expenses available toother victims; andbullet; Denial of compensation to relatives of the perpetrator; andbullet; Denial of compensation to victims living with the perpetrator;andbullet; Requiring, in all drunk driving cases, that a conviction of theoffender precede the awarding of compensation. This short list is not exhaustive. It only serves to identify <T3>some</T3> of the exceptions. The exceptions, or any other specificexceptions, which have the effect of establishing a categorical exclusionfor the two types of victims specifically mentioned in the amendments (domesticviolence and drunk driving) will not be allowable effective October 1,1990. This does not mean that State discretion in determining whether to makean award, has been eliminated. It only means that a denial of compensationto any victim of drunk driving or domestic violence cannot be made solelyon the basis of the type of crime, the category of benefits requested,the living arrangement of the offender and victim, or the fact that victimand perpetrator are related.<ITAG tagnum="84">Domestic Violence </ITAG>In considering awards of compensation to victims of domestic violence,States should apply the same standards that are applied to claims fromvictims of other violent crimes, regardless of the familial relationshipof the offender and the victim or the fact that they share a residence.This means that the same level of benefits available to other victims shouldbe available to domestic violence victims, and that the same eligibilityrequirements, such as timely reporting and cooperation with law enforcement,shall apply. Subsection 1403(b)(7), another new provision of the Act effective October1, 1990, prohibits State programs from denying compensation because ofthe living arrangements of victim and perpetrator: ``Such program doesnot, except pursuant to rules issued by the program to prevent unjust enrichmentof the offender, deny compensation to any victim because of that victim'sfamilial relationship to the offender, or because of the sharing of a residencyby the victim and the offender; * * *'' This means that unjust enrichment,as the basis for denying crime victims compensation must be based uponwritten rules issued by the State crime victims compensation program. Suchrules cannot have the effect of denying most domestic violence victimsof compensation. The rules relating to unjust enrichment should be applicableto all claims for compensation although it is recognized that domesticviolence cases may have the greatest potential for unjust enrichment. In general, programs must balance the goals of making compensation benefitsavailable to domestic violence victims and preventing unjust enrichmentof offenders. State programs are strongly encouraged to work with domesticviolence coalitions and representatives to this end. In developing rules, the States should consider the following: A. Legal responsibilities of the offender to the victim under the lawsof the state, and collateral resources available to the victim from theoffender. For example, legal responsibilities may include court-orderedrestitution or requirements for spouse and/or family support under thedomestic or marital property laws of the State. Collateral resources mayinclude insurance or pension benefits available to the offender to coverthe costs incurred by the victim as a result of the crime. As with othercrimes, victims of domestic violence should not be penalized when collateralsources of payment are not viable. For example, when the offender refusesto or cannot pay restitution or other civil judgments within a reasonableperiod of time or when the offender otherwise impedes direct or third party(i.e. insurance) reimbursements.B. The extent to which the payment will substitute for money that the offenderotherwise normally would expend for the benefit of the household or itsmembers. Payments to victims of domestic violence which benefit offendersin only a minimal or inconsequential manner would not be considered unjustenrichment. To deny payments, in some instances, could serve to furthervictimize the claimant.  C. Consultation with social services and other concerned governmental entities,as well as with private organizations that support and advocate on behalfof domestic violence victims, is again encouraged.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drunk Driving </ITAG>Victims of drunk driving is the second category of victims specificallynamed in the 1988 amendment to section 1403(b)(1). Effective October 1,1990, State programs will be required to offer compensation to victimsand survivors of victims of ``drunk driving.'' Section 1403(d) defines the term ``compensable crime'' to include victimsof those ``driving while intoxicated.'' In these Guidelines, the Officefor Victims of Crime does not make a distinction between the terms ``drunkdriving'' and ``driving while intoxicated.'' By using both terms in theamendments to section 1403 of the Victims of Crime Act, Congress signaledits interest in the inclusion of victims of drunk driving and driving underthe influence of other intoxicants. States use these two terms, and others,in their statutes to denote offenses associated with the operation of amotor vehicle while chemically impaired. In addition, the specific classificationof offenses is contingent upon the results of appropriate tests to determineintoxication or the influence of drugs or alcohol. In FY 1991, States will be required to offer crime victims compensationto victims and survivors of victims of vehicular crashes attributable todrunk or intoxicated driving. Consistent with the practice of awardingcompensation to all other victims of criminal violence on the basis ofa law enforcement officer's investigation report establishing the commissionof a crime, victims of drunk driving crashes should be considered for compensationon the same basis. It is acknowledged that occasionally a police reportmay not be sufficient to establish that a crime took place. With drunkdriving cases, as with other cases, individual decisions will have to bemade on the basis of available documentation. 2. Such program promotes victim cooperation with the reasonable requestsof law enforcement authorities; <T3>Discussion:</T3> This criterion requires that a State program promotevictim cooperation with the reasonable requests of law enforcement authorities.The States may impose such reasonable requirements as they see fit, butmust, at a minimum, require a victim to report the crime to the appropriatecriminal justice agency and assist in the identification of the suspect.3. Such State certifies that grants received under this section will notbe used to supplant State funds otherwise available to provide crime victimcompensation; <T3>Discussion:</T3> The Act prohibits States from using the Federal fundsmade available under the Act to supplant State funds otherwise availablefor crime victim compensation. Section 1403(b)(3). The nonsupplantation provision is fundamentally intended to assure thatthe States use the Federal funds provided under the Act to augment, notreplace, otherwise available State funding for victim compensation. Morespecifically, the States may not decrease their financial commitment tocrime victim compensation solely because they are receiving Federal fundsfor the same purpose. 4. Such program, as to compensable crimes occurring within the State, makescompensation awards to victims who are nonresidents of the State on thebasis of the same criteria used to make awards to victims who are residentsof such State; <T3>Discussion:</T3> This provision is intended to assure that nonresidentsof a State who are victimized in a State that has an eligible compensationprogram are provided the opportunity to apply for and receive the samecompensation benefits that are available to residents of the State. Themaintenance of reciprocal agreements with certain other States, or foreigncompensation programs will not suffice to meet this criterion. Eligibiltyfor Federal funding will require the program to extend its coverage toall nonresidents victimized in the State. 5. Such program provides compensation to victims of Federal crimes occurringwithin the State on the same basis that such program provides compensationto victims of State crimes;                <T3>Discussion: </T3>This does not constitute a new eligibility requirement,rather it is a rewording of the requirement in a clearer more concise manner.States must compensate victims of Federal crimes occurring within the Stateon the same basis that such program provides compensation to victims ofState crimes. For example, a victim of a rape occurring on a Federal installationor Indian reservation inside the State must be afforded the same benefitsthat would be available to the victim if the rape were committed elsewherein the State. 6. Such program provides compensation to residents of the State who arevictims of crimes occurring outside the State if_ (A) The crimes would be compensable crimes had they occurred inside thatState; and(B) The places the crimes occurred in are States not having eligible crimevictim compensation programs; <T3>Discussion: </T3>This requirement protects residents of a State, withan eligible crime victims compensation program, who are victims of criminalviolence in another State which does not have an eligible crime victimsprogram. In such instances, the victim would be eligible for crime victimscompensation from the State in which he/she resides effective October 1,1990. If a person from one State is victimized in another which has aneligible compensation program, the State in which the crime was committedwould offer compensation to the victim as provided in 4 above. 7. Such program does not, except pursuant to rules issued by the programto prevent unjust enrichment of the offender, deny compensation to anyvictim because that victim's familial relationship to the offender, orbecause of the sharing of a residence by the victim and the offender; and<T3>Discussion: </T3>Effective October 1, 1990, unjust enrichment as thebasis for denying crime victims compensation by a State must be based uponwritten rules issued by the State crime victims compensation program. Suchrules cannot have the effect of denying most domestic violence victimsof compensation. A full discussion of this requirement was included inthe discussion of 1 above. 8. Such program provides such other information and assurances relatedto the purposes of this section as the Director may reasonably require.<T3>Discussion: </T3>States receiving crime victims compensation grantsare required to prepare annual performance reports on the form providedby the Office of Victims of Crime. The performance report covers the Federalfiscal year ending September 30 and is due in the Office for Victims ofCrime by December 30. Data furnished by the States contributes necessaryinformation for the preparation of the report to the President and theCongress due in December 1990 and on December 31 every two years thereafter.Information about State crime victims compensation programs and the eligibilityof victims of Federal crimes for State compensation awards is not wellknown on Indian reservations in many States. Because of this situation,the Office for Victims of Crime is proposing, as a new condition of eligibilityfor a crime victims compensation grant, that States initiate efforts toinform those on Indian reservations about the State crime compensationprogram and the availability of compensation to all victims of violentState or Federal crimes regardless of where in the State such crime wascommitted. States will be asked to describe these efforts in their applicationsfor Fiscal Year 1990 funding. IV. Financial Requirements <ITAG tagnum="84">A. Payment of Grant Funds </ITAG>1. <T3>Annual Requirement Under $120,000. </T3>Grantees whose annual fundrequirement is less than $120,000 will receive Federal funds on a ``CheckIssued'' basis. Upon receipt, review and approval of a REQUEST FOR ADVANCEOR REIMBURSEMENT, H-3 Report (OJP, Form 7160/3) by the grantor agency,a voucher and a schedule for payment is prepared for the amount approved.This schedule is forwarded to the U.S. Treasury requesting issuance andmailing of the check directly to the grantee or its designated fiscal agent.A request must be limited to the grantee's immediate cash needs and submittedat least monthly. 2. <T3>Annual Requirement Over $120,000. </T3>Grantees whose annual fund requirementexceeds $120,000 generally receive Federal funds by utilizing the ``Letterof Credit'' procedures. This funding method is a cash management processprescribed by the U.S. Treasury for all major grant-in-aid recipients.3. <T3>Check Issuance. </T3>All checks drawn for the payment of fund requests,either under the ``Check Issued'' or the ``Letter of Credit'' process,are prepared and disbursed by the U.S. Treasury and <T3>not </T3>by the grantor agency. 4. <T3>Termination of Advance Funding. </T3>If a grantee organization receivingcash advances by letter of credit or by direct Treasury check demonstratesan unwillingness or inability to establish procedures that will minimizethe time elapsing between cash advances and disbursement, the grantor agencymay terminate advance funding and require the grantee organization to financeits operations with its own working capital. Payments to grantee will thenbe made by the direct Treasury check method to reimburse the grantee foractual cash disbursements. It is essential that the grantee organizationmaintain a minimal amount of cash on hand and that drawdowns of cash aremade only when necessary for disbursements.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Cost Allowability </ITAG>Allowable costs for crime victims compensation are:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Medical expenses attributable to a physical injury resulting fromcompensable crime, including expenses for mental health counseling andcare; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Loss of wages attributable to a physical injury resulting froma compensable crime; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Funeral expenses attributable to a death resulting from a compensablecrime.</ITAG>Amount expended for administration of the program (including the performanceof audits are not allowable costs. States are encouraged, but not required, to provide emergency awards, forallowable costs, when immediate services or assistance are necessary forthe victim's health or welfare. A number of States now provide for emergencyawards. <T3>Audit costs: </T3>Although under OMB Circular A-128 audit costs aregenerally allowable charges under Federal grants, audit cost incurred atthe grantee (State) level are determined to be an administrative expenseand, therefore, cannot be paid for with crime victim compensation grantfunds. c. <T3>Audit Responsibilities. </T3>Pursuant to the Office of Management andBudget (OMB) Circular A-128, ``Audits of State and Local Governments,''grantees, subgrantees, and subrecipients have the responsibility to providefor an audit of their activities. These audits shall be made annually,unless the State or local government has, by January 1, 1987, a constitutionalor statutory requirement for less frequent audits. Note: Institutions ofhigher education, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations have theresponsibility to provide for an audit of their activities not less thanevery two years. While governments (state and local) receiving less than$25,000 in any fiscal year are exempt from a single audit, there is noaudit exclusion for private nonprofit organizations. However, where stateand local governments and nonprofit organizations receive grants or otheragreements less than $100,000 and do not obtain audits that meet the requirementsof OMB Circulars A-110 and A-128, DOJ grantor organizations shall ensurethat Federal funds are spent in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.Techniques to use to determine recipient compliance with Federal requirementsare: 1. Recipient obtained audits made in accordance with the Standards forAudit of Governmental Organizations, Programs, Activities, and Functionsissued by the Comptroller General; 2. Previous audits performed on recipients' operations; 3. Desk reviews by program officials of project documentation; 4. Project audits by Federal auditors or auditors obtained by recipients;5. Evaluations of recipients' operations by program officials. These audits shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance withgenerally accepted government auditing standards governing financial andcompliance audits. The required audits are to be performed on an organization-widebasis as opposed to a grant-by-grant basis. The audit reports must include:1. The auditor's report on financial statements of the recipient organizationand a schedule of financial assistance showing the total expenditure foreach Federal assistance program; 2. The auditor's report on compliance containing: (a) A statement of positive assurance with respect to those items testedfor compliance, including compliance with law and regulations pertainingto financial reports and claims for advances and reimbursements; (b) A negative assurance of those items not tested and a summary of allinstances of noncompliance; and (c) The auditor's report on the study and evaluation of internal controlsystems, which must identify the organization's significant internal accountingcontrols designed to provide reasonable assurance that Federal programsare being managed in compliance with applicable laws and regulation. Itmust also identify the controls that were evaluated, the controls thatwere not evaluated, and the material weaknesses identified as a resultof that evaluation. D. <T3>Audit Objectives. </T3>Grants and other agreements are awarded subjectto conditions of fiscal, program and general administration to which therecipient expressly agrees. Accordingly, the audit objective is to reviewthe recipient's administration of grant funds and required non-Federalcontributions for the purpose of determining whether the recipient has:1. Financial statements of the government, department, agency, or establishmentthat present fairly its financial position and the results of its financialoperations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;2. The organization has internal accounting and other control systems toprovide reasonable assurance that it is managing Federal financial assistanceprograms in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; and 3. The organization has complied with laws and regulations that may havematerial effect on its financial statements and on each Federal assistanceprogram. E. <T3>Audit Implementation. </T3>Grantees are required to specify their arrangementfor complying with the provisions of OMB Circular A-128 and include intheir grant application, to the extent possible, the following information:1. The identity of the organization that will conduct the audit; 2. Approximate timing of when the audit will be performed; 3. Audit coverage to be provided. Where the audit will not provide thecoverage requirements as specified previously, the audit policy or proceduresmust describe the specific arrangements for obtaining audit services thatwill meet the requirements; 4. An identification of the audit standards, if any, with which the granteewill not comply;5. Receipt and appropriate distribution of the resultant audit report;and 6. Audit resolution policies and procedures to be followed in resolvingthe audit report.F. <T3>Fund Suspension or Termination. </T3>If, after notice and opportunityfor a hearing, the Office for Victims of Crime, Office of Justice Programsfinds that a State has failed to substantially comply with the Victimsof Crime Act, The Financial and Administrative Guide for Grants (OJP M7100.1), these proposed implementing Guidelines, or any implementing regulation,the Office for Victims of Crime, Office of Justice Programs may suspendor terminate funding to the State, or take other appropriate action.G. <T3>Grant Application.</T3> The Office for Victims of Crime prepares anddistributes an annual Program Instruction for crime victims compensationgrants. The Program Instruction, which is sent to all State compensationprogram eligible to apply for a grant, provides the necessary informationand guidance for the preparation and submission of an application for agrant award. Enclosed with the Program Instruction is an application kitcontaining the necessary application materials and instructions for thesubmission of the required assurances.V. Additional Requirements<ITAG tagnum="84">A. Civil Rights</ITAG>1. <T3>General.</T3> The Act provides that no person shall be excluded fromparticipation in, denied the benefits of, subjected to discrimination under,or denied employment in connection with any activity receiving funds underthe Act on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, handicap,or sex. (See section 1407(e) of the Act.) Recipients of funds under theAct are also subject to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.2000d (prohibiting discrimination in federally-funded programs on the basisof race, color, or national origin), section 504 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973, 2 U.S.C. 794 (prohibiting discrimination in such programson the basis of handicap), the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C.6101, <T3>et seq</T3>., and the Department of Justice Nondiscrimination Regulations,28 CFR Part 42, Subparts, C, D, and G.2. <T3>Required Assurances and Information</T3>. To be eligible for fundingunder the Act, a crime victim compensation program must submit the followingassurances and information:a. An assurance that the program will comply with all applicable nondiscriminationrequirements;b. An assurance that in the event a Federal or state court or Federal orstate administrative agency makes a finding of discrimination after a dueprocess hearing, on the grounds of race, color, religion, national origin,sex, age or handicap against the program, the program will forward a copyof the finding to the Office of Justice Programs, Office for Civil Rights(OCR);c. The name of the civil rights contact person who has lead responsibilityin ensuring that all applicable civil rights requirements are met and whoshall act as liaison in civil rights matters with OCR;d. An assurance that programs will maintain information on victim servicesprovided by race, national origin, sex, age and handicap.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> States are not required to submit this information as partof their program performance report.</ITAG>B. <T3>Confidentiality of Research Information.</T3> No recipient of moniesunder the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, as amended, shall use or revealany research or statistical information furnished under this program byany person and identifiable to any specific private person for any purposeother than the purpose for which such information was obtained in accordancewith this program and Act. Such information shall be immune from legalprocess and shall not, without the consent of the person furnishing suchinformation, be admitted as evidence or used for any purpose in any action,suit, or other judicial, legislative, or administrative proceeding. (SeeSection 1407(d) of the Act.)
