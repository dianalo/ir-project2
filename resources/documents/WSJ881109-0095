A group of scientists at Michigan State University found that microorganisms from the bed of New York's Hudson River break down most PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, even in the absence of oxygen. Previously, only less toxic kinds of PCBs were believed vulnerable to certain microbes, and only with oxygen present. Thus, biological treatment held little promise, especially for PCBs on lake and river bottoms.    &quot;It's a totally new discovery, and it should be taken into account before deciding what we do with the PCBs,&quot; said John F. Quensen, one of the researchers. The group published its findings in the latest issue of the journal Science.    PCBs, compounds once widely used as electrical insulation, were banned in 1977 after they were discovered to cause liver damage and cancer. By then, huge quantities had seeped into U.S. waterways. Current technology for destroying them involves incineration or chemical processes, both of which have severe limitations.    PCBs are difficult to break down because of their highly stable molecular structure, which consists of two conjoined hexagonal rings made up of varying numbers of chlorine atoms; the number determines the degree of stability and toxicity. Many chemists have tried unsuccessfully to &quot;dechlorinate&quot; PCBs chemically. But in one successful attempt, scientists at Texas Aandamp;M University reported some months ago that PCBs can be made to react with a &quot;super-energized&quot; oxygen atom that has received an extra electron.    Donald Sawyer, a Texas Aandamp;M researcher who is commercializing the chemical process, said the Michigan State finding was &quot;an impressive advance in our understanding of anaerobic microorganisms,&quot; those that live in the absence of oxygen. But he doubted the commercial potential of microbial treatment of PCBs. &quot;Microorganisms are fickle; they change their minds a lot and can mutate,&quot; he said. He also cited the general public and regulatory concerns about the use of specialized microbes in the environment.    But Mr. Quensen said the biological treatment would be less costly and more effective than chemical methods. He acknowledged, however, that it's &quot;too early&quot; to tell about the commercial potential of the findings. &quot;The important thing is that this is the first time we have found such microorganisms,&quot; he said.    Mr. Quensen said that in experiments conducted with a batch of microbes from the river bed, he and his colleagues found that the organisms in a 16-week period broke down half of the chlorine atoms in the type of PCBs released in the river. The experiments apparently confirm General Electric Co.'s claim last year that PCBs in the Hudson are being biologically broken down, a claim that scientists then doubted. GE has been blamed for discharging PCBs from its plants into the river.    Mr. Quensen said the group's next task is to identify and isolate the bacteria and develop &quot;optimum&quot; conditions under which the organisms will break down the PCBs to harmless components. Mr. Quensen said the problem is that these microorganisms prefer to dine on only the most toxic PCBs and only when they are present in large amounts. Hence different microbes will be required to clean up the table scraps and also to consume other kinds of PCBs with fewer chlorine atoms. </TEXT></DOC>
