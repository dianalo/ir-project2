North ``placed himself above thelaw'' by lying to Congress and shredding documents to conceal hissupport of the Nicaraguan rebels, a prosecutor told jurors today atthe opening of the former presidential aide's Iran-Contra trial.   Associate independent counsel John W. Keker said North's lies tocongressional committees and to the attorney general amount to ``acrime that goes to the soul of our self-government.''   But North's lawyer, Brendan Sullivan, countered that ``thedefense says to you, he is not guilty on all charges. He never brokethe law ... he followed instructions of higher authority.''   Keker, then Sullivan, delivered their opening statements, eachdescribing a different North, the first person to go on trial in theIran-Contra affair.   ``He was doing his job as he understood it; he was doing his dutyas he understood it,'' Sullivan said. ``If he didn't, then therecould be death resulting to the people he worked with and dangersresulting to the United States.''   ``The need for secrecy is no excuse for lying to Congress,''Keker told the jury. ``Lying to Congress is a crime.''   ``You don't have to be a political scientist to understand whythat's so,'' Keker said. ``Congress enacts the law, the presidentapproves it and enforces it. If they start lying to eachother oursystem of government is not going to work.''   A year after it passed the 1984 Boland Amendment banning U.S.military assistance to the Nicaraguan Contras, Congress receivednews reports that North, then a Marine lieutenant colonel, wassecretly raising money for the rebels from foreign countries andprivate donors and providing tactical military advice.   North and his boss at the time, national security adviser RobertMcFarlane, ``decided they didn't want Congress to know what ColonelNorth had been doing. They decided they would not tell Congress,''Keker said. ``They decided they would place themselves above the lawand not tell Congress about Colonel North's activities.''   Similar inquiries a year later were met with false answers fromNorth, including a meeting with the House Intelligence Committee atthe White House when the National Security Council aide ``lookedthem right in the eye and he lied,'' Keker said.   He said North pocketed some of the travelers checks a Contraleader gave to him to cover expenses incurred helping the rebels.   ``Colonel North used that $4,000 like it was his personal piggybank'' to buy groceries, tires and take his family on a trip,''Keker said.   North also accepted installation of a security fence around hisGreat Falls, Va., house from arms dealer Richard V. Secord, who hadhelped sell U.S. arms to Iran and divert $15 million in profits tobuy weapons for the Contras, the prosecutor said.   The arms-for-hostages deals with Iran were kept secret fromCongress until October 1986, when ``the roof caved in on this houseof cards'' with public disclosures about the Iran-Contra affair, hesaid.   When North went to his office on Nov. 21, 1986, ``the first thinghe did was take some of the records and change them to make it looklike what he had been doing he hadn't been doing for the last twoyears,'' Keker said.   ``He wanted to hide that he had already twice lied to theCongress of the United States,'' Keker said, and also wanted to hidethat he and others ``had diverted money from the Iranian arms salesto help the Contras.''   ``He went into his office and began to change the records, shredthe records, destroy the records,'' Keker told jurors. Two dayslater, when he lied to then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III, ``hehad placed himself above the law again.''   North sat raptly at attention as Keker spoke, occasionally takingnotes.   North's wife, Betsy, was escorted to her seat in the packedcourtroom by security guards midway through Keker's openingstatement.   Some 100 lawyers, reporters and members of the public beganlining up outside the courtroom for opening arguments in thelong-awaited trial.   The crush of spectators prompted court officials to announce thatonly 15 seats would be set aside for the public, including someaides to independant counsel Lawrence Walsh who were hoping toobserve the proceedings from the audience.   The defense contends that Reagan was personally involved inoffering inducements to third countries to support the Contrasopposing the leftist government in Nicaragua, and that Reagan and ahandful of top administration officials then directed a cover-up ofthe arrangement.   If North hid the arrangement from Congress, Sullivan suggested incourt filings last week, it was because he was directed to do so bythe president and his aides.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell has spent much of the 11months since North was indicted wrestling with problems stemmingfrom balancing the use of classified material against North's rightto a fair defense.   National security concerns by the Reagan administration led tothe dropping of the two central charges against North. The trial wasdelayed last week due to fears by U.S. intelligence agencies thatNorth would be allowed to spill out in the courtroom a mass ofclassified material damaging to the national security.   In a tartly worded opinion issued in December, Gesell accused thedefense of trying to force disclosure of irrelevant but sensitiveclassified information to scuttle the case.   The judge rejected a Justice Department request for morestringent controls over state secrets that North wants to present inhis defense. The next day, as a jury was being chosen, AttorneyGeneral Dick Thornburgh launched efforts to get the trial delayed,setting off a complex fight with independent counsel Walsh, whowanted the case to go forward immediately.   Thornburgh got the assurances he was seeking last Wednesday and aSupreme Court stay that had delayed the trial was lifted.   Through it all, the jury selected in the case waited to be calledby Gesell.   The nine women and three men jurors chosen Feb. 9 have one thingin common: They had almost no exposure to North's nationallytelevised congressional testimony in 1987 in which he admitted,under limited immunity from prosecution, many details touching onthe events that led to the criminal charges against him.   The jurors include an electronics technician, a cashier, a clerktypist at the Labor Department, a clerical worker who says ``I don'tlike the news'' and an unemployed former office manager who says sherecalled that North was ``selling something to Iran.''   North faces 12 criminal charges. Indicted last March, he is thefirst figure in the Iran-Contra affair to come to trial. He couldface up to 60 years in prison and $3 million in fines if convictedon all counts.   Former national security adviser John Poindexter and armssupplier Albert Hakim also face criminal charges in the case, but,along with Secord, are to be tried separately later.   Gesell dismissed two central charges against North on Jan. 13 _conspiracy and theft counts that accused North of diverting morethan $14 million in U.S. Iran arms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguanrebels.   U.S. intelligence agencies feared damage to national security andas a result Walsh asked to have those two counts thrown out.</TEXT></DOC>
