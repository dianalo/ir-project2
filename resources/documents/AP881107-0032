Col. Jean-Claude Paul, who was forcibly retired Sept. 30 ascommander of the Dessalines Battalion, died about 3 p.m. Sunday of aheart attack in his home in suburban Fermathe, Radio Haiti-Intersaid. He was 49.   The independent station gave no other details, but a familyfriend said there was speculation the 29-year army veteran waspoisoned.   Paul's maid and gardener were detained by police for questioning,said the family friend, who would not be identified further.   In addition, the colonel's former wife, Mireille Delinois, wastaken to the Petionville police station for protection because offear of reprisals by Paul's relatives, the friend said.   The military government's spokesman, Frantz Lubin, said he had noinformation on Paul's death. U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Cludealso said she had nothing.   Paul was stripped of his command after a Sept. 17 revolt bynoncommissioned officers ousted Haiti's military leader, Lt. Gen.Henri Namphy.   The coup leaders, who said they were outraged by state-sponsoredmurder under Namphy, replaced him with Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril andousted about 60 of the army's most repressive commanders.   Paul at first appeared allied with Avril, but the new leaderreportedly became concerned Paul might turn against him. Last month,Avril said he planned to close the barracks of the 700-manDessalines Battalion, the most brutal unit in Haiti's 7,000-memberarmy.   The unit has been linked to the Tonton Macoutes, the hatedprivate army of the 29-year Duvalier family dictatorship, and someof its members have been blamed for widespread violence that hasthwarted moves toward democratization promised after a popularuprising drove Jean-Claude Duvalier into exile in February 1986.   The violence included attacks on polling stations that forced thecancellation of independently run general elections last November,leaving at least 34 people dead.   Paul had been a powerful force in the army, which has run thisimpoverished Caribbean nation for most of its 144 years. Thebarracks of his former command are adjacent the presidential palace.   In March, Paul was indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami oncharges of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States.   The soldiers who ousted Namphy said they wanted to name him armychief but decided not to because of the drug charges.   Haitian and diplomatic sources later said Paul's retirement couldhelp lead to the renewal of a $70 million annual aid package theUnited States cut off after the November 1987 election massacre.   The drug trafficking indictment alleges Paul conspired to import220 pounds of cocaine into the United States in December 1986. Itsays the traffickers used a landing strip on Paul's farm 90 milesoutside Port-au-Prince, the capital, to load and fly the shipment tothe Bahamas.   Fritz Pierre-Louis, a former lieutenant in the Haitian army wholater defected, told Sens. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Bob Graham,D-Fla. in a special U.S. Senate hearing that 70 percent of Paul'stroops were involved in drug trafficking.   Namphy led a military junta that assumed power when Jean-ClaudeDuvalier fled into exile in France.   An attempt to dismiss Paul in June failed and led to the fall ofthe civilian government of Leslie F. Manigat, who had wonmilitary-run presidential elections in January.   Namphy had tried to reassign Paul to an administrative post, butPaul refused and was backed by Manigat. Namphy ousted Manigat onJune 20, accusing him of meddling in army affairs, and Paul remainedhead of his battalion.   Paul did not intervene when soldiers overthrew Namphy inSeptember.   The soldiers who formed Haiti's new government have said theywant to end random, state-sponsored violence and institutedemocratic reforms, but the government has set no dates forelections.</TEXT></DOC>
