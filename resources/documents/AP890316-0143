(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists at the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration have completed a study of world rainfallover the last century, creating a new standard by which to measurethe greenhouse effect.   ``What this gives us is a baseline,'' said Maurice Blackmon, NOAAclimatological research director, of the five-year study scheduledfor release Friday.   ``If you've got some major deviation, bigger than anything elsethat has been observed, you'd have to start looking for some newkind of variable ... such as the greenhouse effect.''   The study shows that precipitation has decreased over parts ofthe Northern Hemisphere and increased in the Southern Hemisphereover the past century.   Rainfall in Northern Hemisphere areas south of 30 degreeslatitude _ regions such as Mexico, Central America anddrought-ridden North Africa _ decreased by about 20 percent, thestudy found. Rainfall in the Southern Hemisphere rose about 5percent.   The findings are consistent with theories of the greenhouseeffect, a suspected global warming due to a steady buildup, of about4 percent a year, of carbon dioxide, methane and other ``greenhousegases'' since the era of heavy industry began.   The study predicts temperature increases of up to 5 degrees andfluctuations in rainfall near the equator over the next 50 years.   But atmospheric scientists emphasized that rainfall trendsobserved in the study don't prove the greenhouse effect is at work.   Global environmental changes ``can only be measured over a periodof years,'' said Henry Diaz, who studied records from more than2,000 weather stations. ``We cannot tell whether the climate ischanging by looking at the weather each year. To detect change inclimate, you need many decades.''   Blackmon said it was possible that fluctuations over the lastcentury were ``due to a recurring kind of anomaly not related to thegreenhouse effect.''   But he added, ``If it (the warming) lasts another ten years, itwould be unprecedented.''   In 10 years, ``unfortunately it will be too late to do much aboutthe problem,'' said Michael Schlesinger, the Oregon State Universityatmospheric scientist who developed a model for predicting effectsof global warming.</TEXT></DOC>
