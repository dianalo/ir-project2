Arnold, chief of reutilization and marketing at DLA'sTechnology and Logistics Services Directorate, said DAISY will cost about $93million to develop and maintain.andP;  The system will save about $400 millionover seven years, he said.andM;The system, which is being developed in-house, will have five increments.andO;The first two, the warehouse increment and the returns, transfers anddonations increment, will be deployed sometime next year, Parsons said.andM;The warehouse increment will provide a warehousing system to help DLA keeptrack of inventory it receives, stores and issues.andP;  The returns, transfersand donations increment will parcel out unused property, first making itavailable for use by the military services or other Defense organizations.andO;The DLA then offers the equipment to other agencies, state or foreigngovernments, philanthropic organizations and schools.andM;The third increment will provide a marketing system for DRMS to sell usedequipment to the general public.andM;DLA officials have said the last two increments will track hazardous wastefrom the time a contractor picks it up until disposal.andM;At the local level, DRMS will deploy 1,170 Zenith Data Systems Z-248microcomputers at DLA field offices.andP;  The micros will be linked to Gould Inc.andO;9050 or NP1 minicomputers at five regional DLA offices in Ogden, Utah;Memphis, Tenn.; Columbus, Ohio; Weisbaden, West Germany; and Pearl Harbor,Hawaii.andM;The upgrade is expected to be finished by 1992, Parsons said.andM;DLA also expects to continue upgrades of two systems this year for theDefense Logistics Service Center (DLSC) in Battle Creek, Mich.andP;  Last yearGrumman Data Systems won a $60 million contract to modernize the DefenseIntegrated Data System (DIDS) and the Military Engineering Data Asset LocatorSystem.andM;The DIDS is the data management system for the Federal Catalog System, whichcontains information on the procurement, storage and issuing of supplies.andM;DLSC is the central cataloging activity for the government and supports30,000 customers.andP;  The 12-year contract could be worth $143 million over thesystem's life cycle.andM;DLA also plans to complete this year the upgrade of the configurationplatform for its Standard Automated Materiel Management System (SAMMS)Immediate Improvement Initiative and deploy it at one of the Defense SupplyCenters running SAMMS.andM;Last year National Capitol Systems Inc. of Falls Church, Va.andP;  received afive-year, $103 million contract to develop and deploy two SAMMS subsystems.andO;SAMMS is the uniform ADP system used in five of DLA's six supply centers buyand manage DLA's inventory of clothing, medical and hardware items suppliedto the military.andM;The system supports all military services, including 15,000 users within DLA.andO;SAMMS is under the DLA Systems Automation Center and the DLA ConstructionSupply Center in Columbus.andM;The SAMMS improvements will include upgrading a prototype database platformto a production-grade system enabling multiple users to access the system.andO;DLA's information technology plan for 1990 said $33.2 million was earmarkedto deploy the production technology base at the four remaining centersbeginning in December.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
