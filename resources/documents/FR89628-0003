Although the regulationwas published in final form with an effective date 90 days after publication(July 6), the FDIC requested comments on several points for a 60-day period(until June 6). Comment was specifically invited on the concept of the``initial deposit'' as a means of measuring retail deposit activity (andSection;346.6), on the exemptions from the deposit insurance requirement (andSection;346.6(a)), and on the application of the waiver of offset to notes includedby regulation within the term deposit (see andSection; 346.19(d)(1)). Eleven comments were received; and one of these comments concerned a matternot at issue, the denomination in U.S. dollars of assets pledged to theFDIC. The overwhelming majority of the comments related to the exemptionsfrom deposit insurance, specifically to the deletion of the exemption currentlyembodied at andSection; 346.6(a)(7). These comments argued that the exemptionfor initial deposits of a depositor who is neither a U.S. citizen nor residentat the time of the initial deposit should be retained, primarily becausebranches rely heavily on the exemption and its elimination would requiresubstantial costs either to remain uninsured or to obtain insurance. Someargued that the International Banking Act was intended to cover only domesticdeposits, the implication being that these deposits are not domestic, andthat other entities accept such deposits without having to obtain depositinsurance. Commenters also maintained that the exemption has worked wellas it currently exists and that the volume of these deposits is in excessof the ``catchall'' de minimis exemption, even at the 5% level includedin the final regulation. After considering all of the comments, the FDIC has decided to retain boththe 5% de minimis provision (andSection; 346.6(a)(5)) and the current ``noncitizen,nonresident'' exemption (current andSection; 346.6(a)(7), adopted here asandSection; 346.6(a)(6)). (Although one comment related to computation ofthe de minimis provision using a base other than deposits, we believe thatthe basis for computation should be ``deposits'' pursuant to the definitionin the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.) Although deposits of persons whoremain noncitizens and nonresidents after the initial deposit are not domesticdeposits and are not covered by the IBA, the FDIC does have concerns aboutdepositors who become domestic depositors by either residence or citizenshipin the United States. In this vein, it is crucial that proper notificationof uninsured status be given to depositors. Each uninsured branch shouldverify that it is in compliance with andSection; 346.7, which requires suchnotification. If a branch is not in compliance, that branch should notifythe FDIC's Office of Analysis and Special Activities, Division of BankSupervision, 550 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20429, to determine whatsteps should be taken to attain compliance. In addition, it is recommendedthat uninsured branches consider notifying each depositor periodically(perhaps annually) of the uninsured status of the branch's deposits.Comment also was sought on the use of the ``initial deposit'' as the toolfor measuring retail activity. Two comments argued that the initial depositdoes not reflect the true nature of the activity as retail or wholesale.Another comment believed the tool is acceptable. The FDIC continues tohave concerns but believes that changes would require long-term study,so changes will not be made at this time. We continue to believe that manybranches are not adequately monitoring initial deposits, and branches areonce again cautioned to maintain records of initial deposits for the purposesof complying with this regulation. The FDIC's proposed regulation on the extension of deposit liabilitieshas not been finalized, and the FDIC has decided to defer the questionof the application of the waiver of offset to notes included as deposits.Only one comment referred to this matter, and it opposed the applicationof the waiver of offset. This amendment will become effective on July 6, at the time the previouslypublished regulation becomes effective. The amendment is restoring an exemption,so no delayed effective date is necessary. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>As stated in the final rule published on April 7, 1989 and in the proposedrule, the Board of Directors certified that the rule would not, if promulgated,have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitieswithin the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). There are presently 24 foreign banks which have insuredbranches, and they are world-wide institutions with assets ranging fromapproximately $2 to $240 billion. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requirementof 5 U.S.C. 604 that a final regulatory flexibility analysis be prepareddoes not apply.  In addition, pursuant to the FDIC's statement of policy on the draftingof regulations, it has been determined that a cost-benefit analysis, includinga small bank impact statement, is not required. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 346 </ITAG>Bank deposit insurance, Foreign banks, banking, Banks, banking, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements.
