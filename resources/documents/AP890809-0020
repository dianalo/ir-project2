The board Tuesday sent a report on school bus safety back to itsstaff for revisions after failing to resolve issues involving theuse of seat belts and the design of front-seat barriers in busesthat carry 10 to 24 passengers.   The staff wanted to conduct crash tests, but the four boardmembers at the meeting refused to adopt that recommendation.   Acting chairman James Kolstad said the small number offatalities in small school buses _ an average of two or three ayear with 41,000 buses on the road _ didn't justify the testing.   ``I think the parents of this country can be reassured thattheir children are by and large safe on these small school buses,''Kolstad said after the board spent three hours discussing theproposals it eventually declined to adopt.   The recommendations, drawn from a study of 24 bus crashes,called for tougher rollover standards, improved joint design, moresecure door latches and strengthened windshields.   Suzanne Stack, NTSB safety specialist, said federal standardsfor seat spacing, barrier padding and other safety featuresrequired for large buses don't apply to the smallest school buses.Use of the small buses has increased in urban areas, where theyoften serve handicapped or specialized students, she said.   Kolstad said he hopes to call another board meeting within a fewweeks to adopt the report and resolve the issues of front-seatbarriers and lap belts.   Kolstad characterized all the safety recommendations as``relatively minor'' and said school buses remain one of the safestforms of transportation. Large buses are somewhat safer than smallones, he said.   The report follows an NTSB study two years ago on larger schoolbuses that concluded the vehicles generally are safe. Itrecommended against installation of seat belts because federalstandards require that seats be designed to form a paddedcompartment around young riders.   All small Type A buses, which include vans converted to carrypupils, already have lap belts for each passenger but don't followrules for compartmentalizing the youngsters.   The draft report recommended crash tests to determine the safetyof various barrier designs with both restrained and unbeltedpassengers in Type A buses. Barriers in front of the first row ofseats in small school buses generally were inferior to those inlarge buses, the report said.   In several cases studied, the report said, passengers werethrown into the front of the bus where they were injured. In oneinstance, two children sitting in a front seat were killed _ onewho wore a lap belt rammed his head into the barrier, and the otherwho was not wearing a belt was thrown through the barrier.   The report said restraining barriers sometimes came loose duringcrashes, moving into the passenger area and exposing sharp edgesthat caused injuries.   The draft also called for a study of the possibility ofrequiring lap-shoulder belts or other restraining systems for allpassengers in Type A buses.   Board member Jim Burnett, who was not at the meeting, said hefavored adopting the staff report as drafted.   In a telephone interview, Burnett said that although schoolbuses provide a highly safe form of transportation, ``the securityof schoolchildren remains a major public safety concern.''</TEXT></DOC>
