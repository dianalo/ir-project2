According to Braniff, the judge recommended it for the route over Houston-based Continental Airlines because the judge believed Braniff's routes would better meet the needs of Dallas and San Antonio, among other reasons.    A spokesman for Continental, a unit of Texas Air Corp., declined to comment. The judge's recommendation now must be approved by Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole and President Reagan. The airline said it expects to receive the clearance by mid-July. Braniff has been flying the routes under a temporary exemption since October 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
