Short-rotationforestry is an alternative to conventional agriculture on marginal land.Since several harvests occur from a single planting, short rotation systemsprovide relatively permanent vegetation. The potential for improved landuse and resource conservation exists in conversion of marginal land toshort-rotation systems. Short-rotation forestry involves fast-growing,deciduous woody species planted at close spacings and harvested overshort time periods (4 to 10 years). Harvested trees resprout from establishedrootstocks and supply wood through coppice production. Tree plantingdensities from 5000 trees/ha to 10,000 trees/ha appear favorable. Thirteenspecies seem promising for the Great Lakes region (Illinois, Indiana,Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin). Average annual yields inthe US have been 8 to 9 dry Mg/ha. Maximum yields on good sites withoptimum species have been 20--30 dry Mg/ha yr. Annual yields on marginalsites are expected to range from 4 to 15 dry Mg/ha considering both seedlingand coppice productivity. Recommendations are discussed for short-rotationwood production on marginal land in the region. 38 refs., 6 figs., 6tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
