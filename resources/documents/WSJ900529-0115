White   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>05/29/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A3</SO><CO>   LABOR GM</CO><IN>AUTOMOBILES (AUT)CDS, INTEREST RATES, COMMERCIAL PAPER (FIN)</IN><LP>   DETROIT -- Stung by criticism of a plan that will sharplyboost their pensions, General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger B.Smith and his successor, Robert C. Stempel, said theyprobably wouldn't put such an issue to a shareholder voteagain.   GM shareholders approved the plan by an 83% to 17% marginFriday. While the vote was lopsided, the proposal to boostexecutive pensions attracted the most anti-management ballotsof any issue on the GM proxy this year. Now that it haspassed, one result will be that Mr. Smith, who retires August1, will see his annual pension benefit nearly double to $1.2million a year.</LP><TEXT>   Separately, GM also disclosed:   -- It plans to increase its European vehicle-makingcapacity by 25% to 2 million vehicles by the mid-1990s, inpart by building cars in a joint venture with East Germanauto maker Automobilewerke Eisenach. The Eisenach venturewill begin production this year at a rate of 10,000 carsannually, but GM officials say they hope eventually toincrease output to 150,000 cars annually.   -- It will push in contract talks this summer to get theUnited Auto Workers union to accept three-shift productionplans at U.S. factories. GM currently runs three Europeanfactories on three shift production schedules, and that is amajor factor in the record profits GM is reaping from itsEuropean car operations. UAW officials have balked ataccepting three-shift production in the U.S., in part becausethey suspect it will allow GM to shut more U.S. plants.   But the hottest issue at the annual meeting was clearlypensions. The plan to give 3,350 top executives fatterretirement benefits drew fire from a broad spectrum of GMconstituents ranging from big shareholders to members of theUnited Auto Workers union. Shareholders gathered in thecavernous Fisher Theatre in downtown Detroit cheeredopponents of the plan and booed Mr. Smith when he spoke todefend it as a reasonable effort to make GM's executivebenefits more competitive.   Afterward, Mr. Smith and Mr. Stempel declared that theoutcry had convinced them to think twice about again goingpublic with an issue that could be settled privately by GM'sboard.   &quot;It's an experiment in corporate governance that's goneastray,&quot; Mr. Smith told shareholders. Later, he added: &quot;Ifthis is something that gets blown out of proportion by thepress and damages our reputation, it doesn't help us.&quot;   Mr. Smith argued that GM was losing &quot;good people&quot; becauseits pension benefits were in the bottom 21% of a sample ofbig U.S. companies. Pressed to elaborate, Mr. Smith declaredthat GM had lost &quot;about 60 {managers} here in the last coupleof months to competitors . . . we lost them all the way upand down, {from} plant managers {to} paint superintendents.They were experienced people we need to run our programs.&quot;   With the new pension program, GM's white-collar pensionswill still be in the bottom 39% of large U.S. companies, Mr.Smith said.   Mr. Stempel, seated at Mr. Smith's right hand during apress conference, seconded the chairman's feelings aboutsharing such issues with the public.   &quot;We're certainly going to use judgment in what we bringforward&quot; to shareholders in the future, he said. However, Mr.Stempel added GM should get credit for airing the executivepension issue before the start of contract talks with theUnited Auto Workers union this summer.   &quot;I would certainly much rather go into bargaining with theUAW knowing where we are, as opposed to going throughbargaining and all of a sudden have a surprise,&quot; Mr. Stempelsaid.   Indeed, GM badly hurt its labor relations in 1982 when itwon concessions from the UAW and then announced fat executivebonuses shortly after the union contract was signed.   But UAW leaders showed little appreciation Friday for theadvance notice.   &quot;It's unfortunate that GM stockholders have affirmed thecorporation's plans to award unjustifiable pension increasesto already overpaid GM executives,&quot; said UAW vice presidentStephen P. Yokich, head of the UAW's GM department.   And some big GM shareholders who opposed the pension plandidn't quit after the votes were tallied.   &quot;GM would make much better use of this money by investingin product research and development, plant modernization ordirecting the funds&quot; to beef up the company's pension assets,said Michigan State Treasurer Robert A. Bowman, who managesretirement funds holding some 8.8 million GM shares. New YorkCity's pension fund also criticized the plan, saying it&quot;unduly benefits those who are currently retiring.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
