Details of the possible accord are sketchy, but executives say it could include setting floor prices, export quotas, or both, and involve the U.S., Japan, the European Community and South Korea as potential signatories.    In Washington, where Japanese and U.S. negotiators are scheduled to meet next week to air their latest round of differences over the existing trade accord, a U.S trade-policy official said the Japanese have never officially broached the idea of a multilateral chip pact.    Under such an agreement, modeled, say, on the multifiber agreement, which sets specific country quotas for textile exports, Japanese chip companies could become more competitive than under the accord in effect with the U.S., Japanese executives said. U.S. and South Korean competitors, currently unconstrained by the bilateral pact's fair-market values on Japanese chips, have been underselling Japanese producers and gaining market share, they said.    But given the Reagan administration's opposition to floor prices and quotas on chips, Japan's multilateral-accord idea isn't expected to get very far. &quot;They're probably sending up a trial balloon to see how we react,&quot; said the U.S. trade-policy official in Washington. &quot;I'm very skeptical, but we're always interested to hear what the Japanese have in mind,&quot; the official said. </TEXT></DOC>
