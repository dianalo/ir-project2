ScheierandM;Let's say you're building an application that tracks potato chip shipmentsfrom your warehouse to the stores.andM;A warehouse clerk enters the data in the PC, which uploads it to themainframe, which tells everyone from the factory to the billing departmentthat the chips are on the way.andM;But how do you make sure the chips were actually sent to a store and aren'tin the trunk of the clerk's car?andM;The answer lies in what one company calls ''data certification'' -- designinga system so only the right people have access to it, so the data is correctand so you can track who made what changes to the data.andM;Mainframe-based systems have long provided for data integrity, but local areanetworks often lack the strong password systems and ''audit trails'' found inminis and mainframes, according to Kenneth DeHoff, a senior consultant withAndersen Consulting, a Chicago-based information and systems-securitypractice.andM;At Coca-Cola U.S.A.andP;  in Atlanta, applications-development specialist TimByers is tackling such issues while developing a system to track installationand repair orders for vending machines owned by the firm's 421 Americanbottlers.andM;Byers is planning a two-level password system, creating passwords at thenetwork log-on level through Novell Inc.'s NetWare LAN operating system, andat the level of the application, which is Borland International Inc.'sParadox database.andM;''With Novell, we can restrict access to certain files based on the log-inI.D.,'' Byers said.andP;  Once in Paradox, ''all the menu items require apassword.''andM;For example, a phone operator entering service requests ''has no businessentering the time spent repairing a piece of equipment,'' he added.andP;  Theoperator can log on to Paradox, but can't access the menu for recordingrepair times.andM;Once the right employee is in the right application, the next step is how tokeep the person from entering the wrong data.andM;At the Canadian National Railways (CN) in Montreal, a companywide, PC-basedpayroll system has been designed to keep data accurate.andP;  The application,developed in-house, includes ''internal edits'' that limit the choices of theperson entering the data, according to Jim Gardner, assistant chief ofengineering planning.andM;Detailed information about CN's 22,000 miles of track will be loaded onto LANservers at regional centers, where foremen of track crews will phone ininformation about the work they have done that day.andM;If the foreman tells the operator that his crew fixed a stretch of track at anon-existent crossing, ''the system says that's not valid; there's no suchplace as a 'crossing at Bitter Lake Pier,' '' Gardner said.andM;The mistake gets fixed instantly, he said, unlike the current system where apaper form is sent back to the foreman weeks later.andM;Coke is building similar ''self-edits'' into its system using featuresincluded in Paradox, according to Byers.andM;When a database becomes crucial to a company's operation, backups becomecrucial too, according to DeHoff.andP;  ''Companies don't do backups, particularlyin a PC environment, often enough.andP;  If you do daily input and daily changes,you should do backup on a daily basis,'' he said.andM;Documentation, for both end users and those who maintain the system, is alsovital, observers said.andP;  At Coca-Cola, the bottlers' service departments arenew to PCs, so ''training is a real issue,'' Byers said.andP;  ''The user guidemust be very explicit and easy to use.''andM;CN's staffers in remote locations who had maintained dumb terminalsparticipated in a Novell network training course.andP;  ''But we found it was tootechnical for them,'' Gardner said, so CN is conducting basic DOS courses toprepare them for the rigors of the LAN.andM;But for all the problems, the benefits of PC-based corporate databases arehere to stay.andP;  CN, for example, hopes its system will not only cut costs buthelp it recover millions of dollars on outside repair work that is now lostdue to disputes over paper-based records.andM;So companies will include data integrity in their internal applications, andsoftware vendors will do the same for off-the-shelf products.andM;''We see these features as being very important for a work-group sharing ofinformation,'' said Jeffrey Beir, senior product manager for databaseproducts for Lotus Development Corp., in Cambridge, Mass.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
