A department report released Friday said 49 billion barrels ofcrude oil outside known fields could, if found, be developed withexisting technology.   At the current price of $18 a barrel, however, only two-thirds ofthe total would be economic to produce, it said.   In its most recent previous estimate in 1981, the departmentestimated 83 billion barrels of undiscovered crude. One barrelsequals 42 gallons.   Throughout the decade, the amount of known U.S. oil reserves hasheld steady at about 30 billion barrels and production has remainednear 3 billion barrels yearly.   Thus, the new estimate of undiscovered resources means the lifeexpectancy of all U.S. oil resources _ except unconventional sourcessuch as oil shales and tar sands _ has dropped to 26 years. The 1981figures implied a life expectancy of 37 years.   ``The change is significant,'' said Gary Hill, chief of the U.S.Geological Survey's office of energy and marine biology. The surveyproduced the report in collaboration with the Interior Department'sMinerals Management Service.   A key reason for the lower estimate of undiscovered oilresources, the report said, is the failure in recent years ofdrilling prospects once thought to be promising.   ``The massive exploration effort of industry of the late 1970sand early 1980s simply did not confirm some of the geologicalexpectations,'' the report said.   Hill said in an interview that some of the most significantdrilling disappointments were in the Overthrust Belt in the RockyMountain area and off the Atlantic Coast.   Although prospects have dimmed in some offshore Alaska areas,that state overall has become the most promising development areafor oil in the United States, the report said.   The report estimated 13.2 billion barrels of oil are recoverablein Alaska, compared with a 1981 estimate of 6.9 billion barrels. Theincrease is due largely to new geological data on the Alaska CoastalPlain, the site of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Industry istrying to persuade Congress to open the refuge to oil exploration.   The report said the United States has an estimated 399 trillioncubic feet of undiscovered natural gas, down from the 1981 estimateof 594 trillion cubic feet.   The amount of undiscovered natural gas liquids, such as butaneand propane, was cut in half, to 9 billion barrels.   In response to the report, Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Mooresaid new technologies, such as horizontal drilling, willsignificantly increase the amount of oil and gas that eventually canbe developed.   ``Even after considering all these factors, there clearly is adecline,'' Moore said in a statement. ``This is all the more reasonwhy we must proceed with a national energy strategy to contend withdeclining domestic production and increasing imports.''</TEXT></DOC>
