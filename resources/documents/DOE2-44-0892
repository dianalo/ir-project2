A small fraction of thisstream is processed outside the reactor for tritium recovery. The blanketconsists of a beryllium multiplier and carbon/steel reflector. A steelclad is used for all materials. A carbon reflector is employed to reducethe beryllium thickness used in the blanket for a specific tritium breedingratio. The breeder particle size has to exceed few microns ({ge}2 microns)to avoid sticking problems on the cold surfaces of the heat exchanger.The helium gas pressure is in the range of 2 to 3 MPa to carry the blanketand the heat exchanger loop. The solid breeder concentration in the heliumstream is 1 to 5 volume percent. A high lithium-6 enrichment is usedto produce a high tritium breeding ratio and to reduce the breeder concentrationin the helium gas. At a lithium-6 enrichment of 90%, the local tritiumbreeding ratio is 2.03 based on a one-dimensional poloidal model. Thetotal thickness of the helium stream is only 4 cm out of the 50 cm totalblanket thickness. The blanket uses a 35 cm of beryllium for neutronmultiplication. A simple multi-layer design is employed where the blanketsector has the helium coolant flowing in the poloidal direction. Theblanket concept has several unique advantages which are very beneficialfor fusion reactors including ITER. 10 refs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
