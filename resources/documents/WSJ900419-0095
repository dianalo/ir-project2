At the same time, however, the high court said there mustbe limits on the enforcement power of federal judges. Thecourt ruled unanimously that U.S. District Judge RussellClark, who is handling the complex Kansas City case, went toofar when he raised the tax rate himself in 1987 instead ofordering the school board do it.</LP><TEXT>   Despite the court's disagreement with Judge Clark'smethods, the decision yesterday was a surprising civil rightsvictory. In a 5-4 decision written by Justice Byron White,the high court ruled that a federal judge may order schoolofficials to raise the funds to pay for a desegregation planand may block enforcement of state laws limiting taxincreases that interfere with funding the plan.   The ratification of judicial power was unexpected.Conservatives, including some justices, have criticized whatthey deemed to be abuses of federal judicial power. And thecourt's growing concern with this issue has been apparent, asevidenced by its recent decision in the Yonkers, N.Y.,housing desegregation case. In January, the high court ruledthat a federal judge handling the case had exceeded hisauthority by imposing contempt fines on city council members.   Moreover, the high court announced its intention to reviewthe Kansas City case last spring, as it was issuing a stringof civil rights decisions that substantially limited federallaws on employment discrimination.   Had the high court ruled that federal courts don't havethe power to require that their orders be funded by state andlocal governments, the decision would have limited theauthority of judges, not only to implement schooldesegregation plans, but also to set and enforce standardsfor prison and jail systems, for state mental institutionsand for other government programs.   Arthur Benson, a Kansas City lawyer who represented blackparents and children challenging the local school system,said, &quot;This is an important victory for civil rights ingeneral. It reinforces the broad discretion that federalcourts have to right wrongs.&quot;   That broad discretion dismayed Justice Anthony Kennedy,who wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined by ChiefJustice William Rehnquist and Justices Sandra O'Connor andAntonin Scalia. &quot;This assertion of judicial power in one ofthe most sensitive of policy areas, that involving taxation,begins a process that . . . could threaten fundamentalalteration of the form of government our Constitutionembodies,&quot; Justice Kennedy wrote.   The Kansas City dispute began in 1977. Parents andchildren and the school board sued the state of Missouri formaintaining a segregated school system in the district thatincludes much of Kansas City and parts of neighboringIndependence and Sugar Creek. In 1984, Judge Clark agreedthat the system needed to be desegregated and, between 1985and 1987, ordered a broad and expensive plan of constructionand renovation of schools and reassignment of students.   In 1987, Judge Clark ruled that the state and schooldistrict should share the total cost of the plan, which hasbeen estimated between $500 million and $700 million. But theschool district can only raise funds through the localproperty tax, and state law puts a cap on property taxincreases unless approved by the voters.   Voters repeatedly rejected tax increases to pay for theplan, prompting Judge Clark to raise the tax rate himself to$4 per $100 of assessed value, from $2.05. In 1988, a federalappeals court in St. Louis upheld the tax increase, butsuggested that in the future, Judge Clark should order theschool district to set the rate and that he should blockenforcement of the state law capping tax increases.   Yesterday, the high court struck down Judge Clark's owntax increase, but upheld the appeals court's approach that hecould order the school district to raise taxes.   The decision will allow continued funding of the plan. Butpractical problems remain for Judge Clark to resolve. He mustdecide whether to refund the tax collected for 1987, whichproduced some $30 million. If he decides that refunds are inorder, he must decide if all of the taxpayers are entitled tothem or only those who, at the suggestion of the localLandmark Legal Foundation, paid in protest and placed $12million in an escrow fund.   Despite the practical problems, Allen Snyder, a Washingtonlawyer for the Kansas City school board, said, &quot;There is noquestion about the system we're operating under now.&quot; He saidthat under an earlier ruling by Judge Clark, any shortfall infunding caused by refunds must be paid by the state.(Missouri vs. Jenkins)                                                                                                          Child Pornography                                                                                                          The court ruled, 6-3, that a state may make it illegal topossess or view child pornography, even in the privacy ofone's home. The decision, written by Justice White, upheld anOhio law and effectively puts the court's stamp of approvalon the laws of 18 other states as well.   In 1982, the high court ruled that states may make itillegal to sell pictures of children in sexual poses. But thecourt hadn't previously said that states may punish thebuyer, as well as the seller, of such material. The Ohio lawmakes it a crime for individuals to possess nude pictures ofchildren, except parents who may have nude pictures of theirown children. The court said that such a ban doesn't violatethe First Amendment guarantee of free speech.   Justice William Brennan dissented, joined by JusticesThurgood Marshall and John Stevens. Justice Brennan said thatthe Ohio law is much too broad because it outlaws depictionsof nudity that aren't obscene and that are protected by theFirst Amendment.   Despite upholding Ohio's law, the court on technicalgrounds threw out the conviction and six-month prisonsentence for a Columbus man charged with possession of nudephotos of a young boy. The court ordered a new trial.

The decision involves the relationship between so-calledcontingent-fee agreements and court-ordered civil rightsattorneys' fees. A contingent-fee agreement is one in which alawyer agrees to be paid a share of what his client wins,usually 40%. In a civil rights lawsuit under federal law, afederal judge may order the loser to pay the winner's legalfees, once the judge sets a reasonable rate and number ofhours for the winning lawyer.   The federal appeals courts have split over whether lawyerson contingent fees may collect more than a court-orderedaward in civil rights cases or whether the court award is themaximum. In an opinion written by Justice White, the highcourt ruled that contingent-fee agreements are valid in civilrights cases.   The decision was a defeat for a California man who hired alawyer on a contingent-fee basis to sue the Long Beach policefor prosecuting him with false testimony. He won $2.12million in federal court, and the judge ordered the police topay his lawyer $75,000 in fees. But the lawyer went to courtto recover his contingent fee, $406,000.
