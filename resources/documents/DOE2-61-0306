The Congress has considered several piecesof legislation spelling out potential approaches to the problem and settinggoals for emission reduction, mostly emphasizing the control of oxidesof sulfur and nitrogen. Significant policy concern is the dollar coststo the nation's economy of achieving the intended effects of the legislationand the potential impacts on economic activity---in particular, lossesof both coal mining and secondary service sector employment in statesand regions dependent on the mining of high sulfur coal. There are severaldirect economic effects of regulations such as the acid rain controllegislation. One of the more obvious effects was the switching from highsulfur coal to low sulfur coal. This would result in increases in employmentand coal business procurements in low sulfur coal mining regions, butalso would result in lower employment and lower coal business procurementsin high sulfur coal mining areas. The potential negative effects arethe immediate policy concern and are the focus of this report. 15 refs.,1 fig., 17 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
