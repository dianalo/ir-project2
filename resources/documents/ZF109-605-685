(Products).andO;Ticker:    SUNW.andO;Product:   NeWSprint (Printer software).andO;Topic:     EvaluationPrinter SoftwareSoftware packages.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Sun's NeWSprint: A New Way To PrintandM;Sun Microsystems Inc. has introduced a new printing system for UNIX-basedworkstations and servers that it says makes printing documents on a networkeasier and less expensive.andM;Called Network-extensible Window System print, or NeWSprint, the softwareproduct lets any of Sun's Scalable Processor Architecture (SPARC) systems, orany SPARC clone, print PostScript-compatible documents on almost any printer,including laser, ink jet and dot matrix.andM;Sun says the software departs from the traditional, or personal computer,method of printing high-quality documents.andP;  In the traditional method, a PCsends a signal to a relatively expensive printer containing the software andelectronics necessary to print PostScript-type documents.andM;In the NeWSprint system, Sun says, the workstation contains all font and pagelayout information.andP;  It then sends the information to any printing device itis connected to, allowing documents to be printed in PostScript quality.andP;  Theprinter can be a low-cost dot matrix model or a high-speed laser printer,such as Sun's SPARCprinter, a 12-page-per-minute laser printer designed forthe NeWSprint system and announced in conjunction with it.andP;  The printerreplaces the Sun Laser Writer II and is available for $2,695.andM;NeWSprint can run on a stand-alone workstation directly connected to aprinter or on a local area network.andP;  A dedicated print server is not needed,and NeWSprint allows printing from any workstation or server on the network.andO;Printing can also be done in the background, so users can continue to work inan application while sending documents to a printer.andM;Sun also says that investments in PostScript printers can be sizable, and theequipment may become obsolete very quickly.andP;  Because NeWSprint is asoftware-only product, it can be updated by installing a new version of thesoftware.andM;Although NeWSprint is designed to run under Sun's NeWS graphical interfacesystem for its SPARCstations, the software can run under any UNIX graphicalinterface, such as Sun View or Open Windows.andP;  Under Open Windows, NeWSprintlets users print documents in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG)format, duplicating screen images in printed documents.andP;  Documents can beprinted by dragging a file icon with a mouse and dropping it on a print toolicon.andM;NeWSprint comes with 57 built-in fonts.andP;  Each font is scalable and maintainsa sharp image at small point sizes, the company says.andP;  Additional fonts areavailable.andP;  Support for the SPARCprinter and printers from Hewlett-PackardCo. and Seiko Epson Corp. is built in.andP;  Many other printer manufacturers havealso announced support for NeWSprint.andP;  The software is available now for aprice of $495.andP;  SUN MICROSYSTEMS INC., Mountain View, Calif.andM;SOFTWAREandM;Trouble, Mac?andP;
