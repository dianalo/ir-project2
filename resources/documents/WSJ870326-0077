TaylorStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> ENVIRONMENT (ENV)MINING, METALS (NON-PRECIOUS) (MIN)UTILITIES (UTI)ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists advising the Environmental Protection Agency have concluded that the agency's data suggest little or no lake acidification is occurring in the Northeast from acid rain, EPA officials said.    EPA officials said they accept the scientists' conclusions, which reversed the agency staff's initial findings that about 300 northeastern lakes and possibly as many as 1,500 will become acidic over the next 50 years if current rates of acidification persist.    As a result, data that initially appeared to be fuel for environmentalists' demands for acid-rain controls have become ammunition for their opponents. The scientists' conclusion is consistent with claims by the coal and electric utility industries that there is no proof that lakes and streams will suffer substantial and increasing damage if sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants continue at current levels. The scientists presented their conclusions to EPA officials at a meeting last week in Corvallis, Ore.    The finding comes just after President Reagan reaffirmed a commitment to a $2.5 billion, five-year project to subsidize power plants that demonstrate ways of cutting acid emissions from coal boilers. The conclusion could strengthen his determination to fend off demands from Canadians and U.S. environmentalists for tougher action against emissions from coal-fired plants.    EPA Administrator Lee Thomas has been saying that research does not show a need for anything as drastic as the 50% reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions that congressional advocates support. Armed with the new findings, he went further yesterday, telling a group of House Republicans that &quot;you may not need to bring (emissions) down at all.&quot;    The scientists' conclusion arises from an EPA study of the capacity of soils to neutralize acidic rain. The EPA staff predicted increasing acidification of lakes on the assumption that some soils with low acid-neutralizing capacity soon would reach the limit of their capacity to absorb sulfuric acid.    But scientists led by Arne Henriksen of the Norwegian Institute for Water Research said no such absorption is taking place, according to Courtney Riordan, director of the EPA's office of acid deposition. The scientists said acidic rain is being neutralized by the exchange of hydrogen ions for calcium and magnesium ions in the soil, Mr. Riordan said.    &quot;They said it appears to indicate that the Northeast is in a steady state,&quot; said Mr. Riordan. Based on their analysis, he said, &quot;You cannot make a prediction that further acidification will occur at current loads.&quot; The analysis indicates that over the next 50 years, the number of lakes turning acidic in the Northeast could be zero and at worst would be a few hundred, he said. There are 6,350 lakes in the region, stretching from northeast Pennsylvania to northern Maine, according to Mr. Riordan.    Also, Mr. Riordan said that while the picture could darken if sulfurous emissions increase, &quot;you'd expect to see some recovery&quot; in acidic lakes under the latest analysis if emissions decline.    The EPA predicts that sulfur dioxide emissions will be stable through about 1990 and then increase slightly. Electric utilities forecast decreasing sulfur dioxide emissions, and environmentalists warn they will rise. Yesterday, Mr. Thomas said he hopes to craft a package of administrative and legislative initiatives that will ensure that emissions don't rise.    Despite the administration's reluctance, environmental groups have put a high priority on pushing an acid-rain control bill through Congress in the next two years. They have won crucial support from a group of House Republicans led by Rep. Sherwood Boehlert (R., N.Y.). </TEXT></DOC>
