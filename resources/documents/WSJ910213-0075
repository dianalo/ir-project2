In a letter to William Seidman, chairman of the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp., five banking groups outlined theirpreviously disclosed plan. Under the industry's proposal, theFDIC would borrow $10 billion as needed by selling bondsbacked by the government to a syndicate of banks. Theinsurance fund would repay the bonds, plus interest, withrevenue from banks based on a special assessment on bankassets, minus capital.</LP><TEXT>   The banks also proposed establishing a $2 billion fund tohelp private investors finance bank mergers. The money wouldbe borrowed from bank reserves held by the Federal Reserve.   In submitting its plan, the groups contended the Bushadministration's banking reform plan didn't go far enough inits proposals to limit the scope of federal depositinsurance, which is financed by premiums paid by the banks.   The groups called on the government to modify a policyunder which the FDIC often protects deposits that exceed the$100,000 ceiling in sick banks that are considered too big tofail. &quot;The associations believe strongly that too-big-to-failpolicies are significantly increasing the costs of thefailure resolutions of the Bank Insurance Fund, and we,understandably, are unwilling to continue to underwrite theseunnecessary costs,&quot; the groups said in the letter to Mr.Seidman.   In cases where the government determines that all depositsmust be protected in order to limit risk to the financialsystem, the Treasury or the Fed, not the FDIC, should bearthe cost, the bankers argued. &quot;The costs of dealing withsystemic risks, as was the case with Chrysler, Lockheed andNew York City, should be borne elsewhere,&quot; the bankers said,referring to bailouts voted by Congress.   Last week, the administration proposed some steps to curbthe too-big-to-fail policy, but it didn't go nearly as far asthe bankers want. The banking groups -- the American BankersAssociation, the Association of Bank Holding Cos., theAssociation of Reserve City Bankers, the Consumer BankersAssociation and the Independent Bankers Association ofAmerica -- also criticized an administration proposal tolimit the number of insured accounts a person can hold in anyone bank, saying such restrictions wouldn't be necessary ifthe government got rid of or sharply limited thetoo-big-to-fail policy.   The industry plans to take its campaign against thetoo-big-to-fail policy to Congress, where it could get asympathetic hearing. Members of the banking committees havecriticized the unfairness of a policy that protectsdepositors in big banks but not in small banks.   Several other parts of the bankers' plan would requirelegislation, including Federal Reserve funding of bankmergers and the proposal to repay the $10 billion inborrowings for the insurance fund with an assessment againstbank assets. Currently, assessments are based on domesticdeposits. The asset-based assessment would impose aproportionately higher cost on large banks relying on foreigndeposits.   The industry plan could face considerable opposition inCongress. Yesterday, House Banking Committee Chairman HenryGonzalez (D., Texas) called the proposal a &quot;public relationssmokescreen designed to hide the fact that banks may soon beat the federal welfare window&quot; seeking taxpayer assistance tobail out the insurance fund.   Although Mr. Seidman had suggested an industry infusion of$25 billion to augment the dwindling Bank Insurance Fund, hehas endorsed the general thrust of the bankers' plan. He,like the bankers, believes that a combination of tighteningthe limits of the too-big-to-fail policy and a program toencourage mergers could sharply reduce the drain on thedeposit insurance fund.</TEXT></DOC>
