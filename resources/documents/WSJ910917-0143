The former Soviet satellites and the Union ofSoviet Socialist Republics itself are daily providing lessonson how not to run an economy. Economic problems led Swedishvoters Sunday to abandon the long-governing Social Democrats.But socialism always was more than a scheme for economicmanagement; it was a plan for the moral ordering of people'slives.   Socialist ideas go back as far as Plato's &quot;Republic,&quot; butmodern socialism really got its start with concerns aboutperceived abuses of the Industrial Revolution early in the19th century -- child labor, long working hours, extremeincome inequality. Socialists blamed the problems oncapitalism and the free market that went with it.</LP><TEXT>   Socialism fairly quickly became a political movement,since there was no shortage of people who were, or thoughtthey were, exploited by the Industrial Revolution. In themid-19th century, the German government of ChancellorBismarck invented social security -- not because of thechancellor's kind heart, but because of his determination tofend off this growing socialist movement.   The ultimate aim of socialism -- ownership and operationof the means of production and distribution by society,rather than private individuals, with all members of societysharing equally in the work and the products -- hasn't beenfully successful anywhere for more than brief periods. Eventhe Soviets quickly found the Communist system wouldn't workwithout special perquisites for those who were judged to bemost important to its functioning.   But Michael Keran, chief economist of Prudential InsuranceCo., points out that a number of socialist ideas aboutmorality are still alive and well, not only in the SovietUnion but also in the U.S. and other Western nations.   There's a widespread feeling, for instance, that incomeinequality is somehow bad. The huge salaries of manycorporate chief executives may occasion envy, but there isalso a feeling that, somehow, such payments aren't &quot;right.&quot;But inequality is accepted because of a recognition thatefforts to fully tax away such incomes would damage economicgrowth and efficiency.   Yet in the nonsocialist West there's a willingness to usetaxes to nibble away at income inequality. Many taxspecialists argue that it would be best to tax consumption,which, after all, is what we take from society. But thepublic preference is to tax income, which is supposed tomeasure what we contribute to society.   Dividends are taxed to the corporations that pay them andalso to the stockholders who receive them, and the publicsees nothing wrong with that. The taxes fall on capital, notlabor, and they work toward reducing income inequality.   Karl Marx tried to convince everyone that income equalitywas not a moral issue but a scientific one. All value, hesaid, is derived from the labor content of goods. Thesupplier of capital provides no value, and his profits comeout of the share that legitimately belongs to labor.   What is more or less accepted in the West, however, is notthis &quot;labor theory of value&quot; but socialist morality. Thesocialists in Britain's Labor Party for a time werenationalizing much of British industry to try to ensure thatthe workers got their &quot;fair&quot; share, but Margaret Thatcherstepped in and spoiled their fun.   In Britain, as in the U.S., however, governmentalintervention in the economy is now generally accepted.Various governmental commissions do their best to preventexploitation of children in the work force, unsafe workingconditions, discrimination of various sorts. If privateenterprise won't supply such amenities as commuter railroads,the government steps in and does it.   My suspicion is that a lot of these socialist ideas willsurvive and even thrive, both in the former Communist nationsand the West. Germany is generally regarded as the last wordin free enterprise, but it also is one of the most thoroughlydeveloped welfare states. One of the problems for the EastGerman economy, as it tries to melt into a unified Germany,is absorbing all those German welfare costs.   As Mr. Keran says, it's not as though capitalism had nomorality of its own to offer and so had to settle forsocialist notions. &quot;The economic theory of capitalism,&quot; hesays, &quot;is that capital and labor both contribute to theproduction of goods and services. Voluntary exchange in themarketplace sets the value of both capital and labor. . . .Income inequality is not exploitation but rather reflects therelative value to society of individual skills.&quot;   The focus of unalloyed capitalism is equality ofopportunity, not equality of income. The state gives everyonea start with publicly funded education, but the results ofthat are in large part up to the individual. So far thereseems to be limited willingness in the former Communiststates to accept that reasoning. Companies are privatizedprimarily to preserve jobs, not to sort out the firms thatcan survive on their own. Many citizens long for the oldstate subsidies. So some socialist ideas seem sure tosurvive.   It would be nice to think that the East in time would moveto true capitalism and equality of opportunity. Up to now,however, the West hasn't supplied a particularly good rolemodel.</TEXT></DOC>
