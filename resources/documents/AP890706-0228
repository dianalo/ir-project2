But the hard-pressed Finance Ministry _ already grappling with awidening budget deficit and higher army spending to deal with thePalestinian uprising _ has been hesitant to come to the rescue.   The nation's unemployment rate has climbed to 8.6 percent, andRabbi Moshe Zeev Feldman, the deputy labor minister, says it couldhit a 20-year high of 10 percent by year's end if no action istaken. Feldman says more than 132,000 Israelis are out of work.   The most dramatic protest involved 20 mayors from developmenttowns, who chained themselves to the gate outside Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir's office last weekend to demand relief for unemployedresidents and their own cash-strapped municipal coffers.   They later set up tents across from the Prime Ministry andthreatened to camp there until their demands were met.   The development towns were set up to attract Jewish immigrants torural areas, but many of their local factories have been closed orforced to cut workers in the economic downturn.   Yehiel Zohar, council leader from Netivot in the southern NegevDesert, said unemployment was twice the national average. Decliningtax revenues and rising costs have pushed the town budget $3.5million into the red, he said.   ``People are desperate, and we have nowhere else to go,'' Zoharsaid.   About 140 workers, including many recently demobilized soldiers,blocked streets in the northern town of Beit Shean this week toprotest losing jobs on archaeological sites. Employees laid off byelectronics and defense contractors also have picketed there.   And in Tel Aviv, tax men raided the Tel Aviv Museum, which owesnearly $1 million in back taxes. The Jerusalem Post said the taxsquad planned to confiscate 100 paintings but settled fortelevisions, typewriters and other office equipment after museumofficials said a court order was needed to take the artwork.   The city has said it cannot rescue the museum, and 30 percent ofthe museum staff may be laid off.   Israeli analysts predict a slow economic turnaround.   ``The recession seems to be bottoming out now,'' said YacovSheinin of Economic Models Inc. in Tel Aviv. ``It will be a slowcomeback, but I think by the beginning of 1990, the performance willbe much better.''   He predicted the economy, after two lackluster years, could growabout 4 percent next year. But he said factories would be slow torehire, ``meaning we'll probably face a high rate of unemploymentthrough 1990 and into 1991.''   The unemployment rate in Israel was 5.6 percent of the work forceat the start of the recession in late 1987.   The economic downturn coincided with the start of the Palestinianuprising against Israeli occupation.   Tourism and foreign investment declined sharply. An Arab boycottcut the sale of Israeli goods to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, oneof Israel's leading export markets, and tax collection in the Arabsector remains at a low level. Thousands of Arab workers also leftjobs in Israel, hitting industries such as construction and textilesparticularly hard.   The army last month asked for an additional $210 million to coverthe cost of fighting the uprising, and Finance Minister Shimon Pereswarned that it may have to be balanced with cuts in non-militaryprograms.   Peres has been trying to hold to the economic austerity programhe put in place on Jan. 1 to stem the rising budget deficit.   He has devalued the shekel three times against the dollar, from1.6 to 2 shekels; cut government subsidies on food and fuel; andresisted ministry calls for higher spending.   But in an economy that traditionally has turned to the governmentto get it through rough times, Peres has been forced to makeconcessions to help ailing state-supported institutions.   He has agreed to a $2.6 billion bail-out program for the nation'sailing kibbutz collective farms and a $50 million loan to theHistadrut-controlled Koor industrial conglomerate, which wasthreatened with bankruptcy.   Earlier this week, the Parliament passed a $9 millionloan-guarantee program to assist more than 130 recession-weakenedcompanies. A proposal put forward to assist the development townshas been estimated by the Finance Ministry at $150 million.</TEXT></DOC>
