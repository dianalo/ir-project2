Mead, director of transportation issues in GAO's Resources,Community and Economic Development Division, who predicted many other changesin the automation projects.andM;Eight of the 12 major projects in the National Airspace System (NAS) Planwere delayed this year by at least 200 days, Mead told the HouseAppropriations Subcommittee on Transportation.andP;  The delays stemmed from FAA'sfailure to test the systems properly before deciding to go ahead withproduction, he said.andM;Among the most important projects he listed, the Advanced Automation System(AAS) has been delayed because of software development problems.andP;  Otherdelayed projects include the Computer Resources Nucleus project, the ModeSelect project and the FAA's Interim Support Plan (ISP).andM;FAA Administrator James B. Busey said he agreed with 90 percent of GAO'sfindings regarding project delays and high costs.andP;  He said improving theacquisition process has been his major goal since being appointedadministrator 10 months ago.andM;&quot;In February I announced the realignment of the agencyhs acquisition systemsto deal more effectively with increased spending levels needed over the nextfive years,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;It's partly the way GAO does business,&quot; said Michael Sherwin, FAA's directorof management systems.andP;  &quot;They're an audit group that tries to look at data,and if they don't see data that they think they need, they have a problem.&quot;andM;FAA contractors such as IBM Corp. on the AAS project have encounteredtechnical problems in meeting minimum hardware and software requirements,Mead said.andP;  This has delayed the projects and will force FAA to seek moremoney to pay for interim programs.andM;&quot;FAA was allowing contractors to proceed without substantial evidence thatthe proposed system could meet its requirements,&quot; Mead said.andP;  &quot;As a result,hardware and software systems could not perform as promised and modificationshad to be made.&quot;andM;GAO also has criticized FAA for not developing plans to measure its progressin meeting long-term NAS goals.andM;FAA &quot;decision-makers have no yardstick with which to measure the agency'sincremental progress toward meeting long-term goals&quot; of the NAS Plan, such asincreased controller productivity and reduced risk of collisions, Mead said.andM;FAA officials acknowledged recently that the NAS Plan no longer reflected theagency's total modernizations needs and announced the development of theCapital Investment Plan.andM;Described as a comprehensive program, the plan will include the original NASPlan projects and some more projects needed for added capacity, newrequirements and sustaining existing operations.andM;Project PrioritiesandM;Mead told the subcommittee he thought the new plan would held FAA comply withrecommendations GAO made in a previous report, Air Traffic Control: ContinuedImprovements Needed in FAA's Management of the NAS Plan.andP;  The report said FAAshould set project priorities on the basis of benefit-cost ratios, missionneeds or safety considerations.andM;Another GAO audit under way suggests that FAA improperly planned the InterimSupport Plan before seeking funds for the project, Mead said.andP;  The ISP, whichwill cost about $430 million, is a conglomeration of projects designed toresolve maintenance and capacity problems at terminal radar approach controlfacilities until longer-term modernization projects like the AAS arecompleted.andM;&quot;FAA's systems engineering and integration contractor found that seven of the10 individual projects in the program if examined were not cost-beneficialand another was cost-beneficial for only half of the proposed sites,&quot; Meadsaid.andM;Martin Marietta Corp. was the engineering and integration contractor.andM;Several GAA operations officials believe more short-term projects will benecessary before the NAS Plan is completed, Mead said.andP;  One example is theneed for more controller workstations due to the expansion of the Chicagoapproach control operations.andM;The agency's $8.3 billion fiscal 1991 budget request represents a 16 percentincrease over the fiscal 1990 appropriation.andM;The agency's facilities and equipment budget request reached $2.5 billionthis year, 47 percent more than last year.andP;  Mead said the budget increased asthe NAS Plan projects moved into full production and with the addition ofmodernization projects due to NAS Plan delays.andM;Mead said FAA will need between $2.5 billion and $3 billion a year for thenext five years to support the projects.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
