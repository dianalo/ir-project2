The sharp June rise in the trade deficit undermines administration hopes to water down protectionist language in the pending trade bill. Despite the devalued dollar, imports continue to mount, outstripping gains for exports. Some private economists now contend the trade balance won't improve much until the dollar sinks to new, much lower levels against the yen and mark.    Others even assert that only a recession will cut imports enough to balance trade. But the administration still argues that trade is slowly turning around, and it remains comfortable with the dollar's current levels. Officials contend that economic stimulus in Japan, just getting under way, will help U.S. exports later this year.    Still, the disappointing trade results are expected to stiffen U.S. pressure on Taiwan and Korea to let their currencies rise further.    REAGAN SCRAMBLES to reassert control over Central American developments.    Administration officials worry about the possibility of a regional treaty that the U.S. would have trouble accepting. The soon-to-be-dispatched U.S. &quot;technical team&quot; will meet with Central American diplomats and offer advice on cease-fires, amnesties and other issues -- and press them not to let leftists off too easily.    Reagan's Los Angeles meeting with Contra leaders next week is in part a gesture to conservatives still furious at White House strategy. Meanwhile, some Democrats who initially criticized Speaker Wright for signing on to Reagan's peace plan now say the gamble is paying off; they say it shows they can formulate a foreign policy and participate in bipartisan efforts.    DEMOCRATS INCREASE efforts to lure dollars from wealthy contributors.    Speaker Wright is making 25 big-dollar fund-raising trips for the House campaign committee this year; O'Neill would make one at most. The three main party committees this year get 48% of their reported donations from over-$200 donors and PACs, up from 32% two years ago. Separately, unnamed corporations give $913,000, in addition to Joan Kroc's highly publicized $1 million gift.    Republican donations plunge 40% from two years ago. Both small and large donors withhold support, demoralized by Reagan's troubles and loss of the Senate -- and deluged by appeals from competing conservative groups and presidential hopefuls. Small donors remain the GOP mainstay; only 32% comes from PACs and big givers, up slightly from 30% two years ago.    The GOP still gets nearly $4 for every $1 reported by the Democrats. But the gap is cut nearly in half from 1985, when it was $7.50 to $1.    AIR-SAFETY WORRIES prompt Sen. Byrd and other lawmakers to consider requiring the FAA to freeze or lower the number of airline and small-plane flights at congested airports. Rep. English even proposes re-creating the defunct Civil Aeronautics Board; that is unlikely now, but if &quot;things don't improve over the next year, watch out,&quot; one aviation official says.    GORE AND GEPHARDT make inroads among Southerners. Tennessean Gore scores well among Southern legislators at their Little Rock conference. Gephardt boasts endorsements from 30 Southern House Democrats; some accompany him through Dixie. The Missourian claims to have raised 40% of his funds from the South, including $90,000 in two days this week.    ROBERTSON REDUCES religious overtones in his presidential candidacy, which he may formally announce late next month. His strategists say they will stress &quot;Republican reasons, not religious reasons,&quot; for his candidacy. An aide says: &quot;We try to refer to him as often as we can as just plain Pat, not 'Reverend.'&quot;    ON THE TRAIL: Interior Secretary Hodel, a favorite target of cartoonists after his staff's sunglasses-and-floppy-hat suggestion about the ozone layer, shows up on the funny pages in a better light: He is appearing in the &quot;Mark Trail&quot; comic strip, where he recruits the hero for his PR campaign to keep up U.S. parks and public lands.    RESHAPING RICO: A compromise nears on changing the civil-racketeer law.    After years of argument, business groups, liberals and labor unions agree on proposed changes in the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act. The compromise seeks to sharply limit damage awards in most private RICO lawsuits, while providing protection and possibly punitive damages for defrauded small investors.    The National Association of Manufacturers, ACLU, AFL-CIO and liberal Sen. Metzenbaum are among those who have signed on to the deal. Ralph Nader and key House subcommittee Chairman Conyers still oppose it. But Judiciary Chairman Rodino serves notice he will bring up the measure with or without Conyers's backing.    Accountants remain unhappy with the compromise, fearing it still leaves them too exposed to potential lawsuits.    MINOR MEMOS: Senor presidente, phone home: National Security Adviser Carlucci, in Santa Barbara with Reagan, is staying in the Biltmore Hotel's Ortega Cottage. . . . In a fund-raising letter boasting of his strong ties to Israel, Haig misspells Begin's and Rabin's first names. . . . Humorist Mark Russell says that five years from now, Ollie North will be &quot;the junior senator from New York, who narrowly defeats Bernhard Goetz in a runoff.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
