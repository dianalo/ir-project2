Signs of an economic upturn have made the question timely. And stocks of cyclical companies -- those whose fortunes are closely tied to the industrial cycle -- already have made a forceful move.    &quot;I think we're 50% or 60% of the way through the cycle,&quot; Richard Eakle, a technical market analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., says. He says he is not referring to the business cycle but to stock-price movements, which normally precede changes in economic activity.    Mr. Eakle says he has been recommending the cyclicals since last summer but believes that &quot;you can still put on a big run in these stocks.&quot; His favorites are Canadian Pacific, Reynolds Metals and Union Camp. Among the indicators Mr. Eakle finds encouraging are strength in lumber futures and scrap metal prices.    Brian Fabbri, chief economist and investment strategist at Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York, says cyclical stocks have enjoyed a &quot;spectacular surge&quot; in the past two months or so.    The decline in the dollar, Mr. Fabbri said, immediately helped companies such as drug makers, who make a big part of their earnings overseas and whose overseas profits rise immediately in dollar terms when the dollar falls.    The effects of the dollar's fall against the Japanese yen and the West German mark take longer to reach such industries as steel, autos, fertilizers and farm machinery, he says. Those industries' profits improve gradually as their products become more competitive with other nations' goods in the U.S. and abroad.    It is these late-blooming cyclical companies that Mr. Fabbri says make the most sense now for those who are still buying stocks. But he is leery of putting money into the stock market at all these days.    At only one other time since World War II, Mr. Fabbri says, have stock prices been as high as they are now in relation to companies' book value, dividends and earnings. That time, he says, was the late 1960s. He also fears that interest rates might rise, in which case he says it would be &quot;very difficult for stocks to keep their current high values.&quot;    Suresh L. Bhirud, chief investment strategist for First Boston Corp., says investors would be wiser to invest in high-quality growth stocks now than in cyclicals.    &quot;The popular notion is that cyclicals have just started leading the market,&quot; he says. &quot;This is not true. Cyclicals have done as well as growth stocks since August 1982.&quot;    Mr. Bhirud says that &quot;on a near-term basis, it probably is too late&quot; to buy chemical, paper and forest-product stocks. &quot;It may not be too late to buy them on pullbacks,&quot; he says, but &quot;I wouldn't chase them here; I think they're pricey.&quot;    Blue-chip growth stocks such as drug companies and PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, he says, are cheap compared with the market as a whole. Coca-Cola, which has had an average return on equity of 22% the past five years, sells at about 22 times earnings. American Cyanamid, with half the return on equity, sells at 26 times earnings, he says.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Economic and market worries pestered investors like a swarm of mosquitoes as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 14.62 points from Thursday's record to close at 2186.87.    Still, advancing issues edged out decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, 804-782. And the American Stock Exchange index rose 1.75 to 316.73, its ninth consecutive record close.    Big Board volume of 184.1 million shares was well below the 256.7 million shares traded Thursday, the exchange's second busiest session ever.    William Marcus, a trader for Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette, said a statement by Sen. William Proxmire that the Federal Reserve Board was allowing the money supply to grow at a dangerous rate contributed to the industrials' decline. He also said the dollar's strong showing discouraged some foreign investors from putting money into the stock market and that profit-taking, program selling and uncertainty about a possible meeting of the Group of Five major industrial nations were other negative factors.    General Motors dropped 2 5/8 to 76 1/8 on volume of almost three million shares. GM Chairman Roger B. Smith said the company, which reported lower fourth-quarter earnings Thursday, has &quot;not been hinting&quot; at a possible stock buyback or dividend increase in recent meetings with securities analysts.    Cyclops gained 5 3/8 to 85 1/8 after saying it had received &quot;another serious expression of acquisition interest&quot; in addition to an offer last week from Audio-Video Affiliates.    ---             HOT CYCLICALS                         Price Change Stock                  Since Dec. 31* American Cyanamid          +14.6 Bethlehem Steel            +24.0 CSX                        +18.0 General Motors             + 15.3 International Paper        +24.8 Illinois Tool Works        +23.4 National Semiconductor     +35.3    *Through Friday.
