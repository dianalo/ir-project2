This time the &quot;cascade of misinformation, false headlines, half-truths, innuendo and misunderstanding of the law&quot; involves a complex web of international intrigue about whether or not Israel planned to bomb a proposed Iraqi oil pipeline. The shelf life of this hoped-for scandal may be shortened by the fact that the pipeline never was built.    The Los Angeles Times on Friday cited but didn't quote from a plan to bribe Shimon Peres, the former Israeli prime minister. &quot;Sources familiar with&quot; the investigation by independent counsel James McKay said a 1985 letter from lobbyist Robert Wallach had a reference to bribing Mr. Peres for a pledge that Israel wouldn't bomb the proposed pipeline from Iraq to the Jordanian port of Aqaba. Mr. McKay briefed White House officials on Friday. Mr. Meese took no action on the plan, but reports suggest Mr. McKay hinted that by not acting, Mr. Meese violated the Federal Corrupt Practices Act, which bars bribing of foreigners.    Israel denies that any bribe was paid and Mr. Meese said yesterday that the letter &quot;contains no reference to bribes or payoffs.&quot; Without a bribe, there's no violation of the anti-bribery law. Indeed, the proposed 540-mile, $1 billion pipeline from the Kirkuk oil fields to the Red Sea never got beyond Bechtel Group's blueprints.    Mr. Wallach apparently thought the project hinged on whether he could assure the Iraqis that Israel wouldn't do to the pipeline what its air force did to Iraq's nuclear reactor. To this end, in 1985 he tried and failed to use U.S. foreign-aid funds to Israel as a guarantee against damage to the pipeline. Israel says that by this time, before any alleged bribe proposal, it already had promised to leave the pipeline alone. The pipeline would have run through Jordan, after all, and Israel was conducting a diplomatic pas de deux with King Hussein. The pipeline plan collapsed of its own weight later that year.    More evidence could appear, but the most interesting aspect of the pipeline story to date is that it's a long way from the South Bronx to Aqaba. Mr. McKay was appointed to investigate Mr. Meese's dealings with Wedtech, the Bronx defense contractor with troubled minority set-aside grants. When Mr. Wallach was indicted in December for his lobbying, Mr. McKay cleared Mr. Meese of any wrongdoing relating to Wedtech. But Mr. McKay had permission from the panel of judges that oversees independent counsels to broaden his investigation of Mr. Meese beyond Wedtech, and the pipeline apparently is one of the loose ends.    This episode of the nonexistent bribe for the nonexistent pipeline should help convince Supreme Court justices of the wisdom of Judge Laurence Silberman's ruling that independent counsels are unconstitutional. Mr. McKay has just dragged into the mud the reputation of a former prime minister and current foreign minister of one of this country's closest allies and in the process spotlighted the political sensitivities of the volatile Middle East. The concept of prosecutorial discretion simply doesn't exist for these unconstitutional prosecutors, whatever the price to diplomacy, national security or the due-process rights of executive-branch officials.    Mr. Meese evidently never should have gotten involved with Mr. Wallach, a former law-school classmate. But his real crimes are that he is the closest adviser to President Reagan and has reclaimed the nation's courts from the liberal activists. This makes him the lightning rod for all sorts of opposition groups. We suspect, however, that this latest attack on Mr. Meese will be as successful as the rest have been in forcing him back to California. </TEXT></DOC>
