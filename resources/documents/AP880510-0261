We have lost 650,000 family farms in America over the past sevenyears. Workers throughout the United States _ auto workers, steelworkers, machinists, electricians, computer programmers _ have beendisplaced from jobs.   Farmers who fed the nation and fed the world know how to farm.Workers who have built the country know how to work. The problem isnot the farmer or the worker. They deserve our respect. The problemis that the structure doesn't work.   It's not a question of black people taking jobs from whitepeople; of women taking jobs from men.   When a plant closes without notice, when a farm is sold atauction, they pull out the plug. The lights go out. You can't usecolor or sex for a crutch in the dark. We all look remarkablysimilar in the dark.   Now we hear a lot about foreign workers _ Taiwanese, Koreans _taking our jobs. Many seek to blame foreigners for the loss ofjobs. But foreign workers without the right to organize and barelythe right to vote are not taking our jobs from us. U.S.multinational corporations are taking our jobs to them.   For example, in 1986, the United States imported 7 millionbicycles from Taiwan. There are no Taiwanese bicycle companies,only Schwinn and other companies. As the vice president of Schwinnstated, ``The competition from Taiwan is us.''   In 1986, the biggest exporter from Taiwan wasn't Taiwanese. Itwas General Electric, which owns RCA, which owns NBC, whichadvertises buy in America on television. General Electric took jobsto Taiwan not looking for better labor, but cheaper labor. TheAmerican worker can compete, but first we need to level the playingfield.   General Electric is one of the top 10 Pentagon contractors. From1981-84, it made $10 billion in profits. It paid nothing in taxes.In fact, it received a $100 million tax rebate. That's not fair.   It's not a question of white against black, or Asians againstAmericans, it's a question of barracudas and small fish.   Today, some 36,000 workers at Eastern Airlines are threatenedwith the loss of their jobs, unless they take 25-60 percent cuts inpay and benefits.   Why? Because Frank Lorenzo of Texas Air, a corporate barracuda,bought Eastern and now is prepared to dismember the company inorder to crush the union.   Who pays? Workers pay _ in wage cuts and lack of protection.Passengers pay. Lorenzo's airline conglomerate in recent months hasthe worst safety and service record in the industry. Communitiespay. If Eastern workers are displaced, the economy of Atlanta willbe depressed. Only the barracuda benefits.   We must change the incentives and stop the merger ofcorporations, the purging of workers and the submerging of oureconomy.   We need to level the playing field. We need to change theincentives to get corporations to reinvest in America, to retrainour workers, to reindustrialize our nation, to promote research anddevelopment.   We must join with Germany and Japan to lower interest rates andstimulate global growth.   We must relieve the debt which is crushing the Third World. Iftheir debt goes down, our trade goes up. If our trade goes up, ourdeficit goes down and our economy gets moving again.   We need to make the denial of basic labor rights an unfair tradepractice, so that workers abroad have the opportunity to gain fairwages and working conditions.   As their wages go up, they can afford to buy our goods, and ourtrade goes up. We all rise together. Either we will work to raisethe living conditions of workers in the Third World, or we willlower our conditions toward theirs.   We need to challenge the very premise of Reaganomics. Bush wasright when he said this was voodoo economics. But Bush is the onlyperson who can't quote himself.   Reagan assumed that the poor had too much money, the rich hadtoo little and that our insecurity came from a weak military. So heengaged in a reverse Robin Hood _ he took from the poor and gave tothe rich.   From 1977 to 1988, the bottom 10 percent ended up paying 20percent more in taxes and the top 1 percent are paying 20 percentless in taxes.   Essentially he gave the rich and the powerful a $400 billion taxcut.   The assumption was that they would invest in America and get oureconomy going again. Instead, they had a party. Mergingcorporations, speculating on junk bonds, playing in the stockmarket. Then on Oct. 19, the stock market crashed. Now they wantyou _ who weren't even invited to the party _ to pay for the party.That is not fair.   Reagan assumed that we felt insecure because our military wasweak, so he doubled the military budget in peacetime.   But he was wrong. Our military is strong _ the strongest in theworld _ it's our policy that's weak. Strong military, weak policy.   We are militarily superior in Central America, but our policy isweak. We are militarily superior in South Africa, but our policy isweak.   We have 26,000 nuclear warheads, 13,000 pointing at theRussians. Even President Reagan has come to understand that morenuclear weapons simply make us less secure.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
