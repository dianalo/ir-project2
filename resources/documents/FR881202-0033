This submission would constitute for the GeneralMotors Corporation's (GM) Janesville, Wisconsin, facility a temporary relaxationfrom Wisconsin's volatile organic compound (VOC) reasonably available controltechnology (RACT) regulations. This action is taken in response to a January13, 1987, submission from the State of Wisconsin.USEPA today is proposing to approve this as a SIP revision because (1)the GM facility is located in an ozone attainment area (the Clean Air Actdoes not require RACT level VOC control in areas that have always beendesignated attainment), and (2) approval of this proposed SIP revisionwill not increase the historical VOC emission level from this source. UnderUSEPA existing policy, however, no demonstration of attainment and maintenancewas required in the SIP for rural ozone attainment areas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments on this revision and on the proposed USEPA actionmust be received by January 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Copies of the SIP revision are available at the followingaddresses for review: (It is recommended that you telephone Uylaine E.McMahan, at (312) 886-6031, before visiting the Region V office.)<ITAG tagnum="15">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region V,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Air and Radiation Branch (5AR-26),</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">230 South Dearborn Street,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Chicago, Illinois 60604.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Bureau of Air Management,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">101 South Webster,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Madison, Wisconsin 53707.</ITAG>Comments on this proposed rule should be addressed to: (Please submit anoriginal and three copies, if possible.)

These operations are located at GM'sfacility in Janesville, Wisconsin, which has been designated as an attainment/unclassifiablearea for ozone, section 107(d) and andSection;81.350 of the Code of FederalRegulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">History of the Variance</ITAG>GM currently operates six coating systems at its B-O-C Group facility inJanesville, Wisconsin, which are subject to Natural Resources (NR) 154.13(4)(g),Wisconsin Administrative Code. Two of these coating systems, topcoatingand final repair, currently use coatings which exceed the limits containedin NR 154.13(4)(g). This rule limits the VOC content of topcoats and sprayprimers to 2.8 pounds per gallon of coating, excluding water, after December31, 1986, and limits the VOC content of final repair coatings to 4.8 poundsper gallon of coating, excluding water, after December 31, 1986.In lieu of these limits, the WDNR has issued a variance for the facility,subject to the following conditions:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. The following limits shall apply through December 1992, or untilthe J-Car production line is converted to a different automobile type productionline, whichever is sooner:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. 6.2 pounds of VOCs per gallon of coating, excluding water, froma blackout topcoat coating line.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. 5.2 pounds of VOCs per gallon of coating, excluding water, fromany other topcoat coating line.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. 6.5 pounds of VOCs per gallon of coating, excluding water, froma spot primer coating line.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. 6.5 pounds of VOCs per gallon of coating, excluding water, froma final repair coating line.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The facility shall keep records verifying compliance with the abovelimitations. These records shall be kept at the facility for a period of3 years and made available to WDNR officials, upon request.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. GM shall submit to the WDNR by December 31, 1989, a report detailingthe methods to be followed by the facility to achieve compliance with allRACT limitations by December 31, 1992.</ITAG>These limits would allow GM to continue to use the coatings currently usedon these lines.The variance issued by WDNR extends the compliance date to December 31,1992. As discussed further below, USEPA's policy provides that where asource in an attainment area is subject to RACT under an accommodativeSIP, and that source seeks a compliance date extension, the source musteither meet the RACT requirements of USEPA's August 7, 1986, compliancedate extension policy or the area will lose the accommodative SIP for theduration of the variance.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\An accommodative ozone SIP for areas classified as attainment/unclassifiablerequires RACT-level controls on existing sources, in lieu of requiringnew major sources of VOC to do preconstruction monitoring. This monitoringwould normally be required on new major sources in attainment/unclassifiableareas under USEPA's Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulations.The rationale behind this tradeoff is that the ``extra'' emission reductionsobtained from these additional RACT controls would be able to accommodatenew source growth in these attainment/unclassifiable areas.<ITAG tagnum="84">Compliance Date Extension</ITAG>In order for an area to retain its accommodative SIP, the State must demonstratethat it is implementing RACT as expeditiously as practicable. The currentguidance available for evaluting whether or not a compliance schedule isexpeditious is contained in an August 7, 1986, memorandum on compliancedate extensions in nonattainment areas. Therefore, although this sourceis not strictly subject to the requirements of the August 7, 1986, policy,USEPA is using the criteria contained in that policy to determine whetherthis compliance schedule is expeditious.However, GM has not demonstrated that its compliance schedule is as expeditiousas practicable. WDNR has maintained that an extension is justified becauseit is economically infeasible for GM to meet the SIP limits. However, GMis only proposing to delay the cost until the J-Car production line isconverted to a different type or until December 2, 1992, whichever is sooner.Therefore the variance will simply allow GM to delay these costs for control,rather than to reduce or eliminate them. Thus, the State has not demonstratedthat GM's compliance is expeditious. This rulemaking relaxes a stationary source RACT emission limitation inan area that has been designated as attainment/unclassified for ozone.Originally, this RACT limitation was imposed by the State, not to satisfyan ozone nonattainment SIP planning requirement, but rather to allow theState to have an accommodative SIP. This action, when promulgated, willremove the accommodative SIP for Rock County for as long as the relaxationis in place. This means that all new major VOC sources and major modificationsin this county must comply with all PSD monitoring requirements. Becausethis portion of the State's accommodative SIP never had any effect relativeto any designated ozone nonattainment area SIP, the RACT relaxation inthis notice will also have no effect on nonattainment areas_all sourceswishing to locate in nonattainment areas must continue to comply with theState's federally approved Part D new source review program. USEPA assumesthat the State would prefer to have this revision approved and cancel theaccommodative SIP for the duration of the variance. If the State does notwish to have the variance approved on this basis, it should so indicateduring the public comment period for this notice. Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator has certified that SIP approvalsdo not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. (See 46 FR 8709). USEPA is providing a 30-day comment period on this notice of proposed rulemaking.Public comments received on or before January 3, 1989 will be consideredin USEPA's final rulemaking. All comments will be available for inspectionduring normal business hours at the Region V office address provided atthe front of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 </ITAG>Air pollution control, Hydrocarbon, Intergovernmental relations, Ozone.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 19, 1987. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Valdas V.
