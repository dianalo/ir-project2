(Microsoft Corp.'s Steven Ballmer) (interview)andM;</TITLE><SUMMARY>Microsoft Corp's senior VP of systems software Steven Ballmerfeels that the MS-DOS 4.0 operating system failed because it usedmore RAM than version 3.3 and because it contained serious bugs.andO;DOS 5.0 was therefore designed to be as small as version 3.3 interms of memory usage.andP;  Ballmer argues that the company can offerbetter upgrade marketing and support to end users directly thanthird-party hardware vendors are capable of providing.andP;  Futureversions of MS-DOS may include more utilities in addition to DOS5.0's Mirror feature, which is licensed from Central PointSoftware.andP;  Version 3.1 of Windows is expected to ship by the endof 1991.andP;  Ballmer believes that the future of the company lieswith the Windows interface and providing applications for it.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Microsoft Corp.

 That puts him in a uniqueposition; Bill Gates may have the visions, but it's Ballmer who's at thesharp end of Windows, OS/2 -- and DOS 5.0.andM;Q There are a number of interesting aspects to DOS 5.0.andP;  For a start it's notDOS 4.0.andP;  What was wrong with DOS 4.0 that made so many people --particularly among OEMs -- prefer to stay with 3.3?andM;A There's some nice stuff in DOS 4.0.andP;  But it's the only release of DOS inwhich IBM actually did the development, if you will, on the extension to DOS3.3.andM;It suffered for two principal reasons when it initially came out: first, DOS4.0 was significantly bigger than DOS 3.3, taking up another 20Kb memory.andO;The second problem, frankly, was that the initial release had bugs in it.andP;  SoMicrosoft held back and responded with 4.01.andP;  There was still the problemthat it used more memory; the trade-off was that you got the Shell, butunfortunately that wasn't a compelling trade-off.andM;Q And DOS 5.0?andM;A It was clear to us that DOS 5.0 had to be a replacement for all earlier DOSreleases.andP;  To do that, DOS 5.0 had to focus on a number of things.andP;  Numberone was memory utilisation: it had to be as small as or smaller than DOS 3.3in typical cases.andP;  Then it had to have exciting end-user features.andM;We feel compelled with each new release of DOS to deliver immediate value toend-users.andP;  We don't want to say, &quot;This will have value to you when 10,000applications have been modified to take advantage of it.&quot;andM;Q The other interesting feature of DOS 5.0 is the way you'll be selling it toend-users.andM;A Our OEMs have always been excellent at shipping DOS with their hardware,but because they're in the hardware business they've never been aggressiveabout going back into the installed base and getting those people to upgrade.andO;So we decided to work hard on end-users -- not to offer DOS to new customers,because our OEMs do a good job there, but to offer the upgrade.andP;  We've put alot of effort into the technical side of the DOS 5.0 Upgrade product and nowwe'll put a lot of effort into marketing and support.andP;  We think we're a muchmore logical purveyor of the upgrade than the OEMs.andM;Q In terms of adding value, where did you draw the line?andP;  For instance,you've incorporated Central Point's Mirror feature, but there's a lot ofother good stuff in PC-Tools that you obviously decided not to include.andM;A People like Central Point, Symantec and Fifth Generation know we need toextend the end-user capabilities of DOS -- I've had extensive conversationsmyself with all three.andP;  Over time, we could choose to add more and moreend-user features.andM;Q Like a file transfer facility?andM;A Certainly our OEMs who sell portable machines have expressed a strongdesire for a DOS with file transfer functions built in.andP;  In the very nearfuture, we'll do a version of DOS 5.0 that can execute out of ROM for thosemanufacturers, and it's quite conceivable, shall we say, that this versionwill have file transfer.andM;Q Can you give a time-frame for the ROM DOS?andM;A Oh, less than six months.andM;Q What about the relationship between DOS and Windows?andP;  Or, to put it anotherway, is Windows ever going to incorporate DOS and become an operating systemitself?andM;A Today, Windows is an operating system.andP;  It has a loader and a memorymanager, it has processes and can launch processes, it has paging; it's anoperating system in every way except that it doesn't have a file system.andO;Windows leverages on the DOS file system, and also the DOS program loader.andO;So Windows is mostly an operating system, and it has been designedsynergistically with DOS to run alongside DOS.andM;Q Is there not, then, a duplication of functions?andM;A Let's take an example.andP;  The code for the DOS 5.0 task switching functionwas literally lifted from the Windows task switcher.andP;  We wanted to offer thatkind of facility to Windows users, but also to those users who didn't want tomake the step to graphical interfaces.andM;And DOS 5.0 isn't the end of the road -- DOS 6?andP;  We're working on that today.andO;A DOS 7?andP;  Probably, because there'll still be people who want it.andP;  DOS 8?andO;Well, maybe.andP;  But the point is we have as big a team working on DOS today aswe've ever had.andP;  And where possible, we won't reinvent the wheel.andM;Q But why not put the file system and other functions in Windows so that GUIusers can have a single operating system?andM;A Good question.andP;  There's a little bit more we can do, and we'll certainly beproviding OEMs with an installation program that installs DOS and Windows asif they were one product.andP;  But not all hardware vendors want to sell Windows,and not all end-users want to run Windows.andP;  And there's nothing we give uptechnically by offering Windows and DOS separately; any new features in DOSwill be designed totally to make sense in the context of what's going on inWindows.andM;Q Is there a target date you can give us for Windows 3.1?andM;A This year.andP;  Late this year.andM;Q What about Win-32?andM;A Windows-32 is not a product.andP;  It's a description of a set of programminginterfaces that'll be a part of Windows.andP;  A future release of Windows -- 3.5,4 or whatever -- will include a richer set of programmatic services, likethreads, Bezier curves, paths and correlation, for programs that wanted totake advantage of 32-bit architectures like the 386/486 and RISC.andM;Q What's the timescale for that?andM;A A product using Windows-32 will ship next year.andP;  You'll see a developer'stoolkit late this year.andP;  We'll be adding an additional mode to Windows, theNT -- New Technology -- mode.andP;  Enhanced mode runs on DOS and Real mode runson DOS; NT mode doesn't run on DOS.andP;  It's possible that the firstimplementation of Windows-32 would be NT-mode only.andM;Q Some major end-users have complained that Microsoft's strategy,particularly as enunciated in the last six months, isn't particularly clear.andO;Can you put it in a nutshell?andM;A I can, actually.andP;  It's simple -- Windows.andP;  We want to do Windows, we wantto do Windows applications, we want to deliver value to low-end customers aswell as the corporates, we think we know how to help stand-alone customersand network customers and we know that a lot of inter-operability is veryimportant.andM;For instance, our network software has to run on OS/2, on Unix, on VMS; theseare all LAN Manager platforms.andP;  So if you ask me what's fundamental, I'd sayWindows is fundamental and networking is fundamental.andM;Bill andlsqb;Gatesandrsqb; has talked about how we want to take Windows into 'informationat your fingertips' -- meaning presentation of information in the graphicalinterface, production of information from applications and accessinginformation over the network.andP;  That's the strategy and everything points inthat direction.andM;Q Where does OS/2 v3 fit in?andM;A People in Microsoft never really knew what to call that product.andP;  It has acore NT kernel that can run sub-systems for OS/2, Windows and Posix (which isUnix, but I guess ATandamp;T wouldn't allow us to call it that).andP;  Hopefully, OS/2v3 is a way for customers who want to be able to build a strategy aboutWindows but still have access to Posix and OS/2 applications; they can moveforward and do that.andP;  I guess what I'm telling you is it's all part of theWindows strategy.andM;Q When will this ship?andM;A Parts of it will be here next year.andM;Q As a separate product to Windows-NT?andM;A Probably, but we haven't decided.andP;  My current thinking is that we ought tohave two boxes, one just Windows and one for OS/2 v3 with all the pieces.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
