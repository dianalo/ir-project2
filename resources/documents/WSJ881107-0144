The office of the comptroller of the currency, which regulates national banks, plans this week to issue guidelines requiring more scrutiny of bank handling of all loans to finance highly leveraged takeovers, recapitalizations or management-led leveraged buy-outs. The office also is preparing soon to warn banks directly on the subject.    The moves are aimed at getting banks to scrutinize such loans and guard against providing too many of them, according to Wayne Rushton, deputy comptroller for multinational banks. Rather than impose arbitrary limits on such loans, Mr. Rushton said, the comptroller's office wants to encourage more banks to establish systems to carefully track their exposure to them. It also wants bank directors to develop policies limiting how much they lend to finance leveraged buy-outs and other highly leveraged transactions.    To improve their own monitoring of such loans, both the comptroller and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York also are moving to broaden their definitions of loans derived from highly leveraged transactions. The New York Fed's definition, which could be adopted by the Fed nationally for its examinations of state-chartered banks in the Federal Reserve system, is to be used by examiners &quot;to judge the overall level of risk in the institutions,&quot; said Peter Bakstansky, chief spokesman for the New York Fed.    The steps reflect growing concern among regulators about the risks to banks of debts created by highly leveraged transactions. They go beyond Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's statement last week that the central bank has warned banks to examine the prospects for leveraged buy-out loans &quot;under a range of economic and financial circumstances.&quot;    Tightened surveillance of these loans may eventually curb banks' willingness to make them. Some observers believe that signals from bank regulators already are making it harder to obtain financing for the huge leveraged buy-out bids for RJR Nabisco Inc. The expectation of scrutiny &quot;seems to be in the marketplace,&quot; said one person familiar with RJR financing efforts. &quot;If I'm a banker sitting there looking at this deal, I may start asking more questions.&quot;    That is possible, Mr. Rushton said. Though the comptroller's new examination guidelines haven't gone out yet, he said, &quot;it would be reasonable to assume&quot; that warnings to examiners have made them more sensitive to the risks involved in this sort of financing and &quot;they would share those concerns with the banks.&quot;    On the other hand, he noted, some banks may just be using regulators as a &quot;convenient excuse&quot; for not making loans that they don't like.    What seems sure, from Mr. Rushton's account, is that pressure to scrutinize such debt will be rising, at least on certain regional banks and other secondary buyers of highly leveraged debt.    The planned regulatory steps were prompted by findings of a survey last summer of the handling of highly leveraged debt by 11 multinational banks and five regional banks, Mr. Rushton said. Primarily, he said, the survey found that some regional banks were buying participations in these loans without scrutinizing them as closely as they should.    &quot;Some of them were saying that if it is good enough for Morgan (Guaranty Trust Co.), it is good enough for us,&quot; recalled Mr. Rushton.    In large leveraged buy-outs, big multinational banks like Morgan typically lead syndicates of banks that provide financing. Mr. Rushton said the lead banks appear to monitor their risk well. And they sell most of the debt to other banks and savings institutions.    But, Mr. Rushton said, &quot;We see in some cases participation loans where the purchasing bank relied entirely on the lead bank to maintain the documentation.&quot; The comptroller's office wants all banks to require the same documentation for subscription loans as for loans they originate themselves, Mr. Rushton said.    The comptroller also wants banks to watch their aggregate level of loans to highly leveraged companies. Many banks review their loan portfolios with an eye to whether they carry too much exposure to reverses in single industries or regions, Mr. Rushton noted. But few banks, he said, are monitoring whether their entire portfolios of loans to debt-burdened companies are too large.    Regulators are concerned about banks' overall exposure because companies with heavy debt loads are more vulnerable to recession. Such companies also are more exposed to interest rate increases since the loans typically have adjustable rates. </TEXT></DOC>
