The discussions will begin July 16 in Ottawa, said PrimeMinister Brian Mulroney and President Bush in a jointappearance following a brief meeting. President Bush said hedecided to go ahead with the talks even though Congress hasyet to pass a comprehensive Clean Air Act.</LP><TEXT>   The measure has passed both houses of Congress, anddiscussions to resolve differences between the two versionsbegin next week. Both versions include specific provisionsfor sulfur-dioxide emissions, which produce acid rain. In thepast, the reluctance of the U.S. to enter into suchdiscussions has been a sticking point in the generally warmrelations between the U.S. and Canada.   The treaty could include specific timetables for reducingacid-rain emissions, details for a joint research andmonitoring program and provisions for settling disputes.   Although the two leaders, meeting before the start of theeconomic summit of industrial nations, emphasized theprogress in resolving environmental issues, their talks cameamid lingering disagreement among the summit partners overenvironmental issues.   A draft copy of the environmental portion of the summitcommunique obtained by this newspaper shows that more thanone-third of the document remains in dispute, with pre-summitnegotiators unable to decide on such issues as whether globalclimate change is the most important environmental issuefacing humanity, or only one of several environmentalpriorities.   Summit leaders are also expected to discuss the importanceof preserving forest land and helping underdeveloped nationsprotect their environments while promoting economicdevelopment. But they disagree on how extensive thisassistance should be.</TEXT></DOC>
