One person was arrested before dawn in connection with thedisappearance, and that arrest led to several others, Batista said.The official said all in custody were Brazilians and that theirnames would be released later.   The money was part of a $52 million shipment from the FederalReserve Board in New York to the Central Bank of Argentina that wasstolen sometime between Feb. 4 and 5, said Marven Moss, a spokesmanfor Brink's Inc., based in Darien, Conn.   The money was shipped through Brink's on a routine flight aboarda commercial airliner in 13 bags and was made up of new,consecutively numbered $100 bills, Moss said.   The theft was discovered when the airliner arrived in BuenosAires and authorities found only 11 bags. The two missing bagscontained $8 million, Moss said.   ``Apparently what happened is that some people who were workingat the airport on a temporary basis took the bags and didn'trealize what they took. They thought it was (music) cassettes.Then, they get home and realize they have $8 million,'' Moss said.   Batista said the first break in the case came from the NarcoticsDepartment of the Rio de Janeiro state police.   ``Even though this case was, technically, not in the drug area,our people followed the tip, and the result was nearly totalsuccess,'' Batista said.   He said the missing dollars were traced to several Brazilianstates, where the thieves tried to exchange them, apparently forother American dollars or for foreign currency.   ``They didn't get a chance to spend much,'' the official said.   But Moss said Brazilian drug agents recovered virtually all thecash today during a drug but. Those who stole the money apparentlyused some of the cash to buy drugs, he said. The spokesman didn'thave any more details on the arrest, nor the exact amount of cashrecovered.   The recovered money belongs to Brink's, since its insurancerepaid the Federal Reserve Board for the theft, Moss said.   The $8 million heist was the largest in Brink's history, Mosssaid.</TEXT></DOC>
