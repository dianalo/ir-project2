Itwas recognized that the technical capability of the applicant is appropriate,as the result of examination. It was judged that the safety after thealteration of the installation of this reactor can be ensured. As theresult of examination on the new installation of a beta-gamma solid wasteincinerator, there was no problem in the maintenance of negative pressureand the safety against pressure rise in the system, the aseismatic design,the shielding design and the effect of exhaust to the environment. Asthe result of examination on the use of zirealoy 2 for the in-furnacetube of the shroud irradiation equipment, which is an experimental facilityof JMTR, it was confirmed that the mechanical design and the aseismaticdesign of the Zircaloy 2 in-furnace tube were adequate.
