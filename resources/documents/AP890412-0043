But guerrillas and Western diplomats in Kabul and Pakistan saidthe insurgents controlled major portions of the road connectingJalalabad and Kabul and that only helicopters flying by night canmake the 75-mile trip.   ``The regime's army is trying desperately to open theKabul-Jalalabad highway,'' the guerrillas' Afghan News Agency saidTuesday.   Also Tuesday, Pakistan agreed to allow the United Nations to setup permanent monitoring posts along its border with Afghanistan asrequested by Moscow and the Marxist government in Kabul.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said governmenttroops on Tuesday counterattacked 14,000 U.S.-backed guerrillasaround Jalalabad after the insurgents bombarded the city with18,000 shells and rockets Sunday and Monday.   Amani said troops had killed 318 guerrillas by sundown Tuesdayand lost just three government soldiers and five civilians. It wasnot possible to confirm the figures.   The capture of Jalalabad, 45 miles west of the border withPakistan where the guerrillas are based, would give the insurgentsan important foothold and provide their shadow government-in-exilewith its first seat inside Afghanistan.   Amani maintained that military convoys were still carrying foodand arms from Kabul to Jalalabad. He said the convoys were not seenleaving the capital because they travel at night. Civilians are notpermitted out of their houses during a curfew starting 11 p.m. andending 4 a.m.   Western diplomats in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad saidAfghan government forces were holding the city and its airport, butguerrilla rockets and artillery make it too dangerous forfixed-wing aircraft.   ``The only means of resupply remaining to regime forces is byhelicopter, although such flights are increasingly beinginterdicted by the resistance, even though most of them take placeat night,'' said one diplomat on condition of anonymity.   ``Indeed, most of the flights are kept busy bringing in medicalsupplies and evacuating casualties,'' the diplomat said.   At the United Nations on Tuesday, Pakistan agreed to permit U.N.military observers to set up permanent checkpoints along theAfghan-Pakistan border.   Kabul contends aid from Pakistan is flowing to the Afghan rebelsin violation of a U.N.-mediated accord on non-interference.   Pakistan denies the charges, but its agreement on the additionalcheckpoints is considered a minor concession. Diplomats said theydoubted it would alter the Afghan civil war.   The increased presence of U.N. military observers, who nownumber just 50 and are split between Kabul and Islamabad, hasrepeatedly been requested by Afghanistan and the Soviet Union.   Pakistan, the United States, China and several Moslem countriesare the main backers of the guerrillas, who began fighting after acommunist coup in 1978. Soviet military forces entered the war in1979 and completed a U.N.-negotiated withdrawal Feb. 15.</TEXT></DOC>
