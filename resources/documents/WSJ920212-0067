This 30-year-old satellite company is losing theregulatory buffers that have protected it from rivals, andfaces increasing challenges from fiber-optic technology. Butas the traffic of phone calls, faxes and computer databouncing off satellites explodes, there is ample room forComsat to grow despite competition.</LP><TEXT>   Bruce Crockett, who takes over this month as Comsat'schief executive officer, is facing the prospect ofrough-and-tumble competition with equanimity and plans tosteer a simple course for this company-in-transition. &quot;Wedon't have to be very fancy,&quot; says the 55-year-old Mr.Crockett, who has been president since April. &quot;I'm just goingto keep the divisions on track and manage growth.&quot;   With satellite communications traffic swelling 15% to 20%a year and satellite costs coming down, &quot;I don't know of anybetter business,&quot; says James McCabe, an analyst with NomuraResearch Institute in New York. Comsat estimates 1991 revenuetotaled more than $500 million, up 9% from 1990, and up 39%from four years ago.   Mr. Crockett has estimated that Comsat will post net ofabout $43.5 million, or $2.30 a share, for all of 1991,including a $40 million to $45 million pretax charge againstfourth-quarter earnings for post-retirement employee healthbenefits. Accounting rules require companies to take thesecharges by the end of 1992.   The company's experience in nonregulated areas has beenfar from successful, as Mr. Crockett knows. During his 12years at this one-time monopoly, he has seen the companystumble into a couple of costly diversifications, including astake in the Denver Nuggets basketball team. Now Comsat hasshed most of these and is focusing on its basic satelliteoperations.   It is a business that Comsat, based in Washington, helpedcreate but no longer has all to itself. Formed in 1963 to setup and run a global communications satellite system, Comsatstill owns 23% of that system, a 119-country consortiumcalled Intelsat. Later it formed the Inmarsat group toprovide communications to ships.   In the past 10 years, Comsat has been grappling withderegulation and the growing challenge from fiber optics asan alternative technology. The Federal CommunicationsCommission a few years ago dropped the requirement thatlimited the volume of long-distance traffic that could becarried by fiber-optic cables. Last November, regulatorsallowed private satellite companies more access to the publictelephone network; such companies already can compete toprovide broadcast and digital services. And in 1997, privatesatellite companies probably will be allowed to supplysatellite links for long-distance calls from the U.S., aservice that makes up the largest chunk of Comsat's business.   But there seems to be enough business to go around. &quot;Allthis means is that Comsat could lose market share, but it'sin a market that's growing,&quot; says George R. Dellinger, ananalyst with County Natwest USA in Washington. Mr. Dellingerpredicts Comsat's earnings will grow about 12% annuallythrough the 1990s.   In long-distance voice communications, which accounts forabout a third of the company's revenue, Comsat has cut ratesto entice American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., MCICommunications Corp. and the U.S. Sprint unit of UnitedTelecommunications Corp. into extending long-term contracts.Rates have dropped 70% over the last three years, Mr.Crockett says. While these customers are also Comsat'sfiberoptic rivals, they use satellites to reach places thataren't wired and as back-up for any disruptions onfiber-optic lines.   The prospect of competition may make the FCC more likelyto grant Comsat's request for looser regulation in thelong-distance business, analysts say. Comsat recentlyproposed to replace traditional rate-based regulation with aprice ceiling, but no limit on profits. Analysts say thiswill put Comsat's revenue growth closer to usage growth.Comsat has had to cut rates to stay within the specified rateof return.   Despite these pluses, &quot;we have to run real fast just tokeep our revenue standing still&quot; in the fixed-satellitebusiness, which includes long-distance service, Mr. Crockettsays. &quot;If we can grow that business 3% a year in terms ofrevenue, we're doing a good job.&quot;   The real engine of Comsat's growth is its mobilecommunications operation, which sends signals to mobileantennas. Built only in the last 10 years, it began byproviding satellite services to offshore oil platforms andspread to ships and mobile phones. Because Comsat already hascompetition from other members of the Inmarsat consortium,the business is more loosely regulated. Mr. Crockettestimates 1991 revenue at $125 million, up from $25 millionin 1985.   The mobile communications operation is &quot;a jewel of abusiness&quot; that is expected to grow 30% a year, says Mr.Dellinger of County Natwest. Mr. Crockett says mobilecommunications could account for more than half of revenuesby mid-1990, compared with 25% today.   The bulk of this enterprise is providing telephone anddata communications services to ships. But the product withthe most promise is satellite service to airlines, a businessthat began only in 1990 but is expected to boom once airlinesstep up orders of new aircraft equipped to received suchsignals. The system would be used for navigation as well asair-to-ground communications.   Mr. Crockett concedes that Comsat, a company more knownfor engineers, lobbyists and lawyers rather than MBAs, mustbecome more customer-oriented. Since he was named presidentin April 1991, he has sought to hire and promote executiveswith more experience in nonregulated businesses.   As for the touchy issue of Comsat's diversification, thecompany has been looking for buyers for Video Enterprises,the remaining business outside of its core operations. ButMr. Crockett says he is in no hurry to sell.   Video Enterprises, which provides video entertainment tohotels, generally has been losing money since 1987. In 1990,it took a $97.6 million pretax charge to cover the write-downof assets and layoffs, but is still likely to report a lossfor 1991. The division's head, Robert Wussler, resigned lastmonth, citing Comsat's refusal to move into the homepay-per-view market.   The company recently acquired a $14 million stake in OnCommand Video Corp., which provides pay-per-view service toluxury hotels. Mr. Crockett says this should help VideoEnterprises broaden its market.   Comsat also holds a 63% stake in the loss-plagued DenverNuggets, which Video Enterprises bought to participate insports programming. Mr. Crockett says the first priority isto improve management. &quot;Once there's stability there, we canconsider what to do.&quot;   Mr. Crockett points to the decision not to pursue the homepay-per-view market as a sign of Comsat's new diversificationphilosophy. He doesn't rule out future diversification, butsays any such forays won't be capital intensive and won't betechnology driven, the main flaws of its diversificationfollies, which included satellite manufacturing andbroadcasting. &quot;We were trying to force-fit satellites tocertain applications and they were not always the bestsolution.&quot;   That could be good news to investors, who have seen thecompany's earnings drained by those blunders. But, says Mr.Dellinger, &quot;the burden is on the company and management toshow that they can diversify profitably.&quot;   ---                   Comsat by the Numbers                                                                                                                            The Fundamentals                                                                                                                          In millions of dollars                                                                                                                                               1990        1989                                                                                                          SALES                              $456.80     $411.50   NET INCOME (Loss)                  ($16.30)*    $62.50   DIVIDENDS PER SHARE                 ($0.87)*     $3.00                                                                                                          MAJOR PRODUCT LINES:                                                                                                          Satellite voice, data and video transmissions to longdistance carriers; television networks and corporatecustomers; satellite telephone and data service to ships;aircraft and mobile phones; pay-per-view video service tohotel industry; and consulting and satellite technologyservices.
