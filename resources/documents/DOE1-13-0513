In the authors work, in which theyassume the database query language is SOL, they present methods for respondingwith appropriate answers to null value responses. To do so they use aknowledge base based on RM/T. The advantages of this approach are described.To demonstrate the utility of the knowledge base, a simple knowledgebase is constructed. A detailed algorithm is given to provide additionalinformation when a null answer is returned.</TEXT></DOC>
