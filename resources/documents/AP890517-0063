But ballistic missiles with nuclear capabilities haveproliferated, ``one of the most disturbing developments'' of recentyears, said Walter Stuetzle, director of the StockholmInternational Peace Research Institute.   Seventeen Third World nations have deployed ballistic missilesand at least seven more have them or are trying to acquire them,the institute said in its 1988 yearbook.   Speaking at a news conference, Stuetzle said ``no effectivemechanism has been established to control this development.''   But the institute's report also said the number of wars fellfrom 33 to 28 and some appeared close to a resolution by year's end.   ``There was a clear break in the pattern of a constant increasein the number of major conflicts with which the world had grownaccustomed during the 1980s,'' the report says.   Since World War II, more than 160 regional and civil wars _defined as involving more than 1,000 deaths _ have been fought, the530-page annual report says.   The institute, an independent group funded mostly by the Swedishparliament, monitors developments in weapons trading and armscontrol.   Stuetzle, a former West German undersecretary of defense, wrotein the report that ``1988 has seen remarkable progress towards apotentially more peaceful world,'' and that relations between thetwo superpowers may determine whether existing conflicts can besettled.   But at today's news conference, Stuetzle faulted the UnitedStates for failing to agree to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev'scall for nuclear arms talks.   ``In the last 12 months we have witnessed a tremendous series ofinitiatives by President Gorbachev in the fields of arms controland reduction,'' he said.   ``I think it's a great tragedy that with a Gorbachev in theKremlin, there is no J.F. Kennedy in the White House,'' he said,referring to Kennedy's call to never fear negotiations.   Agreements were reached to end hostilities in the Iran-Iraq war,the conflict between Ethiopia and Somalia, the war between Chad andLibya and in the conflicts in Angola and Namibia.   Moscow began withdrawing troops from Aghanistan, Vietnamannounced it would pull out of Cambodia and fighting subsided inNicaragua, where U.S.-backed rebels appear to be giving up theirfight against the leftist government.   Also, tensions eased between India and Pakistan, between Laosand Thailand and in internal disputes in Uganda.   However, civil wars escalated in Afghanistan, Somalia, Ethiopiaand Burma and Iraq used chemical weapons against its Kurdishminority, the report said.   Fighting continued in Sri Lanka and the Palestinian uprisingworsened in the Israeli-occupied territories. Fighting intensifiedin southern Sudan and the Philippines, it said.   The United States cut real military spending for the third yearin a row, NATO defense spending was down 3 percent from 1987 andspending by the Warsaw Pact countries was unchanged, it said. TheSoviet Union and China were believed to have trimmed spending.   Worldwide trade in conventional arms totaled $34 billion,measured in 1985 prices, down slightly from the previous year'srecord figure, the report says.   The share bought by Third World countries dropped from 66percent in 1986 to 61.4 percent last year.   The report says the U.S. share of the global arms market was 28percent, and the Soviets took 38 percent. India was the biggestThird World buyer last year, followed by Iraq, North Korea, andSaudi Arabia, the report says.</TEXT></DOC>
