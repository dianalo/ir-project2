The instrument design utilizes an alpha/beta particle-sensitiveplastic scintillation fiber to detect and measure internally depositedradionuclides that cannot be suitably assayed using other techniques.Scintillations are optically guided to a photomultiplier for detection.The computerized electronics provides preamplification, amplification,analog-to-digital conversion and storage in a multi-channel analyzer.The microcomputer provides data storage, retrieval, and graphical display.Alpha detection and attenuation were conducted with a calibrated P{sub0}-210 source. Ten scintillation fibers of varying diameters (0.5--3mm) and properties were tested to determine their relative sensitivityfor alpha particle detection as a function of distance of the sourceto the photomultiplier tube. The sensitivity in counts per minute wasapproximately proportional to the diameter of the fiber for samples ofthe same composition and manufacturer. 20 refs., 8 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
