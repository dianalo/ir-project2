Experts who try to quantify pleasure in personal-injurysuits have helped plaintiffs win some multimillion damageawards in the past several years. But now judges arebeginning to question whether the area of expertise -- usedto compute so-called hedonic damages -- is reliable enough toadmit in court.</LP><TEXT>   Last month, a federal judge refused to let Chicagoeconomist Stanley V. Smith, the father of hedonics, apply histheory in a case involving a kindergarten student who wasleft severely brain-damaged in a taxicab accident. Mr. Smithwas prepared to calculate the monetary value of the boy's joyof living and, consequently, how much he and his parentsshould be compensated for his loss of those pleasures.   But Judge James B. Zagel nixed that approach, ruling thatno economist's models for arriving at such dollar amounts arescientifically reliable. Until they are, the judge said, theyshould be regarded skeptically.   &quot;Courts will always lag behind scientists as far asscience is concerned,&quot; Judge Zagel wrote. &quot;The risk tojustice from pseudo-science is substantial, and we avoid thisrisk by requiring some showing of reliability and validity,either by direct proof or by proof of acceptance by theappropriate scientific community.&quot;   That proof is lacking in hedonics, he concluded. Besides,he added, juries already award damages for similarlysubjective calculations, such as pain and suffering and thediminished ability to enjoy life. Experts in the value oflife's pleasures, the judge ruled, &quot;are no more expert thanthe jurors.&quot;   The ruling is one of nine in Illinois -- four of them inCook County Circuit Court in Chicago and two in federal courtin Chicago -- to reject testimony on hedonic damages inpersonal injury cases, said Michael Ortyl, who helped defendthe most recent case. It was considered a major victory forthe insurance industry, which regards Mr. Smith's theory asthreatening new grounds for excessive damage awards.   Mr. Smith countered that testimony on hedonic damages hasbeen allowed in federal and state courts in 13 states anddisallowed in only three -- Minnesota, Wisconsin andIllinois. Even in those three states, different courts haveruled opposite ways.   However, Mr. Smith conceded, &quot;I think there have beensetbacks.&quot;   ---   BOESKY SETTLEMENT of shareholder suits gets courtapproval.   U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack in New York affirmed asettlement that allows the payment of $46.8 million toinvestors who sustained losses from former stock speculatorIvan F. Boesky's allegedly illegal securities transactions.   The approval clears the way for investors to begincollecting damages from the $45 million fund set up by theSecurities and Exchange Commission in 1987 with money turnedover by Mr. Boesky. The remaining $1.8 million wascontributed to the restitution fund by Cambrian andamp; GeneralSecurities PLC, a British investment fund once controlled byMr. Boesky. About 80,000 investors have filed claims so far,lawyers said.   Nearly $30 million will be distributed among &quot;first tier&quot;claimants. These are investors who claimed losses from Mr.Boesky's alleged insider trading on tips from Dennis Levine,a former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. investment banker. Thosetransactions involve trading in 1985 and 1986 in thesecurities of Nabisco Brands Inc., Houston Natural Gas Corp.,General Foods Corp., American Natural Resources Co., UnionCarbide Corp. and FMC Corp.   The rest of the fund will be used to pay &quot;second tier&quot;claims from investors in the securities of several othercompanies allegedly manipulated in Boesky transactions. Whilethe settlement outlines a distribution plan for thefirst-tier claimants, the allocation of the second-tier fundsis yet to be decided.   The settlement also calls for a guaranteed contribution of$6.5 million from Boesky-related defendants, such as hisformer limited partnerships, in the event that the $46.8million doesn't satisfy all legitimate claims.   In approving the settlement, in Manhattan federal courtyesterday, Judge Pollack said, &quot;The complexities, parties,claims, classes, subclasses, and securities transactions&quot; inthis case made it &quot;unique in every respect and unprecedentedin securities legislation.&quot;   The litigation began in 1987 shortly after Mr. Boeskypleaded guilty to insider trading.   ---   INDIVIDUALS CAN'T BE HELD more than 24 hours withouthearing, court rules.   New York state's top court ruled that people arrestedwithout a warrant in Manhattan must be brought before a judgeand allowed to arrange for bail within 24 hours or bereleased.   When the case was filed last year, the process averaged 38hours, said Robert Baum of the Legal Aid Society, whichbrought the case. Mr. Baum said the lawsuit and a 1989 reportof arrest procedures in New York City have helped lower theaverage time to 24-26 hours.   Pre-arraignment detention, often in crowded and dangerousholding pens, is a national issue. Most other major urbanareas, including Houston, Chicago and the District ofColumbia, require prisoners to be processed within 24 hours.The U.S. Supreme Court is now considering a case involvingRiverside County, Calif., in which a federal appeals courtset a 36-hour limit.   Among the complainants in the Manhattan case was a man whowas arrested for selling umbrellas without a license and notprocessed for more than three days. While the lawsuitconcerns only Manhattan, the appeals panel said that it wasmaking its decision in light of the problems in urban centersacross the state.   Victor Kovner, the city's top lawyer, said Mayor DavidDinkins's administration has already sped up the arraignmentprocess enormously and is committed to abiding by the 24-hourlimit.   ---   COPYRIGHT OF EARLY RECORDINGS belongs to rock band, courtrules.   U.S. District Judge Joseph Tauro of Boston decided thatthe rhythm and blues band George Thorogood andamp; the Destroyersowns the copyrights to tapes the band made at two recordingsessions in 1976. The court blocked John Forward, a recordcollector, from releasing the tapes commercially.   Gordon Katz, a Boston lawyer for the band, said the rulingwill help protect musicians against unauthorized release andsale of recordings made before a band becomes well-known.   In the Thorogood case, Mr. Forward befriended themusicians in the 1970s and arranged for the band's recordingsessions in the hopes of getting the band a record contract.Mr. Forward retained the only copies of the tapes, which werenever released to the public.   In the decision, Judge Tauro ruled that although Mr.Forward arranged for the recording sessions, he made nomusical or artistic contribution to the tapes. The judge saidthat because Mr. Forward provided no significant creativecontribution, he couldn't be considered a joint author andthus he wasn't a holder of the common law copyright.   Kenneth Goldberg, a Lynnfield, Mass., lawyer for Mr.Forward, said his client plans to appeal the decision.&quot;According to Mr. Forward, he created or helped create thestyle of music Mr. Thorogood performed on these tapes andwhich later became Mr. Thorogood's hallmark,&quot; Mr. Goldbergsaid.   ---   NOTED: Dennis J. Drebsky, formerly a partner at Skadden,Arps, Slate, Meagher andamp; Flom, joined Rogers andamp; Wells to headits bankruptcy and restructuring group, based in New York.Mr. Drebsky said his new firm, which currently has about adozen lawyers working primarily on bankruptcy matters, plansto expand its practice in the area.</TEXT></DOC>
