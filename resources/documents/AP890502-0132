The statement by spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler came amid anintensification of efforts by the Vietnamese-backed government inCambodia and non-communist rebel forces to reach an accommodationon the shape of a future government.   With Vietnam planning to withdraw the remainder of its forcesfrom Cambodia by this September, the United States has becomeincreasingly concerned about the possibility that the Khmer Rougecould regain power there.   The Khmer Rouge, the most militarily powerful of the threeresistance forces, are estimated to have killed more than onemillion Cambodians during their 3{ years in power in the late 1970s.   ``The United States is totally opposed to a return to dominancein Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.   ``We believe that the best means to achieve this goal would beacceptance by all parties of a comprehensive settlement agreementunder which the Cambodian people were able to determine their ownfuture through a process of free choice.''   She reaffirmed the U.S. view that an interim coalitiongovernment should be formed to organize elections and that PrinceSihanouk, the former head of state, is a logical leader of such anarrangement.   She said that whether the Khmer Rouge, minus discredited leaderssuch as Pol Pot, are permitted to participate in such an interimgovernment is one thing the Cambodian factions themselves will haveto decide.   But, she said, that American ability to work with any futureCambodian government ``would be related to the level of Khmer Rougeparticipation in that government.''   Ms. Tutwiler said it is imperative to have a settlement thatincludes effective safeguards to keep the Khmer Rouge fromdominating Cambodia once more.   ``We are convinced that in free and fair elections, theCambodian people would reject the Khmer Rouge,'' she said.   As part of stepped-up U.S. diplomacy in the region, VicePresident Dan Quayle met on Monday with Sihanouk during a visit toIndonesia.   Sihanouk said later, after a meeting with Indonesian PresidentSuharto, said he was optimistic a settlement was within reach.   The non-communist resistance is eager to reach a politicalsettlement with the Vietnamese-backed government before thewithdrawal of the Vietnamese forces. Without an agreement, there isconcern that Khmer Rouge will regain power in Phnom Penh because oftheir superior military capability.   The Bush administration has reflected its concern by consideringfor the first time the provision of military aid to the twonon-communist factions.</TEXT></DOC>
