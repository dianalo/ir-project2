Last week, the House of Representatives failed topass a-very flawed-package of financial regulation reforms.The Senate is now struggling with its own package of reforms,while the House is getting ready for a second vote on arevised version of its earlier proposal. The administration'soriginal proposal in February and the bill that emerged fromthe House Banking Committee in June were imperfect, but wereessentially right. Since that time, the effort to reform thefinancial system has faltered.   At the end of the day, the combination of specialinterests and the difficulty of getting U.S. government towork has led to the near collapse of the effort to reformfundamentally the regulation of banks. At this moment, theonly real reform that still has a possibility of enactment isthe proposal to permit national interstate branching. Eventhis reform is threatened by special interests trying to holdinterstate branching reform hostage to a roll-back ofexisting securities and insurance powers of banks.</LP><TEXT>   Indeed, it appears quite possible that the only bankinglaw we will see this year will be a &quot;narrow&quot; law that islimited to increasing the supervision and regulation of banksand to recapitalizing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.   The great loser from this political morass is the nation.The continuing weakness in the economy is clearly linked toweakness in the banking system. In turn, the weakness in thebanking system is directly linked to a regulatory structurethat has distorted market and economic forces.   Discussions of whether the country should rely on&quot;regulation&quot; or on &quot;markets&quot; miss the point. Hundreds ofyears of history demonstrate that unregulated financialmarkets self-destruct. On the other hand, in today's world,market, economic and competitive forces are too powerful tocontrol. The current system is bankrupt precisely because ittries to use regulation to control market forces that arebeyond its control and, in the process, has createddestructive flaws in the marketplace.   Attempts to impose overly rigid, rule-based, &quot;firewalls&quot;between banks and their holding company activities take theregulatory system down the wrong path. The U.S. needs insteadto adopt a fundamentally different approach: Rather thantrying to control market, economic, and competitive forces,they must be made to work better. This means eliminating theflaws in today's system; in particular, it means real reformof the deposit insurance system.   Instead, Congress is heading in exactly the oppositedirection. Rather than reforming the deposit insurancesystem, it is increasing the power of regulators andexaminers to determine who will get credit and who will not.Indeed, by the time the full magnitude of the loan lossesfrom commercial real estate have been realized, it is quitepossible that 40% or more of the nation's deposits will be inthe hands of banks and thrifts that will be undercapitalizedunder the capital zones defined by the new &quot;narrow&quot; law. And,once this law is passed, how these deposits will be lent willbe as much or more under the control of regulators than underthe control of management and shareholders.   Worse, instead of all market participants playing by thesame rules, each participant will continue to work to findways to exploit the particular rules that apply to them. Forexample, strong banks will continue to search for &quot;loopholes&quot;in the Glass-Steagall Act and to find friendly states willingto let them do things not permitted by national law.Simultaneously, non-bank financial firms will continue tosell bank-like products (i.e, money market mutual funds,credit cards, home equity loans, etc.) with a different setof rules. In other words, far from serving to make market,economic and competitive forces work better, a purely&quot;narrow&quot; reform will take the American financial systemfarther down the path of distorting those forces. Instead ofgaining competitive advantage from the quality of theirservice, companies will gain advantage by exploiting thespecial set of rules that apply to them.   It is for this reason that it is futile for lawmakers tohope that the issue of finacial reform will go away. Untilthe regulation of banks is improved, the law will continue todestroy their ability to perform their role in society.Without fundamental reform of the deposit insurance systemand modernization of the regulatory system, the long-termhealth and profitability of the banking system will not berestored. And only by restoring health and profitability willthe nation regain confidence in its banks and bankers regainconfidence in themselves. Bankers need confidence in theirown institutions and in the banking system as a whole, ifthey are to have the courage to finance economic recovery andlong-term growth.   For this reason, it is important that interstate bankingand branch reform be part of this year's law. The potentialcost savings from consolidation of U.S. banks could amount to$10 billion or more in pretax savings -- in an industry thatearned only $24.5 billion before taxes in 1990, with a returnon equity of less than 8%.   This economic consolidation is now already underway. To alarge extent consolidation has been triggered by anticipationthat meaningful interstate reform was coming. Banks havealready announced projected cost savings, based onanticipated savings from consolidation and interstatebranching, of more than $3.2 billion from just 10 largemergers.   Assuming that interstate branching reform is adopted tohelp achieve these savings, it will increase the ability ofbanks to raise the capital they need. The capital createdfrom these savings over a 5-year period could conservativelysupport more than $600 billion in new lending. Indeed,without such improvements in earnings, it will be difficultto get the kind of bank lending needed to get the economymoving again.   From the taxpayer's perspective, it would be helpful toget genuine interstate banking and branching reform as soonas possible. Any amendments that delay the effective date ormake the process more cumbersome and irrational will onlydelay the realization of savings that will help torecapitalize the industry and restore its profitability. Andrestored profitability is the best defense against a taxpayerbailout of the deposit insurance fund.   The administration and Congress should be seeking toeliminate overcapacity and weak banks from the system asrapidly as possible. True interstate banking and branchingreform will help to jump-start this important process.Failure to encourage rapid cost rationalization in thebanking industry will likely result in a higher cost, notonly to the deposit insurance fund, but potentially to theAmerican taxpayer as well. Simply passing a bill thatincreases supervision and that recapitalizes the FDIC,without meaningful reform of interstate banking laws, wouldbe a disservice to well run banks, the economy and the publicat large.   ---   Mr. Bryan is a director in the New York office of McKinseyandamp; Co.</TEXT></DOC>
