The rebels said Mrs. Aquino ``cannot cover up the basic truththat the Filipino nation remains in deep crisis, that U.S. controland interference continue to fetter national development, that thenation is being ever more polarized along class and political lines.   ``Direct armed intervention by American troops is a distinctpossibility _ meaning a much bloodier war for the Filipino people _should the U.S. imperialists judge that the Aquino regime can nolonger stop the general advance of the people's democraticrevolution and protect strategic American interests.''
