A University of California, San Francisco report, to be publishedFriday in the journal Science, says test tube studies prove that thehuman immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, can use antibodiesthat normally fight infection to actually cause more AIDS infection.   Instead of helping to kill the virus, Dr. Jay A. Levy, a UCSFresearcher, said, these type of antibodies provide AIDS viruses witha second way to invade and infect cells.   He said that any vaccine against AIDS must be designed to notcause the body to make these so-called ``enhancing antibodies.''   ``That's our big warning,'' he said.   Levy said the laboratory studies used antibodies derived fromAIDS patients. He said that like all antibodies, these have aprotein on the surface called Fc.   Normally, an antibody uses this protein to adhere to acorresponding protein, called the Fc receptor, on the surface ofmacrophages, which are among the white blood cells in the body'simmune system. When fighting infection, the antibody helps themacrophage search out and destroy bacteria or viruses in the body.   But Levy said the AIDS virus is able to stick to the Fc proteinon one type of antibody and hitch a ride to a macrophage. When theantibody locks to the Fc receptor, the virus slips inside themacrophage and takes control. The virus turns the macrophage into avirus-making factory that circulates in the body, throwing off newviruses that then continue the process.   ``The enhancing antibody allows the virus to enter cells that itnormally would not,'' said Levy. ``This is an important alternateroute for infection. The macrophage is a major cell in the body'simmune system.''   Previously, it was well-known that the AIDS virus infectedanother immune cell, the lymphocyte or T-cell, by locking onto asurface protein called the CD4 receptor.   The new study shows that the virus can use both the Fc and theCD4 receptor to infect cells and turn them into virus-makingfactories.   Some experimental AIDS treatments now under way are trying tocontrol the infection with injections of a decoy CD4 protein. Thetheory is that AIDS virus would lock onto this decoy instead of theCD4 that is actually on a T-cell surface.   But Levy said the new study shows that blocking the CD4 receptorwill not be enough to halt spread in the body of the AIDS virus.   ``We would have to block both the CD4 and Fc receptors for theblocking protein strategy to work,'' said Levy. The T-cell, he said,also has Fc receptors.   To produce an AIDS vaccine, Levy said researchers are going tohave to find which protein in the AIDS virus causes the body toproduce the infection-enhancing antibody. That protein then would beremoved from any candidate AIDS vaccine, he said.   ``Otherwise, we could be immunizing people with a viralprotein,'' he said.   Co-researchers in the study with Levy were Jacques Homsy, MiaMeyer and Masatoshi Tateno, all of UCSF, and Sarah Clarkson of SanFrancisco General Hospital.   The study was published in Science, the journal of the AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science.</TEXT></DOC>
