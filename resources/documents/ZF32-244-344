Some industry observers doubt that theproduct will be widely accepted because it lacks Intel'swell-documented safety margins; many microcomputer makers say theywill not use Icejet because it runs the processor at a speedgreater than that for which Intel rates it.andP;  A few vendors expressmild interest, and Everex managers call the Icecap technology a'useful development device.' The Icejet-486 with 1Mbyte of RAMcosts $3,290 in quantities of 100.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Velox Computer Technology Inc.
