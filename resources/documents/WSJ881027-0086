The Federated offering is one of this year's biggest junk bond issues. Its postponement raises questions about the willingness of investors to buy securities of certain highly leveraged buyouts -- just as Wall Street has embarked on a new round of even bigger, highly leveraged deals.    The Federated bonds, which were scheduled to be priced and sold this week, probably will be restructured with new financial terms that could significantly increase Federated's borrowing costs, traders and investment bankers familiar with the offering said. On Monday, the First Boston group significantly boosted yields on most of the bonds in an unsuccessful attempt to drum up sufficient buyers.    A First Boston spokesman late yesterday confirmed reports by bond traders that the Federated offering had been pulled from the market. &quot;We are having discussions with our client,&quot; the spokesman said.    The Federated offering is supposed to provide long-term financing for last May's $6.6 billion acquisition of Federated by Campeau Corp. Just over a year earlier, Campeau, a Canadian real estate and retailing concern, began building its U.S. retailing empire by acquiring Allied Stores Corp. for $3.6 billion.    A mountain of debt was built up in the process, creating concern among many buyers of junk bonds. A Campeau spokesman declined to comment yesterday.    To complete Campeau's acquisition of Federated, First Boston, PaineWebber Inc. and Dillon, Read andamp; Co. made a $1.1 billion loan to Campeau. The proceeds from the planned junk bond sale, if it is completed, will pay off this so-called bridge loan.    In exchange for risking their capital in the bridge loan and underwriting the $1.15 billion of junk bonds, the securities firms were expected to earn fees of about $70 million. First Boston, as financial adviser to Campeau, earned an additional fee of nearly $19 million.    The underwriters encountered resistance from investors partly because the Federated bonds were competing with higher-yielding junk bonds issued by Allied Stores in March 1987, and because many investors are concerned about the outlook for the department store industry. The group led by First Boston twice found it necessary to raise the yields on the bonds because of investor skittishness about the offering.    Last week, for instance, First Boston said Federated's planned eight-year reset notes would yield about 13.25%; its six-year non-call notes about 14%; and its 12-year debentures 14.75%. The yields on the latter two issues already had been increased 0.25 percentage point because of a $6 billion supply of new high-yield bonds hitting the market in October and November. Then, earlier this week First Boston raised the yields on the six-year and 12-year issues to 14.5% and 15.5%, respectively, before pulling the entire offering from the market.    Allied, which has more than $1 billion of junk bonds and preferred stock outstanding, was part of Federated's problem. Allied's 11 1/2% bonds due 1997 were initially offered at par, or a price of 100. However, since then, interest rates have risen significantly, and Allied was buffeted by several management changes. As the Federated offering was about to come to market, the Allied bonds traded between 81 3/4 and 82 3/8 to yield 15.45%.    First Boston had been confident that the Federated offering was relatively attractive because the bonds have covenants giving investors greater protection than the Allied offering. Based on Federated's pro forma statement of operations in the year ended Jan. 30, the investment bank calculated that the retailer's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will amount to 1.3 times the company's total annual interest bill. Most junk bond investors consider that ratio acceptable.    Nevertheless, many investors said they weren't enthusiastic about the offering because of their doubts about department stores' prospects in an economy that could be nearing the end of a long expansion. These concerns mounted after Allied reported a drop in sales and a net loss of $107 million in the quarter ended July 30.    In addition, prices of junk bonds generally have fallen in the past two months because of a heavy supply of new offerings and fear of a possible economic slowdown.    First Boston apparently struggled to find buyers for the 12-year Federated bonds, according to traders and investment bankers familiar with the offering. They said mutual funds, which have been the principal buyers of such long-term junk bonds, demanded yields of about 16 1/2%. European, Japanese and some domestic investors apparently were lined up for the eight-year reset notes and the six-year noncall bonds.    Traders said they expect First Boston to restructure the Federated offering, either by raising the yield on the 12-year debentures to about 16.5% or by adding warrants to buy Federated stock.    It's unusual for an underwriter to significantly restructure a major bond offering at the last minute; such changes typically occur several weeks before the scheduled sale date. Last year, in the wake of the stock market crash, underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. and Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. were forced to restructure a junk bond offering of about $1 billion for Southland Corp. The offering was restructured to provide investors with warrants to buy Southland stock.    Even so, investors remained skittish, and Salomon and Goldman acquired for their own accounts about $800 million of the Southland offering, then announced the offering had been sold. The two firms later made multimillion-dollar profits on the bonds when interest rates plummeted in January of this year, and concerns about an imminent recession faded. </TEXT></DOC>
