 Purchasing Commission know that when theydeveloped their Supplynet computer program it would be such a success - inAustralia, that is.andM;Not that the program hasn't benefited the commission, but the Western Stateof Australia has expanded it to include an electronic data interchange (EDI)system that is now being promoted as a potential model for private businessesand governments in Canada.andM;The BCPU (part of the Ministry of Economic Development) developed Supplynetto assist economic development initiatives.andP;  The program provided theprovince with an extensive database on private sector companies and theirproducts.andP;  It has since been modified and incorporated into the companiesdirectory aspect of the new B.C.andP;  Business Network, which uses a form of EDIto provide western businesses with live bid opportunities.andM;While the provincial government is looking seriously at EDI for futureprocurement purposes, it remains to be seen whether or not the &quot;down under&quot;version of Supplynet will be coming back home to B.C.andP;  And, if the folks atBCPU feel they've perhaps missed the boat in terms of Supplynet, they aren'tsaying so.andM;Chief information officer Dave Collison does find it &quot;interesting,&quot; however,that the western state of Australia has been able to adapt the program sowell.andP;  &quot;it's something we're still trying to do internally,&quot; says Collison.andM;Supplynet caught Aussie interest in 1987, when officials from the WesternState paid a visit to the BCPU.andP;  They had been touring several locationslooking for an electronic purchasing program.andP;  Supplynet's concept of adatabase of companies and products seemed the likeliest candidate.andM;&quot;They looked at our concept and thought it was a sound one,&quot; says Collison.andO;&quot;They took the concept (with BCPU's blessing) and expanded on it to add otherelements like live bid opportunities using EDI for communication betweencertain vendors and themselves.&quot;andM;By May, 1989, the state reached an agreement with Telecom Plus (a nationalinformation network) and a private communications company to develop the newversion of Supplynet.andP;  Just three months later, the program was up andrunning.andM;Among other things, it provides on-line database facilities to allowpurchasers and suppliers to access various information and offers anelectronic trading component for quote calling, exchange of purchase ordersand the like.andM;As president of the EDI Council of Canada, Marshall Spence spends much of histime poking and prodding private industry and governments to get on the EDIbandwagon.andM;For Spence, Supplynet's success in Australia is somewhat frustrating becauseit represents a missed opportunity here at home.andM;According to Spence, the BCPU had its doubts about Supplynet's potentialbecause the program was not considered to be &quot;state of the art.andM;&quot;I talked to them and I said I think that's a mistake,&quot; says Spence.andP;  &quot;We getinvolved in this situation where everything has to be state-of-the-arttechnology and all we're doing is adding costs to the data processing processinstead of getting business benefits out of what we've developed.&quot;andM;Western Australia did recognize the potential and proved how little effort ittakes to develop and implement an EDI system.andP;  &quot;They didn't fool around.andO;they got it up and running and out the community.andP;  Now the only way to dobusiness with western Australia is electronically,&quot; says Spence.andP;  &quot;And allthis program does is work.andP;  There are no bells and whistles, nopthingexciting.andP;  It does a hell of a job and they've been able to save lots ofmoney.&quot;andM;He adds that Canadian federal government officials have expressed interest inthe program and that he has encouraged them to go see it in action.andM;According to Spence, Canada is still far behind other countries in terms ofEDI - a situation he says must be rectified and soon.andP;  There is a particularurgency in terms of EDI and B.C., he says, since the province does so muchbusiness with Pacific Rim countries who are moving into EDI at a rapid pace.andM;&quot;Hong Kong, for example, is moving very quickly and is gearing up to be aworld paperless trader.andP;  B.C.andP;  is on the Pacific Rim and they are going tolearn before too long that if they want to do business with the Pacific theyare going to have to use this thing called EDI,&quot; he says, adding that EDI isbecomming &quot;an obsession&quot; in Hong Kong, Taipai and Tokyo.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
