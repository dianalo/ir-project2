In accelerating the subordinated bridge loan, MerrillLynch apparently is trying to put further pressure onCopeland to reach an agreement on restructuring about $387million in debt taken on in Copeland's 1989 purchase ofChurch's Fried Chicken Inc.</LP><TEXT>   Accelerating the debt could increase the likelihood thatCopeland will have to seek bankruptcy-law protection to workout a reorganization plan. Before Merrill Lynch can be paid,Copeland first will have to reach an agreement with itssecured lenders, led by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,which are owed $247 million.   But Copeland said it is negotiating with both MerrillLynch and Canadian Imperial, in an attempt to restructure thedebt. Copeland, which also owns Popeyes Famous Fried Chickenandamp; Biscuits, has been in talks with its lenders sinceSeptember, and hasn't made principal or interest paymentssince then.   Copeland said it has missed $17.8 million in principal,interest and fee payments to its bank group and $7.7 millionin interest owed to Merrill Lynch. It also owes Merrill Lynchapproximately $2 million in notes paid in lieu of cashinterest.   A Merrill Lynch spokesman said the New York-basedinvestment concern accelerated the debt &quot;to protect ourinterests.&quot; Previously, Merrill Lynch sued Copeland forfailing to pay interest, but said it already has written downits loan to an appropriate level.   Copeland purchased Church's in March 1989 after a hotlycontested battle. Merrill Lynch initially hoped to replaceits bridge loan with high-yield, below-investment-grade&quot;junk&quot; bonds, but that market collapsed before the bondscould be sold.</TEXT></DOC>
