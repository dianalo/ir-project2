In three decades of playwriting, he has moved beyond his earlyacclaim as a clever farceur to become the voice of an age and apeople.   In the 1950s, British theater had its Angry Young Men, writingelectrifying portrayals of blue-collar British society.   The 1980s have Ayckbourn, dissecting the underside of theentrepreneurial society championed by Prime Minister MargaretThatcher with his savagely witty depictions of the suburban nouveauxriches and his ear for the way middle-class Britons speak.   His work has been performed in over 35 countries, and he was mostrecently seen in New York with the off-Broadway hit ``Woman inMind'' last year.   He also writes children's plays, mini-musicals and revues. He wasAndrew Lloyd Webber's collaborator on the composer's one flop todate, ``Jeeves,'' and has directed as well, notably Arthur Miller's``A View From the Bridge.''   With the June 13 opening of ``The Revengers' Comedies,'' the50-year-old playwright has arrived _ presenting a two-part, 5{-hourmorality tale that is winning rave reviews.   It's his 37th play, the same number William Shakespeare wrote.But it is quality, not quantity, for which Britain's busiestdramatist hopes to be remembered.   ``I hope my plays hold up in 400 years. That's the real test,''he said in an interview.   The Independent in London found it ``killingly funny ...masterly.'' The New York Times said ``Ayckbourn has outdonehimself'' and paid tribute to ``the most extraordinary career incontemporary English playwriting.''   The play, which won't reach London's West End until 1991, waslaunched at the Stephen Joseph Theater in the Round in the northYorkshire seaside town of Scarborough, where it will run throughSept. 23.   Scarborough is entirely in character with a man whose plays arerooted in a sense of place and who himself has little time for thepretensions of London's social circuit.   Ayckbourn became the theater's artistic director in 1971. ``I'm achronicler of small communities,'' he said. ``One sees events andpeople and the rise and fall of individuals in a town such as this.''   ``The Revengers' Comedies'' begins with a chance encounter by twopeople intent on suicide and examines the consequences of a revengepact that leaves careers, houses, and people in ruins. As the plotthickens, the tone darkens, subverting any notion of Ayckbourn as aBritish Neil Simon.   A similar mix of comedy and tragedy characterizes ``Henceforward...,'' his current West End hit, about a composer writing a symphonyof love as the world around him slides into hatred, and ``A SmallFamily Business,'' which takes comic aim at the English bourgeoisie.   Both plays have U.S. productions on tap. ``Henceforward ...,''which had a 1987 run at Houston's Alley Theater, will be staged inLos Angeles next spring. ``A Small Family Business'' is headed forNew York in 1990.   These works have led to a reassessment by critics who have tendedto see Ayckbourn as little more than a laugh machine.   The reappraisal became noticeable after ``Woman in Mind,'' hisrending study of a housewife driven mad by her banal suburbansurroundings.   But the hand of a social anatomist can be seen as far back as1972 in ``Absurd Person Singular,'' in which the vanities and classwars of three couples are traced over three Christmases.   ``The Norman Conquests'' in 1973 showed his technical virtuosity,presenting the same story in three intricately linked plays, eachtime from the viewpoint of a different participant at a familygathering. His 1982 ``Intimate Exchanges'' had several differentendings depending on the toss of a coin.   Ayckbourn is celebrated for his craftsmanship _ ``I am interestedin technique; I just don't want it to show too much'' _ but sayscontent is paramount.   ``I think I'm a moral dramatist,'' he said. ``Absurd PersonSingular'' was ``the first time I noticed it in myself ... the storyof the triumph of Mammon, a theme that's cropped up a lot since.''   Although his characters never mention Mrs. Thatcher by name, theyare almost without exception steeped in her capitalist ethos.   ``I'm alarmed and worried by some of the attitudes that have comeout of that philosophy, but I think it's wider than her; she bearsthe title,'' he said.   Less preachy than leftist colleagues David Hare, Howard Brentonand Doug Lucie, Ayckbourn calls himself ``a woolly liberal in themiddle.''   ``It's a little like doing anti-Tory plays at miners' galas:There's no point,'' he said. ``I should be doing plays forConservative clubs, but in order to do so, you've got to get inthere with a slow-burning fuse.''   ``I hope in the end one says the right thing, if you like: thatmoney and power are dangerous not inherently of themselves but inthe using of them.''   This autumn will see the movie version of his 1984 play ``AChorus of Disapproval,'' directed by Michael Winner and starringJeremy Irons and Anthony Hopkins. It's Ayckbourn's debut as ascreenwriter, but he remains committed to the stage.   ``In the end, film doesn't seem to add much to my work. Itreplaces my narrative with a narrative of its own,'' he said.``Things inevitably disappear.''   ``The theater is where I get my buzz from. I just get excitedwith all the bricks and mortar of it.''</TEXT></DOC>
