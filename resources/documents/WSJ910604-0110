That can be a good deal for employees. Because thepolicies are negotiated by the employer and the insurancecarrier, they frequently include the best features ofindividual policies.</LP><TEXT>   Some even offer coverage to retirees and to employees'parents and parents-in-law. Premiums are often lower than foran individual policy.   &quot;There are definitely advantages to group buying,&quot; saysBryan Lane, a principal in Towers, Perrin, Forster andamp; CrosbyInc., a benefits consulting firm.   But as good as the coverage can be, employees should thinkcarefully before signing up, financial professionals say.   Unlike many corporate benefits, long-term care insurancetypically is paid for by the employee, and premiums can addup to thousands of dollars over the years. Moreover, it couldbe 30 or 40 years before benefits are received, if ever, andnot all plans are alike.   &quot;It's something worth investigating, but not a must-do formost people,&quot; says S. Timothy Kochis, national director ofpersonal financial planning for accountants Deloitte andamp;Touche.   Insurance against the day you might have to go into anursing home isn't the sort of thing most people like tothink about. But some sort of planning is clearly necessary.   &quot;At some point in their lives, many people are going toneed one to three years of care,&quot; says George Barbee,executive director of personal financial services foraccountants Price Waterhouse. He says that $20,000 to$100,000 in costs &quot;could creep up and bite you.&quot;   Studies indicate that 43% of all Americans who turn 65this year will eventually enter a nursing home, and many morewill require paid help to continue living at home. Thenumbers are bound to increase as the population bulge knownas the baby boom ages. One-fifth of all Americans will beover 65 in 2030.   Hardest hit by the enormous cost of care will be middleand upper middle income families who have accumulated assetsthat they'd like to pass on to their heirs. The wealthyprobably can absorb the expense and still have somethingleft, and the poor are covered by Medicaid. Medicare, thefederally funded health care program for the elderly, andother health insurance rarely pay for the nursing care andother support services.   Nursing-home insurance has been around for about a decade,although the earliest policies often set conditions that madethem virtually useless. Many didn't cover such conditions asAlzheimer's disease, required a hospital stay before nursinghome benefits would be paid, and didn't account forinflation. Care at home usually wasn't included.   There have been some improvements in recent years. ButConsumers Union, which recently evaluated 94 policies open toindividuals, warns in the June issue of its Consumer Reportsmagazine that it is still very important to shop carefullywhen considering long-term care insurance. The magazine saysmany agents confuse or mislead consumers, often because oftheir own ignorance.   Long-term care insurance has been offered as part ofemployee-benefits packages for only about three years. Some150 employers were offering long-term care insurance in 1990,covering about 125,000 individuals, according to the HealthInsurance Association of America, a trade group.   Companies with plans now in place include such corporategiants as International Business Machines Corp., Procter andamp;Gamble Co. and American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., whichoften become trendsetters in the benefits area as smalleremployers try to remain competitive. At least 100 more firmshave plans in the works, employee-benefits consultants say.   &quot;It's a productivity issue,&quot; says Ann Lemmon of benefitsconsultants Hewitt Associates. &quot;Employees who are caregiversfor parents, in-laws, are coming in late, leaving early,spending time on the phone. Employers are looking for ways tohelp them cope.&quot;   Typically, long-term care insurance is offered as part ofa flexible benefits package. Since the employee usually paysthe entire premium, costs to the company are minimal at atime when many employers are trying to cut medical benefitsto hold down costs.   Some policies cover just nursing homes, others cover homecare as well, and some plans permit employees to choose.Daily benefits may range from $25 a day for care at home to$150 at a nursing home. IBM, for instance, permits employeesto choose among three levels of coverage -- $50 a day, $100 aday and $150 a day, with benefits for home care payable up to50% of the benefit chosen.   Some policies cover hospice care, either at home or in afacility for the terminally ill, and some cover adult daycare or temporary care to give family members who arecaregivers some time off.   Generally, the plans set a dollar value for the maximumlifetime benefit, although there are policies that set themaximum in terms of days of coverage. The waiting period forbenefits to begin may range from 30 to 120 days. A typicalstandard for qualifying for benefits is that someone beunable to perform two or three &quot;activities of daily living,&quot;such as eating, bathing or dressing without assistance.   Sometimes employees are covered regardless of theirmedical history, although there may be a waiting periodbefore benefits are paid for a pre-existing condition.Spouses usually can be covered, too.   Premiums vary with the age of the insured and the extentof coverage. At ATandamp;T, for instance, a 25-year-old employeeopting for a nursing home-only policy with a maximum dailybenefit of $60 would pay 95 cents a month. A 50-year-old IBMemployee opting for $100 maximum daily benefit would payabout $30 a month.   People as young as 25 usually can't get individualcoverage to take advantage of low premiums. A 50-year-oldindividual would probably pay more than $400 a year for apolicy with similar benefits to the IBM plan, insurancecompany officials say, although direct comparisons aredifficult. What's more, IBM will reimburse employees up to20% of their annual premium.   Corporate policies generally stipulate the premiums won'tchange once an employee is enrolled, except if they changeacross the board because of claims experience. That's a bigif -- carriers have had very little claims experience so farto base premiums on.   Corporate-sponsored plans generally call for arenegotiation of premiums after three years or so to accountfor inflation. Employees are usually guaranteed theopportunity to increase their maximum benefit to offsetinflation, with the new premium based on their age when theyinitially enrolled. As a result, someone who had been payingin money for, say, 20 years would have a smaller premium thansomeone the same age who was just enrolling in the plan.   Most plans permit employees to continue coverage at grouprates if they leave the company. Some provide for reducedbenefits if the employee drops out of the plan after a numberof years or a payment to the estate of someone who diesbefore receiving benefits.   ---   Ron Winslow contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
