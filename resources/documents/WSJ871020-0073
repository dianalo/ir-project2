Slowly and painfully, Florida's cities and counties are beginning to sort through the requirements of the nation's most comprehensive state planning law.    The two-year-old act is designed to control the explosive urban and suburban growth that's accompanying the state's meteoric rise in population and to protect what remains of the fragile coastal environment. As written, the planning law will have more long-run impact by far on Florida residents than two recent decisions by the legislature that won the state national notoriety: a tax on advertisers, lawyers, and most of the rest of the service sector, and a go-ahead for citizens with permits to carry side arms.    The Growth Management Act of 1985, to use its formal name, is supposed to guarantee that population doesn't grow faster than the physical means to support it. The idea is that schools, roads, sewers, parks, libraries and assorted other infrastructure should be in place, or at least under contract, before developers throw up new houses and condominiums.    IN THE NEXT THREE years, every one of Florida's local governments -- 459 counties, cities and towns -- must draft a master plan, or update an existing one, describing how each intends to cope with future growth. Master plans are notorious for gathering fees for planners and dust on city hall shelves, but Florida's plans are serious business.    For starters, each document must lay out a &quot;level of service&quot; for transportation, health care, education and so on, that fits with the existing population. Once accepted by the state, the community can't issue building permits, or approve zoning changes, that would cause a deficit in those service levels.    Since the plans have the force of law, communities must follow the blueprint or risk penalties, such as loss of state aid on infrastructure projects.    &quot;If you don't plan, then taxpayers aren't obliged to support growth in your community. That's the concept underlying the whole bill,&quot; says Jim Quinn, chief of the bureau of local planning in the state Department of Community Affairs, the agency that's riding herd on the local plans.    The comprehensive plan for Brevard County, a narrow north-south swath of Atlantic beachfront that includes the Cape Canaveral space complex, is due in Tallahassee next April.    Like most Florida counties, Brevard's population has already outstripped the capacity of some local services. Transportation is a big worry. The county needs to build an environmentally sound two-mile bridge to an offshore barrier island for hurricane evacuation. Space agency workers tie up the highways, and the county hopes the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will kick in some road money in lieu of the taxes it escapes as a federal agency.    DRAFTING A REALISTIC, legally binding plan when key services are already inadequate is agonizing. &quot;You start running the numbers up, and you find you don't have enough money to cover the deficiencies,&quot; says Gary Ridenour, Brevard's planning and development director. &quot;You're talking 40 to 50 years of bad decision-making. You can't correct that in two or three years.&quot;    To make population mesh with services, Monroe County, which takes in the Florida Keys, is trying to limit future population density by ruling that up to 16,000 vacant lots are now unbuildable. In some cases, &quot;if you own two lots side by side, you're now only allowed to build one house. That has really set people off,&quot; says Charles Pattison, director of the Monroe County Land Authority.    The uncertain status of the controversial state tax on services is a further complication. The tax was supposed to raise billions of dollars to build highways, waste treatment plants, and other infrastructure projects critical to Florida's long-term economic health. If the tax is repealed or sharply scaled down, which seems likely, the level of services called for in the planning act will be even harder to achieve.    Looking on the bright side, Brevard County's Mr. Ridenour notes that &quot;the marketplace is very hungry for planners down here.&quot;    ---   THEY'D RATHER BE IN IOWA: Western state legislators invited 11 Republican and Democratic presidential contenders to their annual meeting last month in Hawaii. Not one showed up. The snubbed legislators are now warning prospective candidates about ignoring the West. In the crowded and uncertain 1988 presidential field, Western state primaries that fall late in the nominating season &quot;may well prove decisive,&quot; the legislators said in pointed letters mailed to each politician.    ---   YOU CAN TRUST CITY HALL, at least when compared with the White House. Asked which branch of government merits the most confidence, 37% of those polled by the Gallup Organization put their faith in local government, as opposed to 19% for the federal government. The balance favored state government or had no opinion. The question is from an annual survey of public attitudes toward government and taxes commissioned by the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations. </TEXT></DOC>
