Jefferies, a central figure in the government'scrackdown on securities-law crime in the 1980s, sold back tothe company for $11 million his entire 14.8% stake inJefferies Group Inc., the company said.   The sale of Mr. Jefferies' 800,000-share block endedspeculation that the firm's 60-year-old founder eventuallymight pick up the reins there again. After pleading guilty totwo felony counts of securities fraud in 1987 he was forcedto resign as Jefferies Group chairman and was barred from thesecurities business for five years.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Jefferies said yesterday that he didn't thinkmanagement of the Los Angeles-based securities concern wouldwelcome him back after his probation ends in July.   &quot;I really felt that six months from now it was probablygoing to be impossible for me to go back with the company,&quot;Mr. Jefferies was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.He also indicated that he hoped to return to the securitiesbusiness next year. Mr. Jefferies didn't return telephonemessages left at his home in Palm Springs, Calif.   Frank E. Baxter, chairman and chief executive officer ofJefferies, said the government settlement precluded anydiscussion of the matter between the two men.   Jefferies, which specializes in trading listed securitiesaway from the exchanges, was particularly popular withcorporate raiders and speculators during the 1980s. The firmand its powerful founder often were entrusted with sensitiveinstructions to buy or sell large blocks of stocks inconnection with pending or rumored takeovers.   Mr. Jefferies pleaded guilty to one count of engaging in astock &quot;parking&quot; arrangement with speculator Ivan Boesky toconceal Mr. Boesky's ownership of a large block of stock. Theother count involved manipulation with takeover speculatorSalim &quot;Sandy&quot; Lewis of a public offering of Fireman's FundCorp. shares. Mr. Jefferies wasn't charged with insidertrading.   After his guilty plea, Mr. Jefferies helped the governmentin its investigation of other securities-law violations.Reflecting that cooperation, he received a suspended sentenceand was fined $250,000. The lenient sentence and fine wereconsidered a slap on the wrist for Mr. Jefferies, whoseassets were estimated at the time at $30 million.   Mr. Jefferies' testimony helped the government to convictPaul Bilzerian, former Singer Co. chairman and corporateraider. Mr. Jefferies also provided information against Mr.Lewis, who later pleaded guilty to three felony counts inconnection with the Fireman's Fund scheme. In March, afederal appeals court overturned convictions onstock-manipulation charges against GAF Corp. and a former GAFexecutive against whom Mr. Jefferies testified.   In recent years, Mr. Jefferies has spent much of his timeworking with a children's golf clinic in Aspen, Colo.</TEXT></DOC>
