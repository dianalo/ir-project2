The Houston-based home-building concern said its 17 banklenders were unable to agree unanimously on renewing thecompany's credit line in a way that fits the needs of thecompany and the requirements of bondholders.</LP><TEXT>   The company also said the bank group was unwilling toprovide interim financing for home-building operations thisyear, reflecting the continuing tightness of creditthroughout the industry. The company said it will seekbankruptcy-court approval for $65 million in financing from alender it declined to identify.   U.S. Home President Isaac Heimbinder said the company'sinability to obtain even short-term financing was imperilingits operations, particularly as home sales improve in someparts of the country.   &quot;Business is good,&quot; Mr. Heimbinder said, &quot;and we need themoney.&quot;   The company will be ranked as the nation's eighth-largesthome builder, based on number of housing units started in1990, in Builder magazine's annual survey of builders. Thecompany started 4,869 homes in 1990, compared with 4,793 in1989, when the company was ranked as the ninth-largest homebuilder.   U.S. Home peaked with the Texas oil boom in the early1980s, building about 14,000 homes and recording more than $1billion in revenue in fiscal 1983. It was hammered by thedecline in the Texas economy, yet managed to restructure in1986 and expand into new markets in Florida, California andother states.   As the company expanded into new markets, it also beganshedding unprofitable units such as its manufactured housingsubsidiary, and reducing its bank debt by almost half.Analyst Barbara K. Allen of Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. said U.S.Home's management deserves praise for streamlining thecompany over the past five years.   However, the national housing slump and a shortage ofcredit prompted it to take an $82.2 million charge in the1990 fourth quarter to reflect a write-down of investments injoint ventures and land and housing inventories. For theyear, it had a net loss of $101.6 million, or $2.27 a share,on revenue of $590.5 million.   The company listed assets of $619.6 million andliabilities of $535.4 million in its bankruptcy filing. Itslist of largest unsecured lenders is dominated by the membersof its bank group, including the banking units of Citicorpand Chemical Banking Corp.   Mr. Heimbinder said the company sought bankruptcy-courtprotection in New York because the majority of its creditorsand its lawyers are based there. The case was assigned toU.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton R. Lifland.</TEXT></DOC>
