We find a rapid decrease of thepseudoparticle density at T {approx_equal} (1-2){Lambda}anti Manti Sfor SU/sub 2/ and, especially, for SU/sub 3/ gauge groups. This phenomenonmay serve as a mechanism for the restoration of chiral symmetry at hightemperatures (T {approx_equal} {Lambda}anti Manti S).</TEXT></DOC>
