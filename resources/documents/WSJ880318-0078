Campbell said the change, adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board statement No. 96, will be applied retroactively to earnings from the start of the year.    The company added that the effect of the change, which involves the calculation of deferred taxes, will be largely offset by previously announced special expenses, such as an early retirement program.    Campbell's stock closed at $30.125, up $1.125, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
