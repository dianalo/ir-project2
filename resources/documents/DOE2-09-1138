The result of this analysis showsthat radiation crosslinking offers the greatest potential in the developmentof new and better materials for numerous applications on account of itsapplicability to a wide range of polymers. A further advantage of radiationcrosslinking is the freedom to choose the degree of crosslinking appropriateto the required performance of a given product. Unique possibilitiesare provided by radiation crosslinking in special applications. Amongthem, the manufacture of products with locally different material propertiesby varying the degree of crosslinking is particularly mentioned. As forthe economic aspects of radiation processing, it is emphasized that itsgreat potential lies in the substitution of more expensive materialsby crosslinked low-cost polymers. As the economic feasibility of radiationprocessing is limited to facilities with large installed irradiationcapacities, contract irradiation centers treating the products of numerouscustomers assume the role of pacemakers for the utilization of the manifoldtechnical advantages of radiation crosslinking.
