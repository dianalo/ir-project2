On other markets, stock-index futures fell sharply; grain andsoybean prices retreated broadly; and livestock and meat futureswere mixed.   The sharp increase in energy futures prices on a rumoredproduction cut by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countrieshad inflationary implications that supported precious metalsfutures, analysts said.   ``There's a view in the market that inflation's going to bepicking up toward the end of the year and that inflation is goingto be more of a concern than recession at year end,'' said FredDemler, metals economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in NewYork.   In addition, talk of physical tightness developing in the cashplatinum market after two quarters of price weakness helped spurbuying of platinum futures, and some of that buying interestspilled over into the gold market, Demler said.   Demler said the gold and platinum markets were oversold and duefor an upside correction to bring futures prices more in line withreality.   Silver futures declined slightly.   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $7 to $8.40higher with the contract for delivery in April at $444.50 a troyounce; silver was 3.3 cents to 3.7 cents lower with March at $6.265a troy ounce.   Platinum settled $16.80 to $18.50 higher on the New YorkMercantile Exchange with April at $498.10.   The rumors of OPEC production cuts that fueled the jump inenergy futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange were laterdenied, but oil prices fell only slightly from their highs of theday.   Market players still expect OPEC nations to take measures aimedat boosting prices, said Bob Baker, an analyst for Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc. in New York.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 44 cents to 51 centshigher with April at $16 a barrel; heating oil was .72 cent to 1.07cents higher with April at 43.93 cents a gallon; unleaded gasolinewas .66 cent to 1.14 cents higher at 45.14 cents a gallon.   Inflationary fears also contributed to a sharp drop instock-index futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, analystssaid.   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange's contract for March delivery ofthe Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index settled 6.75 points lower at262.90, nearly a full point below the spot index.   Grain and soybean futures closed broadly lower on the ChicagoBoard of Trade with little buying interest in the face of bearishfundamentals.   Traders expect a March 31 government report on spring plantingswill show a general increase in crop acreage, said Ted Mao, grainspecialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   Other market pressures include the large soybean crop now beingharvested in South America, an increase in world vegetable-oilproduction and the lackluster prospects for new grain export salesto the Soviet Union in the near term, Mao said.   Wheat settled 4} cents to 9 cents lower with March at $2.90 abushel; corn was 1 cent to 2\ cents lower with March at $1.97} abushel; oats were 3 cents to 6 cents lower with March at $1.81\ abushel; soybeans were 2\ cents to 6 cents lower with March at$6.03} a bushel.   Live cattle futures finished slightly lower on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange on expectations of increased slaughters nextweek, analysts said. Feeder cattle were mostly higher.   Pork futures retreated on ideas that ham supplies weresufficient to satisfy Eastertime demand, said Tom O'Hare, analystin New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.   Live cattle were .08 cent lower to .02 cent higher with April at72.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .48 centhigher with March at 81.55 cents a pound; hogs were .28 cent lowerto .05 cent higher with April at 43.32 cents a pound; frozen porkbellies were .50 cent to .75 cent lower with March at 51.65 cents apound.</TEXT></DOC>
