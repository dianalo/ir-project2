<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-36-1107 </DOCNO><TEXT>A novel monolithic coupling scheme in which three or four active waveguidesinteract interferometrically to form a multicavity semiconductor laseris demonstrated. The coupling between perpendicular waveguides is obtainedby an integrated beamsplitter. Frequency selection, tunability, and singlemode operation are demonstrated.</TEXT></DOC>
