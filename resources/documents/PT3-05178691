C. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  This invention relates to a process for producing a rare earth      element-iron-boron magnet that may generate a strong static magnetic field      in vacant spaces of a magnetic circuit mounted in a motor, which is used      for example in audio visual systems, office automation systems, etc. More      particularly, it relates to a process for producing a rare earth      element-iron-boron magnet comprising applying pressure to a billet of a      rapid solidification powder of a rare earth element-iron-boron alloy while      allowing a current to pass through the billet to conduct a plastic      deformation. Said rapid solidification powder is a mixture of crystalline      structures and amorphous structures. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  Said motor requires a magnet with high residual induction and thermal      stability. For that reason, an Sm-Co type sintered magnet has been used in      the past. However, in recent years a rare earth element-iron-boron      sintered magnet with high residual induction which is produced according      to a powder metallurgy method has been utilized as described in Japanese      Patent Publication No. Laid Open 61-111514, which may urge the development      of a compact motor with high output powder. </PAR><PAR>  On the other hand, it is well known that a magnetic material is subjected      to a plastic deformation for providing its texture with magnetic      anisotropy, thereby obtaining excellent magnetic properties in a certain      direction. For example, a texture of grain oriented silicon steel plate      which is formed by a roll magnetic anisotropy method is well know. Also,      there are other magnets known in the art, for example, a Mn-Al-C, and rare      earth element-iron-boron rapid solidification magnets which are made by      plastic deformation techniques of magnetic materials such as an extruding      procedure, die-upsetting procedure, and the like. These magnetic      anisotropy techniques are based on a principle that when the magnetic      material is subjected to plastic deformation, there is a certain      relationship between the direction of stress or strain and the axis of      easy magnetization of the crystals of the materials. </PAR><PAR>  A rare earth element-iron-boron rapid solidification magnet is produced by      (1) melting a raw material mixture of Nd, Fe, B, and other added elements      as needed, (2) rapid solidification the melted mixture by a melt-spinning      procedure to form a rapid solidification flake powder of fine crystal      having an R.sub.2 TM.sub.14 B phase, wherein R is neodymium(Nd) and/or      praseodymium(Pr), TM is iron(Fe) and/or cobalt(Co), and B is boron, as a      major phase with a grain size of about 20-500 nm, (3) applying pressure to      the rapid solidification powder to form a billet at high temperatures, and      then (4) subjecting the billet to plastic deformation (Japanese Laid-Open      Patent Publication 60-100402). For example, the raw material mixture is      melted by an arc discharge, and then rapidly solidified by a single roll      method under Ar atmosphere to form a rapid solidification flake powder      with a thickness generally of 20-30 .mu.m which is a mixture of      crystalline structures and amorphous structures. The rapid solidification      powder is roughly ground to 32 mesh or less. Then, a pressure of about 3      tonf/cm.sup.2 is applied to the ground rapid solidification powder in a      hard metal mold. The pressed rapid solidification powder is then subjected      to high-frequency heating at a temperature of 600.degree. to 800.degree.      C. while applying a pressure of 0.5-2 tonf/cm.sup.2 to form a billet      having full density. Then, the billet is placed in a mold cavity of the      hard metal mold of which the surface is treated with a graphite lining,      and then subjected to plastic deformation under a pressure of 0.5-2.5      tonf/cm.sup.2 during a high-frequency heating to form a rare earth      element-iron-boron. </PAR><PAR>  Although these conventional plastic deformation techniques disclose the      production of magnets with magnetic anisotropy, they do not disclose any      particular method for forming a specific shape, or maintaining magnetic      properties. </PAR><PAR>  According to this plastic deformation technique, the billet of the rapid      solidification powder is held for a long period of time such as several      hundred seconds at temperatures higher than its crystallization      temperature, or heated to an elevated temperature of 750.degree. C. or      more, the fine crystals of the rapid solidification powder become larger,      which may cause the reduction of intrinsic coercivity. </PAR><PAR>  The thermal stability of magnetic properties such as intrinsic coercivity      of magnet depends generally on the value of the intrinsic coercivity, and      its temperature coefficent. When the intrinsic coercivity of magnet is      larger, or its temperature coefficient is smaller, the thermal stability      of the magnet will be improved. For example, the intrinsic coercivity of a      sintered magnet has been increased to 20 kOe by the addition of      dysprosium(Dy) or other elements in order to maintain its thermal      stability. However, when the intrinsic coercivity of the magnet is      increased, the residual induction for an applied magnetic field is      reduced, which makes it difficult to generate a strong static magnetic      field in vacant spaces of a magnetic circuit. Therefore, it is desirable      that the thermal stability of a magnet be improved by reducing the      temperature coefficient of intrinsic coercivity of the magnet. For      instance, a rare earth element-iron-boron sintered magnet or rapid      solidification magnet with a maximum energy product of 30 MGOe or more has      the temperature coefficient of intrinsic coercivity of -0.6%/.degree.C.      The above value of about -0.6%/.degree.C. is not sufficiently low as a      temperature coefficient of the intrinsic coercivity, therefore, because of      a great demagnetization by heat, the stability against the heat from a      magnetic circuit cannot be sufficiently secured. For that reason, reducing      the temperature coefficient to -0.5%/.degree.C. or less is preferable.      However, it is difficult to reduce the temperature coefficient of      intrinsic coercivity of the rapid solidification magnet to      -0.5%/.degree.C. or less by conventional plastic deformation techniques. </PAR><PAR>  Also, when a sintered magnet is produced by these plastic deformation      techniques, its magnetic properties may be damaged in the plastic      deformation process for providing it with magnetic anisotropy. In the case      of the sintered magnet, an alloy powder ground to the size of particle      which can become a single magnetic domain is formed in the magnetic field      before sintering. When a small and thin magnet is formed in the magnetic      field, however, the orientation of the particle in the magnetic field      tends to be disturbed due to the compressed pressure because the direction      of the magnetic field is identical to that of the compression. For      example, it is difficult for a thin magnet or about 1 mm thickness to      obtain a residual induction of 11 kg or more because of the disturbed      orientation of the particle. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The process for producing a rare earth element-iron-boron anisotropic      magnet of this invention, which overcomes the above-discussed and numerous      other disadvantages and deficiencies of the prior art, comprises the steps      of: placing a billet produced of rapid solidification powder of a rare      earth element-iron-boron alloy into a mold cavity, applying a primary      pressure to said billet, while allowing a primary current to pass through      said billet, applying to said billet a secondary pressure which is      increased up to at least five times as much as the primary pressure, and      applying a secondary current greater than the primary current through said      billet, wherein the billet is finally subjected to plastic deformation at      the temperature between the crystalline temperature and 750.degree. C. </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred embodiment, the mold cavity is formed between a pair of      electrodes which are located inside an electrically non-conductive die,      wherein the electrodes have a ratio of specific electric resistance to      volume specific heat in the range of 10.sup.-4 to 10.sup.-2 in which the      volume specific heat is defined by a product of specific gravity and      specific heat. </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred embodiment, a film of a mixture including boron nitride(BN)      and an organic polymer is formed on the top surface of the electrodes to      be contacted with the billet, and at least one part of the film is      subjected to dielectric breakdown by discharging the film and applying a      primary current. </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred embodiment, the electrode is comprised of electrically      conductive ceramics at the side of the billet, and graphite at the other      side. </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred embodiment, the billet side of the electrode, and the      non-conductive die are made from a material containing SIALON (Si.sub.6-z      Al.sub.z O.sub.z N.sub.6-z ; z is 1-4.60). </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred embodiment, the rapid solidification powder is a flake      powder having an R.sub.2 TM.sub.14 B phase, wherein R is at least either      neodymium(Nd) or praseodymium(Pr), TM is at least either iron(Fe) or      cobalt(Co), and B is boron, as a major phase with the mean grain size of      500 nm or less, and said rare earth element-iron alloy contains 13 to 15      atomic percent of at least either neodymium(Nd) or praseodymium(Pr), 5 to      7 atomic percent of boron(B), and the balance of at least either iron(Fe)      or cobalt(Co). </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred embodiment, the billet is formed by mixing an R-TM-B alloy,      wherein R is at least either neodymium(Nd) or praseodymium(Pr), TM is at      least either iron(Fe) or cobalt(Co), B is boron, with an R-TM-B-Ga alloy,      wherein R is at least either neodymium(Nd) or praseodymium(Pr), TM is at      least either iron(Fe) or cobalt(Co), B is boron, and Ga is gallium, and      then solidifying the mixture. </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred embodiment, the billet is formed by solidifying the flake      rapid solidification powder with a diameter of 53 .mu.m or more. </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred embodiment, the billet has a relative density of 95% or      less. </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred embodiment, the ratio of the sectional area S of said cavity      to the sectional area S.sub.o of the billet is 2 to 3 in which both      sectional areas are located at the right angle of the pressure. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, the invention described herein makes possible the objectives: (1)      providing a plastic deformation technique of a rapid solidification powder      of a rare earth element-iron-boron alloy by which a rare earth      element-iron-boron magnet with magnetic anisotropy and excellent      dimensional precision is produced at the temperature between 750.degree.

The electrodes 2 and 2'      are comprised of the electrode parts 2a and 2a' at the side of the billet,      and the electrode parts 2b and 23b' at the other side. Also, a film for a      mixture including boron nitride(BN) and an organic polymer is formed on      the top surface of the electrode parts 2a and 2a'. In FIG. 1, a 30 V pulse      voltage source (I), and a 6 V direct constant-current source (II) are      connected electrically to the electrodes 2b and 2b' by a transfer switch      through a pressure axis rod. There is provided a chamber outside the die      3, and electrodes 2 and 2' to evacuate the system around the billet, if      any. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a graph showing the relationship between the distance of the      electrodes .DELTA.h moved from the original place in the direction of the      pressure when the billet is subjected to plastic deformation, the      differential curve of the distance .DELTA.h/.DELTA.t, and the temperature      of the mold parts. The curve T1 corresponds to the temperature of the      billet 1 measured by a thermocouple after removing the die 3. The symbols      A, B, C, D and E refer to the stages of the plastic deformation technique. </PAR><PAR>  The following illustrates the plastic deformation technique of a billet,      referring to FIGS. 1(a), 1(b), 1(c) and 1(d), and FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  First, uniaxial pressure is applied to the billet 1 through the electrodes      2 and 2'. The film of a mixture including boron nitride(BN) and an organic      polymer is subjected to dielectric breakdown by pulse discharge from the      operation of a 30 V pulse voltage source (I) between the electrodes 2 and      2' to ensure the electric conductivity between them while maintaining the      pressure. </PAR><PAR>  The step between the stages A and B in FIG. 2 corresponds to the step of      FIG. 1(a), which comprises ensuring the electric conductivity between the      electrodes 2 and 2', and then heating the electrodes 2 and 2', billet 1,      and die 3 with Joule's heat generated from the primary current I.sub.1      while applying the primary pressure P.sub.1 to the billet. It can be seen      from FIG. 2 that the temperature of the billet 1 is increased more rapidly      than that of the die 3. In stage B of FIG. 2, the temperature of the      billet reaches around its crystallization temperature (about 580.degree.      C.) at which the plastic deformation of the billet commences with the      decrease of its viscosity. </PAR><PAR>  The step between the stages B and C in FIG. 2 corresponds to the step of      FIG. 1(b), in which the temperature increase of the billet 1 slows down      due to the heat leakage, and then the temperature of the billet 1 is      increased again when the plastically deformed billet comes into contact      with the surface of the mold cavity of the die 3. </PAR><PAR>  The step between the stages C and D in FIG. 2 corresponds to the step of      FIG. 1(c), in which the plastic deformation of the billet 1 is accelerated      by the secondary pressure P.sub.2 of over about 200 kgf/cm.sup.2 which is      greater than the primary pressure P.sub.1. </PAR><PAR>  The step between the stages D and E in FIG. 2 corresponds to the step of      FIG. 1(d), in which the billet 1 is formed in a specific shape by allowing      the secondary current I.sub.2 (andgt;I.sub.1) to pass through the billet 1. </PAR><PAR>  As described above, the plastic deformation of the billet 1 is completed in      a short period of time such as ten to one hundred seconds by the addition      of Joule's heat generated from the current. </PAR><PAR>  Next, the following illustrates the electrodes 2 and 2', and the      electrically non-conductive die 3, both of which form the mold cavity. </PAR><PAR>  A pair of electrodes should have a ratio of specific electric      resistant(.rho./.OMEGA.cm) to volume specific heat(cal/.degree.C. g) in      the range of 10.sup.-4 to 10.sup.-2 wherein the volume specific heat is      defined by a product of specific gravity and specific heat. Preferably,      the electrodes are comprised of electric conductive ceramics at the side      of the billet, and graphite at the other side. The materials that can be      used for the electric conductive ceramics include for example sintered      composite ceramics of SIALON(Si.sub.6-z Al.sub.z O.sub.z N.sub.6-z ; z is      1-4.60), and carbides or nitrides of Group VI elements such as      titanium(Ti), zirconium(Zr), hafnium(Hf), etc. However, the sintered      composite ceramics of SIALON, and TiC, carbides or nitrides of Zr or Hf      have less oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures, and therefore      those containing SIALON and TiN are preferably used. The amount of      addition of TiN is from 30 volume % in which each TiN phase starts      contacting together in the sintered composite ceramics, to 70 volume % in      which each TiN phase starts contacting together in the sintered composite      ceramics, to 70 volume % in which the strength at elevated temperatures of      the sintered composite ceramics starts decreasing, significantly. The      sintered composite ceramics are suitable for use as an electrode material      because they can be worked by an electric discharging machine to form an      electrode of different shapes with high dimensional precision. </PAR><PAR>  On the other hand, the electrodes at the other side of the billet are      comprised of graphite so as to accelerate the temperature increase of the      billet due to Joule's heat generated from the current passing through the      electrodes in an initial stage of the plastic deformation. The temperature      increase of the electrodes in the initial stage is effective for      increasing rapidly the temperature of the billet to the crystallization      temperature or more. Also, when the temperature of the billet reaches the      crystallization temperature, both the reduction of calorific value and the      heat leakage may slow down the temperature increase of the billet, so that      it is easy to subject the billet to plastic deformation in such a specific      range as between the crystallization temperature and 750.degree. C. In      other words, the specific electric resistance of graphite is reduced      exponentially as the temperature increases from room temperature to      700.degree. C. while its volume specific heat at 700.degree. C. is      approximately twice as much as the volume specific heat at room      temperature, so that the calorific value generated from the primary      current at the crystallization temperature is controlled to about 30-40%      of that in room temperature. Therefore, after the temperature of the      billet is increased rapidly to the crystallization temperature, it can be      maintained between the crystallization temperature and 750.degree. C. for      about ten to one hundred seconds. Moreover, the specific electric      resistance of ends. Moreover, the specific electric resistance of the      electrically conductive materials such as TiN contained in the      electrically conductive ceramics which comprise the electrodes at the side      of the billet is increased linearly, so its calorific value is about twice      as much as in room temperature. Thus, by allowing the secondary current to      pass through the billet, it is advantageously subjected to plastic      deformation so as to form a specific shape. </PAR><PAR>  Additionally, the formation of a film of a mixture including boron      nitride(BN) and an organic polymer on the top surface of the electrodes is      effective for not only the reductions of the friction between the billet      and the electrodes during the plastic deformation, but the smooth release      of the resulting magnet from the mold cavity. The electrically      non-conductive die is preferably made from SIALON itself not only because      SIALON is inactive against most of rare earth elements such as Nd, Pr and      the like, but because is has lower friction coefficient, excellent thermal      strength at elevated temperatures, and durability for a mold. </PAR><PAR>  The following illustrates a rapid solidification powder of rare earth      element-iron-boron. </PAR><PAR>  The rapid solidification powder of rare earth element-iron-boron alloy is a      flake powder of fine crystal having an R.sub.2 TM.sub.14 B phase, wherein      R is neodymium(Nd) and/or praseodymium(Pr), TM is iron(Fe) and/or      cobalt(Co), and B is boron, as a major phase with a mean grain size of 500      nm or less, and the rare earth element-iron alloy contains 13 to 15 atomic      percent of neodymium(Nd) and/or praseodymium(Pr), 5 to 7 atomic percent of      boron(B), and the balance of iron(Fe) and/or cobalt(Co). If the rare earth      element-iron-boron alloy contains less than 13 atomic percent of Nb or Pr,      more than 7 atomic percent or less than 5 atomic percent of B, or more      than 20 atomic percent of Co, it is difficult to subject the billet to      plastic deformation by allowing a current to pass through the billet.      Also, if the amount of Nd or Pr is more than 15 atomic percent, the excess      amount of Nd or Pr oozes out of the billet, which causes the reduction of      smooth release of the billet from the mold cavity, and the reduction of      the residual induction derived from the reduction of the saturation      magnetization. On the other hand, the grain size of the major phase is      adjusted to 500 nm or less because such a maximum grain size of the major      phase that a single magnetic domain can be formed is about 300 nm, and if      the grain size of the major phase is more than 300 nm, especially 500 nm,      the resulting magnet has less intrinsic coercivity, and larger temperature      coefficient of intrinsic coercivity, causing the reduction of the thermal      resistance, regardless of the variety of alloy compositions. </PAR><PAR>  Also, a rapid solidification powder of an R-TM-B-Ga alloy may be mixed with      the aforementioned basis rapid solidification powder of R-TM-B alloy,      wherein R is neodymium(Nd) and/or praseodymium(Pr), TM is iron(Fe) and/or      cobalt(Co), B is boron, and Ga is gallium, in this invention. The rapid      solidification powder of the R-TM-B-Ga alloy is prepared by adding 0.2-2      atomic percent of Ga to the rapid solidification powder of the R-TM-B      alloy. The addition of the rapid solidification powder of the R-TM-B-Ga      alloy has such an advantage that even when a thinner magnet is formed by      subjecting the billet of the rapid solidification powder to plastic      deformation by applying the secondary current, the reduction of intrinsic      coercivity of the magnet can be prevented, thereby maintaining the thermal      stability of the magnet. The amount of addition of the R-TM-B-Ga alloy,      varied depending on the shapes of the magnet, is about 10-20% by weight      for the total amount of the rapid solidification powder of the R-TM-B      alloy for preventing the reduction of the residual induction when a      thinner magnet of about 1 mm thickness is molded. Also, when only the      rapid solidification powder of the R-TN-B alloy or R-TM-B-Ga alloy is      used, the maximum energy product of the magnet is decreased as Fe is      replaced with Co. However, when the rapid solidification powder of the      R-TM-B-Ga alloy is mixed with the rapid solidification powder of the      R-TM-B alloy, the maximum energy product of the magnet is not decreased      significantly even in the presence of up to 18 atomic percent of Co, which      may improve the temperature coefficient of the residual induction while      maintaining the performance of the magnet. </PAR><PAR>  Moreover, other elements such as Zn, Al, Si, Nb, Ta, Ti, Zr, Hf, W, and the      like which prevent the growth of the crystal grains of the rapid      solidification powder, and increase the intrinsic coercive force of the      magnet may be add to the R-TM-B alloy and/or R-TM-B-Ga alloy in such an      amount that the addition of these elements does not reduce the residual      induction of the magnet, significantly. </PAR><PAR>  The following illustrates the billet of a rapid solidification powder of a      rare earth element-iron alloy. </PAR><PAR>  The billet of a rapid solidification powder of a rare earth      element-iron-boron alloy is preferably formed by fixing the flake rapid      solidification powder with a grain size of 53 .mu.m or more. This is      because using a billet prepared by fixing the rapid solidification powder      with a grain size of less than 53 .mu.m, the intrinsic coercivity of the      magnet is reduced. Also, the relative density of the billet is adjusted to      95% or less so as to prevent the reduction of the intrinsic coercivity. </PAR><PAR>  The ratio of the sectional area S of the cavity to the sectional area      S.sub.o of the billet, S/S.sub.o is preferably adjusted to 2 to 3 in which      both sectional areas are located at the right angle of the applied      pressure. If the ratio S/S.sub.o is less than 2, the resulting magnet does      not have a residual induction of 11 kG or more. On the other hand, if the      ratio S/S.sub.o is more than 3, the residual induction is not increased      sufficiently, relative to the degree of the plastic deformation, which      causes the decrease of the intrinsic coercivity. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLES </PAC><PAR>  The following example illustrate the present invention in detail. In these      examples, the magnetic properties of the magnets were measured by using a      recording flux meter at the temperature of 20.andplus;-.5.degree. C. after a 50      kOe pulse magnetization. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAR>  An Nd.sub.14 Fe.sub.76 Co.sub.4 B.sub.6 alloy was melted in an induction      heating furnace, and the melted alloy was subjected to melt-spinning under      Ar atmosphere to obtain a ribbon flake. It was identified from an X-ray      diffraction that the ribbon flake was a mixture of crystalline structures      and amorphous structures having an indeterminate shape with about 30 .mu.m      thickness. The ribbon flake was ground to a grain size of 53-350 .mu.m,      sieved, and charged into a mold cavity in the amount of 16 g. Then, a      billet was formed by allowing a current to pass through it for heating      under vacuum atmosphere of 10.sup.-1 to 10.sup.-3 Torr. The billet had a      cylindrical shape with an outer diameter of 14 mm, and a relative density      of 85%. </PAR><PAR>  Then, the billet 1 was placed in the plastic deformation molding cavity      shown in FIG. 1, which was comprised of a pair of electrode parts 2a and      2a' with an outer diameter of 19,960 mm and length of 5 mm at the side of      the billet, a pair of electrode parts 2b and 2b' with an outer diameter of      19.95 mm and length of 20 mm at the other side, and an electrically      non-conductive die 3 with an inner diameter of 20.00 mm and length of 40      mm. The electrode parts 2a and 2a' were made from TiN/SIALON composite      ceramics having specific electric resistance (.rho.) of 4.times.10.sup.-4      .OMEGA.cm at room temperature, while the electrode parts 2b and 2b' were      made from graphite having specific electric resistance (.rho.) of      1.6.times.10.sup.-3 .OMEGA.cm at room temperature. On the top surface of      the electrode parts 2a and 2a', film of a mixture including boron      nitride(BN) and an organic polymer was formed. The electrically      non-conductive die 3 was made from SIALON. </PAR><PAR>  First, the deformation device was evacuated to a vacuum atmosphere of      10.sup.-1 to 10.sup.-3 Torr. Then, while applying a uniaxial pressure to      the billet 1 through the electrodes 2 and 2', the composite films were      subjected partially to dielectric breakdown by discharging between the      electrodes 2 and 2' over 15 seconds to ensure the electric conductivity      between the electrodes 2 and 2'. Because the discharging current between      the electrodes 2 and 2' was several mA or less, the temperature increase      by Joule's heat was hardly observed in the billet 1. </PAR><PAR>  Then, a primary pressure P.sub.1 of 300 kgf/cm.sup.2 per unit sectional      area of the billet was applied to the billet 1 through the electrodes 2      and 2' while allowing a primary current I.sub.1 of 300 A/cm.sup.2 per unit      sectional area of the billet to pass through the billet 1, thereby heating      the electrodes 2 and 2', billet 1, and die 3 by Joule's heat. The      temperature of the billet 1 was increased much more rapidly than that of      the die 3. Only about 20 seconds after the primary current I.sub.1 started      to pass, the billet 1 was subjected to plastic deformation, and about 40      seconds later, the rate of the plastic deformation reached its maximum      value under the primary pressure P.sub.1. After the maximum value of the      rate of the plastic deformation was observed, the secondary pressure      P.sub.2 of 250 kgf/cm.sup.2 per unit sectional area of the mold cavity was      applied to the billet 1 instead of the primary pressure P.sub.1, and then      the secondary current I.sub. 2 of 800 A was allowed to pass through the      billet 1 for 20 seconds to mold it in a specific shape. The resulting rare      earth element-iron-boron magnet was cooled for 120 seconds, and released      from the mold cavity. The rare earth element-iron magnet had an outer      diameter of 19.990-20.000 mm, and a length of 6.74.andplus;-.0.015 mm with      excellent dimensional precision. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 shows the recoil curves of the magnets mentioned above. As can be      seen from FIG. 3, this magnet is a pinning-type magnet of which the      movement of its magnetic domain wall is pinned. The rare earth      element-iron-boron magnet has a residual induction of 11.5 kG, intrinsic      coercivity of 15 kOe, and maximum energy product of 31 MGOe. The recoil      curves refer to 4 .pi.I-H curves of a magnet obtained when a magnetic      field is reversed from the opposing field. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 2 </PAC><PAR>  The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that the typical production      conditions of the rare earth element-iron-boron magnet were changed. The      following illustrates the relationship between these production conditions      and the magnetic properties of the resulting magnet. </PAR><PAC>  Effect of the primary current value </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 4 shows the relationship between the primary current value and the      current time, and the magnetic properties of the resulting magnet, i.e.,      the intrinsic coercivity H.sub.CJ, the residual induction B.sub.r, and the      maximum energy product BH.sub.max. When the primary current value is 250      A/cm.sup.2 or less per unit sectional area of the billet, a long period of      time T is required for plastic deformation because of less amount of      Joule's heat generated, and as a result the intrinsic coercivity H.sub.CJ      of the magnet is decreased. On the other hand, when the primary current is      400 A/cm.sup.2 or more per unit sectional area of the billet, more Joule      heat is generated than that which is leaked by contact of the billet and      the mold at the crystallization temperature or higher, resulting in the      reduction of the intrinsic coercivity H.sub.CJ of the magnet. </PAR><PAC>  Effect of the ratio of specific electric resistance to volume specific heat </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 5 shows the relationship between the ratio of specific electric      resistance to volume specific heat and the current time, and the magnetic      properties of the resulting magnet, i.e., the intrinsic coercivity      H.sub.CJ, the residual induction B.sub.r, and the maximum energy product      BH.sub.max. If the ratio of specific electric resistance to volume      specific heat is 10.sup.-4 or less, the current time T is several hundred      seconds, therefore the recoil curve becomes less angular. As a result, the      maximum energy product BH.sub.max of the magnet will be decreased. On the      other hand, if the ratio of specific electric resistance to volume      specific heat is more than 10.sup.-2, the desirable primary current level      cannot be attained by applying only a low voltage, so a long period of      time T is required for heating the billet to the crystallization      temperature. Also, the temperature of the billet is increased rapidly at      the crystallization temperature or higher due to the larger amount of      Joule's heat generated than that which is leaked by contact of the billet      and the mold, resulting in the reduction of the intrinsic coercivity      H.sub.CJ of the magnet. As can be seen from the aforementioned      description, it is necessary to adjust the ratio of specific electric      resistance to volume specific heat to the range of 10.sup.-4 to 10.sup.-2. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 shows the relationship between the maximum temperature of the billet      and the mean grain size of the crystals of the magnet. Also, FIG. 7 shows      the relationship between the mean grain size of the crystals of the magnet      and its intrinsic coercivity H.sub.CJ. As can be seen from both figures,      when the maximum temperature of the billet is more than 750.degree. C.,      rapid growth of the grain size of the crystals occurs, so that the      intrinsic coercivity H.sub.CJ of the magnet will be decreased. </PAR><PAR>  The maximum temperature of the billet in this invention depends on the      ratio of specific electric resistance to volume specific heat, the ratio      of the heat capacity of the electrodes at the side of the billet to that      of the electrodes at the other side, and the current density. It is      necessary to maintain the temperature of the billet between the      crystallization temperature and 750.degree. C. for at least ten to one      hundred seconds. </PAR><PAC>  Effect of the primary pressure </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 8 shows the relationship between the primary pressure per unit      sectional area of the billet and the magnetic properties of the resulting      magnet, i.e., the intrinsic coercivity H.sub.CJ, the residual induction      B.sub.r, and the maximum energy product BH.sub.max. The primary pressure      has almost no effect on the magnetic properties. However, it is preferred      that the plastic deformation of the billet is conducted under a low      pressure of 200 kgf/cm.sup.2 per unit sectional area of the billet because      of practical reasons such as the durability of the mold. </PAR><PAC>  Effect of the secondary pressure </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 9 shows the relationship between the secondary pressure per unit      sectional area of the mold cavity and the magnetic properties of the      resulting magnet, i.e., the intrinsic coercivity H.sub.CJ, the residual      induction B.sub.r, and the maximum energy product BH.sub.max. Preferably,      the primary pressure is replaced by the secondary pressure in such a range      that the plastic deformation rate of the billet is between its peak level      and 10.sup.-4 mm/s, so the effect of the secondary pressure on the      magnetic properties of the resulting magnet will be negligible. </PAR><PAR>  The secondary pressure level has an effect on the intrinsic coercivity      H.sub.CJ, the residual induction B.sub.r,and the maximum energy product      BH.sub.max of the magnet. If the secondary pressure is 200 kgf/cm.sup.2 or      less, the intrinsic coercivity H.sub.CJ will be at a low level. On the      other hand, if the secondary pressure is 400 kgf/cm.sup.2 or more, the      maximum energy product BH.sub.max will become low because residual      induction is lowered and the recoil curve becomes less angular. Therefore,      the secondary pressure is usually 200-400 kgf/cm.sup.2 , preferably      250-300 kgf/cm.sup.2. Additionally, it is desirable that the primary      pressure be about the value of (0.2-1.0).times.P.sub.2 (i.e., the      secondary pressure) to ensure a stable electrical connection between the      billet and the electrodes. </PAR><PAC>  Effect of the degree of vacuum </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 10 shows the relationship between the degree of vacuum and the      magnetic properties of the resulting magnet, i.e., the intrinsic      coercivity, the residual induction B.sub.r, and the maximum energy product      BH.sub.max. When the degree of vacuum is in the range of 1.2 to 10.sup.-2      Torr, it has no effect on the magnetic properties of the magnet. Even when      the plastic deformation is conducted under atmospheric pressure, the      magnetic properties such as intrinsic coercivity H.sub.CJ of the magnet      are not damaged, significantly. However, in order to ensure the durability      of the mold to oxidation, it is advantageous to use the degree of vacuum      of about 1.2 to 10.sup.-2 Torr. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 3 </PAC><PAR>  The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that the amount of      neodymium(Nd) was changed. FIG. 11 shows the relationship between the      amount of neodymium and the magnetic properties of the resulting magnet,      i.e., the intrinsic coercivity H.sub.CJ, the residual magnetization      B.sub.r, and the maximum energy product BH.sub.max. If the amount of      neodymium is less than 12 atomic percent, it is difficult to subject the      rare earth element-iron-boron rapid solidification powder to plastic      deformation in the range of the crystallization temperature to 750.degree.      C. In order to conduct the plastic deformation, the rapid solidification      powder must be heated to an elevated temperature of 750.degree. C. or      more, so that the fine crystals of the rapid solidification powder become      larger, which may cause the reduction of its intrinsic coercivity      H.sub.CJ, and residual induction B.sub.r. Also, the resulting magnet,      because it is mechanically fragile, is not suitable for practical use. On      the other hand, if the amount of neodymium is more than 15 atomic percent,      a large scale of flash is formed in the space between the mold cavity and      the electrodes because the neodymium is oozed into the space, causing the      reduction of release of the magnet. It also causes the reduction of      residual induction of the magnet due to the decrease of the saturation      magnetization. Therefore, it is preferred that the amount of neodymium is      adjusted to the range of 12 to 15 atomic percent. </PAR><PAC>  Example 4 </PAC><PAR>  The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that the grain size of the      flake rapid solidification powder, the relative density of the billet, and      the ratio f the sectional are S of the cavity to the sectional are S.sub.o      of the billet were changed. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 12 shows the relationship between the grain size of the flake rapid      solidification powder and the magnetic properties of the resulting magnet,      i.e., the intrinsic coercivity H.sub.CJ, the residual induction B.sub.r,      and the maximum energy product BH.sub.max. If the grain size of the rapid      solidification powder is less than 53 .mu.m, the intrinsic coercivity      H.sub.CJ of the magnet will be decreased. Therefore, it is preferred that      the rapid solidification powder flake does not contain any fine powder      which has a grain size of less than 53 .mu.m. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 13 shows the relationship between the relative density of the billet      and the magnetic properties of the resulting magnet, i.e., the intrinsic      coercivity H.sub.CJ, the residual induction B.sub.r, and the maximum      energy product BH.sub.max. If the relative density is more than 95%, the      intrinsic coercivity H.sub.CJ, the residual induction B.sub.r, and the      maximum energy product BH.sub.max of the magnet will be reduced.      Therefore, it is preferred that the relative density of the rapid      solidification powder is 95% or less. However, if the relative density of      the rapid solidification powder is 80% or less, the billet may buckle      because of the reduction of the compressive strength of the billet. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 14 shows the relationship between the ratio of the sectional are S of      the cavity to the sectional are S.sub.o of the billet and the magnetic      properties of the resulting magnet, i.e., the intrinsic coercivity      H.sub.CJ, the residual induction B.sub.r, and the maximum energy product      BH.sub.max. If the ratio, S/S.sub.o is 2 or less, the magnet does not have      sufficient magnetic anisotropy because of its low residual induction.      However, if the ratio S/S.sub.o is 2 to 3, the rare earth      element-iron-boron magnet having the residual induction B.sub.r of about      11 kG can be obtained. </PAR><PAC>  Example 5 </PAC><PAR>  The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that the secondary current      value was changed.

It was identified from an      X-ray diffraction that the ribbon flake was a mixture of crystalline      structure and amorphous structures having an indeterminate shape with      about 30 .mu.m thickness. The ribbon flake was ground to a grain size of      53-350 .mu.m, sieved, and charged into a mold cavity in an amount of 2.30      g. Then, a billet was formed by heating the ribbon flake while allowing a      current to pass through it under a vacuum atmosphere of 10.sup.-1 to      10.sup.-3 Torr. The billet had a ring shape with an outer diameter of 18.5      mm, inner diameter of 13.5 mm, and a relative density of 80-90%. </PAR><PAR>  Then, the billet mentioned above was placed in the plastic deformation      molding cavity shown in FIG. 1, which was comprised of a pair of      cylindrical electrode parts 2a and 2a' with an outer diameter of 22 mm,      inner diameter of 10 mm, and length of 5 mm at the side of the billet, a      pair of cylindrical electrode parts 2b and 2b' with an outer diameter of      22 mm, inner diameter of 10 mm, and length of 20 mm at the other side, and      an electrically non-conductive die 3 with an inner diameter of 22.05 mm      and length of 40 mm. The electrode parts 2a and 2a' were made from      TiN/SIALON composite ceramics having a ratio of specific electric      resistance to volume specific heat (.rho.) of 4.times.10.sup.-4 .OMEGA.cm      while the electrode parts 2b and 2b' were made from graphite having a      ratio of specific electric resistance to volume specific heat (.rho.) of      1.6.times.10.sup.-3 .OMEGA.cm. On the top surface of the electrode parts      2a and 2a', a film of a mixture including boron nitride(BN) and an organic      polymer was formed. The electrically non-conductive die 3 was made from      SIALON. Also, cores made form SUS304 were inserted into the hollow parts      of the billet and the electrodes, which have outer diameters of 9.95 mm. </PAR><PAR>  First, the deformation device was evacuated to a vacuum atmosphere of      10.sup.-1 to 10.sup.-3 Torr. Then, the composite film was subjected to      dielectric breakdown by discharging it between the electrodes 2 and 2'      over 15 seconds while applying a uniaxial pressure to the billet 1 through      the electrodes 2 and 2' to ensure the electric conductivity between the      electrodes 2 and 2'. The discharging current between the electrodes 2 and      2' was less than several mA, so the temperature increase derived from      Joule's heat generated from the current was hardly observed in the billet      1. </PAR><PAR>  Then, a primary pressure P.sub.1 of 125 kgf/cm.sup.2 per unit sectional are      of the electrode was applied to the billet 1 through the electrodes 2 and      2' while allowing a primary current I.sub.1 of 160 A/cm.sup.2 per unit      sectional area of the electrode to pass through the billet 1, thereby      heating the electrodes 2 and 2', billet 1, die 3, and cores by Joule's      heat generated from the primary current. The temperature of the billet 1      was increased such rapidly than that of the die 3. Only in about 20      seconds after applying the primary current I.sub.1, the billet 1 was      subjected to plastic deformation, and about 40 seconds later, the rate of      the plastic deformation reached its maximum value under the primary      pressure P.sub.1. After the maximum rate of the plastic deformation was      observed, the primary pressure P.sub.1 was replaced by the secondary      pressure P.sub.2 of 250 kgf/cm.sup.2 per unit sectional area of the      electrode applied to the billet 1, and then the secondary current I.sub.2      of 300 A/cm.sup.2 per unit sectional area of the electrode was allowed to      pass through the billet 1 for 20 seconds to form a rare earth      element-iron-boron magnet with a specific shape. The resulting rare earth      element-iron-boron magnet was cooled for 120 seconds, and released out of      the mold cavity. The hollow-flat rare earth element-iron-boron magnet had      an outer diameter of 22.05 mm, an inner diameter of 10.02 mm and a length      of 0,1.0.andplus;-.0.02 mm with excellent dimensional precision. </PAR><PAR>  Table 3 illustrates the magnetic properties of hollow-flat rare earth      element-iron-boron magnets, which are for example obtained from a billet      of a mixture of an

solidification powder was subject to plastic deformation for providing it      with magnetic anisotropy under pressure by heating with Joule's heat      generated from a current to form a hollow-flat magnet with about 1 mm      thickness, radial cracks occurred on the magnet. On the other hand, when      the amount of neodymium(Nd) is increased to 16 atomic %, a magnet with a      specific shape can easily be formed due to less resistance to plastic      deformation, but high residual induction cannot be obtained in the magnet      because of the reduction of saturation magnetization. By using a billet of      a mixture of an R-TM-B type alloy and R-TM-B-Ga type alloy, a magnet with      a high residual induction of 11 kG or more can be produced in a specific      shape. The resulting magnet has also a high intrinsic coercivity of 14 kOe      or more, which ensures excellent thermal stability of magnetic properties. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 17 shows the relationship between the intrinsic coercivity and the      residual induction of hollow-flat rare earth element-iron-boron rapid      solidification magnets with an outer diameter of 22 mm, inner diameter of      10 mm, and thickness of 1 mm or 4 mm, when compared to the rare earth      element-iron-boron sintered magnets with the same outer and inner      diameters, and thickness of 1.15 mm or 4 mm which were produced by a      powder metallurgy method.

This is because      the direction of the pressure applied to the magnet is identical to the      axis of easy magnetization. On the other hand, because the direction of      the applied magnetic field is identical to the direction of pressure in      the rare earth element-iron-boron sintered magnet, when a thinner magnet      is produced, the orientation of the magnet is much more disturbed, which      causes the reduction of residual induction. </PAR><PAR>  It is understood that various other modifications will be apparent to and      can be readily made by those skilled in the art without departing from the      scope and spirit of this invention.
