Digital general-purpose and fluoroscopicradiology systems are being clinically evaluated. Digitizing conventionalx-ray films, such as mammograms, frequently improves the diagnostic qualityof the images. The digitizing process with laser has also afforded theopportunity to document required spatial resolution for digital imagingand network systems. The use of digitally formatted image instrumentationimposes new requirements on the acquisition, display and manipulation,transmission, hard copy image recording, and archiving of diagnosticdata. Networking of digitally formatted image data offers many advantagesfor managing digital information. This paper identifies and describesdigital radiographic systems. Parameters required for designing and implementinga digital image management system are outlined. Spatial and contrastresolution requirements are identified. The key parameters include theamount of image data generated each working day, the retrieval rate ofthe generated data, the display hardware and software needed for interactivediagnosis display stations, the requirements for analog hard copy generation,and on-line and long-term archiving requirements. These image managementsystems are often called PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication Systems).</TEXT></DOC>
