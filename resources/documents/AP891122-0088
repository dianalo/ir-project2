Protest leaders threatened a general strike Monday to presstheir demands.   For the first time, government television carried livebroadcasts of the protest in downtown Wenceslas Square, showinginterviews with actors at the demonstration interspersed with filmof rock bands.   But an announcer then came on the air and said the broadcastswere being temporarily stopped because some employees of theCzechoslovak state television did not agree with them.   This was after they had shown a worker, a Communist Party memberfor 20 years, who questioned official accounts of a demonstrationFriday that was brutally dispersed by police.   ``What is the government afraid of? They may be afraid becausethey are lying to us for 20 years,'' said the worker, identified asHonza Lexa.   Demonstrators chanted, ``Jakes to the dustbin!'' referring tohard-line Communist Party boss Milos Jakes, who unlike other Eastbloc leaders has resisted reforms introduced by Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev.   The country's leading human rights activist, playwright VaclavHavel, was greeted with chants of ``Long live Havel!''   ``Those who have for long years made bloody vengeance to thosewho opposed them are now afraid of us,'' Havel told the crowd.``After 20 years of timelessness, history is coming back to thiscountry.''   Elsewhere in Czechsolovakia, 80,000 students and intellectualsstaged sit-in strikes and vowed to go ahead with a general strikenext week. They claimed growing worker support, despiteconciliatory moves by the Communist premier.   Sharp divisions emerged in the ruling elite.   While Jakes has maintained a hard line against the protesters,Premier Ladislav Adamec on Tuesday met with a delegation thatincluded prominent dissidents, an unprecedented event that all butlegitimized the burgeoning opposition movement.   Members of the group said Adamec was conciliatory, telling themauthorities were open to dialogue with the opposition, whoseleaders have long been harrassed by police and jailed on charges ofanti-socialist agitation.   He reportedly told them that neither martial law nor policeforce would be used to block protests.   Church sources said a Jakes ally met today with Roman CatholicCardinal Frantisek Tomasek, who lent his influential voice to thepro-democracy movement in a strongly worded appeal Tuesday.   The sources, who asked not to be identified, said Tomasak'smeeting with hard-line Prague Communist Party boss Miroslav Stepanfocused on a planned Mass Saturday that could become a focus fordemands for more religious freedom.   In the southern city of Bratislava, 200 people today prayed andcalled for freedom outside the Palace of Justice in a protesturging the release of dissident Jan Carnogursky on trial forsedition and subversion.   Well-informed sources who spoke on condition of anonymity saidthe Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee wouldprobably meet on Friday to discuss the burgeoning political crisis.   The state-run media, which has begun reporting criticism of thegovernment, estimated 80,000 students holding sit-in strikes atPrague University and other schools around the country. Thestudents have called a two-hour general strike for Monday and claimgrowing support from the workers.   Jan Ruml, one of the four members of the newly formed CivicForum who attended the talks with Adamec, said the group wassticking to its demands for the resignation of Jakes, Stepan andother top leaders.   ``We unequivocably support the strike of students, theater andcreative artists and support a general strike on Nov. 27,'' headded.   Vladimir Hanzal, a musician, told a packed Civic Forum newsconference that 1,400 workers at Prague's CKD factory _ the city'sbiggest industrial enterprise _ had voted to join the generalstrike.   The information could not be independently confirmed. Theofficial youth daily Mlada Fronta quoted an unidentified worker atthe factory as saying employees would join the student-led strike,then make up the two hours of missed work later.   More than 150,000 people rallied on Prague's central WenceslasSquare on Tuesday, emboldened by the tide of democratic change thatis ending one-party rule in Poland and Hungary and has broughtbroad changes to East Germany.   Thousands of other protesters gathered in at least 14 othercities and towns. The large-scale provincial demonstrations werethe first since a 1968 Soviet-led invasion crushed the ``PragueSpring'' reform movement.   Havel and others spoke from the balcony of the building housingoffices of Svobodne Slovo, the voice of the Socialist Party and thefirst official newspaper to denounce the police repression of arally Friday in Prague. Police have since shown restraint.   Adamec, according to the people who met him, said he approved ofa ``different concept of the leading role of the (Communist)party'' but that socialism must be protected.   The party's leading role is laid down in the CzechoslovakConstitution.   Adamec also said, according to the group members, that hefavored including non-communists in his government.</TEXT></DOC>
