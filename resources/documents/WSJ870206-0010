Money fund assets rose $1.76 billion to $236.02 billion in the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade association, said.    The gain was the first significant change in asset levels after weeks of fluctuations.    &quot;Institutional investors added modestly to their money market fund holdings this week as short-term rates drifted downward,&quot; said Ann Anderson, assistant vice president for research at the institute.    &quot;Individual shareholders may have taken some profits in the continuing strong bull market,&quot; she added, &quot;and temporarily placed these assets in money market mutual funds.&quot;    Assets of 196 general purpose funds were up $475.5 million to $62.83 billion; assets of 92 broker-dealer funds rose $789.3 million to $107.42 billion. Assets of 91 institutional funds gained $492.3 million to $65.77 billion.    The average seven-day yield for funds, in the week ended Tuesday, dropped to 5.31% from 5.34% a week earlier, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter. The average 30-day yield for funds fell to 5.41% from 5.63%, and the average maturity of funds fell to 48 days from 50 days.    Banks, which compete with money funds, were paying an average yield of 5.14% on their money market savings accounts in the week ended Wednesday, compared with 5.18% the week before, according to Banxquote Online, a New York-based information service. Bank yields were 5.59% for six-month savings certificates of deposit, compared with 5.6% the previous week. Yields were 5.82% for one-year bank savings CDs, compared with 5.84%. </TEXT></DOC>
