But about 20,000 who got visas in past months havecome back, unable to find good jobs or housing in Turkey.   The Turks have been fleeing a sometimes-violent campaign byBulgarian authorities, going back to 1984, to force them to useBulgarian names, curtail their Moslem religious rites and stopspeaking Turkish in public.   Diplomats in Sofia say many of the Turks who have returned faceprosecution, although they have no details of such cases. They alsosay the Turks often are forbidden to return to their previous jobsand homes, partly due to an acute labor shortage in some areas thathas prompted authorities to shift manual labor to crucialconstruction projects and industries.   The official Bulgarian news agency, BTA, has reported the returnrate at 500 to 1,000 a day.   A Turkish diplomat in Sofia said, however, that ethnic Turks``still want to leave Bulgaria as vigorously as before.''   ``You can see for yourself. There are some 2,000 people waitingaround our consulate every day,'' he said.   About 320,000 of Bulgaria's 1.5 million ethnic Turks began inmid-year to leave for Turkey. Bulgaria deported some of them.Others emigrated under new liberalized passport regulations. Manyhad their possessions seized before leaving, and their arrivalstrained Turkish abilities to absorb them.   On Aug. 22, Premier Turgut Ozal of Turkey closed the border tothe ethnic Turks, requiring them to obtain regular visas. His move,part of an attempt to persuade Bulgaria to safeguard the propertyof those seeking to settle in Turkey, was widely seen as adiplomatic victory for Bulgaria's Communist government over Turkey,which had asserted at one point that it would welcome any BulgarianTurk facing persecution.   Now that Turkey is no longer absorbing large new groups ofethnic Turks, the situation of people wanting to emigrate hasbecome even more precarious. About 25,000 would-be emigrants arestranded in Bulgaria. Most have sold their houses and otherbelongings.   A Turkish diplomat said his mission now is to issue visas onlyfor family reunification and other urgent case.   ``In all, we are interviewing about 800 people a day,'' he said.Only a handful, perhaps a dozen or so, receive visas each day.   ``With the numbers we have given out for visa applicants, we arealready in the mid-1990s,'' he said of a waiting list forinterviews.   Long lines reportedly also have formed outside the Turkishconsulates in Varna on the Black Sea and the southern industrialtown of Plovdiv.   Several diplomats in Sofia asserted that 500,000 more ethnicTurks may want to emigrate to Turkey.   But Bulgaria continues to balk at a new emigration accord withTurkey that would set out in detail such things as property rightsand social security claims.   ``Such a new immigration agreement would limit the free movementof our people under the Helsinki accords'' on human rights, saidChavdar Mladenov of the Foreign Ministry. Bulgaria has come underheavy Western criticism over the issue.   Officially, Bulgaria has stopped referring to a Turkish minorityin the country. Officials and newspapers now invariably speak of``Bulgarian Moslems.''   Maldenov asserted flatly that there are no Turks in Bulgaria.   Turks indeed have left some of the villages in the Razgrad area,270 miles northeast of Sofia.   ``Of 400 families, 300 left'' for Turkey, said one of thehandful of farmers in one village.   In Mortagonovo, another predominantly Turkish village, a frailman in his late 70s sat on a bench, his prayer beads glidingthrough his fingers.   He was asked if he planned to leave.   ``I was waiting in a camp down south for 15 days. Then theyclosed the border,'' he said in halting Bulgarian. ``I sold myhouse before I left. Now I'm staying with my son.''</TEXT></DOC>
