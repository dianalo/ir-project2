General Authority and Preemption under the HMTASection 112(a) of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA) (49App. U.S.C. 1811(a)) preempts ``* * * any requirement, of a State or politicalsubdivision thereof, which is inconsistent with any requirement set forthin [the HMTA], or in a regulation issued under [the HMTA].'' This expresspreemption makes it evident that Congress did not intend the HMTA and itsregulations to completely occupy the field of transportation so as to precludeany state or local action. The HMTA preempts only those state and localrequirements that are ``inconsistent.''In the HMTA's Declaration of Policy (section 102) and in the Senate CommerceCommittee language reporting out what became section 112 of the HMTA, Congressindicated a desire for uniform national standards in the field of hazardousmaterials transportation. Congress inserted the preemption language insection 112(a) ``in order to preclude a multiplicity of state and localregulations and the potential for varying as well as conflicting regulationsin the area of hazardous material transportation'' (S. Rep. No. 1192, 93rdCong., 2d Sess., 37 (1974)). Through its enactment of the HMTA, Congressgave the Department the authority to promulgate uniform national standards.While the HMTA did not totally preclude state of local action in this area,Congress apparently intended, to the extent possible, to make such stateor local action unnecessary. The comprehensiveness of the Hazardous MaterialsRegulations (HMR), issued to implement the HMTA, severely restricts thescope of historically permissible state or local activity.Although advisory in nature, inconsistency rulings issued by the Officeof Hazardous Materials Transportation (OHMT) and appeals to the Administratorof the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) under 49 CFRPart 107 provide an alternative to litigation for a determination of therelationship between Federal requirements and those of a state or politicalsubdivision. If a state or political subdivision requirement is found tobe inconsistent, the state or local government may apply to RSPA for awaiver of preemption. 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(b); 49 CFR andSection; 107.215through 107.225.In issuing its advisory inconsistency rulings concerning preemption underthe HMTA, RSPA is guided by the principles enunciated in Executive Order12612 entitled ``Federalism'' (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987). Section4(a) of that Executive Order authorizes preemption of state laws only whenthe statute contains an express preemption provision, there is other firmand palpable evidence of Congressional intent to preempt, or the exerciseof state authority directly conflicts with the exercise of Federal authority.The HMTA, of course, contains an express preemption provision, which RSPAhas implemented through regulations and applied in a series of inconsistencyrulings beginning in 1978.Since these proceedings are conducted pursuant to the HMTA, only the questionof statutory preemption under the HMTA will be considered. A court mightfind a non-Federal requirement preempted for other reasons, such as statutorypreemption under another Federal statute, preemption under state law, orpreemption by the Commerce Clause and the Supremacy Clause of the U.S.Constitution because of an undue burden on interstate commerce. However,RSPA does not make such determinations in its inconsistency ruling process.RSPA has incorporated into its procedures (49 CFR 107.209(c)) the followingcriteria for determining whether a state or local requirement is consistentwith, and thus not preempted by, the HMTA:(1) Whether compliance with both the non-Federal requirement and the Actor the regulations issued under the Act is possible; and(2) The extent to which the non-Federal requirement is an obstacle to theaccomplishment and execution of the Act and the regulations issued underthe Act.These criteria are based upon U.S. Supreme Court decisions on preemption.<T3>Hines </T3>v.<T3> Davidowitz</T3>, 312 U.S. 52 (1941): <T3>Florida Lime andamp; Avocado Growers, Inc. </T3>v.<T3> Paul</T3>, 373 U.S. 132 (1963); <T3>Ray </T3>v.<T3> Atlantic Richfield Co</T3>., 435 U.S. 151 (1978).The first criterion, the ``dual compliance'' test, concerns those non-Federalrequirements which are irreconcilable with Federal requirements; that is,compliance with the non-Federal requirement causes the Federal requirementto be violated, or <T3>vice versa.</T3> The second criterion, the ``obstacle'' test, involvesdetermining whether a state or local requirement is an obstacle to accomplishingand executing the HMTA and the HMR; a requirement which is such an obstacleis inconsistent. Application of this second criterion requires an analysisof the non-Federal requirement in light of the requirements of the HMTAand the HMR, as well as the purposes and objectives of Congress in enactingthe HMTA and the manner and extent to which those purposes and objectiveshave been carried out through the OHMT's regulatory program.B. ChronologyOn April 13, 1987, the American Trucking Associations, Inc. and the NationalTank Truck Carriers, Inc. (ATA/NTTC) applied for an administrative rulingto determine whether Directives 3-76, 5-63, 6-76, and 7-74 of the Cityof New York Fire Department's Bureau of Fire Prevention (BFP) are inconsistentwith the HMTA and the HMR, and, therefore, preempted under section 112(a)of the HMTA. BFP Directives 6-76 and 7-74 create permit systems that governthe use of tank trucks which transport combustible or flammable mixtureswithin New York City. BFP Directive 3-76 establishes a City permit systemfor open and closed body platform trucks transporting flammable and combustibleliquids, while Directive 5-63 creates a permit system for the transportationof compressed gases within the City.On May 18, 1987, OHMT published a public notice and invitation to commentsoliciting public comments on the ATA/NTTC application. Detailed commentswere filed by the applicants (together with the National Paint andamp; CoatingsAssociation, Inc.) and by the City of New York (the City). Comments insupport of the ATA/NTTC position were filed by the Union Carbide Corporationand the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.The applicants' request for a similar ruling concerning hazardous materialstime, routing, escort, and other restrictions of the City of New York andthe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is the subject of a separatedocket (IRA-40B). On May 5, 1988, the Director, OHMT, issued InconsistencyRuling 23 (IR-23), which was published at 53 FR 16840 on May 11, 1988.The City appealed IR-23 (53 FR 32184, August 23, 1988) and a separate decisionaddressing that appeal will be issued.On December 2, 1987, the Director, OHMT, issued Inconsistency Ruling 22(IR-22), which was published at 52 FR 46574 on December 8, 1987 (correction,52 FR 49107, December 29, 1987). The Director determined that the City'spermitting system for transportation of certain hazardous materials isinconsistent with the HMTA and the HMR and, therefore, preempted. The Directorfound that the City created its own independent set of cargo containment,equipment and related requirements that overlap extensive HMR requirements,are likely to encourage noncompliance with the HMR, and concern subjectsthat RSPA has determined are its exclusive province under the HMTA. Furthermore,he found that the City's directives result in serious delays in the transportationof hazardous materials.For these reasons, the Director determined that BFP Directives 3-76 (exceptsessions 13 and 16), 6-76 (except section 25), 7-74 (except sections 31and 32 and subsections 2-2 and 2-3), and 5-63 (except section 7) are inconsistentwith the HMTA and the HMR and, therefore, preempted under section 112(a)of the HMTA (49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a)). Sections 13 and 16 of BFP Directive3-76, section 25 of BFP Directive 6-76, sections 31 and 32 of BFP Directive7-74, and section 7 of BFP Directive 5-63 were found consistent with theHMTA and the HMR. No opinion was rendered concerning subsections 2-2 and2-3 of BFP Directive 7-74.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. The Appeal</ITAG>On February 2, 1988, the City filed an appeal of IR-22 with the Administratorof RSPA. The City filed a memorandum of law (City Memo.) and two extensiveaffidavits in support of its appeal, which was contained in its letterof January 27, 1988. One affidavit is that of the City's Assistant CorporationCounsel Grace Goodman, with exhibits consisting of excerpts from transcriptsof depositions and other materials from a related court action in the U.S.District Court for the Eastern District of New York, <T3>National Paint andamp; Coatings Assn., Inc.</T3> v. <T3>City of New York</T3>, 84 Civ. 4525 (ERK) (<T3>National Paint</T3> case). The other affidavit is that of LawrenceLennon, Director of the Transportation Division of the City's Departmentof Planning, which originally was submitted in opposition to a motion forsummary judgment in the <T3>National Paint</T3> case. The City made the following arguments:(1) There allegedly are factual disputes about the City's regulations whichshould have been resolved before an inconsinstency ruling was issued, andthe City's regulations allegedly meet the ``dual compliance'' test;(2) OHMT allegedly erred in interpreting the law governing preemption underthe HMTA; and(3) OHMT allegedly erred in its application of the law to the City's regulations.On February 24, 1988, RSPA published a public notice and invitation tocomment on the appeal (53 FR 5538). In response, comments were submittedby the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, Fruehauf Corporation-Liquid andamp;Bulk Tank Division, National Private Trucking Association, Truck Rentingand Leasing Association, and ATA/NTTC, together with the National Paintandamp; Coatings Association, Inc. (NPCA). NPCA also submitted a copy ofPlaintiffs' reply brief in the <T3>National Paint</T3> case. Subsequently, rebuttal comments were filedby the City, ``Bomar'' Tank Discharge Systems, Inc., and D.R. Pesuit andamp;Associates.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Decision on Appeal</ITAG>I am issuing this decision in my capacity as Administrator of RSPA. I havethoroughly considered all of the issues raised in the appeal and the discussionsof them in the comments and rebuttal comments. All of the issues beingappealed were discussed exhaustively by the Director of OHMT in IR-22;thus I will respond only to the specifdic issues raised on appeal and generallywill not reiterate the Ruling's discussions, with all of which I fullyconcur.Although all major issues and arguments raised by the City and other commentersare summarized, I have not responded to or commented on many of those whichare irrelevant to my decision. My failure to address any issue or argumentshould not be construed as agreement or disagreement with them.I will discuss and decide each of the issues raised by the City and describedabove in Section II.1. <T3>There Allegedly are Factual Disputes About the City's Regulations WhichShould Have Been Resolved Before an Inconsistency Ruling Was Issued, andthe City's Regulations Allegedly Meet the ``Dual Compliance'' Test.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">a. The City's Arguments</ITAG>The City stated that, despite its request that OHMT refrain from issuinga determination until the factual record could be developed at trial inthe <T3>National Paint </T3>case, OHMT issued IR-22. The City argues that,following the logic of its abstention argument, it did not present to OHMTa point-by-point rebuttal of the applicants' characterizations of the City'sdirectives. However, for purposes of the appeal, the City included a point-by-pointrefutation of the applicants' version of the facts.<ITAG tagnum="81">b. Commenters' Arguments</ITAG>ATA/NTTC argue that OHMT properly decided that its determination concerningthe preemptive effect of its regulations was relevant and would be usefulin the pending <T3>National Paint</T3> case. Furthermore, ATA/NTTC argue that becauseIR-22 determined that the areas regulated by the City are the exclusiveprovince of RSPA under the HMTA, the City's factual arguments are irrelevant.ATA/NTTC Comments at 3.<ITAG tagnum="81">c. Administrator's Decision</ITAG>A threshold problem with the City's factual arguments is that the Cityhas repeatedly and mistakenly construed OHMT's description (in IR-22) ofthe applicants' arguments as OHMT's own findings. For example, the Citystates (City Memo. at 3) that OHMT ``is simply wrong'' that the issuanceof permits ``is a matter of unfettered City discretion because no standardsare specified therefor.'' (quoting 52 FR 46578). The statement the Cityquotes is in Part IV.B., which is captioned ``Applicants' Arguments.''Furthermore, the introduction to that statement reads, in part, ``the followingare among the more significant of those provisions * * * which <T3>the applicants allege are inconsistent</T3> with HMR provisions'' (emphasisadded). 52 FR 46578.A more fundamental problem with the City's factual and ``dual compliance''arguments, however, is that they are irrelevant. The Director of OHMT foundthe BFP Directives to be inconsistent because ``the City has created itsown independent set of cargo containment, equipment and related requirementswhich overlap the extensive HMR requirements, which are likely to encouragenoncompliance with the HMR, and which concern subjects that RSPA has determinedare its exclusive province under the HMTA.'' 52 FR 46583. In short, theDirector's decision was based not on the ``dual compliance'' test but onthe ``obstacle'' test. Even assuming, <T3>arguendo</T3>, that each of the City's requirements, both individuallyand collectively, passed the ``dual compliance'' test, that fact wouldnot be sufficient for a finding of consistency if those same requirementsdo not survive scrutiny under the ``obstacle'' test. Therefore, in thisinstance, no purpose would be served by a point-by-point comparison ofthe City's requirements with the Federal requirements. Furthermore, theCity had ample opportunity to submit rebuttal comments in response to commenters'statements, but did not choose to do so. The City's legal argument thatthe Director failed to correctly apply the tests for inconsistency is discussedbelow under Sections 2 and 3.2. <T3>OHMT Allegedly Erred in Interpreting the Law Governing Preemption Underthe HMTA.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">a. OHMT Allegedly Erred in Not Being Guided By the Prior Decisionof the Federal District Court That Considered These Same Regulations</ITAG>(1) <T3>The City's Arguments.</T3> The City argues that OHMT ``should havedeferred to the opinion of the District Court on those aspects of the lawthat the Court had already considered in a case dealing with the exactsame regulations.'' The opinion to which the City refers was a decisionby the District Court in the <T3>National Paint</T3> case to deny plaintiff's motion for summary judgmentwhich argued that the City's regulations are preempted as a matter of law.The City asserts that the District Court decided Congress did not intendto preempt the fields occupied by the City's regulations; the goal of Congressin enacting the HMTA was not simply uniformity, but safety; and the courtmust look to the HMTA and the HMR directly, rather than to RSPA's administrativerulings and subsequent pronouncements, to determine the preemptive effectof the Federal regulations.(2) <T3>Commenters' Arguments.</T3> ATA/NTTC states that the issue of the priorDistrict Court decision ``was squarely presented to OHMT in IR-22'' and``OHMT properly decided that OHMT's determination concerning the preemptiveeffect of its regulations was relevant and useful.'' ATA/NTTC Commentsat 7. ATA/NTTC argues that Federal District Judge Sifton ``clearly indicatedthe court's special interest in OHMT's interpretation or determinationof the preemptive effect of its regulations.'' They note that ``Judge Siftondid not hold, and could not lawfully have ruled, that OHMT was precludedfrom making that determination, or that the court would have rejected OHMT'sdetermination had it been issued at the time Judge Sifton ruled.'' ATA/NTTCComments at 8. ATA/NTTC further states that OHMT, in IR-22, has now givenits views concerning its intent to occupy the field and the resulting preemptionof State regulations in the same area. ATA/NTTC argues, therefore, thatOHMT correctly interpreted Judge Sifton's opinion. Although Judge Siftonfound that plaintiffs had ``not made a significant showing that federalregulations were intended to occupy the field,'' ATA/NTTC argues that_<ITAG tagnum="21">OHMT has now clearly and unequivocally indicated what the intent ofthe regulations is. Further, as to the City's fundamental defense, thatfederal tank truck regulations are only a minimum standard upon which localgovernments may in the interest of local safety build additional regulatorystructures, Judge Sifton noted that the City's argument was persuasiveonly because OHMT had not rejected it. The Court stated that if plaintiffswere to establish that OHMT had rejected the argument and concluded thatadditional requirements could not be imposed, the City's argument wouldbe unpersuasive.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">ATA/NTTC Comments at 9.Finally, ATA/NTTC notes that ``the Court in the pending [<T3>National Paint</T3>] case invited the parties seeking to void the City'sregulations to file a motion for summary judgment based on the ruling inIR-22.'' ATA/NTTC Comments at 7.(3) <T3>Rebuttal Comments.</T3> The City argues that Judge Sifton's decisionwas correct concerning the lack of categorical preemption as to cargo containmentsystems under the HMTA and the HMR. The City argues that Judge Sifton'sopinion was that the HMR, as to cargo tank requirements, specify that theyare minimum requirements and, therefore, regulations shown to promote ahigher degree of safety (e.g., the City's regulations) could not be anobstacle.(4) <T3>Administrator's Decision. </T3>In response to the City's request thatOHMT abstain from issuing an inconsistency ruling, the Director, OHMT,stated: <ITAG tagnum="21">In light, therefore, of the relevance of OHMT's intent concerningthe preemptive effect of its regulations, the existence of the inconsistencyruling process for the issuance of advisory opinions concerning such issues,and the pendency of judicial proceedings in which an inconsistency rulingmight be useful, OHMT will address the issues raised by the applicants.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">52 FR 46576. The Director reached this decision after considering Judge Sifton's 1985memorandum and order denying plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, anda leading Supreme Court case on preemption which was cited and discussedby Judge Sifton in that memorandum. The City's characterization of Judge Sifton's 1985 memorandum as havingalready decided certain issues for purposes of this case is erroneous.An order denying a motion for summary judgment does not ``decide'' issuesin an administrative proceeding. Furthermore, the City's contention thatthe cargo tank regulations are minimums which the City or any other jurisdictionis free to exceed based on a safety rationale is clearly wrong. RSPA hasstated numerous times, in its HMR rulemaking dockets, written interpretations,and inconsistency rulings, that the HMR generally are minimum requirementswhich <T3>the regulated industry </T3>may exceed so long as the minimum requirementsare met. The HMR are not, and have never been, minimum requirements whichStates or local jurisdictions could unilaterally choose to exceed by imposingadditional obligations on the regulated industry. It is my determinationthat the Director, OHMT, acted properly in issuing IR-22, after consideringthe arguments of both parties to the litigation. Furthermore, as ATA/NTTCnotes, the court in the <T3>National Paint </T3>case requested plaintiffs to file a motion forsummary judgment based on IR-22. The District Court evidently considersIR-22 to be relevant and, as the Director stated in IR-22, ``it is appropriatethat the Federal Court have the benefit of the Agency's views prior tomaking a final decision concerning the preemption issues.'' 52 FR 46576.<ITAG tagnum="81">b. IR-22 Allegedly Is Based On An Erroneous Statement of The Law </ITAG>(1) <T3>IR-22 allegedly fails to apply the proper tests for inconsistency</T3>_(a)<T3>The City's Arguments. </T3>The City argues that despite OHMT's statementthat there is a two-prong test for determining inconsistency, OHMT eitherignored or wrongly applied the ``dual compliance'' prong. The City statesthat the Supreme Court held, in <T3>Hines </T3>v. <T3>Davidowitz, supra, </T3>that ``determination of the absence of `actualconflict' should come before any `inquiry into congressional design,' becausethe presence of such conflict would make the further inquiry unnecessary.''The City asserts that in IR-22, OHMT stopped its inquiry at the point ofdetermining that differing regulations exist, and did not inquire as towhether these differences conflict. (b) <T3>Commenters' Arguments. </T3>ATA/NTTC state that ``the legislative historyof Section 1811 provides a clear picture of what Congress meant by `inconsistent'and the degree to which Congress extended to OHMT the responsibility topreempt a field when necessary to accomplish the objectives of the HMR.''ATA/NTTC Comments at 11. ATA/NTTC argue that the City's position that aninconsistency ruling ``must evaluate <T3>both </T3>whether the City's regulations are an obstacle to achievingthe goals of the HMTA <T3>and </T3>whether an actual conflict exists between the HMR and theCity's regulations'' is ``incorrect and reflects a fundamental misunderstandingof preemption law.'' ATA/NTTC Comments at 13. ATA/NTTC state that the SupremeCourt has repeatedly held that state law can be preempted in either oftwo general ways: (1) Where Congress has evidenced an intent to occupya given field, or (2) where it is impossible to comply with both stateand federal law or the state law stands as an obstacle to accomplishmentof the purposes and objectives of Congress. Because the HMTA did not totallypreclude state or local action in the field of hazardous materials transportation,ATA/NTTC point out that it is the second test with which OHMT is concerned.ATA/NTTC argue, however, that this second test is clearly set in the alternative,and the Supreme Court has ``treated the obstacle and actual conflict testsas separate and independent.'' ATA/NTTC assert that the City's relianceon <T3>Florida Lime and Avocado Growers, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Paul, </T3>373 U.S. 132 (1963) is misplaced, and that ``the City isflatly wrong in asserting that prior HMTA cases [citations omitted] requireboth a `dual compliance' and obstacle analysis.'' ATA/NTTC state that in<T3>Florida Avocado Growers </T3>the Court looked at whether an actualconflict existed but ``did not hold that a proper preemption inquiry mustfirst concern an `actual conflict,' or that both `actual conflict' and`obstacle' analyses must be undertaken.'' ATA/NTTC Comments at 14. In <T3>National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Burke, </T3>535 F. Supp. 509, 517 (D.R.I. 1982), <T3>aff'd, </T3>698 F.2d 559 (1st Cir. 1983), according to ATA/NTTC, the``Court held that Rhode Island's curfew requirement did not directly conflictwith federal requirements but was `inconsistent in that it undermines thefull purposes of the Act and is preempted.''' ATA/NTTC Comments at 17,quoting 535 F. Supp. at 519. Further, in <T3>Missouri Pacific R.R. Co. </T3>v. <T3>R. Comm'n of Texas, </T3>671 F. Supp. 466, 480 (W.D. Tex. 1987) [<T3>aff'd on other grounds, </T3>850 F.2d 264 (5th Cir. 1988), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>109 S. Ct. 794 (1989)], ATA/NTTC note that the DistrictCourt relied solely on the obstacle test in finding certain Texas regulationsto be inconsistent with the HMR. The Texas regulations required a cabooseon all trains over 2,000 feet in length which transported hazardous materials.ATA/NTTC state that there was no evidence that dual compliance was impossible(because the HMR had no applicable regulation) and OHMT had not issuedan inconsistency ruling. Nevertheless, the Court found the Texas regulationsinconsistent under the obstacle test. ATA/NTTC therefore argue that OHMT'sreliance solely on the obstacle test in IR-22 ``was entirely proper andconsistent with case law.'' ATA/NTTC Comments at 18. (c) <T3>Rebuttal Comments. </T3>The City argues that OHMT exceeded its authorityin IR-22 when it expressed an opinion concerning the preemptive effectof its regulations. It argues that OHMT has the authority to express itsintent when promulgating regulations or when explicitly refraining frompromulgating regulations, but that it ``may not now purport to `interpret'the HMR to say that only `uniform' standards are not preempted.'' The Cityasserts that it does not contend that OHMT can never make valid interpretationsof its intention through inconsistency rulings, but that those interpretations``must be based on, and not contradict, the regulations they purport toexplain.'' City Reply Memo. at 7. The City argues that if RSPA has discovereda need for uniformity in the area of cargo containment, it may start anew rulemaking or seek a new statement of intent from Congress. The Cityasserts RSPA has apparently chosen the latter course because in 1987 itsubmitted proposed legislation to Congress which included packaging asone of the areas subject to Federal preemption. (d) <T3>Administrator's Decision. </T3>The City is wrong in contending thatOHMT exceeded its authority by interpreting the cargo containment regulationsas preempting the City's regulations. In IR-22 the Director stated thatFederal regulations in certain areas, including cargo containment, equipment,and related requirements are the exclusive province of the Department ofTransportation. RSPA has stated that position in numerous previous inconsistencyrulings, and reiterated it in IR-22. Therefore, the Director's decisionto apply only the obstacle test was entirely consistent with previous RSPApractice and policy. Furthermore, the Department's submission of proposed legislation to Congressis not evidence of the need to seek a new statement of intention from Congress.The Purpose of the Department's legislative proposal was to codify in thestatute the experience which the Department had gained in administeringthe HMTA since its passage, thereby reducing the potential for conflictbetween Federal and non-Federal requirements. (2) <T3>IR-22 allegedly misinterprets the nature of the dual compliance test._</T3>(a)<T3>The City's Arguments. </T3>The City contends that OHMT has wrongfullyexpanded the test by saying that inconsistency is present not only wherecompliance with the non-Federal requirement would cause the Federal requirementto be violated, but also where compliance with the Federal regulation causesthe non-Federal regulation to be violated. The City contends that caselaw ``is quite specific that it is only where compliance with the statelaw would violate the federal rule, and <T3>not</T3> the other way around, that constitutes actual conflict forpreemption purposes.'' The City cites <T3>Florida Avocado Growers, supra, </T3>and <T3>Jones </T3>v. <T3>Rath Packing Company, </T3>430 U.S. 519, 540 (1977), as standing forthis proposition.The City further contends that OHMT erred in concurring with the applicants'claim that an actual conflict occurs when the City regulates a subjectthat the Federal Government does not regulate at all, simply because thatsubject can be characterized as within a general subject area that is Federallyregulated.(b) <T3>Commenters' Arguments. </T3>ATA/NTTC respond to the City's argumentsby stating that the City misinterprets OHMT's use of the phrase ``<T3>vice versa</T3>'' in its description of the dual compliance test. ATA/NTTCcontend that OHMT properly focused on whether the Federal and non-Federalrequirements are ``irreconcilable.''(c) <T3>Administrator's Decision. </T3>RSPA's understanding of the ``dual compliance''test does not conflict with the City's. The ``dual compliance'' test invalidatesthose non-Federal requirements that are irreconcilable with Federal requirementsbecause compliance with both is physically impossible. The ``dual compliance''test is inapplicable to a situation where the non-Federal requirement isin addition to, or in an area not covered by, a Federal regulation. Obviously,in such a situation, compliance with both the Federal and non-Federal requirementsis possible, and the test for inconsistency thus is whether the non-Federalrequirement is an obstacle to the accomplishment of the HMTA and the HMR.(3) <T3>IR-22 allegedly misinterprets the nature of the obstacle test</T3>_(a)<T3>OHMT allegedly exceeds its authority to define the aim of Congress</T3>_(i)<T3>The City's Arguments. </T3>The City argues that ``OHMT wrongly broadenedthe `obstacle' test by saying that a local regulation is inconsistent ifit appears to obstruct the stated aims, not only of Congress in enactingthe law, but also of the administrative agency in interpreting its regulations.''City Memo. at 26. The City contends that OHMT has no authority to ``bootstrap''its limited authority to issue inconsistency rulings into an assertionthat it totally occupies certain subject areas within the broad field ofhazardous materials transportation. The City states that the legislativehistory of the HMTA suggests that Congress did not intend that ``cargocontainment systems, equipment and related requirements'' be preempted.The City argues that Congress adopted the Senate's provision of the Secretary'srulemaking authority, which the City asserts was ``softened'' from theHouse version. The House version had stated the Secretary ``shall'' regulatecertain topics, while the enacted provision states that the:<ITAG tagnum="20">regulations </ITAG><T3>may</T3> govern any safety aspect of the transportation of hazardousmaterials which the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate, including,but not limited to, the packing, repacking, handling, labeling, marketing,placarding, and routing * * * of hazardous materials. (Emphasis added)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">49 App. U.S.C. 1804(a).Thus, the City argues, Congress did not prescribe any particular topicsthat must be regulated by the Secretary, to the exclusion of state or localauthorities. The City notes that this list of topics does not include ``cargo/containment systems, equipment or related requirements.'' Furthermore,the City argues, ``it is only when the Secretary has actually promulgatedregulations with which a local regulation might conflict that preemptioncould occur.'' City Memo. at 27.The City contends that the tank truck regulations found in 49 CFR 178.340<T3>et seq</T3>. ``clearly state * * * that the standards they presentare `minimum requirements.' '' The City states that the Federal Motor CarrierSafety Regulations (FMCSR; 49 CFR Parts 390-397) contain explicit statementsthat they are not intended to preempt more stringent local regulations(andSection; 393.30) and that additional consistent equipment is permitted(andSection; 393.2). Therefore, the City argues, because the HMR at 49 CFR178.340-2(b) reference the ``parts and accessories'' regulations in theFMCSR, the FMCSR provisions on stringency and consistency must necessarilybe applicable to the HMR.The City takes issue with IR-22's reliance on prior inconsistency rulingsto establish exclusive Federal authority over ``cargo containment systems''because, according to the City:<ITAG tagnum="20">most of the DOT's prior inconsistency rulings have dealt with routingrestrictions, not truck design specifications [and] those few that diddiscuss any specification were dealing with the transportation of radioactivewaste, which is subject to an entirely different legislative history thanthat at issue here.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">City Memo. at 29.The City argues, for example, that IR-2, despite the use of the term ``cargocontainment systems'' in its preamble, did not deal with them, but insteaddealt with a permit system, hours of transit, an accessory lock, and other``regulatory features.'' The City contends that OHMT cannot rely on IR-7through IR-15 because the hazardous materials at issue in those rulingswere exclusively radioactive materials, which OHMT had addressed in a specialrulemaking in 1981. The City argues that DOT's exercise of rulemaking authorityin the area of radioactive materials does not mean that DOT has also occupiedthe field of ``packaging'' of other hazardous materials, and the City doesnot concede that ``packaging'' is synonymous with ``containment systems.''Finally, the City argues that DOT does not appear sure of its preemptionauthority over packaging and containers since in 1987 it submitted a legislativeproposal to Congress which would amend the HMTA to delineate specific subjectareas which are exclusively Federal, including ``the design, fabrication,marketing, maintenance, reconditioning, repairing, or testing of a packageor container.''(ii) <T3>Commenters' Arguments. </T3>ATA/NTTC argue that OHMT used its statutoryauthority properly to define the intent of the HMTA. The commenters statethat ``the Supreme Court has clearly affirmed the concept of a Federalagency defining the scope of the preemptive effect of its own regulationsthrough the exercise of its discretionary rulemaking authority.'' ATA/NTTCComments at 21.ATA/NTTC argue that the purpose of Congress in enacting the HMTA was tocreate national uniformity, which is why Congress consolidated rulemakingauthority in DOT. The commenters also argue that OHMT's preemption authority,whether exercised through inconsistency rulings, rulemaking, or other expressionof agency intent, has been fully recognized by the courts. ATA/NTTC specificallyreject the City's contention that OHMT's authority is limited to a specificsubject area. The commenters contend that OHMT's authority under the HMTAis the same for radioactive and non-radioactive hazardous materials, andcited both decisions in <T3>City of New York</T3> v.<T3>U.S. DOT,</T3> 539 F. Supp. 1237 (S.D.N.Y. 1982) <T3>rev'd other grounds,</T3> 715 F.2d 732 (2nd Cir.), <T3>cert. denied,</T3> 465 U.S. 1055 (1984), as affirming that authority.ATA/NTTC state that in both cases:<ITAG tagnum="20">the District Court and the Second Circuit * * * had the opportunityto specifically address the very argument raised here by the City. In thosecases, the City argued and the court rejected the proposition that OHMTcould determine a City regulation inconsistent and therefore, preemptedonly after making the specific factual evaluation called for under section1811(b) for a waiver of preemption. The City also argued and the DistrictCourt rejected the notion that DOT lacks the authority to preempt as inconsistentwith federal regulations, a non-uniform local regulation that is more stringentand better fosters the goal of local safety than the federal regulations.The District Court held that inconsistency with federal regulations couldbe based on non-uniformity in an area of regulation where OHMT has determinedthat uniformity is important to the objectives of the HMTA.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">ATA/NTTC Comments at 25-26.Finally, ATA/NTTC note that IR-22 is supported by the approach taken inthe most recent Supreme Court preemption case, <T3>California Coastal Commission </T3>v. <T3>Granite Rock Co.,</T3> 107 S. Ct. 1419 (1987), in which ``the Courtfocused exclusively on the obstacle test'' and ``looked at the Forest Service'sregulations to determine whether the agency intended to occupy the regulatoryfield and preempt state law.'' In conclusion, ATA/NTTC assert that ``theunderlying national objectives of the HMTA, the comprehensiveness of OHMT'sprior rulemaking and the prior inconsistency rulings * * * , PROVIDE AFIRM BASIS FOR OHMT in IR-22 to rely exclusively on the obstacle test.''(iii) <T3>Administrator's Decision.</T3> In enacting the HMTA, Congress vestedthe Secretary of Transportation with authority, delegated to RSPA, to regulatehazardous materials transportation. The legislative history indicates thatCongress sought to improve safety through nationally uniform standards,where appropriate, but left to the Secretary's discretion the scope andextent of regulation. The scope of topics which may be regulated is expressly<T3>not</T3> limited to those enumerated in the HMTA, nor is that enumerationof topics an expression of Congress' intent that Federal regulations onthose topics invariably are to preempt non-Federal requirements. RSPA hasexercised the discretion delegated to it by regulating numerous areas ofhazardous mataerials transportation to the degree it has determined necessary,and interpreted the law and its regulations to determine what role non-Federalentities may play in regulating each area. The City's contention that preemptioncan only occur when the Secretary has actually promulgated regulationswith which a local regulation would conflict is plainly in error. The Secretaryis responsible for implementing the HMTA and setting national standards.The absence of a regulation on a particular topic may indicate that non-Federalentities are free to regulate, but it may also mean that the Secretaryhas determined that no regulation is needed on that topic. Clearly, itis one of the purposes of the inconsistency ruling process to define thelimits of permissible non-Federal rulemaking.Furthermore, whether a non-Federal requirement is an obstacle to the accomplishmentof the HMTA is not dependent upon RSPA's intent to occupy a certain subjectarea. An agency's intent to occupy a given area is only one indicationof whether non-Federal entities may regulate in that area. Even in theabsence of any Federal intent to occupy a given area, a non-Federal requirementmay be found to be an obstacle if it interferes with accomplishing thestated purposes of the statute and implementing regulations.The City misconstrues the applicability of the FMCSR. IR-22 addressed thepreemptive effect of the FMCSR:<ITAG tagnum="21">For example, andSection; 178.340-2(b) incorporates by reference the49 CFR Part 393 requirements relating to parts and accessories applicableto all motor vehicles * * * and makes them applicable to * * * specificationcargo tanks used for hazardous materials transportation. The parts andaccessories requirements of 49 CFR Part 393, therefore, are HMR provisionsand thus are compared with state and local requirements for preemptionpurposes under both the `obstacle' and `dual compliance' tests.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">52 FR 46575.Thus, those FMCSR provisions which are incorporated by reference into theHMR (except for those incorporated by 49 CFR 177.804) are treated as HMRprovisions for the purposes of preemption.The City's argument disputing IR-22's reliance on prior inconsistency rulingsto establish exclusive Federal authority over cargo containment systemsis not persuasive. IR-22 quoted at length from IR-2 (44 FR 75566, December20, 1979) and subsequent IR's to demonstrate that as early as 1979, andconsistently since then, ``it has been clear that hazardous materials transportationcargo containment systems, packagings, accessories, construction tests,equipment and hazard warning systems are areas of exclusive Federal jurisdictionbecause of the total occupancy of those fields by the HMR.'' 52 FR 46580.The City's argument that RSPA's regulatory authority with respect to radioactivematerials is different from its authority with respect to other hazardousmaterials is specious. The HMTA does not differentiate the Secretary'sauthority on the basis of the hazardous materials to be regulated, butleaves those decisions to the Secretary's discretion. The Secretary haschosen to regulate the packaging of hazardous materials to such an extentthat the Federal role is exclusive. In contrast, the Secretary has promulgatedcomprehensive routing requirements only with respect to radioactive materials,and, therefore, has not determined, with respect to other hazardous materials,that the Federal role in routing is exclusive. The City simply ignoresa 10-year history of inconsistency rulings and expressions of RSPA intentwhich specifically contradict the City's position. The City's assertionwith respect to DOT's legislative proposal is without merit as discussedearlier.(b) <T3>OHMT allegedly wrongly defines the aim of Congress</T3>_(i) <T3>The City's Arguments</T3>. The City argues that OHMT wrongly definesthe intent of Congress as being uniformity of regulation, when in factthe actual aim of Congress is safety. The City states that Judge Sifton's1985 decision (<T3>supra</T3>) properly disposed of this issue, and that the ConferenceReport preemption language, rather than the Senate Report language morecommonly referred to, should be relied upon. The City notes that the ConferenceReport ``makes a point of coupling the exception provision to the preemptionprovision, showing that differing and more stringent local laws were notnecessarily to be preempted.'' City Memo. at 34. Moreover, the City notes,the Conference Report apparently did not approve that portion of the SenateReport which stated that varying as well as conflicting regulations wouldbe deemed inconsistent.(ii) <T3>Commenters' Arguments</T3>. ATA/NTTC assert that the purpose of theHMTA is to improve ``the regulatory and enforcement authority of the Secretaryof Transportation to protect the Nation adequately against the risks tolife and property which are inherent in the transportation of hazardousmaterials in commerce.'' ATA/NTTC Comments at 29 (quoting 49 App. U.S.C.1801). To achieve this purpose, ATA/NTTC state, the HMTA broadly delegatesto the Secretary rulemaking authority over ``<T3>any safety aspect</T3> of the transportation of hazardous materialswhich the <T3>Secretary deems </T3>necessary or appropriate.'' ATA/NTTC Commentsat 29 (emphasis added), quoting 49 App. U.S.C. 1804. Commenters assertthat in support of this authority, Congress provided explicitly that non-Federalregulations determined to be inconsistent with Federal regulations arepreempted. Commenters further note that the First Circuit, in <T3>National Tank Truck Carriers Association</T3> v. <T3>Burke</T3>, 608 F.2d 819, 824 (1979) stated that the purpose of theHMTA ``was to secure a general pattern of uniform, national regulations,and thus `to preclude a multiplicity of State and local regulations andthe potential for varying as well as conflicting regulations in the areaof hazardous materials transportation'. Senate Committee on Commerce, ReportNo. 93-1192, September 30, 1974.''(iii) <T3>Administrator's Decision</T3>. RSPA does not disagree that the goalof the HMTA is to improve hazardous materials transportation safety, butCongress intended that the means of achieving that goal include nationalstandards to be promulgated by DOT in order to reduce the need for Stateand local regulation. The inconsistency ruling process is intended to determinewhich state or local requirements are inconsistent with the nationwideFederal standards and, therefore, preempted, as Congress directed in Section1811(a).(c) <T3>OHMT allegedly fails to balance the degree of alleged impediment tothe national aim against legitimate local safety needs</T3>_(i) <T3>The City's Arguments</T3>. The City asserts that where there is no<T3>per se</T3> preemption, it is necessary to use a balancing test todetermine inconsistency by weighing ``the City's legitimate safety concernsagainst whatever degree of uniformity is necessary to achieve the overallCongressional aim of safety.'' City Memo. at 36.(ii) <T3>Commenters' Arguments</T3>. ATA/NTTC state that the City is wrong inasserting that inconsistency determinations should be based on whetherthe non-Federal regulation is an obstacle to local safety, and adds that``OHMT may consider local safety factors in a separate administrative proceedingunder section 1811(b) as a basis to waive preemption.'' ATA/NTTC Commentsat 32. ATA/NTTC argue that once a state or local regulation has been determinedto be inconsistent and therefore preempted, the HMTA authorizes the Secretaryin a subsequent proceeding to determine whether the state or local regulationnevertheless qualifies for an exemption from preemption.(iii) <T3>Rebuttal Comments</T3>. The City argues that OHMT erred in not consideringthe City's safety evidence in an area where Congress has not dictated uniformityand the regulations state that the standards are minimums. The City arguesthat a safety analysis would obviate the need for an additional administrativeproceeding, and that ``the waiver proceeding is available to insure thatsafety is considered even in those cases (such as radioactive transportationrouting) where it is clear that Congress intended uniformity as its firstline of defense. The existence of two separate proceedings is to covertwo separate situations, not to be stages of a single proceeding.'' CityReply Memo. at 10.(iv) <T3>Administrator's Decision</T3>. There is no suggestion in the plainlanguage of the HMTA or the inconsistency regulations that the inconsistencyruling process and the waiver of preemption process are intended to applyto two different situations, nor have they been so applied. Considerationof local safety concerns is properly conducted during a waiver of preemptionproceeding. As commenters point out, the correct analysis in an inconsistencyruling proceeding is whether a state or local requirement stands as anobstacle to compliance with the Federal regulations, not whether localsafety concerns justify a waiver of preemption. Virtually all state andlocal hazardous materials requirements are prompted by safety concerns,but the focus of preemption analysis is whether state or local requirementsare inconsistent with national objectives, not whether local safety concernsshould be weighed against national concerns.3. <T3>OHMT allegedly erred in its application of the law to the facts whenit held that the city's regulations are inconsistent with the HMTA andHMR</T3>.<ITAG tagnum="81">a. The City's Regulations Allegedly Are Not An Obstacle To the CongressionalAim of Safety.</ITAG>(1) <T3>The City's regulations allegedly cause no significant delays</T3>_(a)<T3>The City's Arguments</T3>_<T3>Applicants allegedly overstate the amount of downloading caused bythe City regulations</T3>. The City contends that its regulations do notcause significant delays and that the applicants' assertions to the contrary,which IR-22 accepted, can be rebutted. The City asserts that the applicantshave overstated the amount of ``downloading'' (i.e., transfer of hazardousmaterials cargo from a DOT-specification vehicle into a City-specificationvehicle) caused by the City's regulations because those regulations applyonly to trucks stopping to make local pickups or deliveries. Secondly,the City asserts that the bulk of flammable and combustible liquids transportedfor local delivery within the City consists of gasoline and fuel oil, whichare transported by the industry in an ``entire fleet of City-specificationtrucks'' without the need for downloading. Third, the City argues thatthe applicants have not shown that there is any significant volume of hazardousmaterials remaining to be downloaded. The City argues that the common practiceis for a distant manufacturer to ship to a metropolitan-area storage facilityand either have a local trucker deliver from there or have a local customerpurchase from the storage depot. Neither of these alternatives involvesdownloading which would delay shipments in transit, the City contends.The City further contends that there is no ``significant increase in riskfrom the fact that a particular customer's order may be handled twice ifit is delivered to a local storage terminal and then reshipped to the customer''because such a practice ``is a routine procedure already being done safelyevery day.'' City Memo. at 40.<T3>The City's permit system allegedly does not cause hazardous delaysin shipment</T3>. The City also contends that its permit system does notcause delays because, unlike the permit system in IR-2 and the related<T3>Burke</T3> case, the City's system does not require loaded DOT-specificationvehicles to stop at the border to get a permit, thus interrupting and delayinga particular shipment. The City argues that under its system, carriersobtain permits before a truck is loaded for shipment, either by hiringa City-specification truck which already has a permit, or by includingsome City-specification trucks in their fleets and obtaining the necessaryannual permits well in advance of actual shipments.(b) <T3>Commenters' Arguments</T3>_<T3>Downloading allegedly causes delay.</T3> ATA/NTTC argue that the City'sattempt to minimize the application of its regulations is disingenuous.ATA/NTTC state that the City's argument ``implies that industry operatestwo distinct and separate classifications of vehicles, one for making pickupsor deliveries in the City and another for making pickup[s] or deliveriesoutside the City.'' ATA/NTTC Comments at 36. ATA/NTTC note that a vehiclebeing used in interstate commerce may be required to make pickups or deliveriesat many locations both within and outside New York City. Futhermore, theynote that there are truck terminals in the City where cargo is transferredbetween trucks in interstate commerce so that even though there is no localpickup or delivery, the City's regulations would apply. ATA/NTTC statethat the City's regulations would also prohibit vehicles carrying hazardousmaterials from making a rest stop, or a stop for food or fuel, or frommaking pickups or deliveries of non-hazardous materials.The City regulations also apply, ATA/NTTC argue, to more than just bulkshipments of gasoline and fuel oil, so that the potential for downloadingexists for packaged freight as well. ATA/NTTC ``completely reject the City'sassertion that the bulk transportation of non-gasoline non-fuel oil hazardouschemicals is so minimal that the safety concerns of downloading can beignored.'' ATA/NTTC Comments at 37. ATA/NTTC also take issue with the City'scontention that metropolitan-area storage depots reduce the need for downloading.They contend that many of the metropolitan depots are actually locatedin New Jersey, so that shipments from them to the City involve interstateshipments, which DOT, not the City, has been given responsibility to regulate.ATA/NTTC assert that the City's argument concerning the use of local storagedepots clearly shows that the regulations cause delay. Because a single(DOT-specification) vehicle cannot be used to ship directly to a purchaserin the City, they contend, shipments must be downloaded, creating delaysand an increase in risk. In addition, ATA/NTTC state that the City's arbitrarytank truck volume limitations means an increase in the number of tripsnecessary, creating additional delay and risk.<T3>Permits allegedly cause delay</T3>. ATA/NTTC argue that whether hazardousmaterials are downloaded directly to City-specification vehicles or toa storage depot, significant delays can be caused waiting for a City truckor storage facility to become available. They assert that the ``City cannotpossibly justify its regulations by arguing that such a delay, involvinga vehicle parked on the side of the road outside the City, trying to findan adequate local carrier or adequate storage depot, does not representthe kind of delay the HMTA was designed to prevent.'' ATA/NTTC Commentsat 40. Furthermore, they assert, industry does not maintain different fleetsof trucks to serve different cities. If hazardous materials had to be transferredto local vehicles permitted in each city, ATA/NTTC contend, obvious delaysin transit would result that are clearly the type of delay the HMTA wasdesigned to prevent.(c) <T3>Rebuttal Comments.</T3> The City contends that commenters have notsubmitted any evidentiary material to quantify their claims. Furthermore,the City contends that the great bulk of hazardous materials being transportedis short-haul and uses the existing fleet of City-specification trucks.The City admits that in some instances it will be necessary for shippersto use different vehicles to serve New York customers than they use forcustomers in other cities, but maintains that the City is sufficientlyunique in comparison to all other cities that the rationale behind itsregulations could scarcely become a precedent for any other place. CityReply Memo. at 16.  (d) <T3>Administrator's Decision.</T3> The Director of OHMT found that an additionalreason for the inconsistency of the City directives is ``their propensityto cause significant delays of hazardous materials transportation.'' 52FR 46583. As the Director stated, previous inconsistency rulings have foundthat delay of such transportation is incompatible with safe transportation.The City and commenters agree that some downloading will occur but disagreeabout the extent of such downloading. Clearly, there are delays involvedin downloading, and the mere threat of delay has been sufficient for afinding of inconsistency in prior inconsistency rulings, as the Directordiscussed at length in IR-22. In this case, actual delays in transit areinvolved in downloading, which exposes neighboring jurisdictions to anincreased risk of accidents and spills. The City contends that its regulationsdo not cause significant delay, but the issue under 49 CFR 177.853 is whetherthe delay is ``unnecessary''. Downloading hazardous materials from DOT-specificationtrucks, which are presumptively safe, into City-specification trucks isunnecessary and causes unnecessary delay in transportation. Similarly,the City's permit requirements cause unnecessary delay, because a carrierusing DOT-specification trucks, which are presumptively safe, must obtainCity permits at some point prior to transporting hazardous materials toor from the City. The City's burdensome permit application requirements,its unfettered discretion in granting permits, and the time needed to processapplications create delays in the transportation of hazardous materials.Although a permit system is not <T3>per se</T3> inconsistent, the delays caused by the City's permit systemare unnecessary because the City's permit requirements are inconsistentwith the HMTA. The City's argument that a particular shipment need notbe delayed, because a carrier can obtain permits well in advance of actualshipments, is specious. The only way a carrier can avoid delays is by complyingwith the City requirement to use City-specificatioin trucks, which theDirector of OHMT determined is an obstacle to compliance with the HMTAand the HMR. The Director has sufficient reason to find that the delaysthat are and would be caused by the BFP Directives constitute an independentbasis for inconsistency with the HMR, and I affirm that finding.  (2) <T3>The City's regulations allegedly do not deter compliance with the HMR._</T3>(a)<T3>The City's Arguments.</T3> The City argues that the fact that a fleetof trucks exists that meets the City's more stringent requirements doesnot deter compliance because manufacturers and carriers build and operatedual complying trucks. Even those City-specification trucks that do notmeet all HMR requirements, the City argues, are in compliance as long asthey operate only within New York State, because the HMTA and HMR applyonly to interstate operations. The City states that the HMTA adopted theHouse version of ``commerce'' which ``explicitly states that the regulations`did not extend to any such transportation which is solely between pointsin the same State.' '' City Memo. at 42, quoting Conf. Rept. No. 93-1347,reprinted in U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News at 7688. TheCity also asserts that DOT has acknowleged that its regulations do notapply to intrastate commerce, because it has proposed to expand applicationof the HMR (52 FR 24195, June 29, 1987). The City contends that the mereexistence of two sets of truck specifications will not lead to non-compliancewith the HMR, because manufacturers and carriers are perfectly capableof ordering and using ``dually-compliant'' vehicles. In fact, the Citynotes, many carriers regularly customize their orders to meet particularlocal regulatory needs.  (b) <T3>Commenters' Arguments.</T3> ATA/NTTC contend that the City's only responseto the potential for confusion and sole reliance on City regulations isto assert that manufacturers and carriers are perfectly capable of orderingand using ``dually-compliant'' vehicles. ATA/NTTC argue that this ``inadequateresponse does not change the fact that manufacturers and carriers do nothave the extensive resources that would be necessary to conduct the dualtechnical and regulatory analysis necessary to design, manufacture andmaintain a vehicle that fully complies with all HMR requirements, yet canalso be permitted by the City Fire Department.'' ATA/NTTC Comments at 42. ATA/NTTC assert that the City incorrectly argues that the HMTA only appliesto interstate commerce, when in fact the definition of commerce in theHMTA specifically includes transportation which ``affects'' interstatecommerce. Thus, they argue, the HMTA clearly ``allows coverage of intrastatecommerce or RSPA would not have the legal authority to consider applyingits regulations to all forms of intrastate commerce.'' ATA/NTTC also notethat the HMR apply to intrastate movements by interstate carriers and tothe intrastate portion of interstate transportation.ATA/NTTC dismiss the City's argument about customization by noting thatthe City's regulations go beyond mere customization. As an example, ATA/NTTCstate that the City regulations flatly prohibit the use of tractor trailersto deliver flammables, yet a tractor-trailer cannot be converted into astraight truck by customization. Finally, ATA/NTTC note that differenceshave been the basis for preemption in the past, as in the <T3>Ritter </T3>case, where the court held that ``compressed gas containertesting requirements were preempted because they differed from federalrequirements and therefore stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment ofthe purpose and objective of Congress.'' ATA/NTTC Comments at 43. (c) <T3>Administrator's Decision. </T3>The City is incorrect in asserting thatthe HMTA applies only to interstate transportation. Section 103 of theHMTA defines ``commerce'' as trade, traffic, commerce, or transportationbetween a place in a State and a place outside such State, or which <T3>affects </T3>such trade, traffic, commerce, or transportation. DOThas chosen to exercise this authority by regulating all transportationby interstate motor carriers, which includes the intrastate portion ofany interstate transportation. 49 CFR 171.1. With respect to use of dually-compliantvehicles, RSPA assumes for purposes of this discussion that such vehiclescan be built. However, dual compliance is not the issue. The issue is thatRSPA has already determined what specifications are necessary for truckshauling hazardous materials. To the extent the City believes the HMR areinadequate, the City may file a petition for rulemaking under 49 CFR 106.31.Therefore, I affirm the Director's determination that the BFP Directivesdeter compliance with HMR. (3) <T3>The City's regulations allegedly promote safety in a densely populatedarea_ </T3>(a) <T3>The City's Arguments. </T3>The City states that OHMT dismissed itsargument that New York's population density justifies more stringent regulationsby saying that almost any urban area has a population density which isa matter of concern in hazardous materials transportation. The City notesthat OHMT's own regulations at 49 CFR 397.9(a) dictate that hazardous materialsshipments should avoid densely populated areas, tunnels, and narrow streetsor alleys. The City states that its road system and lack of a beltway makeit inevitable that hazardous materials shipments travel through neighborhoodswhere between 10,000 and 50,000 people reside within a half-mile wide bandof the highway, in contrast to neighboring counties where the greatestnumber of persons within a half-mile of the truck route is 10,000. TheCity asserts that an extra measure of safety in the City ``is necessaryand appropriate, under the aim of Congress to create a uniform level ofsafety throughout the nation.'' City Memo. at 45. The City contends that OHMT recognized the City's unique situation in IR-2(44 FR 75569, December 20, 1979), when it ``barred certain Rhode Islandregulations partly on the ground that its population density did not warrantthe kind of special regulation that might be appropriate to a place asdensely populated as New York City.'' City Memo. at 46. The City also contendsthat its aging and often substandard roads, its combination of subways,bridges, elevated and depressed roadways, traffic congestion, and populationdensity makes fires more difficult to fight and the consequences of anaccident potentially more severe than in other localities. All of thesefactors, the City contends, must be weighed against OHMT's claim that cargocontainment systems and equipment require national uniformity. (b) <T3>Commenters' Arguments. </T3>ATA/NTTC assert that the alleged safetybenefits of the City's regulations are relevant only in a subsequent waiverof preemption determination. First, ATA/NTTC argue that ``under the HMTA,OHMT, not the New York City Fire Department, has the responsibility fordeveloping regulations to protect the nation, including New York City andits neighbors, adequately against the risks posed by the transportationof hazardous materials.'' ATA/NTTC Comments at 44-45. Second, they arguethat ``the HMTA sets up a separate waiver of preemption process in section1811(b) which gives OHMT * * * authority to determine whether the City'sallegedly ``unique'' circumstances allow for a different regulatory approach.''ATA/NTTC Comments at 45. ATA/NTTC contend that the city's argument has been rejected by the courts(<T3>City of New York </T3>v. <T3>U.S. Department of Transportation, </T3>539 F. Supp. 1237 at 1254,715 F.2d 732) and is contrary to the plain wording of the statute. ATA/NTTCpoint out that the Second Circuit, in <T3>NYC </T3>v. <T3>DOT, supra,</T3><ITAG tagnum="20">concluded that OHMT's authority and responsibility to waive preemptionunder Section 1811(b) was meant to ``ameliorate the sweep of section 112(a)[1811(a)] * * * so that </ITAG><T3>`in certain exceptional circumstances' </T3>DOT could limit the preemptiveforce of federal regulations `to secure more stringent regulations' bylocal authorities. <T3>Senate Report, supra, </T3>at 38.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">ATA/NTTC Comments at 46. Therefore, ATA/NTTC argue that the waiver of preemption procedures thatOHMT has adopted are the proper forum in which to address the city's factualsafety arguments. (c) <T3>Administrator's Decision. </T3>As previously discussed, considerationof the City's safety concerns would be appropriate in a subsequent waiverof preemption proceeding but is not relevant in this proceeding.   (4) <T3>Other Issues and Comments_Driver Certification Requirements. </T3>TheCity states that RSPA reserved ruling on the driver certification requirementsin one of the City's regulations (BFP Directive 7-74, subsections 2-2 and2-3), but failed to defer ruling on similar requirements in other Cityregulations (BFP Directive 5-63, section 2, BFP Directive 6-76, section2, and all of BFP Directive 7-74 section 2). The Director of OHMT foundthat each of the above sections (entitled ``Certificate of Fitness'') areinextricably tied to the City's inconsistent permitting requirement andthus are themselves inconsistent, with the exception of subsections 2-2and 2-3 concerning certificate of fitness requirements. Therefore, thedirector properly did not defer ruling on those requirements. OHMT hasnow issued IR-26, 54 FR 16314 (April 21, 1989), concerning the CaliforniaDepartment of Motor Vehicles' regulations on training required for highwaytransportation of hazardous materials. OHMT will publish a notice seekingadditional comment on the city's certificate of fitness requirements inlight of IR-26. <T3>Other Comments. </T3>The New Jersey Turnpike Authority (NJTA) commentedthat it supported the decision in IR-22 and wished to advise that its positionas expressed during the comment period on IRA-40 remains the same. The Liquid and Bulk Tank Division of Fruehauf Corporation commented thatit agreed with DOT's finding in IR-22 that the City's special requirementsfor tanks are at odds with DOT's requirements and may not be as good. The Truck Renting and Leasing Association and the National Private TruckingAssociation both commented that they agree with OHMT's interpretation ofthe HMTA and urge RSPA to deny the City's appeal of IR-22. ``Bomar'' Tank Discharge Systems, Inc. a manufacturer of City-approvedtruck tanks, submitted rebuttal comments stating that preemption of theCity's tank truck directive would increase the risk of transporting gasolineand other hazardous liquids in the City. ``Bomar'' contends that tank trucksmanufactured to City specifications are safer than DOT-specification trucks,and cites engineering analysis, accident statistics, and common sense tosupport its contention. D.R. Pesuit andamp; Associates (DRP), consultants on gasoline tank trucks,submitted an analysis comparing DOT tanks with City-approved tanks whichit had prepared at the request of ``Bomar.'' DRP concludes that City-approvedgasoline tank trucks are safer than DOT-specification trucks, and that,therefore, DOT should not preempt the City regulations. <T3>Administrator's Response. </T3>I have considered all the comments andrebuttal comments submitted to the docket and, for the reasons discussedabove, have determined that the decision in IR-22 should be affirmed. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
