Now Santa Clara County's largest bank and its talented -- andsome say imperious -- chairman, Phillip Boyce, face their biggest challenge inyears.;    In March, a loan officer pleaded guilty to embezzling more than$1.8 million. In April, a check-kiting scheme was discovered that couldtranslate into an after-tax operating loss of $1.2 million. And in the spaceof six months, the bank lost two important executives to resignation or firing.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business Monday  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PAC WESTERN FACES STERNEST TESTHURT BY SCHEMES AND RECESSION, BANK FIGHTSTO STAY HEALTHY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  BankingChart attached at end of article  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;Who are they?&quot; Boyce asked. &quot; 'Important' executives? I guess that's yourword.&quot;;    It's an icy response to the December resignation of his longtimechief financial officer and the May firing of his president, Boyce's No. 2executive and former San Jose State University roommate. But the responseunderlines Boyce's single-minded determination to get his high-performing bankback on track.;    Besides the string of embarrassing headlines, the bank --arguably one of the state's healthiest -- has been hobbled by the recession.The gap is shrinking between what the bank pays depositors and chargesborrowers, bad loans are mushrooming, it has restricted one of its mostlucrative -- but risky -- lines of lending, and profits and profitability havefallen for two consecutive quarters.;    And there's no telling when the hightimes will return.;    Compared with the likes of Wells Fargo, SecurityPacific and First Interstate Bank -- three California giants that last weekreported setting aside huge loan reserves, slumping profits or outright losses-- the financial problems at $1.2 billion Pacific Western seem insignificant.And many of the nation's bankers no doubt would love to swap places withBoyce.;    But the problems nonetheless are a blemish for the bank, and theyprovide further evidence that the recession has crossed the California borderand settled in Silicon Valley. More tangibly, Pacific Western's reaction toproblems already is trickling down to local depositors, small businesses andreal estate borrowers hoping to earn higher rates on their savings or line uploans during a nationwide credit crunch.;    This isn't the first time such achallenge has faced Boyce, who founded Pacific Valley Bank in 1975 at the ageof 31. In the mid-1980s, Pacific Valley stumbled under the weight of bad loansand leases to oil and coal-mining ventures, and the bank wrote off $2 millionin loans to Technical Equities Corp., a San Jose investment firm that crashedin 1986. But the bank moved on, its profitability improved, and its assetsgrew to nearly $500 million.;    In 1987, Boyce orchestrated Pacific Valley'smerger with like-sized County Bank andamp; Trust Co. The marriage was lauded at thetime, but it wasn't without pain, and the combined banks recorded only a$29,000 profit that year. After that, however, Boyce steered ahead quickly andsteadily through 1990, grabbing a 7 percent share of the bank deposits inSanta Clara, Santa Cruz and Monterey counties and ringing up $16.8 million inprofits.;    Like most banks, Pacific Western cashed in on the real estatedevelopment boom in the late 1980s. Real estate construction loans -- whichgenerate high fees and turn over quickly -- became the bank's fastest-growingloan segment, jumping from 14 percent of the loan portfolio in 1987 to 24percent last year. Commercial loans continue to account for about one-third ofthe bank's loans.;    But the success of real estate loans reflect the overallreal estate market, and the California market is flat now, forcing homebuilders to trim prices and developers to cut rents to fill vacant shoppingcenters. As a result, more and more real estate loans are going sourstatewide.;    The flat real estate market can't be blamed for all of PacificWestern's problems, of course, but it has magnified them. Bad real estateloans in 1990 accounted for 61 percent of the bank's non-performing loans,which jumped 71 percent to $17.6 million. At the same time, the bankforeclosed on properties with an estimated net value of $13.3 million -- upfrom $57,000 in 1989 -- and net credit losses more than doubled to $3million.;    And the picture has worsened in the first quarter of this year.The bank has made fewer loans than before, sour loans have climbed, and thenet estimated value of foreclosed property has jumped to $19.4 million.Similar news is expected when the bank announces its results for the secondquarter ended June 30.;    &quot;This is higher than we'd like to have&quot; inforeclosed property, Boyce said, explaining that he'd be comfortable with a$10 million to $12 million figure. &quot;But we think that has pretty much peakedat this stage. That will depend on how the economy fares over the summer.&quot;;   Only time will tell for the economy, but Pacific Western is moving ahead.Boyce likens his bank to a &quot;17-burner stove&quot; manned by a cook who isconstantly adjusting the flames depending on what's hot in the economy.;   Perhaps most important, the bank has turned off the gas on construction loansand put more heat on commercial lending. Former bank employees say regulatorshad pressured the bank -- as it has Wells Fargo and scores of other banks --to cap the share of the loan portfolio allotted to construction loans.;   Boyce denies regulators singled out his bank, however. Regulators &quot;want a morebalanced position for everybody,&quot; he said, adding later that the strategy wastriggered by &quot;the overabundance of construction lending in the marketplace.&quot;;   In recent months, the bank also has stopped buying car loans issued bydealers and sold its mortgage loan servicing rights and its data-processingsubsidiary. And though the firing of President James R. Kenny was messy andstirred up unfavorable industry gossip, the move did eliminate a boss whoraked in nearly $600,000 in salary and bonuses last year.;    &quot;We're nodifferent from anyone else. We react to the marketplace,&quot; Boyce said.&quot;Remember, we are a direct mirror of the economy.&quot;;    As such, Boyce saysPacific Western's earnings will reflect the nation's ability to pull out of arecession. Though bank profits will be down &quot;substantially&quot; for the firsthalf, he predicts they will rebound to &quot;respectable&quot; levels in the secondhalf.;    And despite the trials of the past nine months, Boyce remainsupbeat.;    &quot;I think change in an institution is always a little chaotic, butit's not chaos (here) by any stretch of the imagination. . . .&quot; he said.&quot;Change in general is good for institutions. We feel stronger for the changeswe've made.&quot;; HOW PACIFIC WESTERN COMPARES; Pacific Western Bank of San Jose;matches up favorably with 12 other; California-based banks with $1 billion; to$5 billion in assets at the close of 1990.; INSTITUTION:;                                                Net;             Return    Return      Core cap(3)/ charge-offs(d);   Assets    on avg.   on avg.     adj. total    /loan-loss;  (in bil)  assets(1) equity(2)   assets        reserve(5); City National   Beverly Hills $4.96  0.90  14.68  6.79  0.65; ...; Sumitomo         SanFrancisco  4.80  0.98  18.12  5.54  0.31; Imperial         Inglewood      3.03 0.95  15.92  6.01  0.43; Bk of the West   San Francisco  2.67  0.46   7.75 4.89  0.82; San Diego Trust  San Diego      1.62  0.79  12.22  6.46  0.26;Farmers andamp; Merch.
