But department economists say consumer demand and prices areharder to predict because so much depends on weather, the nation'sgeneral economy, overseas markets and other variables.   Ralph Parlett of the department's Economic Research Service saysretail food prices in general are expected to rise an average of 5percent to 7 percent this year from 1988 _ when the increase was 4.1percent.   ``Prices for red meats, poultry, eggs, fresh vegetables andprocessed vegetables rose sharply during the first half of theyear,'' he said. ``Although most of these will decline in the secondhalf, overall food prices will be about steady.''   Historically, this year's increase is the sharpest since 1981when food prices climbed 7.8 percent.   According to the current forecast for 1989, retail beef and vealprices _ which, with pork, are measured on an all-cut basis _ aregoing up an average of 4 percent to 6 percent, compared with a 5.5percent increase in 1988.   Pork prices may hold steady or even decline by as much as 2percent from last year. And pork prices, reflecting a downwardcrunch on hog farmers, dropped 3 percent in 1988, ending severalyears of rising prices.   Behind the scenes, far from the supermarket counters shopped byconsumers, some important developments are taking place.   ``Cattle inventories at the beginning of July indicated probableherd expansion,'' says the September issue of Agricultural Outlookmagazine. ``The number of beef cows that have calved was unchanged,while replacement beef heifers increased 4 percent from a yearearlier.''   But that involves long-term expansion, simply because of thebiological clock. It takes nine months for a newly bred heifer todeliver a calf, and another 15 to 20 months before the calf is grownup for slaughter and turned into supermarket beef.   July surveys indicated that on-farm supplies of feeder cattle _younger steers and heifers that could be sent to feedlots forfurther growth _ were up 1 percent from a year earlier.   Improved forage conditions have helped producers hold back onsending feeder cattle to feedlots this summer, allowing more animalsto be kept in pastures instead.   ``The high prices currently necessary to bid feeder cattle awayfrom pasture may be too great to ensure profitability in thefeedlots without much lower grain prices,'' the report said.   According to USDA estimates feed grain production will reboundsharply from last year's yield-shriveling drought, led by a 49percent jump in corn output to around 7.35 billion bushels as ofAug. 1 indications.   Corn market prices are projected to drop to an average of $1.85to $2.30 per bushel in the marketing year that will begin Sept. 1,from $2.50 to $2.60 estimated for 1988-89.   Extensive price specials in June and July, especially forlower-valued cuts, pushed retail beef prices down after rising forsix months, the report said. But with lower beef output this fall,prices are expected to rise again in the fourth quarter, a period ofseasonally greater demand.   Looking at the hog situation, the report said producers are infor lower market prices as slaughter picks up seasonally inSeptember.   ``Weekly kills could approach 1.9 million head by November,compared with a midsummer rate of about 1.5 million,'' the reportsaid. ``This will put downward pressure on fresh pork prices,prompting packers to bid less for hogs.''   Market hogs that sold in the high $40s per 100 pounds atmidsummer could decline $10 before bottoming out this fall, thereport said. Prices in the fourth quarter could average in the high$30s per hundredweight, close to year-earlier levels.   ``Although feed costs are expected to decline this fall, returnsto hog producers likely will remain below break-even,'' the reportsaid. ``The extended period of poor returns could cause producers toreduce breedings below previous intentions.''   Cutbacks in breeding farrowings this fall would reduce porkproduction after the first quarter of 1990.   Meanwhile, broiler producers have stepped up production, whichled to a summer decline in wholesale prices. Analysts said thoseprices are likely to keep declining this fall as more broilers go tomarket. Total output is expected to be up 6 percent to 7 percentfrom 1988.   Turkey production is expected to rise 4 percent to 5 percent thisyear. Wholesale prices of hen turkeys in the Eastern marketsaveraged 65 cents per pound in July, down five cents from a yearearlier.   However, prices are expected to strengthen as retailers buyadditional turkeys for holiday consumption.   Poultry prices at the consumer level, overall, are expected torise an average of 6 percent to 8 percent in 1989, compared with a7.2 percent gain in 1988. Those include prices of all birds sold atretail.   Egg production is expected to drop only 2 percent this yearinstead of the 3 percent decline estimated earlier, the report said.Profits have improved and have spurred some rebuilding of flocks.   The New York wholesale price for Grade A large eggs rose fromabout 76 cents per dozen in July to around 85 cents by August,compared with the high 60s a year earlier, the report said. Pricesare expected be in the range of 80 to 82 cents in the third quarterand then decline to 68 to 72 cents in the fourth.   Over the entire year, USDA economists predicted that retail eggprices will average 15 percent to 20 percent more than in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
