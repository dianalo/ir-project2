Issues that civil rights advocates group under the heading ofeconomic justice, often dealing with labor and welfare, areprominent on the list.   Civil rights for the disabled, legal services for the poor andmandatory leave from work for parents of newborns and sick childrenare all priorities for the Leadership Conference, an umbrella groupthat takes in virtually the entire civil rights community.   The new emphasis represents not so much a change in direction asa return to issues that were largely ignored while civil rightsforces skirmished with the Reagan administration throughout much ofthe 1980s.   Not all of the new priorities are economic. For example, civilrights advocates continue to press for easier voter registration andthey are preparing to fight English-only legislation that would barbilingual education programs for Hispanics.   ``It is an aggressive and ambitious agenda,'' says Ralph Neas,executive director of the Leadership Conference. ``But we areconfident that the 101st Congress will pass it. We hope that theBush administration will play a constructive role.''   As usual, civil rights advocates are watching carefully to see ifPresident Bush will name federal judges inclined toward moderatepositions or hard-line conservatives who might challenge the legalchanges of the past three decades.   Judicial nominations are always a chief concern of civil rightsgroups. They count the defeat of outspoken conservative Robert Borkfor the Supreme Court as one of their most important victories ofthe Reagan era.   But the showdown over Bork represented only one in a series ofCapitol Hill victories for civil rights forces over the last eightyears.   ``The Congress prevented the right wing from passing any majoritems on its legislative agenda and, furthermore, the Congressduring the Reagan years passed many important civil rightsinitiatives,'' says Neas.   The conference points with pride to the success of last year'sbill to toughen fair housing enforcement, recent victories on SouthAfrica sanctions legislation and the Martin Luther King holiday,plus the congressional override of President Reagan's veto of theCivil Rights Restoration Act.   That legislation came in response to the Supreme Court's GroveCity decision, in which the justices held that the government couldnot deny federal aid to one program merely because of discriminationin an unrelated program operated by the same institution.   In fact, Congress has passed so many measures urged by civilrights advocates that they now say some of the most pressing needslie outside the legislative arena. That is especially so with thedeparture of Edwin Meese III as attorney general and WilliamBradford Reynolds, the longtime head of the civil rights division inthe Reagan Justice Department.   A recent report from the Citizens Commission on Civil Rights, a17-member panel of former federal officials, was sharply critical ofthe department's enforcement record in the Reagan era.   It said, for example, that the Reagan Justice Department filedabout 10 housing bias cases annually, half the number under theNixon and Carter administrations.   ``I think the question of enforcement of civil rights laws willbe stronger, because I think that with Reagan gone, there will be nogreat voice of weakening,'' says Benjamin Hooks, executive directorof the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peopleand chairman of the Leadership Conference.   There may be some reluctance to move forward with civil rightslegislation until President Bush indicates what he might accept.   ``I think that's just a sensible thing to do,'' says Rep. DonEdwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's civilrights and civil liberties subcommittee.   Meanwhile, he envisions hearings in the year ahead to determinejust how well the existing civil rights laws are being enforced.Additional sessions of his panel will take up the long-festeringquestion of whether college entrance examinations are skewed towardwhites and thus place minority students at an unfair disadvantage.   The Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which wouldban discrimination on the basis of gender, remains a cause dear towomen's groups and many civil rights advocates. Edwards says,however, that the measure will not be brought to the floor unlessthere is enough support to pass it.</TEXT></DOC>
