The study has been continuedsince 1981. In FY 1986, the component materials and manufacturing processeswere successively studied and improved. A large, microporous, tough electrodeplate was manufactured by the improved manufacturing process of doctor-bladeand paper machine. Corrosion-resistant Al-and Y-added Cr-Ni steel wasdeveloped for the material of separator. The structure of separator ofcell and the advantages of the cascade gas-cooling system of it was confirmed.In the experiment of a 10 layer-laminated cell with the electrode areaof 3600 cm{sup 2} each, the output was 4.2 kW. A cell with thee blocksof the laminated cell successfully generated the output of 12.4 kW. (10figs, 2 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
