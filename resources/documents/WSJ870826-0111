Cyril Ramaphosa, leader of the National Union of Mineworkers, said the union would poll its members today and respond to the mineowners by tonight. The strike will continue unless the offer is accepted, he said.    The union won't recommend acceptance or rejection of the offer, but Mr. Ramaphosa said: &quot;The union negotiating team is clearly not happy that the issue of wages was not discussed.&quot;    The wage issue has been the focus of the strike, with the NUM demanding a 30% across-the-board pay increase. The mine owners unilaterally implemented wage increases ranging up to 23% in July.    Officials of the Chamber of Mines, which represents the country's six largest mining houses, and the NUM met yesterday for the first time since the walkout began Aug. 9.    After almost four hours of talks, Johann Liebenberg, leader of the employers' negotiating team, said, &quot;We weren't prepared to increase wages but we were prepared to increase fringe benefits.&quot;    &quot;The union was advised that if the offers were rejected they would be withdrawn,&quot; he added.    &quot;We haven't given them everything they asked for, but that is the bargaining process,&quot; Mr. Liebenberg said. He described the talks as &quot;fruitful and cordial.&quot;    Mr. Ramaphosa said, &quot;We think progress has been made,&quot; but he added that &quot;the strike is continuing. It has not been stopped.&quot; He said the talks had produced neither a settlement nor a deadlock.    The negotiations resumed after Anglo American Corp. said on Monday that it was willing to hold talks without preconditions, apparently dropping the mine owners' previous insistence that wages weren't open to discussion. The union responded by saying that Anglo American's &quot;revised position . . . has created a climate to set negotiations in motion.&quot;    Riot police kept a close watch on several hundred demonstrators outside the Chamber of Mines headquarters, where the talks took place, but no clashes were reported.    The only other negotiations that have taken place during the strike involved only Anglo American and the union, not the other members of the chamber. Those talks dealt only with ways to reduce strike-related violence, and they broke down after two sessions. At least six people have died and about 350 have been injured in strike-related violence.    Anglo American, which employs about 40% of the country's 550,000 black miners and produced more than 39% of South Africa's gold last year, threatened again yesterday to fire miners who don't return to work this week. The company had threatened to fire several thousand workers on Monday, but postponed that action. Some 11,000 miners have been fired since the strike began.    Anglo American claims that several thousand striking miners have returned to work. The Chamber of Mines said on Monday that 210,000 miners remain on strike at 29 mines. According to the union, about 340,000 men are on strike at 45 mines.    Anglo American apparently has been hit the hardest by the strike, though none of the mine owners have released any figures concering the walkout's effect on their earnings. Independent analysts have estimated that the strike has cost the mine owners more than $100 million so far and that the miners have lost some $40 million in wages.    Gold alone provides more than half of South Africa's foreign-exchange earnings, but the government has expressed little concern over the strike's impact on the nation's economy.    Gerhard de Kock, governor of South Africa's central bank, said in his annual address to stockholders yesterday that indications are that real growth of gross domestic product will exceed 2% in 1987, but may not reach the 3% projection made earlier this year.    Mr. de Kock said poor business and consumer confidence that prevails amid the political and social tensions in South Africa, and deteriorating overseas perceptions about the nation, are major factors undermining the country's economic recovery.    The official said that for economic policies to succeed in their attempts to encourage an upswing, they will have to be &quot;underpinned by the continued maintenance of law and order, and by further political reform.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
