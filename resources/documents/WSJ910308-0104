A senior administration official called the program the&quot;most dramatic expansion of export controls&quot; sincerestrictions on trade with the Soviet bloc during the 1980s.But the White House said the severity of the new rules isjustified by the need to avert the &quot;chilling specter of germwarfare and nuclear weapons.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   As anticipated, the rules will expand to 50 from 11 thenumber of chemicals that can't be shipped without a licenseto countries that aren't participating in efforts to controlthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Theregulations also will control for the first time exports ofequipment that can be used to make chemical or biologicalweapons and of whole plants that can manufacture any of the50 sensitive chemicals.   State Department officials said controls on such&quot;dual-use&quot; equipment -- which can be used to producecommercial or military goods -- initially will apply to all14 Middle Eastern countries, including friendly ones likeIsrael, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and hostile ones like Libyaand Iraq. The list also includes four Southwest Asiancountries -- Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran and India -- and 10other countries: the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, China,Taiwan, Vietnam, North Korea, Myanmar, Cuba and South Africa.   The rules are due to take effect upon their publication inthe Federal Register, probably next Monday or Tuesday. Theannouncement of related rules will follow, including onesimposing controls on shipments of almost any type of productto projects or facilities involved in manufacturing chemicaland biological weapons or the missiles for delivering them.   Although the White House promised &quot;vigorous efforts&quot; toobtain multilateral enforcement of these controls, Germany sofar is the only other supplier nation that has announced itsintention to adopt similar rules. The State Department saidit is working hard to obtain the cooperation of 18 otherindustrialized countries, which together with the U.S. andGermany make up the so-called Australia Group, an informalgroup that meets twice a year to discuss ways of controllingtrade in sensitive chemicals.   The U.S. also is calling on the 15-nation MissileTechnology Control Regime to adopt tougher rules on exportsof technology that can be used to manufacture long-rangemissiles. A State Department official said the group willmeet in Tokyo next week to discuss further concerted action.   A number of trade groups have expressed misgivings aboutthe rules. They object to the large number of products to becontrolled for the first time and worry that the U.S. isclamping down on American exporters before other countriesjoin the anti-proliferation effort. Randolph Stayin, a lawyerfor three U.S. associations, warned before the rules wereissued that the product list would be &quot;so broad that it couldaffect all of the machinery and equipment that is used in thepetroleum, chemical, water, waste-water and food-processingindustries.&quot;   Another part of the rules would enable the government toprohibit participation by U.S. citizens in overseasconstruction projects thought to be related to weaponsproduction. That marks the first time that constructionservices other than those involving nuclear plants will besubject to export controls.   A list of projects that will be affected has been preparedbut won't be released until later, U.S. officials said.   The officials acknowledged that processing licensesrequired by the new rules could be time-consuming. TheCommerce Department generally is responsible for exportlicensing, but some license applications will have to behandled by other agencies like the State Department and thePentagon, with the risk of further delays.</TEXT></DOC>
