Informal talks resolved remaining disputes on European EconomicCommunity farm subsidies and the issue of ``food security,'' theofficials said.   ``The book is closed on agriculture. We have reached anaccord,'' chief EC farm negotiator Guy Legras told a pressconference.   But he added that ``an enormous amount of work'' remains incontinuing world trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade. He predicted ``intense and difficult'' negotiations overthe next 1{ years.   The tentative accord, which delegates were expected to approveformally later Friday, calls for an overall cap on farm supportsand import barriers through 1990, Legras and other officials said.   It also calls for countries to reduce their subsidies in 1990but does not specify by how much, chief Canadian negotiator GermainDenis said.   The pact meets a Community demand of letting the Europeantrading bloc bring up in future negotiations the issue ofredistributing its agricultural subsidies, Legras said.   He said that senior officials, after three days ofGATT-sponsored negotiations, had set ``clear and precise''objectives for the remainder of the running round of world tradetalks under GATT.   Denis said a committee will meet in six months to assesscompliance with the farm accord. However, violators face nopenalties.   The issue of food security, which preoccupied Japan, Indonesia,the Nordic countries and Switzerland, was resolved by requiringnegotiators to address the problem in the next 20 months, Denissaid.   Officials said those countries were worried that liberalizedtrade arrangements could leave them dependent on food imports.   In the other main dispute, the Community insisted on the rightto redistribute its payments to farmers even while reducing theiroverall level. The United States and other producer countriescharged the European approach ran counter to the goal ofliberalizing trade under the current set of GATT talks, known asthe Uruguay Round.   GATT spokesman David Woods said progress also was made regardingtrade in textiles and clothing, patents and other intellectualproperty rights, and safeguards, or escape clauses for countriesconfronted with a sudden surge of imports.   Those issues, together with the clash over farm policy, held upother agreements reached at a GATT ministerial meeting in Montreallast December. The current four-year round of talks is due to endat the end of 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
