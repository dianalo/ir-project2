(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   At 5 a.m., Alex Raley stepped onto thebalcony of his fourth-floor hotel room in Tbilisi and looked downonto a street filled with protesters, Soviet soldiers and armoredpersonal carriers.   As Raley, an educator from South Carolina, and his wife watchedin the glow of streetlights, what began as a demonstration forindependence for Soviet Georgia turned into a bloody clash thatleft at least 19 people dead.   ``At first, we weren't concerned when we heard the loudnoises,'' Raley said. ``But then we saw Soviet soldiers with metalshields and night sticks, 10 to 15 soldiers deep, filling theentire street.   ``They were literally pushing hundreds of students, who at thattime started throwing stones.''   Raley said the soldiers were followed by tanks. He said studentswho were beaten during the fighting ducked into alleyways and shopsalong Tbilisi's main thoroughfare, Rustaveli Street, for medicalcare. He said 15 ambulances came to help the injured after thetanks ran through the street.   Raley was accompanying 15 high school exchange students fromColumbia, S.C., who had been staying with Georgian families. Theywere flown out of Tbilisi on Tuesday at the request of the Sovietgovernment and now are staying in Moscow until arrangements can bemade for the students to finish their exchange in another city.   All the American students slept through the Sunday morningconflict in the safety of their hosts' homes.   Clare Coggeshall, 16, said, however, she woke after hearing awoman ``wailing for hours.''   ``I remember thinking that I wished she would shut up,'' shesaid.   The next morning, Ms. Coggeshall discovered the woman was themother of one of the demonstrators killed.   The scene was far different from the almost-festive atmospherethe young South Carolinians had found on Wedneday, April 5, whenthey first arrived in this city 900 miles south of Moscow.   On Sunday, black banners hung from balconies, broken glasslittered the strets along with torn official Soviet Georgian flags_ red with a blue strip running across the top. A mural near thecenter of town reading, ``Brotherhood throughout the U.S.S.R.,''was charred at the bottom from being set on fire.   The streets were deserted, and Red Army soldiers broke up anygatherings of more than a few people.   Some of the American students, fearing their parents would beworried, had gathered at one of the homes to try to call home toAmerica. They had no luck.   Their teacher, Sherry Beasley, waited by her phone hoping tohear from the U.S. Embassy or the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Partnership, theorganization that arranged the trip. Neither, she later learnedafter reaching Moscow, could get through on the jammed telephonelines.   Raley, his wife and a crew of four from South CarolinaEducational Television, who were along to film the studentexchange, were trapped in the Hotel Tbilisi, barricaded on bothsides by tanks. None of the Americans had their passports or Sovietvisas with them; the documents had been taken two days earlier toregister them for a trip to the mountains.   It was one of the many sightseeing trips the students never gotto take because of the demonstrations.   When the teen-agers first arrived, their Georgian hosts toldthem _ with a touch of embarrassment _ that students in Tbilisi hadbeen protesting for three days, making travel a little difficult.   Their attitude about the protests was so casual, however, that afew jokes were cracked about its being an attempt by the universitystudents to get out of going to class.   As the young Americans drove into the city, they passedthousands of Georgians jamming Rustaveli Street, holding hands,singing and carrying traditional, homemade Georgian flags ofmaroon, black and white.   Many of the protesters were part of a hunger strike, and theysat wrapped in blankets on the steps of the local televisionstation. Others, crowding the narrow backstreets, had set up puptents in church backyards.   Speeches were given through bullhorns every day at theGovernment Palace, hub of the demonstrations.   By Friday, the State Museum and Tbilisi School No. 1, both nearthe palace, were shut down because of crowds clogging the street.On Saturday afternoon, electricity was cut off to many parts of theGeorgian capital. Rumor had it that power was turned off to silenceloudspeakers at a rally set for 5 p.m.   Several Georgian families quietly made preparations to move theAmerican teen-agers to the nearby mountains or in with relatives onthe outskirts of town.   Students, growing a bit homesick, found they could not contactAmerica or even Moscow by telephone. Their isolation did not enduntil they were whisked out of Tbilisi on Tuesday morning, passingthrough army barricades on the way to the airport.   The students clung to their Georgian families before leaving,saying they felt safe and did not want to go to Moscow.   ``We're just so worried for them,'' said Melissa Milling, 16.``We had gotten so close to them. We don't want to leave thembehind.''   Twelve Georgian students had stayed with the American studentsin February in South Carolina, and the exchange was supposed tolast for three more weeks in Tbilisi.</TEXT></DOC>
