In somecities the cost of labor and wiring materials can top $ 1,000 for eachnetwork node.andP;  Ugly LAN wiring ruins the ambience of a carefully designedoffice suite, and bad wiring can cost a LAN manager his or her job.andP;  The bestwiring is invisible, reliable, and already in place.andP;  Ideally, you choose thewiring once and the choice lasts for years.andM;Before this year, LAN wiring alternatives were limited to Ethernet and ARCnetcoaxial cable and the shielded twisted-pair wiring used in IBM's Token-Ring.andO;But the unshielded twisted-pair wiring residing in the walls of manybuildings has always beckoned to LAN managers, particularly because it isalready in place.andP;  Some companies, including ATandamp;T, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, andWestern Digital offered ways to carry LAN traffic over telephone wire, butthey provided no standards for wiring or signaling and no guaranteedcompatibility.andM;In late summer or fall of 1990, after three years of meetings, proposals, andcompromises, a committee of the Institute of Electrical and ElectronicsEngineers (IEEE) plans to finalize a specification for running Ethernet-typesignaling over twisted-pair wiring.andP;  The IEEE warns that companies cannotdeclare that their products comply with the standard when the standard isn'tfinal, but many companies express confidence that their existing productswill comply with the finished standard as they are, or with a fast ROMchange.andM;The IEEE calls the new standard 802.3 10BaseT.andP;  Current IEEE 802.3 standardsdescribe carrier-sense multiple access signaling, like Ethernet, used overvarious wiring systems.andP;  10BaseT employs a signaling speed of 10 megabits persecond, a baseband signaling scheme, and twisted-pair wiring.andP;  Basebandsignaling involves sending a direct-current voltage down the wire instead ofusing radio waves.andP;  The radio wave scheme, called broadband signaling,attracted some popularity several years ago, but baseband signaling wonbroader acceptance because it's easier to install and maintain.andM;Theoretically, the appeal of the widely touted 10BaseT standard comes fromclaims that it gives LAN managers the option of using installed telephonewiring, saving installation problems and costs.andP;  Keeping things simple andinexpensive is a nice objective, but unfortunately the roadblocks you find inmost real installations don't let you get there from here.andP;  Manyorganizations don't have enough existing high-quality wiring to support anetwork installation, so LAN planners find they must pull more wire anyway.andO;Yet other, subtler benefits of 10BaseT make it worth adopting.andM;THE BAD NEWSandM;Wire, wire everywhere and not an inch to link.andP;  Many types of telephone wiresnake their way through buildings.andP;  Quad, the wiring found in residences,wraps four parallel wires in one cable.andP;  The telephone wiring plants of manyolder buildings contain thick multiconductor cables, used for a keysystem--one using phones with multiple-line buttons.andP;  A few modem buildingswere wired with something the industry called silver satin.andP;  Silver satincable is flat and typically comes in a silver vinyl jacket.andP;  None of thesewiring systems--quad, multiconductor, or silver satin--suit modem LAN dataservices; the wires are not sufficiently resistant to electricalinterference.andM;Buildings wired for modem private branch exchange (PBX) systems in the lastfive to seven years usually have a cabling system of high-qualitytwisted-pair wiring.andP;  Each pair of wires in these cables is twisted togetherso that the electromagnetic fields in both wires cancel each other and reducethe amount of induced electrical interference and radiation.andM;This wire will work for LAN transmission, but according to a Western Digitalwhite paper on 10BaseT installations, &quot;The arrangement of twisted pairs atthe wall jack in a typical telephone installation is usually not acceptablefor network signal transmissions.andP;  &quot; In other words, the right wires don't goto the right pins in the wall jack to complete the connection to the PCadapter.andM;Additionally, most PBX wiring installations provide four pairs of wires tothe wall jack.andP;  The PBX telephone typically uses two of those pairs.andP;  Sincethe 10BaseT connection needs two pairs for itself, there should be enough.andO;But if you have an intercom or other special telephone feature, it often usesthe other pair, leaving you no wires for the LAN.andP;  Also, a rule of thumb saysthat 2 or 3 percent of the wire pairs in an installation are bad.andP;  When thenumber of available pairs is already marginal, attrition takes a big toll.andM;Finally, the twisting of the wires affords some shielding fromelectromagnetic interference, but elevator motors, fluorescent lights,special telephone options, and many other devices emit signals strong enoughto get into the wire and interrupt digital signals.andP;  When you installunshielded wires for 10BaseT, you position the wires to avoid these areas ofhigh electromagnetic noise.andP;  Preexisting PBX wire runs seldom follow the sameguidelines.andM;So, on the bottom line, you will probably have to pull more telephone wirefor a new 10BaseT installation.andP;  Expect to pay about 6 cents a foot, in bulk,for 10BaseT wire, plus the cost of labor and parts such as connection blocksand wall jacks.andP;  Also, budget about $3,000 for a wiring hub able toaccommodate 20 nodes.andP;  This hardware expenditure typically comes to about$150 per port, laying waste to 10BaseT arguments based solely on installationcost.andM;By comparison, thin Ethernet cable is about 25 cents a foot.andP;  With thiscoaxial cable, you can easily use less than half as much wire as if you hadused twisted-pair, since thin Ethernet uses a point-to-point wiring schemeinstead of the 10BaseT star wiring plan.andP;  Your hardware cost for Ethernetamounts to about $5 per station for coaxial cable connectors, assuming theLAN card vendor supplies the needed T connector for each card.andP;  On closeinspection, low cost and the use of existing wiring aren't valid reasons tochoose 10BaseT, so let's examine the real benefits.andM;THE GOOD NEWSandM;Even if you must pull additional twisted-pair wiring to install a 10BaseTLAN, at least you're working with the same wiring used for the telephonesystem.andP;  The technology of twisted-pair wiring, unlike coaxial Ethernetalternatives and Token-Ring's shielded twisted-pair, would be familiar totechnicians you already have on staff or on contract.andP;  If an installer abidesby a few of the IEEE's rules (for example, keeping wire length between acomputer and a hub down to a maximum of 330 feet and avoiding sources ofelectrical noise), the installation is simple.andP;  10BaseT doesn't introducecomplex and ugly cabling, wall jacks, and desktop attachments into youroffice.andM;As we found in the PC LAN Labs, the strong practical appeal of 10BaseTproducts lies in their commonality.andP;  As with Ethernet, you can safely mix andmatch 10BaseT adapter cards and wiring hubs from many companies and use themtogether on the same network.andP;  This commonality provides you with multiplesources of supply, confidence in the availability of long-term support, andcompetitive prices.andM;Our LAN Labs testing also proved that you don't pay a performance penalty forusing 10BaseT twisted-pair.andP;  Throughput tests showed performance asconsistently good as you get with coaxial Ethernet wiring.andP;  Although weinclude a performance comparison in this review, don't spend a lot of timeevaluating the results.andP;  The performance differences between the productscome largely from the driver software.andP;  And companies tend to update theirdriver software frequently.andM;To a network manager, the biggest potential advantage of a 10BaseT wiringinstallation comes from the star wiring scheme.andP;  It provides both reliabilityand centralized management.andP;  It's configured like the hub and spokes of awheel; the wires go from a central wiring hub out to each node.andP;  If one wirerun is broken or shorted, the node goes out of commission, but the networkitself remains operational.andP;  In Token-Ring or thin Ethernet wiring schemes,one bad connection at any point takes down the entire network.andM;During our testing, we completely changed our wiring hubs without taking downthe network.andP;  We worked quickly to let NetWare retry connections, but weswapped between hubs from different companies without a blink or reset.andP;  Thecombination of 10Baset wiring and NetWare tries hard and succeeds in keepingthe network working.andM;The central wiring hub is an ideal lace to install a monitoringmicroprocessor and network management software.andP;  Synoptics Communicationsleads the industry in providing LAN monitoring and management features in awiring hub.andP;  See our review of LAN management software in the November 28,1989, issue of PC Magazine (&quot;LAN Management Systems&quot;) for more information onLAN management software-including Synoptics' LattisNet Network ManagementSystem--in wiring hubs.andM;HUB CONSIDERATIONSandM;Wiring hubs, or concentrators, have advantages and drawbacks.andP;  While thecentralized-hub wiring plan improves overall network reliability and preventsthe network-wide outages possible under coaxial-cabled Ethernet andToken-Ring, hubs have trip points where adding just one more station canrequire the purchase of a new hub.andP;  Also, a faulty hub can break the networkinto isolated sections.andM;Assume that you have a network of exactly 30 server and workstation nodes.andO;Since the average hub accepts 10 nodes, you might presume that you need tobuy only three hubs.andP;  But because you have to interconnect the hubs, fournode connections need to become hub connections (hub A to hub B, hub B to hubC).andP;  This means you have to buy four hubs to connect 30 nodes.andM;The hubs need power.andP;  Even if you have uninterruptible power supplies on theserver and workstations, you'll still lose network connectivity if the powerto the hubs goes out.andP;  Hubs don't draw much power, so the lowest-priced UPSwill power a closetful of wiring hubs.andP;  Power protection for the hubs is onemore thing a smart administrator must plan for.andM;If one hub--say, hub B, which interconnects hubs A and C--should lose powerbecause of a blown fuse or other malfunction, hubs A and C will be isolatedfrom each other.andP;  All of the nodes will be able to communicate within eachhub, but not between hubs.andP;  If a station on hub C wants to use a server onhub A, this outage has the same effect as a total LAN failure.andP;  Fortunately,the diagnostic lights on the 10BaseT wiring hub quickly show the location ofa problem so that you can reestablish important connections.andM;REVIEW CRITERIAandM;In this review, we focus on the 12 companies making 10BaseT network adaptercards.andP;  Many of these companies also make wiring centers, hubs, orconcentrators--the names vary--but we focused on the adapters for tworeasons.andP;  First, the wiring hub products aren't coming to the market asquickly as the adapters.andP;  Second, the LAN management software associated withthe emerging hubs will warrant separate consideration.andM;Even the LAN adapter products are in short supply.andP;  Several additionalcompanies, including D-Link and Racal InterLan, wanted to provide adaptersfor this review, but the demand for their products prevented them fromshipping products to us for our 60- to 90-day testing cycle.andM;DIFFERENTIATING PRODUCTSandM;We'll probably anger a few companies by insisting that products in the10BaseT market have many similar features and often can be usedinterchangeably.andP;  We don't mean to imply that there aren't technicaldifferences, but we do feel that to most buyers the differences between10BaseT adapters won't matter much.andP;  After a few technical considerations,you can safely buy 10BaseT adapters based on price, availability, brand name,and company reputation.andM;As is often the case with products that have so many similarities, the pricesof these cards continue to fall as companies maneuver for position.andP;  We hadto revise prices frequently during our review cycle.andP;  The 8-bit ISA boardsrange in price from $275 to $495; 16-bit boards from $375 to $595; MCA boardsfrom $375 to $695.andM;The adapters we saw varied on a few practical technical points, such as thenumber and types of diagnostic lights on each adapter and whether they setcommunications parameters using jumpers or software.andP;  The diagnostic lightsare valuable--we avoided several time-consuming troubleshooting sessionsduring our testing by just looking at the lights that show connection statusand activity--but most people will focus on three differentiating factorsamong these adapters.andM;The first important factor is the availability of the right software driverinterface for whatever LAN file server software you use.andP;  All of the adapterswe reviewed support NetWare, but only a few provide interfaces forMicrosoft's LAN Manager, Banyan's VINES, and other operating systems.andO;Several companies, like Gateway Communications and Western Digital, nowsupport the Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS), a Microsoftspecification for writing hardware-independent drivers.andP;  Supporting NDISprovides compatibility with all versions of LAN Manager and other operatingsystems like VINES.andM;Western Digital has the best set of adapter card interfaces, including anexcellent implementation of NetBIOS.andP;  If you're buying LAN hardware for anorganization using various LAN file server systems, you should look atWestern Digital's adapters first.andP;  Using these adapters lets you standardizeon one type of hardware.andP;  But if you need only an interface to NetWare, the10BaseT market offers a number of products for you.andM;The second important consideration is the availability of appropriateadapters for a server such as a 16-bit ISA, 32-bit Micro Channel,bus-mastering, or EISA device.andP;  But because you can mix and match 10BaseT,you don't have to use adapters from the same vendors for the servers andworkstations.andM;Some buyers will want to note whether the adapters include an Attachment UnitInterface (AUI) port.andP;  The AUI port connects to a device called atransceiver, or medium attachment unit, and allows the cards to be used withthick and thin Ethernet coaxial cables and fiber-optic cables.andP;  The porttherefore gives you more flexibility and potential for reuse on other wiringschemes.andP;  If you have only a 10BaseT connector and no AUI on the board, youcan use only the 10BaseT wiring plan.andM;One interesting note: the designers of these products seem to possess faithin their quality.andP;  Warranties of three years are common, and some companiescover their boards for as long as five.andM;LESS FEARandM;Installing a wiring system according to the 10BaseT standards might notinitially save you as much money as other LAN wiring alternatives.andP;  But theability to stay operational despite physical wire problems that would crash acoaxial Ethernet network or Token-Ring setup, plus the LAN managementadvantages of 10BaseT, make it a good option for any modem networkinstallation.andM;*  G/EtherTwistandM;*  EtherCard Plus10TandM;We expect some arguments, but we maintain that the current 10BaseT marketconsists of products so similar that technical differences among them do notmatter much.andP;  If so, buyers of these adapters should be able to base theirchoices on market factors such as cost, availability, company reputation, andspecial features.andM;Given those criteria, many buyers would choose G/EtherTwist from GatewayCommunications.andP;  Gateway offers aggressive prices, a family of adapters forall types of PCs, worldwide availability and support, a strong reputation asa value-added reseller of Novell's NetWare, and lots of LEDS, AUI ports, andboot ROM sockets on its boards.andM;Certainly, however, wise buyers--particularly those not under Novell'sthrall--should also patronize Western Digital Corp. for its EtherCard Plus10Tline.andP;  An international leader in chip technology, Western Digital provideswidely available and aggressively priced products, including adapters withthe necessary indicators, sockets, and attachments, and a floppy disk full ofdrivers that is the answer to a network manager's prayers.andM;If your network is pure Novell, then you can make Gateway your one-stop shop.andO;But if you might want to integrate LAN Manager, TCP/IP, and other operatingsystem and transport/session-layer protocols into your facility, then headdue west for a Western-style roundup.andM;MEETING FCC STANDARDS:andM;Can You See the Light?andM;A good test for quality in both conventional Ethernet and 10BaseT adapters isto hold them up to the light.andP;  If you see light through a clearly definedarea on the board, you know that the designer of the board worked with thetough FCC Class B emission standards in mind.andM;It's no easy task to design 10BaseT boards that meet strict FCC and Europeanspecifications on emitted radiation.andP;  Engineers know that the harmonics ofsquare waves are infinite.andP;  The signals on the wire form square waves andgenerate harmonics all through the radio spectrum.andP;  Designers use a wholevariety of innovative techniques, including complex circuits, to filter andreduce these troublesome harmonic emissions.andM;The light you see when you examine an Ethernet or 10BaseT adapter shinesthrough an area where the normal ground-plane layer of the card has beenremoved.andP;  When high-frequency signals are present on an adapter, designengineers have to work hard to make sure those signals don't become coupledto the computer's chassis.andP;  If they are allowed to couple, the AC power linecan act like an antenna and spread the unwanted signals far and wide.andO;Isolating certain components from the ground plane is an important techniqueengineers use to meet FCC Class B certification.andM;If you can't see the light, the isolated island might just be covered up byadditional board layers, but it's more likely that the key section of groundplane is still there.andP;  Most designers seem proud of their success in creatinga board able to meet strict emission standards and tend to make their workvisible.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
