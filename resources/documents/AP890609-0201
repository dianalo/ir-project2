The army on Thursday allowed the people of Beijing their firstglance of the 100-acre expanse since the military swept into thecapital six days ago, leaving hundreds dead and crushing a movementfor political change.   Troops moved back their barricades, making it possible for cityresidents to walk to the edge of the square, which for seven weeksstood at the heart of the movement. Buses and bicyclists today wereallowed to pass by Changan Avenue, which borders the north edge ofthe square.   The spot once occupied by the Goddess of Democracy, a33-foot-high replica of the Statue of Liberty, was taken by atread-wheeled armored personnel carrier. When students built thestatue last week, for a few days it became a symbol of the movementfor democratic reforms and an end to official corruption. On Sundaymorning, a tank crushed it.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush refuses to fix blame for themassacre in Beijing but says it would be ``extraordinarilydifficult'' to have ties with anyone responsible for the bloodshed.   Bush, in the first prime-time news conference of his presidency,said Thursday night that the United States won't have normalrelations with China until the government there recognizes demandsfor democracy.   Despite a military crackdown that killed hundreds if notthousands of people in Beijing, Bush emphasized Thursday night thathe wants to ``preserve the relationship'' with China.   But for that relationship to be normal, he said, ``it will take arecognition of the rights of individuals and respect for the rightsof those who disagree.''</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some Chinese army officers favor the goals of thedemocracy movement, but the military as a whole is still largelysympathetic to hard-liners who ordered the recent crackdown,academic experts on China say.   Any conflicts within the military over the handling of studentunrest are unlikely to flare into major confrontations among armyunits, they say.   ``The army has always opted for unity. The instinct of mostChinese soldiers is to unite behind bad policy instead of breakingup,'' said Harvey Jencks, a research associate at the University ofCalifornia at Berkeley and an expert on the Chinese military.   Economic reforms have increased inflation in China, eroding thevalue of military wages and making the army sympathetic to hard-linepolicies, many experts said.</TEXT><DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dr. Jonas Salk's report that an experimentalvaccine eliminated AIDS infection in two chimpanzees demonstratestreatment for the deadly disease is possible, but scientists say itis only one of several promising findings.   ``These are the beginnings of progress we didn't have a yearago,'' said Dani Bolognesi of Duke University, a leading authorityon AIDS vaccine research.   Speaking Thursday at the Fifth International Conference on AIDS,Bolognesi said researchers at the New England Primate ResearchCenter had blocked an AIDS-like infection in monkeys.   And researchers at Repligen in Cambridge, Mass., working withBolognesi and others, showed that antibodies to a tiny portion ofthe AIDS virus's outer surface could prevent infection inchimpanzees.</TEXT><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Small amounts of alcohol may help older people,but a government workshop says alcohol abuse can worsen diseases ofthe aging, particularly heart disease.   More research is needed into the relationship between alcohol andcardiovascular disease, especially as the population ages, theworkshop said in a report. Heart disease is the most common killerof Americans 65 and older.   The recommendations from the Surgeon General's Workshop on HealthPromotion and Aging were published Thursday by the federal Centersfor Disease Control.   It noted that between 1950 and 1980 the number of Americans 65and older increased from 12.5 million to 25.5 million, with thelargest increase in the 85-and-older group. The percentage ofAmericans older than 65 is 12 percent now and will be 21.1 percentby the year 2030, the report said.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Partisan disputes over Jim Wright's ethics andRepublican opposition to a key reform threaten President Bush's planto protect depositors from $100 billion in losses by failed savingsand loans.   The debate is taking on a more political tinge as the full Houseprepares to deal with the bill next week.   House GOP leaders threatened on Thursday to blame the financialcrisis _ the largest in the nation since the Depression _ oninfluence peddling for Sandamp;Ls by the fallen House speaker and fellowDemocratic leader Tony Coelho. Both Wright and Coelho are leavingthe House under fire on ethics issues.   Democrats, meanwhile, began making an issue of GOP House members'opposition to the reforms that Bush has requested. The Republicansare trying to weaken a key reform that Bush says is needed toprevent a similar debacle in the future _ requiring Sandamp;L owners toput up more of their own money when making speculative loans.</TEXT><DATELINE>EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Veterans of the pioneeringX-15 program gathered to swap ``Right Stuff'' tales aboutedge-of-space flight before the breakthroughs of space shots andspace shuttles.   Three decades ago the rocket-powered X-15 ``spaceplane'' firstsoared 67 miles over the desert and helped usher in a new era inaeronautics. Fifty miles above Earth was considered the edge ofspace, earning coveted astronaut wings for Air Force fliers in theX-15 program.   The three X-15 hypersonic research aircraft flew 199 flights inone of the most successful aeronautical programs ever conducted.   Neil Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the moon, was amongthe dozen or so military and civilian test pilots who flew the X-15during the program operated jointly by the Air Force, Navy andNational Aeronautics and Space Administration.</TEXT></DOC>
