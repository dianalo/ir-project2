The municipal system alsoserves some large non-residential users, including Kaiser Cement Corp. and DeAnza Community College.;    Rates for non-residential users also increasedlast week, but in most cases, the price hike will be less steep than forhouseholds.;    California Water Service Co. and San Jose Water Co. serve theother two-thirds of Cupertino's homes, as well as most of its businesses.Those suppliers are currently applying to the Public Utilities Commission forrate hikes, according to Bert Viskovich, Cupertino's director of publicworks.;    By comparison, Cupertino households in the California Water systemnow pay about $22 a month, while San Jose Water customers pay an average ofabout $20, according to city figures.;    Viskovich said the city's watersupplier, the Santa Clara Valley Water District, is doubling the rates itcharges Cupertino for the increasingly precious commodity.;    The typicalhousehold in the municipal water system uses about 1,050 gallons of water amonth. That amount represents approximately 25 percent less use than in 1987.;   During the critical summer months, residential use has dropped as much as30 percent compared to 1987.;    City spokeswoman Donna Krey said the city'sgoal has been to reduce consumption by 20 percent. Residents are doing morethan their share, she said.;    &quot;People in this town seem to understand thesituation,&quot; she said.;    Viskovich said commercial users of the city's watersystem have scaled back about 10 percent. He said it is harder for companiesto achieve dramatic cutbacks because jobs and economic well-being are oftenrelated to water consumption.;    The Kaiser Cement quarry in the Cupertinofoothills, for example, uses huge amounts of water as a necessary part of itsoperation, Viskovich said. Large cutbacks in consumption could seriouslyaffect such businesses.;    Under the new rate structure, the worstwater-wasters in the residential sector could see their rates triple.;    InFebruary the city sent warning letters to about 15 households that were usingexcessive amounts of water. Consumption at those homes will be monitored forthe next bimonthly billing period, and &quot;if they do not improve, we willinstall flow restricters,&quot; said Viskovich.;    &quot;When you start going two andthree times the average is when you start getting penalized two- andthreefold,&quot; he said.;    Restrictions of water use are already in place inCupertino that prohibit using water in decorative fountains, hosing downsidewalks, and washing cars without a shutoff valve on hoses.;    Last week,the city added more restrictions, such as limiting watering of golf coursesand draining and refilling swimming pools, except for safety or healthreasons. &quot;There's no reason to do it during the drought,&quot; said Viskovich.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BERNARD BAUER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910515  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  508  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday May 15, 199100136306,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
