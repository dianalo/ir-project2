The 1st District Court of Appeal did not decide if the law wasconstitutional, but upheld a San Francisco judge's decision thatabortion-rights groups had shown a likelihood of overturning thelaw on privacy grounds.   Enforcement of the law is to remain blocked at least until thecase goes to trial, unless the ruling is overturned by the stateSupreme Court.   Among other things, the court said, abortion-rights supportersoffered evidence ``which indicates that all but a very fewadolescent minors have the capacity for exercising mature judgmentconcerning the wisdom of an abortion,'' and that theparental-consent requirement would cause potentially dangerousdelays.   If that evidence proves true, the court said, it would tend toshow that the law invaded minors' privacy without being justifiedby a ``compelling state interest.''   ``Since (the law) will severely impair, or totally deny, theexercise of an intimate and fundamental constitutional right, theburden at trial will be upon (state officials) to prove they have acompelling interest in the regulation of unemancipated minors'consent to an abortion,'' said Justice William Stein in a 3-0decision.   The plaintiffs in the lawsuit were doctors, individual minorsand abortion-rights supporters.   The ruling continues a ban on enforcement of the law, which wasscheduled to take effect in January 1988 but was blocked a few daysearlier by a Superior Court judge.   The appellate decision relied on California's constitutionalright of privacy, passed by voters in 1972. The court followedprevious rulings that the state constitutional right is broaderthan federal privacy rights, and rejected the state's argumentsthat privacy protections do not extend equally to minors.   The ruling comes after a recent Florida Supreme Court decisionoverturning that state's parental consent law, also on stateprivacy grounds.   The use of the state Constitution is important because similarlaws in other states have been upheld by federal courts under U.S.constitutional standards.   The California law would prohibit an unmarried woman under 18,living at home, from getting an abortion without the consent of oneparent. As an alternative, she could go to a judge, who would allowthe abortion based on a conclusion that the minor was mature enoughto make the decision or that it was in her best interest.   State officials have said 34,000 women under 18 got abortions inCalifornia in 1985, the most recent figures available.   The case could give the state Supreme Court's new majority,appointed by anti-abortion Gov. George Deukmejian, a chance tore-examine the scope of state privacy rights.   Deciding what he described as the only issue before the court,Stein said the lower court judge did not abuse his discretion indeciding that opponents of the law had met the standard for aninjunction blocking its enforcement: that enforcement would cause``irreparable harm'' and that they had a likelihood of proving attrial that the law was unconstitutional.   Attorney General John Van de Kamp, the lead defendant in thecase, had argued that an invasion of a minor's privacy could bejustified by a ``significant state interest.'' Stein and hiscolleagues disagreed, saying the state must show a ``compellinginterest,'' the standard that also applies to adults.   ``There is no argument that the protection of minors fromphysical, psychological and emotional harm manifests a comepllingstate interest,'' Stein said.</TEXT></DOC>
