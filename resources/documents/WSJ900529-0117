Winter   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>05/29/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A8</SO><IN>INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT, MACHINE TOOLS (IND)ECONOMIC AND MONETARY INDICATORS (EMI)ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)</IN><LP>   The nation's manufacturers are buying machinery somewhatmore willingly than they did three months ago, machine toolproducers say. And there's no indication so far that evensmall manufacturers are feeling a credit crunch, industryexecutives add.   U.S. machine tool plants in April received $289.5 millionof orders, a 19% rise from $242.6 million a year earlier,according to the NMTBA -- The Association for ManufacturingTechnology , a McLean, Va., trade group. Last month's orderswere up 8.9% from March, and were 49% higher than February's$194.6 million, this year's low.</LP><TEXT>   Unlike March, when a big Soviet order bolstered the total,the April rise resulted from increased ordering by U.S.factories.   However, machine tool distributors, who handleforeign-made machines as well as those produced in the U.S.,reported a sharp drop in orders during April. An order indexpublished by the American Machine Tool Distributors'Association, Rockville Pike, Md., dropped 27% from theyear-earlier month. The index is quite volatile, and theMarch report was unusually strong, which suggests that theApril drop may result from an accidental bunching of ordersrather than the start of a downtrend.   Machine tools are complex part-making machines rangingfrom computer-controlled lathes and machining centers tometal-forming presses. Orders are a good indicator ofspending by durable-goods manufacturers because machine toolsshape most metal parts.   &quot;Business is very good,&quot; said Stephen M. Peterson, vicepresident, sales, for Giddings andamp; Lewis Inc., Fond du Lac,Wis. &quot;We see some real confidence out there among ourcustomers.&quot;   Jet engine manufacturers, construction equipment concernsand pump manufacturers have been ordering actively, Mr.Peterson said. &quot;We're getting some military business, thoughnot as much as last year, and there's quite a bit of activityin the oil country&quot; after a prolonged period when the oilfield equipment industry was dormant.   Also, Giddings andamp; Lewis recently sold twocomputer-controlled manufacturing cells in the Far East, onein Singapore and the other in Taiwan, he said. Cells consistof several machine tools served by automatedmaterials-handling equipment and controlled by a computerthat can make a variety of parts without a human operator.   &quot;Our second quarter is better than the first,&quot; said DonaldD. Bowers, president of Leblond Makino Machine Tool Co.,Mason, Ohio. &quot;Companies committed to long-term objectives&quot; inimproving productivity and product quality &quot;are orderingequipment to carry out those programs,&quot; he added. But othercompanies that base their equipment buying on the immediatebusiness outlook are holding back.   Auto companies and auto suppliers remain a weak spot, saidHarold J. Winch, president of Minster Machine Co., a majorproducer of stamping presses in Minster, Ohio. &quot;They'reweighing a lot of decisions right now, including plasticversus metal parts, government fuel economy standards, cleanair legislation and next year's auto sales outlook.&quot; Untilthey hash out those decisions, auto concerns are deferringsome capital spending decisions.   Machine tool producers frequently sell to small machineshops, which would be among the marginal borrowers deniedloans in a credit crunch. So far, at least, that doesn'tappear to be happening, machine tool executives say.   &quot;I haven't seen any evidence of a credit crunch,&quot; saidMinster Machine's Mr. Winch. &quot;A company with a decent balancesheet doesn't have any more trouble getting a loan&quot; than itdid last year.   There has been concern that banks would tighten lendingstandards following the high loan losses sustained by banksand thrifts, and the resulting closer scrutiny of bank loanportfolios by government regulators. There's been sometightening on real estate development lending, butmanufacturing has been affected relatively little so far.   &quot;There is no evidence of a credit crisis . . . nor isthere much reason to expect one,&quot; said Gail D. Fosler, chiefeconomist for the Conference Board, a New York business andeconomic research group. The slower growth in bank loansresults from lower loan demand in a slow-growing economyrather than more stringent lending standards, she said.   April orders for lathes, grinders, milling machines,machining centers, boring mills and other machines that shapemetal parts by cutting rose 35% to $206.9 million from $152.8million a year earlier. However, April 1989 was the firstmonth of an order slowdown by the auto industry, after 18months of active buying, making for an easier comparison.Nonetheless, the latest month's orders were up 8.9% fromMarch's $198.2 million, despite the inclusion in March of a$38 million Soviet order received by Cross andamp; Trecker Corp.,Bloomfield Hills, Mich.   Orders last month for metal-forming presses and othermachines to shape metal with pressure were $82.6 million, theNMTBA said, down 8% from the year-earlier month's $89.8million, but up 22% from $67.7 million in March.   Shipments of all types of machine tools by domestic plantstotaled $258.2 million, a 3.5% rise from $249.6 million inApril 1989.   ---                   April 1990    March 1990    April 1989                                                                                                        Comparative new orders for metal-cutting machines:                                                                                                        Domestic ......  $187,650,000  $132,600,000  $138,500,000 Foreign .......    19,200,000    65,600,000    14,300,000   Total .......   206,850,000   198,200,000   152,800,000   Four-month total for 1990: $662,500,000; for 1989:$755,350,000.
