Case studies reveal that the most common cause of formationdamage is the rock-fluid interaction that occurs when introduced fluidsupset the equilibrium that exists between a formation's pore fluids andminerals such as clays, carbonates, and anhydrite. Clay minerals areparticularly sensitive to changes in pore-fluid chemistry. Minerals mayswell and disperse during injection of fresh water, whereas during streaminjection they typically react to form smectites. Both effects reducepermeability. Clays also may adsorb surfactants or Na/sup +/ and reducetertiary flooding efficiency. Finally, clays and other fines can be physicallymobilized during production, plug pore throats, and reduce permeability.Combined laboratory core flooding and petrographic investigations ofexploration and appraisal core are required to predict the damage thatmay occur during field development. Criteria should be established enablingdrilling, completion, injection, and stimulation program design to minimizeor avoid damage during field development. Successful predictions on thisbasis may have an immediate and beneficial impact, reducing developmentcosts and improving recovery efficiency.</TEXT></DOC>
