Eytan Bentsur, head of the Israeli delegation to an internationalgovernment-industry conference on chemical weapons in Canberra,called for separate talks between Israel and individual Arab stateson a ban.   But Egypt, Iraq and Iran dismissed the idea of such a ban duringinterviews earlier this week. They either ruled out regional accordsentirely or argued that nuclear weapons should be included in thetalks.   Israel is believed to possess both chemical and nuclear weapons.   Bentsur appealed to the nations of the Middle East ``not to waitfor the completion of a (global) convention, but to work on aunilateral or regional basis.''   He also attacked Algeria for its refusal to allow Israel to jointhe Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament, which is working to drawup a global ban.   Referring to Libya and Syria, two hard-line Arab states, Bentsursaid, ``It is doubly important the convention be universal andall-binding in the light of the fact that two states known to beproducing and stockpiling huge arsenals of chemical weapons whoconstitute a serious threat to the neighboring states have chosennot to participate in this conference.''   The Canberra conference, which began Tuesday, has attractedgovernment and industry representatives from 67 nations. Friday wasits last day.   It was the first time industry has been involved in talks on achemical weapons ban and led to an international industry agreementto help ban the weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
