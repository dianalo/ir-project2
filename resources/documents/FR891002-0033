This freshwater mussel historically occurredin the Ohio River and many of its large tributaries in Pennsylvania, WestVirginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Virginia.Presently, the fanshell is believed to be reproducing in only three rivers_theGreen and Licking Rivers in Kentucky, and the Clinch River in Tennesseeand Virginia. Additionally, small, apparently nonreproducing populations(based on the collection of a few old specimens in the 1980s) may stillpersist in the Muskingum River, Ohio; the Kanawha River, West Virginia;the Wabash River system in Illinois and Indiana; Tygarts Creek, Kentucky;and the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers in Tennessee.

This freshwatermussel is characterized as a medium to large river species (Bates and Dennis1985). The mussel has a medium-size shell (seldom exceeding 3.2 inches(80 millimeters) in length) that is subcircular in outline (Johnson 1980).The shell exterior has green rays on a light green or yellow surface ornamentedwith green mottling. The inside surface of the shell (nacre) is usuallysilvery white. Like other freshwater mussels, this animal feeds by filteringfood particles from the water. It has a complex reproductive cycle in whichthe mussel's larvae likely parasitize fish. The mussel's life span, parasitichost, and most aspects of its life history are unknown. Since the turn of the century, the fanshell has undergone a substantialreduction in its range. It was historically widely distributed in the Ohio,Wabash, Cumberland, and Tennessee Rivers and their larger tributaries inPennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee,Alabama, and Virginia (Johnson 1980, Kentucky Nature Preserves Commission1980, Ahlstedt 1986, Bates and Dennis 1985, Lauritsen 1987, Cummings <T3>et al.</T3> 1987 and 1988. Starnes and Bogan 1988). The loss of manyhistoric populations was likely due to the impacts of impoundments, navigationprojects, pollution, and habitat alterations such as gravel and sand dredging,that directly affected the species and reduced or eliminated its fish host.Based on a review of current literature on the species (see above) andon the following personal communications and letters involving knowledgeableindividuals and State and Federal agency personnel, it is believed thatreproducing populations are now present in only three rivers_the ClinchRiver, Hancock County, Tennessee, and Scott County, Virginia; the GreenRiver, Hart and Edmonson Counties, Kentucky; and the Licking River, Kenton,Campbell, and Pendleton Counties, Kentucky (Steven Ahlstedt and John Jenkinson,Tennessee Valley Authority, personal communication, 1988; Robert Andersonand Mark Gordon, Tennessee Cooperative Fishery Research Unit, personalcommunication, 1988; Carl Becker, Illinois Department of Conservation,<T3>in litt.</T3>, 1988; Charles Bier, Western Pennsylvania Conservancy,<T3>in litt.</T3>, 1989; Richard Connor and William Sinozich, U.S. ArmyCorps of Engineers, <T3>in litt.</T3>, 1989; Kevin Cummings, Illinois Natural History Survey,<T3>in litt.</T3>, 1989; Ronald Cicerello and Richard Hannan, KentuckyNature Preserves Commission, <T3>in litt.</T3>, 1988; Wendal Haag, Ohio State University Museum of Zoology,<T3>in litt.</T3>, 1988; Edward Hansen, Indiana Division of Fish and Wildlife,<T3>in litt.</T3>, 1989; Patricia Jones, Ohio Department of Natural Resources,<T3>in litt.</T3>, 1988; Richard Neves, Virginia Cooperative Fish and WildlifeResearch Unit, <T3>in litt.</T3>, 1988; Brian McDonald and Michael Zeto, West VirginiaDepartment of Natural Resources, <T3>in litt.</T3>, 1988 and 1989; James Sickle, Murray State University,personal communication, 1989; Clarke Shiffer, Pennsylvania Fish and GameCommission, personal communication, 1989; William Tolin, U.S. Fish andWildlife Service, personal communication, 1988; and Paul Yokley, Universityof North Alabama, personal communication, 1988). Additionally, small remnant,apparently nonreproducing populations (based on collections of a few oldindividuals in the 1980s) may still persist in the Muskingum River in Morganand Washington Counties, Ohio; the Wabash River in White and Wabash Counties,Illinois, and Posey County, Indiana; the East Fork White River, MartinCounty, Indiana; the Tippecanoe River, Tippecanoe County, Indiana; theKanawha River, Fayette County, West Virginia; Tygarts Creek, Greenup andCarter Counties, Kentucky; the Cumberland River, Smith County, Tennessee;and the Tennessee River, Rhea, Meigs, and Hardin County, Tennessee. The population in the Green River is likely the best of the three remainingreproducing populations. Fresh dead fanshells of various age classes fromjuvenile to adults have been recently (1987 and 1988) found in muskratmiddens along the Green River (Ronald Cicerello, personal communication,1988). However, the Green River, which lies partially within the MammothCave National Park, is not free from threats. The river's mussel faunahave been seriously depleted. Cicerello (personal communication, 1988),based on his 1987 and 1988 surveys of the Green River within and abovethe Mammoth Cave National Park, believes that about forty mussel speciesstill survive in the area. Ortmann (1926) reported finding 66 species ofmussels in the Green River. The Green River has been degraded by runofffrom oil and gas exploration and production sites and by alteration ofstream flows by an upstream reservoir.The Clinch River fanshell population extends over about 86 river miles(Ahlstedt 1986). However, a Tennessee Valley Authority (1988) survey reportedthat the fanshell comprised less than 1 percent of the mussels collectedat 11 Clinch River quantitative sampling sites in 1979 and 1988. The TennesseeValley Authority (1988) also reported that overall mussel abundance inthe Clinch River has decreased from an average of 11.64 mussels per squaremeter in 1979 to 6.00 per square meter in 1988. The Clinch River also hasenvironmental problems. Charles Sledd (Virginia Commission of Game andInland Fisheries, personal communication, 1988) stated that land use practicesalong the Clinch River have contributed to a decline in water quality andmussel populations. The Clinch River has experienced some adverse impactsfrom coal mining, and the river has been subjected to two mussel killsresulting from toxic substance spills from a riverside coal-fired powerplant.The Licking River also supports a reproducing fanshell population (RonaldCicerello, personal communication, 1989). Live and fresh-dead individualsof several year classes have been collected. However, despite collectionsmade throughout the drainage by Kentucky Nature Preserve Commission biologists,the species is only known from the lower portion of the Licking River.This population could potentially be threatened by some of the water supplydevelopment alternatives presently under preliminary review for the LickingRiver watershed.The fanshell was recognized by the Service in the May 22, 1984, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (49 FR 21664) and January 6, 1989, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 554) as a category 2 species. (A category2 species is one that is being considered for possible addition to theFederal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants.) On December6, 1988, the Service notified by mail (150 letters) Federal and State agencieswithin the species' historic range, local governments within the species'present range, and interested individuals that a status review was beingconducted specifically to determine if the fanshell should be protectedunder the Act. A total of 22 written responses was received as a resultof the December 6, 1988, notification. No objections to the potential listingof the fanshell were received, and much information on the species' statusand its former and present distribution was provided.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531, <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth procedures for adding speciesto the Federal list. A species may be determined to be endangered or threateneddue to one or more of the five factors described in Section 4(a)(1). Thesefactors and their application to the fanshell (<T3>Cyprogenia stegaria </T3>(=<T3>C. irrorata</T3>)) are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range.</T3> The fanshell was apparently once widespreadin the Ohio River and its larger tributaries in Pennsylvania, West Virginia,Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Tennessee, Alabama, and Virginia (Johnson1980). Johnson (1980) reported that the species was formerly known fromat least 26 rivers. Many of these historically known populations were evidentlylost when riverine habitat in the Ohio River system was converted to aseries of large reservoirs. These reservoirs and other habitat alteringfactors (e.g. navigation projects and gravel and sand dredging) have diminishedthe species' preferred riverine gravel/sand habitat and eliminated or reducedthe availability of the mussel's fish host. As a result, this species'distribution has been substantially reduced.The following is a review by State of the species' status (see ``Background''section for additional information on the species' status).<T3>Pennsylvania: </T3>No definitive study of Pennsylvania's mussel faunahas been conducted in more than 50 years. However, based on the musselsurvey data that are available and the documented history of habitat degradationthat has occurred in the Pennsylvania rivers where the species was foundearly in this century, it is presumed that the species has been extirpatedfrom the State (Clarke Shiffer, personal communication, 1989; and CharlesBier, <T3>in litt., </T3>1989). <T3>West Virginia: </T3>In 1982 one old fresh-dead fanshell was collectedbelow Kanawha Falls on the Kanawha River (William Tolin, personal communication,1988). This is the only recent record of the species in West Virginia,and the species is believed to be very rare in the State (Brian McDonaldand Michael Zeto, <T3>in litt., </T3>1988 and 1989).<T3>Ohio: </T3>Based on letters from Wendal Haag (1988) and Patricia Jones(1989), the only recent (1980s) records for Ohio rivers are from the MuskingumRiver, and these were all large old individuals. Clayton Lakes (Ohio Departmentof Natural Resources, <T3>in litt., </T3>1988) stated: ``We believe <T3>Cyprogenia stegaria </T3>should be protected under the 1973 FederalEndangered Species Act.''<T3>Indiana: </T3>The species was found at a few sites in the Wabash Riversystem during 1987 and 1988 (Kevin Cummings, <T3>in litt., </T3>1989); Jim Engel, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, <T3>in litt., </T3>1989). However, these collections were represented byonly a few live or fresh-dead old individuals. Edward Hansen (<T3>in litt., </T3>1989) stated that the fanshell was historically commonin the Wabash River system but that recent surveys (1987 and 1988) documenta dramatic decline in the species. The State of Indiana has classifiedthe species as endangered, and the Indiana Division of Fish and Wildlifesupports protection of the species under the Endangered Species Act.<T3>Illinois: </T3>The fanshell (based on the collection of a few old specimens)is presently known in Illinois only from the Wabash River (Kevin Cummings,<T3>in litt., </T3>1989). The species was added to the Illinois list ofendangered species in March 1989 (Carl Becker, pers. comm., 1987). Beckerfurther stated: ``The Wabash River experienced heavy commercial musselingpressure from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s. Since that time, none ofthe river's mussel populations seem to have recovered very well.''<T3>Kentucky: </T3>The Kentucky Nature Preserve Commission, which classifiesthe species as threatened (Warren <T3>et al. </T3>1986), reported that the fanshell was historically takenfrom 10 reaches of Kentucky rivers (Richard Hannan, <T3>in litt., </T3>1988). Presently, the species is known to survive inonly three Kentucky rivers and to reproduce in only two.<T3>Tennessee: </T3>In Tennessee, a few old specimens apparently stillsurvive in the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers (Bob Anderson, Stephen Ahlstedt,Mark Gordon, and Paul Yokley, personal communication, 1989); however, thereis no indication that the species is reproducing in either of these rivers.The only known Tennessee population that is believed to still be reproducingis in the Clinch River above Norris Reservoir (Stephen Ahlstedt, personalcommunication, 1989). The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (Robert Hatcher,<T3>in litt., </T3>1989) stated: ``. . . we support any appropriate meansof protecting this species and its habitats.''<T3>Alabama: </T3>Johnson (1980) reported that the species historicallywas taken in Alabama from the Tennessee River and its tributary, the FlintRiver. Based on literature records and personal communication with speciesexperts (see ``Background'' section of this rule) the species is believedto be extirpated from the State of Alabama.<T3>Virginia: </T3>The only historic record of the fanshell for Virginiais from the Clinch River (Johnson 1980). Although rare, the species stillsurvives as a reproducing population in the Clinch River (Tennessee ValleyAuthority 1988). The Virginia Commission of Game and Inland Fisheries supportsconsideration of the species for protection under the Act (Charles Sledd,<T3>in litt., </T3>1988).B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes. </T3>Although the species is not commercially valuable, it doesexist in small numbers within some harvested mussel beds, and the speciescan therefore sometimes be taken by mussel fishermen. Also, the speciesis rare and prized by private and institutional collectors. Thus, takedoes pose some threat to the species. Federal protection could help tominimize the take of individuals.C. <T3>Disease or predation. </T3>Although the fanshell is undoubtedly consumedby predatory animals, there is no evidence that predation threatens thespecies. However, freshwater mussel die-offs have recently (early to mid-1980s)been reported throughout the Mississippi River basin, including the TennesseeRiver and its tributaries (Richard Neves, personal communication, 1986).The cause of the die-offs has not been determined, but significant losseshave occurred to some populations.D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. </T3>States withinthe species' range prohibit taking fish and wildlife, including freshwatermussels, for scientific purposes without a State collecting permit. However,the species is generally not protected from other threats. Federal listingwill provide additional protection for the species under the EndangeredSpecies Act from mussel collectors by requiring Federal permits to takethe species, and by requiring Federal agencies to consult with the Servicewhen projects they fund, authorize, or carry out may adversely affect thespecies.E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>Only 3 of the 12 remaining populations are believed to be reproducing.Therefore, unless methods can be developed to maintain the nonreproducingpopulations, about 75 percent of the known populations will be lost inthe foreseeable future due to their inability to reproduce.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list the fanshell (<T3>Cyprogenia stegaria</T3> (=<T3>C. irrorata</T3>)) as an endangered species. Historical records revealthat the species was once much more widely disturbed in many of the largerivers of the Ohio River system. Presently only three isolated, reproducingpopulations are known to survive. Due to the species' history of populationlosses and the vulnerability of the three remaining reproducing populations,endangered status appears to be the most appropriate classification forthis species. (See ``Critical Habitat'' section for a discussion of whycritical habitat is not being proposed for the fanshell.)<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary propose critical habitat at thetime the species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Servicefinds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent for the fanshellat this time, owing to the lack of benefits from such designation. TheU.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Tennessee Valley Authority are thetwo Federal agencies most involved, and they, along with the State naturalresources agencies within the species' range, are already aware of thelocation of the remaining populations that would be affected by any activitiesin these river reaches. Both Federal agencies have conducted numerous studiesin these river basins and are knowledgeable of the fauna and of their projects'potential impacts. No additional benefits would accrue from critical habitatdesignation that would not also accrue from the listing of the species.In addition, this species is so rare that taking for scientific purposesand private collection could be a threat. The publication of critical habitatmaps and other publicity accompanying critical habitat designation couldincrease that threat. The locations of populations of this species haveconsequently been described only in general terms in this proposed rule.Any existing precise locality data would be available to appropriate Federal,State, and local governmental agencies through the Service office describedin the <T2>``ADDRESSES'' </T2>section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitionagainst taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this intragency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed criticalhabitat. If a species is subsequently listed, Section 7(a)(2) requiresFederal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a speciesor destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federalagency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.The Service notified Federal agencies that may have programs affectingthe species. No specific proposed Federal actions were identified. Federalactivities that could occur and impact the species include, but are notlimited to, the carrying out or the issuance of permits for hydroelectricfacility construction and operation, reservoir construction, river channelmaintenance, stream alterations, wastewater facility development, and roadand bridge construction. It has been the experience of the Service, however,that nearly all Section 7 consultations can be resolved so that the speciesis protected and the project objectives met. In fact, many of the areasinhabited by the fanshell are also inhabited by other mussels that havebeen federally listed since 1976, and the Service has a history in manyof these areas of successful Section 7 conflict resolutions.The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth aseries of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangeredwildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subjectto the jurisdiction of the United States to take (which includes harass,harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, or collect; or to attemptany of these), import or export, ship in interstate commerce in the courseof commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate of foreigncommerce any listed species. It is also illegal to possess, sell, deliver,carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally.Certain exceptions would apply to agents of the Service and State conservationagencies.Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingendangered wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governingpermits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available for scientificpurposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/orfor incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited</ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningany aspect of this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularlyare sought concerning:(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to this species;(2) The location of any additional populations of this species and thereasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be criticalhabitat as provided by Section 4 of the Act;(3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and populationsize of this species; and(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possibleimpacts on this species.Final promulgation of the regulation on this species will take into considerationthe comments and any additional information received by the Service, andsuch communications may lead to adoption of a final regulation that differsfrom this proposal.The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date of thepublication of the proposal. Such requests must be made in writing andaddressed to the Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, AshevilleField Office, 100 Otis Street, Room 224, Asheville, North Carolina 28801.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto Section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Ahlstedt, S.A. 1986.
