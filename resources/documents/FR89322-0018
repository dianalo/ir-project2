Introduction and Summary </ITAG>The Postal Rate Commission proposes amending its rules of practice (39CFR Part 3001) by providing for expedited proceedings on certain requestsby the United States Postal Service (``Postal Service'' or ``Service'')for changes in rates for its Express Mail service. The proposed new provisionsaim to allow rapid responses to changes in the market for expedited deliveryservices in order to avoid the possibility of unduly hindering competitionbetween Express Mail and similar, nonregulated services provided by othercarriers, while preserving the procedural rights of rate-case participantsas required by 39 U.S.C. 3624.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Section 3624(a) requires that participants be given anopportunity for hearing on the record as provided by the AdministrativeProcedure Act (5 U.S.C. 556-557). Within this general framework, section3624(b) directs the Commission to achieve ``utmost expedition consistentwith procedural fairness to the parties.'' The proposed rules would be experimental in character, and would be subjectto a five-year sunset provision. In addition to rules governing the conductof expedited Express Mail cases, the proposal includes additional periodicdata reporting requirements designed to facilitate completion of thesecases within the planned schedule. The Commission initiated this rulemaking in response to a petition fromthe Postal Service, which included a draft of suggested rules. Those provisionswould, among other things, have established a 90-day schedule for decision(30 days if no hearings were found necessary), placed on intervenors the burden of showing that substantial fact issues required hearing, and (arguably)limited the scope of issues that could be addressed. The Service offeredtestimony of three witnesses to support certain propositions about themarket for expedited services. In general, the Service's position as developedin the testimony has been that the expedited delivery market is highlycompetitive; that price is the most important determinant of competitivesuccess; and that Express Mail is as fully subject to this price competitionas any rival product. The competitive policy the Service wishes to followenvisions price reductions where needed to maintain (or minimize reductionsin) the contribution of Express Mail to institutional costs.\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The Service's suggested rules do not allow for price increaseproposals. As of the last omnibus rate case, decided in March 1988, therevenue target for Express Mail was 169% of its attributable costs (<T3>i.e., </T3>a ``cost coverage'' of 169). A number of parties, including competitors of Express Mail, filed comments.The Commission's Office of the Consumer Advocate (OCA) and the staff ofthe Federal Trade Commission offered alternative suggestions; AmericanNewspaper Publishers Association suggested expanding the type of case tobe considered under expedited rules (also discussed in more detail below).A. Scope of This Rulemaking The Postal Service petitioned the Commission to initiate this rulemakingto consider whether to establish new procedures for expeditiously consideringrequests to adjust Express Mail  rates between omnibus rate cases whencertain developments have occurred in the market. The Commission, in theexercise of its discretion, agreed to consider the Service's presentation.It is clear that whether or not to enact new procedural regulations isentirely within the Commission's authority. Section 3603 of the PostalReorganization Act provides that the Commission may promulgate rules andestablish procedures, consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act,which enable it to carry out its functions and obligations under the Act.``Such rules, regulations, procedures, and actions shall not be subjectto any change or supervision by the Postal Service.'' Thus, the Commissionhas been granted authority to implement whatever procedural rules it deemsnecessary to facilitate the performance of its duties. The Postal Service presentation attempted to accomplish two things: First,to make a convincing showing that new procedural rules were warranted,and useful to the Commission in the performance of its duties; and second,to show that it was possible to draft rules that would produce the desiredlevel of expedition while not compromising procedural due process rightsprovided by law. The Postal Service initially provided testimony from witnessesShipman and Kahn arguing that new rules for rapidly processing rate changerequests made necessary by actions of competitors are required if ExpressMail is to remain a viable entrant in the expedited delivery market. Subsequently,the Postal Service filed rebuttal testimony by witness Michelson to buttressits argument that the continued health of Express Mail depended on havingthe ability to react within 90-120 days to changed rates introduced bycompetitors. Tr. 2/55.We do not decide today that this testimony has shown conclusively thatExpress Mail would be likely to be eliminated as an effective service byany particular competitor price changes taking place in the future. However,it is not necessary for us to make such a finding in order to concludethat providing a vehicle for expeditious review of market response ratechange requests is in furtherance of our duties as assigned by the Act.The Postal Service has shown that Express Mail competes to a greater orlesser extent with expedited delivery services offered by firms in theprivate sector, and that the market for expedited delivery services isquite competitive. <T3>See also</T3> PRC Op. R87-1, paras. 5995-6002. In this rulemaking, the Postal Service has requested the Commission toconsider implementing procedures to expedite rate requests designed toreact to changes in the expedited delivery market_such as competitor'sprice cuts. The Postal Service petition limited the application of theseprocedures to cases in which it proposes reducing Express Mail rates forthe purpose of preserving, to the extent feasible, the level of ExpressMail contribution to institutional costs found appropriate in the mostrecent omnibus rate case. We have analyzed the material concerning theposition of Express Mail in the expedited delivery market provided by thePostal Service in support of its petition. This evidence was not challengedby other participants. We conclude that, to the extent that we can fashionprocedures to review rapidly rate change requests designed to respond todevelopments in this competitive market, those procedures will, in fact,be consistent with our obligations as prescribed in the Act. 39 U.S.C.3624 provides that the Commission may adopt procedures to facilitate conductingcases ``with the utmost expedition consistent with procedural fairnessto the parties''. In addition to providing evidence in support of its request that the Commissionfashion rules to conduct Express Mail market response rate cases with theutmost expedition, the Postal Service presented suggested procedural ruleswhich it thought would meet this test. The development of the suggestedrules, and the rationales underlying particular aspects of these ruleswere not discussed in testimony. This fact did not in any way detract fromthe seriousness of the consideration given to these suggestions, althougha more detailed explanation for some of the specific suggestions mighthave aided our efforts. Postal Service responded to Presiding CommissionerInformation Requests and discovery requests from participants concerningthese rules. We are satisfied that they were fully understood and thoroughlybriefed by interested parties.\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Whether procedural rules adequately protect due processrights is fundamentally a legal question more appropriate for legal memorandaand briefs than for expert testimony. Our review of the rules suggested by the Postal Service leads us to concludethat in several important respects these rules are not acceptable. Ouranalysis of these problems is set out in some length in the sections thatfollow. The deficiencies in the rules suggested by the Postal Service are not inherentin procedures to expedite limited rate requests such as Express Mail marketresponse cases. Although we find ourselves unable to adopt the proceduralsuggestions made by the Postal Service in its petition, the set of rulesput forward by the OCA or the suggestions of the staff of the Bureau ofEconomics of the Federal Trade Commission, we can continue to attempt todevelop rules to expedite such cases which satisfy legitimate due processconcerns. Therefore, we have prepared for comment proposed rules of practicefor use in Express Mail market response rate request cases. Those rulesare set forth in the final section of this notice, along with the invitationfor interested persons to comment on the proposed rules within 40 days.The proposal we are publishing herewith has the same goal of accommodatingregulatory proceedings to claimed market exigencies, and accomplishes approximatelythe same degree of expedition as suggested by the Postal Service, but withoutunduly limiting the issues that may be considered, or the procedural rightsof participants (particularly with regard to discovery), or inappropriatelyshifting burdens of proof. In part, expedition would be achieved throughadditional periodic reporting of relevant Postal Service data, which wouldmake available from the beginning of an expedited case_or in many instancesprior to its filing_much of the fundamental quantitative information neededto try it. The rules we propose today are subject to a sunset provision; that is,they will expire in five years unless we reissue them. Our decision topropose these rules as experimental provisions rests on two conclusions:1. While indicative of probabilities, the record in this case does notestablish with certainty that the degree of expedition contemplated isin fact required by market circumstances; and 2. Decision of a contested rate proceeding, even limited to one class ofmail, in approximately 90 days is likely to be a difficult undertakingand_once it is attempted_these rules should be re-examined.

Procedural History </ITAG>On April 29, 1988, the Postal Service filed a petition requesting the Commissionto begin a rulemaking to establish a modified procedure for adjusting ratesfor Express Mail in periods between omnibus rate cases. The Postal Servicesaid that it needed the ability to respond quickly to changes in the market.Along with the petition, the Postal Service filed suggested language forrule changes and supporting testimony. George A. Shipman (USPS-T-1) discussedthe expedited delivery market and the Postal Service's disadvantages causedby delay in implementing rate changes. Alfred E. Kahn (USPS-T-2) discussedhow the rules would facilitate promotion of economic efficiency and permitthe Postal Service to remain in the expedited delivery market. On May 6, 1988, the Commission issued Order No. 784 (53 FR 16885-86 (May12, 1988)) which provided notice of the Postal Service's filing and invitedcomments on the desirability of instituting a rulemaking. Persons werealso invited to notify the Commission if they wished their names on a servicelist for this rulemaking. The Commission issued Order No. 790 on June 16,1988 (53 FR 23776 (June 24, 1988)). It instituted this rulemaking to considerboth the underlying situation which led to the Postal Service request,and the specific suggestion presented by the Postal Service. The Orderdirected that Stephen A. Gold, as Director of the Office of the ConsumerAdvocate (OCA), participate in the proceeding in accordance with the responsibilitiesunder 39 CFR 3002.7 and Part 3002, Appendix A.On June 21, 1988, the Commission held a conference to discuss the proceduresto be used in this proceeding. In addition to the Postal Service and theOCA, representatives of United Parcel Service (UPS), Federal Express Corporation(Federal Express), Direct Marketing Association, Inc. (DMA), Magazine PublishersAssociation (MPA), Harte-Hanks Direct Marketing/Southern California (Harte-Hanks)and Time Incorporated (Time Inc.) attended. In addition to these parties,Air Courier Conference of America (ACCA), American Newspaper PublishersAssociation (ANPA), American Postal Workers Union AFL-CIO (APWU), AmericanRetail Federation (ARF) and the staff of the Bureau of Economics of theFederal Trade Commission (Bureau Staff) asked that their names be includedon the service list. Presiding Commissioner's Ruling No. 1, issued July 11, 1988, set up theprocedures to be used in this case. Discovery concerning the Postal Service'spresentation was permitted, and the Postal Service was asked to file amemorandum providing further explanation of its suggestion. Because theparties found that they could obtain sufficient information through writtendiscovery, the scheduled appearances of the Postal Service's witnesseswere cancelled at the request of the parties. The OCA and the Bureau Stafffiled alternative proposals. The parties were given an opportunity to investigate these alternativesand to address them prior to the briefing period. At the request of thePostal Service, the procedural schedule was modified to permit it to filerebuttal testimony. A hearing on the testimony of Robert E. Michelson (USPS-RT-1)was held on December 16, 1988. After the filing of initial briefs on January9, 1989, and reply briefs on January 19, 1989, oral argument was held onJanuary 25, 1989. The Postal Service has presented considerable information on the need foran expedited method of changing Express Mail rates to respond to changesin the market. We have decided to propose rules for that purpose, witha view to adopting them for a trial period to see if they can bring aboutthe benefits cited by the Postal Service. While the Service's suggestionshave been of great significance in the development of these rules, we emphasizethat this notice represents our current view of the best way to achievethe objective. The Postal Service's suggested rules do not comport, inseveral respects, with the requirements of our Act and due process standards.Similarly, the suggestions of the OCA and the Bureau Staff do not adequatelyadvance the goal of speed and preservation of consistency with the statute.We have drafted, for public comment, rules which are intended to strikethe correct balance between the Postal Service's need for expedition andthe requirements imposed by the statute. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Description of the Postal Service Presentation </ITAG>The Postal Service explains that its requested rule changes deal only withrequests to change Express Mail rates in the period between omnibus ratecases. These requests would have the purpose of preserving its contributionto institutional costs when the competitive market experiences changes.The Postal Service anticipates changes in the market, but is unable topredict their timing or specific nature. The Postal Service says that theexpedited delivery market is too volatile for Express Mail to compete effectivelyif rates are only changed in the 3-year postal rate cycle of recent years.According to the Postal Service, if an expedited delivery firm cannot meetcompetitors' price changes, it will lose significant business. Postal ServicePetition at 5. Under the Postal Service's suggested rules, the rates requested in thesecases could not be below the average per-piece attributable cost for ExpressMail as found in the most recent omnibus rate case or as determined bythe Postal Service for the most recent fiscal year for which the informationis available, whichever is higher. The rates proposed could not be abovethose adopted by the Governors in the most recent rate case. There are a number of distinctive facets to the Postal Service's suggestedrules for accelerated Express Mail rate changes including: reduced PostalService filing requirements, means for automatic intervention, requiredshowings to obtain a trial-type hearing, and compressed procedural schedules.<T3>Information requirements. </T3>Under the Postal Service's suggestedrules, the usual filing requirements of rule 54 (39 CFR 3001.54) wouldnot apply. Rather, the Postal Service would have to file only informationspecified in its suggested rules. It would provide an explanation of whythe requested rates are a reasonable response to the change in the market,a statement of Express Mail attributable costs, its revenues for the mostrecent four quarters for which the information is available, audited financialstatements, workpapers, and a description of the change in the market whichthe Postal Service wishes to meet. <T3>Automatic intervention. </T3>The Postal Service suggests a number ofinnovations to reduce the time necessary at the initial stage of the case.Interested persons could have their names put on a register kept by theCommission, and they would automatically be made parties whenever the PostalService filed an Express Mail interim rate request under the rules. ThePostal Service would deliver a copy of its filing to everyone on the listwhen it filed a request with the Commission. Another feature of the automatic intervention which the Postal Servicesuggests is a concomitant requirement of supplying certain evidence. IfPostal Service states its rate request is a response to an action takenby a registrant, that party would have to file a sworn statement admittingor denying that it is charging the rates that the Postal Service has citedin its request to change Express Mail rates. <T3>Limitations on opportunity for hearing. </T3>The Postal Service's suggestedrules would limit the availability of a trial-type hearing as well as restrictthe issues which could be raised in it. Parties would have 10 days fromthe Postal Service's filing to request a hearing. The Postal Service wouldlimit the issues that could be raised to (1) the costs have not been calculatedin accordance with the methods from the last rate case, (2) the changein the market cited by the Postal Service has not, in fact, occurred, or(3) the proposed rates are not a reasonable response to that change. PostalService Suggested Rule 3001.57b(4). In a request for a hearing, the party would have to state which of thePostal Service's assertions it disagrees with, and describe the facts itbelieves to be true. Additionally, the party would name the witnesses itproposes to present and summarize their testimony. The Commission wouldthen decide whether a genuine issue of material fact had been raised forwhich a hearing was necessary.<T3>Time schedules. </T3>The Postal Service's suggested rules include thetime periods for each stage. Rule 3001.57b(5)(e) would provide that theCommission may shorten any of the time limits, but will not extend anyof them. If no hearing were to be held, the Commission would issue itsdecision within 30 days of the filing of the request. If a hearing wereheld, it would be scheduled to begin no later than 20 days after the filingof the request. Testimony from parties would be submitted within 30 daysof the Postal Service's filing, with hearings starting 15 days later. Rebuttaltestimony would be due 5 days after the conclusion of hearings on parties'direct testimony, with hearings on rebuttal beginning in another 5 days.Briefs would be filed 10 days after the hearings were finished and replybriefs in another 10 days. The Postal Service suggestion would give theCommission 10 days after the filing of the reply briefs to issue its decision.<T3>Items not addressed. </T3>The text of the Postal Service's rules donot address a number of items involved in our proceedings. The suggestedrules are silent concerning procedural steps when the Commission determinesit is not required to hold a hearing. The Commission's decision is to beissued 20 days after the deadline for a party to request a hearing. Itis not clear whether those rules contemplate the filing of briefs and replybriefs, and how those steps_and the Commission's issuing a decision_couldbe fit into those 20 days. Another matter not addressed by the Postal Service's rules is interventionby a person not on the list for the automatic process. Often, the Commissiongives interested parties 30 days from the time notice appears in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>to intervene. Under the Postal Service's suggestion,in cases not requiring a hearing, the Commission would issue its decisionwithin 30 days of the Postal Service's request. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Analysis of the Postal Service's Presentation </ITAG>A. The Potential Need for Expedition in Express Mail Market Response RateRequests Warrants Development of Procedural Rules for These Cases Federal Express and UPS assert that the Postal Service has failed to provethat a need exists for specialized rules for accelerated considerationof rate changes for Express Mail. Federal Express argues that the existingprocedural rules have never been tested with regard to how much expeditionis possible. Federal Express Brief at 20. UPS agrees that the Postal Serviceshould not be given a rule change until it has shown that the current proceduresare inadequate. This showing would be done by its filing a request forExpress Mail rate changes and asking for expeditious consideration. UPSBrief at 26. UPS points out that the Commission decides myriad-issue ratecases in 10 months. Therefore, a limited-issue Express Mail interim ratechange case could be expected to take much less time. UPS Reply Brief at3-4. According to UPS, there are a number of methods currently availableto the Postal Service that it could use to speed consideration of a raterequest without amending the Commission's rules_including undertaking toprovide all relevant data in its request and to respond fully and promptlyto discovery. UPS Brief at 26. The Postal Service points to its testimony in this proceeding and assertsthat it has proved the need for an expedited method of changing ExpressMail rates to meet developments in the market. The Postal Service statesthat previous losses of Express Mail volume and revenue are due to competitors'changes in the market to which it could not respond because they were introducedafter the completion of an omnibus rate case. Postal Service Brief at 1.ANPA accepts the premise of a possible need for the Postal Service to beable to make reasonably rapid changes in response to market conditionsin order to preserve contribution to institutional costs. ANPA Brief at3. The Postal Service's presentation in this case is sufficient to persuadeus to attempt to fashion a set of procedural rules to help expedite ExpressMail rate changes_at least for a trial period. These rules would be usedto speed consideration of Express Mail rate requests made in the limitedcircumstances described by the Postal Service, while preserving the rightsof interested parties in accordance with the Act. While expedition in considering limited rate change requests is certainlypossible without amending our rules, we believe that the procedures weare fashioning will be helpful. We have seen that in dealing with casesof first impression, much time can be spent at the initial stages in discussionsconcerning how best to proceed. Another source of controversy is oftenthe informational and other filing requirements. If, as we are attemptingto do here, rules can give the Postal Service and interested parties advancenotice of what is expected of them and how the Commission intends to proceed,the expedition that always remains the Commission's goal can be furthered.Our willingness to modify our rules of practice to accommodate the PostalService's request for as much expedition as is consistent with the Actand due process is in accordance with our role in regulating rates. TheSupreme Court has stated: ``Regulatory agencies do not establish rulesof conduct to last forever; they are supposed, within the limits of thelaw and of fair and prudent administration, to adapt their rules and practicesto the Nation's needs in a volatile, changing economy. They are neitherrequired nor supposed to regulate the present and the future within theinflexible limits of yesterday.'' <T3>American Trucking Associations, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Atchison, Topeka andamp; Santa Fe Railway, </T3>387 U.S. 397, 416 (1967).We believe that it may very well be possible to devise rules to expediteconsideration of these unique cases the Postal Service may need to filein the future. No party has shown why developing procedures to speed ourprocess must be deferred until time has been expended discussing such mattersin the midst of an actual case. Although a review of how accelerated processeshave worked will be important after a case is decided under these rules,and the insight gained from actual experience may tell us much more thanwe can determine in this rulemaking, we believe it best to do what we canat this point to make expedition possible. This approach is wiser than trying to develop procedures after such a requestis filed. Items such as filing requirements must be resolved before a casebegins; and time spent on developing procedures during a case is time takenfrom analyzing issues raised by the actual request. We realize that onlyexperience with actual cases can show how well such rules are able to work.Therefore, we are setting a date when these rules will expire unless theyare renewed following a public notice of proposed rulemaking. As the Postal Service has made a reasonable, if not conclusive, case forthe need for expedition once it decides market forces indicate change isrequired, it seems reasonable to define procedures now in order that thecase may be accelerated as much as possible once it is filed. In particular,we are trying to compress the initial stages to the extent consistent withdue process concerns. Automatic intervention and service can give partiesa ``head start'' in their review of the Postal Service's request. Similarly,regular data filing requirements can permit the Commission and partiesto do their analysis more quickly, because they can be familiar with importanttrends and relevant background material.The potential benefits of affording the Postal Service a means of expeditingrate changes when the market indicates such action may be called for ifExpress Mail is to remain a viable service, making a significant per-piececontribution to institutional costs, have been demonstrated on our record.<T3>E.g.,</T3> USPS-T-2 at 22-24. Witness Shipman describes the recentexperience of the market with the competitors' actions to attract expediteddelivery business.<T3> E.g.,</T3> USPS-T-1 at 17-18. Witness Kahn finds the expedited deliverymarket to be highly competitive, with firms competing vigorously_activelyvarying their prices and quality to attract customers. USPS-T-2 at 15-16.B. Restricting Procedural Rules to Use with Express Mail Does Not Violatethe Statutory Directive Forbidding Undue Discrimination Some of the parties contend that adopting rules for use only with ExpressMail would be impermissibly discriminatory. For the reasons explained indetail below, we believe that it is appropriate to establish new proceduralrules only for Express Mail at this time. The record before us has beendeveloped adequately only in regard to Express Mail and the rule changeswe are proposing are designed specifically to meet the requirements forconsidering an Express Mail rate request described by the Postal Servicein this proceeding.Federal Express, UPS and the OCA\4\<NOTE/> state that adopting expedited procedures for only one classof mail raises questions concerning violation of section 403(c) of theAct. Section 403(c) states that ``the Postal Service shall not, exceptas specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or unreasonablediscrimination among users of the mails, nor shall it grant any undue orunreasonable preferences to any such user.'' <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Federal Express Brief at 21; UPS Brief at 14-16; OCA Briefat 11-12. We first turn to the generalized argument that providing the benefit ofthese rules to only one class of mail_in this case, Express Mail_raisesquestions of violation of the discrimination prohibition of section 403(c).The argument has some appeal as a call for equal treatment of the mailclasses, but it is not persuasive. In supporting its suggestion to limitthe rules, the Postal Service points out that the other parties have notshown that all classes of mail face the same type of competitive situationas Express Mail. Postal Service Reply Brief at 10. ANPA states that it might be appropriate to permit the consideration ofspecific Express Mail rate proposals under expedited proceedings. ANPABrief at 3. According to ANPA, the evidence on the record indicates a needfor speed in changing Express Mail rates in certain circumstances; theanticipated effects of possible changes on the other classes of mail are  minimal. ANPA urges that cases heard under such expedited proceduresmust be limited as the Postal Service has suggested: that is, rate changessolely to help retain Express Mail's contribution to institutional costsin the face of changes in the market brought about by competitors.<T3> Id.</T3> at 3-5. The Act prohibits only ``undue or unreasonable discrimination.'' Differingtreatment of the various mail classes is contemplated by the statutoryscheme.<T3> See</T3> 39 U.S.C. 3622-23. In the<T3> NESS</T3> case,\5\<NOTE/> the court explained that section 403(c) requires that a reasonedjustification be given for differential treatment of the classes of mail.Restricting the application of expedited rules of procedure to one classat this time meets the dictates of section 403(c), as Express Mail is theonly class for which evidence supporting such rules has been given. Dynamicmarket conditions with direct competition for a   class that makes a relativelylarge institutional cost contribution per piece_circumstances which havenot been shown to exist for other classes_are expected to prevail.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ National Easter Seal Society for Crippled Children andAdults v. United States Postal Service, 656 F.2d 754, 760-62 (DC Cir. 1981).The record is sufficient to support a presumption that_in light of thelimited impact on other classes and subclasses of mail_Express Mail interimrate changes could reasonably be considered in a separate, expedited ratecase. With regard to some of the other mail classes, our record does notshow how rate changes to respond to as yet unspecified market changes couldbe reasonably considered outside a case where the impact of proposed ratechanges on other classes and subclasses of mail can be considered. Ratechanges for some classes and subclasses could have direct and indirectimpacts which affect the Postal Service's finances to such an extent thatthe appropriate revenue contribution of each of the classes must be subjectto litigation in the proceeding. That a similar expedited procedure cannot be provided for all classes doesnot require its rejection, without a trial period, for the one class wherethere is reason to believe that it may be appropriate. If it later appearsthat similar procedures might be suitable for another class, the Commissionmay extend the applicability of these rules. The Postal Service must also accompany any request under these rules withevidence demonstrating that its proposal meets all the statutory criteriain the Act, including section 3622(b)(3). Therefore, arguments_which wouldbe valid if indeed Express Mail rates making no contribution to institutionalcosts were permitted_that the Postal Service's suggested rules are undulydiscriminatory with respect to those elements have been answered by ourproposed rules which do not suffer from the flaws described by UPS. <T3>See</T3> UPS Brief at 15. C. Our Proposed Rules Anticipate Rates Established With Reference to FutureCosts Strenuous objections were made to the Service's proposal to use as thecost base for an expedited case<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * a statement of the attributable costs by segment and componentfor Express Mail service as determined in the most recent omnibus ratecase and for each fiscal year thereafter for which information is available.</ITAG>Postal Service Suggested andSection; 3001.57a(5). That these historical costdata would determine the rate floor in a rule 57 case is clear from suggestedandSection; 3001.57b(2). By contrast, the Commission's rules for a conventionalrate case require costs for a fiscal year ``beginning not more than 24months subsequent to the filing date'' of the Service's request. 39 CFR3001.54(f)(2). We have determined that rate adjustments in market responserate cases should also reflect rolled-forward test year costs as providedin rule 54(f)(2). One commenter argues that 39 U.S.C. 3621 requires rates to be set on futurecosts, and that the Service's proposal is thus, on its face, unlawful.UPS Initial Brief at 2-5. In addition, UPS contends that by singling outExpress Mail for historical-cost rate treatment the proposed rules wouldlead to violation of the ``undue or unreasonable discrimination'' standardof section 403(c). <T3>Id.</T3> at 15. The Service responds that its proposal is for a differentstyle of rate proceeding, to deal with particularized problems; and thatthe Board of Governors' freedom to choose the timing of rate requests (39U.S.C. 3622(a)) leads to the result that rates are often in effect afterthe expiration of the test year for the proceeding in which they were set.Postal Service Reply Brief at 2-4.While not fully accepting the arguments made on either side, we do thinkUPS has pointed out a significant problem. We do not construe section 3621as absolutely requiring future, rather than historical, costs as a ratemakingbasis. Use of future costs is an accepted regulatory practice,\6\<NOTE/> reflecting the need to synchronize the incidence of ratesand costs. Where rates become effective only after the conclusion of regulatoryproceedings, as is the case under sections 3622 and 3641 of the Act, suchsynchrony calls for a future test period. However, UPS appropriately questionswhether users of one class_whose rates are being adjusted prospectively,just as they would be in an omnibus case_should escape the otherwise applicablerule of synchrony with costs. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>18 CFR 35.13(d) (2)-(4) (Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission rules for electric rate filings) and American Public Power Assoc.v. FPC, 522 F.2d 142 (DC Cir. 1975). The Postal Service's argument that rates set in omnibus cases often outlivethe test year does not really respond to this point. We agree that in ourpractice the Commission chooses a test year that is expected to be representativeof, rather than identical with, the life of the resulting rate schedule.The troublesome question is whether one class of mail, faced with private-sectorcompetition, should in principle\7\<NOTE/> pay rates set on a different basis. The Service argues unequivocallythat they should: <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ We deal below with questions of practicality suggestedby the need for special expedition in these cases.<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * Unlike an omnibus request made to insure that the overall break-evenstandard is satisfied at some specific future point in time, they wouldbe limited, interim rate reductions designed to minimize the loss in contributionto institutional costs from just one class following an unforeseen changein market conditions * * *.</ITAG>Reply Brief at 4. This argument appears to have two bases: (i) The declinein revenue (and thus, presumably, its ultimate effect on other users) willbe small; and (ii) the object of a rule 57 case is not to achieve overallbreakeven but to preserve Express Mail's contribution to institutionalcosts. Accepting both premises arguendo, we do not think either provesthe Service's point. The first point is subject to the objection that, if we assume a general,continued increase in costs,\8\<NOTE/> the impact on mailers as a whole will be still less if webase Express Mail rates on rolled-forward costs. The second is undercutby the recognition that, when rates are set prospectively and the preciseamount of their contribution to institutional costs is of major importance,we cannot fully determine what that contribution will be without at leastapproximately synchronous cost data.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Presumably if the Service expected costs to decline itwould have provided in its proposal for use of a future (lower-cost) testperiod. The comments filed in this proceeding demonstrate that institutional-costcontribution is a principal key to the problem. The Service, in its filingsand through its witnesses, has repeatedly stated that its object is topreserve, as far as it can, the substantial contribution Express Mail nowmakes to institutional costs. Its adversaries have, no less frequently,insisted that_whatever the Service's policy goals_its draft rules wouldpermit it to propose rates barely above attributable cost. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>UPS Brief at 6-8; Tr. 4/449-50; Comments of FederalExpress in Response to Commission Order No. 784 (June 13, 1988) at 11.Institutional cost contribution must reflect, inter alia, a balance betweenPostal Service competitiveness and concern for competitive private-sectorfirms. <T3>See </T3>section 3622(b)(4). While we must use informed judgment inarriving at an appropriate markup for each class (PRC Op. R87-1, paras.4001-21), there is no justification for handicapping ourselves ab initioby allowing the proposed contribution to be the essentially fictitiousresult of dividing expected future revenues by past-period costs. There are, accordingly, two compelling arguments against the Service'shistorical-cost proposal: (i) It is inherently defective as a means ofarriving, prospectively, at accurately cost-based rates, and (ii) insofaras it would tend to facilitate or magnify rate reductions, it would favorusers of the only class to which it would apply over all other users. Whilethese defects, taken alone, might disqualify it, we must recognize thatit is proposed as an expediting mechanism and that expedition is the raisond'eandCx.174;3tre of the proposal as a whole. The Postal Service argues that<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * given the need for a speedy resolution if the rate reductionis to achieve its purpose, it is neither necessary nor practical to repeatthe entire roll-forward process for just one class.</ITAG>Reply Brief at 4. This concern for expedition is quite appropriate; wepart company from the Service, however, when it also assumes that avoidingprotracted controversy over the cost basis in an expedited case justifiesusing historical rather than rolled-forward costs.\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ It is of course not certain that even historical costswould be free of controversy. The Postal Service's own proposal_narrowas it is_would allow parties to challenge the costing method the Servicehas followed in attributing (historical) costs to Express Mail. Suggestedsection 57b(4). In past cases, the Service itself has felt the need to``adjust'' its own cost data judgmentally, <T3>see </T3>PRC Op. R84-1 para. 5310, a procedure that may also give riseto dispute. In addition, the Postal Service has at times introduced innovationsin handling Express Mail, which require changes in the costing (<T3>e.g., </T3>PRC Op. R87-1, paras. 3625-29). We believe expedition can be maintained without abandoning estimated futurecosts for these cases, and so we expect an adequate set of prospectivecosts to be furnished when a case is begun. We are also proposing to amend 39 CFR 3001.102 by adding a subpart, (e)Express Mail Volume Statistics. This new provision would require that thePostal Service file quarterly data on Express Mail pieces and weight, andshould significantly assist in achieving more expeditious treatment ofExpress Mail market response rate proposals. These data on volumes by serviceand rate cell will provide a sound basis for evaluating market trends whena market response rate request is filed. The data will be of public recordas soon as received, and those expecting to be interested in any marketresponse case may generally familiarize themselves with the data aheadof time. Obscurities can be elucidated informally outside the formalitiesand time constraints of a section 3622 proceeding. It should thus be possibleto dispense with many otherwise-necessary discovery questions and relatedmotions practice. In this way, participants in a market response rate casecan concentrate to a greater extent on substantive rate issues, ratherthan on developing a record on historical volumes (or other quantitativedata insofar as volumes affect them). D. The Postal Service's Procedural Suggestions Fail to Protect AdequatelyParties' Statutory Due Process Rights <ITAG tagnum="81">1. The Notice Provision in the Postal Service's Suggested Rules isNot Sufficient to Give Adequate Notice of a Request for Change in ExpressMail Rates </ITAG>UPS argues that the Postal Service's proposal violates the due processrequirement of providing notice to interested persons. UPS points out that,if someone relied on seeing a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice rather than signing the list for automaticservice and intervention, the 10-day period to ask for a hearing wouldprobably have passed before notice was actually received. UPS Brief at24-25. The Postal Service responds that most interested parties would receiveactual notice because they would be on the Commission's list. Accordingto the Postal Service, the Commission could extend the deadline if a partyoffered good cause. Postal Service Reply Brief at 12-13.The innovative procedure the Postal Service developed_allowing interestedpersons to register with the Commission and automatically receive noticeand intervenor status_is useful, but in and of itself does not provide adequate notice to the public. The suggested rules assume that every personlikely to be affected by a proposed Express Mail rate change would pre-registerwith the Commission. Particularly in light of the dynamic nature of themarket, future rate requests may affect customers and providers of relatedbusinesses who previously were not concerned with Express Mail issues.These parties should be afforded the opportunity to participate meaningfullyin proceedings that they believe will affect their interests. It is unreasonable to expect all entities who might conceivably be affectedby one or another Express Mail rate requests to pre-register with the Commission.Therefore, the notice provided in the Postal Service suggested rules isso inadequate as to be unreasonable as an exclusive procedure. Personswho had not thought to pre-register to participate in future Express Mailmarket response rate cases would have to rely on <T4>Federal Register </T4>notification. The time consumed by the publicationof the notice, the filing of the notice to intervene, and then obtaininga copy of the request would significantly diminish the ability of thoseparties to participate in a case whose accelerated schedule had been setwith the expectation that every participant had a complete copy of therequest and supporting evidence on the day it was filed with the Commission.During the latter stages of Phase I of this proceeding, and especiallyduring the testimony of Postal Service witness Michelson, it was suggestedthat the Commission or the Presiding Officer could waive provisions ofthe rules should they be found to be working an unreasonable hardship onthe public. While it is true that in special circumstances rules can bewaived, this fact does not support the adoption of unreasonable rules.Our procedural rules are intended as an effective guide to what is expectedof participants. Promulgating unreasonable rules would discourage publicparticipation and might even be the basis for collateral attack on Commissionaction taken under such rules. There is a further problem with this procedure as initially suggested bythe Postal Service. The Service would require each party registered withthe Commission to provide information on its rates if the Postal Serviceidentified those rates as the reason for a market response rate requestfiling. It appears that some competitors believe that at least some oftheir pricing practices are trade secrets. <T3>E.g., </T3>Federal Express answer to Postal Service interrogatory 4(Docket No. R87-1). We do not want to include a provision in these proceduralrules which would discourage interested parties from being included onthe list. We also note that no similar scheme has been cited in this rulemaking,and we have serious doubts as to its consistency with the AdministrativeProcedure Act. A more balanced procedure will be possible through the useof discovery rather than  mandatory filing requirements. Postal Servicemay file interrogatories or requests for admission seeking clarificationof the pricing practices of any party. Use of discovery will provide promptinformation for the record while preserving the opportunity to interjectany valid privilege claims. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. The Postal Service, as Proponent of the Change, Retains the Burdenof Proof; Parties Must be Allowed to Raise Any Relevant and Material Issuesof Fact </ITAG>ACCA, Federal Express, OCA and UPS all argue that the Postal Service'ssuggested allocation of burden of proof violates due process. Accordingto the OCA, the Postal Service, as the proponent of a rate change, hasthe burden of presenting a prima facie case that its request is consistentwith the Act. OCA argues that the rules suggested by the Service incorporatesuch narrow evidentiary requirements that they relieve the Postal Serviceof this burden. The burden of going forward with evidence would then fall_improperly_toopponents of the change.\10\<NOTE/> Federal Express emphasizes that the Postal Service's suggestionwould not even require  it to demonstrate that the change in the marketsparking its request would actually have a serious negative effect on ExpressMail. Federal Express Brief at 3-4. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ OCA Response to Memorandum of the USPS, 4-6, (August15, 1988). The Postal Service argues that the Administrative Procedure Act permitsthe shifting of the burden of going forward with the evidence from theproponent of a rule to those opposing it. Postal Service Brief at 24. ThePostal Service says that its suggested rules would create a rebuttablepresumption it could rely on as making its <T3>prima facie </T3>case. <T3>Id. </T3>at 25. Regulatory developments allowing more pricing freedomfor regulated entities and increasing the difficulty involved in challengesare cited. <T3>Id. </T3>at 26-28. According to the Postal Service, its showings thata change had occurred in the market and that its request is a reasonableresponse would be sufficient to meet the demands of the APA. Postal ServiceReply Brief at 14. The Postal Service adds that it is not necessary tore-litigate in interim rate change cases issues, such as Express Mail elasticity,which can be expected to be litigated in every omnibus rate case. <T3>Id. </T3>at 15-17. Burden of proof in the contemplated cases has two aspects: What the PostalService has to present to support its case and what other parties haveto present in requesting a hearing. <T3>Postal Service required presentation. </T3>Turning first to the issueof the Postal Service's presentation, the Postal Service's suggestion doesnot make clear what is included in the required showing that its request``is a reasonable response to the change in the market,'' Postal ServiceSuggested andSection; 3001.57a(3). If the showing of reasonable responseencompasses all the strictures of the Act, what the Postal Service suggestsis not so very different from what the intervenors demand, or what is specifiedin the rules we have fashioned. Our proposed rules, presented for publiccomment in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, make it clear that the PostalService has the affirmative obligation to provide evidence showing thatits request is consistent with the Act. We accept the Postal Service's assertions about a general trend towardgreater pricing flexibility for firms subject to regulation.\11\<NOTE/> We are charged, however, to follow the dictates of the ratemakingprovisions of the Postal Reorganization Act. Within the confines of thatlaw, we will cooperate with the Postal Service in attempting to move thesecases forward as quickly as is consistent with the requirements of dueprocess. Nonetheless, the Service has the burden of showing that requestedrate changes are consistent with the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ It should be noted, however, that such initiatives arelikely to accompany efforts to eliminate monopoly positions held by theregulated firms_a feature not, of course, present here.In this regard we take specific note of the statement by Postal Servicecounsel, Tr. 2/94-95, that the Service believes it will not have to showthe elastic nature of Express Mail in future market response rate requestcases because that issue will have been settled by its presentation inthis docket. Such is not the case. While the Service may choose to relyon recently submitted evidence from other cases, central facts such asthe likely reaction of customers to price changes cannot be deemed settledfor all time. Markets, service offerings, and customer perceptions change;and the Commission must recognize changes when they occur.\12\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ We also believe it appropriate to point out that we donot find any specific point elasticity for Express Mail in this case.<T3>Limitation of issues.</T3> Associated with the due process concernsof a right to a hearing and burden of proof, is the Postal Service's suggestionto limit the issues permitted to be raised to: (1) The consistency of costcalculation with the methods used by the Commission in the last omnibusrate case, (2) the authenticity of the purported change in the market,and (3) the reasonableness of the Postal Service's proposed response. Apparentlyany other issue would be resolved by reference to the most recent omnibusrate case. ACCA, Federal Express and UPS strongly oppose this suggestion. FederalExpress argues that the Commission does not have the statutory authorityto limit the issues otherwise made relevant by the Act. Federal ExpressBrief at    15. UPS points out that important issues, such as elasticity,may not fall within a category for which the Postal Service's suggestionwould permit a hearing. UPS Brief at 22. The Postal Service states thatthe Commission would be acting reasonably in deciding that issues addressedin the most recent omnibus rate case could be foreclosed from re-litigationin interim Express Mail market response rate cases. Postal Service Briefat 23. We find that parties should be permitted to request a hearing for any genuineissue of relevant and material fact regarding any of the policies set forthin the Act. If a party can identify such an issue and requests a hearingafter the Postal Service has filed a request for a change, due process,and section 3624, require that a hearing be granted. The discussion ofsuch an issue in the previous omnibus rate case, however, may help to expediteits consideration. <T3>Compare</T3> PRC Op. R87-1, paras. 5901-02. With regard to the Postal Service's suggestion that parties be precludedfrom re-litigating issues addressed in the last rate case, it has failedto show us how that action could be consistent with the Act. In dealingwith Express Mail interim rate cases_or any request under the Act_the Commissionand the parties are not dealing with a blank slate. Indeed, many referencesto the last rate case are to be expected_as well as some reliance on thedata and decisions found there. <T3>Compare</T3> PRC Op. R87-1, App. J, CS IX; PRC Op. R87-1, paras. 5995-6040.There are a number of issues that regularly are addressed with referenceto the disposition found in the previous case_often an omnibus rate case,but sometimes a more limited classification case. <T3>E.g.,</T3> PRC Op. R87-1, paras. 3587-621. In particular, the Commissiontreatment of costing methods is similar in some respects to the PostalService's rebuttable presumption suggestion. After adopting a costing methodin one case, it has been the Commission's practice to retain it in subsequentcases absent a persuasive, affirmative showing that it should be changed.This practice speeds the proceedings and encourages advances in postalcosting. We also note that ANPA argues that the costs used in interim ExpressMail rate cases should be based upon the attribution principles from thelast omnibus rate case. ANPA Brief at 10. The combination of the reliance on established costing methods and theaddition of new requirements for Postal Service periodic Express Mail datafilings will foster the expedition that the Postal Service would pursuethrough its use of rebuttable presumptions to narrow the area of permissibleinquiry. <T3>See </T3>Postal Service Brief at 20-26. We can foresee situations inwhich costing issues should be revisited in an interim rate case, as forexample, if a processing or transportation feature has been modified. Thedifference, however, is that the Commission would not foreclose the considerationof issues which appeared in the most recent omnibus rate case. When the Postal Service re-opens the subject of Express Mail by filinga rate request, the interested parties must be given the opportunity toaddress any genuine issues of material fact. As only a limited number ofissues will be present_compared to an omnibus rate case_we expect, withthe Postal Service's co-operation, that they may be addressed with dispatch.Issues in addition to those involved in costing, such as the appropriatecontribution to institutional costs, are also regularly addressed in Commissionproceedings in ways which explicitly take into account their dispositionin previous rate cases. This reliance on what has been learned before canbe used to speed the cases contemplated by the Postal Service without anynecessity to resort to cumbersome and elaborate presumptions or foreclosureof further consideration of relevant issues. The difference_an importantone in our view_might be summarized by saying that normal reliance on precedenthelps to provide a <T3>substantive</T3> rule of decision without either forbidding productionor excusing nonproduction of certain evidence by any party. A presumption,on the other hand, defines who must produce what evidence if an issue isto be decided; its applicability therefore has to be determined beforethe case can proceed. Turning a matter ordinarily governed or influencedby precedent into an evidentiary presumption therefore may be counterproductiveso far as expedition is concerned.<T3>Requirements for obtaining a hearing. </T3>Turning to the showing necessaryto obtain a hearing, the Postal Service suggests rules which require thatwithin 10 days of their first opportunity to see the Service's rate request,participants must make an extensive demonstration of the questions of factwhich warrant a hearing. While the Postal Service's presentation in thisrulemaking has focused on the market and the competitors, it will be comingto the Commission with requests to change Express Mail rates. The PostalService is the entity holding most of the information concerning ExpressMail. It would not be proper administrative practice to hold parties tothe compelling need standard suggested by the Postal Service. <T3>Advanced Micro Devices </T3>v. <T3>CAB,\1\\3\</T3><NOTE/> cited by the Postal Service to support its idea of shiftingthe burden of proof, concerns a CAB policy statement describing the circumstancesin which it intended to exercise its statutory discretion to suspend ratechanges and order an inquiry. Parties opposing the changes were not requiredto meet the high evidentiary standards the Postal Service suggests. Rather,the showing needed to trigger a suspension was any showing_such as especiallysteep increases_that could negate the CAB's premise that   competitivemarket forces were regulating the market. 742 F.2d 1534.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ 742 F.2d 1520 (DC Cir. 1984). It is reasonable to ask parties to be as specific as possible in requestinga hearing and describing the issues to be litigated. Furthermore, we donot intend to provide a hearing unless a genuine issue of material factconcerning the Postal Service's request has been identified. <T3>Compare </T3>Order No. 726. However, the Postal Service suggestionthat parties must identify their positions and supporting evidence within10 days of its filing or forfeit the opportunity to question the PostalService in public hearings is patently unreasonable. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Discovery Will Be Available in Express Mail Market Response Cases</ITAG>The Postal Service's suggested rules do not address the subject of discovery.Federal Express complains that the Postal Service's rules do not providean opportunity for discovery, even though the parties would be requiredto make a compelling showing on an issue subject to litigation in orderto obtain a hearing. Federal Express Brief at 13. In its reply brief, thePostal Service states that discovery would not be denied, since the Commission'sregular rules of practice (with the exception of the information requirementsof rule 54) are to apply except as otherwise stated. <T3>See</T3> Postal Service Reply Brief at 18. We note that under the PostalService's suggested rules hearings on the Service's direct case would begin20 days after a request is filed, while answers to discovery requests underthe Commission's regular discovery deadlines (39 CFR 3001.26(b)) are alsodue in 20 days. Under these circumstances discovery would be of littleor no benefit to parties in their preparation for cross-examination ofPostal Service witnesses. We have found discovery very helpful in narrowing and defining issues aswell as clearing up ambiguities. Cross-examination is more effective whenthere has been an opportunity to receive answers to preliminary writtenqueries. Our experience shows that discovery also can hasten proceedingssignificantly. Discovery permits the hearings to move much more quicklyand can sometimes be a substitute for them. In this rulemaking, for example,the parties who had requested the appearance of the Postal Service's directwitnesses for oral examination, withdrew these requests after the PostalService filed answers to interrogatories. We conclude that meaningful opportunity for discovery on the Postal Serviceis an important means for facilitating effective participation by intervenors.Additionally, in these cases where we wish to co-operate with the PostalService in its desire to move the proceedings forward as quickly as possible,discovery can play a very important role in accelerating considerationof Express Mail rate requests. We believe, therefore, that it is appropriateto assure an opportunity for meaningful discovery in rules for expeditedconsideration of these requests.\1\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ Our proposed rules make specific provision for discoveryon an accelerated schedule. The answers are to be filed in 10 days, ratherthan the 20 usually given. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Rules the Commission Adopts Must Appear to Be Workable in an ActualCase </ITAG>ACCA, Federal Express and the OCA state that the Commission could not actuallyconsider a case using the procedural rules suggested by the Postal Service.Federal Express points to the suggested rule 57b(5)(e), which states thatthe Commission will not extend any of the time limits established in therules for these cases, and contrasts that unambiguous language with witnessMichelson's statement that, in some circumstances, the Postal Service mightnot object to an extension of time. Federal Express Brief at 12-13. TheOCA states that promulgating a set of rules that even a representativeof its proponent believes might not be followed would be poor administrativepractice, perhaps in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. OCABrief at 8-10. ACCA says that the suggested limitation of issues, takenwith Postal Service Michelson's assurance that the Commission could consideradditional ones, would make for ``chaotic, unpredictable proceedings.''ACCA Brief at 13. In its reply brief, the Postal Service states that it has consistentlyheld the position that the Commission would retain its authority to extenda deadline if necessary. Postal Service Reply Brief at 14. The Postal Serviceargues that in all foreseeable cases, the Commission could consider requestsusing the suggested rules. If an unanticipated situation arose, the Commissioncould modify the rules. <T3>Id. </T3>at 22. Having considered the rules which the Postal Service suggested, we agreewith the opponents who state that it would be impossible to adhere to themwhile protecting the due process rights of interested parties. We believethat rules can be fashioned which provide a much more realistic frameworkto consider market response rate requests on an expedited schedule. Inestablishing rules of procedure, it is best to begin with schedules thatappear workable. Thus we are publishing for comment proposed rules whichwe believe to be both fair and realistic. We are not including a provisionsimilar to the Postal Service's that no deadline may be extended. The PostalService acknowledges that situations may arise such that due process demandscould be satisfied only by extending the very tight deadlines suggested.In cases under the accelerated rules, we intend to put parties on notice,however, that a request for extension of time will not be looked on withfavor and should be accompanied by a full explanation of why it is thoughtto be necessary.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Consideration of Express Mail Rates in Expedited Proceedings WillNot Substitute for Rate Case Review </ITAG>In its brief, ANPA expresses the concern that cumulative Express Mail ratechanges under the suggested rules could have an unforeseen effect on postalfinances and the other classes of mail. ANPA states that it is importantto review periodically all the classes of mail in one proceeding_the omnibusrate cases. ANPA Brief at 3. During oral argument, UPS warned that, ifthe Postal Service's rules were adopted and rates were set under them,the Postal Service might decide not to include Express Mail in omnibusrate cases. According to UPS, the court's decision in the <T3>Dow Jones </T3>case \15\<NOTE/> might preclude the Commission from making a legal recommendationconcerning Express Mail rates in an omnibus rate case if the Postal Servicechose not to request consideration of them in its request. Tr. 4/454-55.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Dow Jones andamp; Company v. United States Postal Service,656 F.2d 786 (DC Cir. 1981). The situation described by UPS would make us hesitant to adopt rules foraccelerated proceedings if we found it likely to be an accurate prediction.However, we do not read <T3>Dow Jones </T3>to say that the Commission may not recommend rate changesfor a type of mail that the Postal Service has omitted from its requestinitiating an omnibus rate case. The situation in <T3>Dow Jones </T3>dealt with a case begun under the classification sectionof the statute_3623, rather than the section applicable to rate changes_3622. It is clear that the Commission may not initiate a rate case under section3622. But the Commission's jurisdiction in omnibus rate cases, initiatedby the Postal Service, extends to all domestic mail classes. The Courtin <T3>Time, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Postal Service </T3>addressed the Commission's statutory mandate inomnibus rate cases. The court explained that the recommended rates shouldreflect the Commission's carefully considered judgment of the appropriateinterrelationship among the various classes and subclasses of mail_takinginto account the evidence presented and the factors set out in section3622(b).\16\<NOTE/> In the past, the Commission has recommended rate changesfor a class which the Postal Service had not included in its request. <T3>See </T3>PRC Op. R80-1, paras. 1126-35. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ 685 F.2d 760, 771-72 (2d Cir. 1982). We anticipate that the Postal Service will explicitly include Express Mailrates for review and possible modification in each omnibus rate case; butin any event, we believe that the Commission must consider all classesin any such case, and may include valid Express Mail rates in its recommendeddecision. There have been instances in omnibus rate cases where the Commissionrelied on decisions made in recently completed classification cases anddid not change rates for the type of mail that had been involved in the previous case. <T3>E.g. </T3>Docket Nos. MC83-2 and R84-1 (Zip + 4 discount). We note,however, the parties in the subsequent rate case were given the opportunityto present evidence concerning the appropriate amount for the discountwhich had just been adopted. The situation feared by UPS_consideration of Express Mail rates only inaccelerated proceedings_is not a plausible hypothesis. Such a situationwould, indeed, be contrary to the Postal Service's stated intent in requestingmodified rules, and our purpose in fashioning rules to meet the needs describedin this rulemaking. Further, both the Service's suggestions, and the rulesthe Commission is proposing, tie rate changes to findings in the previousomnibus rate case, thereby requiring that Express Mail costs and ratesbe the subject of such findings. Finally, through proposing a sunset provision,we are undertaking to reconsider our rules. If there is any sign that theyare being used to avoid consideration of Express Mail in omnibus rate cases,that fact would be a serious argument in favor of abolishing rules foraccelerated consideration of these requests. <ITAG tagnum="85">V. The Staff of the Bureau of Economics of the Federal Trade CommissionSuggestion </ITAG>A. Introduction and Summary On October 14, 1988, the staff of the Bureau of Economics of the FederalTrade Commission filed an alternative to the Postal Service's suggestedrule changes.\17\<NOTE/> The Bureau Staff suggests that the Postal Service be givena ``zone of discretion'' in pricing Express Mail. The lower bound of thiszone would be rates equal to Express Mail's attributable cost after adjustmentsmade for what the Bureau Staff believes are subsidies to the Postal Service.The upper bound would be the rates adopted in the most recent omnibus ratecase. In return for this pricing flexibility, the Postal Service wouldpermit competitors in the expedited delivery market more freedom by relaxingits regulations governing permissible pricing by competitors_issued inaccordance with its discretion given by the Private Express Statutes. Inthe Bureau Staff's view, the Postal Service is disadvantaged by rate inflexibilitycaused by regulation, while private firms are disadvantaged by minimumrate restrictions and subsidies to the Postal Service. Bureau Staff Briefat 5.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ Brief, in the Form of Comments, of the Staff of the Bureauof Economics of the Federal Trade Commission.The Bureau Staff's comments provide a useful theoretical approach to thiscompetitive market. Much of the analysis and reasoning which it has presentedis helpful in considering the goals which should be pursued with regardto pricing in the expedited delivery market. However, as explained in greaterdetail below, this alternative has not been shown to comport with actualpricing practice or  statutory requirements. The Bureau Staff recognizedthat the Commission might not be able to implement this change under currentlaw when it acknowledged that establishing the zone of pricing discretionin the rate making process might ``require the PRC to seek additional legislativeauthority.'' Bureau Staff Brief at 17, fn. 43. The Bureau Staff has presenteda model for all-inclusive reform in this market, which would require statutoryamendments. In this rulemaking, however, we are focusing on changes whichcan be made at this time under our present statutory authority and mightassist in promoting efficient functioning in the market under the conditionswhich currently prevail. B. Details of the Staff of the Bureau of Economics of the Federal TradeCommission Proposal The Bureau Staff supports greater pricing freedom for both the Postal Serviceand the competitors in the expedited delivery market. Bureau Staff Briefat 3-4. The Postal Service has some authority over the activity of itscompetitors in the market in light of its authority under the Private ExpressStatutes to either prohibit or regulate the commercial carriage of letters\18\<NOTE/> without the payment of postage. The Postal Service has establisheda number of  exceptions that expedited delivery firms may use _ and indeedare using _ to compete for the business of carrying letters. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ The general definition of ``letter'' for purposes ofthe Private Express Statutes is a message directed to a specific personor address and recorded in or on a tangible object. 39 CFR 310.1(a). Currently, under the suspension for ``extremely urgent'' letters, privatecompetitors are permitted to carry letters which would otherwise be subjectto the restrictions of the Private Express Statutes. Without this suspension,with private commercial carriage over post roads, postage would also haveto be paid to the Postal Service. The Postal Service's regulation statesthat it will presume letters are extremely urgent if the amount paid tothe private carrier is the greater of $3 or double the applicable First-Classpostage, including the Priority Mail rates. 39 CFR 320.6. With regard to competitors' flexibility in pricing, the Bureau Staff arguesthat the ``cost test'' for the Postal Service's suspension of the PrivateExpress Statutes is set too high.

Commission Analysis of This Presentation <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Introduction. </ITAG>We will not follow the suggestion of the staff of the Bureau of Economicsof the Federal Trade Commission to tie the provision of rules to accelerateconsideration of these Express Mail rate requests to action by the PostalService reducing constraints on the market caused by its administrationof the Private Express Statutes. The record does not support any findingthat the Postal Service is so restricting the ability of the other firmsto compete in the expedited delivery market through use of the PrivateExpress Statutes that it should not be given even the potential to changeits rates more quickly in response to developments in the market. Consistentwith our decision in Docket No. R87-1, however, in recommending rates underthe proposed rules, we will take into account the effect on the marketthat the Postal Service's action might be causing. See PRC Op. R87-1, para.6029. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. The Record Does Not Show Postal Service Actions Have Had a SeriousAnti-Competitive Effect on the Expedited Delivery Market </ITAG>In Docket No. R87-1, ACCA raised this issue, and asked that the PostalService's request for increased Priority Mail rates and decreased ExpressMail rates be denied until it modified its double postage test and so eliminatedthe anti-competitive harm it was causing private firms. ACCA, however,presented no evidence tending to show any effect on the market. TakingACCA's argument and other factors into account, the Commission reducedthe potential for competitive harm from the double postage test by holdingPriority Mail rates constant and setting Express Mail rates to meet thedouble postage test where practicable. PRC Op. R87-1, paras. 6029-30. In this proceeding, we have additional information on the effect of thedouble postage rule on the expedited delivery market, and we do not findevidence of much actual constraint on the competitors' pricing. In dealingwith this issue, one must always remember that the Private Express Statutesapply only to letters. The Postal Service has no authority over any othermaterial that a customer might want delivered. Comparing the discountedFederal Express and the UPS Next Day Air rate schedules filed in this proceeding(USPS-LR-1) to doubled Priority Mail rates_in all zones_the discountedFederal Express rates were lower for 30% of the rate cells and the UPSrates were lower for 58% of the rate cells. The Bureau Staff's premisethat the double postage rule is, in fact, controlling the rate settingof the competitors is, therefore, shown to be incorrect. Additionally,from the information filed in Docket No. R87-1, it appears that the BureauStaff's concerns that the Postal Service's advantages might result in theprivate firms' inability to compete in the expedited delivery market isnot supported by the trends showing increased volume carried by competitors.PRC Op. R87-1, para. 5997. The evidence available in this record also indicates that the Postal Serviceis not using its enforcement of the Private Express Statutes as a ``pricesqueeze'' to divert volume from competitors to Express Mail. ACCA citedthe reports of enforcement filed as USPS-LR-2 as evidence of anti-competitiveeffects. ACCA Brief at 5. However, ACCA does not point to any instancein which the sender transferred business to Express Mail. Although thetheoretical argument remains sound, considerably more evidence would berequired to demonstrate that the potential  for actual harm is so greatthat the drastic remedy suggested is necessary. ACCA and other interestedparties will be free to raise this issue, and submit any additional supportingevidence that should be taken into account in setting rates, when an actualcase is brought under the proposed rules. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. The Record Does Not Support the Inclusion of Amounts to RepresentAdvantages to the Postal Service When Determining Express Mail AttributableCosts for Ratemaking </ITAG>In accordance with our prior decision, we are not persuaded by the argumentthat additions should be made to the attributable costs of Express Mailin setting rates to reflect advantages not available to competitors. Ithas been our consistent interpretation of the statute that the attributablecosts used in ratemaking are those which we expect to occur. PRC Op. R83-1,paras. 6028-37. The factors that the Bureau Staff believes should be reflectedin the rates are appropriately taken into account, if at all, as part ofthe consideration in setting the cost coverage. These issues will be addressed,as appropriate, in dealing with specific requests for rate changes.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Office of the Consumer Advocate Presentations </ITAG>A. Description of Office of the Consumer Advocate Suggested Rules The OCA, believing that smaller rate and classification cases should haveaccelerated procedural rules available, offered a set of procedural rulesthat it thought the Commission should adopt in place of those suggestedby the Postal Service. Rather than the demands of the market, on whichthe Postal Service bases its request for accelerated rules, the OCA arguesthat the availability of the rules should turn, in the first instance,on the significance of the new rate or classification for the Postal Service'sfinances. The OCA believes that the less significant types of requestswould most likely be appropriate for expedited treatment. OCA Brief at4. Noting that the Commission rules used in considering previous interimrate requests do provide some opportunity for streamlining the procedure,the OCA argues they are incomplete in not including any indication of whenthat action is appropriate. OCA Brief at 17. The OCA asserts that the greateravailability of its suggested procedures makes them superior to the PostalService's. <T3>Id. </T3>at 14. Under the OCA's suggestion, any request that would result in a change ofless than 1% of the Postal Service's aggregate revenue would be eligiblefor consideration under procedures requiring a decision within 150 daysof the filing. The OCA's suggestion is based on the procedural rules wefashioned to consider Postal Service proposals for experimental changesin rates and classifications. OCA Brief. at 13. The OCA suggestion calls for the parties' filing, at the earliest possibletime, statements identifying what they believe to be the issues of genuine,material fact. The Commission would use these statements in ordering thelimitation of issues at trial-type hearings. Under the OCA's suggestion,as in our proposed rules, the Postal Service would have to meet the regularfiling requirements in the absence of an explanation of the data's unavailabilityand a waiver. If the Postal Service intended to collect data during thetime in which the requested rates were in effect, a complete descriptionof the plan for data collection would be required. OCA Suggested Rulesat 3-6. The OCA suggests that in cases filed under its rules, the Commission have30 days to decide whether the accelerated procedure is appropriate andthen 120 days to issue a decision. In the first 30 days, the Commissionwould have to publish a notice of the filing, permit interested partiesto intervene and address the issue of whether the accelerated rules areappropriate, give the Postal Service an opportunity to respond to any oppositionto proceeding under the rules, determine whether their use is, indeed,appropriate, and issue an order to that effect. In deciding whether to proceed under the OCA's suggested rules, the partiesand ultimately the Commission would consider a number of factors: Novelty,complexity, scope, magnitude, availability of data and its quality, andthe apparent need for expedition. The OCA would permit cases that exceededits financial impact test to be considered under its suggested rules whenextraordinary circumstances, which it does not define, were present. <T3>See </T3>OCA Brief at 15. B. Positions of the Parties No other party in this rulemaking supports the OCA suggestion. A primaryobjection is the assertion of lack of notice. Several parties state thatthe Commission's notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>initiating this rulemaking was not adequate forthe adoption of procedural rules concerning classes other than ExpressMail, since parties interested in other classes would not have had anyindication that the pertinent procedures might be modified. <T3>E.g., </T3>Federal Express Brief at 17. The Postal Service adds that proceedings under the OCA's suggestion wouldtake too long because of the longer deadline for decision and the requirementthat it file all of the data called for by current rule 54 unless specificallywaived. Postal Service Brief at 30. The Postal Service points out thatthe OCA provides no guidance regarding which cases should be consideredunder its suggested rules. Additionally, the OCA's rules lack a suggestedprocedural schedule demonstrating how the 120 days could be allocated tothe various steps needed to consider a filing. <T3>Id. </T3>at 31. According to the Postal Service, the OCA's suggestionsimply does not address the need for expedited Express Mail rate changes.<T3>Id. </T3>C. The Office of the Consumer Advocate Suggested Rules Are Not Appropriatefor Use With the Type of Case Described on This Record The parties' contention that further notice would be necessary before adoptingthe OCA's suggestion as a final rule is well-founded. However, we haveconsidered the suggested rules on their merits and conclude that they arenot appropriate for our adoption and use. The focus in this rulemakingis whether more expeditious consideration of proposals to change ExpressMail rates may be warranted under certain circumstances, and whether thatgoal could be accomplished while protecting the due process rights of interestedparties. The rules for experiments are not a good model. With a generic rule forexperiments, an initial period in which parties may challenge the characteristicof ``experimentality'' can be said to be a necessity_regardless of whetherit is specifically provided for in the rules. Because of the nature ofexperiments, it would not be possible to establish, in advance, all theidentifying characteristics making the rules for considering an experimentappropriate. With the situation we have before us regarding the PostalService's stated intentions concerning Express Mail, we can foresee thetype of cases which will be filed. If the Postal Service adheres to thedescription it has given us, we may proceed with our consideration of thefiling without an initial round of litigation to determine whether to usethe proposed rules. When fashioning rules for expedition, it is importantto make as many determinations as possible before the request is filedand to make the identification of the cases to be considered under thoserules as noncontroversial as possible. A wide diversity of cases could arguably meet the OCA's threshold testof minor impact. Thus it is likely that the Commission would be faced withdeciding within 30 days whether a particular request met the broad five-parttest OCA offers to identify ``minor'' cases. We believe that establishinga set of rules of practice with so little idea of when they might be usedwould not be good administrative practice. Only when necessary should timebe taken up litigating which set of rules should be used to consider afiling. OCA proposes its alternative rules in part because it considersrules applicable to only one class unduly discriminatory. We have rejectedthat argument previously in this decision.The Postal Service requests the most expeditious proceedings possible forchanges in Express Mail rates to react to developments in the market. Webelieve it best to tailor our accelerated procedures to the cases expectedto be filed. In trying to design rules of more general application, theOCA's suggestion fails to develop procedures which will be most usefulin expediting the market response cases Postal Service expects to file.For this reason, OCA's proposal does not satisfy our goals in this rulemaking.D. The Office of the Consumer Advocate Alternative Suggestion is Not AppropriateWhen More Guidance Can Be Given the Postal Service and Interested PartiesIn its reply brief, the OCA states that, if the Commission decides notto adopt the OCA's suggested rules, it should issue a policy statementconcerning its intention to expedite Postal Service requests for ExpressMail rate changes filed for the purpose of meeting developments in themarket. The OCA explains that this alternative would notify interestedparties of the Commission's plans to accelerate consideration of marketresponse rate cases without adopting rules which might be unjustified orpremature.\22\<NOTE/> OCA Reply Brief at 8-9. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ The OCA argues that the problems pointed out with regardto the Postal Service's suggested rules are such that they must be rejected.OCA Reply Brief at 8. We are not accepting this alternative suggestion. We believe that it isbetter to establish rules, at least for a trial period, in advance of thefiling of the type of case   contemplated by the Postal Service. As explainedpreviously in this decision, expedition can be best promoted by settlingas many procedural matters beforehand as possible. Some of the specific provisions of our proposed rules are definite improvementsover the policy statement proposed by the OCA. Our adoption, with modifications,of the Postal Service's idea for automatic intervention and concurrentservice of the request is designed to reduce the time the parties willneed to familiarize themselves with the details of the filing. Similarly,our requirement that the Postal Service make periodic filings of ExpressMail data should facilitate analysis of the issues in requests made ata later time. Since we are able to set up specific procedures to give the parties andthe Postal Service a more complete idea of what will be expected of themin a market response rate case, it is better to do so. This course is preferableto litigating the procedures for speeding a request while simultaneouslytrying to determine its merits. In this manner, the means for promotingexpedition may be given a more realistic test. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. American Newspaper Publishers Association's Suggestion That ExpressMail Complaint Proceedings Be Considered Under Expedited Rules Can NotBe Adopted on This Record </ITAG><T3>Description.</T3> In its brief, ANPA states that the Commission shouldalso provide rules for the expedited consideration of complaints that ExpressMail is failing to cover its costs if it adopts rules for expedited considerationof Postal Service requests for Express Mail rate changes. ANPA Brief at11. It is not entirely clear whether the complaints to be considered underexpedited procedures could include those involving assertions merely thatExpress Mail is not making an appropriate contribution to institutionalcosts, rather than challenges that Express Mail is not covering its attributablecosts. <T3>See id.</T3> at 11-12. ANPA considers its suggestion to be a matterof fairness, as well as a method of furthering the goal for which the PostalService filed the petition considered here -preserving Express Mail's contributionto institutional costs. <T3>Id.</T3> <T3>Commission analysis.</T3> We are not adopting the ANPA suggestion atthis time. In this proceeding, we have been told that the Postal Servicecontemplates the filing of particular cases for which it would like special,expedited rules of procedure. There has been no indication that the Commissionwill be faced in the foreseeable future with the type of complaint ANPAhypothesizes. While we cannot predict the frequency with which the Servicemight file market response cases, it is reasonable to suppose that ExpressMail's covering of its attributable costs may be tested_in these casesand in omnibus rate cases_comparatively often; this more frequent reviewwould reduce the likelihood that an interested party would have to resortto initiating complaint proceedings. ANPA did not elaborate on the specifics of expedited procedures for suchcomplaint cases. There are considerable differences between rate changerequests and rate complaints, particularly as to access to the underlyingfacts which the two separate proponents (the Postal Service and privatecompetitors) of the changes would have. Therefore, we do not believe thatany type of ``mirror image'' set of rules for complaints would, in fact,be fair to the complainant. In a complaint, we would expect that the partybringing the case would require a longer time for discovery against thePostal Service than is necessary in market response rate cases, where thePostal Service will be able to file all necessary supporting testimonyat the beginning of the case. We too are concerned with assuring that after a market response rate adjustment,Express Mail continues to recover its costs and make a contribution toinstitutional costs. The requirements for periodic filing of Express Maildata will provide an on-going opportunity for both the Commission and interestedparties to assess the status of that class. We think this requirement willbe of more value to these parties than setting up expedited proceduresfor cases whose dimensions and issues are currently unknown. <T3>Opportunity to re-visit issue.</T3> The rules we are proposing areto be experimental, and we are committed to review them in 5 years. Atthat time, or earlier if serious problems concerning complaint cases arise,we can re-consider whether some specific procedures for expediting complaintcases concerning Express Mail rates should be established. It is not appropriatenow to set up procedures for such cases. We have no information on thelikelihood of such complaints being filed at all, and our record does notsupport a good estimate of the scope of issues that might be involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Commission's Proposed Rules for Use in Express Mail Market ResponseCases </ITAG>A. The Benefit of Establishing Procedures To Expedite Market Response CasesHas Been Shown This notice of proposed rulemaking offers for public comment proceduralrules which would govern requests for, and conduct of, Express Mail marketresponse rate requests. These rules provide that in limited circumstancesa Postal Service rate change request shall be considered subject to theseprocedures, which provide for the most expeditious review of a rate changerequest. As discussed in detail above, this case was initiated by a Postal Servicerequest that the Commission consider the adoption of special rules of practicefor use in considering market response rate requests. While we have foundthat the specific rules suggested by the Postal Service were flawed, thegoal of developing procedural rules which will enable the Postal Serviceto respond in a timely fashion to changes in the market for expedited deliveryservices is worthwhile. Several intervenors, while objecting to the specificproposals put forward by the Service, expressed their view that the Commissioncould process a limited rate request as expeditiously as necessary to providemeaningful relief should the Postal Service be faced with a situation inwhich prompt rate adjustments were necessary. ANPA Brief at 3; OCA Briefat 3; UPS Brief at 26. In our opinion, establishing in advance filing rules and hearing procedureswhich can be used to expedite the conduct of such a rate request shouldbe beneficial. Having filing requirements and a procedural schedule setin advance will free participants from the need to prepare pleadings andattend preliminary conferences to formalize these matters. In particular,developing filing requirements now should reduce expenditures of time andenergy on disputes relating to the adequacy of documentation supportinga market response rate request, and allow participants to move directlyto analyzing the potential impact of any Postal Service request of thisnature. The rules proposed herein provide for the development of an evidentiaryrecord, and the analysis of that record, in a highly compressed time period.Under these rules, it will be possible to proceed from request to decisionwithin the 90-day time period requested by the Postal Service. The Commission fully recognizes that a 90-day rate case will put strainon participants, the Postal Service and the Commission itself. We presentfor comment the procedures set forth herein, with the expectation thatthey would enable the Postal Service and interested participants to developa complete evidentiary record, and assuming the good faith efforts of allparticipants, allow us sufficient time so that it will be possible to hearand decide on market response rate requests within this limited time. This notice of proposed rulemaking should elicit additional thoughts frominterested persons on the feasibility of these rules. B. Incorporating a ``Sunset'' Provision Will Assure Thorough Review ofthe Practical Effects of These Rules A feature not suggested by any participant, but in our view necessitatedby the record in the docket and the novelty of the concept underlying theService's proposal, is the ``sunset'' provision. We include it not onlyto make clear that we will be interested in suggestions for improvementin these rules, but also to emphasize their experimental character. In offering opportunities for hearing in this docket, we went beyond thestrict procedural requirements for promulgation of rules of practice.\23\<NOTE/> We followed this course primarily because the Service's petitionrested on certain factual premises apparently susceptible of confirmation,if not absolute proof, through the hearing process: That Express Mail existsin a generally competitive market, that price is a main factor for competitivesuccess in that market, and that Express Mail is fully subject to thisprinciple. The Postal Service also implicitly treated these questions asmatters of fact; it volunteered the direct testimony of Dr. Kahn and Mr.Shipman, and later offered Mr. Michelson's rebuttal testimony.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ The Commission has customarily not taken advantage ofthe language in 5 U.S.C. 553(b) exempting rules of practice from the notice-and-commentrequirement. In this docket we have gone a step farther, inviting not onlycomments but production and examination of witnesses. Nonetheless, the issuance of amended procedural rules remains in our reasonably-exerciseddiscretion. This fact is significant here because it allows us, with appropriatesafeguards, to issue expedited rules <T3>not because we find the associated factual premises unequivocally established,but because we think (i) there is a substantial chance they are   trueand (ii) the risk of ignoring them is greater than the risk entailed byexperimenting with new rules. </T3>If the Postal Service has shown a sufficientprobability (even though far short of certainty) that its premises aretrue, and the public benefits to be expected from a viable Express Mailservice are adequate, the procedural difficulties that may be caused bynovel and highly expedited procedures do not seem an excessive price.We think this approach is most appropriate since we see no absolute necessityfor establishing the above-stated premises as facts in the same sense that,for example, certain cost premises must be established in order to recommendrates in a section 3622 case. A set of procedural rules does not in itselfimpose consequences, favorable or otherwise, on the Service or other interestedparties. The decision whether to establish a specialized set of proceduralrules, therefore, may appropriately turn on the existence of a substantiallikelihood of their being needed. Conceivably, this problem could be approached by arguing that_taking forgranted that continuance of Express Mail service is beneficial_the existenceof <T3>any </T3>probability, however minute, that nonexpedited rate-case treatmentcould lead to its decline or extinction should require creation of expeditedrules. This approach is simple, but unsatisfactory because it ignores bothcertain real costs\24\<NOTE/> and the possibly unquantifiable but nonetheless mandatoryinterests of ratemaking under a regime of administrative due process. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ It is not unlikely that litigating and deciding a caseon an extremely compressed schedule will impose extra costs on all concerned,including the Commission. These may be as straightforward as the need toschedule overtime for clerical workers or as diffuse as losses in efficiencyor sales caused by a less-than-fully refined analysis of some complex problempresented by the case. On the other hand, we do not consider it appropriate to require that theService demonstrate, in effect, that it could always substantially prevailin an expedited case before we will consider creating rules allowing forsuch cases. Our experimental approach attempts to avoid the pitfalls onboth sides. As proposed, these rules will cease to be effective after five years ifthe Commission does not act to reissue them. This assures that questionsconcerning weaknesses in the rules themselves or inequities in the impactof their operation will have to be addressed prior to the expiration ofthe five-year period. Five years is suggested as a reasonable length oftime for the Commission and interested participants to experience the impactof these rules and evaluate whether and what adjustments might be necessary.C. Details of Commission's Proposed Rules Introduction. The rules presented for public comment in this Notice ofProposed Rulemaking contain several important differences from the rulesproposed by the Postal Service in its request which initiated this docket.These changes are largely designed to overcome the serious problems identifiedby participants in the first phase of this rulemaking, and discussed inthe previous section of this opinion. The format of these rules follows the basic outline of the specific proposalpresented by the Postal Service. There was nothing inherently improperin the organization of the new rules suggested by the Service, and by castingthe Commission's draft rules in this outline we expect to facilitate publicunderstanding of what these proposed rules would accomplish, and of thedifferences between our proposal and the one initially offered by the PostalService. Throughout, the rules are described as applicable to Market Response RateRequests. The rules as proposed would only apply to Express Mail MarketResponse Rate Requests, but if these rules effectively facilitate PostalService responses to changes in the market for Express Mail, and a needarises to allow for Market Response Rate Requests in other classes of mail,expanding the applicability of these rules could be considered. Section 3001.57_Purpose and Duration of Rules. This introductory section serves two purposes. First, it describes thelimited circumstances under which the Commission would utilize these specialprocedures for considering a Postal Service rate request. Second, the proposalcontains a self-enforcing ``sunset'' provision. The Postal Service initially requested rules of this nature in order toenable it to respond promptly to changes in the market for expedited deliveryservices_a market which it considers both highly competitive and highlyvolatile. It presented evidence indicating that Express Mail was competingin the expedited delivery market with other closely substitutable services,and that providers of these substitute services had in the past implementedchanges in rate design, rate levels, or service options, and that futurechanges of this nature would be likely to attract a significant amountof business away from Express Mail. Postal Service indicated that rulesfor market response rate cases would only be used to respond to a changein the market for expedited delivery services. This restriction was writteninto the first section of the rules proposed by the Postal Service. In support of its proposal, the Postal Service promised that it would onlypropose rate changes under these expedited rules for the explicit purposeof preventing or minimizing the erosion of contribution from Express Mailto institutional costs which would occur if the Service failed to respondto a competitor initiated change in the expedited delivery market. USPS-T-1at 1-2. The rules presented for public comment today specifically incorporate bothof these circumstances as prerequisites to a Postal Service rate requestpresented for consideration under these rules of practice. Section 3001.57states that these sections apply only when the proposed changes ``are intendedto respond to a change in the market for expedited delivery services forthe purpose of preserving the Express Mail contribution to institutionalcosts recommended in the most recent omnibus rate case.'' Since the PostalService has stated it requests authority for expeditious rules to be usedonly in such a case, it is proper to specify the limited circumstanceswhen these procedures would be appropriate in the rules themselves. Makingthese explicit prerequisites may promote expedition by reducing controversyover whether any particular rate request qualifies for consideration underthese procedures. This provision adds the further clarification that theserules cannot be used while an omnibus rate case is pending. The second important aspect of proposed rule 57 is that it contains a sunsetprovision. By its own terms, this rule would be effective for only fiveyears. During that time the Commission would review the experience gainedin cases brought under these rules to determine whether the rules in factpreserve the proper balance between the need for prompt responses in acompetitive market and the need for an adequate opportunity to analyzeand comment on Postal Service proposals for changing mail rates.If during this initial period, it should appear that the market for expediteddelivery services has changed by becoming less volatile or competitive,or that the position of Express Mail in that market has become less subjectto erosion from alternative services, then the need for procedures forcingextraordinary expedition in reviewing market response rate requests maybe less acute. On the other side of the equation, the ability of interestedparties to participate in market response rate request cases, and the abilityof the Commission to fulfill its statutory obligations in cases handledwith the extreme emphasis on expedition contained in these rules, can betterbe assessed after actual experience. Additionally, improvements and changesto remedy problem areas can be drafted with more precision after the Commissionand the parties have had actual experience with the operation of theseprocedures. Section 3001.57a_Data Filing Requirements One of the areas of concern stressed by parties commenting on the rulesproposed by the Postal Service was the limited amount of information tobe provided by the Postal Service in support of its request. The PostalService suggested that in market response rate request cases the focusof inquiry should be on whether a change has occurred in the market forexpedited delivery services, and on whether the rates proposed by the PostalService are a reasonable response to that change. The comments we received in the first phase of this case correctly emphasizethat the statutory criteria applicable to postal rates must be appliedeven when the proposed rate changes are designed to respond to a changein a particular market or sub-market. With this principle in mind, theproposed rules published today balance the benefits of allowing the PostalService to file and litigate a request promptly and without unnecessarypreliminary data collection, with the need for an evidentiary record adequateto evaluate any rate request made by the Service. The initial Postal Service proposal would have made the Commission's ruleswhich set forth the information which should be provided in support ofnormal rate change requests inapplicable to market response rate requests.The Postal Service never explained why compliance with any particular requirementwithin these rules would be particularly onerous. We understand that the Service may wish to act quickly to meet competitivechallenges. Nonetheless, we are confident that Postal Service managementwill attempt to craft reasoned responses to such challenges, and will gatherand review relevant and material information prior to proposing rate adjustments.There is no <T3>a priori </T3>reason why such information, and the analysis that leadsmanagement to conclude that a particular proposal is a proper responseto a change in the expedited delivery market, should not be provided tothe Commission when such a request is filed. It appears that the most appropriate way to proceed is to retain the requirementsof rule 54, at least insofar as requiring information on the subclassesand services for which the Postal Service requests rate changes. Thus,if the Service were to request only changes in Express Mail rates, thenonly data and information on Express Mail need be provided. Postal Service is familiar with the scope of rule 54, and maintains regulardata collection systems which produce the vast majority of the requiredinformation. If information required by rule 54 is not available, and cannotbe readily developed, the rule allows for a waiver as is permissible underour current rules of practice, subject to a statement of explanation beingprovided. <T3>See </T3>rule 54(a)(2). It seems clear that when information relevantand material to a proposed rate change is available, that information shouldbe provided with the request. This is particularly true in the contextof a market response rate request, which is to be handled in the most expeditiousfashion possible. In other respects the data filing requirements suggested in this Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking are largely similar to those presented by the PostalService. In several specifics, however, more detailed information is requiredto be filed with the Postal Service request so that the scope and purposeof the request can be more clearly understood at the outset. Proposed rule 57a(7) directs the Postal Service to describe the changein the market for expedited delivery services to which its proposal isresponding, how that change is likely to affect the market, and how thePostal Service proposal will meet that competitive challenge. Further,rule 57a(8) requires the Postal Service to provide its analysis showingthat its proposal is consistent with the applicable statutory ratemakingcriteria, and that it will avoid or minimize losses in the Express Mailcontribution to institutional costs. Other benefits of the proposed rule include clarification of the methodologieswhich the Postal Service may use in developing its cost and volume estimates,and the requirement that potential changes in the Postal Service operatingrules, as described in the Domestic Mail Manual, are to be described tothe parties. Section 3001.57b_Expedition of Public Notice and Procedural ScheduleThis portion of the proposed rules sets forth those procedures which canenable the Commission to proceed from the filing of a request to the issuanceof a recommended decision within 90 days. When the Postal Service proposedprocedures for hearing cases with the utmost expedition, it included aninnovative method to notify members of the public known to be interestedin changes in Express Mail rates. The Service suggested that the Commissionmaintain a list of persons indicating a desire to receive immediate noticeof Express Mail market response rate requests, and that the Postal Servicewould make immediate service on all persons on that list whenever sucha rate request is filed. We shall adopt this proposal. Additionally, we suggest several other innovationsdesigned to reduce the time needed to provide adequate public notice. Wealso suggest new means for expediting the hearing process, should publichearings be required to resolve issues of fact involved in a market responserate request. Postal Service expressed its willingness to serve its request by hand onregistrants maintaining an address for service within the Washington metropolitanarea, and for serving other addresses by expedited delivery service. Inaddition to this requirement, we believe that the Postal Service shouldalso send a notice briefly describing its proposal to all participantsin the most recent omnibus rate case. That notice would clearly state thatit was a notice of an Express Mail market response rate request, and wouldidentify the last day for filing a notice of intervention with the Commission.The rules proposed by the Postal Service allowed members of the publiconly 10 days to request a hearing following a Postal Service request, andrequired the Commission to issue its recommended decision within 30 daysif no request for a hearing was granted. Commenters in the first phaseof this docket correctly argued that 10 days was not an adequate opportunityfor affected persons to make their views known. This is particularly truesince it is easy to conceive of circumstances in which previously unaffectedbusinesses or individuals could be significantly affected by a market responserate change. Since it is not reasonable to assume that all potentiallyaffected persons would preregister with the Commission, 10 days does notprovide adequate notice for all interested parties to express a desireto be heard. Further, the Postal Service proposal did not allow an adequateopportunity for briefing legal and policy issues. Today's proposed rules allow 28 days for parties to indicate a desire forevidentiary hearings. This schedule allows for publication in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>in addition to the written notice to be providedby the Postal Service to parties in the previous rate case. Another unacceptable aspect of the rules proposed by the Postal Serviceas part of its request for expedited market response rate cases was a proceduraltimetable that assured that discovery on the Postal Service would not generateinformation usable in intervenors' evidentiary presentations. This wasthe result of two proposed requirements: First, that interested partieshad to describe the contents of their evidentiary presentations within10 days of the Postal Service filing its request; second, that any intervenortestimony had to be filed no later than 30 days after the Postal Servicesubmitted its request. Again, as discussed above, commenters objected andwe found these complaints well grounded. The rules proposed in this notice include a new rule applicable to discoveryin market response rate requests, rule 57c(5)(d). This provision allowsfor discovery as soon as a market response rate request is filed, withanswers to such requests due within 10 days. To reduce potential delayfrom motion practice, objections to discovery requests in market responserate cases are to be made in the form of a Motion to Excuse From Answering,with service on the questioning participant by hand, facsimile or expediteddelivery. Answers to such motions must be made within seven days, and theCommission foresees prompt Presiding Officer Rulings on all such motions.As a result of this rule, interested participants should be able to receiveresponses to an initial round of discovery prior to determining whetherit is necessary to request an evidentiary hearing. In past Commission dockets,parties have successfully dealt with similar, tight discovery timetables,particularly near the scheduled conclusion of hearings in 10-month ratecases; <T3>and see </T3>Presiding Officer's Ruling No. MC86-1/5 and PresidingOfficer's Ruling of June 27, 1983 (Docket No. MC83-2). In the most recent omnibus rate case, Docket No. R87-1, intervenors agreedto respond to discovery requests in 14 days in order that additional timewould be available to prepare direct evidentiary presentations. This proposedrule would require answers in only 10 days, which could become difficultfor the Postal Service, should it receive a large number of discovery requestssimultaneously. However, the Service is the primary advocate for completingmarket response rate request cases in 90 days, and as such, it should bewilling to commit the resources necessary to answer intervenor questionsas completely and expeditiously as possible. A procedural schedule for hearings in market response rate cases is alsoset out in the proposed rules. By specifying the procedural schedule, therules provide participants with notice of when evidence will be due andwhen hearings will be held, which should help parties to plan witness availabilityand resource allocation. The proposed rules do make it clear, however,that the dates prescribed are subject to adjustment by the Presiding Officer.To further facilitate discussion of schedule adjustments, the rules alsospecify two considerations which will be central to requests for additionaltime: whether the requesting participant has exercised due diligence, andwhether the Postal Service has unreasonably delayed participants from fullyunderstanding the ramifications of its rate request. The hearing schedule initially proposed by the Postal Service was flawedin several important respects. Intervenors had to request hearings within10 days, and those hearings were to begin on the twentieth day after thePostal Service filed its request. That schedule would prevent participantsfrom using written discovery to clarify and narrow issues. The hearing schedule contained in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking isset out in rule 3001.57b(5)(e). It allows interested persons 28 days torequest an evidentiary hearing and schedules hearings on the Postal Servicerequest to begin 35 days after the filing. As a result, intervenors shouldbe able to utilize discovery to shorten the length of time needed for oralcross-examination of Postal Service witnesses. Intervenor testimony isto be filed 49 days after the Postal Service submits a market responserate request. Postal Service suggested that only 30 days be allowed toprepare and submit intervenor testimony. Again, the additional time forpreparation should allow the incorporation of discovery responses in intervenortestimony.This schedule reflects the expectation that market response rate requestswill not involve numerous new issues or novel complex technical analyses.As generally described by the Postal Service, these cases would involvethe Postal Service proposing a rate adjustment to counter changes in themarket made by its competitors. Such a case would seem to focus on themarket or submarket affected, and the likely reaction of customers. Assuminga straight forward request in these circumstances, the scope of testimonyshould be rather narrow, and the schedule does not allot additional timefor testimony in response to intervenor presentations.\25\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ Rule 3001.57b(5)(f) specifically allows for rebuttalpresentations, should any party support a request for an additional opportunityto be heard. The delay caused by adjusting the schedule to allow rebuttalshould be minor. Initial briefs are scheduled for the 70th day after Postal Service filesits direct case, approximately the same time that briefs would be due underthe schedule proposed by the Postal Service. <T3>Section 3001.57c_Rule for Decision.</T3>This brief provision incorporates the rule for decision suggested by thePostal Service in its initial submission, that Commission decisions willbe in accord with the statutory requirements contained in the Postal ReorganizationAct. Additional language has been added to reiterate that the purpose ofthese proposed rules is to provide the most expeditious consideration possiblefor market response rate requests, consistent with the procedural due processrights of interested persons. <T3>Cf.</T3> 39 U.S.C. 3624(b). In its proposed rules, Postal Service establishedarbitrary dates for Commission decisions. Since such arbitrary dates mightconflict with our ability to satisfy statutory obligations, they have beenexcised from the rules proposed today. There is no dispute that statutoryobligations take precedence over procedural dates established by Commissionrulemaking. Nonetheless, it should be clear that the purpose of these  rules is to provide for the most rapid consideration of market responserate requests that is consistent with a careful exploration of the scopeand impact of such requests. Section 3001.102(e)_Express Mail Market Response Volume Statistics. We propose adding to the regular data filing requirements of the PostalService a new section to facilitate the tracking of Express Mail volumeschanges. The explicit assumption underlying the adoption of rules for expeditiousconsideration of Express Mail market response rate requests, is that ExpressMail volumes will vary as a direct result of acts of other participantsin the expedited delivery service market. In order to identify existingmarket trends, and to evaluate changes made in response to competitor initiatives,it will be necessary to have detailed volumes statistics available at theinception of a market response rate case. In discussing its initial proposal, Postal Service implies that rule 57cases will be more likely to focus on adjustments in a limited number ofrate cells, in order to meet specific competitive challenges, than to seekacross-the-board rate reductions. Rule 102(e) will provide the Commissionand the parties with volume trends by quarter, and within certain largevolume rate cells, data indicating shifts in the weight of a typical piece.Having this information on file with the Commission will allow for preliminaryanalysis of trends, and will avoid the need for extensive discovery onthese central issues when a market response rate request is filed. Additionally,the rule will require that special transportation cost data associatedwith Express Mail is available for use in these cases. The significance of this data can be seen from review of certain historicalExpress Mail statistics. The Postal Service Cost and Revenue Analysis (CRA)report for FY 1985 shows the average weight of Express Mail as 51 ounces.In Docket No. Rs7-I an Express Mail weight study presented by the PostalService showed average weight as 29.6 ounces. Similar changes appear involume and revenue per piece figures. The Revenue Pieces and Weight (RPW)report for FY 1988 shows volume increasing 6.27% (to 44.1 million) andrevenue increasing substantially less_1.32% (to $505.3 million). Thesefigures yield a revenue Per piece of, $11.46, yet we find an average revenueper piece of only $10.85 for the fourth quarter of FY 1988. These changes are particularly significant in light of the introduction,in Docket No. R87-1, of a reduced letter rate ($8.75) for pieces weighingless than eight ounces. While we recognize that the temporal proximityof these two events does not prove that one caused the other, it is suggestiveof a significant, rate related change in the volume profile of ExpressMail. But it also seems that the mix of Express Mail was changing towardlighter pieces even before this new rate was implemented. We conclude thatmore detailed information than is currently available will be needed topredict and evaluate the effect on volume and revenue per piece of marketresponse rate changes. We are therefore proposing to require quarterly reporting of: 1. Volume by rate cell, for each Express Mail service 2. Total pounds, for the volumes mailed respectively at: a. The letter rate; b. The uniform rate for pieces up to two pounds; and c. The uniform rate for pieces up to five pounds.  3. The pound-miles carried on the hub contracts (currently those operatingfrom Terre Haute, Indiana, and Las Vegas, Nevada).\26\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ <T3>See</T3> PRC Op. R87-1, paras. 3625-51, especially 3629. <ITAG tagnum="84">Impact of proposed changes. </ITAG>Pursuant to Executive Order 12291, the Commission finds that this proposedrule change does not constitute a ``major rule.'' It affects only rulesof practice governing hearing procedures, not the substance of the proceeding.Its economic impact will be negligible, including its impact on the costsor prices for consumers, individual industries, federal, state, or localgovernment agencies, or geographic regions. Additionally, the proceduralrule change will have no measurable effect on competition, employment,investment,   productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets. The above analysis that the rule change does not constitute a major ruleapplies, as well, to the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The proposed rule change does not contain policies with Federalism implications,and therefore does not warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment underE.O. 12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 3001 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Postal Service.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 39 CFR Part 3001 is proposedto be amended as follows. <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 3001_RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURES </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B_Rules Applicable to Requests for Changes in Rates or Fees</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart G_Rules Applicable to the Filing of Periodic Reports by theU.S. Postal Service. </ITAG>1.
