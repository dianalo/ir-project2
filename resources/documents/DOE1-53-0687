The drilling is themost important stage. Analysis work was improved thanks to the largecomputing capacities of computers, and the success ratio of exploratorydrilling was improved. Costs for discovering oil reserves are gettinghigher since their discovery is becoming more difficult. Study was madeabout the devlopment cost for production wells, expenses for productionand processing facilities, handling (transportation) cost, and investmentratio. As regards the trial balance of the operation and the overallcost, situations in the U.S. and U.K. were quoted. As to the influenceof low oil price, explanation was made about the repression of explorationand production, cost reduction caused by keen competition in the exploration,drilling and development activities resulting from less investment.
