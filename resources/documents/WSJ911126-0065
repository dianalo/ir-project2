The action by the House Ways and Means and Senate Financecommittees was part of a coordinated strategy to expeditepassage of the popular tax incentives before Congressadjourns for the year, perhaps today. The measure, which hasBush administration support, now goes to the House and Senatefloors. It still could be derailed if any lawmakers offerunrelated amendments.</LP><TEXT>   The most important elements of the package are credits forbusiness research and experimentation and for low-incomehousing development, and a 25% deduction for thehealth-insurance costs of the self-employed and farmers. Italso includes tax incentives for mortgage-revenue bonds andbonds to finance small manufacturing projects; for companieshiring the disadvantaged; for employee education andlegal-service benefits; for makers of so-called orphan drugsfor those with rare medical problems, and an exemption to thealternative minimum tax for donations of articles such asartwork.   To pay the $3.2 billion cost, in keeping with the budgetlaw's requirements, the measures would require corporationswith taxable income of more than $1 million a year to pay alarger share of their liability in their quarterly taxreturns. Currently, they must estimate and pay at least 90%of their liability; the bill would phase in an increase to95% by 1995, effective until 1997.   The intent of the chairmen, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D.,Ill.) and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), is to get thefinancing from the corporate interests that benefit most fromthe credits. The tax incentives, a diverse mix that ispolitically balanced to get support in both parties,typically are extended temporarily to avoid showing theirfull cost on federal books. Both chairmen were reluctant topush a bill, due to its cost and the prospect ofcontroversial amendments, such as Republican proposals to cutthe tax on capital gains. But lobbyists and lawmakers pressedhard, and the chairmen agreed to the last-minute maneuver topass the bill.   Congressional leaders agreed that the bill will be shelvedfor the year if it is amended. The provisions, if enacted,would be in effect through June 30; supporters expect to seeka new extension next year as part of a broader tax bill thatboth parties are espousing for economic stimulus.   Separately, the Ways and Means panel approved a resolutionsaying that current business acquisitions should be coveredif Congress enacts pending legislation creating a single,14-year depreciation period for so-called intangible assets,such as firms' customer lists. The panel had consideredvoting on the bill, spokesmen said, but decided to wait untilnext year.   And in the Senate, Chairman Bentsen introduced legislationthat would raise the amount that Social Security recipientscan earn without forfeiting any benefits. Under the Bentsenproposal, the limit would rise to $24,120 for 1996; thecurrent cap on earnings is $9,720. Sen. Bentsen would arrangeto pay for the change by slightly raising the amount of wageson which employers and workers pay to support the retirementsystem.   Meanwhile, House Republicans are continuing to insist thatCongress act now on a more far-reaching package of businesstax cuts to spark the economy. But Mr. Bush has said he wouldunveil his proposals in January, and only a demand from himfor immediate action would be likely to persuade Congress'sDemocratic leaders to remain in session in December. &quot;All ittakes is a phone call,&quot; House Speaker Thomas Foley (D.,Wash.) said. &quot;Were he now to reverse his position again,&quot;Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) said, &quot;. .. obviously we would have to consider that.&quot;   But the House GOP Leader, Rep. Bob Michel of Illinois,said Mr. Bush &quot;would like to make a brand new fresh start&quot; inhis January State of the Union speech. Mr. Michel said he'dproposed that Mr. Foley set March 15 for a House vote on atax bill.   The Republican leader has been uneasy with theconfrontational stance of other House Republicans --including the second-ranking leader, Rep. Newt Gingrich ofGeorgia. Like Mr. Bush, he wagers that Democrats would bashGOP plans as a boon to the rich and that the partisan discordwould further roil fragile financial markets.   &quot;It always begins with capital gains,&quot; he said of fellowRepublicans' so-called economic-growth plans. &quot;And hereagain, you ask the average guy, and he says, `I don't see howthat's going to affect me all that much.'&quot; Politically, Mr.Michel added, the proposal &quot;just reopens the whole debate onrich man-poor man.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
