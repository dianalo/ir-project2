A prospective pilot plant producing usable hydrogen (electrolysis)with the help of solar energy (photovoltaics) will be yielding up to65 000 Nm/sup 3/ hydrogen per year (solar irradiation 1 000 kWh/m/sup2//year). The 300 kW electrolytic system will be equipped with a pressuregas-hydrogen storage system buffering load variations. Additional pilotplants are planned to test the use of hydrogen in dual-purpose powerplants. The paper points out the expected marketing phase (to reach ashare of 50%) for the implementation of alternative energy sources totake 50 to 70 years. In addition, reference is made to the need for developingnew types of gas burners allowing the addition of hydrogen. (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
