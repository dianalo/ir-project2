The bid, which is valued at about $460 million, was contained in a letter delivered yesterday to Don Johnston, chairman and chief executive officer of JWT, from Martin Sorrell, WPP's chief executive and controlling shareholder. In the letter, Mr. Sorrell, who currently holds an 8% WPP stake, also said he had arranged for John E. Peters, a former top JWT executive, &quot;to come back to JWT in a senior management capacity&quot; if the merger is completed.    JWT didn't respond immediately to the merger proposal, and said it is reviewing &quot;all options including the WPP Group proposal to determine what course of action would be in the best interests of JWT Group's shareholders, clients, and employees.&quot; But Mr. Johnston has said repeatedly that he wants to keep JWT independent. Moreover, Mr. Peters's involvement appears to be intended to push Mr. Johnston aside. Mr. Peters, former chief operating officer of JWT's J. Walter Thompson Co. unit, was fired by Mr. Johnston earlier this year.    Industry executives viewed WPP's bid as merely the first salvo in a battle for control of JWT, which has been plagued by management upheaval and poor earnings. Many executives said they expected the fight to result in either a sale or restructuring valued at between $45 and $50 a share. Mr. Sorrell, in an interview, didn't try to damp speculation that he would raise his bid. The proposal &quot;is negotiable in all respects,&quot; he said.    He also said WPP had lined up $530 million in financing; that would give WPP the resources to bid as high as $53 a share. The executive declined to say whether he would pursue a hostile bid if he is ultimately rejected by JWT's board.    Wall Street clearly saw Mr. Sorrell's bid as only a first step. JWT shares rose $9.75 to close at $49 a share yesterday in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    In tackling JWT, WPP is taking on a company more than 15 times its size. In 1986, JWT had revenue of $641 million, and its J. Walter Thompson unit was the nation's fourth-largest ad agency. WPP in had 1986 revenue equivalent to about $37.9 million. Also, part of the financing WPP arranged calls for a rights offering, which would raise more than its total current market capitalization. The offering would raise about $270 million by issuing five new common shares for every three shares held. WPP's existing U.K. market capitalization is $208 million.    WPP's strategy is similar to that of Saatchi andamp; Saatchi PLC, a British concern that became the world's largest ad agency last year through an aggressive acquisition policy in the U.S. The similarity isn't coincidental; Mr. Sorrell was Saatchi's top financial executive until last year.    Other European marketing and media concerns also have been showing interest in U.S. acquisitions. Foreign concerns view the U.S. communications industry, the world's largest, as a fertile field for expansion, and the weak dollar has made acquisitions relatively cheap.    Some analysts and agency executives questioned whether JWT is worth more than Mr. Sorrell's bid. &quot;The initial bid is a very full one, and raising the price from here is going beyond what the company is worth,&quot; said Charles Crane, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. He asserted that few other companies have the resources or the desire to take on JWT. &quot;If there are any other bidders, I think the line at the door is very short,&quot; he said.    He and others said JWT is more likely to seek a friendly suitor or to restructure itself as a defense. JWT also has considered going private in a leveraged buyout, but financial analysts said it would be difficult for such a plan to top the WPP offer.    Securities analysts said the inclusion of Mr. Peters -- a 30-year JWT veteran -- in the buyout group gives the proposal added credibility. &quot;Having someone of his caliber associated with the offer . . . answers the question of who does he (Mr. Sorrell) think he is to run this company?&quot; says Alan Gottesman, an analyst with L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin Holdings Inc.    Considering the management turmoil at JWT in recent months, &quot;you need a familiar face who knows how to get business done and keep clients happy,&quot; he added.    In the interview, Mr. Sorrell indicated that he hoped installing Mr. Peters at JWT could entice some of the other half-dozen or so senior JWT executives who have left recently to return.    Mr. Sorrell, who characterized his proposal as a &quot;management buyout,&quot; is known to have spoken with a number of the departed executives over the past few months.    JWT's management has been turning over rapidly since January, when Joseph O'Donnell, then chairman of the Thompson unit and Mr. Johnston's heir apparent, was fired by the JWT chairman. Mr. O'Donnell had raised questions about Mr. Johnston's leadership of the company and had presented a buyout bid to the JWT board from an outside group. Mr. Peters was a supporter of Mr. O'Donnell.    WPP's bid seems to mark an about-face for the company, which has said it wants to build a network of nontraditional services, such as sales promotion, public relations and design. &quot;His (Mr. Sorrell's) whole argument was that he was moving in a fragmented industry of small companies that needed financial management. Now, suddenly he has to turn around and say, 'I'm in the same business,'&quot; said Lorna Tilbian, an analyst at Sheppards, a London stockbroker. &quot;It's going to be difficult justifying himself.&quot;    According to the plan, WPP, which said yesterday it owns 4.98% of JWT, would borrow a total of $530 million from two sources. Samuel Montagu andamp; Co. Ltd., its British financial advisers, along with Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd., yesterday underwrote a $270 million U.K. rights offering. WPP also received a commitment from Montagu and Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, to underwrite long-term debt of $260 million.    The size of the borrowing made some industry executives uncomfortable. New York-based Interpublic Group of Cos. own a small WPP stake, but &quot;we won't have the investment any longer,&quot; said Philip H. Geier Jr., chairman, chief executive and president. &quot;I predict disaster for the shareholders of that company (WPP) in England. The leverage is unbelievable,&quot; he said. &quot;It isn't good for the clients and it isn't good for the employees. I would hope that some Thompson clients would call (Mr. Sorrell) and say, 'Look, pal, you may be the biggest loser.'&quot;    Some analysts also questioned WPP's aggressive acquisition policy, which has rapidly boosted the company's growth and pushed its stock to glamorous levels in London. &quot;WPP is a sort of stock-market phenomenon that has been cobbled together by financiers who are interested in growth and acquisitions,&quot; said Luke Johnson of Kleinwort Grieveson Securities in London. &quot;It really does smack to me of buying for buying's sake, and the U.S. market and the U.K. market are increasingly turning against creatures like this.&quot;    (Revised WSJ June 12, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
