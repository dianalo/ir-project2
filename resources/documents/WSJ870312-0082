The quarterly gap, which followed a revised $37.15 billion deficit in the third quarter, surpassed the previous record of $37.35 billion in the 1985 fourth quarter. The previous record for a year was $124.44 billion in 1985. The department originally put the third quarter deficit at $37.67 billion.    The figures underscore the stubbornness of the trade imbalance, which has failed to improve despite the decline of the dollar against major foreign currencies in the past two years. For example, James Cochrane, chief economist at Texas Commerce Bancshares in Houston, pointed to the U.S. deficit with Japan, which increased to $14.8 billion in the fourth quarter and $54.6 billion for the year, even though the dollar has fallen sharply against the yen.    &quot;It's almost in defiance of economics,&quot; he said. &quot;One would have expected by the fourth quarter of 1986 that you would have some kind of improvement in that bilateral balance,&quot; he said. &quot;It's remarkable when you look at it.&quot;    Overall, the value of imports rose 3% to $95.7 billion after climbing 2.4% to $92.91 billion in the third quarter. That increase occurred despite a 1% drop in the volume of imports, as prices rose 4%. Among import categories showing big increases were consumer goods and Canadian passenger cars. Shipments of cars from South Korea and Japan fell.    For the year, imports rose 9% to $369.46 billion from $338.86 billion in 1985.    Petroleum imports rose 0.8% to $8.05 billion after increasing 1.9% to $7.99 billion in the third quarter. The average price of a barrel increased 11.5% to $12.73 from $11.42. In all of 1986, oil imports fell 33% to $33.89 billion from $50.53 billion in 1985, as the average price of a barrel fell 44.3% to $14.72 from $26.41.    Exports increased 2.8% to $57.33 billion in the fourth quarter after rising 1.3% in the third quarter to $55.76 billion. For all of 1986, exports rose 3.4% to $221.75 billion from $214.42 billion in 1985. Agricultural exports rose 9% in the fourth quarter, but fell 9% for the year.    Unlike the department's monthly merchandise trade figures, the quarterly balance-of-payment merchandise trade measure doesn't include the cost of insurance and freight in import totals. The balance-of-payment figures also make adjustments for certain exports to Canada that aren't recorded with the Customs Service, and exclude military transactions. In addition, the quarterly figures are adjusted for seasonal variation, while the monthly figures aren't. </TEXT></DOC>
