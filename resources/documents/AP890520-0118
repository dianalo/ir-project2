(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Strong, shifting winds Saturdaynight forced the Air Force to postpone the launch of a navigationsatellite designed to tell U.S. and allied forces their locationwithin 50 feet anywhere on the globe.   The postponement was announced with the countdown holding atjust four minutes before the intended blastoff time, 7:55 p.m.   ``The upper level winds are too variable to risk a launch of theAir Force Delta 2 rocket through that environment tonight,'' saidLt. Col. Ron Rand, the Air Force launch commentator.   The countdown had proceeded perfectly throughout the day whileweathermen kept a close watch on the upper altitudewinds. Rand saidlate weather balloon data indicated the velocities and directionsof shifting winds were too high to be safe. Wind velocities werenot reported.   A new launch date was scheduled for 7:51 p.m. Sunday.   Packed in the nose of the $30 million, 12-story rocket is a $65million Navstar Global Positioning System satellite, which willenable military units such as ships, planes, submarines and tanksto determine their location within 50 feet and in some cases towithin 10 feet.   The satellite will also keep track of their speed within afraction of a mile per hour and the precise time within a millionthof a second.   American and allied military users will receive information froma coded channel. Civilian users, who also have access to thesatellite system, will monitor an open channel that will providethem with a position accuracy of 300 feet.   The 3,675-pound Navstar GPS contains an atomic clock with anerror rate of one second every 300,000 years.   The satellite is the second of 21 upgraded Navstars that the AirForce plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992, givinganyone anywhere in the world 24-hour access to the positioninginformation.   The first advanced Navstar was launched aboard the maiden flightof the Delta 2 on Feb. 14.   Seven earlier model Navstar satellites are orbiting the Earth.The new model has more power and improved systems and has added thecoded military channel.   The Delta 2 is a more powerful version of the earlier Deltarocket that has been flying since 1960, logging 170 successes in182 launches.   It is one of at least 54 new unmanned rockets the Pentagon isordering in a $14 billion program to resolve a post-Challengercrisis that left about 40 reconnaissance and other nationalsecurity payloads languishing in storage for want of a launchvehicle.   The backlog was created by the grounding of the space shuttlefleet for 32 months after the 1986 Challenger explosion. TheDefense Department decided after the accident that it could notrely solely on the shuttle for access to space and ordereddevelopment of the Delta 2 and a more powerful Titan 4 rocket.   The Air Force originally had planned to launch all 21 of theadvanced Navstars on the shuttle. All now will fly on Delta 2s.</TEXT></DOC>
