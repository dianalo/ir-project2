The objectiveof this study was to develop a worst-practicable-case scenario of Armytroop exposure in training and then to calculate to total absorbed dosageand attendant cancer risk from a feasible number of repetitive exposuresat the site. Risk estimates were also made for civilian populations surroundingthe installation. This study recommends (1) the Army enforce its directiveto mask in the presence of HC smoke, (2) the Army closely regulate thedeployment of HC and other smokes on all of its installations, (3) studiesshould be conducted on Army installations to determine the risk fromHC smokes to which the soldier and local populace are exposed, (4) anannual HC smoke risk of cancer to soldiers of greater than 1 in 10,000should be reduced where perceived, and (5) the Army should adopt a safetyprinciple- as low as reasonably achievable -for both troop and civilianexposure to HC-smokes.</TEXT></DOC>
