Price, Director, TobaccoDivision, Agricultural Marketing Service, United States Department of Agriculture,Room 502 Annex Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090-6456, telephone_(202)447-2567.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Notice was given (53 FR 40069, October13, 1988) that the Department proposed to amend the regulations to establishseparate fees and charges on a per pound basis for permissive inspectionand grading services for export tobacco. Interested parties were givenan opportunity to comment on the proposed rule.Two comments were received from companies which export tobacco. Both statedthat they favor the proposed rule.The Department hereby adopts the regulations appearing in the proposedrule which provided for a fee of $.0025 per pound for the voluntary inspectionand certification of tobacco for export. Previously, the same hourly feehad applied to both the permissive inspection of tobacco for domestic useand for export.The Tobacco Inspection Act authorizes permissive inspections which aremade available to interested parties on a fee basis sufficient to cover,as nearly as practicable, the costs incurred by the Department for theinspection and certification of tobacco, including administrative and supervisorycosts. The Department had determined that the previous fees and chargesfor permissive inspections did not cover the costs for export inspectionand certification. The major factors causing the need for the separaterate are increases in salaries, travel and administrative costs. Differentpersonnel are utilized for the inspection and certification of tobaccofor export than for permissive inspection for domestic use because tobaccoprocessed for export in large lots is different in form than tobacco insmall lots on a warehouse floor or in a redrying plant.For the most part, seasonal employees are utilized for permissive inspectionfor domestic use and the program costs are their salary for the actualtime they are conducting permissive inspections, administrative and supervisorycosts, travel and per diem. However, personnel assigned to inspection andcertification of tobacco for export must be available year-round. The highercosts of personnel with the expertise needed for the inspection and certificationof tobacco for export will be attributed to the program that incurs thecosts. In addition, the amount of tobacco which will be exported in anygiven year is more easily estimated than the amount of time which willbe necessary for inspection and certification of tobacco for export. Thus,a per pound fee is a more appropriate method of recovering the costs ofthe inspection and certification of tobacco for export.The previous fee was $26.60 per hour, plus travel expenses and per diem.Revenues (for export tobacco) for the 12-month period beginning June 1,1987, were about $43,000, with costs of about $57,400. In FY 1989, it isestimated that approximately $70,000 in revenues would be generated andthat program costs would be approximately $69,900.In order to cover the Department's costs of providing permissive exporttobacco inspection and certification, the fee should be $.0025 per pound.In addition, miscellaneous conforming changes are made to various provisionsin andSection; 29.123. This final rule is the same as the proposed rule exceptfor changes in punctuation.The final rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures established to implementExecutive Order 12291 and Departmental Regulation 1512-1 and has been determinedto be a ``nonmajor rule'' because it does not meet any of the criteriaestablished for major rules under the Executive Order.Additionally, in conformance with the provisions of Pub. L. 96-354, theRegulatory Flexibility Act, full consideration has been given to the potentialeconomic impact upon small business. Most of the firms which would be affectedby this final rule do not fall within the confines of ``small business,''as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Administrator, AgriculturalMarketing Service, has determined that this action would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This final rulewould not substantially affect the normal movement of the commodity inthe marketplace. Compliance with this revision would not impose substantialdirect economic costs, recordkeeping, or personnel workload changes onsmall entities, and it would not alter the market share or competitivepositions of small entities relative to large entities. Furthermore, theDepartment is required by law to fix and collect fees and charges to coverthe Department's cost in operating the tobacco inspection program.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 29</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Tobacco.Accordingly, the Department hereby amends the regulations under the TobaccoInspection Act contained in 7 CFR Part 29 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 29_TOBACCO INSPECTION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B_Regulations</ITAG>1.
