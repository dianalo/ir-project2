A grand jury has indicted a former director of Capitol Bancorp., the ninth-largest commercial bank holding company in Massachusetts, on illegal lending and racketeering activities in connection with the operation.    According to the indictment, Sidney J. Weiner, 57 years old, who resigned recently as a director of Capitol and Capitol Bank andamp; Trust Co., its main subsidiary, used his position &quot;to facilitate the affairs&quot; of the loan shark operation, which federal investigators describe as the biggest they have ever uncovered. Jeremiah O'Sullivan, chief of the federal Organized Crime Strike Force in Boston, said that Mr. Weiner and 10 other men made $2.5 million in loans at rates of as much as 7% a week.    Capitol, which isn't charged in the indictment, declined to comment on the case. Mr. Weiner, who resigned his post at the bank in April, couldn't be reached for comment.    The grand jury indictment, handed up last week in federal court in Boston, says that the group conspired to collect loans from debtors of the bank &quot;through the use of force and violence.&quot; It also charges that the group conspired &quot;to provide bank loans to debtors,&quot; so that the debtors could repay the group at &quot;usurious&quot; rates.    Mr. O'Sullivan declined to elaborate on the charges, or to say how much of the $2.5 million involved the bank's money. He said the two-year-old investigation is continuing, but wouldn't say whether more indictments are expected.    Among the 11 indicted thus far are two former policemen from Revere, Mass., and the former head of a local Hell's Angels motorcycle club chapter.    Enforcement authorities said the loan-shark group collected more than $3.5 million from 350 borrowers on loans made between November 1980 and March 1986.    Frank Walczak, president of Capitol Bank andamp; Trust, declined to comment on the case, but said the bank is pursuing a related internal investigation. Mr. Walczak, who joined the bank in January, also declined to say what reasons, if any, Mr. Weiner gave for his resignation.    Arraignment of the 11 indicted men is scheduled for Friday. </TEXT></DOC>
