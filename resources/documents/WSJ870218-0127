Cooper also raised its quarterly dividend on common 5% to 42 cents a share from 40 cents, payable April 1 to stock of record March 2.    The maker of tools and drilling and compression equipment said the so-called poison pill measure wasn't in response to any efforts to acquire the company.    Cooper will distribute to stock of record Feb. 27 one preferred-stock purchase right for each common share held. Cooper has about 48.4 million shares outstanding.    Each right entitles the holder, in the event of a hostile takeover, to buy about $350 of the surviving company's stock for $175. The rights, effective for 10 years, will be exercisable only if a party obtains a 20% stake or launches a tender offer for 30% or more of Cooper. The board can redeem the rights at one cent each. </TEXT></DOC>
