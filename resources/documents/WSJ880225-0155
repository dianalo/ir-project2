The energy company's filing, under a &quot;pre-petition solicitation&quot; provision of the code, anticipates a reorganization plan that already has been submitted and approved by a majority of equity and debt holders. Because of the procedure, Anglo said it hopes the reorganization process &quot;will be a short one,&quot; as well as less expensive to the company.    Anglo's predecessor company operated under the Bankruptcy Code from late 1983 to August 1986. The company paid more than $12 million in legal and other fees during that period.    A spokesman said that despite approval of the plan by most creditors, &quot;there is really no way&quot; to get 100% approval. The Chapter 11 filing protects the company from creditor claims while it completes a reorganization plan. The spokesman said the solicitation procedure has been used in a few other cases.    A major provision of the plan would exchange about $110 million of debt obligations outstanding for about 30 million new Class A common shares, a move which will eliminate most of Anglo's debt. However, issuance of the new shares would dilute the holdings of existing Anglo shareholders, giving them about a 21% voting stake in the company. The new Class A shares also have certain preferential liquidation rights and special voting rights through at least 1991.    About 51% of Anglo Energy is held by Equity Strategies Fund, a New York investment company. If the proposed plan is approved, Equity will hold about 28% of the company's voting power; a unit of J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., about 18%; and a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, about 5.5%.    Anglo operates three oil well drilling companies, mainly in Alaska. </TEXT></DOC>
