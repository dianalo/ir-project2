<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-45-1131 </DOCNO><TEXT>The possibility of developing new processing strategies for high-temperatureintermetallic compounds is being investigated. In particular, rapid solidificationfollowed by controlled heat treatment may provide new and unusual microstructuresof multiphase materials. This report describes research performed atNBS to develop predictive models for solubility extension and metastablephase formation of intermetallic compounds and research to improve thephase diagram modeling of systems involving ordered phases. Theory hasbeen clarified to treat the interface shape stability for intermetalliccompounds during solidification. Using modified variables to describethe phase diagram near an intermetallic compound the solidification conditionsrequired to avoid microsegregation were obtained. Experimental researchhas been conducted on three intermetallic systems, Aluminum-niobium,Nickel aluminum-nickel titanium, and Titanium-aluminum to gain experimentaldata base for theoretical model development using melt spinning and examinationby transmission electron microscopy.</TEXT></DOC>
