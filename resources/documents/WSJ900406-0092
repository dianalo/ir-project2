Prices of European and Middle East crude oils dropped asmuch as 25 cents a barrel -- some falling for the secondstraight day. In the U.S., futures prices of crude oilplunged as much as 45 cents a barrel while refiners rushed toreduce field postings by 50 cents.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The problem is a buildup in excess supply,&quot; said PhilipVerleger, a visiting fellow at the Institute forInternational Economics and an authority on oil-pricebehavior. &quot;OPEC is not cutting production enough,&quot; he added.   Oil prices had been expected to soften some in the secondquarter, which is traditionally a sluggish demand period. Butthis week's declines are earlier -- and far larger -- thanhad been expected.   The declines began Wednesday in the wake of a Wall StreetJournal article on a rise in production by the Organizationof Petroleum Exporting Countries and after industry reportsthat crude oil inventories in the U.S. are expanding fasterthan anticipated. OPEC production now is at the highest levelin eight years, and U.S. crude oil inventories are thelargest in at least two years.   Most oil prices now are below those of a year ago whenthey were rising because of fallout from the Alaskan oilspill and from North Sea production mishaps. Prices of a fewcrudes still are near $20 a barrel, but most are below thatpsychologically important level.   In European spot markets yesterday, North Sea Brent forMay delivery was down 20 cents a barrel to $18.10, accordingto the Dow Jones International Petroleum Report. In U.S.futures trading, the May contract for West TexasIntermediate, or WTI, fell 35 cents to settle at $19.43 abarrel. And new field postings for this U.S. benchmark crudegenerally are $18.75 a barrel.   &quot;As it cracks $20, WTI is the last indicator {among theworld's benchmark crudes} to reflect global fundamentals,&quot;said William H. Brown III, international oil analyst atKidder, Peabody andamp; Co.   Until now, Mr. Brown and other analysts added, WTI hascontinued to hold relatively firm -- even as prices of othercrudes eroded -- because it is a light &quot;sweet&quot; crude that islow in sulfur content. These crudes are best for yieldingpreferred fuels such as gasoline.   Most of the pricing pressure has been on the &quot;sour&quot; crudes-- those that are high in sulfur and often are very densesuch as the heavy crudes of the Middle East. With Kuwait andsome other Middle East members of OPEC producing beyond theirquotas, the heavy and high-sulfur crudes have been pouringinto the market. Some countries such as Iraq, Iran and SaudiArabia are understood to be offering steep discounts to somecustomers to maintain their market shares.   &quot;The big overhang {in inventories} is in the sour crudes,&quot;said Marshall Thomas, editor in chief of the Oil Daily.   Despite the surplus of sour crudes, West TexasIntermediate and other light crudes still would have heldfirm in price if the gasoline market had remained as strongas expected, analysts said. But there suddenly are signs ofnew weakness in the gasoline market.   As a result, prices of gasoline are coming down, at leastat the wholesale level. The futures price of unleadedgasoline for May delivery fell 1.57 cents a gallon on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange yesterday, settling at 63.29 cents.The June contract fell 1.71 cents to 62.16 cents.   &quot;We are looking for a decline in gasoline demand thisyear,&quot; said Mr. Brown of Kidder Peabody.</TEXT></DOC>
