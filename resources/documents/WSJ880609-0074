Chicago-based Ameritech and US Sprint Communications Co. of Kansas City, Mo., joined forces to win a $108.1 million contract to provide local and long-distance services for the state of Illinois. Separately, MCI Communications Corp. received a large contract award from Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner andamp; Smith Inc. to provide domestic and international long-distance services. The Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. unit refused to disclose the size of the contract but MCI called it a multimillion-dollar award.    The contract awards were viewed in the industry as further indications that ATandamp;T faces tougher competition for large customers. &quot;Just a few years ago, companies weren't willing to use any other service. That's changing now,&quot; said Edward Greenberg, a telecommunications analyst at Morgan Stanley Co. &quot;ATandamp;T is starting to lose some important chunks of business.&quot;    In the past six months, for example, MCI has received big contracts from the Social Security Administration, UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and the Defense Department. ATandamp;T also had been vying for the contracts. Moreover, MCI is beginning to capture pieces of a customer's traffic that had been the domain of ATandamp;T. In April, Procter andamp; Gamble Co., which is served primarily by ATandamp;T, expanded its contract with MCI.    &quot;As we gain the confidence of companies, we're able to get more business,&quot; said H. Brian Thompson, MCI executive vice president of marketing. &quot;It's a gradual process.&quot;    A spokesman for ATandamp;T acknowledged the increasing rivalry. &quot;There's no doubt but that ATandamp;T is facing ever tougher competition in the business for large customers,&quot; he said.    The competition could get still keener if Ameritech, and the other six regional Bell telephone companies, form more accords with other long-distance providers. Until now, the Bells have complained that they lose bids to provide communications networks for large customers because they're barred by court order from providing long-distance service.    &quot;Customers are looking for a package. They want one-stop shopping,&quot; said Perry Erhart, senior marketing director for Ameritech's Illinois Bell unit. &quot;I think you'll start to see more of these agreements.&quot;    David H. Yedwab , a telecommunications consultant, said the alliances are a way for the Bell companies to work around the restrictions and provide their customers with local and long-distance service under one umbrella.    In the Illinois contract, Ameritech's Illinois Bell unit and US Sprint, a joint venture of GTE Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc., will provide a voice and data communications network that will link state agencies to all state government locations.    Wall Street reacted favorably to Ameritech's announcement. The company's stock closed up $2.50 at $93.625 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.    Washington, D.C.-based MCI will provide Merrill Lynch with supplemental domestic and international voice and digital services. DuWayne Peterson, executive vice president of Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner andamp; Smith, said ATandamp;T will remain the primary provider of long-distance services to the company. However, he said &quot;MCI's role will get larger in the scheme of things.&quot;    In national-over-the-counter trading, MCI closed at $14.625, up 50 cents. ATandamp;T closed at $27.25, up 62.5 cents, in Big Board composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
