The movemay signal the opening of a lucrative niche in Japan'sfinancial markets.   Invesco MIM Asset Management (Japan) Ltd., the Tokyoinvestment management unit of London-based Invesco MIM PLC,was chosen earlier this week by Nagasakiya andamp; Co., one ofJapan's largest retail chains, to manage 1 billion yen ($7.85million) of its corporate pension fund.</LP><TEXT>   The funds entrusted to Invesco under the deal represent atiny sliver of the 25.6 trillion yen in total Japaneseemployee pension assets for which investment management firmsare allowed to compete. It's also only a fraction ofNagasakiya's 23.7 billion yen total employee pension assets.   Still, the contract may mark the beginning of much widerparticipation by foreign firms in what hitherto has been oneof the most carefully sheltered -- and potentially profitable-- corners of Japan's giant financial-services market.   Until recently, the business of managing Japan's vast poolof pension fund capital has been the exclusive preserve ofthe nation's huge trust companies and life insurers. Butassets managed by those domestic institutions have earneddismal returns by international standards, and foreignershave long alleged they could do the job better if given thechance.</TEXT></DOC>
