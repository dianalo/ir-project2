The Japanese government and the Taiwanese fishing industry, mainusers of the fishing technique, will be asked on Monday to acceptthe convention, which bans driftnet fishing across large areas ofthe Pacific.   Delegates attending a week-long meeting in Wellington pledged towork to eliminate drift net fishing from the region.   Most governments in the area already have barred drift net boatsfrom their waters.   The area covered by the convention stretches from the MarshallIslands in the north, French Polynesia in the east, New Zealand inthe south and Australia in the west.   But the regional governments do not have the power to force thedriftnetters from international waters, where they string theirnets across the tuna migration paths.   Philipp Muller, chairman of the Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency,told reporters there had been ``signs of co-operation'' from Japanand Taiwan but added: ``They will want to take the protocols backhome and there will be long discussions.''   Japanese diplomats are attending the conference and a delegationfrom the Taiwan Deepsea Tuna Fishing Boat Owners and ExportersAssociation is due to arrive on Monday.   Countries represented at the conference are to sign theconvention at government level within the next few weeks, bindingthemselves to taking action if they have not already done so.   The regional governments fear the driftnetters will seriouslydeplete albacore tuna stocks within two years, endangering thefragile economies of island states which depend on fishing.   A U.S. Senate move Wednesday and a Taiwanese pledge to cut itsSouth Pacific fleet have raised hopes the technique could beoutlawed or discouraged.   Senior Taiwanese officials have said the country would send 24drift net boats into South Pacific this season, compared with 60last year.   The Senate has voted to bar imports of tuna caught by the driftnet fishing, which is known as ``wall of death'' fishing becausethe 60-mile nets entrap and suffocate virtually everything in theirpath.   The bill is aimed mainly at tuna imported from Japan and Taiwan,worth about $250 million last year.   South Pacific countries represented at the conference includeAmerican Samoa, Australia, Cook Islands, Federated States ofMicronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands,Nauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea,Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Western Samoa.</TEXT></DOC>
