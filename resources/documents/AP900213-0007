The story of a Los Angeles detective who wakes up from aseven-year coma and avenges his family's murder debutedimpressively despite apparently being held in low regard by itsstudio and star.   Warner Bros. failed to screen the film for critics, and evenSeagal has badmouthed it repeatedly. The film collected $7,082 perscreen to lead the top 10, Exhibitor Relations Co. said Monday.   Cruising along in second place was ``Driving Miss Daisy,''featuring Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman in a comedy about aSouthern widow and her black chaffeur. The film grossed $6.5million.   Disney's remake of ``Stella,'' staring Bette Midler, fell fromfirst to third with receipts of $3.7 million, followed by theanti-war saga ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' which slipped 25percent to fourth place with sales of $3 million.   The new picture, ``Loose Cannons,'' teaming Gene Hackman and DanAykroyd, came in fifth with $2.2 million.   ``Stanley andamp; Iris,'' the story of adult illiteracy with JaneFonda and Robert De Niro, weakly debuted in sixth with $2.1million. In seventh was the action-adventure movie ``Tango andamp; Cash''with $1.8 million.   The black divorce comedy ``The War of the Roses'' landed ineighth place on a box-office collection of $1.73 million. Thepolice thriller ``Internal Affairs'' was ninth with $1.71 million,and the ensemble drama ``Steel Magnolias'' was 10th on sales of$1.6 million.   ``Time of the Gypsies,'' the last Columbia release developed byousted studio head David Puttnam, opened on two screens with a veryaverage haul of $23,476. The film has to be dubbed in every moviehouse in the world because the dialogue is composed in an extinctgypsy language.
