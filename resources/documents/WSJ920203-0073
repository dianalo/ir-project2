The review follows the EC's recent finding ofdisproportionate costs for phone calls between Europeancountries and between towns in the same country. Calls costconsumers two to four times as much as those in the U.S.while distances for the connections are far shorter.   The EC Commission previously took a laissez-faire stanceon national phone firms, which had said calling monopolieswere needed to cover costs of maintaining and modernizingnetworks. The commission will put this defense to the test.   National phone monopolies exist in 11 of the EC membercountries; competition has been set up in the 12th, Britain,though customer choices aren't wide yet.                                                                                                          TAIWAN RECOGNIZES CHINA'S MONEY                                                                                                          Taiwan's High Court, in a landmark ruling, recognized aslegal tender the renminbi currency of China. The court ruledthat the renminbi was valid because it is circulated interritory claimed by Taiwan and used by its citizens.Previously, Taiwan had refused to treat the renminbi as alegitimate unit because Taipei, which claims sovereignty overall of China, doesn't recognize the communist government inBeijing. Economists have said Taiwan's recognition of thecurrency was needed because of expanding economic ties withChina.                                                                                                          PERU TO ACCELERATE PRIVATIZATION                                                                                                          Peru will speed up selling off 100 unprofitable statecompanies as part of its program to open up the economy,Economy Minister Carlos Bolona said. But he cautioned againsthopes for a quick economic recovery after four years ofrecession, saying Lima's financial problems could worsen. Thegovernment is negotiating with prospective buyers of 15 largeand 85 smaller companies, including the state airlineAeroperu, the copper mining company Centromin and the ironmining firm Hierroperu. Lima also wants to negotiatedevelopment of the Camisea natural-gas fields in southernPeru.                                                                                                          AFRICAN NATIONS ACT ON TRADE                                                                                                          Leaders of 18 African nations pledged to move quicklytoward establishing a regional common market. ThePreferential Trade Area of Eastern and Southern Africa saidit would take the initiative to merge with the 10-memberSouthern African Development Coordination Conference, aneconomic bloc that shares some members with the PTA. In aconference in Zambia on economic cooperation, the PTA saidhaving two blocs with the same aims was wasteful. The SADCC,meeting in Mozambique, called for increased consultations andcoordination.                                                                                                          CANTON TO OPEN UP TO CAPITAL                                                                                                          Canton is moving apace to set up China's third stockexchange, and foreign banks will be allowed to open branchesin the southern city soon, Deputy Mayor Lei Yu said. At least10 companies plan to issue Class B shares, those available toforeigners, soon after Canton's stock market opens, he said,but didn't specify a date. Trading in B shares is to start inShanghai's bourse Feb. 20 and soon thereafter in the marketin the Shenzhen special economic zone, marking the first timeforeigners may deal in Chinese stocks since the 1949Communist victory.                                                                                                          WORLD STEEL ACCORD SAID NEAR                                                                                                          Agreement could come soon, after two years of talks, onopening up world steel trade, European Community sourcessaid. A multilateral accord is needed by March 31 to avoid atrade war and replace the 10-year-old market-sharing systemof voluntary restraint agreements on steel exports. Both theU.S. and EC want to drop the quota system, preferred byJapan, and to introduce free competition, banning governmentsubsidies and eliminating tariffs. Under current rules, theEC's largely state-owned steel sector limits exports to 7% ofthe U.S. market in return for freedom from countervailingduty actions by U.S. steelmakers.                                                                                                          JAPAN FALTERS ON WORK GOAL                                                                                                          Japanese workers spent an average of 2,016 hours on thejob last year, down 2% from a year earlier and the biggestdrop since a 3.5% decline in 1974, mainly resulting fromovertime reductions.   But the Labor Ministry characterized last year's reductionas too little. The government is aiming for 1,800 hoursannually by mid-1993, but a ministry spokesman said, &quot;We mayneed several more years to meet the goal.&quot;   A survey of companies with at least 30 employees showedregular working hours last year dropped an average of 25, or1.5%, to 1,841, while overtime plunged 11 hours, or 6.8%, to175.   Average monthly pay, meanwhile, rose a net 0.4% to 384,919yen ($3,062), the smallest change since 1981. Regularsalaries increased 4.2% but overtime allowances decreased 2%.

Taiwan's population at the end of last year rose almost 1%to 20,555,000 from a year earlier. The island's populationdensity was 570 per square kilometer, the second highest inthe world after Bangladesh. . . . After double-digit annualgrowth in the previous four years, 54 major Japaneseconstruction companies' orders in 1991 rose only 1.4% from ayear earlier. And housing starts in Japan slumped 20% to 1.4million from 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
