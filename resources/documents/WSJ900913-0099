Barring unexpected developments, the Bush administrationnow intends to sit tight without making big policy changesfor at least the next several weeks, senior administrationaides say. During that period, the White House will wait tosee whether economic sanctions are really squeezing Iraq, andthe U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf will becompleted as shiploads of big tanks arrive.</LP><TEXT>   Then, at some point in October or November, Mr. Bush andhis top aides are likely to sit down together to decidewhether sanctions are inflicting enough pain to force Iraq toreverse course in Kuwait. If the embargo is seriouslypinching Iraq, the president probably would choose to stay onhis current course awhile longer. And officials insist thatthey are optimistic about the sanctions, despite new hintsthat Iran may help Iraq circumvent them.   But there's another scenario that may be more likely: Ifthe trade embargo is leaking, or if it appears that thesanctions will take too long to have a real impact, PresidentBush will face the question of whether a military strike isnecessary to achieve his unambiguous goal of driving Iraq outof Kuwait.   With no meaningful diplomatic efforts under way to findanother course of action, and no certainty that sanctionsalone will do the trick, the odds remain high that,eventually, the current crisis will turn to war. Rep. DavidObey (D., Wis.), head of the House's foreign-operationssubcommittee, recently returned from a trip to the PersianGulf and said he saw &quot;a far better than 50-50 chance&quot; offighting.   Administration officials will talk only vaguely abouttheir precise timetable for such decisions. &quot;What we'll bewatching for over the next few weeks are signs that thesanctions are in fact biting,&quot; says a senior administrationofficial. &quot;If they are having an effect, then clearly that'sa guide to future action.&quot; Another U.S. policy maker says he&quot;wouldn't be surprised if by another month we had moreindications than we have now.&quot;   Because of the administration's current focus onsanctions, Mr. Bush didn't explicitly threaten militaryaction in his nationally televised speech to Congress thisweek, only saying elliptically that &quot;all options&quot; are beingconsidered. But a variety of signs indicate that while theodds of a military conflict right now don't seem high, theybegin escalating starting in October and November.   &quot;My view is that we will continue on this track for thenext eight weeks,&quot; says Barry Rubin, an analyst at theWashington Institute for Near East Policy, who has closelyfollowed the evolution of U.S. policy since Iraq's Aug. 2invasion of Kuwait. &quot;By the time we get to Nov. 15 ormid-December, there are a number of factors that cometogether.&quot;   By that time, as administration aides note, it will beclearer whether sanctions are working. In addition, enoughtime may have passed for the U.S. to argue credibly to theworld community, which it wants to keep united in oppositionto Iraq, that it has given economic and diplomatic pressuresample time to work against Saddam Hussein.   At the same time, U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia and thePersian Gulf will have reached full strength. Despite therapid rise in the number of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, tomore than 100,000 today, they have lacked the large numbersof tanks U.S. military commanders would want in anyfull-fledged fight with Iraq. Those tanks arrive byslow-moving ships.   There also is the chance that if the confrontation withIraq isn't resolved by winter, U.S. public support and themorale of troops camped in the Arabian desert may begineroding. That could push the administration to bring thecrisis to a head before then.   In the fall, of course, Mr. Bush's decision making alsowill be affected by a big domestic event: the Nov. 6congressional and gubernatorial elections. If Mr. Bush wereto contemplate a decision as momentous and politically diceyas an attack on Iraqi troops, he might want to wait untilafter the election has passed. (Some Democrats, on the otherhand, are beginning to worry that Mr. Bush may use an&quot;October surprise&quot; military action to whip up a patrioticfervor that would help his Republican Party in time for thevote.)   In any case, some analysts suggest that if Mr. Bushreaches a point at which he concludes that economic sanctionssimply won't be enough, he should pause before turning tomilitary action and first deliver a clear ultimatum to SaddamHussein.   Such a message would flatly warn that military action iscoming if Iraq doesn't move out of Kuwait within a week ortwo. That kind of unambiguous warning might force SaddamHussein for the first time to seriously contemplate his fateif he doesn't reverse his occupation of Kuwait. &quot;The reasonto make it very clear that war is coming is to exhaust thelast chance that he will blink,&quot; says William Quandt, aMiddle East analyst at the Brookings Institution. &quot;It may bethe case that the only way to get someone like Saddam Husseinto look at the choices confronting him is to make war lookinevitable.&quot;   It's also conceivable, of course, that if the U.S. reachesa point where it concludes that economic sanctions won't beenough, it could turn not to the military option but to moreserious negotiations with Saddam Hussein to find acompromise. Arabs now supporting the tough U.S. stand alsocould switch strategies and consider offering Iraq billionsof dollars and land concessions to withdraw from Kuwait.   But such a course of action seems less and less likely asMr. Bush grows more and more definitive in his declarationsthat Iraq will be forced to withdraw without any reward.&quot;Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait completely, immediately andwithout condition,&quot; Mr. Bush said in his address to Congressthis week.   Ironically, countries that might want to help Iraq now bycircumventing economic sanctions may actually be increasingthe prospects of war against Baghdad later, when the worldcommunity concludes that sanctions won't produce enoughpressure. But at this point, administration officials insistthat they are pleasantly surprised by how well economicsanctions are working. They say the flow of goods into Iraqthrough neighboring Jordan has slowed to a trickle. And theydoubt that Iran will allow big quantities of food and goodsinto Iraq, despite a call by its religious leader yesterdayfor a holy war against the U.S. and reports from Tehran thatIran may send food and medicine in return for refinedpetroleum products.   The question that Mr. Bush and his aides will face thisfall will be how long they can or will wait for sanctions tohave their full effect. &quot;My own belief is that it may bepossible to get Saddam Hussein to withdraw unilaterallywithout military action, but the question is whether we'rewilling to wait that long,&quot; says Mr. Rubin.   ---                    Crisis Chronology                                                                                                                   Events in the Persian Gulf Crisis                                                                                                          Aug. 2 -- Iraq invades Kuwait                                                                                                          Aug. 2 -- U.N.
