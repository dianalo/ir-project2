F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department'sForeign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was sold by threeprivate companies, which will receive subsidies under thedepartment's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.   Dickerson said 712,950 tons of wheat remain in the SovietUnion's current EEP allocation. Only wheat has been approved forsale to the Soviets under the price subsidy program.   The seventh year of the U.S.-Soviet grain agreement began Oct. 1.   With the latest sales, the Soviet Union has bought more than 3million tons of wheat for 1989-90 delivery and more than 12.7million tons of corn, plus soybeans and soybean meal. All of thewheat was sold under EEP arrangements.   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushelsof wheat. The 175,000 tons are equal to more than 6.4 millionbushels worth about $23 million at recent U.S. farm prices.   Dickerson reported the subsidies at an average of $34.13 perton, or about 93 cents per bushel.   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat andother designated commodities to specified countries at reducedprices to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect freegovernment surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, orsubsidies.   Dickerson said the latest wheat was sold by J. Aron andamp; Co.,100,000 tons; Union Equity Cooperative Exchange, 50,000; andMitsubishi International, 25,000.</TEXT></DOC>
