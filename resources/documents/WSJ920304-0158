Under the bill being considered by the Senate Labor andHuman Resources Committee, the market exclusivity for anorphan drug would end after annual sales for that productreached $200 million. Currently, makers of orphan drugs, ordrugs used to treat rare diseases, have a seven-year salesmonopoly.</LP><TEXT>   Similar legislation was killed by President Bush inNovember 1990 after being passed unanimously by both theHouse and Senate. Mr. Bush opposes the bill on the groundthat it could discourage manufacturers from developing suchdrugs. Yesterday, in testimony before the Senate committee,David Kessler, Food and Drug Administration commissioner,said the revised version doesn't differ substantially fromthe vetoed bill.   In 1983, Congress passed legislation designed to make thedrugs commercially viable by allowing the developers sevenyears as sole producers of their product.   But Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), co-sponsor of thebill with Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R., Kan.), argued that &quot;ahandful of profiteers&quot; are using the legally protectedmonopoly to &quot;charge absurdly high prices for blockbusterorphan drugs.&quot;   Drug manufacturers are split on the issue. The Associationof Biotechnology Companies argued the bill would encouragedrug innovation by effectively removing the orphanclassification from drugs with high sales. But thePharmaceutical Manufacturers Association claimed theincreased government reporting requirement would be enough tostop a company from initiating such research.   Dr. Kessler told the committee that limiting the monopolywould discourage development of orphan drugs and unfairlyharm companies that have made long-term investment decisionsbased on current law incentives. Mr. Metzenbaum claimed thatargument was faulty because the development of two of the sixorphan drugs with the strongest sales began before the 1983law passed.   In a letter to the committee, Health and Human ServicesSecretary Louis Sullivan said that he would recommend a vetobecause the measure would &quot;ultimately deny needed therapiesto people suffering from rare diseases or conditions.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
