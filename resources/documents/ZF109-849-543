(AMD),delivered an address entitled FDDI To The Desktop, New Perspectives From AMD.andO;The November 1990 issue of the LOCALNetter (p.andP;  198) featured several salientexcerpts from Mr. Sykes's addressandgt; this Special Report consists of a lightlyedited transcription of the entire address.andM;AMD has been involved in Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) work sincethe standard's inception.andP;  AMD began shipping production volumes of the firstVLSI circuit solution for FDDI in December 1988.andP;  The duration of our FDDIexperience and the knowledge we have gained from our customers and strategicpartners have given us substantial insight into FDDI market developments.andM;AMD is bullish on FDDI.andP;  We believe FDDI will grow to rival the shipments ofEthernet and token ring as FDDI's cost and the end-user price of FDDIstations decline.andM;Fiber, however, will serve only a portion of FDDI nodes, as copper cablingpresents a viable, low-cost alternative.andP;  Key to the selection of fiber overcopper media will be the cost of FDDI compatible optical data links (ODLs) atthe PMD layer of FDDI.andM;Optical component makers have an urgent need to address this compelling FDDIissue: What share of a potentially very large but cost-competitive marketwill optics makers serve?andM;A Transformation Affecting FDDI's FutureandM;Initially, most people assumed all FDDI stations would be connected by dualfiber-optic rings.andP;  But, in 1990, we have begun to see the beginning of atransformation in network cabling architectures.andM;In the 1960s and 1970s telephony provided the model network architecture:built on managed (switched) point-to-point links, the telephone network wasdesigned for easy, economical support of a large end-user population.andP;  Modemsprovided a reliable--but slow--data communications capability.andM;In the 1980s, in seach of higher data rates than those available over thetelephone network, data communications users moved to higher-bandwidth media:coaxial cable and data-grade shielded-twisted-pair wiring.andP;  These mediadictated LAN architectures.andP;  The architectures that emerged, typified byEthernet and token ring, resulted in LANs that were cumbersome to installand, as networks grew in size, extremely difficult to manage and maintain.andM;In the 1990s, because of the increased capabilities of integrated circuits,we see a return to the managed, point-to-point links of the telephonyarchitecture.andP;  This architecture, typified by the specifications for 10BASE-TEthernet, centers on concentrators or hubs to ease network managementproblems.andP;  We see this hub-based architecture becoming the core of futuredata networks supporting other standards including 802.3 Ethernet, tokenring, and FDDI.andM;Concentrator-based architecture offers a new playing field for FDDI.andM;FDDI In 1992andM;In 1992, we believe that the preferred FDDI topology for new and evenretrofitted installations will be hub-based.andP;  This hub-based architecture, aphycial tree, is already supported in the FDDI standard.andM;In this type of installation [see the Figure below], most end-stations willbe single-attachment stations (SASs) generally less than 100 meters from thehub.andM;The 100-meter limit circumvents the two-kilometer maximum specification fordistance between stations originally targeted for FDDI and allows alterativemedia between end-stations and hubs.andP;  Alternatives include copper cabling,glass fiber using lower launch-power optical data links than required to meetthe current standard, and plastic fiber.andM;The Copper AlternativeandM;AMD's LAN customers, concerned with cost-reducing their products, aresupporting standards for low-cost FDDI connections.andP;  Data-gradeshielded-twisted-pair and coaxial cable solutions already have been provenviable in the lab.andP;  Unshielded-twisted-pair solutions are also underdevelopment.andM;We believe the unshielded-twisted-pair alterative is the most desirable.andP;  Itis extremely low-cost, already installed in many facilities, and also worksfor the telephone, ISDN, 10BASE-T Ethernet, and token-ring networks.andM;Fiber Optics Opportunities In The New FDDI EnvironmentandM;We see three opportunities for fiber optics in the new FDDI environment:andM;* Long runs between buildings or campus networks--the back-end marketandM;* The departmental LAN market--including the internetworking applicationsrequiring high data rates to interconnect existing token-ring and EthernetLANsandM;Small workgroups--the high-volume PC market [refer to the Figure below]andM;The back-end market will move to single-mode fiber for its long runs.andO;Single-mode fiber is favored here because it accommodates future gigahertzbandwidth requirements and will provide interconnection between LANs overgreat distances.andP;  The back-end market is not price-sensitive.andM;Departmental LANs and internetworking are often controlled by MISorganizations.andP;  MIS managers prefer fiber cabling for its inherentadvantages: future bandwidth upgrades are possible, and fiber offers noiseimmunity and low error rates.andM;The small workgroup/high-volume PC market, where AMD sees the greatestpotential shipments for FDDI, is not always under the control of MIS.andP;  Thismarket is very price-sensitive.andP;  We believe that optical data links at a $100price can begin to serve this market in 1991, particularly to networkhigh-performance workstations.andP;  ODL prices, however, will have to besignificantly decreased to be competitive in later years.andM;With connections of less than 100 meters, low launch-power FDDI-compatibleoptical data links are acceptable, which should provide an opportunity foroptics manufacturers to meet future price points.andM;Copper wire is a viable alterative in this market, though we believeend-users will pay for the benefits of fiber if aggressive cost reductionscontinue.andM;Market Projections And Opportunities For FDDI In The FutureandM;Most FDDI market forecasts assume that back-end/internetworking and technicalworkstation markets represent the predominant FDDI applications.andM;Projections from International Data Corporation (IDC) are representative ofthis view of the FDDI market [see Talbe].andM;We believe there is a major, unforecasted, market opportunity for FDDI in thesmall workgroup, high-volume, PC market.andM;Forecasts from Dataquest indicate the huge potential of this market.andP;  Tenmillion new PC nodes of all kinds will be installed in 1992 and 20 million in1994.andP;  Also, some percentage of existing PC LANs will be available forupgrading to FDDI.andP;  By 1994, Dataquest projects, there will be 60 million PCsalready connected to LANs [refer to the Table below].andM;FDDI can--if low prices are achieved--attract a noticeable portion of thishuge market.andP;  The PC opportunity dwarfs all other FDDI market opportunitiesin size.andM;We believe desktop computation power and application software requiring FDDIbandwidths will be ready by 1992.andM;When desktop FDDI stations are economical, end-users will provide the marketpush--but, end-users' overriding concern will be price.andP;  We believe thatoptical data links will have to reach a $25 price if fiber is to serve themajority of this high-volume desktop computer market opportunity.andM;Components of end-user price--with what we estimate are essentialprice-points for optical data links--are shown below:andM;Whether over fiber or over wire, we believe FDDI will be a major component ofthe desktop LAN market.andP;  Our view of the potential market for FDDI is shownin the chart below.andP;  If FDDI, in 1994, is used in only ten percent of thetotal new installations of PC LAN connections, this alone will be a twomillion-unit market opportunity for FDDI.andP;  If FDDI is used to upgrade onlyfive percent of the installed base, this will add another three million unitsto the 1994 market opportunity.andM;ConclusionandM;The predominant LAN physical cabling architecture, beginning in 1992, will beconcentrator-(hub-)based.andP;  Most FDDI connections, beginning in 1992, will usesingle-attachement stations on links of 100 meters or shorter.andP;  Lowlaunch-power FDDI-compatible ODLs supporting fiber cabling or copper cablingcan serve these connections.andP;  We expect the FDDI standard to be expanded toinclude these desirable alternatives within this timeframe.andM;It there are significant price reductions in optical data links, then fiberwill be preferred in the small workgroup, high-volume desktop/Pc market thatwe believe has a unit potential dwarfing all others.andM;We believe that, if appropriate price points can be met by optical data linksuppliers, fiber will continue to dominate the FDDI market.andM;(AMD can be reached at 901 Thompson Place, P.O.
