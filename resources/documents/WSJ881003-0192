The latest monthly survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management found that gains in production and new orders were less vigorous in September than they've been for months. But export orders, which have fueled much of the expansion lately, continued to grow. Price increases also slowed during the month, the report said.    &quot;Virtually all indicators confirm a decided slowing in the growth of the economy,&quot; said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the group's business survey committee. Still, he said, &quot;the high level of new orders signals continued growth in October,&quot; and &quot;the improvement in the inflation rate suggests a healthy beginning for the fourth quarter.&quot;    The reading comes when many economists and traders are fence-sitting, waiting to see whether August's soft employment report will be confirmed by statistics due out this week. The weaker jobs data in August relieved fears that the Federal Reserve would have to raise interest rates again soon in its attempt to fight inflation by curbing credit.    In the latest report, the purchasing agents' index for September fell to 54.8%, down 1.4 percentage points from August and its lowest level in six months. The index measures new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventory and employment. A reading above 50% indicates that the economy is generally expanding, while a reading below 50% signals that the economy is generally contracting.    The report is compiled from data provided by more than 250 purchasing managers. The September reading marked the third month in a row that the index declined. But it was also the 26th consecutive month that the measure exceeded 50%.    Last month, the purchasing managers' organization began calculating indexes on the various sections of its survey. The indexes reflect the percentage of &quot;positive&quot; responses received -- such as firms saying production or prices were higher -- plus one-half of those saying conditions were unchanged. The numbers are then seasonally adjusted.    On prices, the latest report said the pace of increases &quot;slowed significantly&quot; in September, indicating &quot;a welcome sign of abating inflation.&quot; Although prices continued to rise, the price index slowed to 72.2%, its lowest level since a 67.8% reading in May 1987. Growth in new orders, meanwhile, also slowed but remained high enough to suggest continued output growth in October, the report said.    Among members who export, 27% reported higher orders, compared with 20% in August. But the percentage was still well below the 37.8% average for the previous seven months. Production grew at a slower pace than in the previous month.    Employment increased for the fourth month in a row, although at a slower rate than in recent months, mirroring the slower production gains. The employment index, at 50.2%, was the lowest since June's 50.1%.    Vendor delivery times stretched out again in September, but not as broadly as previous months. Slowing delivery times usually indicate a growing economy.    Corrugated shipping containers -- historically an indicator of economic activity -- didn't rise in price during September, making only the second time in the past 30 months that the containers' prices failed to increase.    However, the economy isn't yet out of the inflationary woods. Items listed as in short supply or higher in price far outnumbered the materials that dropped in price during the month. Among items in short supply were aluminum, copper, nickel, stainless steel, bleached paperboard, plastic resins, sugar and several chemicals.    Materials that went up in price included aluminum products, copper, steel products, various kinds of paper, plastic products and chemicals as well as several foods and food products. Zinc was the only item listed as dropping in price, although there were &quot;some reports of price decreases&quot; in fuel oil.    Several stock and bond traders said rumors about a weaker purchasers' report were circulating Thursday and Friday and helped sustain rallies. A slowing economy would mean the Federal Reserve would be less likely to raise interest rates to stave off inflation. The survey is being released today, although advance copies were sent to the media as usual on Friday. A spokeswoman for the purchasers' group said the rumors &quot;were started by traders.&quot; She said the survey wasn't leaked.    &quot;We don't have a way of tracking down (the rumors) because the distribution on this report is so widespread,&quot; she said.    The organization's Mr. Bretz, who is also director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc., said the group is reviewing the distribution process. &quot;We're reviewing the entire list -- who gets it, how they get it and what time they get it,&quot; he said.    Despite the purchasing agents' report, this week's data may suggest that the economy will continue to be strong.    Meanwhile, two reports due out this week may shed further light on whether the economy is at a turning point in the six-year-old expansion or merely a pause.    The September employment data will arrive Friday, and the consensus view calls for a stronger showing. Economists surveyed by MMS International Inc., Redwood City, Calif., expect the unemployment rate to slip to around 5.5% from August's 5.6%. They also estimate that payroll employment grew by about 283,000 in September.    Today's report on August factory orders could point toward continuing strength. The consensus view calls for a gain of 3.4% from July, when orders fell 3.5%. Backlogs also are expected to be up.    &quot;If hiring is good, orders are good and industrial output is good, it's very hard to say the fourth quarter will be weak,&quot; says Robert Gay, senior economist at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. The data coming out of the industrial sector indicate &quot;the economy is still pretty brisk,&quot; he says.    But Albert Sindlinger, a Wallingford, Pa., consumer pollster, sees things differently. Mr. Sindlinger's firm compiles the Sindlinger Household Liquidity Index, which measures family finances, through a nationwide telephone poll.    &quot;The economy is more than softening; it's definitely turned around,&quot; Mr. Sindlinger says.    On the Sindlinger index, a reading of 50% or lower is considered recessionary, while a reading of 63% or higher signals strength in the consumer sector. The gauge measures the percentage of households with positive cash flow. Interviewees are asked several detailed questions including whether their household income is higher or lower than it was six months ago and whether their place of work has added or cut jobs during the period.    The index took a plunge right after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in August, in what appeared to be a reflex reaction by rate-sensitive consumers. The index slumped 9.3 percentage points to 62.3% then, and it has slipped further since. The latest reading is 57.7% for the three days ended Thursday.    Mr. Sindlinger and others figure that consumers are highly sensitive to short-term rate moves because of the widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages. In the first quarter, 56% of all loans for housing units accommodating one to four families -- including second mortgages and home equity loans -- were keyed to a variable rate, according to a recent study by the American Bankers Association.    &quot;The drop in expectations is particularly coming from California, New England and the Southeast, where most of the adjustable-rate mortgages and highest property inflation are,&quot; Mr. Sindlinger said. &quot;The middle section (of the country) is fine.&quot;    Another gauge of consumer demand due out this week is September auto sales. Sales of North American-made cars and trucks jumped 9.9% in midmonth, and the pace is expected to continue strong through the rest of the year.    Overall, consumer spending has slowed since last year's stock market crash, but it's still at a level that worries some economists. Consumer credit slowed sharply in July, reflecting sluggish sales. Too much spending at home, coupled with heavy demand for exports, could overload an industrial sector that is already running near capacity.    &quot;We've slowed the consumer sector from a run to a walk -- not a stop,&quot; said Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. He believes that it was a &quot;misreading&quot; to interpret August's employment data as portending a slowdown.    Mr. Straszheim expects a strong September employment report this week. &quot;If we're right on the number, the economy is still growing,&quot; he said.    And if the jobs report causes a stir this week, it could get even more attention next month -- when the report will be released just days before the presidential election.    ---   SLOWER SERVICE: The service sector leading index compiled by the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University inched ahead at an annual rate of 0.1% in August, down from a revised 1.7% in July. &quot;Economic growth in the service sector seems likely to continue at a slower pace in the near term,&quot; said Allan P. Layton, who compiles the gauge. The coincident index grew at an annual rate of 3.1%, down from 4.6% in July.    ---                 The Economy in Numbers       Statistics Released in the Week Ended Sept. 30                                             CHANGE                                             (from prior                                 TOTAL       period    Money Supply      M1 -- Week ended      Sept. 19 (in billions)     $784.9      +$2.5      M2 -- Week ended      Sept. 19 (in billions)     $3,037.0    -$0.7      M3 -- Week ended      Sept. 19 (in billions)     $3,857.7    +$3.3    Leading Indicators    August, index                193.4%      +0.4%    Farm prices    Sept., index                 145%        +0.7%    New homes sold    August, annual rate          713,000     +0.1%    New jobless claims    Week ended Sept. 17          291,000     +2.5%    Purchasing Managers'    Index    September                    54.8%       -1.4    Sindlinger Positive    Household Liquidity    Percentage    Three-day period    (Sept. 27-28-29)             57.7        -0.1%            Statistics to Be Released This Week    Unemployment rate (Fri.)
