The finding suggests that a type of acquired immunedeficiency syndrome vaccine may be more effective thanscientists had previously thought. The scientists cautioned,however, that it still may take several years to develop andtest a safe and effective AIDS vaccine.</LP><TEXT>   The vaccine involved in a human experiment at JohnsHopkins University medical school was genetically engineeredby Micro-GeneSys Inc. of West Haven, Conn. Similarexperimental vaccines have been developed by Bristol-MyersSquibb Inc. and by Genentech Inc., which announced last weekthat its vaccine had protected two chimpanzees againstdeliberate infections with the AIDS virus and that tests inhumans might begin this summer.   The experimental vaccines are known as subunit vaccines,because they are made only of certain proteins that coat thehuman immunodeficiency virus, HIV-1, which causes AIDS. Mostconventional vaccines are made of a whole virus. The hope isthat the viral surface protein alone will trick the body'simmune system into launching an attack against HIV-1.   The three companies each have their own version of asubunit vaccine made with an HIV-1 protein known as gp160.The vaccine is designed to trigger an immune attack onanything that displays gp160.   Most vaccines, including AIDS vaccines, are aimed attriggering the body to make antibodies that will disable theinfecting virus. But in AIDS, the virus wreaks its havoc byworming its way into certain white blood cells, where itescapes the attack by antibodies. The virus's destruction ofthese infected blood cells is what cripples the immune systemand causes AIDS.   There has been some question about whether the subunitvaccines, such as those made with gp160 protein, can trickthe body into activating &quot;killer&quot; lymphocytes that willdestroy cells that are infected with the deadly virus. If so,the vaccines would be more effective than if they justactivated antibodies against the freefloating virus.   The new experiment at Johns Hopkins, reported in thisweek's issue of Science, indicated that the gp160 vaccinewill, indeed, activate killer cells that attack HIV-infectedblood cells. But the vaccines did so in an unexpected way.   In their experiment, the researchers vaccinated eighthealthy human volunteers with four extremely small doses ofthe MicroGeneSys gp160 protein. They then extracted thelymphocytes from the blood of the volunteers. Laboratorytests found that lymphocytes from three of the volunteersdid, in fact, kill HIV-infected cells.   &quot;This was the first time this vaccine was used in humans,so we used extremely low doses on the order of 40 thousandthsof a gram,&quot; noted co-author Robert F. Siliciano in explainingwhy only three of the eight patients appeared to respond tothe vaccine. Tests are under way to see whether higher doseswill produce immune responses in a greater proportion ofvolunteers.   As they proceeded in their laboratory experiments, theresearchers found that the killer lymphocytes were of a typeknown as CD4-positive lymphocytes. These CD4-positivelymphocytes ordinarily don't operate as killer cells. Yet thevaccine had done something to turn them into killers.   Moreover, the CD4-positive lymphocytes picked out anddestroyed only those cells that were infected and ignoredcells that had accidentally picked up scraps of the HIV-1virus on their surfaces.   The tests also indicated that the CD4-positive killersactivated by the vaccine will destroy cells infected byalmost any version of the lethal HIV-1 virus. Scientists haveworried that a vaccine may be effective against only one or afew of the several varieties of the HIV-1.</TEXT></DOC>
