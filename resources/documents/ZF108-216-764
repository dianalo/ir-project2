(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>COLOR ELECTRONIC PREPRESS: THE ART FORM IS CHANGINGandM;Before the Print'80 show the concept of color electronic prepress didn't evenexist.andP;  At the show, Scitex introduced its system, and the idea took off in amodest way.andP;  Scitex, Hell, Crosfield and others provided high end systemsthat could handle page composition, color design, proofing, touch-up, andcolor correction.andP;  These systems  - which often cost well into the sixfigures substituted capital costs and operator training costs for the laborand outside service bureau charges inherent in the old ways of getting colorphotographs and art ready for the web offset printers most commercial orin-plant printers used.andP;  A small but measurable market was born.andM;But in less than ten years, the ubiquitous workstation has shaken up themarket before it had a chance to settle.andP;  The multi-MIP marvel has broughtcolor prepress  - or lesser-function, workstation-based color electronicprepress  - to the desktop.andM;This shift didn't happen in a vacuum.andP;  It coincided with changes whichtechnology worked on the goals of printing automation.andP;  Now that most textand a good bit of design and graphics work is done directly on computer, nowthat scanner technology has improved even as prices have fallen, and now thatthe 20 megabytes of storage it takes to store one 8-1/2 by 11 page with twofour-color images doesn't cost all that much  - now what the printingcommunity is aiming for Direct Digital Color Proofing (DDCP) orDesign-to-Print, or TPE (Total Publishing Environment), or the Fifth Wave.andM;These all refer to a concept which at least appears simple: the ability totake text, images, and graphics, compose them into pages, and print thosepages in color  - without the tedious steps of today's largely manual processand at a lower cost in color proofs and separations.andM;We haven't reached that goal yet.andP;  Instead where we seem to be in the marketis here:andM;* At the high end vendors like Scitex, Hell, and Crosfield continue to sellhigh performance color prepress systems, making up for dropping system costswith an ever widening array of functions and peripherals.andM;* At the low end commercial and in-plant publishers use PCs to some degreeand Apple Macintoshes to a greater degree along with a rich array of softwarepackages, scanners, and laser and thermogaphic printers to produceseparations.andM;* In between, some companies use aggregated low-end tools to short-circuitsome of the formerly manual steps without requiring the expense of moreintegrated, dedicated all-function systems.andM;An example of the latter case: McGraw Hill's &quot;Business Week,&quot; which uses anAtex publishing system for copy automation, composition and layout, butMacintoshes for graphics and art work.andP;  Although the graphics andillustrations are output in color separated film, the magazine has yet to getinto full page composition.andM;In short, the market has a well-defined, and by now well-tapped high end  -where six or seven figures for electronic color prepress systems arejustified - and a kaleidoscopic low-end characterized by a hodge-podge ofpiece-meal alternatives that include scanners, workstations, graphicssoftware, composition software, page definition languages, output devices,film recorders, color proofers, design workstations, LANS, and so on.andM;And this assortment doesn't include the wide array of services that can beused as an alternative.andP;  Over 70% of all magazines send their color pages outfor separations, for instance, according to a survey recently published by&quot;Magazine Design andamp; Production&quot; magazine.andM;But confusing as the low-end is, its impact on the market is not.andP;  SanJose-based market researcher Dataquest, for instance, in a 1988 forecastpegged the North American market for pagination workstations and colorseparating scanners at just under $240 million and expected the market togrow to $270 million in 1992.andP;  As if to underscore the importance of thelow-end market to the future of electronic color prepress, the high-endvendors have been looking for ways to accommodate it.andP;  Crosfield, forinstance, now has facilities for accepting the output of several desktoppublishing systems to input directly to a Crosfield Studio system, where itcan be integrated with color images.andM;Rather than simply accept desktop publishing files into its process, Scitexhas developed its own system, called Visionary, for designing pages on aMacintosh.andP;  Visionary output can then be input to a Scitex Response colorprepress systems where resolutions can be enhanced.andM;In part the market's profile results from the vast difference in colorrequirements between those who print for profit and those who print out ofnecessity.andP;  To the profit-oriented, like magazine publishers, color meanscompetitive survival; they have learned to work with it and accept its price.andO;The latter group, like most in-plant printers, are waiting for pricethresholds to be passed  - and may even then balk for lack of workers skilledin color production.andM;&quot;The market is broadening,&quot; notes Kathy Tobler, a research analyst inDataquest's Electronic Publishing Market Analysis group.andP;  &quot;And we know thatthere's major color demand from corporate publishers coming.andP;  We just don'tknow when.&quot;andM;This corporate acceptance of color will come as the result of a combinationof factors, such as:andM;* The availability of cheap color copiers,andM;* The increase in direct-to-print color technology or, conversely,andM;DDCP,andM;* The availability of higher resolution scanners at lower prices,andM;* The availability of low-cost color inkjet and laser printers,andM;* The competitive use of color, andandM;* End user and in-plant employee color literacy.andP;  This last point iscritical.andP;  Even now many color publishers prefer not to send their color workout to color separators because they lack the skilled personnel to run thecomplex equipment or handle the intricate manual skills still required ingetting a piece of color art reproduced in print.andM;&quot;Time&quot; magazine, for instance, has installed a total publishing system worth$22 million that includes a satellite network, while archrival &quot;Newsweek&quot;uses an outside color prepress firm under long-term contract.andM;In fact, the relationships between publishers and color service vendors arechanging.andP;  In many cases service firms are asking for longer term contractsbecause of the capital requirements of color prepress technology.andP;  The flipside is that in many cases the capital equipment spending plans of servicefirms has become a key criterion in their selection by customers.andM;But despite all the technology a seamless high-end/low-end market join  -i.e., a lessening of confusion and a rise in foreseeable shipments  - is notlikely.andP;  The individual components of low-end desktop color prepress systemssimply aren't up to high quality color reproduction: * desktop monitorsaren't useful for color proofing; * the resolution of desktop publishingsoftware and page definition languages, like PostScript, is too low; * Thelow-priced color scanners lack the functionality required to output colorseparated film that will result in good continuous ton images.andM;Even with the million-dollar color electronic prepress systems getting thecolor right is an art form, not a science.andP;  Although the industry is learningto accept off-press color proofing from specially produced color output, likeDupont Chromalins, there's still an element of chance involved in going fromproofs to print.andP;  Variables like ink mixtures, paper absorbency, humidity,press calibration, and even the idiosyncrasies of individual pressment allcome into play.andP;  So expecting desktop color prepress systems to get it rightis asking a lot.andP;  A lot of the early corporate color pioneers will bedisappointed when they realize how complex color printing can be.andP;  But coloris coming.andP;  The forecasts for color hardcopy devices coming out of BIS CapInternational, for instance, anticipate a fivefold growth in unit shipmentsbetween 1988 and 1993, from 5,000 units to 25,000 for a revenue growth from$1 10 million in 1988 to $470 million in 1993.andM;These figures are for the graphics arts industry  - the segment of the marketserved by color separators, prepress houses, and printing service bureaus.andO;The overall acceptance of color can be seen in the total color hardcopymarket, which BIS Cap sees growing from $1.6 billion to $4.5 billion in thefive years between 1988 and 1993 To net out our market picture, it's this:andM;* The increase in digitized image and text capture and the continuallyfalling prices of digital technology are driving the prepress market towarddirect-to-print and direct digital color proofing.andM;* The vendors of the high-end equipment that served the top of theprofessional publishing market are starting to downscale and unbundle theirofferings to handle lower-end needs.andM;* Desktop publishing technology is rapidly coming to grips with color andhelping to foment change (and confusion) at the low end.andM;* The corporate in-plant printing market has yet to embrace color in a bigway, but a number of technology trends are converging that will make thishappen.andM;At that point expect color usage by former black-and-white users to besomething like color TV.andP;  Once they go color, they'll stay.andP;  And wonder howthey ever lived without it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
